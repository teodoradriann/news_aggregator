    "text": "Videos by OutKick\nWelcome to the Bills Mafia, son.\nThat was the message from diehard Bills fan Alexis, who goes by Love Lexi within the Bills Mafia world, shared Monday morning after she finished a shift as a snow shoveler with her 14-year-old son, Darius, as the franchise attempts to hold a playoff game against the Steelers this afternoon in some of the craziest conditions the NFL has ever seen.\nThe official snow total in Orchard Park as of Monday morning stood at 18 inches, but the local weather experts said the total at Highmark was around two feet. Put it this way, the stadium is buried, the team is asking fans to be patient with parking because the lots are a mess and fans are going to be sitting on piles of snow.\nBuffalo native Alexis describes her mother-son bonding experience from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Monday morning as a “great time.”\n“We stepped up for the team and community,” mom told OutKick Monday morning. “We are huge Bills fans and felt we wanted to support as much as we can. My son has never been to the field and wanted to get a point of view for the game he’s been watching on TV.”\nAnd the two of them got paid for the experience of a lifetime.\n“We didn’t go on the field. But we were pretty darn close. We saw lots of memorable stuff. Such as offices, training center, and the locker room.”\nAccording to OutKick readers who live in western New York, Alexis and Darius were shoveling snow inside Highmark Stadium at one of the toughest moments during the weekend lake-effect storm that has shifted slightly to the north and away from Orchard Park enough for blue skies to come out this morning.\nAfter one foot of snow fell Saturday night, another two feet dumped on the mother-son team as they battled the elements.\nAlexis estimates 70 snow shovelers were working during her shift. “My son was the youngest and there weren’t many women,” she added. “Maybe seven women out of 70 people.”\nAs of Monday morning, Highmark Stadium needed more shovelers, but, as OutKick sources from western New York pointed out, many people had to go to work and many others have jobs working at bars and restaurants where they’re preparing for the notorious Bills Mafia members who have worked up an appetite.\n“It’s bad. Field is cleaned, but we have to focus on the stairs, rather than the seats,” one of our sources relayed. Another noted that as of Noon Monday, there were approximately 40-50 people clearing snow inside the stadium.\n“It’s going to be rough to be in the stands,” a snow plow operator told OutKick.\nAt this point, it is what it is in Orchard Park. It’s time to play a game.\n“The Steelers better hope they lose, or they’re getting snowballed to hell,” wrote another OutKick source.",

    "text": "PACIFIC POWER Two Oregon Jewish federations become first in the U.S. to divest their investments from fossil fuels Federations for Portland and Eugene cite Jewish values and economic sense in their decision, which was backed by the Dayenu environmental nonprofit Courtesy/Dayenu Two Jewish federations in Oregon — one in Portland and the other in Eugene — are the first in the country to remove fossil fuels, the main drivers of climate change, from their investment portfolios. Leaders of the federation cite Jewish values in making the move, an initiative backed by the Dayenu environmental nonprofit, which was announced on Wednesday. “Taking action on climate change – the existential threat of our time – is an important way we ensure Jewish life and culture can thrive l’dor vador, from generation to generation,” the leaders wrote in a [statement.](https://jewishportland.org/jewishreview/jr-stories/our-values-compel-us-to-move-away-from-fossil-fuels) Hank Kaplan, a board member at the Jewish Federation of Greater Portland and chair of the Jewish Community Relations Council, said in a statement that the move makes “plain financial sense.” “In addition to being the main driver of the climate crisis, fossil fuels are a declining industry and have underperformed the rest of the market over the past decade,” Kaplan said. In a separate statement, Martha MacRitchie, chair of the Jewish Federation of Lane County, which includes Eugene, added: “Our Federation board unanimously determined this to be a reasonable, financially prudent action in the face of the climate crisis.” The votes to divest were supported by Dayenu, a group that mobilizes Jewish support for climate crisis action. Withdrawing funds from the leading drivers of climate change is just one step toward aiding the crisis. But Rabbi Jacob Siegel, the group’s climate finance adviser, emphasized that the financial arena is “a key area in systemic solutions.” As greenhouse gas emissions fill the Earth’s atmosphere, they trap the sun’s heat, resulting in global warming and climate change. Last year was the warmest year on record. In addition to harming the environment, fossil fuels pose a risk to health. [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487) [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487) in 2021 from Harvard University, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London found that more than 8 million people died in 2018 from fossil fuel pollution — meaning that air pollution from burning fossil fuels was responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. While more than a third of the 1,600 institutions that have made similar commitments to divest from fossil fuels are faith-based, only a handful come from the American Jewish community. The same week that the two Jewish federations in Oregon voted to divest, earlier this month, the state legislature [passed a bill](https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/briefs/legislature-passes-bill-to-rid-oregons-public-employee-retirement-system-of-coal-investments/) to direct the state’s pension fund to pull $1 billion invested in coal. MacRitchie expressed hope that other federations nationwide will follow suit and “are concerned about the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis on Jewish life.” The two federations in Oregon don’t directly manage their investment money. Rather, the donor-advised fund Oregon Jewish Community Foundation directs investments and makes grants on behalf of donors. The federations adapted to the climate-conscious change by utilizing the foundation’s fossil-fuel-free pool. Siegel pointed to the group’s All Our Might campaign, which calls for an end to financial support for fossil fuels in faith-based communities. In December 2022, Dayenu [published](https://dayenu.org/climateinvest/) a report, a snapshot of Jewish communal investments, which highlighted a $3 billion opportunity to move institutions’ investments out of fossil fuels and into clean energy solutions. The report offered a six-step road map and resources for Jewish institutions. “The idea wasn’t to invoke shame or guilt, but rather a positive sense of opportunity,” Siegel told eJP. He added that the impetus of the campaign is the V’ahavta prayer. “We say ‘you shall love God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might,’” Siegel said. “All your might has been interpreted by some commentators, for example Rashi, as all your assets, all your power.” The 146 Jewish federations nationwide have turned their attention to aiding Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks, but Siegel said he does not believe this will derail others from adding climate to their agenda. “We knew that this was not an either-or decision… Climate is being increasingly added to the list because federations are seeing it as a Jewish issue,” he said. “I think it’s growing as people recognize the urgency of the climate crisis in this crucial window of time.”",

It should be remembered that the rescue was made possible amid an exceptionally complex external and internal political situation, and the Bulgarian political elite showed reason, responsibility and a sense of national and all-human duty, the post reads. \"Today, when the political time makes us face no less complex challenges, we should not allow the destructive forces of hate, division, and confrontation in our country and in Europe.

It then lost to Lithuania (93-80) and Latvia (84-72). As reflected in these results, the Puerto Rican team went from strength to strength. Therefore, the five setbacks mattered little because, once they made their debut in the tournament, the team coached by Nelson Colón overcame South Sudan and China in the group stage, and then defeated the team from Jamaica (this time with Towns) in the second round. Finally, they failed to beat the Italians for a place in the quarterfinals. But it was a great tournament. So much so that Puerto Rico finished in twelfth place and as the third best team in the Americas. Earlier this month, and with only one game against Lithuania, the Puerto Ricans sealed their pass to Paris 2024 after an impressive performance in the Olympic Playoffs in San Juan, where they prevailed over Italy and the Lithuanians, when they had not beaten a European rival since 2016. The moméntum kept growing until the four setbacks came in the last two weeks against Greece, Australia, Canada and Spain. Worry or “gasoline” that will push the National Team to reach its full potential? The phrase “gasoline” was used by coach Colon on the occasion of last year’s World Cup, after the last few friendly defeats. Without further ado, here are five key points from the four losses to the fourteenth (Greece), fifth (Australia), seventh (Canada) and second (Spain) ranked in the world according to the FIBA rankings. The Puerto Rican team allowed just 67.8 points per game to its four opponents (Bahrain, Italy, Mexico and Lithuania) in the Olympic Playoffs. However, except for the great result against Greece in a friendly on July 16, the Puerto Ricans concluded their preparation for 2023 in reverse: from more to less. Against the Greeks, who were without their star player Giannis Antetokounmpo, as well as Nick Calathes and Giannis Larentzakis, Puerto Rico was defeated 67-65. In fact, they entered the fourth quarter with a 58-48 lead. However, the Europeans came back. But it was the final score that left a good feeling, as it was a continuation of what was seen in the playoffs. The story was different in the next three games: a 90-75 loss to Australia, and 103-93 and 107-84 defeats against Canada and Spain, respectively. Not even in the FIBA windows from 2021 to 2023, nor in the World Cup, did a team score more than 100 goals against Puerto Rico. And Canada and Spain did it in a three-day period. Puerto Rico shot 38.8% from three-point range in the Olympic Playoffs, the best percentage of the tournament. That was not seen in the four recent games. Against Greece, they shot a poor 26.5% (9/34). Then, while they improved against Australia and Canada with 38.7% (12/31) and 46.7% (14-30), they got worse against Spain with 34.8% (8/23). At the free throw level, they missed their only two attempts against Greece. They then registered 71.4% (10/14) vs. Australia, 73.3% (11/15) against Canada, and 66.7% (10/15) against Spain. The Puerto Ricans committed 13 turnovers against Greece and Australia, while they had 18 and 19 against Canada and Spain, respectively. That’s a bad sign considering that group rivals like the United States and Serbia would punish the Puerto Ricans in scoring conversions with that much turnover. Point guard Tremont Waters committed four turnovers against Greece, another four against Australia, three against Canada and three against Spain. Some 14, the leader in this category for Puerto Rico. Jose Alvarado registered 11. Puerto Rico was outrebounded 41-27, 43-37 and 36-35 by Greece, Australia and Canada, respectively, but dominated Spain 39-31 on the boards. However, the Spaniards managed more steals, by 11-8. Likewise the Australians (10-6) and Canadians (10-5). The Puerto Ricans also dished out fewer assists (22-17) than Greece, (30-19) Australia, (30-22) Canada and (34-14) Spain. They also had the same or fewer blocks against the same order of opponents (3-1), (2-1), (2-2) and (6-2). During the playoffs, the three Puerto Rican guards led the offense: (Jose) Alvarado and (Tremont) Waters averaged 16.0 and 15.3 points in 23.6 and 24 minutes per game. Also guard Jordan Howard was the third best scorer for the Puerto Ricans with 11.3 points in only 14.8 minutes on the court. In the four games, Alvarado was the second best scorer against Greece (11 points), did not score against Australia, was the best scorer for Puerto Rico with 21 points against Canada and the best against Spain, with 19. Waters, on the other hand, only scored six points in each game against Greece and Australia, five against Canada and nine against Spain. The Carolina Giants star point guard in the BSN, whether or not it has to do with his statements demanding better treatment for the players of the National Team, has not been the same as in the playoffs. Neither has Howard, who only contributed two points against Greece, three against Australia and eight against Spain. Puerto Rico makes its debut on July 28 in Group C action against South Sudan. Then, on the 31st of this month, it plays Serbia and ends the group stage on August 3 against the United States. --- This content was translated from Spanish to English using artificial intelligence and was reviewed by an editor before being published.

    "text": "[Geral](/geral)\nTrabalhadores da PepsiCo estão em greve contra jornada 6x1\nTrabalhadores da PepsiCo continuam em greve, nesta sexta-feira (29), pelo fim das escalas de 6 dias de trabalho por 1 dia de folga, além da oposição a 6 dias de trabalho por 2 de folga. Na próxima segunda-feira (2), está marcada audiência no TRT-2.\nNo último domingo (24), trabalhadores das unidades de Itaquera e Sorocaba decidiram entrar em greve. A decisão tomada em assembleia foi motivada, segundo o sindicato da categoria, pela postura intransigente da empresa e recusa em dialogar sobre a jornada de trabalho.\n“Diante da tentativa arbitrária da PepsiCo de implementar a jornada 6x1 e 6x2, propusemos a jornada de trabalho espanhola como alternativa [alternar entre uma semana de 48 horas e uma semana de 40 horas]. Porém, mesmo com nossas insistentes solicitações para um diálogo construtivo, a empresa se manteve inflexível”, divulgou o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias de Laticínios e Alimentação de São Paulo e Região (Stilasp).\nO sindicato considera a postura da empresa inaceitável, considerando que há atualmente uma [mobilização nacional](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/politica/noticia/2024-11/proposta-sobre-fim-da-jornada-6x1-movimenta-redes-sociais) pelo fim de jornadas de trabalho exaustivas. “Nossa luta é para que todos trabalhadores tenham qualidade de vida e saúde mental.” A entidade não tem estimativa de adesão dos funcionários à greve.\nO tema ganhou repercussão nacional em novembro em razão da [proposta de emenda](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/radioagencia-nacional/politica/audio/2024-11/proposta-de-por-fim-jornada-6x1-ja-pode-tramitar-na-camara) à Constituição Federal (PEC), de autoria da deputada federal Erika Hilton (PSol-SP), que propõe jornada de trabalho de, no máximo, 36 horas semanais e quatro dias de trabalho por semana no Brasil.\nSegundo o Stilasp, na próxima audiência no TRT-2, as partes deverão apresentar, no mínimo, duas novas propostas de jornada de trabalho.\nEmpresa\nA PepsiCo disse, em nota, que “cumpre rigorosamente as leis do país e, ainda que em discussão no Congresso, a jornada 6x1 está de acordo com a legislação brasileira em vigor.”\n“A PepsiCo permanece aberta ao diálogo com seus colaboradores e representantes sindicais em busca de soluções equilibradas para todas as partes, reafirmando o seu cuidado e compromisso com as pessoas com base em relações éticas e responsáveis que sempre orientam as suas decisões”, informou.\n[Educação](/educacao)\n[Fies: inscrições para vagas remanescentes do 2º semestre terminam hoje](/educacao/noticia/2024-11/fies-inscricoes-para-vagas-remanescentes-do-2o-semestre-terminam-hoje)\n[Economia](/economia)\n[Dívida Pública sobe 1,8% em outubro e volta a superar R$ 7 trilhões](/economia/noticia/2024-11/divida-publica-sobe-18-em-outubro-e-volta-superar-r-7-trilhoes)\n[Economia](/economia)\n[Mercado frustrado com corte e dúvidas com Trump explicam dólar recorde](/economia/noticia/2024-11/mercado-frustrado-com-corte-e-duvidas-com-trump-explicam-dolar-recorde)",
