    "text": "Read full article Uncrowned 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin scoffs at Logan Paul's $1 million WrestleMania offer: 'That's not my gimmick' drake riggs Uncrowned Thu, May 1, 2025, 12:39 a.m. · 4 min read Link Copied Stone Cold Steve Austin left his mark (literally) on WrestleMania 41. (WWE via Getty Images)\nThere's nothing quite like a \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin appearance at WrestleMania.\n\"The Texas Rattlesnake\" made his presence felt on Night 2 of this year's annual spectacle event. Driving his ATV to the ring, Austin made an unplanned collision with the barricade, then read off the attendance count in Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium and did his famous beer bash celebration. It was a small role in the two-night extravaganza, but could have been bigger, according to recent claims from Logan Paul.\nPaul, who defeated AJ Styles the same night , stated on his \"IMPAULSIVE\" podcast that he pitched an idea for Austin to wear a Prime bottle costume ringside and reveal himself during the match. He claimed Austin rejected the idea, which Austin confirmed Wednesday when speaking on \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\"\n\"If he said that, I'm not going to call him a liar,\" Austin said. \"I just thought that was kind of personal business, but since it's out there, yeah, I turned it down. I'm in the beer business, I sell Broken Skull Beer and we're in about 25 or 30 states. I don't know anything about his product. I don't know about the ingredients in it, if it's good, if it's bad or whatever. So, it just wasn't my thing, so yeah, I turned it down, just because I wasn't into it. And that's no disrespect to him or his product.\n\"It's just — that's not my gimmick. Like I said, he's doing really well. Obviously he's hustling, he's going and getting it, and more power to him. It just wasn't a great fit for Steve Austin.\"\nHad it not been for Austin's second induction into the WWE Hall of Fame as one-half of his famous match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13, the former WWE champion may not have appeared at the 2025 event at all. Instead, we saw the now-infamous ATV blunder, when Austin nearly hurled himself into the front row of the crowd after driving too fast around the ring.\nThankfully, no one was hurt, but Austin is still unhappy with how his brief segment turned out.\n\"[It was a] different throttles setup than what I'm normally used to,\" Austin explained. \"Long story short, just a different throttle system, because I'm pretty damn handy on a four-wheeler.\n\"I was embarrassed about it. I think everybody's OK, but I mean, you go out there on the biggest night in wrestling, and you end up like that, it's not the greatest day at the office. You go out there and you want to give people the best show that you can, and when you fall short of that, it's not great.\"\nRegardless of the chaotic scene, the WWE universe was pleased as always to see the legendary \"Stone Cold.\" Outside of rare instances, Austin hasn't been much of a fixture on WWE programming since his retirement 20 years ago. However, he did make one surprise return to action when he defeated Kevin Owens in WrestleMania 38's Night 1 main event three years ago.\nThe wrestling business has changed significantly since Austin's heyday, and even newcomers like the aforementioned Paul peeling back the curtain is hard for him to deal with. Austin, 60, was at the height of his popularity throughout the \"Attitude Era,\" when wrestling did it's best to blur the lines of fiction and reality. Ideally, that's how it should be, believes Austin.\n\"Man, I'm still a little old school on that,\" Austin said of the art of kayfabe and WWE's new \"WWE: Unreal\" show. \"I'm a big magic fan, but if Harry Houdini is still around, I don't want him to tell me how he does it. I want to figure out how he does it. And if I can't, then I'm going to keep wondering and I'm going to keep watching, but I'm going to keep wondering. So, don't tell me how he's doing it, but let me see if I can figure it out myself. I know it's not 'magic,' it's an illusion, but let me keep wondering about that illusion.\"",

    "text": "Senar monitora 10 mil fazendas em MS e ensina técnicas de prevenção de incêndios Somente no Pantanal, região mais afetada pelo fogo, são quase 115 mil hectares monitoradas Por meio da ATEg (Assistência Técnica e Gerencial do Senar-MS), cerca de dez mil propriedades estão sendo acompanhadas em todo Mato Grosso do Sul, difundindo, além de informações técnicas, práticas de sustentabilidade e prevenção. Só no [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal), local mais afetado pelos incêndios este ano, são quase 115 mil hectares acompanhados pelos técnicos, onde é trabalhado com forte expressão os conceitos de prevenção aos incêndios. As informações são de nota técnica emitida nesta tarde pelo Sistema Famasul (Federação da Agricultura e Pecuária de MS). Adoção de práticas como estações automáticas de risco de fogo, mapas de risco de incêndio nas propriedades, aceiros, queimas prescritas e controladas, Ato Declaratório de Prevenção contra incêndios florestais do Corpo de Bombeiros, e outras práticas, será cada vez mais necessário pelos produtores rurais. As Unidades de Conservação e Terras Indígenas, que são áreas da união, necessitam de mais planos de controle de material combustível. Só neste ano, 34% dessas áreas foram identificadas com focos de calor. Manter os aceiros bem cuidados ao redor das propriedades e das áreas de vegetação são fundamentais para evitar a propagação de incêndios. Realizar o monitoramento contínuo das áreas também auxilia a detectar qualquer sinal de fogo de forma precoce. Brigadas voluntárias Segundo a nota da Famasul, estabelecer e treinar brigadas voluntárias dentro das propriedades rurais para responder rapidamente em caso de emergência e ter um plano de comunicação rápido para alertar as autoridades e vizinhos em caso de avistamento de fumaça ou incêndio são outras ações fundamentais que os produtores podem adotar a fim de auxiliar na preservação do [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal). “As formações de brigadas na área rural, principalmente no [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal), envolve um esforço conjunto de várias entidades, que somam o conhecimento em prevenção e combate, permitindo que haja pessoas para atuar em cada comunidade pensando em casos de incêndios menores”, pontua Clovis Tolentino, consultor técnico do Sistema Famasul. Rede de comunicação por satélite O incremento de ferramentas de comunicação via satélite foi uma grande inovação no [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal), por se tratar de uma região bastante remota, sem redes de celular e energia elétrica. A comunicação é fundamental para acionar as forças de segurança em caso de incêndios, a fim de que estas possam se organizar estrategicamente no combate. \"Outro destaque são as ferramentas de detecção dos incêndios por imagens de satélite. Hoje é possível acompanhar a situação quase que em [tempo](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/tempo) real por meio de várias plataformas. Isso permitiu que as entidades pudessem otimizar os esforços de combate, inclusive com a instalação de 13 bases do Corpo de Bombeiros em locais estratégicos do [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal)\", complementa o profissional. SuperAção [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal) O Senar está com uma ação em andamento neste momento de crise ambiental, o SuperAção [Pantanal](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/pantanal). Mais de 20 profissionais estão no pantanal, visitando as propriedades rurais que sofreram com incêndios florestais neste ano, auxiliando o produtor na tomada de decisão, orientando em relação qual a melhor capacitação, e planejando ações para o combate de incêndios nos próximos anos. O laudo técnico que o produtor rural terá acesso, será de grande utilidade para identificar o prejuízo que houve em 2024 dentro da propriedade dele.",

    "title": "Кто защитит школьников от произвола на ЕГЭ - Мир новостей",
    "text": "В Рособрнадзоре заявили, что в этом году в пунктах сдачи ЕГЭ будут присутствовать родители учеников.\nЭто попытка предотвратить случаи самоуправства администраций учебных заведений при допуске выпускников на экзамены. Но сможет ли родительский контроль повлиять на ситуацию?\nЖалобы на притеснения подростков при сдаче ЕГЭ множатся с каждым годом. Еще несколько лет назад старшеклассники рассказывали об обысках - охрана искала смартфоны и шпаргалки, а в прошлом году речь пошла об унизительных досмотрах. В Воронеже разгорелся настоящий скандал, связанный с издевательствами над школьницами перед ЕГЭ по русскому языку. Педагоги заметили, что на входе в школу №62, где проходил экзамен, происходило частое срабатывание рамки металлоискателя. Особенно часто это происходило при проверке девушек. В итоге выпускницы были вынуждены снимать с себя одежду, включая бюстгальтер, и даже показывать свое нижнее белье охранникам, доказывая, что у них нет ничего запрещенного. Этот случай стал поводом для обсуждения в Госдуме, где глава Минпросвещения России Сергей Кравцов заявил, что сообщения о досмотре школьниц в нижнем белье не соответствуют действительности. В ответ пострадавшие предоставили запись с камер видеонаблюдения, которая начисто опровергала слова министра.\nНесколькими днями позже в татарском поселке Богатые Сабы администрация школы решила бороться с нечестными выпускниками, которые умудряются на ЕГЭ списывать, отпрашиваясь в туалет. Чтобы злостные нарушители не жульничали, «педагоги» укоротили двери туалетов - теперь подросткам они были чуть выше колена. А в школе города Заречного Пензенской области на время проведения ЕГЭ в туалетах попросту сняли двери. По словам учеников, в отхожем месте ни в одной кабинке не было двери, а в помещении находились наблюдатели из городского департамента образования, которые наблюдали, как молодые люди справляют нужду.\nГлава СПЧ Валерий Фадеев назвал эти случаи «унизительными» и «дикими». По его мнению, лучше кто-то спишет на экзамене, чем все пострадают от недостойного обращения, и назвал действия проверяющих варварским самоуправством. Фадеев отметил, что в школах наблюдается крайняя степень недоверия к детям, которая унижает всех: и учеников, и учителей, и самих охранников.\nЧтобы свести такое безобразие к минимуму, в нынешнем году Рособрнадзор разрешил присутствовать на ЕГЭ родителям. Но не всем! «В этом году представители родителей смогут присутствовать в пунктах сдачи ЕГЭ, чтобы следить, соблюдаются ли права выпускников. Как будут отбирать наблюдателей? Есть два главных требования. Первое - пустят представителей родительского комитета только той школы, где будет проходить экзамен, или соседней. Второе - представитель не должен быть родителем или родственником кого-то из детей, сдающих экзамен в этом пункте в этот день», - рассказал на заседании Комитета Совета Федерации по науке, образованию и культуре руководитель Рособрнадзора Анзор Музаев.\nПо его словам, родителям не только доверят проверять соблюдение прав подростков, но и обучат процедуре проведения государственного экзамена. Мамы и папы будут оценивать готовность протоколов проведения экзаменов, исправность работы рамок и металлоискателей, а во время экзамена фиксировать нарушения и заносить их в специальную ведомость для жалоб. Рособрнадзор также планирует запустить чат-бот, с помощью которого выпускники и их родители смогут сообщать о нарушении своих прав.\nМногие эксперты сомневаются в успехе инициативы, утверждая, что она станет очередной формальностью. «В родительские патрули, скорее всего, станут включать людей из активов соседних школ, которые вряд ли заходят портить отношения с местным управлением образования, ведь их детям тоже предстоит сдавать ЕГЭ!» - заявил журналистам самарский учитель Николай Матрушевский.\nМежду тем с 21 марта по 21 апреля около 2 тысяч школьников в 65 регионах страны уже сдали досрочный экзамен под родительским контролем. По словам руководителей Рособрнадзора, экзамены прошли без сбоев. Но связано ли это с появлением чужих родителей в аудиториях, в ведомстве не говорят.\nНаталья Владимирова\nФото: Социальные сети.",

    "text": "Evening Standard Where to find the warmest winter sun in Europe Read full article Laura Hampson and Nuray Bulbul 3 January 2024 at 7:03 pm · 7-min read (Unsplash) Can’t wait until summer?\nLuckily, you don’t have to travel far to enjoy some sun.\nSouthern Europe can offer abundance of sunshine, bright skies, and comfortable (but not tropical) temperatures. Additionally, booking a trip during the off-peak months might result in incredibly reasonable rates for lodging and vehicle rentals, as well as empty beaches and local landmarks.\nBelow, we've picked our favourite spots in Europe that will still give you a sun fix in low season.\nPaphos, Cyprus (Unsplash) Average winter temperature: 18°C\nBest for: Beach hopping and sightseeing.\nCyprus has long been a favourite summer haunt for Brits – one million of us travel there each year (in normal times) – but don’t let that put you off. Riddled with ancient cities and postcard-perfect beaches, it’s the coastal city of Paphos that offers a healthy mix of both. An air of romance fills the city, largely thanks to its association with the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, whose mythical birthplace was the Old Town of Kouklia.\nStay : Kick back and relax at the sleek and modern Annabelle Hotel ( annabelle.com , from about £122/night) in Paphos, situated a short distance from Paphos harbour and surrounded by six acres of tropical gardens.\nValetta, Malta (Pexels) Average winter temperature: 17°C Best for: History buffs and (almost) year-round sunshine.\nThe Med’s most understated gem (and still on our green list), Malta has a lot going for it: 300 days of sunshine per year, prehistoric temples and crystalline waters that are tempting even in the depths of winter. The golden-hued city of Valetta is a Unesco World Heritage Site and further earned its stripes as the European Capital of Culture for 2018 – with its museums, fortresses, and historic churches making it a must-visit.\nStay : For something a little regal, the five-star Xara Palace hotel sits in a stunningly restored 17th century palazzo, hidden away within the walls of the medieval fortified city of Mdina ( xarapalace.com.mt , around £245/night).\nStory continues Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Unsplash) Average winter temperature: 21°C Best for: Both avid adventurers and sun-worshippers.\nFor truly balmy evenings well into winter, the Canary Islands are a failsafe choice, boasting otherworldly landscapes and year-round subtropical temperatures – just remember to pack your one-piece. Lanzarote, a Unesco Geopark since 2015, is made up of more than 300 (largely inactive) volcanic cones, blackened lava fields, and valleys filled with palms – which can all be discovered via the island’s plentiful hiking and cycling trails.\nStay : Sun-worshippers, meanwhile, should check in to the five-star Meliá Salinas ( melia.com , £185/night), which boasts a huge lagoon-like outdoor pool, tropical gardens, tennis courts and access to the white sandy beaches of Costa Teguise.\nSeville, Spain (Pexels) Average winter temperature: 18°C\nBest for: A quieter couples’ city break.\nWith year-round mild temperatures, the sunshine-kissed city of Seville is Spain’s best-kept secret. Smaller and more romantic than its busier counterparts of Barcelona and Valencia, the capital of Spain’s Andalusia region is home to the Alcázar castle complex, built during the Moorish Almohad dynasty and the highly Instagrammable Plaza de España (pictured above).\nStay : Set in a beautiful 17th century building, in the heart of Seville’s Old Town, within walking distance from the cathedral and Museum of Fine Arts, Palacio Bucarelli boasts bright contemporary rooms with a traditional twist, a courtyard, roof terrace, and refreshing plunge pool to cool off in ( palaciobucarelli.com , from around £132/night).\nKarpathos, Greece (Unsplash) Average winter temperature: 17°C\nBest for: Taking it slow in a picturesque setting.\nWhile the Greek islands lie largely dormant in the winter months – many hotels and restaurants shut up shop between November and April – this is also the best time to visit to avoid the crowds. Skip the tourist-centric Cyclades and head east to the Dodecanese, which lie just off the coast of Turkey. Karpathos, the second largest of this group, is the least commercialised, meaning it offers a truly authentic look at the Greek way of life. Villages here are filled with white-washed sugar-cube homes, and the sea is ever sparkling.\nStay: La Scala Luxury Villas is a small family business aimed at providing you with the luxuries that the island can give. Each villa is named after an eccentric Greek musician nestled on the shores of the sparkling Greek sea ( lascalavillas.gr , around £221/night).\nLagos, Portugal Average winter temperature: 17°C\nBest for: People-watching and lazy beach days.\nAs soon as there’s a whiff of summer, swarming to the Algarve is a long-held British pastime, but the Portuguese coastal city of Lagos is arguably even more charming in the winter when the hordes disperse. Head to the coast to see the famous rock formations and golden beaches that decorate your Instagram feed or simply plant yourself in the old town with a pastéis de nata in hand, sitting and watching the world go by.\nStay : Head to the historic old town of Lagos and book a charming room at Casa Mãe for vintage rooms on the 19th century estate, a seasonal farm-to-table Portuguese menu, and all the sunshine surfer vibes ( casa-mae.com , around £340/night).\nSicily, Italy (Unsplash) Average winter temperature: 18°C\nBest for: Foodies and wine lovers.\nCutting a lonesome figure off the coast of Italy, the Mediterranean’s largest island is a treasure trove of delights. The historic sites, like Agrigento's Concordia temple and Selinunte's columns, are considerably less tourist-filled in the winter months and beaches are near empty. Foodies will discover a haven outside of the regular tourist haunts, Noto is home to Café Sicilia and the famous almond granite with brioche buns and you can find the best seafood on the island in Taormina.\nStay: Built in the late 19th century, the Grand Hotel Ortigia lets you breathe in more than 100 years of history with your stay. Every guest who books directly from the website is greeted with a free aperitif on the hotel’s panoramic terrace, surrounded by breathtaking views ( grandhotelortigia.it , around £196/night).\nYou can read our foodie guide to Sicily here .\nCrete, Greece Average winter temperature: 17°C\nBest for: Crystal waters and hiking trails.\nWhile you would be perfectly positioned to plonk yourself on a day bed with a good book, Crete is primed for exploring. With hidden beaches, bijou villages and rugged canyons, it has something for every type of traveller. Adventure seekers should head to Samariá Gorge to hike its six-hour trail, while beach lovers should head south – Elafonisi lagoon with its pink sands and azure-hued waters is a stunning sight.\nStay : Wellness seekers should head for pampering and relaxation at Domes of Elounda ( domesresorts.com , from around £575/night), which is well-known for its glistening views of the mythical island of Spinalonga.\nThe Azores, Portugal (Marek Pelikan / Shutterstock) Average winter temperature: 18°C\nBest for: Thrill-seekers looking for something a little different.\nThis remote archipelago in the mid-Atlantic might seem far-flung, but the five-hour flight is just over an hour longer than it would be to Turkey or Greece. Dramatic landscapes characterise these nine islands – São Miguel has lake-filled calderas and Pico a towering mountain – but it’s the wealth of activities that will appeal to those who visit. The Azores’ whale watching is world-class, as is its diving, hiking, sailing, and canyoning. It’s also largely sustainable, only five per cent of the land here has been developed and marine parks are abundant.\nStay : Treat yourself to a stay in a plush suite or a villa at White Exclusive, which sits on a clifftop on São Miguel island, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean serving up unparalleled views ( whiteazores.com, from around £200/night).\nFethiye, Turkey Average winter temperature: 18°CBest for: Admiring crystal-blue waters without the crowds\nHiking isn't quite as hot as it would be in August, so why not travel part of the 335-mile (540km) Lycian Way and take in some of Turkey's azure seas without the crowds? Between Fethiye and Antalya, the road meanders around countless historic monuments and jaw-dropping cliff faces, including the remains of Levissi, the ancient city of Patara, and the (mostly) submerged city of Simena.Stay: Enjoy a marine club concept stay at Yacht Classic Hotel looking over the beautiful Turkish coast ( yachtclassichotel.com from around £95/night).\nTRENDING Kylie Minogue is stunning in mini dress with surprising accessory and sheer stockings Hello! · 3-min read Only Kendall Jenner would hit the slopes in a mini skirt and stilettos Cosmo · 2-min read What a month without alcohol really does to your body The Telegraph · 6-min read The picture that will make you want to stop drinking The Telegraph · 6-min read How rapid weight loss affects gut health as woman loses 4st in 5 weeks Yahoo Life UK · 4-min read",

El impacto de estas políticas no se hizo esperar en la suba de la canasta de alimentos y necesidades básicas que se incrementó entre un 40 por ciento a un 50 por ciento, la subida de los combustibles en el mismo porcentaje, y ante tanta incertidumbre, el congelamiento de las cadenas de proveedores y suministros”, acotó el texto emitido por dicha organización.",

    "text": "La NBA no solo es baloncesto: los castings, preparaciones y emociones de los 'cheerleaders' La mejor liga de baloncesto del mundo, la NBA, no solo atrae por el nivel de sus jugadores sino también por el espectáculo de los 'Cheerleaders', los encargados de ambientar los partidos. [Sin duda alguna, la NBA es la mejor liga de baloncesto del mundo.](https://sports.caracoltv.com/noticias/nba) El portal 'Mundo Deportivo' se dio a la tarea de hablar con varios protagonistas de los 'Cheerleaders', más precisamente con los de Toronto Raptors, el único equipo canadiense en la NBA. “Es emocionante tener la habilidad de impactar en alguien, de iluminar el día de un fan”, dijo de entrada Dominic Cooper Clarke, líder del grupo llamado The North Side Crew. Este tipo de espectáculo tiene la posibilidad de converger a hombres y mujeres en un solo espacio de alegría. Así lo enmarca Lindsay Aquin, una de las bailarinas. “¡Dios, yo la primera vez que bailé estaba muy nerviosa! Estaba en la pista y sólo miraba y miraba arriba en la grada mientras y no paraba de ver más y más asientos. Estaba en plan ¡Wow! Fue una experiencia que te hace humilde. Es bonito ver cómo los ojos de los rookies se iluminan”, dijo muy emocionada. Publicidad Y es que su labor, la cual hacen con mucha pasión, no solo tiene que ver con el baile, pues también tiene una relación con el aficionado que acude al coliseo o estadio. “Tienes que ser más que un bailarín, nosotros también interactuamos con los fans lanzándoles camisetas. Y los aficionados están muy relajados, tenemos que animarles”, contó Cooper Clarke. Como es de esperarse, todo se trabaja con mucho esfuerzo y Shavar Blackwood, el coreógrafo del grupo, es una parte fundamental. “Yo les recuerdo a los bailarines en cada partido que tienen la oportunidad de mejorar la experiencia de todos los fans.
