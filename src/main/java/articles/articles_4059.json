    "text": "The Institute of Atmosphere and Climate Change of UNAM has alerted that this year will be one of the hottest in the history of Mexico. The prognosis indicates that temperatures could be kept high for several months, affecting various regions of the country. Given this, the Institute recommends that the population be prepared to support extreme heat.\nThe increase in temperatures can generate serious health consequences, from dehydration to severe heat blows. Authorities urge citizens to take precautions to avoid these risks. Among the recommendations are to stay hydrated and avoid direct exposure to the sun during the most intense hours of the day.\nTo deal with heat at home, experts suggest several strategies. Although the use of fans and air conditioning helps lower the temperature, it also increases energy consumption. Therefore, it is advisable to take advantage of cross ventilation, keep the rooms that receive direct sun and place plants that help mitigate heat, such as fern or ‘tiger tongue’.\nThe UNAM anticipates the arrival of four consecutive heat waves, which will begin in the third week of March and could extend until October. The northern states, such as Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California, will be the most affected. These heat waves are a consequence of climate change, driven by the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and poor urban planning.\nSV\nThemes\nRead too\n(tagstotranslate) heat season",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Will Kawira Mwangaza be lucky for third time in Senate after latest ouster? - The Standard",
    "text": "The troubles of Meru Governor Kawira Mwangaza have deepened after MCAs impeached her for the third time in under two years. This is after 49 MCAs out of 69 Ward Reps endorsed a motion by Nominated MCA Zipporah Kinyan to send her packing. The move sets the stage for another battle for survival at the Senate and potentially in the courts. Governor Mwangaza’s impeachment yesterday marked the third successful impeachment by the Assembly after the Meru High Court stopped two impeachment motions. In the motion, Kinya sought to have Mwangaza sent home for alleged gross violation of the Constitution and various national and county laws and abuse of office. Abogeta West MCA Dennis Kiogora said MCAs spent Wednesday night in the Assembly. “We slept on the floor of this Assembly. The people of Meru should know that,” Kiogora, who sponsored a previous impeachment motion, said. There was heavy police presence at the Assembly and its environs as tensions flared ahead of the debate. There was a brief scuffle with security officers as a section of MCAs allied to Mwangaza made their entrance, with the reps accusing the County Assembly of discriminating against them. Speaker Ayub Bundi ruled that despite a pending court case touching on the impeachment, the motion was before the Assembly legally. He said he had written to the Governor to appear before the Assembly to defend herself. “Her Excellency is yet to heed the invitation,” he said. Bundi, a former Abothoguchi Central MCA who served both as Majority and Minority leader, said the Assembly had conducted business legally. He said out of the 69 MCAs, 49 had signed the impeachment motion, thus meeting the one third threshold needed for such a motion. To support the charge of gross misconduct against Mwangaza, Kinya alleged the county boss misled the public that Sh86 million had been raised through the Paybill number 247247 Account Number 0400163917899 established after the murder of Danile Muthiani, alias Sniper, while the correct position is that only Sh286,516 was raised. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Muthiani was a popular blogger who was abducted in Meru in December last year and his body later found in neighbouring Tharaka Nithi. Mwangaza was also accused of illegal appointments and sackings and usurping the Assembly’s functions, including allegedly revoking the appointment of County Public Service Board CEO Virginia Miriti. Mwangaza also faced a charge of failing to appoint heads for Meru County Development and Investment Corporation and Meru Microfinance Corporation. Deputy Speaker Mwenda Ali said Mwangaza had not adhered to recommendations of staffing as she had employed excess staff in her office. “For there to be fairness and to end impunity Mwangaza must go,” said Mwenda. The 17 MCAs who supported Mwangaza defended her, with Kibirichia MCA Jacob Mwirigi, Joshua Mithiaru (Naathu), Ruth Kananu and Kennedy Maingi (Nominated) questioning the validity of the motion. Mwirigi said none of the counts holds water. “There was no qualitative and quantitative public participation. It is ridiculous,” he said. Kananu accused the Assembly of sabotaging development. “They (MCAs) are the people who have sabotaged development in this county, not the Governor,” she said. Mithiaru alleged the impeachment was sponsored by people who want to get rid of Mwangaza and install their proxies.",

    "text": "Photograph by Nathaniel St. Clair\nClimate change is, by far, the biggest story of our era, an existential threat that has already profoundly affected life on Earth and promises to change it even more radically over the next few centuries. As our most pressing problem, it has inspired numerous non-fiction texts—news articles, science journalism, documentaries, academic monographs, and pop-science books (think Greta Thunberg’s The Climate Book or Anri Snaer Magnason’s On Time and Water ).\nIn mainstream fiction, though, climate change took a long time to appear. In 2016, the novelist Amitav Ghosh observed in his book The Great Derangement: Climate Change and The Unthinkable that “it is a striking fact that when novelists do choose to write about climate change, it is almost always outside of fiction.”\nGhosh’s distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction implicitly discounts remarkable early treatments of climate disaster in science fiction—Laurence Manning’s The Man Who Awok e (1933), J.G. Ballard’s The Wind from Nowhere (1962) and The Drowned World (1962), George Turner’s The Sea and Summer (1987), and Octavia E. Butler’s Parable series (1993-1998), to name a few.\nWhat’s more, at least two ‘serious’ novelists have recently tackled the subject: Margaret Atwood in her dystopian MaddAddam series (2003-2013) and Barbara Kingsolver in Flight Behavior (2012). Even so, in 2016, Ghosh’s point largely held true: Climate change was not a hugely popular subject for mainstream literary novelists.\nSince then, however, more stories and novels about climate change have been published and are attracting recognition. Ghosh himself marks the turning point as 2018, a year that saw a wave of extreme climate events, and the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction going to Richard Powers for The Overstory (2018), a book that foregrounds the usually invisible world of trees.\nWhat Is Cli-Fi?\nCli-fi encompasses narratives about climate change. The tag was first coined by journalist and climate activist Dan Bloom , who used it in print in a review of Jim Laughter’s 2012 novella Polar City Red .\nAs the rhyme suggests, cli-fi is a sub-genre of sci-fi. It tends to be speculative, to focus on anthropogenic global warming, and to examine the effects of climate change on human communities. Frequently, as with Atwood’s trilogy, there is a dystopian slant.\nIn keeping with the complexity of climate change itself, cli-fi is multiform, encompassing science fiction, fantasy, mystery, thriller, magical realism, fable, satire, and everything in between.\nSpeculative works set in the future in a world where climate change has already transformed the Earth offer models of possibility and cautionary tales. Bangkok Wakes to Rain (2020) by Pitchaya Sudbanthad takes place in the Thai capital in the late twenty-first century when the city is submerged by the rising sea. American War by Omar el Akkad is set in 2074 when a ban on the sale of fossil fuels ignites a new American Civil War. Similarly, Paolo Bacigalupi’s The Water Knife (2016) imagines a near future in which the Colorado River drying up leads to bloodshed.\nMany books foreground the human cost of climate change rather than explaining its scientific basis. Salvage the Bones (2011) by Jesmyn Ward, for example, describes a family drama in the lead-up to Hurricane Katrina, a storm whose intensity presaged the increasingly destructive storms caused by climate change. How Beautiful We Were (2021) by Imbolo Imbue takes a different approach, showing African villagers standing up to a big American oil company, and The Book of Fire (2023) by Christy Leftieri traces the tragic aftermath of a wildfire in present-day Greece.\nSome novels offer elegiac depictions of climate change’s costs to other species. These include Migrations (2020) and Once There Were Wolves (2021) by Charlotte McConaghy, The Effort (2021) by Claire Holroyde, and Hummingbird Salamander (2021) by Jeff VanderMeer. Science historian Daisy Hildyard privileges nature’s perspective in Emergency (2024), her novel about the interconnectedness of life.\nA growing theme is familiar to many of us: climate anxiety, the psychological toll of waiting for the end of the world as we know it. Weather by Jenny Offill (2020) is centered firmly on the day-to-day life of a Brooklyn woman who must carry out her usual tasks with the threat of climate change always looming in the background.\nWhy We Need Fiction About Climate Change\nIn an interview with author David Thorpe, Dan Bloom pointed out that fiction can express what cold facts can not:\n“We need to go beyond abstract, scientific predictions and government statistics and try to show the cinematic or literary reality of a painful, possible future of the world of climate change. I do believe that cli-fi is a veritable cultural prism, a powerful critical prism that we need to cherish and nurture among our artists and visionary storytellers.”\nIn 2019, climate writer Dominic Hofstetter asked former European commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard what it would take for humanity to get serious about our common plight. Hedegaard’s reply was simple: “We need compelling narratives.”\nBluntly, storytelling is the best way—maybe the only way—to inform, persuade, and inspire people to act. It helps us assimilate facts, contextualize them, and understand and share their meaning. A good story moves us emotionally, allowing us to register its import “in our gut.” As author and story coach Lisa Cron, author of Story or Die , says, “We don’t turn to story to escape reality; we turn to story to navigate reality.”\nAn engaging story is not just persuasive; it also has the potential to build community. A Princeton University study revealed that when a group of people listened to an emotionally engaging story, their brain activity synchronized during the telling—as a group, they imagined the same world and felt the same emotions.\nBarbara Kingsolver, speaking of her book Flight Behavior (2012), explained why fiction, in particular, is valuable as a medium for communicating urgent environmental issues:\n“Fiction has enormous power. It’s funny—people talk about political fiction or apolitical fiction. That’s nonsense. I think all fiction has a point of view, and all fiction has the power to create empathy for the theoretical stranger. It has the power to bring the reader inside the mind of another person. Only fiction can do that.”\nFor author, psychologist, and futurist Dana Klisanin , author of the young-adult novel Future Hack , stories are a way to travel to a different universe:\n“I was an avid reader as a child. Even when I was told to turn off the light and go to sleep, I would grab a flashlight and hide under the bed covers to finish a story. In other words, I was completely absorbed in the world of the book.”\nThis experience, familiar to many of us, is known to scientists as “narrative transportation,” which happens when readers assume the thoughts and feelings of a character and when they mentally simulate a narrative world.\nIn Klisanin’s words:\n“This deep engagement leads to greater absorption and enjoyment and can profoundly impact the reader’s attitudes and behaviors, making the lessons from the story more likely to be internalized. High narrative transportation has also been shown to enhance empathy, supporting understanding and connection with the emotions and experiences of others.”\nConsidering its influence on attitudes and actions, storytelling has the potential to make an outsized impact on things like community engagement, and many governments and organizations are starting to pay attention to this.\nIn 2017, the American Public Health Association (APHA) launched an initiative encouraging people to share personal stories about how climate-related events affected their health and what actions they or their community took to address the situation. The idea was to build a sense of community, resilience, and hope. According to an APHA guide to storytelling:\n“Stories make climate change relatable by drawing on common experience and core human values, like health. Compelling stories generate empathy and understanding. They take listeners on an emotional journey and offer a sense of hope that inspires positive change.”\nVisions of Hope\nThe most important emotion fiction can inspire is a sense of hope, a necessary factor for climate activists working toward the best possible outcomes in the face of impending catastrophe.\nIn an interview with NPR, Imbue says she derived the hopeful aspect of her protagonist Tula from the writing of revolutionary figures like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.:\n“I mean, you have to have a whole different level of hope to believe that you can bring an American oil company to justice, an American oil company that has resources and lawyers and all kinds of powers at its disposal. But Tula does believe that. And that is something that I learned from reading, from looking at their lives.”\nAnother hopeful cli-fi writer is Kim Stanley Robinson, who weaves scientific findings into a compelling narrative. A prime example is his bestselling The Ministry for the Future (2020), which posits a body whose political mission is to advocate for the people of the future. Responding to a description of the work as a utopian novel, he welcomes the judgment:\n“You could probably name the most important utopian novels on the fingers of your hand. …But they get remembered, and they shape people’s conception of what’s possible that could be good in the future.”\nKlisanin has a similarly positive yet realistic view. Her novel Future Hack features young characters who face climate-related problems with boundless energy and a problem-solving spirit. Her intention is to reassure and inspire confidence. Klisanin wrote:\n“I hope that Future Hack will inspire readers with a sense of hope and possibility for the future and embolden them to take action to protect the environment and endangered species. As the series unfolds, I also aim to help readers struggling with eco-anxiety by showing them that they are not alone and by introducing them to some coping methods.”\nThe climate crisis has not yet generated a single written work as powerful as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) was in mobilizing mid-twentieth-century audiences against DDT and other toxic chemicals. But we can at least be cheered by the number of talented writers who, in varied ways and multiple genres, are working to produce such a story.\nThis article was produced by Earth | Food | Life , a project of the Independent Media Institute.\nKatherine Dolan is a writer, editor, and researcher at the Independent Media Institute from Dunedin, New Zealand.

    "title": "Avocats et mangues au Maroc : record de croissance malgré les défis",
    "text": "Au Maroc, les cultivateurs d’avocats annoncent une récolte exceptionnelle malgré la sécheresse qui a touché le pays dans sa partie nord-ouest. La production pour la saison, allant d’octobre (exceptionnel) à avril, pourrait enregistrer une hausse de 2%. Bien que cette nouvelle soit positive pour les consommateurs, elle pourrait avoir des implications sur la qualité de ce fruit crémeux, très prisé par les restaurateurs.\nLes conditions climatiques au Maroc se sont révélées idéales pour les producteurs d’avocats, contribuant à une augmentation constante des exportations en raison de la popularité croissante de ce fruit et de la hausse des prix sur le marché international. Le Maroc est devenu un acteur majeur sur la scène mondiale de l’avocat depuis son introduction.\nLes régions du nord du Maroc, qui bénéficient de précipitations et de réserves d’eau substantielles, ont joué un rôle clé dans la croissance de la production agricole de l’avocat, contrairement aux régions du sud, comme Agadir et le Sahara, confrontées à des pénuries d’eau. Bien que le Maroc souffre de graves sécheresses depuis cinq ans, l’industrie de l’avocat a fait preuve de résilience et se porte très bien.\nMalgré les défis liés à la pénurie d’eau, les producteurs d’avocats ont réussi à accroître leur production. Toutefois, il est souligné l’importance de réglementer les exploitations agricoles pour éviter des déséquilibres dans la distribution de l’eau.\nLa récolte d’avocats pour cette saison pourrait atteindre 60 000 tonnes à l’échelle nationale, selon l’Association marocaine des exportateurs d’avocats. Cependant, la concurrence accrue sur les marchés internationaux, combinée à des fruits plus petits cette année, a entraîné des difficultés pour les exportateurs, avec deux tiers de la récolte actuelle sans destination fixe.\nDu coup, les exportateurs font également face à des défis liés à la taille réduite de leurs fruits et à la compétition accrue sur les marchés internationaux, notamment en Europe, principal marché d’exportation de fruits et légumes du Maroc. Les risques d’accumulation de grandes quantités d’avocats non exportés pourraient entraîner une baisse des prix et des conséquences néfastes à l’interne pour cette industrie, au bonheur des consommateurs locaux.\nMalgré les défis liés à la pénurie d’eau, les exportations marocaines d’avocats sont en croissance. Le Maroc, qui était le 12e exportateur mondial d’avocats en 2017, a grimpé au neuvième rang l’année dernière, avec plus de 55 000 tonnes exportées. Les performances des neuf premiers mois de 2023 indiquent que les exportations de ce fruit connaissent la croissance la plus rapide, malgré les difficultés rencontrées par les producteurs en raison de la pénurie de ressources en eau.\nLe défi de l’utilisation efficace de l’eau reste crucial pour l’avenir de la production d’avocats au Maroc, et des appels sont régulièrement lancés pour limiter la consommation d’eau des producteurs tout en explorant des technologies modernes pour préserver les ressources naturelles et maintenir un revenu stable grâce aux exportations de ce produit prisé à l’échelle mondiale.\nA l’inverse, les importations marocaines d’avocats devraient atteindre un niveau record cette année, malgré une production locale robuste qui a hissé le Maroc à la neuvième place des exportateurs mondiaux d’avocats à fin 2022. Au cours des neuf premiers mois de l’année en cours, le Maroc a importé 13 500 tonnes d’avocats, marquant ainsi la plus grande quantité importée au cours des huit dernières années. La valeur totale de ces importations s’élève à 8,5 millions de dollars, constituant également un record pour la période.\nPlusieurs facteurs contribuent à cette augmentation des importations. L’importation d’avocats au Maroc, qui s’étend de mars à septembre, comble le déficit d’offre locale pendant cette période. De plus, l’importation d’avocats au Maroc est liée à la performance de l’industrie touristique du pays. Il est dit qu’en 2023, le Maroc accueillera un nombre record de touristes, stimulant ainsi les importations de divers produits, dont les avocats.\nCela dit, le Pérou, deuxième exportateur mondial d’avocats après le Mexique, demeure le principal fournisseur du Maroc, représentant au moins les deux tiers des importations totales d’avocats chaque année. Au cours des neuf premiers mois de 2023, les avocats péruviens ont constitué 78% du volume total importé par le Maroc. Bien que les avocats espagnols soient également importés, leur part de marché a diminué, passant de plus de 30% des importations marocaines en 2019 à seulement 12% à fin septembre 2023. D’autres pays, dont l’Afrique du Sud, le Brésil et le Kenya, contribuent par ailleurs aux importations marocaines d’avocats.\nC’est aussi le cas des importations de mangues au Maroc. Elles ont connu une croissance spectaculaire ces dernières années, avec une explosion des chiffres selon EastFruit. Les consommateurs marocains affichent un engouement croissant pour les mangues, et le pays s’apprête à surpasser son propre record d’importation cette année. Depuis 2017, les importations de mangues ont doublé, atteignant presque le niveau total de l’année précédente au cours des neuf premiers mois de 2023.\nEntre 2017 et 2022, les importations de mangues au Maroc ont augmenté en moyenne de 15 % par an, se situant juste derrière la Chine, la Jordanie et Brunei, qui ont connu des augmentations de 30 %, 66 % et 39 %, respectivement. En comparaison, les États-Unis, les Pays-Bas et l’Allemagne, principaux acheteurs mondiaux avec la Chine, ont augmenté leurs importations de seulement 4 %, 6 % et 1 %, respectivement.\nLes principales sources d’importation de mangues au Maroc proviennent d’Afrique subsaharienne et de fournisseurs notables tels que le Pérou, le Brésil, l’Espagne et, tout récemment, l’Égypte.",
