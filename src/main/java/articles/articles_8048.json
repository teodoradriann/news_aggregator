    "text": "Sociedad El Papa no acudirá a los actos religiosos del fin de semana EFE - martes, 18 de febrero de 2025 Francisco continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito para la infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que sufre El Papa no acudirá a los actos religiosos del fin de semana - Foto: Guglielmo Mangiapane El Papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.Los partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del Papa es \"complejo\", por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio\", que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.A pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.Por el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\"El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables\", se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.Previamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia\" de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.El Vaticano añadió que el \"cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada\", lo que hace prever que el Papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.

    "text": "In response to the approaching Tropical Cyclone Alfred, Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said: \"Communities in northern NSW and SE Queensland experiencing back to back disasters are asking why? It is critical that Australians know that Cyclone Alfred, like so many other extremes across Australia, is more intense and destructive due to climate change. This is essential to assisting communities and emergency services to prepare for disasters.\"\nThe Climate Council has released the following statement to clarify how climate change has made this cyclone more damaging than it would otherwise be.\nMedia can attribute the following to Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie.\nCyclone Alfred more intense and destructive due to climate change\nPublished 6 March 2025\nCommunities in Queensland and northern NSW are bracing for the destructive force of the wind, rain and storm surges from Cyclone Alfred. It is currently moving towards the southeast Queensland coast and is expected to remain as a category 2 tropical cyclone until it crosses the coast.\nIt is critical that we understand that such disasters are no longer simply \"natural\". Climate pollution has made Cyclone Alfred more intense and destructive.\nIt is vital that communities, emergency services, media and governments understand this to ensure that we can both tackle the root cause - pollution from coal, oil and gas - as well as prepare for more destructive disasters into the future.\nThere are several ways that climate change is influencing Tropical Cyclone Alfred:\nClimate change has made our oceans hotter which is driving more ferocious and destructive cyclones.\nHotter conditions provide more fuel for extreme winds, intense rainfall and larger storms. Around the world maximum wind speeds are\ngetting strongerfor cyclones.The oceans on the east coast have been exceptionally hot. Sea surface temperatures were the warmest\non recordfor each month between October 2024 and February 2025.\nThe risk of flooding damage from Tropical Cyclone Alfred is greater due to climate change.\nOne of the deadliest aspects of a cyclone is when a storm pushes ocean water onto land, called a storm surge. Sea levels around Australia have\n[risen 20cm]due to climate change and so a storm surge now rides on much higher seas. The storm surge during Cyclone Alfred will be higher, and go further onto land, as a consequence of climate change.A hotter world is a wetter world due to more evaporation. Climate change is driving more extreme rainfall, including during cyclones. Some areas in northern NSW and southeast Queensland could experience\n[40%]of Brisbane'sannual rainfallin 24 hours.There is evidence that tropical cyclones are moving more slowly across the ocean and land. That means they can linger longer over communities and dump immense amounts of rain over a small area, while also sustaining damaging windspeeds for a longer period.\nHeavy rainfall and a storm surge together exacerbates flooding, which is a major risk right now for communities in southeast Queensland and northern NSW.\nCyclone Alfred is tracking further south than cyclones usually do in Australia.\nTropical cyclones normally occur in the tropics. Southern communities have rarely had to face or prepare for these sorts of events. Many homes and infrastructure in South East Queensland are not built to withstand cyclones and the destructive winds they bring.\n[Scientists]are concerned that as our oceans heat up cyclones may track further south on the east coast.\nClimate pollution is driving more ferocious and costly extreme weather events. While Australia is now cutting pollution, but it is not fast or far enough. We must slash climate pollution to prevent the problem from getting worse, as well as prepare communities and our infrastructure for the disasters we cannot avoid.",

    "text": "BENGALURU: In ancient times, the deep resonant sound of a conch, or shankha was heard at the beginning of an approaching battle. Imagine the same sound with an ensemble of orchestra and Carnatic music and you will find yourself in the midst of a cultural spectacle known as Sparks Mahabharata Opera Project - Mantras, Fights and Threnody, a unique musical production by the city-based Attakkalari Centre of Movement Arts in collaboration with Alain Daniélou Foundation, Kama Productions, Ensemble MusikFabrik and Fattore K, along with the support of Consolato Generale d’Italia Bangalore, the Goethe-Institut, and Unione Induista Italiana.\nThe world premiere of the show will be staged at Ranga Shankara on January 23 after which it will go on an extensive European tour.\nThe 70-minute production was originally conceptualised by Italian composer Riccardo Nova in 2014, where he envisioned the interpretation of selected sections of Mahabharata with the composition of an operatic work constructed around Indian traditional musicians and singers, string orchestra and natural horns as a narrator sings the slokas, namely the Sanskrit verses with their archaic rhythms.\n“I picked the Mahabharata, mainly because of the Sanskrit language which retains, unlike all the modern languages, a fairly refined structure and the long and short syllables which are absent from modern languages. From a musical point of view, it works as an inspirational guide. The soundscape itself has an archaic rhythm so I wanted to use this language and the lyrics from the Mahabharata itself,” says Nova. Varijashree Venugopal is on the vocals with BC Manjunath on Mridangam and Guru Prasanna on Khanjira.\nDirector Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, who is well-known for his theatre productions in Italy, had always been familiar with Mahabharata’s story, “When I heard Riccardo was working on Mahabharata, I wanted to be a part of it so we started to organise the project.We felt like we had started to make a good meal with different flavours,” says Corsetti.\nJayachandran Palazhy, artistic director of Attakkalari Centre of Movement and Arts who is also the choreographer of the show, came in contact with Nova in 2018 in Rome when he became involved in the project. What fascinated him was when he saw Nova’s rudra mantra which is a particular chant in the show. “The words are so poetic and rhythmic. We have Indian and Italian dancers, martial artistes and acrobats, so all this has come together, it’s an amalgamation of ideas and movement,” says Palazhy, adding, “This is just a preview for us to see for ourselves how this has all come together.”\nThe idea of the work and discovering something new keeps them going despite the challenges. “It’s about looking at the world today from the prism of the Mahabharata and not the other way around. The production delves into three deaths – that of Karna who was noble but gets killed in a devious way; of Abhimanyu, who is a young boy committed to his family and jumps into war; and finally the death of Bhisma, who taught everyone and doesn’t want to fight but he still dies,” explains Palazhy.\nWhile this particular production has taken up only selected mantras and sections from the Mahabharata like Abhimanyu jumping into the chakravyuh, Nova is also planning to create more acts in the future.",

    "text": "Well, [life ](https://www.britannica.com/science/life)is an open book where you write your own story. It is our story that we write with our unique plot twists and character development. As it is our story, we need to grab the pen and write the script on our own without forgetting that the one who controls your story is none other than yourself. After all, it is the authenticity of your story that makes it uniquely yours. Life is just like a cricket match Life is as complex as a [cricket match](https://www.britannica.com/sports/cricket-sport). Just imagine your life as a huge cricket stadium and you are the only batsman, with no wickets to make you lose, and no other players to catch your ball… it’s not fun, right? The balls that come to you are just like the opportunities and obstacles which often come and go around with time. Similarly, rejections and failure are challenges which you face in life. At times you might keep hitting six no matter how many times the ball was thrown out of reach. And, at times you may not even be able to hit four no matter how easy the ball was. Life is simple and complicated at the same time. It is up to you how you will think about it and how you overcome your thoughts about it. After every sunset, there comes a new morning. Likewise, after every struggle and hard work, there comes a beautiful success. At times you will find people who tend to demotivate you or try to pull you and distract you. However, the overall solution to this might be just ignoring them and just staying focused on your journey. Every human being has their goals to reach in life and everyone has their own story to write. Frustration, irritation, voices in our head and sadness are the parts of our lives, which should not be avoided. The reason is that they are essential to make you strong enough to handle various situations and conditions in future. Savour the good and learn from the bad We all have one life to live where there are dreams, hopes and expectations to come true. It is all based on the trial and error theory. The more mistakes you make, the more lessons you learn. And, with all those lessons you learn there, you meet a better version of yourself. You will not reach the top until and unless you are pricked by the thorns at the bottom. The pain you have felt, the hunger that hurts and those eyes with sleepless nights will put you at that place where you will get everything you deserve. The results you want to see might take time, but giving up is never an option. Bad days are followed by amazing and bright days, you just need to have patience, trust and courage to just keep going no matter what happens. Sometimes, you stumble upon a clearing where everything makes sense, and the sun shines brighter. Other times, you are navigating through thick undergrowth, unsure of where you are headed. Life has its share of laughter and tears, and it’s perfectly normal to feel lost at times. The point here is to savour the good moments, learn from the not-so-good ones, and keep simple pleasures, surround yourself with people who make the journey worthwhile. [Life](https://english.onlinekhabar.com/life-is-it-a-stage.html) is a story we are all writing, filled with plot twists and character development. So, grab your metaphorical pen and write your tale with courage, kindness, and a dash of humour, creating your own unique story.",
