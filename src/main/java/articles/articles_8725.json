    "text": "Police, firefighters and paramedics from Palatine responded about 10:00 p.m., Friday, July 11, 2025 to a report of a multi-vehicle crash near Dundee Road and Kennedy Road (just west of Route 53) that resulted in multiple injuries.\nUpon arrival, police officers, firefighters and paramedics located multiple severely damaged vehicles, including a black Lexus that had collided head-on with a black Nissan. A 23-year-old female passenger from the Nissan, along with her two children — a 7-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl — were transported to area hospitals with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. One of the patients was transported to Level 1 Trauma Center Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge.\nFour ambulances were assigned to the crash, and the incident was upgraded to an entrapment response because at least one victim was reported to be under a vehicle. The patient was extricated by 10:20 p.m.\nA rescue ambulance crew from Arlington Heights Fire Department assisted Palatine firefighters and paramedics.\nPreliminary investigation revealed that the driver of the Lexus, Rosalba Ramirez-Fraga, 31, of the 200 block of North Coach Road in Wheeling, was traveling northbound on North Frontage Road when she rear-ended a gray Toyota. Ramirez-Fraga then continued into the westbound lanes of Dundee Road while driving eastbound, where she struck the Nissan head-on.\nOfficers observed signs of impairment with the driver of the Lexus, and Ramirez-Fraga admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash. Several open containers of alcohol were also recovered from her vehicle.\nRamirez-Fraga was arrested and charged with the following offenses:\nAggravated DUI (Alcohol) – Great Bodily Harm (Class 4 Felony)\nAggravated DUI (Alcohol) – No Valid Insurance (Class 4 Felony)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol (Class A Misdemeanor)\nNo Valid Driver’s License (Class B Misdemeanor)\nFailure to Reduce Speed to Avoid a Collision (Petty Offense)\nIllegal Transportation of Open Alcohol – Driver (Petty Offense)\nThere was additional court business and there were other petty offenses related to the traffic crashes, according to the Palatine Police Department.\nRamirez-Fraga appeared in court on Wednesday, July 16, 2025 and was ordered to remain in custody until her next court date, scheduled for August 8, 2025, at 9:00 AM in Room 108 of the Cook County 3rd District Courthouse in Rolling Meadows.\nDEVELOPING IF CONTENT IS AVAILABLE …\nStay informed with news from The Cardinal’s Emergencies Behind the Scenes Facebook page — Facebook.com/CardinalEmergencies.

    "text": "Troops of Operation Safe Haven, a multi-security task force maintaining peace in Plateau and parts of Bauchi and Kaduna states, have arrested the suspected killers of a traditional ruler in Kaduna State. Saleh Umar, the Ardo of Kamuru of Dutsen Bako village in Zango Kataf Local Government Area, was kidnapped and killed on 27 February, after the kidnappers collected a ransom of two million naira. The arrested suspects were identified as Bokolo Mohammed, Shuaibu Mohammed and Abdulkareem Suleiman. The troops also arrested the suspected killers of a retired Nigerian Air Force Master Warrant Officer (MWO), Hamza Musa, who was also killed in Dutsen Bako village. Mr Musa’s suspected killers are his sons – Timothy Musa and Yaro Musa, and his cousin, Samson Moses. Parading the suspects at the headquarters of the operation in Jos, Samson Zhakom, an army major and spokesperson of the operation, said the suspects were arrested after concerted efforts by security agents. He said the troops also arrested the suspected killer of a 55-year-old man, Istifanus Musa, who was killed in Bokkos Local Government Area of Plateau State. Mr Zhakom said “Another significant development, Operation SAFE HAVEN in collaboration with the tactical team of the Department of State Services (DSS) Plateau State Command acting on human intelligence raided an identified railway vandals/economic saboteurs’ hideout around NEPA area in Jos North LGA of Plateau State and recovered vandalised metallic railway slippers. “We remain grateful to the general public, especially individuals who volunteered information leading to these successes crucial at averting reprisal attacks in the case for the murdered Ardo. We enjoin you all not to relent in furnishing security agencies with relevant information that could aid operations and provide an enabling environment for enhanced security and economic development,” the spokesperson added. READ ALSO: [Insecurity, killings may trigger scarcity of husbands in South-east – Commission] One of the suspects, Mr Muhammad, admitted to having taken part in the murder of the traditional ruler in Kaduna State. “We kidnapped him on the road. After we had taken him to the den and the ransom was paid, we then realised that he could identify one of us. We then decided to kill him, and so we killed him,” the suspect said.

Their strategic focus suggests a shift towards AI-centric educational methods, possibly reshaping teaching practices worldwide.

    "text": "Presidente electo de Panamá advierte a las eléctricas: &quot;El país está colmado&quot; por apagones Ciudad de Panamá, 6 jun (EFE).- El presidente electo de Panamá, José Raúl Mulino, quien asumirá el cargo el 1 de julio próximo, dijo este jueves que &quot;el país entero está colmado&quot; por los constantes apagones, y prometió medidas para &quot;poner orden&quot; y que concesionarias del Estado que distribuyen la electricidad ofrezcan un buen servicio. &quot;Yo creo que ya está bueno&quot;, dijo Mulino a periodistas, tras asegurar que &quot;el país entero está colmado de ese problema, está altamente cansado de los apagones a nivel nacional, en todo sentido&quot;. El gobernante electo, que ha sufrido por este asunto y lo ha denunciado durante años, con constantes apagones en su finca y en su casa de playa tanto los fines de semana como durante la semana, dijo que el servicio &quot;se va por horas, hasta 27 horas seguidas sin luz&quot; han estado en Antón, una localidad playera cercana a la Ciudad de Panamá. Pero esta situación de falta de fluido eléctrico constante también la está padeciendo el gobernante electo de un tiempo para acá en su residencia en la capital, según explicó. &quot;¿Ustedes saben a qué hora vino la luz ayer en Altos del Golf?&quot;, la acomodada barriada capitalina donde reside, &quot;cerca de las 9 de la noche, desde las 5 de la tarde&quot; se había ido, comentó el jefe de Estado electo, que ayer en su cuenta de X afirmó al respeto que en los &quot;24 años&quot; que tiene viviendo allí &quot;jamás&quot; se habían dado apagones pero que ahora ocurren &quot;semanalmente&quot; y por &quot;muchas horas&quot;. Ante esta situación, Mulino ya instruyó al personal designado en la Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos (Asep) &quot;de que una de las primeras acciones es comenzar a poner orden en todas estas empresas que tienen un servicio público, que recuerden que ellos son concesionarios del Estado, y el Estado somos los panameños&quot;. En Panamá hay tres distribuidoras de electricidad: Ensa, Naturgy y Edechi. El mal servicio eléctrico es un problema reclamado durante años por los habitantes de Panamá, que tienen que soportar además el alto costo de la tarifa. Este año se han dado varias protestas públicas, entre ellas algunas donde los usuarios lanzaron a las puertas de las empresas eléctricas sus electrodomésticos dañados por los apagones. Un fallo en el sistema eléctrico dejó durante horas sin luz ni agua a casi todo el país antes de la Nochebuena, lo que generó una lluvia de quejas y críticas en las redes sociales. Sobre la tarifa eléctrica, Mulino afirmó: &quot;Se va a revisar todo y haremos todo lo que tengan que hacerse para que la tarifa eléctrica no impacte&quot; a los consumidores. (c) Agencia EFE",
