    "text": "Manifestó que su compromiso actual es con las víctimas, cuyo dolor espera mitigar y para lo cual, según añadió, va a hablar con el gobierno de Venezuela para repatriar los restos de los asesinados durante el conflicto armado y enterrados en fosas comunes en ese país.\n“Hemos solicitado permiso al gobierno del presidente [Nicolás] Maduro para poder llegar a Venezuela y recuperar los restos de víctimas que durante el conflicto armado tuvimos responsabilidad y están en territorio venezolano, tanto al pueblo colombiano como al venezolano, especialmente al de frontera le debo un pedido de perdón”, refirió.\nAseguró que su trabajo como gestor de paz empieza desde esta misma jornada, la siguiente a su liberación.\nTambién invitó al expresidente Álvaro Uribe (2002-2010) a avanzar para hacer las paces.\n“No vengo a tomar retaliaciones o venganzas. En el pasado fuimos aliados, no puedo ocultarlo y hoy lo invito para que seamos aliados”, apuntó en referencia al exmandatario.\nMancuso fue liberado de la cárcel de La Picota gracias a una orden conferida por la Sala de Justicia y Paz del Tribunal Superior de Bogotá.\nDicha corte derogó las 57 órdenes de captura que tenía en su contra el excomandante de las Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), y que ahora serán reemplazadas por unas nuevas que no implican la privación de la libertad.\nEl exparamilitar, al que se le imputan unos siete mil 500 crímenes, estuvo preso por casi 20 años primero en Colombia y después en Estados Unidos, nación a la que fue extraditado y en la que cumplió una condena por narcotráfico.\nRegresó a su país natal el pasado 27 de febrero, después de haber sido designado como gestor de paz por el presidente Gustavo Petro, para ayudar a esclarecer los vínculos que unían a los altos mandos del país con los paramilitares a finales del siglo pasado.\nEn una entrevista divulgada el pasado 12 de junio, Mancuso reafirmó sus afirmaciones de que el expresidente Álvaro Uribe, cuando era gobernador de Antioquia (noroeste), estuvo al tanto de la masacre de El Aro, cometida el 22 de octubre de 1997 por paramilitares del Bloque Mineros de las AUC y en la cual perdieron la vida unos 17 campesinos.\narc/ifs",

    "text": "Russian forces, under the guise of promoting patriotism, continue a large-scale recruitment campaign targeting youth in the occupied territories of Ukraine, reports the National Resistance Center (NRC). The enemy is creating a network of various patriotic organizations. Recently, a new branch of the so-called \"Molodaya gvardiya\" was opened in the village of Vesele in the Zaporizhzhia region. The National Resistance Center (NRC) emphasized that these organizations present themselves as platforms for self-realization, leadership development, and patriotic education. \"Youth are involved in various propaganda activities and, eventually, in military training. They are promised the chance to change the world,\" the report stated. However, in reality, young people become mere tools in the hands of Russian forces. These programs are aimed at recruiting cannon fodder for future Kremlin wars. The NRC urged reporting on the organizers of such projects and instances of recruitment of teenagers into these camps. \"Every crime must not go unpunished,\" concluded the National Resistance Center.",
