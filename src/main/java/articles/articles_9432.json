    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Gurugram, Aug 9 (IANS) The Gurugram Police have filed a case against eight flat owners of a residential society who accommodated 16 foreign nationals in their flats without informing the police and without the necessary documentation.\nAccording to police, in the past week, a total of 34 cases have been registered against those who disobeyed the instructions to accommodate foreign nationals.\nApart from this, the police on Thursday issued some guidelines and orders to ensure law and order in view of Independence Day. All parking contractors have been instructed to check all vehicles thoroughly before getting them parked.\nSimilarly, all malls and other important building owners have been asked to install CCTV cameras at the entry and exit gates and also ensure that the cameras are working properly so that suspicious activities can be monitored.\nCCTV cameras should be installed at the reception place based on prescribed parameters so that all the persons making inquiries can be easily identified. Apart from this, surveillance cameras should also be installed inside these buildings at appropriate places like underground parking, generators power control rooms.\nPolice have asked bus drivers and conductors to park buses under their supervision, keep a strict watch on the bus and immediately inform the police through any medium in case of any suspicious situation.\nAccording to the guidelines, every mall management and industry owner should appoint security guards at their place and get their character and criminal record verified. Also, instruct the security guards to immediately inform the police station about any suspicious person.\nMobile phone and SIM card sellers should issue mobile phone connections only after proper identification and verification of identity documents, police said.\nGuest house, hotel, and restaurant owners should keep complete details of the people staying at their place and maintain their complete records. Along with this, police verification of the employees working in guest houses hotels, restaurants, and resorts should also be done.\nCyber ​​cafe owners and managers should immediately inform police about any person making suspicious calls or sending e-mails from their place, the police said, adding that they should keep complete details of the people coming and going to the cyber cafe and maintain the record.\nPolice have asked agencies operating microlights, aircraft, gliders, power gliders, and hand-it-air balloons to verify employees working at their place and use all means of security.\nAll vehicle dealers must keep the identity card of all the customers buying and selling vehicles from them in their records.\nThe Gurugram Police have formed various teams to ensure compliance with these orders and instructions, which are conducting regular investigations.\n\"The Gurugram Police also appeals to the general public that if you sense any suspicious person, vehicle, object or place, then you must inform the police through any medium so that law and order and peace can be maintained and your safety is ensured,\" Arpit Jain, DCP (headquarters) said.\nMENAFN08082024000231011071ID1108534190",

    "title": "Hillsong founder Brian Houston says X account was hacked after ‘ladies and girls kissing’ post",
    "text": "The founder and former leader of Hillsong Church, Brian Houston, has said his X account was hacked after his account posted the words “ladies and girls kissing”. According to Relevant Magazine, the post appeared on Tuesday 11:41pm AEDT and was deleted after 16 minutes. It reportedly garnered speculation from social media users who wondered if he was searching for those words online, or if he was hacked. On Friday at 4:02am GMT, Houston reposted a statement posted on X by one of his assistants which told people to ignore any posts from him that seem unusual. The statement read: “Hello Everyone. Thank you for your concern, Ps Brian’s assistant here! Rest assured we are working on discovering how Ps Brian was hacked. Our team has ascertained that someone has logged into his account from a location in the USA. We’ve changed his password, so here’s hoping they no longer have access. Please disregard anything that seems out of the normal. For your safety remember Pastor Brian does not contact anyone privately. Thank you!” Houston, who resigned from Hillsong in 2021, has in his past been accused of inappropriate behaviour toward two women, which the Church apologised for in 2022. In the first instance, Houston was accused of sending inappropriate text messages which led to the woman who received them resigning. The second incident saw Houston enter the hotel room of a woman during the Church's annual conference in 2019 but Hillsong's investigation was not able to confirm exactly what happened. Meanwhile, last April, Houston was fined and sentenced to three years' probation for driving under the influence of alcohol while in the US. In August 2023, Houston was acquitted of failing not to report historical abuse allegations against his father. An Australian court ruled that he had a \"reasonable excuse\" under the law not to disclose the information. Last December, Houston announced he will be starting a new online ministry and church.",

    "text": "News industry off to brutal 2024 start as mass layoffs devastate publishers, raising questions about the future of journalism By Oliver Darcy and Jon Passantino, CNN (CNN) — The news industry is enduring a brutal start to the new year, with outlets large and small across the country hemorrhaging reporting staff as legacy business models that kept much of the industry afloat for decades collapse in plain sight. The rapid contraction, coming even as the presidential election cycle heats up and public attention and revenues historically mount, has been on full display this month, with the first few weeks of 2024 ushering in a spate of painful layoffs at news organizations from coast-to-coast. The Los Angeles Times slashed its newsroom by more than 20% earlier this week; TIME cut dozens of staffers; and Business Insider said it would trim its workforce by 8%. Meanwhile, hundreds of staffers at Condé Nast, Forbes, The New York Daily News, and others staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts at the outlets. The recent round of layoffs, while pronounced, are part of a much larger and unrelenting storm battering the journalism industry. Over the past 18 months, most news organizations have been forced to make difficult decisions to reduce their workforces. At the national level, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Vice Media, Sports Illustrated, Vox Media, NBC News, CNBC, and other organizations have cut swaths of their reporting staff. At the local level, layoffs have been nearly constant, with newspaper giant Gannett cutting hundreds of employees, and small outlets carving out already lean operations. The latest round of layoffs come after 2023 marked the worst year for job cuts in the journalism sector since Covid-19 upended the world in 2020, with roughly 2,700 jobs eliminated. While each outlet is struggling with its own unique challenges, they all are facing brutal industry headwinds ushered in by the internet revolution and other technological advances that have fundamentally changed the way the public consumes news and entertainment. Audiences that once reliably surfed traditional cable channels and consumed news websites or newspapers are instead absorbing content and spending time on platforms such as TikTok and Netflix, leading to massive declines in ratings and traffic. That shift in behavior has led brands to spend their marketing in emerging digital arenas, particularly given their ability to offer advertisers powerful tools to target audiences with precision. Making matters worse, news outlets have seen their online advertising businesses vanish as social media and search giants devour much of the industry’s dollars. Research produced by Columbia University in October estimated that technology titans Google and Meta should pay news outlets $14 billion per year in revenue for their search traffic and content, a figure it [described](https://policydialogue.org/files/publications/papers/USE-THIS-2023.10.28_Paying-for-News_Clean-2.pdf) as “conservative.” But technology companies have resisted paying publishers for their content and launched high-profile fights to block legislation intended to recoup some of the lost revenue. “The ad industry doesn’t need the news industry when there are so many other ways to purchase attention, and so many better ways to target users,” Jay Rosen, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, told CNN. The change in behavior has also meant news consumers are canceling subscriptions to newspapers and cable providers, cutting precious revenues even further. “I am sorry to say that I do not see turning around most legacy outlets,” Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, told CNN. “Their proprietors, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the internet. They held onto their old business models — advertising, subscription, and the attention economy.” “Many of them are now controlled by hedge funds, which will not invest or innovate,” Jarvis said, adding that cost-cutting is the “predictable response to a worsening downward business spiral,” which “will make the products of these publications only worse, which will accelerate the spiral.” “The death of newspapers — and magazines and linear TV — has been oft-foretold and has not yet occurred,” Jarvis said. “The fall might be coming now.” The hollowing out of large news institutions comes at a perilous time for America. Antidemocratic candidates have intentionally worked to undermine faith in news outlets as they look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast, attacking those tasked with the duty of holding public officials accountable. “To say that trust in the news media has declined is correct, but too vague,” Rosen said. “The reality is that destroying confidence in the practice and products of journalism is a potent and successful political strategy, as with Steve Bannon’s ‘flood the zone.’” That lack of accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the ballot box. Margaret Sullivan, a columnist at The Guardian who previously wrote about media for The Washington Post and The New York Times, told CNN in December that she is worried about the larger consequences the deeper cuts in the news business will have on the country. Sullivan said that it is not only “heartbreaking to see the loss of these jobs,” but warned the action will do “damage to society.” “The loss of journalists contributes to the exponential growth of news deserts in large swaths of the nation — and that’s disastrous when misinformation is rampant,” Sullivan said. “Democracy needs an informed electorate in order to function and that is tragically dwindling in many regions.” For a time, there had been hope that billionaire ownership of news publications could offer stability to the industry as it wears off legacy business models. Recent months, however, have cast doubt on that optimism, with Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times making significant cuts to their newsrooms. But despite the widespread gloom, there are some encouraging signs popping up across the industry. Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, noted some local news outlets have found financial sustainability. “Billionaire newspaper ownership is coming under fire lately because of Soon-Shiong’s fecklessness and because Jeff Bezos has hit a few bumps with the Post, although I think that will prove to be temporary,” Kennedy told CNN, pointing to recent successes at The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Boston Globe newspapers. “There are reasons to be optimistic given the hundreds of independent local news organizations that have sprouted up in recent years,” he said. “The challenge is that coverage at the hyperlocal level is hit or miss, as some communities are well-served and others — especially in rural areas and in urban communities of color — tend to be overlooked.” But Rosen cautioned against the reliance on deep-pocketed philanthropists to sustain journalistic enterprises in the long-term. “Journalists have to take it upon themselves to treat sustainability as their problem, but this is not what they signed up for,” he said. “They signed up to do stories.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "L’Italia in sciopero, ma la gente non sa perché. Passeggiando per le vie della Capitale – tra Trastevere, Monteverde, Vaticano e il quartiere Prati -, le persone sono bloccate alla fermata del bus e i bar sono deserti. La maggioranza sa dell’esistenza dello sciopero generale – indetto da Cgil e Uil, con la partecipazione di Cobas, Cub ed Sgb, per protestare contro la legge di bilancio -, ma in molti ignorano le motivazioni alla base della scelta.”Non abbiamo proprio la più pallida idea del perché si scioperi”, spiega all’AGI Gabriella che gestisce il locale ‘Assolto’ di piazzale Clodio, luogo di ritrovo dei penalisti romani. L’attività, oggi, è insolitamente vuota. “Abbiamo perso parecchia clientela a causa dello sciopero” che ha riguardato trasporti pubblici, sanità e scuola. In difficoltà anche chi ha figli. Alcuni non sono andati a scuola, altri stanno uscendo prima dagli istituti.\n“Io non so perché si sciopera, ma sono in difficoltà perché” mio figlio “sta uscendo prima di scuola”, spiega una donna sulla quarantina. “Ci troviamo in difficoltà e non sappiamo le motivazioni” dello sciopero, dice. Andando avanti, sempre in zona Prati, una ragazza racconta di “non aver accusato disagi”, “perché mi muovo in macchina ed essendo partita” nel pomeriggio “non ho trovato traffico”, ma “non so perché si sciopera”. Uno studente universitario non è riuscito invece a raggiungere l’università a causa della mancanza dei mezzi. “Hanno annullato le lezioni”, racconta. Avrebbe dovuto prendere la metro, ma non è stato possibile.\n“Io non lo so perché scioperano, ormai li fanno all’acqua di rose. Forse il loro vero obiettivo è esasperare la gente”, sostiene invece un’estetista in fila alle Poste, in zona Trastevere. Intanto le fermate dei bus si riempiono. Roberta, 31 anni, e Patrizia, 35 anni, devono arrivare alla stazione Termini per tornare a Napoli e sono in difficoltà. “Non sappiamo perché si sciopera, ma il venerdì è una costante”.\nC’è però anche chi sa perché si sciopera e non è d’accordo. “Io so perché si sciopera: contro la manovra del Governo Meloni. Credo che sia uno sciopero politico manovrato dai sindacati che, da quando c’è la destra al governo, trovano qualsiasi scusa e opportunità per scioperare”, dice Raoul, titolare di un’agenzia viaggi. Infine, una coppia di pensionati, si dice a favore. “Si sciopera, evidentemente le cose non vanno bene – affermano -, altrimenti perché farlo”. – Fonte AGI –",
