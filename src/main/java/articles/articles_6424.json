He is in “good health”.\nFAMILY, FRIENDS CELEBRATE GOOD NEWS Celebrating his safe return, Josh Sullivan’s family and friends have shared their joy on Facebook.\nTonya Morton Rinker – the mother of the US pastor – posted: “HE’S HOME, My Baby is free! Joshua was rescued earlier today! He is home with Meagan and the kids. PRAISE GOD FOR HIS GRACE AND MERCY. Praise The Lord Jesus Christ!”\nOf reports that three suspects had been killed in a police shoot-out, she added in another post: “A sad situation.

    "title": "FIRST faculty cohort brings new research areas to College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences",
    "text": "In fall 2022, the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at UMBC and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) received a five-year, $13.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to enhance recruitment and training of junior faculty and promote inclusive excellence at UMBC. Since then, UMBC and UMSOM teams have been planning programming for the incoming FIRST (Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation) cohort, undertaking faculty searches, and otherwise preparing for their new colleagues’ arrival.\nAs of this fall, four new UMBC faculty members and three new UMSOM faculty have been selected, with three more to be added at UMSOM. Two of UMBC’s hires are busy doing research, recruiting students, and settling into their new positions. The other two will officially assume their roles in January, but they are already visiting campus and starting to set up their laboratory spaces.\nIn November, the leads on the grant from both institutions and all the new hires gathered at UMBC for a reception to celebrate their first semester and build community among the cohort.\nA talented group “Although I have only been on board for three months, I already feel the leadership’s dedication to supporting early-career faculty, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, through professional development and tailored resources,” shared Cheng-Yu Li , a new assistant professor of biological sciences at UMBC hired through the program. “I am excited to work alongside this talented group of scientists and contribute to advancing neuroscience research, education, and outreach.”\nLeft: Manfred Van Dulmen, UMBC’s provost, addresses attendees at the reception to celebrate the FIRST faculty. Jim Kaper, professor of microbiology and immunology and the UMSOM lead on the grant; Roger Ward, UMSOM provost; and Valerie Sheares Ashby, UMBC president, look on (from left to right). Right: Valerie Sheares Ashby, UMBC president, addresses the FIRST reception attendees. (Melissa Penley Cormier, M.F.A. ’17) Li’s research straddles neuroscience and behavior. His model system, African cichlid freshwater fish, is useful for studying reproductive and social behaviors , such as courtship rituals and aggression. Many of the mechanisms involved are applicable across a wide range of species.\nCarmen Muñoz-Ballester , another new assistant professor of biological sciences at UMBC, is finding her department colleagues and the FIRST cohort to be helpful resources as she navigates her first year.\n“The Department of Biological Sciences at UMBC provides a very supportive environment for building a scientific career, and I am very happy to be part of this thriving community,” Muñoz-Ballester says. “Life as a faculty member can be overwhelming at the beginning, and having the opportunity to share challenges and small wins with people in similar situations makes it much better. I am very glad to have my peers to count on in my daily life, and I am committed to making the most of this opportunity and paying it forward to future trainees and colleagues.”\nMuñoz-Ballester’s work focuses on sex differences in the response to traumatic brain injury. Severe or repeated brain injuries (such as seen in football players) are getting more attention today, and men suffer more traumatic brain injuries overall, but she notes that women tend to have worse outcomes than men after sustaining less-severe brain injuries. Muñoz-Ballester will work to unpack the neural mechanisms behind the effects of these injuries in both sexes, potentially leading to more effective treatments.\nWilliam R. LaCourse, dean of UMBC’s College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences and UMBC lead on the FIRST grant, addresses attendees at the reception. (Melissa Penley Cormier, M.F.A. ’17) Tackling the biggest challenges Diana Elizondo and Gretchen Alicea will round out the FIRST cohort at UMBC. Elizondo is an immunologist who uses mice to study signaling pathways involved in inflammation and metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity. Alicea focuses on how metabolic changes in the environment immediately surrounding malignant tumors are related to the risk of metastasis. Jose Lemme , Alisha Blazer , and Amed Outtara have been brought on board at UMSOM.\nWilliam R. LaCourse , CNMS dean, is thrilled to welcome these new members of the faculty to UMBC. Their research interests include some of the most pressing issues society faces today, like cancer and obesity. These researchers are also approaching study areas that may deserve more attention from innovative angles.\n“Thank you for choosing our institutions to be a part of your academic careers. We want you to know that your success goes beyond the UM FIRST program and even beyond tenure. Your success is that you always find joy in research, mentoring, teaching, and life,” LaCourse said at the reception. “This room is full of individuals who are there for you.”",

    "text": "MADRID, 5 Jul. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n La Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (UNESCO) ha aprobado este viernes la designación de once nuevas reservas de biosfera, entre las que se encuentran el Val d'Aran (Cataluña) y la reserva de Irati (Navarra), según ha informado la UNESCO. Estas dos nuevas declaraciones elevan a 55 las reservas de la biosfera en España, según han confirmado a Europa Press en fuentes del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico (MITECO).\n Las otras nuevas reservas de biosfera se encuentran en Colombia, Eslovenia, Filipinas, Italia, Mongolia, Países Bajos, la República de Corea y la República Dominicana. Con estas nuevas designaciones, que abarcan una superficie total de 37.400 km2, equivalente al tamaño de los Países Bajos, la Red Mundial de Reservas de Biosfera cuenta ahora con 759 reservas en 136 países.\n En concreto, las otras nuevas reservas de biosfera son Reserva de Biosfera Transfronteriza de Kempen-Broek (Bélgica, Reino de los Países Bajos); Reserva de Biosfera del Darién Norte Chocoano (Colombia); Reserva de Biosfera Transfronteriza de los Alpes Julianos (Eslovenia, Italia); Reserva de Biosfera de yApayaos (Filipinas); Reserva de Biosfera de Niumi (Gambia); Reserva de Biosfera de los Colli Euganei (Italia); Reserva de Biosfera del lago Khar Us (Mongolia); Reserva de Biosfera de Changnyeong (República de Corea); y Reserva de Biosfera Madre de las Aguas (República Dominicana).\n En su 36ª reunión, el Consejo Internacional de Coordinación del Programa sobre el Hombre y la Biosfera (MAB) de la UNESCO, órgano rector del Programa compuesto por 34 Estados Miembros de la UNESCO, fue el encargado de decidir estas incorporaciones. El Consejo se reunió del 2 al 5 de julio en Agadir (Marruecos), a continuación de la Conferencia de la UNESCO sobre los Suelos.\n Las reservas de biosfera son uno de los pilares del mandato de la UNESCO como organismo de las Naciones Unidas dedicado a las ciencias. Cada reserva de biosfera promueve soluciones locales innovadoras de desarrollo sostenible, protege la biodiversidad y hace frente a la alteración del clima. Las reservas también ayudan a las comunidades locales e indígenas a través de prácticas como la agroecología, la gestión del agua y la generación de ingresos ecológicos.\n Las reservas de biosfera contribuyen a que los Países alcancen los objetivos aprobados en diciembre de 2022 en el contexto del Marco Mundial de Biodiversidad de Kunming-Montreal, que aboga por la creación de zonas protegidas que cubran el 30% de la superficie terrestre y marina del planeta y por la restauración del 30% de los ecosistemas degradados del mundo de aquí a 2030.\n Enclavada en el extremo occidental de los Pirineos catalanes, la reserva de biosfera de la Val d'Aran se extiende a lo largo de unos 632 km2 y constituye el único valle de Cataluña orientado al norte. Su posición excepcional como cuenca situada entre el Mediterráneo y el Atlántico le confiere una gran diversidad de paisajes climáticos y biológicos. También es un bastión del patrimonio cultural y lingüístico occitano.\n La Val d’Aran, que cuenta con 9.983 habitantes, ha prosperado tradicionalmente gracias a actividades variadas, como la agricultura, la artesanía y el comercio. Últimamente, la reintroducción de los osos pardos ha suscitado preocupación entre los ganaderos de la región.\n La designación de la zona como reserva de biosfera ha representado un paso decisivo para mejorar la protección de la biodiversidad y revitalizar las prácticas tradicionales, con el fin de frenar la despoblación y facilitar la transición a un modelo de desarrollo rural más resiliente. El plan de gestión de la reserva de biosfera se ha concebido minuciosamente con los representantes de las aldeas y las asociaciones locales que promueven el turismo y la ganadería.\n Por su parte, la reserva de biosfera de Irati está situada en una zona de media montaña de los Pirineos occidentales y es un paraíso de la biodiversidad. Sus extensos bosques están compuestos principalmente por hayas y abetos, lo que la convierte en el segundo hayedo más grande de Europa. Engloba los pintorescos valles de Salazar y Aezkoa, en el extremo nororiental de Navarra, y tiene una superficie de 537 km2 en la que viven 2435 habitantes.\n La comunidad local, que ha participado activamente en el proceso de candidatura desde 2015, ha desempeñado un papel fundamental en la definición de la estructura de gestión de la reserva de biosfera. Esta estructura comprende un consejo ejecutivo y un consejo asesor que representan a diversas partes interesadas, en particular asociaciones culturales y de conservación y grupos de mujeres. El plan de gestión de la Reserva de Biosfera de Irati constituye un testimonio de los esfuerzos de conservación impulsados por la comunidad de la reserva.\nLeer más acerca de: Onu Educación Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica Despoblación en España Biodiversidad",
