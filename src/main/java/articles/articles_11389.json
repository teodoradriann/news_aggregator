La pluie abondante est arrivée quelques minutes plus tard, comme vous pouvez le voir dans les images ci-dessous. Comme l’a souligné la journaliste Alexandra Blanc, le match de basket 3x3 France-Serbie à la Concorde a d’ailleurs dû être interrompu pendant 30 minutes. Défaite des Bleus à la reprise.

Crues dans les Vosges Météo France avait placé une dizaine de départements en vigilance orange à la canicule ce jeudi soir, mais cette alerte concernait principalement le sud-ouest de l’Hexagone. Elle ne faisait pas état de fortes pluies attendues en Île-de-France, à part dans la Seine-et-Marne placée en vigilance orange crues. Les autres départements étaient en alerte jaune. Ils sont repassés en vert à minuit. La capitale n’a pas été la seule touchée.

    "text": "In the days and weeks leading up to January 6, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, was moving in lockstep with the political anxieties of top Democratic leaders.\nThese Democrats grew anxious as over 140 House Republicans planned to contest the election results during the electoral college certification that day. Milley was then deeply engaged with a circle of confidants including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, among others—all of whom shared a unified disdain for President Donald Trump.\n[snip]\n....He indicated that these concerns were influenced behind the scenes by Milley, who often made disparaging remarks about the president and regularly referred to his fear of a so-called potential “Reichstag moment.”\nMeanwhile, Milley has insisted he maintained a posture of strict neutrality, vocally distancing his leadership of the military from the political turmoil surrounding the 2020 presidential election. \"My job is to stay clean by ensuring that the uniformed military remains out of domestic politics,\" Milley stated during his testimony before the January 6 Select Committee. \"The United States military has no role in domestic politics, period, full stop.\"\n[snip]\nMilley saw himself as “tasked” with safeguarding “against Trump and his people” from potentially misusing the military, something he confided in a “trusted confidant” to ensure he remained true to this plan. “I have four tasks from now until the twentieth of January,” he affirmed, “and I’m going to accomplish my mission.”",

    "text": "在网友帮助下，覃宏叶穿上公主裙圆了“公主梦”。 （受访者供图） 覃宏叶坐轮椅努力训练的短视频获百万网友点赞。 （网络截图） 　　■本报记者 韦薇 通讯员 蒋寿兰 农琦\n　　视频里，20岁的广西女孩覃宏叶坐着轮椅在篮球场上打球，每一次投篮、每一回突破，都洋溢着顽强与自信，如璀璨星辰般闪耀动人……近日，两条短视频吸引超百万人次围观，分别获得近199万、254万个点赞。3月18日，记者采访了解到，这个女孩灿烂笑容的背后，藏着一段充满温暖与希望、交织着困境与拼搏的逐梦旅程。\n青春折翼 脊柱损伤轮椅相伴\n　　覃宏叶是广西轮椅篮球队队员，家住广西来宾。她的人生，在初中时遭遇重创：脊柱损伤的诊断书，如同命运无情的宣判。起初她还能正常行走，但病情逐渐恶化，到2019年，她彻底失去了站立和行走的能力。经过一年康复治疗，她虽然能勉强移步，但因家庭经济等现实因素，不得不中断康复治疗，轮椅成了她生活的依靠。\n　　那段日子，覃宏叶内心满是挣扎。行动不便带来的无力感，让她事事受限；曾经的朋友，也因生活轨迹不同，渐行渐远。她主动远离社交，孤独如影随形，情绪也愈发低落，感觉生活仿佛陷入无尽黑暗。\n　　2024年10月下旬，覃宏叶偶然从老家来宾当地残联工作人员处得知：“龙年轮BA”三人制轮椅篮球（广西站）推广活动在桂林举行。这个消息如同一束微光，照进了她黯淡的生活。出于对篮球的热爱和对桂林山水的憧憬，她报名参加活动。\n　　都说“桂林山水甲天下”，网上关于桂林美景、人文的视频，让覃宏叶心生向往。患病后，去桂林的愿望变得遥不可及，但这次活动的机遇，让她鼓起了勇气。“去桂林看看”，这个简单的念头，支撑她迈出了勇敢的一步。\n结缘篮球 融入团队感受温暖\n　　抵达桂林后，如诗如画的山水让她沉醉不已。在广西轮椅篮球队训练基地，看着队员们灵活地操控轮椅，熟练地传球、投篮，一幕幕充满激情的场景深深触动了她。原本以为只是一次普通的参观活动，没想到，这是命运的重大转机——她成功入选广西轮椅篮球女队，从此与轮椅篮球结下不解之缘。\n　　初到训练基地，覃宏叶面临诸多难题。习惯独居的她，在融入集体生活时有些不知所措；和队友年龄差距较大，让她在生活中遇到问题时羞于开口；对轮椅篮球的陌生，更是让训练充满艰辛。\n　　幸运的是，覃宏叶身边围绕着一群温暖的队友。室友李永馨就像是知心姐姐，不仅带她熟悉队里生活，教她使用无障碍器械，还耐心传授控球技巧。覃宏叶说，和队友初次见面时，她紧张得不知如何打招呼，是李永馨热情地帮她收拾行李，瞬间驱散了她内心的不安。队友蒋薇则帮助覃宏叶融入老队员的圈子。在蒋薇的引领下，覃宏叶很快和大家熟络起来。\n　　队友们无微不至的关怀，让覃宏叶感受到家的温暖。“大家性格各异，但对我的照顾都体现在生活点滴里，真的特别感动。”她说。\n　　为了让覃宏叶尽快跟上训练进度，队里安排广西轮椅篮球男队队长张厚奇指导她。在轮椅篮球场上，轮椅就是运动员的双腿，操控技术至关重要。这种特殊的“八字形”无刹车轮椅，全靠双手掌控。刚开始，覃宏叶运球和推动轮椅难以协调，双手磨得脱皮、长茧，还多次险些摔倒。张厚奇始终耐心鼓励她，时刻关注她的状态，帮助她反复打磨动作，逐渐实现“人车合一”。\n　　经过几个月的刻苦训练，如今覃宏叶已经能在球场上操控轮椅运球过人、精准投篮。每次篮球入网，她都仿佛找回曾经奔跑的感觉。\n心怀热爱 书写青春热血篇章\n　　在覃宏叶努力训练的过程中，一名自媒体博主听说了她的故事，被她的坚持和热爱所打动，将她的经历拍成视频发布到网络上。没想到，视频迅速走红，点赞量一路飙升，越来越多的人认识了这个在轮椅上逐梦的女孩。\n　　随着视频爆火，覃宏叶收获了大量关注和支持。这名博主还带她前往上海迪士尼乐园，帮助她圆了穿公主裙的梦想，相关视频同样收获无数点赞。曾经觉得生活失去希望的她，如今成了许多人的精神榜样。\n　　面对采访，覃宏叶说：“网友们的关注和支持是我坚持下去的巨大动力，让我更坚定要打好篮球。我不是什么传奇主角，只是找到了热爱的篮球。”\n　　篮球场上，这个美丽的女孩用轮椅划出最美弧线，书写热血篇章。她说，会带着这份热爱和信念继续逐梦，“我想成为广西队主力，在赛场上为团队争光。未来，我会继续努力，在篮球场上绽放光芒”。\n　　通过自身经历，覃宏叶也希望给同样身体不便的人传递信念：“即便行动受限，我们依然能追求热爱。遇到困难，别害怕，残疾人体育项目中有温暖的团队和无限的可能。”",

    "text": "Warmer weather and reduced rainfall has sped up crop growth for many producers in Saskatchewan, according to the province’s latest crop report. From July 9 to July 15, more crops moved closer to their normal stages of development. For this time of year, 90 per cent of fall cereals and 68 per cent of spring cereals are at normal stages, while 27 per cent are falling behind. Sixty-six per cent of oilseeds are at normal stages of development and 30 per cent are falling behind. For pulse crops, 78 per cent are at normal stages and 18 per cent are falling behind. Seventy-seven per cent of perennial forages and 76 per cent of annual forages are at normal stages. While the heat has helped speed up crop growth in parts of the province, many regions are hoping for moisture over the next week to help support further crop development, reduce crop stress and maintain topsoil moisture conditions. Cropland topsoil moisture is currently rated as four per cent surplus, 77 per cent adequate, 17 per cent short, and two per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is at three per cent surplus, 76 per cent adequate, 18 per cent short, and three per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is at three per cent surplus, 71 per cent adequate, 22 per cent short, and four per cent very short. Minor to moderate crop damage has been reported in the southwest portion of the province due to lack of moisture. Other crop damage was due to gophers, grasshoppers, hail, heat, and wind. Producers will finish fungicide spraying, haying operations, and getting equipment ready for harvest over the upcoming weeks.
