    "title": "L'errore della ciotola quando fai mangiare il tuo cane: evitalo",
    "text": "La salute del proprio cane passa in primis dall’alimentazione che il proprietario sceglie per lui: spesso, anche se lo facciamo con tutto l’affetto del mondo, possiamo incappare in errori dalle conseguenze potenzialmente pericolose per il benessere di Fido ( [sai perché ogni tanto ci ruba le pantofole?](https://www.supereva.it/se-il-cane-prende-le-tue-pantofole-non-sgridarlo-ecco-perche-59745)) e quando parliamo di cibo esiste più di un’accortezza da mettere in pratica. Le abitudini da evitare Partiamo dal fatto che è buona norma non seguire le indicazioni riportate sulla busta dei croccantini: sempre meglio – fanno sapere gli esperti di Dog Lab – mettere meno cibo nella ciotola scongiurando così il rischio di sovrappeso. Alcuni padroni, poi, sono soliti dare al proprio amico a quattro zampe le ossa cotte, ma sono piuttosto pericolose perché potrebbero scheggiarsi mentre i cani le rosicchiano, incunearsi o peggio perforare il loro intestino. Chi sta tutto il giorno fuori casa spesso preferisce lasciare che il cane si nutra da solo ( [questo, per esempio, va tutti i giorni a fare spesa autonomamente](https://www.supereva.it/questo-cane-va-tutti-i-giorni-a-fare-la-spesa-da-solo-40711)) quando ha fame, ma l’alimentazione libera non è il modo giusto per provvedere ai suoi bisogni: consigliato, in questi casi, utilizzare un dispensatore automatico di cibo pre-impostato su programmi adatti alla stazza e alle abitudini alimentari di Fido, senza contare che l’alimentazione cambia in base alle età (Ecco il nuovo metodo per contare gli anni umani del nostro cagnolino) e alla razza: sapevate che i cani di taglia piccola hanno bisogno di mangiare poco ma spesso? L’errore più comune da evitare L’errore alimentare più comune che i proprietari di animali domestici commettono è quello insegnare inavvertitamente ai loro cani a chiedere cibo al di fuori dei pasti dando loro piccole gratificazioni gastronomiche. A questo proposito gli esperti raccomandano di nutrire Fido soltanto dalla ciotola, senza dargli cibo dalla mano, cosicché non assuma comportamenti sbagliati e soprattutto calorie extra non necessarie al suo fabbisogno… Se poi avete in casa un cane chef come questo, allora le cose possono essere un po’ più complicate!",

    "text": "The past few weeks have seen a series of real estate projects, including social housing projects, deployed in many localities across the country, heralding the recovery of the market that has slumped for a couple of years.\nA recent survey conducted by the Vietnam Association of Real Estate Brokers indicates that more than half of the surveyed businesses said local authorities have begun implementing policies aimed at removing difficulties in the real estate market.\nThe Government has actively directed relevant ministries to iron out snags faced by real estate businesses throughout the year, and the legal framework and investment procedures are much more conducive compared to a year ago, said Nguyen Anh Tuan, general director of Phuong Dong Joint Stock Company.\nTuan expressed his hope that banks would allocate resources to improve credit accessibility for buyers and developers in an appropriate manner moving forward.\nThe Government has introduced a number of mechanisms and policies, including those on capital resources, in recent times aimed at removing bottlenecks for the real estate market.\nMost notably, the Prime Minister on December 17 issued an official dispatch on solutions to develop the real estate market in a safe, healthy, and sustainable manner.\nEconomist Can Van Luc highly appreciated the Government’ efforts to revitalize the real estate market with a number of hindrances being lifted.\nHowever, he underlined the need to fine-tune institutions and speed up the amendments of laws to ensure their consistency in a bid to facilitate the recovery of the real estate market.\nA series of projects in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are currently getting underway and may open for sale at the end of this year or by early 2024, which will provide buyers with a greater range of options.\nThere is ample room ahead for the development of the real estate market thanks to a decrease in bank interest rates coupled with the Government’s support policies, anallysed Nguyen Quoc Anh, deputy general director of Batdongsan.com.vn.\nHe pointed out that the demand for social housing products remains high in the market amid a general scarcity of supply, noting that the Government will support the market segment in the coming time.\nAlthough the real estate market is showing positive signs of recovery, local businesses are advised to restructure and move to diversify capital sources, as well as limiting ineffective investments.\nThink-tanks forecast that prices of some real estate segments would continue to fall in the short term as owners would be forced to sell their assets under pressure to borrow interest from banks for a long time.\nCurrently, there are more than 100,000 apartments under construction nationwide. If legal procedures related to project progress are cleared, then it will help to improve supply sources in the market and better meet the relevant needs of buyers.\nFurthermore, insiders underscored the importance of approving the new law on Real Estate Business and Housing Law put forward by the National Assembly.\nIf the revised Land Law is soon approved and takes effect as planned in the second half of next year, it is expected to create a major turning point for the real estate market's recovery, they noted.\nSource: VOV",

    "text": "歌声响彻振华两校 周金亮唱出华教精神\n（芙蓉11日讯）为了弘扬华文教育精神，芙蓉振华校友会联手马来西亚华校教师会总会，特别邀请本地资深音乐人周金亮，为振华中学及振中二校呈献一场别开生面的华教音乐分享会，带领师生了解华教的历史与发展历程。\n周金亮时隔一年重返芙蓉，今天走入上述两所华文中学展开“说唱华教歌曲”校园分享会，以轻松的说唱方式，结合一首首耳熟能详的经典歌曲与华教歌曲，让在场师生沉浸于音乐之中。\nADVERTISEMENT\n他一边弹奏吉他，一边演唱其代表作《用马来西亚的天气来说爱你》，以及《我是一只小小鸟》、《一颗种籽》、《因为明天》、《海阔天空》等歌曲，透过旋律与歌词，让学生感受语言和文化的魅力。\n在分享过程中，周金亮也畅谈自己的音乐旅程与创作心路，并结合对华教的观察与体悟，激发学生对中文创作的兴趣，进一步提升他们对母语的热爱与认同。\n在他的带动下，全体师生齐声合唱，歌声响彻校园，掌声此起彼落，营造出温馨欢乐、充满热血气息的校园氛围。\n此外，活动现场也开放以优惠价格售卖周金亮的《因为明天》华教歌曲专辑，所有所得收入将全数捐予教总基金，以支持华文教育的发展。\n振华校友会主席王金忠表示，该会邀请周金亮走入校园，主要目的是让莘莘学子更加了解我国华教的历史，深入体会华教背后的奋斗精神，尤其是对“族魂”林连玉的认识。\n他说，我国华教历经数十年的风雨，留下了许多动人的旋律与感人的故事，希望学生们能透过这些歌曲，体会前辈们坚守初心的精神，理解他们肩负的使命，从而将中华文化的传承薪火相传。\n他指出，华教之路能走到今天，是先辈坚持与奉献的成功，希望分享会能激发学生们对华教的认识与热忱，珍惜在华文中学里得以学习母语的环境。\n他也特别感谢周金亮在百忙之中抽空，为两所华中带来这场充满教育意义的音乐分享会。\n沉香州议员吴金财在振华中学主持分享会首站的开幕仪式时表示，我国今天的发展与繁荣，华社在其中扮演了重要角色，付出了巨大的努力。\n他指出，华文中学之所以分为独中与国民型中学，是国家政策演变所导致的结果，而政府过去曾推行“宏愿学校”政策，但落实过程中却面对许多问题。\n他续说，团结政府上任后，很庆幸能通过内部协商的方式争取更多资源支持华教的发展，无论是在希盟或团结政府的领导下，给予华校的拨款、资源及师资也不断获得增加。\n“因此，年轻人必须明白，今天我们还能使用中文名字、接受母语教育都得来不易，你们长大后应懂得回馈母校，继续支持华文教育的长期发展，确保传承不会在这一代中断。”\n亚沙国会议员谢琪清在振华二校担任开幕嘉宾时则说，热爱华教的人士普遍上都有一个共同愿景，希望华教在这片国土上发展得越来越好，而大家也以不同的方式推动华教向前迈进。\n他指出，推动华教发展的方式有很多，音乐也是其中一种，年轻人透过音乐不仅可提升对华教的热忱，也能更加了解华教在我国独立前后的发展历程。\n他也以振华二校的礼堂为例，强调这是社会人士无私付出的成果，反映出华社不同单位以各自的方式支持华教，只为下一代能在更好的教育环境中成长。\n他说，教育最终受益者是孩子，而他们正是国家未来的栋梁。\n此外，谢琪清与吴金财各别宣布拨款3000令吉予振华校友会，作为活动基金。\n出席者尚有芙蓉县教育署华校助理署长李锦威督学、教总教育推广组执行主任骆淑慧、教育推广组执行员郭青龙、振华校友会署理主席管建方、副主席司徒威、总务黄永志、副财政冯绣玲、活动理事黎有为、振中校长邱尔建、振华二校副董事长洪静思、董事黄伟诗、校长宋俐颖等。\nADVERTISEMENT\n热门新闻\n百格视频\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) – The Czech-led initiative to buy ammunition for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion has raised enough so far to purchase a first batch of 300,000 artillery shells, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on X social media platform on Friday.\n“Our goal is to deliver much more!” he said. “Our work and our help to Ukraine do not end here. We keep seeking partners so that we can continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight against the Russian aggressor.”\nCzech President Petr Pavel had said on Thursday the initiative had collected the amount needed for acquiring 800,000 ammunition pieces that had earlier been found and were available from unspecified countries outside Europe.\nA government adviser was quoted as saying in Czech media on Thursday evening, after Pavel had spoken of secured financing, that the full purchase was still not covered and there was no target amount in the initiative.\nPavel had last month said 500,000 rounds of 155-calibre ammunition and 300,000 rounds of 122-calibre ammunition were available and could be delivered with secured funding.\nSeveral European Union members and countries outside the bloc have made pledges to the ammunition drive for Ukraine, as fighting against Russia’s full-scale invasion hits a third year.\nIt comes as the EU will miss a year-old target to deliver one million ammunition rounds to Ukraine this month and as U.S. military aid, which has been the backbone of international support for Kyiv, has stalled.\nNorway said on Thursday it would donate up to 1.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) for the Czech plan. That followed pledges by Germany and France this week.\nPavel said on Thursday that 18 countries had joined the initiative.\n(Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

    "text": "Debate\nZsofia Kovacs' injury—Can Team Hungary bounce back, or is their Olympic dream shattered?\nInstead of being the City of Love, Paris can well turn out to be the City of Nightmares. Getting injured before the biggest sporting tournament of the year isn’t something that any athlete would look forward to, but it’s called a bolt out of the blue for a reason. The Paris Olympics will be flagged off tomorrow, and gymnasts, like all other sports stars around the world, have been preparing for months, if not years, in a bid to etch their names among the elites. However, not all efforts will work out according to plans.\nKeeping in mind the stakes, athletes from all countries have been cautious to ensure their peak physical conditions. And yet, injuries shine their ferocious claws just hours before the Opening Ceremony.\nHungarian website M4 Sport has shared shocking updates about one of the country’s most prominent gymnasts in\nan article today. The 2022 European Championships vault gold medalist Zsófia Kovács of Hungary has fallen prey to a freak injury while podium training, and this could keep her from competing on the biggest stage. Kovács injured the very knee on which she had to undergo surgeries last September due to a cruciate ligament.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe head coach of the Hungarian national team, Imre Draskóczy, stated, “…we and Zsófi’s coach, János Trenka, saw that her jump was also fine, but Zsófi got to her leg and unfortunately injured her operated leg. The medical team immediately took her into treatment.” He also revealed that an MRI is scheduled for tomorrow to decide whether the three-time European champion can indeed perform in the coming weeks while also noting that she can “almost certainly” be replaced by the alternate gymnasts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nRight after the surgery, Kovács chose to opt out of several tournaments, including last year’s World Championships, this year’s continental championships, the Hungarian national championships, and the Gymnastics World Cup, despite traveling to all of them with the team. However, the misfortune that befell the Hungarian star seems to have its eyes set on causing trouble to many of her international colleagues as well.\nParis Olympics hopes rummaged by injuries running wild\nThe legendary Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina also injured herself last month during training for the Asian Gymnastics Championships in her national capital and announced that she would be pulling out of the race to Paris. Along with the eight-time Olympian, the USA’s three-time Olympic gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, also had to wave goodbye to her hope of representing the nation at the big showdown. Returning to action after eight long years, Douglas could have had one last emphatic ride at the Olympics, but an ankle injury forced her to pull out of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships, making it impossible for the 28-year-old to secure a spot in Team USA.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nTwo-time World Championships team gold medalists Skye Blakely and Shilese Jones were also forced to end their Parisian dreams after having run-ins with injuries. After a seminal second-place finish at the Xfinity US Championships, Blakely injured her Achilles at the US Olympic Team Trials and had to be carried off the arena. Jones, too, injured her knee at the Trials and had to take her exit from the road to the French capital.\nFurthermore, Dutch gymnast and two-time European Championships medalist\nVera van Pol also withdrew from the 2024 Games after a foot injury. While all these stars will now have to watch their compadres from the sidelines, which country and squad do you think will have the last laugh when the dust settles in the French capital?",

    "text": "“Il Consiglio dei ministri, a quanto apprendiamo, ha modificato la norma che introduceva un taglio lineare sulle detrazioni fiscali per i redditi superiori ai 50mila euro: sarebbero ora escluse quelle per le donazioni alle Onlus e al Terzo settore. È una buona notizia e apprezziamo che il Governo sia tornato sui suoi passi rispetto a una misura che avrebbe inciso negativamente sulla propensione al dono degli italiani, senza tuttavia apportare grandi guadagni per le casse dello Stato”. Lo dichiara Vanessa Pallucchi, portavoce del Forum Terzo settore. “Dopo una battuta d’arresto legata alla pandemia, le persone stanno riprendendo a donare: è un gesto di solidarietà e un impegno civico alla portata di tutti che va incoraggiato, e le detrazioni fiscali, previste anche dal Codice del Terzo settore, sono uno strumento efficace per farlo”. “Attendiamo invece conferma nel testo del decreto Milleproroghe sullo slittamento al 31 dicembre 2024 dell’entrata in vigore del nuovo regime Iva per gli enti non commerciali compresi quelli di Terzo settore che, seppur non risolutivo, aiuterebbe molto soprattutto le piccole associazioni”, conclude Pallucchi.",

    "text": "Психолог пожаловалась на поощряющих онлайн-образование родителей и учителей\nИз-за этого дети становятся «электронно-зависимыми». Они нуждаются в живом общении, необходимо его «предлагать», подчеркнула в эфире радиостанции «Говорит Москва» кандидат психологических наук Жанна Сугак. «Они [молодые люди — прим. ГМ] должны это [живое общение — прим. ГМ] видеть и понимать, они должны в этом участвовать, им должны это предлагать. Мы сначала их сажали на электронную среду, посмотрите, что сейчас происходит: везде искусственный интеллект, электронные учебники, электронные доски в школах, онлайн-школы, онлайн-образование. А теперь: «Ой, а что происходит? Почему так?» Сначала родители, они все хотят онлайн, они все абсолютно считают, что это замечательная вещь, которая решает все абсолютно проблемы, а потом школа. Нам надо вырастить поколение учителей, которое понимает, что общение в обучении — это основная часть. Обучение — вторично. Но у нас нет такого поколения, мы растим по-прежнему электронно-зависимых людей». Ранее IT-эксперт рассказал о психотерапевтическом эффекте соцсетей.",
