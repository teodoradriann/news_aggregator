    "title": "La IA podría producir hasta 5 millones de toneladas de residuos electrónicos en 10 años",
    "text": "La Inteligencia Artificial (IA) depende de mejoras tecnológicas rápidas, incluida la infraestructura de hardware y los chips. Las actualizaciones necesarias para seguir el ritmo del crecimiento de la tecnología podrían agravar los problemas existentes en cuanto a la acumulación de desechos electrónicos: al generar que los equipos se vuelvan obsoletos cada vez con mayor rapidez, los desechos podrían multiplicarse y crear un nuevo problema ambiental. Un nuevo estudio publicado recientemente en la revista Nature Computational Science sugiere que la expansión de la Inteligencia Artificial (IA) generativa, que marca la evolución de esta tecnología, y principalmante los modelos lingüísticos de gran tamaño (LLM), podrían producir entre 1,2 y 5 millones de toneladas de basura electrónica acumulada entre 2020 y 2030. En un escenario de creciente complejidad en cuanto a la gestión de los desechos informáticos, los residuos producidos por la IA podrían agravar este inconveniente. La IA generativa es capaz de crear textos, imágenes u otros medios en respuesta a comandos: aunque ya se encuentra en desarrollo, promete una intensa evolución en los próximos años. Sin embargo, requiere recursos informáticos sustanciales para la capacitación e inferencia del modelo: frente a esto, aún no se han abordado las implicaciones de los desechos electrónicos que pueda generar y sus estrategias de gestión. Los autores del nuevo estudio, de la Academia China de Ciencias y la Universidad Reichman en Israel, presentan un marco de análisis de flujo de materiales, basado en la potencia computacional, para cuantificar y explorar formas de administrar los desechos electrónicos producidos por la IA generativa, con un enfoque centrado en los modelos de lenguaje grande. Vale recordar que estos modelos son los más utilizados en las aplicaciones masivas y están detrás de los chatbots como ChatGPT o Gemini, entre otros. De acuerdo a un artículo publicado en Science Alert, las necesidades tecnológicas de estos sistemas plantean problemas críticos de sostenibilidad, incluido el consumo de energía y la huella de carbono asociados con estas operaciones. A esto hay que sumarle una realidad relacionada con el consumo hogareño: si la IA generarativa acelera la obsolescencia de los equipos, tendremos al mismo tiempo una multiplicación de los residuos electrónicos. Según informa Aiwire, en 2022 se produjeron 62 millones de toneladas de desechos electrónicos a nivel global, un dato que representa un aumento del 82 % con respecto a los niveles de 2010. Si esta tendencia se mantiene, se prevé que la generación mundial de desechos informáticos aumente en un 32 % adicional, llegando potencialmente a 82 millones de toneladas para 2030. Los cálculos del nuevo estudio agregan otros posibles 5 millones de toneladas producidos específicamente por el avance de la IA. Por último, el profesor Shaolei Ren, de la Universidad de California en Riverside, en Estados Unidos, quien no participó de la investigación, indicó en una publicación de Science Media Centre España que “la previsión del documento es un indicador razonable de los residuos electrónicos que probablemente generará la IA generativa. Se trata de una cuestión crítica, aunque a menudo se pasa por alto, a la hora de considerar el futuro impacto social de la IA generativa. Además de invitar a un debate más profundo, la investigación destaca el papel crucial de una economía circular para lograr una IA verdaderamente sostenible”, concluyó Ren.

    "text": "BabyDrill might be one of the hottest names in the game in 2024, and it looks like he wants to kick things off strong. Moreover, he just released a new single and music video, exclusively on YouTube at press time and not on streaming services, titled \"What's the Ticket.\" Furthermore, it follows previous singles like \" [Watchin Now](/740254-babydrill-watchin-now-stream)\" and other big moments from the rapper's breakout 2023, which hopefully translates into better material moving forward. This new cut is a solid indicator of that reality, displaying his penchant for warbled but charismatic flows. Not only that, but the Atlanta MC makes sure to pace himself appropriately throughout his verses to break up their progression. Meanwhile, the instrumental on \"What's the Ticket\" is a dark and menacing one with ghostly synth pads, a very faint and simple melody building off of them, and a hardened Southern trap drum pattern. It doesn't evolve or go in any significantly new direction, so you know it's meant to emphasize BabyDrill's verse and wordplay. On that front, his lines are more vivid and impactful than anything else, but he still has sharper ones in the bag. \"The city full of lollipops, stay away from suckers,\" the \" [WHAT'S THE MOVE?](/733016-the-kid-laroi-future-babydrill-whats-the-move-single)\" spitter warns after the first chorus. With eclectic ad-libs, lyrical focuses on street proficiency and larger success than his rivals, and a very light additional synth melody for the chorus, this song will make you feel untouchable on a late night drive.

    "title": "Maker’s Mark Just Topped the List of Best-Selling American Whiskeys",
    "text": "American\nwhiskey sales might have been overtaken by agave spirits here in its home country, but the category continues to do big business around the world. Industry news website Drinks International just published its list of the bestselling American whiskey around the world, and the results might surprise you with Maker’s Mark taking the number one spot.\nThe list focuses specifically on whiskey sold at bars, so essentially it indicates what consumers are most thirsty for when they visit on premise establishments. Drinks International polled 100 bars in 33 countries for this survey, selecting places that have appeared on esteemed lists like the\nWorld’s 50 Best Bars and Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Awards. https://robbreport.com/food-drink/spirits/makers-mark-cellar-aged-bourbon-whiskey-1234882668/ might seem like an unexpected whiskey to take the top spot on this list given the massive sales and name recognition that brands like Jack Daniel’s and Jim Beam White Label lay claim to. Maker’s and Jim Beam are both owned by Beam Suntory, and while White Label has been a go-to, bottom-shelf “shot and a beer” bourbon for many years, Maker’s has had less of an imprint and is priced higher. Apparently, drinkers are willing to pay a little more for better bourbon, which gave Maker’s the edge over some of its cheaper and more widely available competitors.\nThe rest of the list is made up of well-known American whiskey brands from major Kentucky and Tennessee distilleries, so don’t expect any craft or American single malts on here and it looks like only one rye whiskey made the grade. The complete list is as follows:\n- Maker’s Mark\nBulleit Michter’s Woodford Reserve Buffalo Trace Wild Turkey\n- Jim Beam\nhttps://robbreport.com/food-drink/spirits/jack-daniels-single-barrel-proof-rye-whiskey-1234844738/\n- Rittenhouse Rye\nFour Roses\nIt will be interesting to see what happens over the next year and if there is any change to this list–most likely that would be a few brands trading spots, but likely no major addition or subtraction to really shake things up. Still, you never know, an excellent blender like\nBarrell Craft Spirits could explode in popularity and make the cut in 2024.",

    "title": "Disney Workers Demand $30 Million In Pay Negotiations",
    "text": "Workers at Disneyland Paris have upped the ante in their annual pay discussions with management by demanding a package of benefits which would cost the theme park operator in excess of $30 million.\nThe talks began earlier this month and threaten to cast a dark spell on the fortunes of the theme park complex which made a $193.3 million (€175 million) operating profit on record revenue of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion) last year as we revealed in The Guardian .\nIt comes at just the wrong time for Disney's Experiences division, which includes its theme parks and cruise lines. Disney's executives like to boast that it has delivered record profit and revenue for multiple quarters but those days are gone.\nIn May, Disney's stock began a steep decline after its chief financial officer Hugh Johnston warned of a softening in theme park attendance due to \"a global moderation from peak post‐Covid travel\". It set the scene for a dramatic fall from grace.\nLast month Disney announced that in the third quarter to 29 June, Experiences revenue rose by 2% to $9.3 billion ($8.4 billion) thanks to higher guest spending at its domestic parks and cruise lines, as well as increased spending per-room. However, it is a sharp decline on the 13% increase in the revenue of the equivalent segment over the same period in 2023 compared to the previous year.\nMORE FOR YOU Meet The World’s Oldest Fish—Presumed Extinct For 60 Million Years, Then Rediscovered In A Small Fishing Town ‘The Acolyte’ Fan Petition Shows Just How Right Disney Was To Cancel The ‘Star Wars’ Flop, After All Northern Lights Alert: States Where Aurora Borealis May Be Visible Tonight Worse still, the operating profit of Disney's Experiences division declined by 3% to $2.4 billion ($2.2 billion) in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.\nThe worst could be yet to come as Disney's earnings statement revealed that \"the demand moderation we saw in our domestic businesses in Q3 could impact the next few quarters. While we are actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing our cost base, we expect Q4 Experiences segment operating income to decline by mid single digits versus the prior year.\"\nJohnston added that \"we saw attendance flat in the quarter\" with a \"flattish revenue number\" forecast for the fourth quarter and a slowdown expected for \"a few quarters.\" Disneyland Paris represented almost half of the revenue of Disney's international parks last year and 17.5% of its operating profit so it is far from insignificant.\nThe decline in the division's overall operating profit was driven by costs climbing at Disney's domestic parks so the last thing Disney needs is to have to pay workers more in Paris. However, it may have little choice about that.\nLast week the Disneyland Paris branch of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) became the first union to put its cards on the table in the pay discussion. Writing in Blooloop , the world's leading themed entertainment industry outlet, we revealed that the CFDT has demanded a 6% pay rise, up from 5.5% last year. It is far ahead of the 3.5% average which accountancy giant Deloitte forecasts across all areas of French industry for 2024.\nOn the eve of the second round of talks, which took place today, the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA), a French confederation of trade unions, issued its demands. They cover everything from increased pay for working on Sundays to longer compassionate leave and measures to level out the gender pay gap.\nHowever, the star attraction for workers is the proposal for a \"bonus of 1,200 Euros net for each employee.\" It is 20% more than the CFDT asked for and a staggering 71.4% increase on the bonus paid last year to staff at Disneyland Paris. The latest filings for the resort's operating company, Euro Disney Associés (EDA), show that it employs 17,702 staff bringing the total cost of the bonus alone to $23.4 million (€21.2 million) but it doesn't stop there.\nThe UNSA has done away with demanding a percentage-based pay rise by instead asking for a \"general increase of 200 Euros net for all employees.\" That would cost EDA a further $3.9 million (€3.5 million) giving a total of $27.3 million from these two perks alone. Then comes the cost of all the other benefits that the UNSA is asking for, chief of which is reimbursing 100% of employees' public transport costs. That's in addition to doubling private transport mileage expenses and creating a green mobility bonus.\nAs we revealed in July, the staff in Paris are the only employees of any Disney resort who receive a share of its profits, putting them amongst the world's most well-paid theme park workers. However, there is good reason why they need more money.\nThe political system in France has been in deadlock since snap elections took place in early July, with no party able to form a clear majority in the country's National Assembly. Testimony to this, it took French president Emmanual Macron two months to find a new Prime Minister who appealed to enough politicians to get elected.\nThe instability dented consumer confidence in France and contributed to the country's rate of inflation failing to fall as much as analysts expected last month. It reversed from 2.3% in July to 1.9% in August but didn't drop across the board. According to France's national statistics bureau, prices in the service sector rose from 2.6% to 3.1% in August, especially in accommodation and transport.\nIt has been felt at a grassroots level with 75% of 1,200 hospitality professionals in France revealing in a recent survey that tourist spending has fallen this year.\nAccording to another survey, only 38% of the 1,000 tourism professionals interviewed said they were satisfied with their July financial results, compared with more than 80% between 2019 and 2022. About 70% of the respondents recorded a drop in sales with French newspaper Le Monde reporting that, out of all of the reasons for this, \"the most important was the rise in prices.\"\nIn June France's central bank forecast that inflation would hit 2.5% over the next year which is more than double the rate in 2019. However, it is still a marked decline on the past two years.\nInflation surged throughout 2022 hitting a peak of 6.3% in February last year. By then, the cost of electricity in France had risen almost four-fold since Russia invaded Ukraine whilst flour, butter and eggs were about 50% more expensive.\nDisneyland Paris made sure it didn't lose out. It waved its magic wand in 2022 and increased one day, two-park ticket prices by 8.4% to $142.51 (€129) with annual passes rising the following year.\nAs we revealed in The Times , the ticket price hikes, combined with the opening of a new land themed to the hit Avengers movies, led to EDA's revenue rising nearly three-fold to $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion) in 2022. It outstripped a 57.8% increase in costs leaving the company with a $51.9 million (€47 million) operating profit, its highest in a decade. It didn't escape the attention of the staff.\n\"We see the figures, the profits they have made, the wealth that has been communicated by the Walt Disney Company,\" said Disneyland Paris worker Ahmed Masrour in an interview last summer with French news magazine L'Obs . \"The visitors sometimes chat with us and say to us: 'You're right, we don't understand why the ticket price has increased, why the prices of all the products at Disneyland have increased, starting with car parking, while you employees, your salary does not follow suit.'\"\nIronically, the employees are known as cast members due to the roles they play in a themed environment but the atmosphere was anything but a fairytale at Disneyland Paris last summer. Cast members demanded a monthly wage rise of $221.48 (€200) as well as an increase to the bonus to long-serving staff and higher pay for working on Sundays. Management dug its heels in leading to a series of increasingly tense strikes through the two parks at Disneyland Paris. It shattered the fairytale atmosphere in the run up to last year's pay negotiations. This had a magic touch as the cast members ended up with a bumper package of benefits thanks to the UNSA's tireless work.\nAlthough there have been no strikes this year and inflation is sharply down on 2023, the UNSA is far from complacent. In a statement it claimed that its members are facing \"work overload, insufficient salaries, lack of recognition and degraded working conditions. These legitimate concerns can no longer be ignored and it is time to get concrete answers from management.\" Disneyland Paris declined to comment as it said it is legally unable to do so at this stage of the negotiations.\nThe process is a world away from the one open to employees at Disneyland in California. Earlier this year Disney offered them an average increase of less than a dollar per year which was only improved after they threatened to strike. Their new deal gives them at least $24 per hour but, unlike in France, it is locked in for three years so it will be some time before they can demand more.\nWorkers at Walt Disney World in Orlando are even worse off as their latest pay rise only gave them $18 per hour, let alone a share in the profits of the parks.\nHowever, a happy ending could still be far, far away for the workers at Disneyland Paris. Following today's talks, the UNSA said that \"we remain unsatisfied, the management still has very traditional, and insufficient, vision.\" It added \"we are wondering about the real intention of negotiating. Or is the process already decided and tied up? What is the point of engaging in a pseudo-negotiation?\"\nThe outcome is far from certain as there is no pressure of strikes or soaring inflation like last year. The workers are heading into the unknown and although there is only one day of talks left, they still have everything to play for.\nCaroline Reid Following",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nBillie Lourd is honoring her late mother , the iconic actress and writer Carrie Fisher , on the seventh anniversary of her passing. Lourd took to Instagram to share an old childhood photo showing the two of them on the beach. The photo was accompanied by a heartfelt and emotional caption.\n\"It has been 7 years since my mom died (but who’s counting?? Me I guess?) Every anniversary brings a different iteration of my grief,\" Lourd wrote. \"Some infuse me with rage, some make me cry all day long, some make me feel dissociated and empty, some make me feel nothing, some make me feel guilty for feeling nothing, and some make me feel all of those things all at once.\"\nThe American Horror Story star continued, \"This year when I woke up I felt grateful - or ✨griefull✨if you will. Grief has infused my life with a sense of appreciation I had never had before. It makes me soak up every moment of joy as if it were my last. Today I was holding my daughter while she was napping in my arms and my eyes welled up with tears of joy. I laughed at myself then cried more cause I was laughing. I felt my mombys presence like the warmth of the sun on your skin on a hot summer day. The kind of warmth where you unknowingly close your eyes and take a slow breath through your nose and grin. I miss her every day but the cliche is also true - she is with me every day - she infuses my joyful moments with even more joy.\"\nFisher passed away on December 27th, 2016 at the age of 60 after suffering a heart attack on a plane. Just one day later, her mother, actress Debbie Reynolds , passed away as well .\nLourd concluded her moving tribute to her late mother by continuing to talk about her son , Kingston Fisher Lourd Rydell . \"As I tell my son, she lives in the stars - and she damn sure makes my life sparkle,\" she wrote. \"Sending my love to all my griefers out there. And hoping everyone can feel a little sparkle of griefull among all the feelings grief inevitably brings. ❤️\"",

    "text": "Govrenment signs peace pact with ULFA; Amit Shah says big day for Assam New Delhi: The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) on Friday signed a peace accord with the central and Assam governments, agreeing to shun violence, disband the organisation and join the democratic process. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present along with Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the signing of the accord here, said it was a very big day for the people of Assam. \"Assam has suffered for long due to the violence of the ULFA and 10,000 people lost their lives in this violence since 1979,\" he said. Shah said the ULFA, the oldest insurgent group of Assam, agreed to abjure violence, disband the organisation and join the democratic process. He said a big development package will be given to Assam as part of the accord. Every clause of the pact will be implemented fully, he said. He said that now violence has come down in Assam by 87 per cent, deaths by 90 per cent and kidnappings by 84 per cent. The chief minister termed the accord \"historic\" and said it has fructified due to the guidance and leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Shah. The accord came after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, and the government, officials said. The peace pact is expected to end decades-old insurgency in Assam. However, the hardline faction of ULFA, headed by Paresh Baruah, is not a part of the agreement. Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border. The ULFA was formed in 1979 with the demand for a \"sovereign Assam\". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990. The Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011 after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between the ULFA, central and state governments.",

That means the final 29 games of the regular season will be huge for Milwaukee as they try to land a top-4 seed and a homecourt advantage in the first round — and to avoid falling to sixth and having to face the Knicks or (less likely) the Celtics. The Bucks are already a team that is lacking a bit in the depth department, but they will now have to navigate much of the second half of the regular season without a key contributor.",

    "text": "En medio de un escenario económico desafiante, la empresa Genomma Lab anunció una fuerte apuesta por el mercado argentino. La compañía, una de las principales del sector farmacéutico y de cuidado personal en América Latina, comunicó que invertirá US$50 millones en la Argentina a lo largo de los próximos tres años.\nEl desembolso estará enfocado en dos frentes clave: por un lado, la adquisición de marcas que complementen su portafolio —actualmente en evaluación— y por otro, el desarrollo de infraestructura productiva para sostener su crecimiento en el país. La inversión será financiada con utilidades previamente generadas en Argentina y que permanecían retenidas a causa de las restricciones cambiarias vigentes hasta días atrás.\nLeé también: Vista compró los activos de Petronas en Vaca Muerta y será la mayor productora de petróleo privada del país\nLa compañía mexicana, conocida por marcas de alto reconocimiento como Tafirol , Tío Nacho , Cicatricure y Suerox , entre otras, enmarcó esta decisión como un gesto de confianza hacia el rumbo que está tomando la economía bajo la administración de Javier Milei.\n“Ante la nueva fase del plan económico anunciado por el Gobierno, Genomma felicita al presidente Javier Milei y a su ministro de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, Federico Sturzenegger , por el avance del plan que, sin dudas, traerá prosperidad al pueblo argentino”, señalaron desde la empresa en un comunicado oficial.\nGenomma Lab refuerza su presencia en la Argentina con una reinversión de US$50 millones. (Foto: AdobeStock) El anuncio no es menor si se considera el contexto: se produjo a días de conocerse el nuevo acuerdo alcanzado con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) y la presentación de un paquete de reformas que apunta a reestructurar el Estado y liberar fuerzas productivas.\nCon presencia en Argentina desde 2007, Genomma Lab forma parte de un grupo empresarial que opera en 18 países y desarrolla productos de venta libre (OTC) y cuidado personal con fuerte impronta de marketing. Desde mediados del año pasado, la operación local está liderada por Marlene Vázquez Espinosa , quien asumió como gerente general con el objetivo de consolidar el negocio en el país.\nActualmente, el 100% de los productos que la firma comercializa en Argentina se elaboran mediante esquemas de producción tercerizada, lo cual permite flexibilidad operativa pero también impone la necesidad de fortalecer la red de proveedores locales , algo que la empresa buscaría impulsar con esta nueva etapa de inversión.\nSegún el balance financiero más reciente, la firma reportó en 2024 ingresos netos por 3201 millones de pesos mexicanos, lo que representó un crecimiento interanual del 62,4%.",

'I do think it’s counterproductive to call her stupid,' he told me. Trump has rejected his team’s advice.
