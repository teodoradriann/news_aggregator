    "text": "Rescuers pulled three more crew members and a security guard alive from the Red Sea on Thursday, maritime security sources said, a day after Houthi militants sank the Greek ship Eternity C and said they were holding some of the crew still missing.\\nIt was the second Greek bulk carrier sunk this week by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia, shattering months of relative calm off Yemen’s coast, the gateway to the Red Sea and a critical route for oil and commodities to the world.\\nMany shipping companies have suspended voyages due to the fear of attack. The Houthis are believed to be holding six of the Eternity C’s complement of 22 crew and three guards, maritime security sources said.\\nEternity C was first hit on Monday with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speedboats.\\nOn Thursday, the Greek operator of the vessel, Cosmoship Management, confirmed that so far 10 people have been rescued – eight Filipino crew members, one Indian and one Greek security guard. Ten remain unaccounted for, including one guard, it said.\\nOne person is believed dead and another four have not been seen since the attack on the ship, the company added.\\nIf confirmed, the casualties would be the first fatalities in the area since June 2024.\\n\\nThe crew were forced to jump into the water, following a second attack on the vessel on Tuesday morning. Rescuers have been searching for survivors since Wednesday morning. The four people rescued on Thursday morning had spent nearly 48 hours in the water.\\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis’ military spokesperson said in a televised address that the Yemeni navy had “responded to rescue a number of the ship’s crew, provide them with medical care, and transport them to a safe location”.\\nThe United States Mission to Yemen has accused the Houthis of kidnapping crew members and has called for their immediate, unconditional safe release.\\n“We understand that the Houthis have picked up some people and we are working through multiple channels as a matter of priority to verify this information,” Cosmoship Management said.\\nRescuers are continuing their search, said Cosmoship, which has asked vessels passing in the area to assist in that effort.\\nEternity C had delivered a cargo for the UN World Food Program to Berbera, Somalia, and was sailing in ballast condition to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for fuel at the time of the first attack on Monday, the operator said.\\nThe vessel went down on Wednesday, days after Houthis hit and sank the Magic Seas, reviving a campaign launched in November 2023 that has seen more than 100 ships attacked in what the group said was solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza war.\\nBoth of the vessels hit this week flew Liberian flags and were operated by Greek companies. All crew from the Magic Seas were rescued before it sank.\\nSome of their sister vessels in the respective fleets had made calls to Israeli ports in the past year, an analysis of shipping data showed.\\n“These are blameless victims who were simply doing their job,” the UK-based Seafarers’ Charity association said.\\n“Seafarers should be able to work safely at sea. Instead, they are being unfairly forced into the firing line.”\\n\\n\\nAbdul Malik al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen’s Houthi fighters, reiterated in a televised address on Thursday the group’s ban on companies transporting goods related to Israel through the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.\\nHe said this week’s attacks were part of that ban, which has been in place since 2023.\\n“It was never stopped or cancelled, and it is a valid decision,” he said. “What was discovered [this week] was the violation by some companies of the decision.”\\nThe insurance cost of shipping goods through the Red Sea has more than doubled since this week’s attacks, with some underwriters pausing cover for some voyages, industry sources said on Thursday.\\nThe number of daily sailings through the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, at the southern tip of the Red Sea and a gateway to the Gulf of Aden, was 32 vessels on July 9, down from 43 on July 1, Lloyd’s List Intelligence data showed.\\nSeveral ships on Thursday broadcast messages referring to Chinese crew and management or armed guards on board, according to MarineTraffic data. One vessel broadcast that it had no relation with Israel.\\n",

    "title": "Central Oregon gravel routes to ride this fall or in spring",
    "text": "Gravel riding has become a popular alternative to the past decades’ “opposing sides” — mountain and road — of the bike world, as well as a money-making expansion by the bike industry. With most gravel bikes — and cyclocross bikes — able to perform considerably well on pavement, good “gravel” routes and races often include a mixture of paved, gravel and dirt roads. Some may even have tame singletrack.\nWhen compared to other places in the Pacific Northwest and on the West Coast, Central Oregon’s road bike riding is limited. There are nice road rides from Bend, but little variation. Narrow, lonely, winding roads are rare. But what the area lacks in road options it makes up for in its gravel options.\nFrom Bend, you can head in any direction and get to gravel or dirt roads worth riding in 20-30 minutes. I typically head west on a normal day out, but over the past month I ventured out to a couple of routes no more than an hour and 20-minute drive away.\nThanks to Dirty Freehub for the inspiration, detailed routes and maps. For more gravel rides statewide and all over the West, check out their website, dirtyfreehub.org.\nWhychus Canyon\nI rode this loop on a Monday when I had little time to spare. For the sake of efficiency, I started the route backwards as most of the gravel is in the second half of the loop. With luck on my side, despite a lack of preparation, this would turn out to be one of my more astute decisions.\nThe route starts from downtown Sisters and heads north on Camp Polk Road before heading east. After some lollygagging to avoid riding on McKenzie Highway too much, it eventually turns north onto Goodrich Road before taking a right onto Edmunson Road and a slight left onto Holmes Road, where there’s a decent stretch of open road and no navigating. About 18 miles in, take a left onto Forest Road 6360, where the main gravel section begins. The road drops down into Whychus Canyon and toward Whychus Creek, which you will have to cross 23.5 miles into the route.\nWhen I did the reverse route in the last full week of September, the water level was too high to cross without getting wet. So bring some plastic bags to cover your shoes, an extra pair of socks or be prepared to strip them off to wade across. I turned around and headed back to the car. Luckily, I had already added some cool miles to the north after missing a turn earlier.\nAfter the creek crossing, the route winds up a rocky climb out of the canyon and through a forest burned in the Grandview Fire in July of 2021. Take a left onto Forest Road 63 (this was the turn I missed in the opposite direction) — for more miles, bang a right and double-back when you’ve had enough. Road 63 becomes Tai Flat Road before merging into Wilt Road. Heading southwest, Wilt Road becomes paved before turning in Camp Polk Road and rolling back into downtown Sisters.\nThe full loop is 38 miles with 2,100 feet of climbing. It’s 40% gravel.\nSunriver loop\nThis is a convenient option for Bend residents who wish to ride from their house. About a 40-mile lollipop loop with plenty of variations and a stop in Sunriver possible, this route utilizes Deschutes National Forest roads and trails.\nTake the Cascade Highlands Trail to Forest Service Road 4606 to National Forest Development Road 4604. From 4604, take it out to Southwest Century Drive or wind your way through the forest on COD Alternative and Ticket to Ride trails to the Cascade Lakes Welcome Station. Then cross Century Drive and hop on Conklin Road, National Forest Road 41.\nAfter a few miles, it will turn into gravel and you can take it all the way to Spring River Road out of Sunriver. Other options include jumping on Afternoon Delight at Tyler’s Traverse Trailhead or taking the Deschutes River Trail and various trails and roads along the Deschutes River. Cross the river at Cardinal Landing Bridge to make a stop in Sunriver.\nI took Forest Road 200, off of Conklin, back. It will briefly turn into a trail along the river before opening back up onto a forest road that can take you back out to Conklin. I finished with 40 miles and nearly 2,400 feet of climbing. Looking for more singletrack? Dirty Freehub has a similar route that is 25% singletrack and 35% gravel.\nBlack Butte\nThis is a popular 33-mile loop that starts from downtown Sisters and includes smooth, easy singletrack. Another lollipop loop, it’s 65% singletrack and 35% gravel or dirt road with 1,700 feet of climbing.\nStarting from downtown Sisters, take North Pine Street to Sisters Tie Trail, cross Indian Ford Road and continue on Lower Butte Loop. Then take Forest Road 1105 to Forest Road 1430 to Forest Road 1120 to Green Ridge Trailhead. Hop on the Green Ridge Trail heading south and turn left on Upper Butte Loop, taking it back to Forest Road 1105 via switchbacks on the south end of Black Butte. Then follow the way out back into town.\nWith fun, winding trails, this route also has spectacular views through the trees of the Three Sisters, Three Fingered Jack and the rest of the Cascade Range.\nBig Summit Prairie\nProbably my favorite, this route circumnavigates privately-owned Big Summit Prairie and climbs through the beautiful and remote Ochoco National Forest. I parked in a small lot near Lookout Mountain Lower Trailhead, about a 75-minute drive from Bend, and rolled up Ochoco Creek Road to Old Ochoco Highway, where the route starts up a paved, winding 8-mile climb.\nBefore the 5-mile mark, turn onto Howard Creek Road. Keep climbing past Walton Lake and Round Mountain Trailhead until the road starts to descend and turns into gravel. Forest Road 22 will traverse the northern ridge of the prairie. Just after 21 miles in, there’s a right turn onto Forest Road 3010, the last gravel section. That empties out onto Forest Road 42, which heads along the south edge of the prairie and up the final climb where it becomes Canyon Creek Road before turning into Ochoco Creek Road shortly before getting to the parking lot. For some additional climbing and a view, there’s an extra gravel section up a forest road on top of the final climb at Round Mountain South Trailhead.\nI finished with just over 50 miles and 4,000 feet of climbing. I’m looking forward to heading back out in the spring, when the flowers are in bloom.\nOther options\nSome of my favorite rides are using sections of known routes to explore other trails in the area. Two gravel races this month, The Big Lonely and Ashes to Glory, out of Madras, are perfect routes for this. If you live in Bend, various meandering can be done through Deschutes National Forest roads, around Tumalo Reservoir and beyond.\nwww.bendbulletin.com/subscribe-now.",

    "title": "Zayn Malik Gets Rare 'Iron Man' Comic from Stan Lee, Courtesy of Morgan Spurlock",
    "text": "Zayn Malik, the former One Direction star, recently shared an anecdote that spotlights a unique piece of memorabilia in his collection - a rare 'Iron Man' comic book, personally signed by the legendary Stan Lee. This coveted item was a gift from Morgan Spurlock, the acclaimed documentarian behind the One Direction film 'This Is Us', as a token of appreciation at the end of their collaboration. Malik's revelation has not only made him the envy of comic book enthusiasts but also brought to light the special bond he shared with Spurlock and Lee.\nAdvertisment Behind the Gift The backstory of how Malik came to possess such a prized item is as fascinating as the gift itself. Spurlock, known for his documentary work, including a piece on Comic-Con that featured Stan Lee, chose to give Malik something that resonated with his interests. The 'Pillowtalk' singer's passion for comic books made the early edition of the 'Iron Man' comic the perfect choice. This gesture speaks volumes about Spurlock's thoughtfulness and the unique relationship he had with the members of One Direction, particularly Malik.\nJealous Bandmates and a Geeky Circle Advertisment According to Malik, the gift did stir some envy among his One Direction bandmates, who were left wishing they had received equally impressive parting gifts. This anecdote adds a layer of humor and camaraderie to the story, showcasing the dynamics within the band. Furthermore, Malik's admission of using the comic to brag among his circle of geeky, nerdy friends' who are avid comic book fans adds a relatable charm to his celebrity persona, bridging the gap between him and his fans over shared interests.\nA Look into the Future While the comic book remains a treasured item in Malik's collection, the singer is also making headlines with his professional endeavors. His announcement of the upcoming album 'Room Under the Stairs', set to release on May 17, has fans eagerly anticipating what Malik describes as a project offering deeper insight into his personal experiences and emotions. The lead single ' What I Am ' promises a glimpse into the raw, unfiltered essence of Malik's artistry, ensuring that his fans remain closely connected to his journey, both past and present.\nAs Malik continues to weave his narrative through music and personal stories, his unique memorabilia, like the 'Iron Man' comic, serves as a reminder of the diverse experiences that shape an artist. From cherished gifts to new musical ventures, Malik's journey is a testament to the evolving relationship between celebrities and their fans, underscored by shared passions and the human experiences that resonate with us all.",

    "text": "West Virginia State University is excited to introduce a transformative scholarship program for its elementary education majors, thanks to the generous support of the John and Ruth McGee Foundation. Over the next five years, the foundation will provide $500,000 , $100,000 each year, to support high-need students pursuing careers in public education.\nDr Kerri Steele is the College of Professional Studies dean at WVSU. She emphasized the profound impact this scholarship can have on students’ educational journeys. “The McGee Foundation Scholarship will be life-changing for the students who receive it,” she stated.\n“Most of our students juggle their studies with the need to work, but as they advance in the program, this becomes more challenging. They face competency exams at key milestones, rigorous experiential learning requirements, and ultimately, full-time residency placement in their final year. The McGee Foundation Scholarship is designed to provide increased support as students progress in their studies, freeing them from financial concerns so that they can focus fully on preparing to become the qualified, dedicated teachers our West Virginia children depend on.”\nThe scholarship is targeted specifically at high-need individuals from West Virginia. Scholarships will be allocated based on demonstrated financial need after all federal and state aid options have been exhausted. The funds can be utilized to cover tuition costs, praxis exam fees, and other necessary expenses related to obtaining an elementary education degree and teaching licensure.\nPreference will be given to scholarship applicants who express a commitment to teaching in West Virginia upon graduation. The first round of scholarships will be awarded starting in the fall semester of 2025.\nWVSU boasts a well-respected teacher education program that has been continuously accredited since 1963. In recent years, the university has successfully placed 51 graduates into public school teaching roles across 14 counties in West Virginia.",

    "title": "Seattle-area entrepreneur files trademark lawsuit against Kraken over Winter Classic jerseys",
    "text": "When the Seattle Kraken unveiled their 2024 NHL Winter Classic uniforms, they were met with positive feedback. However, one Seattle-area entrepreneur has filed a trademark lawsuit against the Kraken due to the jersey’s resemblance to that of the now-defunct Seattle Metropolitans, per a report from the Seattle Times.\nThe Metropolitans were founded in 1915 as a member of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, and they won the Stanley Cup in 1917. Seven years later, in 1924, the team folded and Seattle went without a hockey team for almost 100 years.\nPaul Kim purchased the trademark rights to the Metropolitans’ name, logo, and colors in 2014. He used that to sell throwback merchandise, and Kim even had a relationship with the Kraken when the team entered the NHL in 2021.\nHowever, according to the report from the Times, that relationship cratered when the Kraken and Kim engaged in negotiations about using the Metropolitans’ design for the 2024 Winter Classic jerseys. In the suit, Kim accuses the NHL franchise of making “low-ball” offers for licensing rights.\nEven when those talks fizzled out, the Kraken went ahead with a Winter Classic jersey design that incorporates a lot of elements from the Metropolitans’ logo and uniforms. The Kraken’s sweater bears a big red “S” with lettering running through it, which Kim says is “virtually identical” to the Metropolitans’ primary logo. The Winter Classic uniform also imitates the Metropolitans’ old uniforms by incorporating big horizontal stripes throughout.\nIn the lawsuit, Kim claims to have lost $2.5 million as a result of the Kraken using a design similar to the Metropolitans for their Winter Classic jersey. He will be seeking at least that amount in damages from the Kraken ownership.\nA Kraken spokesperson released a statement on the lawsuit to the Times.\n“We are aware of the filing and are working with our lawyers to respond. We cannot comment further on an active legal matter. Our focus is on delivering an incredible NHL Winter Classic experience for our fans and celebrating outdoor hockey together,” the statement read.",

    "title": "In Nigeria and Much of Africa, Catholic Same-Sex Couples See No Blessings Soon",
    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much.\n\"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n\"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said.\n\"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\"\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Africa , Christianity , Sao Tome and Principe , Nigeria\nRead More",

    "text": "A group of chemical compounds used to disinfect water for one-third of the US population and millions of others globally produces a potentially toxic byproduct, according to new research published Thursday, sparking calls for an \"immediate\" investigation into possible health impacts.\nInorganic chloramines have been used for decades to remove pathogens from public water supplies.\nThough chlorine remains the most widely used disinfectant in the US and globally, chloramines have increasingly replaced it in many systems to reduce certain byproducts linked to bladder and colon cancer, low birth weight, and miscarriage.\nToday, more than 113 million Americans rely on chloraminated drinking water, with the compound also in use across Canada, Asia, and Europe.\n\"However, chloramines themselves decompose into products that are poorly characterized,\" said Julian Fairey, lead author of the study published in the journal Science, during a press briefing.\nOne such product, identified more than 40 years ago but left chemically unresolved, was simply dubbed the \"unidentified product.\"\nFairey and his team have finally cracked the mystery.\nUsing a combination of traditional chemistry methods and modern tools like high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, they identified the compound as \"chloronitramide anion.\"\nMore from this section Bragg suggests suspending Trump's hush money sentencing, perhaps for 4 years Five tourists dead after suspected tainted alcohol poisoning in Laos UN nuclear chief welcomes Iran's 'concrete step' on uranium stockpile The compound was detected in all 40 chloraminated drinking water samples tested, with concentrations reaching up to 100 micrograms per liter -- exceeding typical regulatory limits for disinfection byproducts, which range between 60 and 80 micrograms per liter.\nAlthough toxicological studies have yet to be conducted, the researchers sounded a warning.\n\"The chemical structure looks concerning, as does the concentrations at which this compound is forming, so we certainly think health effects studies are warranted,\" Fairey said.\nTheir study calls for the compound to be \"an immediate candidate\" for quantification in public waters and for closer health and toxicity studies.\nWater utilities could consider reverting to chlorine, Fairey suggested, though this would require secondary disinfectants to neutralize the known toxic byproducts chlorine produces.\nWith further study and regulatory action likely years away, the researchers recommended home filtration systems using activated carbon blocks for people who are concerned.\nia/aha\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",
