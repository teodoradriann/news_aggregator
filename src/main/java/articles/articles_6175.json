The Grammy Award winner has released SaveNasX.com , a very '90s-style website promoting his new work that features a clock counting the time since his debut studio album Montero dropped in 2021. \"LIL NAS X hasn't released an album in over two years,\" reads a blurb on the page. \"This site is dedicated to finding him and saving him by turning his heart toward Christ's light!\" It further reads, \"Has the DEVIL-WORSHIPPING pop-artist finally been sacrificed to HIS MASTER? WHY is he SECLUDING HIMSELF???? What is he PREPARING FOR? This site will answer ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND MORE!!!... We will find Montero, and WE WILL SAVE HIM BY RETURNING HIS HEART TO J.CHRIST'S LIGHT \" Lil Nas X's latest publicity stunt comes after he made waves with his 2021 music video for \" Montero (Call Me By Your Name) ,\" which saw him riding a pole down to Hell and giving Satan a lap dance. The \"Industry Baby\" artist has since teased fans that he plans to release Christian music next. \"Y'all mind if I enter my Christian era?\" he wrote last month, sharing a taste of a potential new spiritual song.

    "text": "A warm, dry spring has U.S. forecasters worried about the upcoming wildfire season Most of the United States is expected to see warmer-than-average temperatures this spring, federal forecasters say, with dry conditions likely in the West. That's raising concerns about wildfires, especially in parts of the Southwest, Great Plains, and the Upper Mississippi River Valley, said Jon Gottschalck, operations branch chief at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. The southern High Plains, in particular, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, is going to be \"quite vulnerable to high wildfire risk, especially during high wind events,\" Gottschalck said Thursday on a call with reporters. Texas recently suffered the largest wildfire in the state's history, which investigators [say was started by power lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/texas-smokehouse-creek-fire-xcel-energy.html). In the Mid-Atlantic this week, high winds [helped fuel blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/virginia-wv-wildfires.html) in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. NOAA [released its Spring Outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/spring-outlook-warmer-for-most-of-us-wetter-in-southeast) amid a stretch of record warm weather. Last month was the [hottest February on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-warmest-february-on-record), and 2023 was the [hottest year ever](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221827923/2023-hottest-year-record-climate-change). High average temperatures last year were exacerbated by a strong El Niño climate pattern, which is a [natural cycle](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186098964/with-el-nino-and-climate-change-this-week-saw-some-of-the-hottest-recorded-weath) that heats water in the Pacific Ocean and raises average temperatures worldwide. Gottschalck said the effects of the current El Niño are expected to weaken through the spring. But recent heat records are part of a longer warming trend that scientists expect to continue as climate change intensifies. Global temperatures are rising because of the accumulation of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, [according to the World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that,ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record.), which is part of the United Nations. Those greenhouse gasses come from humans burning fossil fuels. \"Climate change is affecting the timing, intensity, and duration of weather events in the United States,\" Rick Spinrad, NOAA's administrator, said in a news release. Forecasters also warned of low water levels on the Mississippi River this summer because of below-average snowpack and precipitation in the Northern Plains and the Midwest. Ed Clark, director of the National Water Center, said low-flow conditions could affect navigation on the entire Mississippi River system, as well as water supplies for communities and industries. NOAA doesn't expect major flooding anywhere in the country this spring. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

El foc està estabilitzat des d'ahir, i s'ha treballat des d'aleshores per aconseguir arribar a la fase de control. Avui s'ha estès el sistema de línies d'aigua per poder-ho rematar bé i s'ha trobat una gran quantitat de biomassa. Ha calgut fer maniobres d'obertura de caixa amb eines manuals per accedir a les zones més frondoses. Durant el dia hi han treballat 28 dotacions i un centenar d'efectius, però aquesta nit es preveu reduir notablement l'operatiu.\nVeïns de la Llavinera: \"Sembla que el vent bufa cap a una altra banda, però no estem gens tranquils\"\nACN\nSobre l'origen del foc, el cos d'Agents Rurals treballa amb la hipòtesi que el foc es va originar durant les tasques de recol·lecció del cereal. Així ho explicava aquest migdia el cap de l'àrea regional de la Catalunya Central dels Agents Rurals, Jordi Carrasco, que detallava que durant les tasques d'investigació que van fer dimarts van determinar que l'àrea d'inici del foc se situava en un camp de cereals. \"Vam trobar una màquina que havia estat treballant i que accidentalment va originar l'incendi\", assegura.\nEl foc va obligar a confinar ahir masies disseminades de tres municipis de la zona de l'incendi durant unes hores, fins que es va aconseguir estabilitzar el foc i es van poder aixecar les mesures restrictives.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\nLa Generalitat posa en marxa un pla per potenciar la ramaderia extensiva\nLa Generalitat posa en marxa un pla per potenciar la ramaderia extensiva\nLa Generalitat posa en marxa un pla per potenciar la ramaderia extensiva",

    "text": "El Ayuntamiento de París, a través de su teniente de alcalde Pierre Rabadan, ha asegurado este jueves que el Sena es \"apto para nadar\" y ha tranquilizado así a entrenadores y deportistas sobre las condiciones sanitarias y la contaminación del río, a menos de un mes para que empiecen los Juegos Olímpicos en la capital francesa. Así lo constató el medio de comunicación francés RMC Sport. Aplazado por el contexto de las elecciones legislativas y también por la dudosa calidad del agua, el baño de la alcaldesa parisina Anne Hidalgo en el Sena \"aún podría celebrarse antes del inicio\" de esos JJ.OO., cuya ceremonia inaugural está programada para el 26 de julio. Según Rabadan, exjugador de rugby y actual teniente de alcalde y máximo responsable de Deportes en el Ayuntamiento, será posible nadar en el Sena pese a los recientes temores sobre el grado de contaminación por la bacteria Escherichia coli. \"Los resultados de los últimos días son satisfactorios y coherentes con la natación\", afirmó al respecto. \"Sabíamos por qué no se debía a las fuertes lluvias que tuvimos en mayo y junio. Ahora los resultados de la calidad del agua son consistentes con nuestras necesidades\", añadió Rabadan, quien dijo que las competiciones de natación en aguas abiertas y de triatlón podrán desarrollarse según lo previsto por los organizadores de los JJ.OO. \"Obviamente, los próximos días deben continuar en esta dirección, pero no tengo preocupaciones\", comentó el teniente de alcalde parisino durante un evento en la Plaza de la Concordia. Antes de concluir, Rabadan hizo una promesa clara: \"Estaremos ahí para los JJ.OO.\".",
