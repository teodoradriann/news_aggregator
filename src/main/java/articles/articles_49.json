    "text": "Baked Chicken Legs are about to be on your short list for weeknight dinners! With a sweet and smoky rub, tender and juicy meat, and delightfully crispy skin, these chicken legs are sure to be on frequent repeat.\nWhy You’ll Love This Crispy Baked Chicken Legs Recipe\n- Tender and Juicy Chicken, Every Time. While most of us rely on chicken breasts for easy meals (ahem,\nBaked Chicken Breast), don’t sleep on chicken legs! Unlike chicken breasts, baked chicken legs are very forgiving and hard to get wrong. No dry, rubbery chicken here!\n- Easy to Make. We’re talking 10 minutes of prep time! I love a low effort main dish because it leaves me time to make a side dish or two. (\nSweet Potato Wedgesare especially good with these crispy baked chicken legs.)\n- So Versatile. Master the basics of this recipe and the oven is your oyster. Add your favorite herbs and spices to put your own spin on it, or marinate the chicken legs with my\nChicken Marinadebeforehand for flavor throughout.\n- The Most Budget-Friendly Chicken. Chicken legs are the least expensive cut of chicken, so if you’re trying to stretch your grocery budget, this recipe is a delicious way to do it. With the crispy skin and juicy meat, you won’t feel like you’re pinching pennies with this dinner! (If you’re in search of more ways to save money on your groceries, make these\nAir Fryer Chicken Legsnext.)\nHow to Make Baked Chicken Legs\nThe Ingredients\n- Bone-In, Skin-On Chicken Legs/Drumsticks. Whole chicken legs contain the thigh and drumstick; they are fattier than chicken breasts, which means they’re also much more flavorful. We usually roast the drumstick only, as they are easier to find.\n- Extra-Virgin Olive Oil. For that perfect crispy skin.\n- Light Brown Sugar. To help the skin caramelize.\n- Seasonings. Smoked paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder, and the always essential kosher salt and black pepper. Add cayenne if you want a kick in your baked chicken legs.\n- Chopped Fresh Cilantro or Green Onion. Optional, for a pop of color and fresh flavor.\nThe Directions\n- Prepare. Pat the chicken legs dry, then place them in a large bowl and drizzle with oil.\n- Make the Seasoning. Mix all the ingredients together.\n- Season the Chicken. Add the seasoning to the bowl and toss to coat. Start preheating the oven to 425 degrees F.\n- Cook. Place the chicken in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake chicken legs for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the baked chicken legs reach 165 degrees F. Rest for a few minutes, then serve and ENJOY.\nRecipe Variations\n- Sweet and Savory Baked Chicken Legs. Use my\nChicken Thigh Marinadeto add extra flavor to this recipe.\n- Orange Chicken Legs. If you love my\nHealthy Orange Chicken, try oven-baked chicken legs with this Orange Chicken Marinade.\n- Honey Garlic Baked Chicken Legs. The honey garlic marinade from these honey garlic\nChicken Wingsrecipe is also fantastic with chicken legs.\n- Cajun Air Fryer Chicken Legs. Instead of the spice blend in this recipe, rub the chicken legs with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning.\nStorage Tips\n- To Store. Refrigerate leftover baked chicken legs in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days.\n- To Reheat. Gently rewarm the chicken legs on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\n- To Freeze. Freeze leftovers in an airtight, freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating according to the instructions above.\nWhat to Serve with Baked Chicken Legs\n- Coleslaw. This\nHealthy Coleslawis always a favorite, as is my Asian Slaw.\n- Potato Salad. You can’t go wrong with sweet and smoky baked chicken legs alongside\nSweet Potato Salad, Healthy Potato Salad, or Pesto Potato Salad.\n- Macaroni and Cheese. These easy baked chicken legs feel like the kind of down-home dinner you’d serve up with a side of\nInstant Pot Mac and Cheese(or Butternut Squash Mac and Cheesefor something different!).\n- Vegetable Sides. You can also keep it light and healthy with sides like\nSmashed Brussels Sprouts, Sautéed Green Beans, and Roasted Frozen Broccoli.\nRecommended Tools to Make this Recipe\nMeasuring Spoons. My absolute favorite measuring spoons! They’re stackable for easy storage. Instant Read Thermometer. The best way to know when chicken reaches a safe internal temperature. Rimmed Baking Sheet. If you’re due for a replacement, these baking sheets are pretty and high quality.\nRecipe Tips and Tricks\n- Dry the Chicken Well. Before making these oven-baked chicken chicken legs, make sure to pat them dry with paper towels. This will help the chicken brown evenly and prevent excess moisture from steaming the meat. It’s key to that irresistible crispy skin!\n- Use a Meat Thermometer. To ensure that your chicken is fully cooked and safe to eat, it’s important to use a\nmeat thermometer. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 degrees F. Unlike chicken breasts, though, you can continue to cook the chicken beyond the 165 degree mark—in fact, it will get even more tender and juicy with a little extra time in the oven, as the collagen begins to break down at 185 degrees F.\n- Don’t Forget to Line the Baking Sheet. Your future self will thank you! For easy clean-up, line your baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil before placing the chicken legs on top.\n- Let the Chicken Rest Before Serving. Once the chicken is done baking, let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute and results in a more tender and flavorful chicken.\nBaked Chicken Legs\nIngredients\n- 8 to 10 bone-in, skin-on chicken legs/drumsticks (about 2 1/2 pounds)\n- 2 tablespoons\nextra-virgin olive oil\n- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar dark works too\n- 2 teaspoons\nsmoked paprika\n- 1 teaspoon\nground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon\ngarlic powder\n- 1 teaspoon\nkosher salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon\nblack pepper\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper optional\n- Chopped fresh cilantro or green onion optional for serving\nInstructions\n- Pat the chicken legs dry with paper towels, and place them in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle with the oil.\n- In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, smoked paprika, cumin, garlic, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sprinkle over the chicken, then toss to evenly coat. Let stand at room temperature while you preheat the oven, or refrigerate for up to 1 day.\n- Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 425°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or a double layer of parchment paper.\n- Arrange the drumsticks in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake chicken legs for 30-35 minutes, or until the internal temperature is at least 165°F when a meat thermometer is inserted in the thickest part of the meat without touching bone; unlike Baked Chicken Breast, you don’t need to worry about pulling legs a few degrees early for resting time; up to 200°F will be fine. Let rest a few minutes, then serve hot sprinkled with cilantro or green onion.\nNotes\n- If you have white meat fans, you cut a large bone-in, skin on chicken breast (also called split chicken breast) in half crosswise (really wiggle the knife to break the rib bones) and roast it along with the legs; they will cook in about the same amount of time.\n- Adapted from my\nAir Fryer Chicken Legs\n- TO STORE: Refrigerate leftover baked chicken legs in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days.\n- TO REHEAT: Gently rewarm the chicken legs on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\n- TO FREEZE: Freeze leftovers in an airtight, freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months.

    "title": "Worried about hacked SSNs? Here’s how to protect yourself and freeze credit - The Washington Post",
    "text": "A major dealer of personal background information confirmed that it had lost control of Social Security numbers and other sensitive data Friday, recommending that consumers put fraud alerts on their files at the biggest credit bureaus and keep a close watch on their financial accounts. NPD acknowledged there had been a “security incident,\" saying a third party was “trying to hack into data” in December and that “potential leaks” popped up in April and August. The company said it conducted its own investigation into the incident and that “subsequent information has come to light,\" though it didn’t share what that information was. NPD said it has cooperated with law enforcement, improved security and would update on further developments. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment. NPD did not say how many people were at risk, but companies like it have records on virtually all Americans. Unlike rules governing credit records, there are few regulations for the hundreds in the data-broker industry, which deals in email and street addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, likely relatives, and property and legal records. The most sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, are typically obscured, at least in part. Potential employers commonly search those sorts of data troves, but they are also valuable to retailers, marketers and people-search companies that advertise on the web to general users. Such brokers have also been the subject of past hacks and leaks. Criminal hackers have been offering what they claimed were billions of NPD records since April, though some security researchers who looked at the trove said some of the claims were exaggerated. The set is large enough to suggest some fake or reused data, security expert Troy Hunt told The Washington Post. Awareness of the issue rose after a lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed Aug. 1, as first reported by Bloomberg Law . The suit accuses NPD of failing to protect the personal information of consumers who have had no direct relationship with it. Posters in hacking forums claimed responsibility for the breach and offered to sell or share the data, which they said included information on people in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Some of the data has been made freely available, with millions of rows of data, some of which contain authentic names and Social Security numbers, multiple cybersecurity researchers told The Post. Still, the scale and severity of the alleged breach has been overstated in some reports, they said. It’s still unclear how much of the data is genuine and whether it all came from hacking, as opposed to scraping publicly available sources. Cybersecurity experts say this incident is par for the course as companies amass data on consumers. “Incidents like this should ideally stimulate a public conversation regarding the data aggregation industry,” said Robert Roccio, a threat analyst at cybersecurity company GroupSense. “It’s a massive business and it is worth considering whether these organizations are being responsible with the information they collect on ordinary Americans.” Rob Shavell, CEO at consumer security company DeleteMe, said his team hasn’t seen signs that a wave of new stolen data is hitting online markets. James E. Lee, chief operating officer at Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers deal with fraud, said that there is “nothing new” about this particular data haul and that SSNs already circulate online. “The steps you need to take today are the steps you needed to be taking for years,” Lee said. Here’s how to protect yourself as best you can against fraud and identity theft. Freeze your credit A credit freeze blocks any new lines of credit, so a bad actor couldn’t open new cards or accounts in your name. You can initiate a freeze without impacting your credit score. Just visit the websites of the three major credit reporting agencies Equifax , Experian and TransUnion . You might have to scroll down the page or click on one of the menu tabs at the top to find a “manage freeze” or “add a freeze” button. You’ll fill out a form and might get asked to set up an account of verify your identity — it this case go ahead and do so. You can pause or remove the freeze at will by going back to the website or by contacting the reporting agency by phone or mail . You can also create an online “My Social Security” account here and keep an eye out for flagged suspicious activity. Turn on two-factor authentication This is the thing that sends you a text message with a code as you log in. “Two factor” just means you need to authenticate your identity in multiple ways before accessing an account. Turning on two-factor authentication — either when you set up an account or later in the settings — is one of the best and easiest ways to keep accounts secure, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers deal with fraud. Still, many people skip this step. Always say “yes” to two-factor authentication, whether that’s through text messages, emails or a stand-alone authenticator app that asks “is that you?” every time you sign in. If you haven’t set up two-factor authentication, start with your most sensitive accounts such as banking and health care, Shavell said. Consider dark web monitoring Data brokers collect details about individuals to build profiles they sell to advertisers and even law enforcement . If your Social Security number turned up in a broker’s database, it would be hard to hunt down on your own. You can sign up for a service that monitors the web for your personal info and sends removal requests on your behalf. Revisit your password hygiene It’s 2024, and we’re not using the same password for multiple websites anymore. Each account you own should have a long, distinct password containing a mix of letters, numbers and special characters. Worried about remembering all those? Get a password manager such as Dashlane or 1Password, which automatically generate secure passwords and autofill them next time you log in. (Both of these products cost about the same as a Netflix subscription, but Apple and Google have their own free password managers that come with your operating system.) If you’re still refusing to use a password manager, try to keep your passwords free of personal information such as your pet’s name or your birthday — those make it easier for bad actors to guess, said Ginny Fahs, director of research and development at consumer advocacy nonprofit Consumer Reports. Don’t forget about visibility If you don’t mind making your social media accounts private, doing so can cut down on the personal information criminals can access. A bunch of public Facebook posts, for instance, could make it easier for a hacker to impersonate you in a phishing attack targeting one of your friends or family members. Don’t forget to check your privacy settings in apps such as Venmo and YouTube as well. Just last month, reporters at Wired found that the public Venmo transactions of vice-presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) provided a glimpse into the politician’s social connections. Delete accounts you don’t use Don’t just abandon accounts you don’t use any more — go ahead and delete them . It reduces the amount of personal info you have sitting online, such as an old Myspace account, and in some cases prevents companies from sharing or selling your data down the line. “If you’re no longer using that site, there’s no reason for that company to have your information,” Fahs said. In many cases, deleting your profile doesn’t mean the company has deleted the data it stores about you. But some states have privacy laws that require companies to honor a deletion request and purge your information from its servers. Consumer Reports made a tool called Permission Slip that lets you send multiple data deletion requests in one place.

    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.
