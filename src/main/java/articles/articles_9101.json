    "text": "Christian woman allegedly killed by her Muslim son for accepting Christ NAIROBI, Kenya — Before Sawuba Naigaga succumbed to injuries her 25-year-old son inflicted on her in Uganda this month, she described the assault to a friend from her hospital bed. The friend said Naigaga’s son, Ashirafu Basalirwa, returned home to Busia town, Busia district from four years of working in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 15 and found his mother mentioning the name of Jesus as she prayed. “As I was praying with my eyes closed, my son called me, saying ‘Mum, Mum — you are becoming a disgrace to the family and the religion of Allah,’” the 46-year-old Naigaga told her friend before she died on Dec. 17. “I kept quiet, and he pushed me hard to the wall, then I fell down. He then took a blunt object and hit me at the head. Since then, I lost all my consciousness, only to find myself in the hospital bed.” The friend said she had told Naigaga the Gospel and led her to Christ. “I preached the Good News of Jesus to Sawuba, who gave her life to Christ in 2022,” said the friend, whose name is withheld for security reasons. “We had been attending church. One thing which I know is that she kept her faith silent from her family members, including her son.” Basalirwa had gone to Saudi Arabia to look for employment after graduating from an Islamic university in Uganda, the friend said. She found Naigaga on the day of the assault. “I ran to Sawuba’s home after hearing wailing from her house and an alarm from neighbors,” the friend recalled. “I dashed quickly to the scene, and I found her in a pool of blood but in an unconscious state. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she breathed her last breath after two days on Dec. 17 due to internal bleeding.” Basalirwa has fled and is in hiding, sources said. Besides her son, Naigaga is survived by a daughter. The killing was the latest of [many](https://morningstarnews.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7ec6d7eb2533a90581f839110&id=95cd8d3618&e=d656281a7e) instances of persecution of Christians in Uganda that Morning Star News has documented.

    "text": "\"Il Papa chiede per l’Ucraina il coraggio del negoziato\"\nSalvatore Cernuzio – Città del Vaticano\nIl Papa con le sue parole sull'Ucraina ha inteso chiedere il cessate il fuoco e rilanciare il coraggio del negoziato. Il direttore della Sala Stampa, Matteo Bruni, risponde alle domande di alcuni giornalisti a proposito dell’anticipazione dell’intervista alla Radio Televisione Svizzera (RSI), pubblicata oggi, spiegando che l’auspicio di Francesco per il Paese, da sempre definito “martoriato”, è tutto racchiuso nelle parole già espresse all’Angelus del 25 febbraio, all’indomani del drammatico doppio anniversario dello scoppio del conflitto, in cui ribadiva il suo “vivissimo affetto” alla popolazione. E cioè di “creare le condizioni di una soluzione diplomatica alla ricerca di una pace giusta e duratura”.\n“Il Papa – specifica Bruni - usa il termine bandiera bianca, e risponde riprendendo l’immagine proposta dall’intervistatore, per indicare con essa la cessazione delle ostilità, la tregua raggiunta con il coraggio del negoziato. Altrove nell’intervista, parlando di un’altra situazione di conflitto, ma riferendosi a ogni situazione di guerra, il Papa ha affermato chiaramente: ‘Il negoziato non è mai una resa’”.\nNell’intervista in questione l’intervistatore Lorenzo Buccella domanda al Papa: “In Ucraina c’è chi chiede il coraggio della resa, della bandiera bianca. Ma altri dicono che così si legittimerebbe il più forte. Cosa pensa?”. E Francesco risponde: “È un’interpretazione. Ma credo che è più forte chi vede la situazione, chi pensa al popolo, chi ha il coraggio della bandiera bianca, di negoziare. E oggi si può negoziare con l'aiuto delle potenze internazionali. La parola negoziare è una parola coraggiosa. Quando vedi che sei sconfitto, che le cose non vanno, occorre avere il coraggio di negoziare. Hai vergogna, ma con quante morti finirà? Negoziare in tempo, cercare qualche Paese che faccia da mediatore. Oggi, per esempio nella guerra in Ucraina, ci sono tanti che vogliono fare da mediatore. La Turchia, si è offerta per questo. E altri. Non abbiate vergogna di negoziare prima che la cosa sia peggiore”.\nDunque, parole quelle del Papa riprese da una immagine proposta dall’intervistatore per ribadire, tra l’altro, quanto già affermato in questi due anni di continui appelli e pronunciamenti pubblici, ovvero l’importanza del dialogo contro la “follia” della guerra e la prioritaria preoccupazione per la sorte della popolazione civile. “L’auspicio del Papa – ribadisce infatti il portavoce vaticano - è e resta quello sempre ripetuto in questi anni, e ripetuto recentemente in occasione del secondo anniversario del conflitto: ‘Mentre rinnovo il mio vivissimo affetto al martoriato popolo ucraino e prego per tutti, in particolare per le numerosissime vittime innocenti, supplico che si ritrovi quel po’ di umanità che permetta di creare le condizioni di una soluzione diplomatica alla ricerca di una pace giusta e duratura’”.\nGrazie per aver letto questo articolo.

    "text": "Black Women in Entertainment (BWIE), which began as a mobilization effort for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign, has launched as a national network centered on supporting and connecting Black women in the entertainment industry, the organization announced Wednesday.\n“Today marks one year since I turned inspiration into action,” BWIE founder and communications strategist Evan Seymour, who previously served as the global publicity lead for Apple TV+, said in a social media statement. “After watching the historic Win With Black Women Zoom, I decided to bring together a few of my incredible entertainment industry friends to support then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to serve as leader of our country. We organized in a WhatsApp, and that WhatsApp grew from 10 women into hundreds mobilizing across the country in a matter of days.”\nEvan Seymour, founder of Black Women in Entertainment and ERS Communications (Photo courtesy of Black Women in Entertainment) Black Women in Entertainment (Photo courtesy of Black Women in Entertainment) Per a statement obtained by TheWrap, BWIE is an “evolution of ‘Black Women in Entertainment for Kamala’ — a 2024 election-year political collective that brought together more than 500 Black women in entertainment to mobilize voter education, support then-Vice President Kamala Harris and amplify Black women’s voices in media and politics.”\nPrevious supporters of Black Women in Entertainment for Kamala include Debra Martin Chase, Debbie Allen, Yvette Lee Bowser, Robin Thede and more.\nAs part of its new development, BWIE has a mission to uplift Black women in the industry through acts of service, including hosting virtual and in-person networking events, educational workshops and community-service initiatives. In addition, BWIE seeks to support mutual aid organizations and local grassroots efforts, and its members will offer one another resources in order to create opportunities for mentorship, creative collaboration and professional advancement.\nBlack Women in Entertainment organization (Photo courtesy of Black Women in Entertainment) “As powerful as that moment was, what remained after the election was even more important: community,” Seymour said in a Wednesday statement to media. “We wanted to continue building something that celebrated us — not just our labor or influence, but our ideas, joy and creativity.”\nShe continued: “The call to do something doesn’t end on Election Day. Now, we’re choosing to do something that centers us — our growth, our care and our collective brilliance.”",

    "text": "In a decisive move to combat the effects of a prolonged dry spell that has gripped more than half of its provinces, Zambia is taking proactive steps to ensure the nation's food security remains unthreatened. Announced by President Hakainde Hichilema, the adjustments to the national budget are a testament to the government's commitment to safeguarding its agricultural sector and, by extension, its population's livelihood. Amid these strategic financial shifts, an innovative event in Chongwe district has emerged as a beacon of hope and resilience for Zambian farmers.\nSeeds of Change: Empowering Farmers Against Climate Challenges\nIn the heart of Zambia's Chongwe district, an event organized by the Southern Africa Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative has showcased a groundbreaking approach to agricultural resilience. The seed fair, aimed at equipping local farmers with the tools and knowledge to combat the adverse effects of climate change, has brought into sharp focus the importance of adopting drought-tolerant and disease-resistant seed varieties. This initiative not only highlights the government's shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices but also underscores the critical need for innovation in ensuring food security in the face of changing environmental conditions.\nInnovative Solutions for Sustainable Agriculture\nAt the heart of the seed fair, diverse drought-tolerant and disease-resistant seeds were not the sole highlights. The event also served as a platform for educating farmers on best agricultural practices, soil health management, and effective pest control strategies. These educational sessions provided invaluable insights into how Zambian farmers can enhance their yields and sustainability, despite the challenging climatic conditions that have beset the region. The success of this fair is a vivid illustration of how collaborative efforts and knowledge-sharing can forge a path towards a more resilient agricultural ecosystem in Zambia.\nThe seed fair's success story is a testament to the power of collective action in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change to food security. By bringing together farmers, agricultural experts, and policymakers, the event fostered an environment of innovation and learning. This collaborative approach not only empowered farmers with the necessary tools and knowledge to thrive in a changing climate but also highlighted the importance of adaptive and resilient agricultural practices in securing Zambia's food supply.",

    "text": "DECATUR, ILL. (WAND) - Shemilah Outreach is no stranger to the Decatur community, and the man behind it all is like family to local youth. \"There are not many people like him that wants to make people better and bring up our generation,\" said Jamareon Singleton, member of Shemilah Outreach. Shemuel Sanders started his program in honor of his daughter Shemilah after she fell victim to gun violence. Now, Sanders is dedicated to guiding kids and teens down the right path. \"Sky is the limit. I tell the youth if they stay on the right path, stay out of trouble. Then they can do what they want to do, be who they want to be,\" said Shemuel Sanders. In 2023, Sander's goal was to expand, and that is exactly what he did. Along with adding various activity rooms in the outreach center. Including a teen room with a PS5 gaming system, a weight room and arcade games lined up and down the hall. He even added a computer lab, so his students can do homework before getting into any of the activities. \"You come here he'll feed you, give you a game system. Just make sure your home works done and be on the right track,\" said Zander Martin, program participant.

Each providing different outlets for students with different interests. \"We have different students; they have different ideals and different things that they want to do. I want to give them things they can chose from. Our violence prevention program, we have an awesome sports program, agriculture program, art program. So we have really grown,\" explained Sanders. With gun violence growing across the nation and in the community, Sanders is able to work closely with the youth who become impacted. \"Losing my cousin, that was a big impact on my life. Because just being there, seeing it happen. Especially at her young age. A lot of people kind of lose themselves, but I didn't want to do that to my mom or my family. So having Mr. Sanders, it was a good help,\" said Singleton. At the end of this year, Sanders is looking back at not only his work, but the impact he's made on the youth. Like two of his students who have been a part of the program since 7th grade. Now they're graduating high school early. \"That definitely was an impact on my high school career. And graduating early, that's a blessing,\" said Martin. \"I learned a lot actually. Landscaping, leadership skills,\" said Singleton. Sanders has even more plans to continue to expand in 2024. He hopes to find a gym for students to use in his program. Sanders thanks the City of Decatur and the Decatur community for their ongoing support.
