    "text": "Russian ban of religious websites ‘blocks truth,’ editor says\n[OSV](https://www.oursundayvisitor.com/russian-ban-of-religious-websites-blocks-truth-editor-says/)\nby Gina Christian\n“An information bubble has long been created in Russia, and according to the wishes of the Kremlin authorities, the Russian reader must receive only the information they need, i.e., virtually no truth,” said Lilia Kovalyk-Vasiuta, chief editor of the [Religious Information Service of Ukraine](https://risu.ua/en/), which was founded by Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.\nOn Oct. 4, [Forum 18](https://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=2935) — a news service that partners with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee in defending freedom of religion, thought and conscience — posted an updated list of affected sites, which confirmed RISU’s blockage starting in March 2022, and which included recently added targets, such the the Belarusian Katolik.Life site.\n“I think it illustrates the Russian authorities’ … obsessions, if you like, in blocking what they call extremist content,” Felix Corley, Forum 18 editor and researcher, told OSV News, noting that the bans are also operative in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.\nCountering Russian propaganda\n“Information from Ukraine provided in Russian that contradicts Russian propaganda is particularly dangerous for (their information) bubble,” said Kovalyk-Vasiuta, who in an Oct. 16 email to OSV News noted that Russia’s targeting of RISU was far from a surprise.\n“We assumed this might happen after the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as the number of readers from Russia suddenly dropped,” she said.\nPrior to attacking Ukraine in February 2022, Russia was “the top second or third country” of the more than 100 countries from which RISU readers hail, accounting “for 3-4% of audience” traffic — on par with site traffic from the U.S., she said.\nYet years before launching its full-scale war on Ukraine — which continues aggression launched in 2014, and which has been declared a genocide in two joint reports from the New Lines Institute and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights — Russia was working to systematically lock down access to external media, while steadily suppressing domestic dissent.\nSince its founding in 2008, the Russian agency Roskomnadzor, the country’s internet and media regulator, has been tasked with blocking and censoring an ever-increasing number of websites that challenge the strict narratives of the Kremlin under President Vladimir Putin.\n“From the very beginning of its existence, RISU has been fighting Russian information manipulations, fakes, etc.,” Kovalyk-Vasiuta told OSV News.\nFighting back with media\nIn 2001, ahead of St. John Paul II’s visit to Ukraine, the decision to create RISU was taken in order “to create a nondenominational information portal about religion in Ukraine that does not represent any church or religious organization, to objectively and impartially represent religious life in Ukraine,” said Kovalyk-Vasiuta.\nA few years later, the RISU team realized that its publications were “being disseminated in a limited and often distorted way in the Russian media,” especially by the Russian Orthodox Church — and so RISU launched a Russian-language version of its site, she said.\n“We decided to inform the Russian-speaking audience ourselves, which led to an increased number of readers from Russia and Central Asia,” Kovalyk-Vasiuta said.\nShe noted that RISU has battled hackers “since the Orange Revolution of 2004,” when the newly independent Ukraine dramatically rejected a return to Moscow’s rule — a popular uprising that RISU covered by highlighting how various churches and religious organizations engaged with the sociopolitical movement.\n“At that time, we actively presented the involvement of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate in supporting the pro-Russian (presidential) candidate (Viktor) Yanukovych, in election fraud and manipulation, diocesan administrations, monasteries, and parishes of the UOC-MP in Ukraine becoming centers of illegal political propaganda, spreading Kremlin fakes, etc.,” said Kovalyk-Vasiuta. “That is why hackers tried to take down our website.”\nDigital assaults and the information war\nThe digital assaults continued, intensifying in 2008 when RISU covered events relating to the visit of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Ukraine to mark the 1020th anniversary of the Baptism of Kyivan-Rus’ in 988, and to attempt to heal divisions in Ukrainian Orthodoxy.\nRISU’s willingness to feature the pro-Ukrainian wing within the UOC-MP clashed with that church’s own official media, which “was controlled by Moscow agents,” Kovalyk-Vasiuta told OSV News.\nDuring Patriarch Bartholomew’s actual visit to Ukraine in July 2008, RISU’s website was rendered inaccessible due to DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, she said.\nKovalyk-Vasiuta said RISU was on the radar of Russian special services when “fully pro-Russian President Yanukovych” was in office from 2010-2014, as the outlet wrote openly about Moscow supporting religious groups that “engaged in socially subversive and anti-state activities in Ukraine” — such as the Dognal group, led by Czech citizen and excommunicated Roman Catholic priest Antonin Dognal.\n“Although they filed a lawsuit against our journalist, he won the case,” she said, adding that she “personally had several incidents of heated discussions with these sectarians, often acting as an expert on the matter, as their activities attracted media attention.”\nDuring Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity (also known as the Maidan or Euromaidan Revolution) — when Ukrainians firmly, and at the cost of more than 100 lives, rejected Yanukovych and his pro-Moscow path — RISU experienced “new waves of attacks,” said Kovalyk-Vasiuta.\n“In the fall of 2014, our portal ended up (being) blocked for nearly a week due to a massive cyberattack by hackers from the CyberBerkut group,” she said.\nA decade later, “smaller attacks have been carried out and continue to this day, including after the launch of the new portal in 2020,” she said.\nLeading a cyber revolution\nYet despite Moscow’s efforts to shut out RISU, “Russian readers continue to access RISU’s website in various ways,” thanks to open VPNs (virtual private networks), she said.\nNow, “100-200 people” in Russia are reading RISU daily, placing that nation back in the top 10 countries that visit the site, she noted.\nShe assumes the rebound “can be explained by the growth in traffic from East Asian countries (for example, Indonesia), where we did not have many readers before.\n“Additionally, they can read our materials in the Telegram channels distributing them,” said Kovalyk-Vasiuta.\nAs Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, Kovalyk-Vasiuta and the RISU team, who operate with “minimal funding” and rely on donors, are determined to persist in their mission.\n“The ‘love’ the Russian authorities express for RISU encourages us to be ever more active in informing people and seeking funding to continue doing so,” she said.",

The main reason people are angry is because tourism in Spain is relentless due to its naturally warm climate, according to locals. It’s not just seasonally when the country is overtaken by tourists , instead, cities like Barcelona and Madrid attract visitors all-year round which keeps tourist numbers consistently high.",

El modus operandi de la banda Desde hace más de un año, el Gaula Militar Santander y el Batallón de Ingenieros de Combate #5 le estaban siguiendo el rastro a esta organización criminal. Las labores de inteligencia permitieron ubicar a 21 presuntos integrantes (siete mujeres y 14 hombres). Las autoridades revelaron que, a través de ocho fundaciones con diferente razón social, la banda cometía los delitos sin generar sospecha. A los presuntos miembros se les señala de secuestro, desaparición forzada y otros actos contra la libertad personal. El Ejército reveló que la red se hacía llamar Casa de Tortura y pertenecía a una misma familia. Sus víctimas habrían sido en su mayoría adultos mayores y habitantes en condición de calle. Las 21 personas tendrán que responder por los presuntos delitos de concierto para delinquir, secuestro, homicidio, desaparición forzada, tortura, acceso carnal violento y tráfico de estupefacientes. Detalles del millonario rojo de una joyería en Bucaramanga El 23 de julio se conoció que ocho delincuentes entraron al Centro Comercial San José Plaza y robaron una joyería. El hurto se cometió en plena luz del día y portando prendas de la Policía. Las cámaras de seguridad mostraron que el plan inició con el ataque que recibieron los vigilantes del local. A pocos minutos, el resto de la banda ingresó, amenazó a los trabajadores y se llevó los productos. Después de analizar más de 500 cámaras de seguridad e interceptar 42 llamadas por meses, las autoridades identificaron que la banda detrás de este hurto se hace llamar ‘Los Kilates’ . Con esta información, fueron capturados alias Jessica (cabecilla), HD, Ojos (monitorearon la seguridad mientras ocurría el robo), Maicol, Charli (se disfrazaron de policías), Lino (transportó la bolsa en la que guardaron los objetos robados), Chejo y Pájaro (los cerebros del plan criminal). \"Esta es una banda trasnacional que llegó a la ciudad, estructuró los actos delictivos y operó con un proceso de inteligencia que no solamente generó un golpe en Bucaramanga, sino que también en otras ciudades del país\", afirmó Jaime Andrés Beltrán, alcalde de la ciudad.

    "text": "Conoce la reflexología facial, el aliado contra el acné [EL UNIVERSAL](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=EL UNIVERSAL) En un mundo donde la piel se convierte en un espejo de nuestra salud interna, la reflexología facial surge como una herramienta fascinante para descifrar los mensajes que nuestro rostro envía sobre nuestro bienestar. ¿Granitos persistentes en la mandíbula? ¿Imperfecciones alrededor de la boca? Conoce qué revela tu piel y cómo la reflexología facial puede ser la clave para entender y abordar posibles desequilibrios internos. ¿Qué es la Reflexología Facial y cómo funciona? La reflexología se ha dado a conocer por ser una medicina alternativa que maneja el dolor y alivia el estrés, entre muchos otros beneficios. Se cree que esta terapia corporal se remonta al año 2500 a.C. en el antiguo Egipto, debido a que se han encontrado evidencias sobre papiro antiguo, estableciendo que la reflexología pudo haber sido utilizada por los practicantes médicos como forma curativa. Sin embargo, en el siglo XX, al Dr. William Fitzgerald se le atribuyó el nombre del padre de la reflexología moderna, debido a que descubrió la terapia zonal, tal como la practicaban las tribus indias norteamericanas. En relación con el mundo de la belleza, la reflexología ha probado ser un gran identificador al tratarse de problemas cutáneos, puesto que ahora se practica la reflexología facial, la que, de igual forma, consiste en la aplicación de presiones y masajes en puntos específicos del rostro. Su poder reside en identificar ciertos problemas internos en función de las zonas del rostro donde suelen aparecer granitos o imperfecciones. \"Con la reflexología se pueden trabajar órganos internos estimulando tanto los pies como el rostro o las manos, pero es cierto que en los pies se puede realizar mayor presión y estimular de forma más intensa\", destacó la experta en belleza Marta Gamarra. TAMBIÉN LEE Así te ayuda la mandarina a mantenerte jovenBeneficia a la salud de los huesos, los músculos y la piel ¿Qué nos indican los granitos frecuentes? Zona de la mandíbula o boca: El acné en estas zonas son habituales debido a la mala alimentación o intolerancia alimentaria. Por eso, se recomienda consultar con un nutricionista si los granitos son persistentes. Alrededor de la barbilla: Se relaciona con patologías hormonales, estrés o dieta desequilibrada. Además, puede indicar dermatitis perioral. Ovulación: El acné localizado puede señalar la ovulación, lo que lleva a consultar con un ginecólogo ya que indicaría alteración hormonal. Granitos en las mejillas: Una relación con los pulmones y señal de mala oxigenación. Posibles efectos del tabaco en la piel. Ojeras y bolsas: Los principales factores son el cansancio y la falta de sueño. Si la patología sigue puede indicar problemas renales. Acné en el entrecejo y contorno de la ceja: Se relaciona con el hígado y la vesícula biliar. Pueden indicar abuso de alcohol, alimentos grasos o intolerancias. Debido a esto, se deben moderar los hábitos y consultar con un especialista. Rojeces y poros dilatados en la nariz: Señal de mala circulación sanguínea. Cuidados primordiales Ante la aparición de acné el comprender que la piel refleja la salud interna es clave. \"La piel es el órgano más grande de nuestro cuerpo que, a su vez, abarca todos los órganos internos. Si tenemos un problema interno, siempre se va a reflejar en nuestra piel\", destaca Marta Gamarra, sumándose al consejo persistente de acudir a un profesional médico.",

    "title": "How My Father & I Built Our Dream Sustainable Mud Home Ourselves",
    "text": "Living in a high-rise apartment in Mumbai, Kiran Amati yearned to lead a simple life. So when it came to buying his own home, he knew perfectly well what he needed — a mud home with all things nature! He decided to build his dream home along with his father on a half-acre farm, 60 km from the city. A nature enthusiast, Kiran’s father was keen on the opportunity. The duo started to take different workshops to understand how mud houses can be made. In the process, Prakash met Shagun Singh, the founder of Geeli Mitti Centre of Excellence, a Uttarakhand-based organisation that makes mud houses at a workshop. Impressed by her work, the father-son duo decided to take a one-month-long course at the institute. “By the end of the course, I believe we had a clear idea of the size of the house we needed, how the rooms would be divided, and a basic structure design in mind,” Kiran recalls. “We executed the whole plan ourselves and did not hire any contractors. Traditional contractors would have no idea how the materials utilised in our house’s construction are used,” he adds. In 2022, with 80 volunteers (whom they reached out to via social media), they started their six-month-long journey of love and labour and named their home — Om Niwas. The circular home, with a diameter of 16 feet, is a studio-style space with bedrooms, a kitchen on the ground floor and a meditation space on the first floor. The house is made of mud, straw and cow dung, and has a unique septic tank filled with a mix of dry leaves, lime and sawdust. Over the time of four to five years, the waste keeps getting decomposed before you have to refill the mix. Furthermore, Kiran collaborated with award-winning artist Lakhichand Jain to paint Mandana art on the walls with Tantra motifs. In the initial stages, the house got many critical reviews. “They [villagers] would say Mumbai rains heavily, and it’s hard to imagine a mud house sustaining for more than two or three years here.” But today, the house is a landmark in the village. “So whenever an auto driver needs directions to the village, locals guide them by referring to our mud house,” smiles Kiran. .",
