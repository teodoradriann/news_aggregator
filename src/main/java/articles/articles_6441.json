    "text": "The multi-billion dollar Bitcoin ATM (BTM) industry in the United States is booming again after a retrenchment during the 2022 “crypto winter.” But should this growth obscure concerns about scams and money laundering?\nUnlike online exchanges, BTMs do not require users to share bank account information. They verify identities by asking for a photo ID and phone number.\nInstant Transactions\nSince cryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain technology, Bitcoin ATMs are often able to complete them instantly. Users simply enter their wallet address or scan a QR code to buy the cryptocurrency of their choice.\nThe increasing prevalence of “\nBitcoin ATM near me” searches reflects the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into everyday life, as people actively seek out accessible and secure avenues for managing their digital assets.\nThe transaction is then recorded in the blockchain and instantly delivered to their digital wallet. This makes it much easier to purchase crypto on the go than using an online exchange, which typically requires a lengthy verification process.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin ATMs often offer more privacy than centralized exchanges by not requiring sensitive information like debit or credit card numbers or bank accounts. While some machines may ask for a cell phone number and four-digit PIN to verify identity, most do not require any personal identification information at all.\nEnhanced Financial Privacy\nBitcoin ATMs don’t require users to connect their bank account or provide identification, which can be beneficial to privacy. However, these machines are still subject to Know Your Customer regulations that protect investors by preventing criminals from using these devices to steal money or identities.\nTypically, the machine will ask for the user’s crypto wallet address and then print a QR code that the user can scan with their smartphone to send the bought cryptocurrency into their wallet. The transaction is then recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible for anyone without the user’s private key to access their wallet and make changes to their balance or ownership.\nThis is a valuable level of security, but users should be sure to follow security best practices when handling their crypto wallet private keys. For example, they should store them in a noncustodial open-source wallet. Ultimately, the trade-off between privacy and convenience is a choice that each individual will have to make based on their personal financial preferences and needs.\nConvenience\nCryptocurrency ATMs are a\nconvenient way to buy Bitcoin by exchanging cash for the digital currency. Once you insert the amount of cash you wish to exchange, the machine will take care of the rest. It will send the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency to your wallet, usually through a QR code.\nThis process is fast, efficient, and easy to use. Most machines also offer a touchscreen to facilitate the transaction. Depending on local regulations, you may need to verify your identity before making a large transaction. This is to prevent money laundering and protect the integrity of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\nAdditionally, the user’s privacy is protected since transactions at a crypto ATM are not linked to a bank account. Instead, the ATM will record the purchase on a public blockchain and then transfer the Bitcoin to your wallet. Once the transaction is complete, you will receive a ticket with your transaction ID to track its status.\nInteresting Related Article: “\nWhat Functions Do Bitcoin ATMs Offer?“",

    "title": "Comment on Why Your Composting Strategy Needs Worms by Restore CBD Gummies Reviews",
    "text": "If you have taken the step to start a compost pile for your garden, it is time to take one more step and consider vermicomposting, or composting with worms.\nUnlike a traditional compost pile, vermicomposting is a wonderful and efficient way to dispose of kitchen waste and turn it into high quality organic compost. You may find that adding wet kitchen waste to your garden compost slows decomposition down. However, it is perfect food for hungry worms, who make quick work of your daily scraps. In fact, vermicomposting can help you reduce your kitchen waste, newspapers and cardboard trash by up to one-third.\nComposting with Worms\nVermicompost, the rich end result from the worm’s work, consists of worm casts (feces) and some decayed organic matter. When worms are happiest and conditions just right, they can actually eat their own weight in organic matter daily. They feed off of the micro-organisms that are eating the organic matter and their casts contain about eight times more micro-organisms than what they are consuming. The great news for gardeners is that the casts don’t contain any pathogenic bacteria, as this is all killed in the worm’s gut.\nWhen compared to ordinary garden soil, worm casts contain five times as much nitrogen, seven times more phosphorus, and 11 times more potassium. Casts are perfect soil conditioners because they contain a large amount of humid acids. These acids have a near perfect pH balance and actually contain the same properties as those found in seaweed.\nWhat kind of worms are used in vermicomposting?\nYou may be familiar with the great big thick earthworms that burrow their way around your garden soil. However, the worms that are used in vermicomposting are actually not these worms but rather worms known as angle worms, manure worms, red wrigglers, river worms or brandlings. They actually live mostly near the surface of the soil where there are large concentrations of organic matter. They are commonly found in compost piles, leaf mold or pastures.\nNew Natural Fertilizer Doubles Garden Production!\nYou can find two different breeds of composting worms at most garden centers — Eisenia foetida or Lumbricus rubellas. In order to start composting with worms like these, you will need at least 1 pound or 1,000 worms which can easily increase to one million worms in a year. By starting with 1,000 worms, you will have an estimated surplus of about 35 pounds of worms in a year — this accounts for eggs that are lost when compost is harvested. You can either let the worms die off as they multiply or you can harvest them to sell, use elsewhere in the garden or start new compost boxes.\nWhat kind of boxes are used when composting with worms?\nAs composting with worms becomes more and more popular, there are a number of commercial worm boxes available. Many of these, however, are made of plastic which does not breathe well. People who have have been practicing vermicomposting for a very long time suggest that gardeners build their own worm box from wood because wood is porous and allows for better ventilation. Making your own will also save you money in the long run.\nBox size: Although you may find recommendations to make bigger boxes, a box that is too large is very difficult to manage. The best thing to do is to make as many boxes that handle 4 pounds of food waste a week as you need. These boxes measure 2-by-2-feet wide and 8-inches deep.\nBox materials and construction: Use exterior grade 1/2-inch plywood, and be sure that it is not chemically treated. Use a non-toxic wood preservative instead or treat the box with vegetable oil. Use galvanized nails to put your box together and drill about twelve 1/2-inch holes in the bottom for ventilation. When you put your box together, be sure that the two sides are about 1/2-inch deeper so that the bottom of the box is elevated off of the ground a little. It is best to put the box in a tray because it will leak some. Also, be sure to make a lid for your box.\nBox bedding\nAdd about 6 pounds of dry material to each worm box. Worms will eat their bedding as well as the food scraps. Any non-toxic fluffy material that holds moisture works well. Be careful not to use anything that will decompose too rapidly like alfalfa hay or green manure. The easiest and best bedding is composed of two-thirds corrugated cardboard and one-third peat moss. You can also use cardboard and newspaper.\nBe sure to cut cardboard into 1-inch wide strips that are about 3 inches long and tear newspaper into 1-inch strips. Other things that make great bedding include aged horse, rabbit or cow manure, coco peat moss, sphagnum peat moss and fall leaves.\nThe Secrets Of Sea Minerals To Grow More “Nutritionally-Dense Food” Than You Can Possibly Eat!\nIn addition to bedding, add two handfuls of sand or soil to help the worms grind up food in their gizzards. Also, add a little bit of ground limestone or wood ash over the bedding. Mix the bedding together and dampen it thoroughly. Add the worms and allow them to settle into their new home for about 3 days before adding any scraps.\nKitchen scraps\nWhen composting with worms, do not feed the worms metal, plastic, or foil. Use only vegetable and fruit scraps, tea bags, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds with filter, stale bread and small pieces of houseplant trimmings. Be sure that all scraps are cut into chunks and add citrus, onion and garlic sparingly. If adding dairy, meat and fish, do so sparingly at first and spread them out well into the bedding. Small or broken chicken bones are also OK but bigger ones won’t break down.\nA good method is to collect kitchen scraps in a bucket with a lid and add to the compost every two days or so. Bury scraps in the bedding in a corner of the box and move to a new spot, close to the first one, next time. A small box can accommodate about nine bury sites.\nAbout every 3 to 6 months, you will need to empty the box.\nHarvesting for use\nMethod One\nDump the material in the box on a large piece of plastic under a bright light or in the sun. Make eight small mounds and wait a few minutes for the worms to bury into the mounds — they do this because they are sensitive to light. Use a hand brush and dustpan to lightly brush the top of each mound until you see worms — wait a bit for them to bury some more. Do this over and over. When you finish, you will have a pile of worms ready for new bedding. Once the worms are in their new bedding, what is left is rich compost. Store the compost for a couple of weeks before using in the garden.\nMethod Two\nPlace a piece of nylon mesh window screening that is a bit bigger than the size of the box — lay it flat on the surface of the vermicompost. Add fresh bedding on top of the screen and continue to feed kitchen scraps. The hungry worms will penetrate the screen into the new bedding to find the food.\nWhen the top layer is ready for harvest, lift the screen out from the box and set it aside. Empty the box filled with high quality vermicompost. Dump the material that was on top of the screen back into the box and put the screen on top with fresh bedding. Be sure that the screen does not rot. Replace as needed.\nMethod Three\nThis is a super easy harvesting method, although you will not get a lot of extra worms. Feed kitchen scraps to your worms for about four months and start a new bed with fresh bedding. To be sure that the new box has enough worms, add a few each time you feed the first box. Once you start feeding the second box, stop feeding the first box. By the time the second box is full, the first box will contain very high quality castings but very few worms.\nTips and tricks:\n- There should be no flies or foul smells when composting with worms. However, if this happens you are feeding the worms more than they can consume. Stop feeding the worms and add some more dry bedding and lime. Stir the bin with a hand fork. Repeat the process as long as the smell persists.\n- Fruit flies may get into the box and they will not cause any harm; however, too many of them means too much feed. Slow down on the feeding and cover the waste with damp newspaper.\n- Your box may also become home to a number of soldier fly maggots or vinegar fly larvae. Although these maggots help with the compost in process, you can add more bedding and lime or even put a piece of bread soaked in milk on the surface. Once the larvae migrate to the bread, take it out and feed it to your chickens — they will love you.\n- Keep your wormery in a shady area outside, and if you have cold temps in the winter you should consider moving the wormery to a warmer location such as a garage or shed. You can also insulate the box by adding a layer of straw on top. Surrounding your worm bin with heavy plastic sheeting or pieces of old carpet will also keep your worms warm.\nUsing the worm compost\nMix the organic compost into the topsoil around your plants. You don’t need much because it is very rich. Use vermicompost to start seedlings by mixing about 25 percent into potting soil for best results. You can also make compost tea by mixing two tablespoons of vermicompost in with a liter of water. Let it sit for one day, shaking once in a while and sprinkle under plants. Be sure not to let vermicompost dry out before using it. Keep a fresh batch brewing all the time to keep your plants healthy and happy.\nWhat vermicomposting tips would you add?

    "text": "Les critiques américaines interviennent après que l'ONG anticorruption Transparency International et le site d'investigation Atlatszo ont annoncé mardi faire l'objet d'une enquête de cette autorité de surveillance, récemment mise en place par le Premier ministre Viktor Orban pour prévenir \"les interférences étrangères\". \"La tentative du gouvernement hongrois de harceler, d'intimider et de punir les organisations indépendantes va à l'encontre des principes de gouvernance démocratique ancrés dans l'état de droit\", a affirmé le porte-parole du département d'Etat, Matthew Miller, dans un communiqué. Plus tôt dans la semaine, le secrétaire d'Etat américain Antony Blinken avait déjà ciblé la Hongrie, qui prendra la présidence du Conseil européen le 1er juillet, en présentant un rapport sur la liberté religieuse dans le monde. En Hongrie, \"des responsables continuent d'utiliser des thèmes antisémites et une rhétorique antimusulmane et ils pénalisent les membres de groupes religieux qui critiquent le gouvernement\", a-t-il dit. Et jeudi, parlant de la protection des personnes LGBT+ dans le monde, il a encore pointé du doigt la Hongrie, y dénonçant le fait que \"le gouvernement salit les personnes LGBT+, en fait des boucs émissaires, les stigmatise, les vilipende avec des étiquettes dégradantes, leur refuse l'égalité des droits et normalise la violence à leur encontre\". Le bureau de protection de la souveraineté, opérationnel depuis février, suscite les inquiétudes de Washington et de l'UE, qui a lancé une procédure d'infraction, s'alarmant d'une nouvelle mise au pas des contre-pouvoirs dans le pays d'Europe centrale. Les investigations de l'autorité pourraient conduire à l'ouverture d'enquêtes judiciaires, avec à la clef d'éventuelles peines de prison.",

    "text": "Mumbai: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Friday that Mumbai's roads will be pothole-free within the next two years as ongoing concretisation efforts continue. Speaking at an event commemorating late Mumbai sheriff and esteemed jurist Nana Chudasama, Shinde urged city residents to collaborate with authorities in preserving Mumbai's cleanliness and beauty.Highlighting recent initiatives, Shinde mentioned a successful deep cleaning campaign that has notably reduced pollution levels. He emphasised that the comprehensive concretisation of Mumbai's roads is presently underway, aimed at achieving a pothole-free city by the coming years. Shinde noted the coordinated efforts between civic authorities, government agencies, and police to alleviate traffic congestion, with additional cleanliness drives underway across Mumbai's beaches.Addressing improvements in infrastructure, Shinde pointed out a decrease in traffic congestion in south Mumbai following the partial opening of the coastal road. He noted that this development has resulted in significant savings in time, money, and fuel for commuters.Shinde also stressed the importance of collective community effort in city development, stating that when individuals and organisations unite for Mumbai's progress, the pace of development and beautification accelerates.Mumbai crime branch summons chief BMC officer in Ghatkopar hoarding collapse caseThe Mumbai Crime Branch has summoned Gajanan Bellale, the chief BMC officer of the area of Ghatkopar East, in connection with the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse in Maharashtra.Seventeen people died and 74 were left injured in the incident that happened on May 13 amid strong winds and heavy rains in Mumbai.The crime branch has asked Bellale to appear for questioning today.Earlier on May 31, the Mumbai Sessions Court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea filed by Jhanvi Marathe, former director of Ego Media, in connection with the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse in Maharashtra.With PTI Inputs",

Permane una criticità ordinaria per rischio idrogeologico sull'Iglesiente, Campidano, Montevecchio Pischinappiu, Flumendosa Flumineddu e Tirso.\n\"Si segnala la possibilità di rovesci o temporali localmente di forte intensità sulle medesime aree, con cumulati fino a molto elevati. La fenomenologia di forte intensità sarà meno probabile sul settore nordorientale\", fa sapere la Protezione civile regionale.\nLa forte ondata di maltempo prevista nell'Isola alla fine siè scaricata in mare . \"Il carattere del fenomeno - ha spiegato Daniela Pani, della direzione regionale della Protezione civile- aveva una grande impredicibilità proprio perché assieme a piogge e rovesci erano previsti forti temporali, che si portano dietro una grande incertezza. Per fortuna i famosi 50 chilometri che non fanno la differenza per il meteo ma la fanno per il territorio hanno fatto sì che i temporali si sviluppassero prevalentemente in mare\".\nQuanto alle polemiche per la chiusura delle scuole a Cagliari in presenza di un'allerta non rossa ma arancione, Pani ha ribadito: \"La valutazione dello scenario di rischio sulla base delle informazioni meteorologiche che arrivano è sempre un lavoro di grande protezione e di autotutela. La scelta degli scenari è sempre a favore della protezione delle vite umane, degli animali e dei beni\".\ntemporali maltempo Sardegna",

The pilgrims have taken vaccines and completed paying the fees electronically to complete the travel proceedings. The Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) and Islamic Affairs has said that various units of the Qatari Haj Mission have started working to ensure that the pilgrims perform Haj with ease. The mission is supported by several units that provide qualitative services to the country’s pilgrims. These include Sharia, medical, information systems and communication units along with a support centre. Also, there are units of control and inspection, logistics services, co-ordination, follow-up and airport. The public relations and media unit also works with the mission. The Medical Unit is working to provide the necessary health care to the pilgrims in Makkah. A specialised team of doctors will accompany the pilgrims from Qatar. The unit will provide all the necessary capabilities, equipment, medicines and treatments for Qatari pilgrims with specialised doctors, nurses, paramedics and pharmacists accompanying the Qatari Haj delegation. To provide high-level health services that guarantee the safety and health of the country’s pilgrims the team will work in co-operation with the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation and the Primary Health Care Corporation.

    "text": "Jaipur: A resident of Balotra district, Ramaram Bishnoi, who allegedly uploaded on social media a morphed obscene video of Independent MLA Bayana Ritu Banawat, was arrested in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur on Wednesday. A police officer said that Bishnoi had a cosmetics shop in Kolhapur. “The accused was brought to Bayana for interrogation. He had no prior connection with the MLA, and there was no animosity; it was purely for garnering social media reach,” the officer said.Police officers revealed that the youth had previously uploaded a similar video featuring former Barmer MLA, Mewaram Jain, which fetched him good response on social media. Subsequently, he uploaded the morphed video of Banawat.Banawat had last week filed a complaint with the Assembly Speaker and police, stating that morphed obscene videos were circulating on social media with her name and image. These videos were being shared as reels on platforms like Facebook and X from various accounts, accompanied by captions referring to them as related to the MLA, she said.Banawat said she became aware of the deepfake videos after receiving calls from acquaintances, leading her to submit a complaint to the Bharatpur SP. Speaker Vasudev Devnani also sought a report in this regard. The MLA urged people not to share the videos and to report intentional sharing. Emphasizing that it was the government's responsibility to ensure that women were safe in Rajasthan, she asked, “If this is happening to a politically established woman, then what would be the common woman’s condition?”A police officer said, “The cyber cell tracked down the handles from where the video was circulated. Linking the chain, it reached the accused.”",
