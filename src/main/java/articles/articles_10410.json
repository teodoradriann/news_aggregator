    "title": "Guga exalta Bia Haddad e Fonseca, e pede 'empolgação' para crescente do tênis no Brasil",
    "text": "Maior tenista da história do Brasil, Gustavo Kuerten, o popular Guga,\naproveitou o lançamento de sua série, em São Paulo, para falar sobre dois nomes do tênis brasileiro: João Fonseca e Bia Haddad.\nGuga destacou a ascensão de Bia, melhor brasileira no ranking mundial (20ª posição), e apontou grande futuro para João (162 do ranking).\n“Vejo que estamos em um momento bem agradável do tênis com a Bia Haddad reluzindo e vindo um menino como o João Fonseca que é uma tendência de sucesso enorme, dos mais precoces existentes da história do tênis, nunca teve algo tão fantástico para criar perspectivas”, disse Guga.\nO primeiro episódio da série relembra a conquista de Guga em Roland Garros em 1997. Após vencer o espanhol Sergi Bruguera, a cidade de Santa Catarina, local onde nasceu, “parou” para comemorar com bandeiras, buzinas e desfile pelas ruas.\n“É difícil imaginar qual seria uma nova realidade, moldar pontos específicos, ter uma solução pronta pois requer muito trabalho, é um projeto difícil, pertinente a muitos esportes do Brasil. Sempre teremos e existe uma capacidade de crescimento. Vivemos um momento de melhor ilusão, mais palpável para quem sabe uma nova história dessa, uma empolgação nacional consiga dar uma girada. Quando se tem ciclos montados de uma próxima geração vindo três ou quatro jogadores, cria uma engrenagem suficiente”, disse.\n“Tênis é complexo. É preciso investir bastante. Na decisão leva pessoas a optarem por outros caminhos. Cenário já é muito melhor do que convivemos, mas pelo nível de dificuldade, de gabarito, sempre estamos correndo atrás de algo que no mundo inteiro é acelerado. Por isso, vejo que é uma tarefa árdua para tentar resolver”, completa Guga.\nOs assinantes do canal Disney+ terão acesso aos episódios do documentário “Guga por Kuerten” apenas no dia 10 de setembro, dia do aniversário do tenista. A série com declarações de nomes importantes do tênis mundial. O espanhol Rafael Nadal e o sérvio Novak Djokovic foram um dos entrevistados e falaram sobre o brasileiro.\nVeja abaixo galeria de fotos do ex-tenista Guga Kuerten:",

    "title": "Catatonia Associated With Post-Acute COVID-19 in a Young Child",
    "text": "T o date, there have been more than 800 million confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) infection globally, including 6.9 million deaths. 1 Numerous reports have detailed neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 infection, including cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. There have also been several reports describing catatonia in the setting of COVID-19 infection. However, these reports have primarily been described in adults and have been associated with the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. 2 There are limited but growing reports of catatonia associated with acute COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients 3–5 and in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 infection in adults. 6–8 Varying definitions of “post-acute” or “post–COVID-19” conditions led the World Health Organization (WHO) to issue a clinical case definition for a post–COVID-19 condition in children, which can be summarized as symptoms causing functional impairment that initially occurred within 3 months of confirmed or probable SARS-CoV 2 infection and that have lasted at least 2 months. 9 We present a case of catatonia in a young pediatric patient associated with the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCase Report A 4-year-old girl with a history of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and no significant medical history presented to her primary care provider for cough with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two weeks after diagnosis, she began a 10- day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate for lingering sinus symptoms, which ultimately resolved. Four weeks after diagnosis, she appeared less interactive and engaged in uncharacteristic behaviors such as lying on the ground and repeatedly covering her ears and eyes. Over the next few weeks, she exhibited a dramatic reduction in meaningful speech, increased repetitive purposeless movements (jumping and rubbing limbs on objects), increased repetitive speech, grimacing, gait changes, ambitendency, and urinary incontinence. Three months after initial diagnosis, she was admitted to a tertiary care academic medical center for further workup. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies—including autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and infectious CSF panels—were unremarkable except for low ferritin (3.3 ng/mL). Antistreptolysin O titer was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine was unremarkable. Electroencephalogram showed slow and disorganized background but was otherwise unremarkable. Rapid whole-genome sequencing, including mitochondrial DNA sequencing, was unremarkable. Given the negative workup, she was discharged home.\nAt this point, catatonia was suspected, and empiric treatment with oral lorazepam was started and gradually increased to 0.7 mg 3 times daily. Seven days after beginning lorazepam, she had her first formal evaluation in the outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry clinic. At this visit, she displayed motor excitement; constant stereotypies; frequent mannerisms, grimacing, and impulsivity; and occasional mutism, posturing, echolalia, verbigeration, negativism, ambitendency, and perseveration. She scored 21 on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS). 10 During this visit, her parents reported that since starting lorazepam, she had become more interactive, and her gait had become more fluid. Contemporaneous laboratory workup showed elevated creatine phosphokinase (252 U/L).\nOver the course of several months, lorazepam was titrated to a maximum of 8 mg daily in divided doses. Treatment with lorazepam was associated with further improvements in meaningful speech and ambitendency, as well as resolution of echolalia, mutism, verbigeration, and perseveration. Unfortunately, relative to baseline, symptoms of excitement, posturing, stereotypies, mannerisms, and impulsivity persisted, albeit improved from onset. At higher lorazepam doses, she displayed increased emotional lability and apparent fatigue; therefore, her dose was gradually decreased. Her BFCRS scores were serially monitored, gradually decreasing from an initial score of 21 to a score of 7 at 84 days posttreatment initiation at a total daily dose of 5.5 mg. Eventually, lorazepam was tapered off at the request of her parents, who opted to pursue treatment with steroids. At the time of the last contact in our clinic and after initial steroid treatment, she had not yet returned to her baseline.\nDiscussion To our knowledge, our patient is the youngest to date to be diagnosed with catatonia associated with SARS CoV-2 infection. Previous cases have been documented in adolescents as young as age 15 years. Our case is also unique given the onset of catatonia occurred 4 weeks after initial laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection and persisted for >3 months, which meets the WHO’s case definition for a post–COVID-19 condition in children and adolescents. 9\nThere have been multiple studies describing the neuropsychiatric sequela of COVID-19. Impaired concentration, memory loss, sleep difficulties, and increased risk for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder have been reported. 11,12 The incidence of catatonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. A study 13 using the 2020 National Inpatient Sample reported a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 infection co-occurred in 3.7% of hospitalizations for catatonia, but the study also noted potential issues with recognition of catatonia and COVID-19 and likely errors in diagnostic coding of catatonia. Cases of mild or post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with catatonia, such as our case, may be underreported Given the suspected association between catatonia and SARS-CoV-2, several causal mechanisms have been proposed. Ong et al 14 recently published a review of the proposed mechanisms of neurological complications of post-acute COVID 19, which supports hypotheses related to SARS-CoV 2 neuroinvasion, hypoxia, and immune dysregulation. Spiegel et al 7 previously reported a case of catatonia associated with postacute SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 59-year old patient with an initially severe infection, in which they hypothesized increased vulnerability to catatonia may arise from reduced dopamine neurotransmission following the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain and subsequent neuroinflammation. Additional hypotheses for a causal mechanism have been made, such as molecular mimicry. 15 γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic intracortical impairment has been observed in patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19. 16 Interestingly, GABA-A receptor levels have also been shown to be downregulated in brains of individuals with autism, 17 which may be related to the limited response to benzodiazepine treatment in our patient. It is unclear whether the mechanism by which SARS-CoV 2 infection precipitates catatonia might differ from the numerous other medical conditions that have been associated with catatonia in the literature. It is also worth noting that catatonia is relatively common in patients with autism 18 ; therefore, an infection such as SARS-CoV-2 may be regarded as an additional insult in patients who are at a likely higher vulnerability for catatonia.\nIt is also unclear whether the patient’s partial response to benzodiazepine treatment is at all related to SARS-CoV-2 infection status, the timing of treatment for catatonia after initial onset, or her comorbidity of ASD. Partial response to benzodiazepine treatment for catatonia is well-documented. In a prospective naturalistic cohort study of 66 children and adolescents with catatonia, benzodiazepines were effective in 65% of cases when used, with greater clinical response associated with less severe initial symptoms of catatonia and with acute onset (<10 days) of catatonia symptoms. 19 Numerous studies have documented the association between ASD and catatonia. 20 The delayed diagnosis of catatonia by approximately 2 months after onset of behavioral regression in the current case is worth noting and underscores frequent missed or misdiagnosis of catatonia in both psychiatric and general medical settings. 21–25 In a case series 26 of 22 patients with ASD and catatonia, most patients had partial or no response to benzodiazepine treatment and were ultimately treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been documented to successfully treat catatonia associated with COVID-19 in several adults 2,27 and in an adolescent. 5 ECT has been shown to be effective for treating catatonia in young children, although this modality has not specifically been studied in treatment of catatonia associated with COVID-19. Given the patient’s young age and her family’s preference, ECT was not pursued in this case.\nThis case highlights the risk of catatonia as an underlying etiology for the clinical presentation of behavioral regression during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a young child, especially when there is a comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder or ASD. Furthermore, as the delay in treatment was approximately 2 months after initial onset of behavioral regression, the adverse effect of delayed treatment cannot be ignored. It is recommended that young patients presenting with behavioral regression around the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection be monitored for catatonia and for consideration of treatment with benzodiazepines, with ongoing monitoring for the need for further interventions, such as ECT, as needed.\nArticle Information Published Online: January 9, 2025. https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.24cr03796\n2025 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.\nPrim Care Companion CNS Disord 2025;27(1):24cr03796\nSubmitted: June 23, 2024; accepted September 12, 2024.\nTo Cite: Van Pay A, Mohiuddin S, Ghaziuddin N.

    "text": "The EU will not be intimidated by Russia and will continue to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said.\nMitsotakis made the comment during his speech at the European People's Party (EPP) conference in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, on Thursday, a day after his visit to the Ukrainian city of Odessa. During that trip, a Russian missile reportedly hit the port of Odessa 800 meters away from the motorcade in which Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and the Greek PM were traveling.\n“I was in Odessa yesterday with President Zelensky when a Russian ballistic missile hit the port during our visit to the facility and I think we all have a message for the Kremlin: We shall not be intimidated,” Mitsotakis vowed.\nHe described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as “Europe’s darkest hour,” claiming that the EU’s determination to back Kiev and place sanctions on Moscow was “maybe unexpected for some of our enemies.”\nRead more US ‘will not bow down’ to Russia – Biden Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded to Mitsotakis’ statements in a post on Telegram on Thursday, insisting that “we [Moscow] never intimidated and aren’t intimidating anybody, including Greece.”\nShe pointed out that Europe was not always the same throughout its history. “The Third Reich was also Europe. And for such a ‘Nazi Europe,’ we will always be an enemy,” the spokeswoman stressed.\nZakharova recalled how during music lessons at her Russian school she used to study the works of Mikis Theodorakis, a legendary Greek composer most famous for Sirtaki dance music. “He, too, was an enemy of Europe, Nazi Europe,” she said.\nTheodorakis was once a symbol of the resistance to the right-wing military dictatorship known as the Regime of the Colonels, which ruled Greece in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During that time, his music was banned; the composer was imprisoned for five months and eventually forced into exile.\n“Do not betray… the memory of the Greek Resistance,” Zakharova urged Mitsotakis.\nREAD MORE: ‘No limits’ to support for Ukraine – Macron The EU has given Ukraine around 88 billion euros ($96.2 billion) since the start of the conflict in February 2022. Russian officials have repeatedly warned that the foreign aid provided to Kiev will not prevent Moscow from achieving the goals of its military operation, and will only prolong the fighting and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.\nYou can share this story on social media: Follow RT on",
