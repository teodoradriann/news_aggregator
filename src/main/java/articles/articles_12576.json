    "text": "The Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card is one of the best business cards with no annual fee because it earns 1.5% back on every purchase. This card also has a $900 bonus cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening although this offer is ending soon — apply today to take advantage of it. Card Rating*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n*Card Rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer. The Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card is a small-business card that closely mirrors the popular Chase Freedom Unlimited, but with a much higher introductory bonus (that's ending soon). There is no annual fee, and its simple reward structure is more valuable than it looks at first glance.\nAlthough other cards earn 1.5% cash back (or more), with the Ink Business Unlimited card, you can earn cash back in the form of Chase Ultimate Rewards points . Those Chase points can become significantly more valuable if you also have a premium Ultimate Rewards card. That's because you can combine Chase points from your accounts and then transfer them to the Ultimate Rewards program's various airline and hotel partners.\nThe Ink Business Unlimited is a business credit card and is thus tailored to those with small businesses. While not everyone is eligible for a business credit card , it may be easier to be approved than you think — provided you have a \"good to excellent\" credit score of 670 or above — because freelancing and other sole-proprietor enterprises can count as a business in the eyes of Chase and many other issuers.\nInk Business Unlimited welcome offer Currently, the welcome offer on the Ink Business Unlimited is $900 cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This matches the best-ever offer we saw on the card from October 2022 to March 2023 — but you should act soon as this limited-time offer is coming to a close soon.\nThe $900 cash back is earned in the form of uber-flexible Chase Ultimate Rewards points (90,000 points), which you can redeem at a rate of 1 cent each as cash back, gift cards or travel booked through the Chase Travel portal.\nTHE POINTS GUY However, you can more than double your return (potentially) if you pair the Ink Business Unlimited with a card that earns transferable Ultimate Rewards points, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card . According to TPG valuations , 90,000 Ultimate Rewards points are worth $1,845. That's a solid haul on a card that charges no annual fee.\nInk Business Unlimited benefits You get what you pay for when it comes to benefits, so it's no surprise that the Ink Business Unlimited doesn't offer as many perks as other cards with higher annual fees. Its benefits are identical to those offered by the Ink Business Cash Credit Card but they're not quite as good as the perks offered on the Ink Business Preferred Credit Card . Most notably, you will not get cellphone protection or trip cancellation/interruption insurance.\nHere's a quick rundown of what's included:\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time. Purchase protection: This covers new purchases for up to 120 days against damage or theft, up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per account. Auto rental collision damage waiver: When you rent a car for business purposes using Ink Business Unlimited, you can decline the rental car company's collision insurance and be covered by the card up to the vehicle's cash value in the case of theft or collision damage. This is valid on most rentals in the U.S. and abroad, and coverage is primary , which means it applies before your own car insurance policy. Extended warranty: This extends the time period of a U.S. manufacturer's warranty by an additional year on eligible warranties of three years or less. Employee cards at no additional cost: If employees are allowed to use the account, they will be authorized users and will have equal charging privileges, unless you establish individual spending limits. Earning rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited The Ink Business Unlimited earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases using a straightforward rewards structure that requires no thinking about rotating or bonus categories. This represents both the beauty of this card and its potential downside.\nFor example, if you buy airfare with this card, you could be forgoing rewards of up to 5 points per dollar that a card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers (when booked through the Chase Travel Portal ).\nThe same goes for paying for office supplies or internet service. The Ink Business Cash earns 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable, cellphone and landline services each account anniversary year (1% thereafter). It also earns 2% back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account year.\nBe careful about evaluating this card only on its cash-back value. The unlimited cash-back offered by this card won't give you the highest return among cash-back business credit cards — if you redeem for cash, anyway.\nRedeeming rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited There are a few key ways to redeem your rewards: cash back, gift cards, travel or goods and services offered through Chase's rewards program.\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY If you redeem for cash, you can receive your money as a statement credit or through an electronic deposit into an eligible U.S. checking or savings account. Points redeemed for cash, gift cards or travel are worth 1 cent apiece.\nTransferring rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited You can boost your redemption rate to an effective return of 3% (based on TPG's valuations) on all spending if you move your points to a full-fledged Ultimate Rewards personal or business card, such as:\nInk Business Preferred Credit Card Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Chase Sapphire Reserve The other card must be registered to you, the owner of the company or a member of your household to qualify for a transfer.\nThe Ink Business Unlimited can represent an incredible value proposition when partnered with any of these other cards. Once you move points to an account that earns Ultimate Rewards, you can transfer them to valuable airline and hotel partners , or book travel directly through the Chase portal and receive a flat value for your points (1.5 cents per point with the Chase Sapphire Reserve; or 1.25 cents per point with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink Business Preferred).\nYou could get well over 2 cents per point in value, depending on which transfer partner you choose. For example, you could transfer 97,000 points to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer to book a one-way, first-class flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA) that regularly costs $5,000 or more, getting you nearly six cents per point.\nRelated: The power of the Chase Trifecta: Sapphire Reserve, Ink Preferred and Freedom Unlimited\nWhat cards compete with the Ink Business Unlimited? The Ink Business Unlimited's competitors are cards that offer a similar return on all spending. Business credit cards that offer fixed-rate rewards include:\nCapital One Spark Miles for Business : Earn 2 miles per dollar on all purchases. Earn a sign-up bonus of 50,000 bonus miles after spending $4,500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening. The introductory annual fee is $0, then $95 after (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of the Capital One Spark Miles for Business . Capital One Spark Cash Select for Excellent Credit : Earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Earn a sign-up bonus of $750 once you spend $6,000 on purchases within three months from account opening. This card has no annual fee (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of the Capital One Spark Cash Select for Excellent Credit . The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express : Earn 2 points per dollar on all eligible business purchases up to $50,000 per calendar year (1 point per dollar thereafter). This card has no annual fee (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of The Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express . Read more: The best business credit cards\nIs the Ink Business Unlimited worth it? The Ink Business Unlimited is a valuable option for everyday spending if you pair it with the right card. The Ink Business Cash Credit Card and Ink Business Preferred Credit Card don't offer a solid return on everyday, non-bonus spending, so this card fills that gap.\nYou can really maximize your business credit card rewards by pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with a premium Chase card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve . Watch out for the restrictions of the Chase 5/24 rule , though.\nBottom line One advantage to opening Chase business credit cards is that they won't add to your Chase 5/24 count once they're open, even though applying for them in the first place is subject to the rule.\nSo, if you qualify for business credit cards, it's a smart strategy to apply for a Chase business card, like the Ink Business Unlimited , before you apply for personal credit cards from Chase or other banks, which will count toward that 5/24 limit. And this card offers a great return on everyday spending that can be supercharged if you have another card earning Chase Ultimate Rewards points.",

    "text": "29 nov, 2024 - 09:32 • [Beatriz Pereira](https://rr.sapo.pt/artigo/333080/beatriz-pereira)\nO Partido Chega pendurou, esta sexta-feira, faixas nas janelas do Parlamento, em forma de protesto contra a medida aprovada quinta-feira, no debate de especialidade do Orçamento do Estado, que estabelece o fim do corte dos salários dos políticos.\nA medida foi apresentada pelo PSD e CDS e acaba com o corte de 5% do salário dos titulares de cargos políticos e gestores públicos, já a partir de janeiro. Foi aprovada com os votos a favor do PS, PSD e CDS e PAN. Votos contra do Chega, Bloco de Esquerda, Livre e Iniciativa Liberal, e a abstenção do PCP.\nNa rede social X, o líder do Chega, André Ventura, partilhou uma fotografia onde se pode ler nas faixas frases como \"OE2025 aumenta o salário dos políticos. Vergonha”.\n\"Num momento em que não há dinheiro para pensões ou baixar impostos, os partidos aumentaram o salários dos políticos neste Orçamento.\nNão passarão impunes!\", escreveu André Ventura.\nNoutras faixas veem-se também as caras do primeiro-ministro, Luís Montenegro, e do líder do PS, Pedro Nuno Santos, com notas de euros à frente do rosto.\nJá o vice-presidente do Chega. Pedro dos Santos Frazão, partilhou também uma imagem de um cartaz na rua, onde escreve que \"este orçamento vai aumentar os salários dos políticos e mantém as subvenções milionárias aos partidos!\".\nEsta sexta-feira realiza-se a votação final do Orçamento do Estado para 2025.\nOrçamento do Estado\nOposição conseguiu aprovar mais de uma centena de (...)",

    "text": "The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Mr. Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata , has attributed his success story in the management and advancement of technological initiatives and innovations in Anambra to journalists. Agbata in a press statement personally signed by him, noted that his partnership and collaborations with journalists in the state made it possible for him to succeed as well as excel greatly in his assignment as the MD/CEO of the state ICT agency. He said that the role of journalists as moral compass of the society can not be overemphasized, hence the society relies heavily on their functions as agenda setters to inform and enlighten the people on public policy, which he said, was where the ICT agency leveraged on to showcase her activities to Ndi-Anambra. While expressing profound gratitude and deep appreciation to journalists for the robust synergy and coverage of his programmes and activities from inception as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Agbata equally thanked Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, who provided the enabling environment for him to prove his mettle as a tech expert. His press statement reads, ” I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for your continued support and coverage of Anambra State’s innovative ICT initiatives and the transformative work happening under the visionary leadership of Governor Charles Soludo. Your reporting on Anambra State’s technological advancements is much more than just news coverage – it serves as a beacon, illuminating the incredible journey the state is on. Your dedication to showcasing the positive impact of ICT aligns perfectly with Governor Soludo’s vision for a progressive and technologically advanced Anambra. Your work is a shining example of the power of journalism to inform and inspire. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, your role as a journalist is more important than ever. By telling the stories of Anambra State’s ICT initiatives, you are bridging the gap between the Agency and the people it serves. Your coverage helps us all understand and engage with the transformative work that is happening. As we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, we want to thank you for your indispensable role in helping us share, celebrate, and inform the public about these exciting developments. I am honored to have you as a partner on this journey, and look forward to continuing to work together to promote the continued growth and success of ICT in Anambra State.

    "text": "By Gabriella Phelan ,\n2 hours ago\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — Arkansas has seen a nearly 25% rise in Influenza cases during the second week of December.\nAccording to the Arkansas Department of Health, from Dec. 8 to Dec. 14, more than 165 total cases, 10 hospitalizations, and one death were reported.\nOne local pharmacist says seeing an uptick this early in the year is unusual, but not surprising.\n“We’re seeing a peak right now. But, you know, we’re really just getting into the Christmas season. So, a lot of people are going to be traveling and going to other parts of the country,” said Caul Corbell, pharmacist at Live Well Pharmacy in Fayetteville. “There’s no set standard on when it’s going to peak throughout the season. So, it’s a little bit earlier than usual from what I’ve seen in the past.”\nSince Sept. 29, 873 cases of various different types of flu have been reported to the ADH.\nAlice Walton aims to change healthcare in Northwest Arkansas Corbell says although the peak time to get your vaccines has passed, he still encourages people to take that safety measure.\n“Most of the vaccine traffic has slowed at this point because usually the vaccines come out in early September. A lot of times people are getting those vaccines in September and October,” Corbell said. “I always like to encourage people and say it’s never too late. Vaccines are typically covered at a $0 copay on most insurances.”\nBetween December and April, Corbell says the pharmacy will dispense all kind of medications, but one stands out amongst the rest.\n“Between now and April will be when we see the most of our dispensing of flu medications,” Corbell said.\nHowever, he says five minutes of time can keep you protected.\n“We can get you in and out in less than 5 minutes here. So, it’s quick and easy. It’s convenient, and it’s by far the best way to prevent getting the flu,” Corbell said. “It introduces an antigen into your body, such to elicit a response from your immune system that helps your immune system create antibodies that if it’s then encountered with the actual flu virus, it already has the antibodies built up in store to fight off the virus.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "title": "AEMET y una nueva Filomena: la agencia de meteorología NO ha emitido ninguna \"alerta por ola de frío\" a 28 de diciembre de 2023",
    "text": "“¡Alerta de ola de frío! Dicen que vendrá similar a Filomena. Posible llegada de una gran masa de aire frío a la Península Ibérica”, afirma un\ntuit de ABC del 27 de diciembre de 2023. Pero ni los meteorólogos citados en el contenido ni la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) han alertado a 28 de diciembre de una ola de frío.\nEl propio cuerpo del\ncontenido de ABC reconoce que la AEMET no ha emitido “alerta” por ola de frío.\n“La AEMET no emite alertas sino avisos. En el caso de que llegara una ola de frío intensa, la AEMET emitiría un aviso especial por nuestros canales oficiales. Del 28 de diciembre a los próximos 10 días no está prevista la llegada de una ola de frío, mucho menos de la intensidad de Filomena. De hecho es probable que la próxima semana tenga unas temperaturas superiores a lo habitual para la época del año por la llegada de vientos templados”, explica el portavoz de la AEMET, Rubén del Campo a\nMaldita.es.\nEl contenido se basa en la posibilidad del debilitamiento y rotura del\nvórtice polar estratosférico, unos fuertes vientos que circulan a más de 15 kilómetros sobre la superficie del Polo Norte o Ártico. Mario Picazo, meteorólogo en eltiempo.es y profesor de Meteorología y Cambio Climático en la Universidad de California en Los Ángeles (Estados Unidos), comunicaba en su cuenta de Twitter sobre esa posible rotura el 26 de diciembre pero aclaraba que “habrá que ir confirmando día a día” porque “un intenso calentamiento estratosférico no siempre consigue transferir su influencia hacia las capas inferiores”.\nEs decir, que incluso si llegara a ocurrir la rotura del vértice polar no tendría por qué traducirse en “descensos masivos de masas de aire polar hacia latitudes más bajas, inclusive las del Mediterráneo” y, por tanto, en una ola de frío en la península ibérica.\nLa propia AEMET comunicó\nel 19 de diciembre de 2023, en base al titular “Aemet alerta de la posible llegada de una ola de frío por la amenaza de \"rotura del vórtice polar\"”, que ni la agencia meteorológica ni sus portavoces habían “‘alertado’ de la posible llegada de un ola de frío, cualquiera que sea su causa”. También informó que la previsión a 19 de diciembre para las siguientes tres semanas era de que “las temperaturas estén por encima de lo normal”. Este comunicado está incluido en el contenido de ABC.\nEl meteorólogo de la AEMET\nJuan Jesús González Alemán ha aclarado a 27 de diciembre de 2023 que “es pronto para hablar aún” de un efecto en las latitudes de la península ibérica pese a aumentar las probabilidades de que se rompa el vórtice polar en los próximos días.\nEl portavoz de la AEMET destaca a\nhttp://pmv0a que es importante que “los medios de comunicación mantengan el rigor a la hora de informar de la predicción del tiempo porque estas informaciones no sujetas a la realidad pueden hacer que la ciudadanía pierda confianza en los pronósticos del tiempo y, que cuando llegue un aviso especial verdadero por ola de frío, puede suceder que haya personas que no lo tomen en serio. Es importante que se tengan en consideración los avisos de la AEMET porque una ola de frío puede ser un fenómeno extremo que puede poner en peligro a las personas”.\nEn noviembre de 2022\nya desmentimos que la AEMET hubiese lanzado un aviso por una ola de frío ártico en base a la posibilidad de la rotura del vértice polar estratosférico. Finalmente no hubo ola de frío en España en las semanas siguientes.",

Attraverso le due cartoline si lasciò un ricordo dell’evento a coloro che il 13 giugno 2023 confluirono in piazza Saffi per ammirare le storiche auto che partecipavano alla manifestazione. In particolare Davide Sarasini dipinse una vettura mentre taglia il traguardo della tappa cittadina con sullo sfondo due monumenti di Forlì: la porta di Schiavonia e la statua di Icaro. Nell’opera appare inoltre la figura di Ercole Baldini. Questo quadro, accompagnato da un contributo di 500 euro devoluto dal comitato, è stato donato a Il Trenino, gruppo educativo che offre servizi per bimbi dai 6 ai 36 mesi nelle sedi di via Pelacano e di via Ghibellina: entrambe le sedi erano state notevolmente danneggiate dall’alluvione.\nSi è svolta nelle scorse settimane anche la cerimonia di consegna dell’importo di 250 euro a studente (20mila in tutto) per le borse di studio che il comitato di Forlì della Bcc ravennate, forlivese e imolese ha voluto erogare per gli studenti residenti a Forlì iscritti alle scuole superiori le cui abitazioni hanno subito danni rilevanti. Su 96 alunni iscritti in graduatoria, in 80 hanno potuto beneficiare della borsa di studio.\nUna delegazione del Gruppo Podistico Avis Forlì, guidata dal presidente Lorenzo Gemma, ha consegnato al comitato di quartiere dei Romiti, rappresentato da Stefano Valmori, il materiale tecnologico che è stato possibile acquistare grazie alle donazioni effettuate dai partecipanti alla manifestazione di beneficenza ‘CorriAMO i Romiti’, svolta lo scorso dicembre. Il ricavato servirà per l’acquisto di un kit multimediale per proiezioni video: computer, videoproiettore, impianto audio e telo/schermo da 150 pollici per la sala polifunzionale, distrutta nel disastro.\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",
