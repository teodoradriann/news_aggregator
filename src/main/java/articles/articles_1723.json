    "title": "Man who died with wife and son in Alberta lake wasn't a risk-taker, says friend | National | chroniclejournal.com",
    "text": "An Edmonton man who died with his wife and eight-year-old son after their utility terrain vehicle went into a lake wasn't the kind of person to put his family at risk, says a friend. \"I would never, ever think he was the type of person to purposely put himself or his wife and kid in any kind of danger,\" Michael Occhionero said. \"To me, that's a freak accident.\" Kelly Pelsma, 39; his wife, Laura Pelsma, 37; and their son, Dylan, were reported missing Christmas Day. They hadn't been heard from since Dec. 23 and were last seen in Alberta Beach, northwest of Edmonton on Lac Ste. Anne, on a side-by-side vehicle. On Tuesday, RCMP said an underwater recovery team found the family and warned about the dangers of thin ice. Their bodies were found in the water along with the vehicle in an area near the Alexis Bridge. Occhionero, who lives in Idaho, said he and a group of friends met Kelly Pelsma at UTV Invasion, a gathering of side-by-side off-road enthusiasts, in 2018 in Idaho. Pelsma's side-by-side had broken down and Occhionero said they helped him put a new belt on the vehicle. \"We had a good time with him, rode around, talked a lot, drank, had fires, and watched drag racing and stuff.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, Occhionero said he and Pelsma talked on the phone a few times a month. He and Pelsma reunited at this year's event in St. Anthony, Idaho. Pelsma also brought his wife and their son. \"It was just me and the three of them,\" said Occhionero. \"We had a great time.\" He said Pelsma was like a giant teddy bear who also liked adventure. \"He liked to live life on the edge, but I think all of us motorheads do to some degree,\" Occhionero said. \"He was very cautious, like a calculated-risk type of guy.\" Photos of Pelsma and his family at the UTV event were posted on his Facebook page in September. Laura Pelsma also posted smiling pictures of their wedding day from the spring. The couple and their son posed near an oil derrick. Kelly Pelsma was a cast member in \"Licence to Drill,\" a reality TV series that followed rig hands drilling oil in Alberta, B.C. and the Northwest Territories. The show aired on Discovery Channel Canada from 2010 to 2014. A synopsis of the show says Pelsma worked on a rig in central Alberta. During the show's last season, Pelsma and the cast travelled to work at an oil site in Louisiana. Skye Nipshank of Calgary, a cast member who worked at a different site, said he was sorry to hear about the deaths. He said he knew Pelsma through Bonanza Drilling, the company Pelsmahad worked for. \"Kelly was a person who lived life to the fullest and all the people who had the chance to work with him knew he liked to work hard and play harder,\" Nipshank said in an online message. Joe Blakeman, reeve of Lac Ste. Anne County, said the Pelsma family was relatively new to the lake and might have not been familiar with the area. They bought property there in August, he said. A current runs below the bridge where their bodies were found, Blakeman said, and the water near it doesn't completely freeze over. \"It's always open water and it has been like that my whole life, 57 years,\" he said. \"It hasn't changed. \"The lakes, they're never 100 per cent safe, and you got to know where you're going and know what you're up against.\" He said there's a sign on the bridge warning people of the current and thin ice, but the sign hasn't been maintained in a while. \"I had a call from a couple summer villages yesterday and they're wondering if we should do something (about the sign),\" he said. \"This is definitely a tragedy. All the years I've been here, there have been trucks that have gone through the ice there, there have been snowmobiles. \"We've just never lost a life.\" Occhionero said he had planned to visit the Pelsmas this winter to go snowmobiling. He said others in the UTV community in Idaho have also reached out to to him about the tragedy. \"They were a great couple and great people who wanted to be friends with everybody.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.",

    "title": "Eve's Desire: Unrealistic expectations, killer of relationships, by Tiwa Says",
    "text": "A lot of people come into relationships with some kind of preconceived idea about how they’ll be treated and most of the time they are disappointed. This may be rooted in the fact that relationships are transactional these days. But most times it’s an unspoken trade.\nUnrealistic expectations by both parties are a significant relationship wrecker, silently undermining connection and fostering resentment.\nThey come from a variety of sources, including idealised romantic notions from the media, societal norms, personal insecurities, and unmet needs from past experiences. These expectations, when unmet, create a profound difference between reality and fantasy, leading to disappointment, conflict, and ultimately, relationship breakdown.\nAlso Read: Let’s explore some of these unrealistic expectations and how they manifest and damage relationships:\nTypes of Unrealistic Expectations:\nThe “Perfect Partner” Myth: Media often portrays relationships as effortless and idyllic, with partners perfectly complementing each other without conflict. This creates an unrealistic expectation that a partner will fulfill all needs and desires flawlessly, leading to disappointment when the inevitable imperfections and disagreements arise.\nInstant Gratification: Some individuals expect instant connection and deep intimacy, overlooking the time and effort required to build a strong relationship. This can lead to frustration and disillusionment when the relationship doesn’t progress as quickly as anticipated.\nSexual Expectations: The expectation itself isn’t an issue but when the two of you aren’t on the same page about it, things can get complicated.\nIf you assume that you and your partner will have sex three times a week without prior communication – and they’re thinking more in the lines of once a week or, the other extreme, five times a week – one or both of you will most likely be disappointed.\nMind Reading: Expecting your partner to intuitively understand your needs and desires without verbal communication is a recipe for disaster. Healthy relationships require open and honest communication; assuming your partner should “just know” leads to misunderstandings and resentment.\nUnchanging Partner: People change over time; expecting your partner to remain static in their personality, interests, or even physical appearance is unrealistic. Relationships require adaptation and growth; clinging to an idealised image of a partner from the past leads to conflict.\nEffortless Effort: Maintaining a healthy relationship requires consistent effort from both partners. Expecting a relationship to thrive without ongoing investment in communication, compromise, and shared activities is naive.\nProblem-Free Paradise: Conflicts are inevitable in any relationship. Expecting a relationship to be devoid of disagreements or challenges is unrealistic. Healthy relationships navigate conflict constructively; avoiding conflict altogether is unhealthy.\nAlways Available: Expecting constant attention and availability from your partner is unreasonable. Individuals need personal space and time for themselves; demanding constant connection can lead to feelings of suffocation and resentment.\nFriends Of Opposite Sex: Expecting your partner not to have friends of the opposite sex is just plain delusional. It is normal for both partners to have friends of the opposite sex, what’s important is to set boundaries that will guide such relationships.\nFinancial Expectations: Unrealistic expectations about finances can create significant stress. Expecting your partner to foot your every bill is a little extreme. Disagreements about spending habits, financial goals, or contributions to household expenses will definitely lead to conflict and resentment.\nRole Expectations: Traditional gender roles or expectations about household chores, childcare, or career aspirations can create conflict if not openly discussed and agreed upon. Healthy relationships require equitable distribution of responsibilities.\nHow Unrealistic Expectations Ruin Relationships:\nDisappointment and Resentment: When expectations are unmet, disappointment inevitably follows. This can lead to resentment, as one partner feels let down by the other’s perceived failures.\nCommunication Breakdown: Unrealistic expectations often prevent open and honest communication. Instead of expressing needs directly, individuals may become passive-aggressive or withdraw, further damaging the relationship.\nIncreased Conflict: Disagreements and conflicts become more frequent and intense when expectations are unrealistic. Partners may engage in blaming, criticism, and defensiveness, escalating the conflict.\nErosion of Trust: When one partner consistently fails to meet the other’s unrealistic expectations, trust erodes. This can lead to feelings of insecurity, suspicion, and betrayal.\nLoss of Intimacy: Unrealistic expectations can create distance and prevent intimacy from flourishing. Resentment, conflict, and lack of trust make it difficult to connect on an emotional or physical level.\nRelationship Termination: Ultimately, unmet unrealistic expectations can lead to the breakdown of the relationship. Constant disappointment, conflict, and lack of trust make it difficult to sustain the relationship.\nAddressing Unrealistic Expectations:\nSelf-Reflection: Identify your own unrealistic expectations. Examine the sources of these expectations (media, past experiences, personal insecurities) and challenge their validity.\nOpen Communication: Talk openly and honestly with your partner about your expectations. Listen to their perspective and work together to find common ground.\nRealistic Goals: Set realistic goals for your relationship. Acknowledge that relationships require effort, compromise, and the ability to navigate conflict constructively.\nManage Expectations: Learn to manage your expectations by focusing on the present moment and appreciating your partner for who they are, rather than who you want them to be.\nPractice Empathy: Try to understand your partner’s perspective and empathise with their challenges. Avoid making assumptions and engage in active listening.\nSeek Professional Help: If you’re struggling to manage unrealistic expectations, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counsellor. They can provide guidance and support in navigating relationship challenges.\nCultivating Realistic Expectations:\nEmbrace Imperfection: Accept that both you and your partner are imperfect. Focus on appreciating each other’s strengths and working together to overcome challenges.\nFocus on the Present: Instead of dwelling on the past or fantasising about the future, focus on the present moment and appreciate the good things in your relationship.\nPractice Gratitude: Express gratitude for your partner and the positive aspects of your relationship. This helps shift your focus from what’s lacking to what’s present.\nCelebrate Small Victories: Acknowledge and celebrate the small victories in your relationship. This helps build a sense of accomplishment and reinforces positive feelings.\nContinuous Growth: Relationships require continuous growth and adaptation. Be willing to learn and grow together, embracing change and navigating challenges as a team.\nIn conclusion, by understanding the nature of unrealistic expectations and actively working to cultivate realistic ones, you can significantly improve the health and longevity of your relationships. Remember that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, open communication, and a willingness to compromise and grow together.\nI would love to get feedback, questions and recommendations on the topics you would want me to shed light on.\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel: @Eve’s Desire Show, on YouTube at: @theeagleonlinenigeria.\nSend me a message on Telegram at: @tiwa_says; Whatsapp: 09161129108; and tiwalolaoke@yahoo.com.",

    "text": "River levels were expected to peak in the county today and into tomorrow after a battering from Storm Gerrit. Flood defences were put up in Shrewsbury and Ironbridge earlier this week as the Environment Agency prepared for the impact of the swollen River Severn. A flood warning issued for Shrewsbury on Thursday afternoon said that flooding of property, roads and farmland is \"expected\" and that the river is likely to peak at the Welsh Bridge on Friday evening. A flood warning was issued for The Quarry and The Showground in the county town on Thursday evening after a day of heavy rain. Levels in Crew Green and Shrewsbury were predicted to hit their peaks of 6m to 6.3m and 3.2m to 3.6m respectively today, with the water expected to work its way down the Severn to peak at 4.8m to 5.3m in Ironbridge and 4m to 4.4m Bridgnorth later today, and into tomorrow. It comes after the county was hit by extremely strong winds and rain from Storm Gerrit early yesterday morning. The storm uprooted trees and also appears to have been responsible for a huge 'bang', heard in Bridgnorth – with residents describing the noise as like an \"explosion\". The boom was heard around 10.50pm on Wednesday, and was accompanied by a bolt of lightning. Caroline King who lives in Low Town explained how it had even destroyed her internet connection. She said: \"There was a massive lightning bolt through my windows and then a massive bang. My WiFi router has blown from it. It is still out now and I won't be back online until next Wednesday, which affects me as I work from home. My power hasn't been affected but I believe it has been for a lot of residents in Low Town.\" Meanwhile the Environment Agency has urged people to take caution around the rising rivers amid the festive celebrations. Chris Bainger, the Environment Agency Fisheries Technical Specialist for Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, posted an update on social media saying: \"A reminder please, with the festive period coming please stay away from swollen rivers and standing water, it is not a safe place to be.\" A motorist also had to be freed by fire crews after their vehicle got stuck in water during heavy rain near Telford. The incident at around 1.30pm yesterday near the former Grove Inn pub in Walcot saw a fire crew from Wellington attend. A spokesman for the Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said the vehicle was hauled free from the water using the fire engine. Meanwhile flood warnings were still in place for Melverley and Maesbrook, with less severe flood alerts for the Rea Brook and Cound Brook, the Dee catchment from Whitchurch to Chester, the River Lugg north of Leominster, the Severn throughout Shropshire, and the Severn/Vyrnwy confluence and Tern and Perry Catchments. More rain is also forecast for this weekend. The Met Office says 2023 will end on an unsettled note with strong winds and rain returning to the UK. During the early hours of Saturday they say a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK. At the moment it doesn't look like snow will be a feature in the Midlands though. But they say a band of \"transient snow\" could be a feature further north.",

    "text": "[NPC1](/user/NPC1)a [lavanguardia.com](/go/link/3974042)\n¿Como de subnormal hay que ser para pagar por mostrar a una ciudad de un millón de habitantes lo subnormal que eres?\n[#4](c4#c-4) a mí esto me suena a felicidad impostada. A Mr Wonderfull, a querer tapar una fuga de agua con buenas intenciones, a Teletubbies modernos. Pero que sabré yo que soy un triste\n[#4](c4#c-4) Eso digo yo, otra cosa sería que lo hicieran con música en altavoces. Si a la gente no le importa hacer el ridículo, y se lo pasan bien así, por mi perfecto.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Depende de cuantos sean y por dónde pasen, supongo. Si se meten en medio de la plaza de la reina o delante del palau de la música y son 25 personas caben tranquilamente, pero si se meten esos mismos 25 en una acera de 3 metros como se ve en la captura... pues joden 15m de acera \"a su ritmo\" por la puta cara.\nHace años ya se liaron pollos con los segway, porque ni contaminan ni hacen ruido, pero cuando van unos cuantos juntos colapsan calles y cruces.\n[#14](c14#c-14) porque seguramente moleste al resto, tu ves un grupo de flipados bailando, te mererias en su camino? pasarias entre ellos? le dejarías paso a todos priorizandolos?\nTampoco hay que pensar mucho para darse cuenta que es una molestia\n[#4](c4#c-4) Pues sí. Esa parece la moda, criticar a una de las actividades que más ingresos generan en este país. Otra cosa que sí es criticable es la actitud de la gente, la mala educación, etc. Pero eso desgraciadamente lo padecemos a diario en todos los ámbitos, en el trabajo, en la calle, en el supermercado, etc. No es exclusivo del turismo. Pero vamos, que si tan malo es puede que tengamos que reorientar la producción hacia el sector primario.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Mucho amargado que no tiene un duro para irse de vacaciones y en vez de cagarse en la madre que pario a su empresa que le paga una mierda, se desahoga odiando turistas\n[#4](c4#c-4) Estoy de acuerdo pero... No es lo mismo una persona con auriculares bailando por la calle que un grupo de diez o veinte, con \"coreografías\" y ocupando todo el espacio. Sin ver ningún vídeo es difícil opinar, pero por lo leído tiene que ser un poquito incordiante.\n[#4](c4#c-4) No es quejarse por quejarse, mucha gente si, pero otros no tanto.\nVivo en mallorca y mi ingresos vienen gracias al turismo.\nAún así, hay que reconocer que no todo vale. Ya que hay actividades que pueden ser muy guays para los turistas pero realmente molestas para la gente que vive en la zona.\nPor ejemplo, aquí se han limitado los tours de buggies y motos de agua. Debido a que hacen un tour cada hora durante 8 horas por los mismos caminos y calas. Para la gente que vive en las zonas de paso es insoportable.\nY volviendo a la noticia, realmente es muy molesto los grupos de turistas. Como cruceristas, estos bailando, etc, debido a que no es lo mismo 50 turistas paseando a su bola que 50 turistas haciendo lo mismo, los segundos bloquean por completo.\nY el problema no es que haya 1 grupo, es que hay 3-4 grupos cada hora.\nLas críticas que yo defiendo son contra la masificación, no se puede todo para todos.\nEnésimo artículo de mierda sobre el tema cansino del verano para que la gente haga el clic correspondiente y el periódico gane dinerito, que está la cosa mu achuchá.\nHay que ser imbécil o tener un problema mental para que te moleste que haya gente bailando sin hacer ruido.\nA ver, si no molestan con auriculares no me parece mal. Que los frivolos guiris se diviertan como quieran.",

    "title": "When Transit Riders Refuse To Just Sit Back",
    "text": "Above photo: Illustration by Kazimir Iskander.\nThough public transportation is a vital resource for many, governments don’t always adequately invest in it. Transit rider unions can get us back on the right track.\nTran•Sit Ri•Der Un•Ions noun\n1. Organized groups that represent people who use public transportation\nSo, Like A Labor Union But For Transit Riders? Yep! Public transportation benefits everyone, and many people rely on buses and trains daily to get to work or school. But despite high-quality public transportation being so important for people and the planet, government doesn’t always adequately invest in it.\n“The analogy with labor unions is interesting because it’s obviously different in the sense that we don’t all work for the same employer, we can’t strike and bargain with our employer for benefits,” Katie Wilson said in 2012, six months after helping form the Seattle Transit Riders Union. ​“But it’s more of a political thing. This is the new working poor, organizing and trying to win political gains.”\nFrom inequitable service in Black and brown communities to excessive delays to service cuts, there’s a lot to organize around.\nWhat Do They Do? They try to build power to advocate for high-quality public transportation, with issue campaigns such as greater accessibility, free or reducedfares, more reliable service and electric buses. The idea is that, when politicians neglect public transportation (or actively make it worse), there’s a group of organized riders ready to hold them accountable.\nAre They Effective? They can be! Take the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union, for example. In 1994, it sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, alleging its funding policies discriminated against Black and Latino riders by spending more on trains than buses, which are primarily relied on by the city’s lower-income Black and brown residents.\nThe court ordered improvements for the buses, and through negotiations, an agreement was made to set a fare structure and fare increase procedure, increase bus service, replace old diesel buses and decrease overcrowding. The changes redistributed more than $ 2 . 5 billion to bus riders.\nBut Didn’t The System Eventually Return To Business As Usual? After 2003, the fares increased and bus hours were cut back— but several improvements remained. Which proves the point: We need mass action from organized groups if we hope to serve everyone and help fight the climate crisis, and transit rider unions make it harder for agencies to ignore the concerns of everyday people.\nThis is part of ​“The Big Idea,” a series offering brief introductions to progressive theories, policies, tools and strategies that can help us envision a world beyond capitalism.",
