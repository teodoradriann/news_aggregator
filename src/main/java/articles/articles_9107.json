    "title": "Portugal 2-1 Croatia: Ronaldo's 900th goal seals Nations League win",
    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo's 900th career goal proved the winner as Portugal saw off Croatia 2-1 in the Nations League. Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 900th career goal as Portugal edged Croatia 2-1 in Thursday's Nations League clash at Estadio da Luz. Ronaldo's 34th-minute goal proved the winner, as the Portugal captain turned in Nuno Mendes' cross for his milestone goal. Roberto Martinez's side led inside seven minutes through Diogo Dalot, and 39-year-old Ronaldo forced a brilliant reflex save out of Dominik Livakovic 15 minutes later. Livakovic was helpless to prevent Ronaldo putting Portugal ahead, though Dalot's own goal four minutes before half-time set up an exciting second period in the League A Group 1 contest. Yet despite shading the expected goals (xG) value in the second half, with 0.44 to Portugal's 0.36, Croatia found no way through, with Ronaldo going off to a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Portugal, the 2019 Nations League winners, will remain in Lisbon to welcome Scotland on Sunday while Zlatko Dalic's Croatia side will look to bounce back against Poland in Osijek on the second matchday. Data Debrief: Nine hundred not out Ronaldo was already the top scorer in the history of the game, and international football's record goalscorer added another to his remarkable tally to hit the 900 mark. It was his 131st for his country, on a night he had a joint team-high four shots, along with Bruno Fernandes. The rest of his goals have been split across his clubs: 450 for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United, 131 at Juventus, 68 for Al-Nassr, and five when he played for Sporting CP at the start of his career.",

    "title": "La humillación del PSOE en Navarra",
    "text": "Sin Perdón\nLa humillación del PSOE en Navarra\n«La inacción, como sucede en el PSOE, conduce a que un líder concentre todo el poder»\nNo hay duda de que llegar a final de mes es duro. Los dirigentes del PSOE en Navarra se han humillado al entregar Pamplona a Bildu. Lo han hecho con absoluta sumisión al inquilino de La Moncloa, porque se juegan mucho. No se pueden arriesgar a quedarse sin trabajo. Es una consecuencia del sistema partitocrático, porque ganan más en política que dedicándose a sus profesiones. No hay más que ver a Ramón Alzórriz que era técnico administrativo, una profesión muy respetable, pero peor retribuida y con menos proyección que ser diputado autonómico y secretario de Organización del PSN-PSOE. Es un ejemplo de una realidad que se extiende por los partidos y que, en algunos, como en el PSOE, resulta inquietante. La carrera política en Roma se basaba en el «cursus honorum», donde eran importantes el mérito y la capacidad. En el PSOE se reduce a la fidelidad al líder, la aceptación del populismo sanchista y la sumisión al aparato del partido. En caso contrario, no cabe otro camino que el ostracismo. Esto explica que los socialistas navarros hayan entregado Pamplona a los herederos de ETA.\nNo hay que sorprenderse, porque sucede lo mismo con la inconstitucional amnistía. Es cierto que Conde-Pumpido hará un zafio pumpidazo para blanquearla, pero pasará a la Historia como el jurista del régimen sanchista. Es una lástima que no tenga presente lo que sufrió García-Pelayo, que era un gran jurista, cuando se equivocó sometiéndose al felipismo en la sentencia de Rumasa. Por ello, abandonó la presidencia del TC y regresó a Venezuela arrepentido por el error que había cometido. Las democracias pueden evolucionar al autoritarismo democrático, que podría parecer un contrasentido, pero no lo es. Tocqueville utilizó el término «despotismo democrático» en su obra la «La democracia en América» para advertir de los riesgos que amenazan a las democracias. La inacción, como sucede en el PSOE, conduce a que un líder concentre todo el poder, se rodee de un grupo de fieles y el resto del partido asuma las mentiras como verdades o cambios de opinión. Con ello, se entierra el socialismo y se da paso al sanchismo.\nFrancisco Marhuendaes catedrático de Derecho Público e Historia de las Instituciones (UNIE)",

We demanded full transparency and ensured each supplement contained high-quality, natural ingredients with no hidden fillers or harmful additives. The purity of these nutritional supplements is paramount in our assessment, as it directly impacts their safety and effectiveness.\nClinically Backed Ingredients\nEach testosterone-boosting supplement was evaluated based on the presence of clinically backed ingredients. We delved into scientific studies and research, confirming that the constituents in these testosterone boosters are not only safe but also proven to address symptoms of low testosterone effectively.\nDosage Efficacy Of Testosterone Boosting Supplements\nComposition information, no doubt, is crucial. However, the efficacy of testosterone boosters hinges on their ingredient dosage. We meticulously analyzed whether these testosterone supplements contain adequate quantities of key ingredients, ensuring they align with the dosages validated by scientific research.\nSafety and Side Effect Profile\nSafety is non-negotiable. Our systematic review included an in-depth analysis of each testosterone booster’s side effect profile. We prioritized testosterone-boosting supplements that offer the benefits of elevating T levels without exposing users to undue risks.\nUser Testimonials and Reviews\nTestimonials and reviews offer invaluable insights into the real-world effectiveness of testosterone boosters. We sifted through countless user experiences, giving weight to testosterone supplements that have consistently received positive feedback for delivering tangible improvements in testosterone levels, energy, and overall well-being.\nManufacturing Standards\nThe manufacturing environment and practices play a critical role in the quality of testosterone boosters. We ensured that each testosterone-boosting supplement on our list was produced in facilities that adhered to stringent quality control standards, such as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certifications.\nBrand Reputation and Transparency\nThe reputation and transparency of the brand behind each testosterone booster were meticulously evaluated. We favored brands that maintain an open dialogue with their customers, offering clear and accessible information about their products, manufacturing processes, and customer support.\nValue and Cost-Efficiency\nLastly, we assessed the value proposition of top testosterone boosters, considering their price relative to their benefits.

The male body naturally produces testosterone. It’s crucial for male sexual development, playing a pivotal role in the development of male reproductive tissues, including the prostate and testes.\nTestosterone fosters secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and body hair growth. Beyond its physical attributes, it significantly influences libido, energy, mood, and cognitive functions. As men age, T levels naturally decline, often leading to a need for dietary and lifestyle adjustments or supplementation to maintain optimal health and well-being.\nWhat Can Lower Testosterone Levels?\nVarious factors can contribute to lowered testosterone levels, often leading to a condition known as hypogonadism or low testosterone. Age is a primary factor; as men age, a natural decline in T production occurs. However, other elements can also significantly impact T levels, affecting the testicles, pituitary gland, and thyroid.\nLifestyle choices play a crucial role; poor diet, lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking can all negatively affect T production. Stress is another critical factor, with chronic stress and inadequate sleep leading to elevated cortisol levels, which in turn can lower testosterone levels and cause problems like erectile dysfunction and poor libido.\nCertain medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and hormonal disorders, can also lower testosterone hormone. Additionally, exposure to endocrine disruptors in some plastics and personal care products can interfere with hormone production.\nUnderstanding these factors is essential for taking proactive steps to maintain healthy testosterone levels and overall well-being.\nCan Testosterone Boosters Help?\nTestosterone boosters can be beneficial for individuals experiencing low testosterone levels, offering a potential avenue to improve symptoms related to testosterone deficiency.\nNatural testosterone boosters work with the help of organic ingredients known to support the body’s T production, such as vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. While they can work by elevating energy production, enhancing muscle mass, improving libido, and boosting overall well-being, it’s essential to approach them with realistic expectations.\nAre Testosterone Boosters Safe?\nYes. T boosters are primarily safe for increasing testosterone in the male body. Though most of the testosterone-boosting supplements’ composition is not tested in any third-party laboratory, they have compounds that are clinically proven. Also, the best testosterone supplements above are made in an FDA-approved and GMP-certified facility, ensuring their safety and potency.\nThe Science Behind Testosterone Boosters\nTop T boosters claim to increase testosterone in the male body. But how? This is because of their composition of natural ingredients and plant extracts. Here are some of the common ingredients found in natural testosterone boosters:\nD-aspartic Acid\nD-aspartic acid is a natural amino acid that plays a crucial role in the synthesis and release of testosterone. It stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone, influencing the testes to produce more testosterone.\nStudies have suggested that d-aspartic acid supplementation can lead to a temporary increase in testosterone levels, which is particularly beneficial for those with low levels or athletes seeking performance enhancement. However, the effects of d-aspartic acid seem to be more pronounced in individuals with low testosterone, and continued research is needed to understand its impact fully.\nVitamin D\nVitamin D often hailed as the “sunshine vitamin,” is increasingly recognized for its role in T production. This fat-soluble vitamin acts as a steroid hormone, influencing bone health, immune function, and cell growth.\nWhile direct vitamin D supplementation may not drastically boost testosterone levels, maintaining adequate vitamin D status is essential for overall health and can support optimal hormonal balance.\nHorny Goat Weed\nHorny Goat Weed is a traditional Chinese herb renowned for its aphrodisiac properties and its potential to aid in enhancing sexual function. While scientific research on its direct effect on T levels is limited, it’s believed to contribute to overall sexual well-being.\nTribulus Terrestris\nTribulus Terrestris is a plant commonly used in traditional medicine to enhance sexual function and increase muscle mass. While Tribulus Terrestris is popularly included in testosterone boosters, scientific evidence supporting its ability to increase testosterone levels significantly is mixed.\nSome studies suggest Tribulus Terrestris may improve sexual health and enhance libido by increasing the release of nitric oxide, thereby improving blood flow rather than directly influencing testosterone levels.\nZinc\nZinc is essential for multiple bodily functions, including immune response, DNA synthesis, and cellular metabolism. Zinc plays a vital role in T production.\nZinc supplementation is required for the activity of enzymes that convert cholesterol into testosterone, and a zinc deficiency can lead to low testosterone levels.\nZinc supplementation can be beneficial, particularly for those with a deficiency, leading to a potential improvement in testosterone levels and overall reproductive health.\nPanax Ginseng\nPanax Ginseng, often called Korean Ginseng, is a well-known adaptogen used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s believed to help the body resist stress and enhance physical and mental performance.\nWhile research on its direct impact on T levels is limited, Panax Ginseng may contribute to improved reproductive function and increased energy production. Its active compounds, ginsenosides, are thought to support nitric oxide production, enhancing blood flow and potentially improving erectile function.\nWhat Are The Symptoms of Low Testosterone?\nSymptoms of low testosterone can manifest in various physical and emotional changes. Men with less testosterone may experience hair loss on the scalp and body. Reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased semen volume are common reproductive symptoms.\nFatigue, loss of muscle mass, increased fat, and reduced bone density signal changes in physical strength and body composition.

    "text": "The battery market for electric construction, agriculture, and mining (CAM) machines is expected to reach US$8 billion by 2034. Electric CAM machines promise health, environmental, and productivity benefits, while also acting as long-term financial investments for companies. These machines come in a number of shapes, sizes, and weights, and require a wide variety of batteries to suit their many functions. IDTechEx’s latest report, “ Battery Markets in Construction, Agriculture & Mining Machines 2024-2034 ”, explores options for different battery chemistries in accordance with the requirements of various machines.\nThe ‘whys’ behind the rise of electrification\nLocal air quality improvements, lowered greenhouse gas emissions, safer work environments, and less pollutants are all advantages of CAM machine electrification. Despite these machines carrying high initial costs, the reduced diesel and maintenance costs over time will make them a good investment within these industries. Additionally, operators can expect further benefits, such as faster system responses, improved control, and easier operation.\nExcavators, loaders, and mini excavators make up around three-quarters of the construction machine market. However, the popularity and size of large excavators (>6 tonnes) specifically means they are huge emitters of greenhouse gases. IDTechEx reports that almost half of the total emissions from construction machines come from these alone. While mini excavators may be easier to electrify, making the larger ones electric still stands as a huge goal in the hope of greatly reducing emissions. Within the mining sector, the main vehicles set for electrification include dump trucks, haul trucks, and mining light vehicles, while tractors see the most electrification within the agriculture sector.\nThe installation of charging infrastructure on work sites, alongside the question of whether these machines will be able to complete a full day of work on one charge, are factors to be considered before making the leap from engine to electric. There is also limited push from governments to make these changes, meaning a lack of subsidies and support may make initial costs a bit too high.\nBattery types and requirements for CAM machines\nPower demands vary from machine to machine, meaning batteries won’t be a one-size-fits-all solution. Batteries need to be faster charging for CAM machines than everyday electric cars to minimize downtime and ensure they can complete their work promptly. Cells that can be charged quickly might ordinarily have reduced energy density, but with technologies including high silicon content anodes and solid-state electrolytes, higher energy density could be available alongside faster charging capabilities.\nWith data collected from over 200 electric CAM machines across different markets, IDTechEx provides suggestions for which battery types would be best suited to various machines, determined by how much energy per tonne per hour each machine uses. LFP and NMC chemistries are the main battery types currently in use as they have been popular within the automotive industry. According to IDTechEx’s latest batteries for CAM machines report , tractors are the most energy-intensive machines, using around 50% more energy per hour than most other CAM machines; as such, they require much larger batteries than something like a mining light vehicle.\nNew battery chemistries such as lithium titanate (LTO) could be a good option for ensuring fast charging doesn’t lead to faster wearing or decreased longevity. The introduction of new anode materials, such as LTO, could see an electric machine lasting more than 10,000 cycles on one battery, without replacement. By contrast, leading NMC and LFP technologies offer up to ~5,000 cycles before reaching their end of life. Having a 10,000+ cycle battery would mean huge cost and convenience advantages for companies employing them.\nSolid-state batteries for increased safety\nSolid electrolytes may improve the safety of a cell, which is critical for electric CAM machines, so solid-state batteries could be another promising future option. This could be a crucial development for machines working underground or indoors, such as underground loaders or mini excavators. Solid-state batteries could also provide an increased energy density so that machines can more comfortably fulfill their duty cycle demands. This battery chemistry, however, comes with challenges during the manufacturing process, such as ensuring high-quality electrolytes are thin enough, as well as maintaining a good connection between electrolytes and electrodes.\nIDTechEx’s report covers 10 different future battery options for CAM machines, as well as exploring which chemistries are available in different regions. While Europe and North America most commonly use NMC, LFP is more common in China, with Europe and China predicted to see LTO batteries employed first. With the wide variety of weights, sizes, and use cases of CAM machines, LFP and NMC might no longer be the best options, with emerging technologies, including silicon anode, solid-state, and sodium-ion, predicted to be amongst the best. The report includes details on product offerings from over 40 different pack manufacturers and assemblers, and tables that benchmark products against different performance indicators.\nFor more information, please see the IDTechEx report, “ Battery Markets in Construction, Agriculture & Mining Machines 2024-2034 ”.
