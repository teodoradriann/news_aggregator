A la vez que sigue la brutalidad israelí, continúan condenas internacionales sobre el particular. Las reacciones vinieron desde la acusación directa a occidente por provocar tensiones en Asia Occidental. Rusia fue uno de los más tajantes, por lo que culpó a Estados Unidos de realizar acciones so pretexto de solucionar sus problemas a costa de la sangre de otras naciones, así acentuó el canciller ruso, Serguei Lavrov, en el marco de su entrevista con la agencia de noticias TASS.\nAl ser preguntado sobre la posición de Moscú sobre la masacre israelí, el jefe de la diplomacia enfatizó en que la fórmula es encontrar una paz duradera.\nEn la misma línea, la ONU en un informe denuncia una serie de violaciones a los derechos humanos ocurridas en Gaza, así como en la Cisjordania ocupada, alertando a Israel a detener los homicidios cometidos. En cuanto a España y en un tono similar, el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, en un encuentro con el primer ministro de Irak, Mohamed Shia al-Sudani, señaló su rechazo profundo por el exterminio israelí.\nA la vez que se publican reacciones más severas, también siguen las marchas más potentes, una de ellas en Washington, donde los marchantes provocaron interrupciones significativas en dos de los aeropuertos más concurridos de Estados Unidos. Mientras, la situación en Gaza sigue siendo efímera, y los esfuerzos por alcanzar una tregua parecen todo un desafío para la comunidad internacional.\nhae/rba",

    "text": "Recientemente, se realizó un impactante descubrimiento arqueológico en Francia. A partir del trabajo que llevó a cabo el Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Arqueológicas Preventivas de Francia (INRAP, por sus siglas en francés), se hallaron los restos de la basílica funeraria de Gregorio de Tours: Saint-Jean. Allí dentro, se registraron restos de humanos y una serie de objetos que llamaron la atención. Durante el último tiempo, el avance de la arqueología permitió conocer todo tipo de detalles sobre el pasado. A partir de la sofisticación de las herramientas y de la metodología de trabajo que llevan a cabo los investigadores, cada vez se conocen más aspectos sobre la historia y la vida que se desarrolló en otros siglos. En este caso, la excavación de la basílica funeraria fue organizada en conjunto por el INRAP y el municipio. A pesar de que fue ampliamente modificada por el paso de los años desde su construcción original, en el siglo VI, se encontraron restos que aún permanecen bajo los cimientos. En lo que respecta al edificio en sí, se halló mampostería que deja ver cómo era el edificio anteriormente. Más allá de eso, lo más interesante para los investigadores estuvo en las tumbas que se desenterraron, las cuales, de acuerdo a lo que informó la entidad francesa mediante su sitio web oficial, corresponden a entierros que comenzaron a llevarse a cabo a partir del siglo XI. En esa misma línea, también se destacaron unos sarcófagos de arenisca. A pesar de que esto capturó la atención de los investigadores, lo más impactante tuvo que ver con restos humanos. Al abrir uno de los sarcófagos, aparecieron tres esqueletos, que, como bien se mencionó sobre la época en la que empezaron los entierros, podrían tener hasta 1.000 años. Además, también sorprendió la colocación de tres cuerpos en un solo espacio, algo que se explica por el costo que tenía construirlos",
