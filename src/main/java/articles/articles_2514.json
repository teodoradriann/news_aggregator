    "text": "The friendship between China and Bangladesh is expected to be enhanced after the two countries established a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership on Wednesday during the latter's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Beijing, experts say.\nThe visit, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, is \"a renewal of all the excellent relations of cooperation and friendship\" between the two countries, said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, Bangladesh's former ambassador to China.\nAhmad stressed the significance of Hasina's visit, her first to China since her new term began in January, and five years after her last visit to the country, saying Bangladesh's cooperation and friendship with China are continuously improving.\n\" (Bangladesh-China) cooperation has always been based on mutual benefit, mutual respect and mutual trust,\" Ahmad said. \"When countries in the region continue to prosper and do well, it is always a positive thing for regional peace and stability.\"\nMustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, said the Bangladesh-China relationship \"is one of our defining partnerships\".\nIn the 49 years since establishing diplomatic ties, China and Bangladesh have achieved significant cooperation in various fields.\nChina has been Bangladesh's biggest trading partner for 13 consecutive years, and as of last year, Chinese investments in Bangladesh totaled $3.2 billion, ranking China as the country's second-largest source of foreign investment.\nAccording to the Chinese embassy, nearly 1,000 Chinese companies operate in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 job opportunities.\nBangladesh is keen to attract Chinese investment, Rahman said, adding that he believes a special economic zone for Chinese investors and a free-trade agreement between the two countries will be conducive to Bangladesh's economy.\nIn 2016, Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to join China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nRahman said Bangladesh is also interested in key projects such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, investment and trade and technology transfer.\nShahab Enam Khan, a professor of the Department of International Relations at the Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka, said not only will Bangladesh profit from Chinese investment, but other regional countries will also benefit from the shared economic effect and infrastructure connectivity.\n\"The Bangladesh-China relationship should not be seen through the myopic prism of geopolitics,\" Khan said. \"It should be seen through the prism of development and growth of the 170 million population in Bangladesh.\"\nPeople who criticize Bangladesh for falling into the \"debt trap\" of China need to see Bangladesh's growth momentum, Khan said.\nBilateral relationship will continue to grow because of common economic and market interests, Khan added.\nAbdus Salam Aref, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh, said he hopes to see more investment from China in the tourism sector.\nIn May, ATAB co-organized a \"China Tourism Day\" promotion event. Aref said an increasing number of people in Bangladesh are becoming more interested in traveling to China.\nDuring Hasina's visit, the two countries agreed to designate next year as the \"China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges\".\nAref said people-to-people exchanges between Bangladesh and China will further grow with improved connectivity and more business cooperation.",

    "text": "The Niazi brothers have not only preserved the traditional essence of Qawwali but have also managed to infuse it with contemporary relevance, writes GYANESHWAR DAYAL Immersed in the mysticism of Sufi music, the Niazi Brothers stand as luminaries in the realm of Qawwali, weaving a tapestry of tradition and innovation Sufi music, with its ethereal melodies and profound lyrics, transcends the boundaries of time and culture, reaching deep into the human soul. Rooted in the mystical traditions of Sufism, this genre resonates with listeners by invoking a sense of spiritual awakening and emotional connection. The timeless appeal of Sufi music lies in its ability to convey universal themes of love, devotion, and the quest for divine union, making it a poignant and enduring form of artistic expression that continues to captivate audiences across generations. The Niazi Brothers, the well-known exponents of Sufi music are always a delight to watch performing on stage. Theirs is an acclaimed Qawwali group, which has carved a niche in the rich tapestry of Sufi music. Originating from a lineage deeply rooted in this spiritual genre, the brothers have not only preserved the traditional essence of Qawwali but have also managed to infuse it with contemporary relevance, ensuring its survival and growth in the fast-paced, ever-evolving world of music. A Journey through Sufi music The Niazi Brothers, hailing from Pakistan, are renowned for their powerful and evocative performances that capture the very essence of Qawwali. The group's roots can be traced back to the renowned Patiala Gharana, known for its distinctive style and musical prowess. Growing up in a family where music was as essential as air, the brothers were immersed in the world of Qawwali from a young age, learning the intricacies and subtleties of the genre from their forebears. Their father, Ustad Allah Rakha, was a renowned Qawwali singer who instilled in them a deep respect for the traditional forms and the spiritual messages conveyed through their music. This early education laid a strong foundation, allowing the Niazi Brothers to develop a profound understanding of both the technical and emotional aspects of Qawwali. However, the Niazi Brothers' rise to prominence was not an overnight success but a journey of relentless dedication and passion. Their performances are characterised by a deep emotional connection, powerful vocals, and a mastery of the harmonium and tabla, all of which are central to the Qawwali experience. The brothers have performed on numerous prestigious stages around the world, captivating audiences with their dynamic energy and spiritual depth. Their repertoire includes classical Qawwalis that date back centuries, as well as more contemporary pieces that reflect current social and spiritual themes. This blend of old and new has helped them reach a diverse audience, from traditionalists who appreciate the purity of their classical renditions to younger listeners who find resonance in their modern interpretations. The Future of Qawwali in a Fast-Paced World As the world hurtles forward with technological advancements and shifting cultural landscapes, the future of Qawwali faces both challenges and opportunities. The Niazi Brothers are acutely aware of this dynamic and have been proactive in adapting to the changing times while preserving the core essence of their music. One significant avenue they have explored is the digital realm. Through social media platforms, streaming services, and online concerts, the Niazi Brothers have reached a global audience that transcends geographical boundaries. These platforms have allowed them to share their music with fans who might never have had the opportunity to experience a live Qawwali performance, thereby expanding the genre's reach and relevance. Moreover, collaborations with artists from different musical backgrounds have also played a crucial role in keeping Qawwali vibrant and relevant. By blending traditional Qawwali with contemporary music styles, the Niazi Brothers have created a unique fusion that appeals to a broader audience. This fusion not only keeps the tradition alive but also introduces its profound spiritual and emotional depth to new listeners. Preserving Tradition While Embracing Innovation The Niazi Brothers's approach to the future of Qawwali is a delicate balance of preservation and innovation. They remain deeply committed to the traditional aspects of Qawwali, understanding that its true power lies in its authenticity and spiritual roots. At the same time, they are not afraid to experiment and incorporate new elements that resonate with today's audiences. Education and mentorship also form a significant part of their vision for the future. By teaching young musicians the art of Qawwali, the Niazi Brothers are ensuring that this ancient tradition is passed down to future generations. They conduct workshops and training sessions, sharing their knowledge and passion with aspiring Qawwals, thus creating a new generation of musicians who can carry the torch forward. The journey of the Niazi Brothers is a testament to the enduring power of Qawwali. Through their dedication, talent, and willingness to innovate, they have kept this ancient form of spiritual music alive and thriving. As the world continues to change at a rapid pace, the Niazi Brothers stand as guardians of a rich musical heritage, ensuring that the soul-stirring strains of Qawwali continue to resonate across the globe for generations to come.",

    "text": "First Alert 6 Weather day: Freezing drizzle after 4pm Friday; slick roads likely\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Today is a FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY due to the threat of freezing drizzle that develops after 4pm and becomes more widespread as the night goes on.\nTemperatures will struggle to warm from the cold start in the lower teens. Clouds are likely to increase and get in the way of any significant warming too. A high of about 31 may be the best we can do in the metro and that may not happen until closer to midnight.\nFreezing drizzle chance will keep going up tonight with a light glaze coating things more and more after sunset.\nWidespread areas of 0.1″ of ice is what many of us can expect by the end of this event but a few spots north of I-80 could see higher amounts. The greatest likelihood for those look to be in West Central Iowa.\nWe should be able to warm just above 32 by sunrise Saturday at the latest but there will still be chilly showers on the map. There could even be some lingering freezing rain north of I-80 to start Saturday further adding to the icing totals. We’ll warm to 36 by the afternoon and that should melt the ice.\nHighs by Sunday will be much warmer up into the 40s with hopefully a little sun breaking through.\nCopyright 2024 WOWT.

Équipé de technologies de pointe, l’USS New Jersey est conçu pour répondre aux exigences modernes de la Marine, avec des capacités de furtivité améliorées et une polyvalence accrue. Propulsé par un réacteur nucléaire de 280 000 chevaux et des turbines à vapeur, il peut atteindre des vitesses impressionnantes. Capable de rester immergé pendant de longues périodes, il peut atteindre une profondeur de jusqu’à 240 mètres et se caractérise par sa capacité opérationnelle adaptable. Concernant les armements à bord, les sous-marins Virginia possèdent de missiles de croisière Tomahawk, de missiles antinavires Harpoon ainsi que de torpilles, en fonction de leur configuration. Tests réussis pour l’USS New Jersey La mise en service de l’USS New Jersey renforce la flotte de sous-marins de classe Virginia, qui a été lancée pour remplacer les anciens navires de la classe Los Angeles. Après avoir [terminé avec succès](https://hii.com/news/hii-completes-initial-sea-trials-of-virginia-class-submarine-new-jersey-ssn-796/) ses premiers essais en mer, l’USS New Jersey est prêt à rejoindre la flotte de la Marine américaine. Les tests rigoureux et la collaboration entre les équipes de construction ont permis de garantir la qualité et la fiabilité de ce nouveau navire de guerre. Implications stratégiques et impact économique du sous-marin de classe Virginia La construction du SSN 796 a mobilisé environ 10 000 employés et de fournisseurs à travers le pays, contribuant ainsi à stimuler l’économie et à soutenir l’industrie de la défense. En outre, le SSN 796 est le premier sous-marin Virginia conçu avec une intégration de genre, marquant une avancée significative vers l’égalité et la diversité au sein de l’US Navy. Alors que l’USS New Jersey entre en service, l’US Navy continue de moderniser sa flotte de sous-marins montrant un engagement envers l’innovation de la technologie navale.",

En ese momento, ella perdió el conocimiento no recordando que pasó justo después.\n.......\nEl joven se negó y ambos acusados se abalanzaron sobre él, agrediéndole en el rellano\ndel portal con cuchillos, machetes y una barra metálica. Tras agredirle, decidieron orinar\nencima suya.\nÉl consiguió avisar a la policía y los agresores huyeron. Uno de ellos fue detenido en las cercanías de la vivienda con una barra de hierro en la mano y declaró que la llevaba porque había participado en una pelea por un asunto de drogas.\nMomentos después detuvieron al otro presunto agresor, quien supuestamente había rajado la cara del joven con un machete. Ambas víctimas reconocieron a sus agresores y explicaron a los agentes que ya los conocían y que les habían amenazado varias veces con anterioridad.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Ver la realidad es racista? o racista es la carta excusa para no querer ver la realidad?\nMira las estadísticas que son preocupantes, luego saldrá la extrema derecha y todos nos meternos las manos en la cabeza.\nSi soy Racista por ver la realidad y denunciarla me importa poco que me lo llamen. pero almenos no seré un hipocrita\n[#36](c36#c-36) La realidad es que relacionáis estas agresiones con los migrantes y utilizáis el término jovenlandia o jovenlandés irónicamente para mofaros.\nEn la noticia, que igual ni habéis leído, habla claramente de la nacionalidad de los presuntos agresores. No los trata de jóvenes.\nLas estadísticas son sólo eso, estadísticas, que se pueden manipular para argumentar a nuestro favor.\nSi estás orgulloso de ser un xenófobo racista, allá tú. Ese cáncer no es fácil de curar.\n[#45](c45#c-45) No es así,\nLa realidad es que cada vez hay agresiones mas violentas que misteriosamente vienen siempre del mismo grupo de gente, posiblemente porque en sus países eso es normal, pero no aquí.\nEn las noticias ya no esconden la nacionalidad porque salen noticias de agresiones y palizas cada 2x3 y no puedes esconder un problema de manera indefinida.\nLas estadísticas no son solo eso, cuando interesa si importan, cuando destacan una realidad ya están manipuladas.\nY orgulloso no, lo que no soy es un hipócrita, que alguien como tu me llame racista o xenófobo me la resbala bastante porque son ataques genéricos que se usan cuando alguien no piensa como tu.\n[#31](c31#c-31) no lo va a hacer. Esto se está convirtiendo en un nido de trolls de ultraderecha, patétitos pseudomeneantes que cuando se les reporta, se crean otra cuenta, para poder esparcir su mierda, y que haya la sensación de peligro, de que el racismo es necesario, que los moros deberian vivir en morolandia (jovenlandia le llaman ahora estos xenófobos).\nAsco por todos los poros.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Yo soy de izquierda y estoy en contra de esta mierda y considero que debemos tener un control migratorio 500 veces mas estricto y, si es necesario, sacar patrulleras del ejercito a las costas de Canarias y el sur de España. La derecha no creo que fuera a hacer mucho por solucionar el problema, y de hacerlo traeria otros con su clasica corrupcion desmedida, pero es otro asunto. El tema es que es vergonzoso que la izquierda se tape los ojos a estos problemas, se te etiquete como racista al evidenciar hechos y que todo este sector quiera tener esta filosofia de puertas abiertas y considerarse buena persona o moralmente superior por ello, como si al ser de izquierdas no pudieras prescindir de comprar todo el pack actual. Las politicas migratorias son la principal causa que me tira para atras a la hora de votarles, y mira que apoyo muchas de las otras cosas que hacen, pero no quiero ser participe de esta. Sufri, y sufro aun, a un nutrido grupo de jovenlandeses en mi ciudad, los cuales tratan de entrar con cierta frecuencia a mi taller, y probablemente vinieron ilegalmente.\n[#43](c43#c-43) Pues por aquí hay quien te negativiza y te llama racista y/o fache en cuanto sugieres que esta gente no debería permanecer en nuestro país o cuando pides que se endurezca el control de fronteras. Y luego otros dicen que tenemos leyes muy duras, pero escoria como la de la noticia campa por el país a sus anchas y seguramente no sean de los que más impuestos pagan…\n[#35](c35#c-35) prepárate para la que te viene, de xenófobo/racista no bajas. Y, por supuesto, el carnet de izquierda retirado, seguro que eres un troll de esos que votas a vox.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Tú sin embargo eres inocente.\nEres tan inocente que te cuentan 2 milongas, te las crees y te conviertes en un robot que les hace el trabajo sucio.\nSeguro que eres de los que piensan que todos los problemas, por complejos que sean, se solucionan de una forma rápida y eficaz... preferiblemente con mano dura.\n[#15](c15#c-15) El día que esto se lo hagan a un juez o a alguien de su familia empezarán a ver la justicia de otra manera.\n¿Con todo ese relato el juez les deja en libertad?\n[#15](c15#c-15) Luego nos quejamos de que nos riamos de expresiones como \"Son nuestros niños\". \"Son sus costumbres y hay que respetarlas\". A ver lo que tarda la progrinquisición meneameica en vulnerar el artículo 20 de la Constitución por expresar libremente mis ideas.

    "text": "Unions racked up major 2023 wins for family-wage jobs in multiple sectors, setting stage for 2024 January 1, 2024By Kimberly Heatherington OSV News Filed Under: Feature, News, Social Justice, World News In the past 12 months, an extraordinary level of nationwide activity — organizing, strikes, negotiations and new contracts — has signaled increased influence for American labor unions, which once counted 21 million U.S. workers among their ranks. But any widespread union resurgence still faces challenges of low membership, weak labor laws and intense corporate resistance, several labor experts told OSV News. “The year that is just coming to an end is one of the most important in the history of the labor movement in the past three or four decades,” said Joseph McCartin, executive director of the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University in Washington. People protest in front of InterContinental Hotel as unionized hotel workers in Los Angeles and Orange County go on strike in Los Angeles, Calif., July 2, 2023. (OSV News photo/David Swanson, Reuters) “And what makes it so important are the big strikes that happened this year — the auto workers, the screen actors, the screenwriters, the threatened strike of the Teamsters. In all of those cases, you could say the unions made important gains,” McCartin reflected. “I don’t think there’s been a year like this where private sector unions like these have done as well — in a single year — in a very long time.” Indeed, 2023 witnessed a sharp rise in union activity, with strikes and other labor developments in multiple sectors — including media, parcel and food delivery, aerospace, auto and steel production, retail, hospitality, education and health care. Preliminary U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate some 444,850 American workers participated in work stoppages from January to October. After striking 148 days, the Writers Guild of America — the union representing film, television, radio and online media writers — reached a Sept. 26 deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers negotiators for Hollywood’s largest production companies. Higher wages and health and pension contribution rates were achieved, as well as new residual payments for streaming content. Additionally, there were assurances artificial intelligence, or AI, won’t be used to write or rewrite material, nor will AI-generated material be considered source material. The United Auto Workers labor strike against the “Big Three” car producers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, whose 14 automotive brands include Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep — ended Oct. 30 with a series of contracts experts said emphasize the importance of unions in Catholic social teaching, especially for achieving family wages through collective action. “Both Teamster UPS drivers and UAW auto workers at the Big Three began to undo years of wage and benefit concessions and make sure that these remain good, family-supporting jobs,” said Clayton Sinyai, executive director of the Catholic Labor Network. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis made a combined $21 billion in profits during the first six months of 2023, and a quarter-trillion dollars in North American profits during the last 10 years. Health care workers strike in front of Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles in Los Angeles Oct. 4, 2023. The strike lasted three days in several states and was the largest health care workers’ strike in U.S. history. A tentative agreement was finally reached, with union members voting on ratification in elections taking place Oct. 18-Nov. 3. (OSV News photo/Aude Guerrucci, Reuters) “All three agreements break records and better unite our union,” the UAW announced in a statement. Included were higher wages and wage progression; cost-of-living allowances; retirement improvements; and an historic right to strike over plant closures. Less than two weeks later on Nov. 9, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA, claimed a significant victory. Film and scripted TV had ground to a halt, delaying movie releases and stopping paychecks for thousands of working actors. “The huge wage increases are important — not only in the wake of the devastation many peoples’ livelihoods (experienced) during the pandemic and recession,” observed Dan Cornfield, professor of sociology, political science and American studies at Vanderbilt University’s Curb Center for Art, Enterprise and Public Policy. “They also counter a very long-term trend in the widening income gap — the gap between the haves and the have-nots — that, at least in recorded statistical history, has been occurring since 1968,” said Cornfield, who also is a fellow of the Labor and Employment Relations Association. With the largest contract-on-contract gains in the history of the union, the agreement included over $1 billion in new wages and benefit plan funding; “unprecedented” provisions for consent and compensation “that will protect members from the threat of AI”; and a streaming participation bonus. Actors had protested that as studios’ streaming revenues surged, their own incomes cratered due to imbalanced residual payments. “Starting in 2021, the labor mobilization in various sectors seems to have encouraged mobilization in other sectors,” Cornfield said. “It remains to be seen now if the recent UAW victories in collective bargaining will spill over into new organizing in the nonunion automotive sector of the United States. So that’s the next big challenge for the UAW.” On Nov. 1, Toyota announced it would be raising wages for its nonunionized factory workers — a move largely seen as preemptive, given the UAW’s expected effort to unionize Toyota plants. “They want to avoid the union,” McCartin explained. “And they hope that by raising wages, they can just say, ‘Hey, you don’t have to be in the union. If they win something, we’ll give you a little piece.'” That may not, however, be enough. “The workers might be getting to the point where they think, ‘Well, wait a minute — you mean you could always have afforded to give us more, and you just didn’t? Maybe we need to be organized, to be able to make sure we get a better deal,'” suggested McCartin. The Catholic Church has an extensive history of teaching and actions supporting the rights of workers, and both popes and prelates have spoken directly to the issue of unions and strikes. Pope Francis has said “there are no free workers without trade unions.” St. John Paul II also stated in his 1981 encyclical “Laborem Exercens” that “workers should be assured the right to strike” — a position echoed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ 1986 pastoral letter “Economic Justice for All,” which teaches, “Unions may also legitimately resort to strikes where this is the only available means to the justice owed workers.” More recently, Archbishop Borys A. Gudziak of the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia — chairman of the USCCB’s Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development — said in an Aug. 30 Labor Day statement that labor unions are “essential” to the thriving of working families. Still, if there is indeed strength in numbers, the potency of U.S. unions — despite a spate of new contracts — ultimately remains compromised. “Organized workers represent only about 10 percent of the workforce, and those who seek to organize continue to face an uphill fight, even at our Catholic institutions,” Sinyai commented. “Witness how management at Ascension St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore responded when nurses sought to form a union there.” Nurses at St. Agnes Hospital reported threats from management, and attempts to stifle the union campaign. “And don’t forget the Starbucks workers,” reminded Sinyai, “who have organized more than 300 locations but have yet to win a first contract from a company determined to stamp out their union.” Anemic labor laws — with insignificant attached penalties for their violation — too easily enable corporate opposition to worker unionization efforts, scholars say. The right to organize is guaranteed by the 88-year-old National Labor Relations Act. “One of the things that will come into play determining whether this becomes a trend or not … is the weakness of the law,” McCartin said. “That’s another thing that became very clear over the course of 2023.” McCartin also cited Starbucks as an example. “They were winning election after election by huge margins in their stores. However, they’ve not been able to get anywhere in negotiating their first contract. And that’s because the law really doesn’t require that,” he said. “Starbucks pushed back hard — as the National Labor Relations Board has pointed out — by doing things to undermine the union and to fight it,” McCartin emphasized. “So that legal weakness — in terms of legal protections for workers to actually get contracts from their employers — remains a stubborn obstacle to overcome. The big gains in 2023 happened where workers are already in unions. Can unions spread to new places? That’s what we’ll have to wait to find out.” Cornfield agreed. “Corporations often are slow to engage in collective bargaining. It’s been difficult to reach a first contract in many cases,” he said. “There have been a lot of corporate counter-attacks against the unions, in terms of either recognizing the union, or just not bargaining.” Challenges to unions can also be — despite popular perception — politically bipartisan. “The labor movement will have to put more pressure on the Biden administration, which sometimes caves in to corporate power,” said John Trumpbour, research director at Harvard Law School’s Center for Labor and a Just Economy. “Railway workers pushed for seven days of paid sick leave, and Team Biden and the U.S. Congress let them down,” said Trumpbour, who also is a steering committee member of Catholic Scholars for Worker Justice. “Ultimately, it will take an aggressive labor movement to build upon the victories of 2023,” Trumpbour suggested. “But to predict the future accurately, one has to shape the future by mobilizing people and movements. Labor cannot rest complacent after recent victories.” “It could be,” said McCartin, “a very, very big year to come for labor.” Read More Social Justice Women religious gear up for battle against human trafficking with prayer, education Pope tells Marxist group good policies cannot be dictated by the market First woman named to key Philadelphia archdiocesan post inspired by faith of other women Memorial services around country honor fallen homeless Catholic experts say rule to let franchise employees join unions would be major labor advance Baltimore City’s inclusive housing a triumph for Catholic activism Copyright © 2024 OSV News Print",

    "title": "Applications for law school up an 'unnatural' 35% from 2023",
    "text": "Applications for law school up an 'unnatural' 35% from 2023\nIt’s shaping up to be very competitive year for aspiring law students, with the number of applicants to law school jumping 25% and applications to law schools up a whopping 35% over a year ago, according to the Law School Admission Council’s [latest figures](https://report.lsac.org/VolumeSummary.aspx).\n“It’s unnatural. Demographically, there are no more college students graduating this year than there were last year,” says school admissions consultant Mike Spivey of Spivey Consulting.\nThe large increases can be attributed, in part, to the delay of last year’s application cycle, as many law schools waited to adjust their essay and personal statement sections after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision to [bar race as a consideration](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/supreme-court-rules-on-affirmative-action) in higher education admissions, says Susan Krinsky, LSAC interim president and CEO.\n“Last year’s slow start means that year-to-year comparisons at this early stage may overstate the growth in applicants,” she says.\nThere is still a long way to go in the admissions season. In 2024, the number of applicants on Dec. 4 accounted for 39% of the ultimate total, according to the LSAC.\nBut Spivey says as time passes and admissions season ends, the increase in applicants could land closer to 15%, he told the ABA Journal. He says some students rushed to take it while the “logic games” were still on the Law School Admissions Test, he adds. The deductive reasoning section made its [last appearance](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/lsat-scraps-logic-games-add-more-logical-reasoning) on the LSAT in June, and it was replaced with a second reading comprehension section or logical reasoning questions starting in August.\n“Anyone who was good at the logic games rushed to take the LSAT over the summer. Then the people who were bad at it took it in September and November, so you have this huge frontloading effect,” he adds. “It’s why the numbers are so crazy up now.”\n[An extra day](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/increased-interest-in-lsat-forces-an-additional-test-date) was added to the June administration of the LSAT to accommodate the increase in demand. In addition, registration for November’s test had 33,103 registered test-takers, up from 23,798 a year earlier, according to the LSAC.\nKrinsky disagrees that the change in the test caused more people to apply. “I don’t think you decide to go to law school because of one section of the LSAT,” she says. She noted that bump in applicants echos a similar[ jump in 2021](https://report.lsac.org/View.aspx?Report=HistoricalData). “It goes in cycles,” she says.\nAlso, election years typically elicit more interest in attending law schools.\n“In any election, we see people thinking about policy shifts they’d like to see in ways that they can make an impact,” says Maya Russell, prelaw advisor at Furman University and chair of the Pre-Law Advisor National Council.\nWhile all regions experienced a minimum 25% increase in applications, the South Central region had the highest jump with 54.2%. The next busiest regions were the Northwest and Far West at 41.7% and 40.4%, respectively. This increase in applications resulted in almost all ABA-accredited law schools seeing more applicants, except for six law schools that experienced a 1% to 9% drop in application and one with decrease of 50% or greater, according to LSAC figures.\nMeanwhile, all regions saw the number of applicants increase, with the biggest jumps coming from the Northwest, which had a 38.7% uptick, the Northeast with 30.3% and the Far West at 30.1%, according to the LSAC.",

    "text": "An electrician with a passion for preservation restored an ancient piece of home electronics, allowing a woman to hear her departed mother’s voice on Christmas. The old animated version of Frosty the Snowman can pull many people back to their childhood; doubly so for Linda Swartz, who had an old book with an electronic recording of her mother reading it to her when she was young. Corrosion had long since rendered the circuitry unusable, but Linda kept it around for sentiment. Years went by, and as all mothers do, hers passed away in 2020. Enter Lars Robins, an electrician who came by to fix something in Linda’s house. In the course of his work he came across the Frosty the Snowman book. “I was really shocked because I didn’t think it was going to work,” Swartz [ told WCIA news.](https://www.wcia.com/news/everyday-hero-family-hears-late-loved-ones-voices-again-thanks-to-an-electrician/) “For a second there it looked like it wasn’t going to, but it did. I couldn’t be happier. Robins says his passion for preserving old things began when he worked as a teacher before his job as an electrician. Teachers are constantly creating and watching their kids create sentimental things, and understand how much old books and toys can mean even to adults.
