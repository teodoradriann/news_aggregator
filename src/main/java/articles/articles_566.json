    "text": "Homemade peanut brittle recipe makes tasty peanut brittle in no time! This classic recipe uses a few pantry-staple ingredients to make peanut brittle in less than 30 minutes.\nThis peanut brittle recipe is a family-favorite. It’s my grandma’s recipe, and she always made batches of it around the holidays.\nThe recipe is really easy; it takes less than 30 minutes to make.\nIt’s also made with just a few pantry-staple ingredients. So the recipe is just as quick and easy as it is tasty!\nHow to make peanut brittle\nStep 1: Line an 18×13-inch pan (half sheet pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.\nStep 2: Gather and measure out the peanuts, butter, baking soda, and vanilla. Set aside.\nStep 3: Add sugar and water to a large saucepan. Stir until well-combined.\nStep 4: Mix in corn syrup until combined. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to boil.\nStep 5: Once it comes to a boil, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. The thermometer should not touch the bottom of the pan but should be submerged in the corn syrup mixture.\nStep 6: Cook, stirring regularly, until the temperature of the mixture reaches 235°F.\nStep 7: Stir in the peanuts.\nStep 8: Continue to constantly stir until the temperature of the mixture reaches 300°F. The mixture should be amber colored and should smell nutty.\nStep 9: As soon as it reaches 300°F, remove from heat and stir in the butter, baking soda, and vanilla. It will foam up quite a bit once the baking soda is added.\nStep 10: Carefully pour peanut brittle mixture out onto the prepared pan. Quickly and carefully spread the mixture out into an even layer in the pan.\nStep 11: Let the mixture cool completely. Break it into pieces, and enjoy!\nTips\n- The baking soda makes the brittle foam and helps to give the peanut brittle its light texture.\n- It’s crucial to use a candy thermometer. You’ll need the candy thermometer to watch the temperature so that you can add the peanuts at the right time and cook the mixture to the correct stage.\n- The peanut brittle mixture will be very hot and very sticky. Please be very careful not to get it on yourself as you pour it into the pan and spread it out.\nRecipe FAQs\nYou can! Store the peanut brittle in a freezer-safe container and freeze. It will keep for up to 3 months in the freezer.\nYes, you can use a different type of nut, like almonds or cashews.\nThe salt helps to balance out the sweetness of the brittle. Feel free to use lightly salted nuts, but I don’t recommend using unsalted nuts.\nStorage\nPeanut brittle should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. It will keep for several weeks, up to about 6 weeks, when properly stored.\nMore Christmas treat recipes!\nIf you’ve tried this homemade peanut brittle recipe, don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below.

    "text": "The turbulent trajectory of former Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) leader Nur Misuari’s pockmarked political career is a cautionary tale on how power tends to corrupt, while absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Sandiganbayan on May 24 convicted Misuari of graft over some P77 million worth of ghost projects when he headed the now-defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).\nThe Sandiganbayan Third Division chaired by Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang found the 85-year-old former rebel leader guilty of two counts of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. In 2017, the anti-graft court charged Misuari with three counts each of graft and of malversation for favoring two companies in the purchase of P115 million worth of nonexistent educational materials when he was ARMM governor in 2000 and 2001.\nThe anti-graft court found that the transaction, which foreshadowed the anomalous Pharmally deal over pandemic supplies, involved no bidding and the alleged falsification of documents to procure a “technology package” worth P31 million from MBJ Learning Tools and P46.2 million from CPR Publishing. Despite payments being made, no goods were delivered, resulting in “damage and prejudice to the government and the public interest.”\nArmed defiance\n The court said that the companies lacked business and income tax records, as well as a certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMisuari and former Department of Education officials Leovigilda Cinches, Pangalian Maniri, Sittie Aisa Usman, and Aladdin Usi face a prison term of six to eight years each and perpetual disqualification from holding public office in the ruling that Misuari’s lawyer said they would appeal.\nThe graft conviction is a tragic but seemingly predictable conclusion to what was once seen as a heroic push for greater autonomy for Muslim Mindanao by an idealistic leader whose default mode, however, was armed defiance. In the 1960s, Misuari helped establish the Mindanao Independence Movement which sought reforms from the government through the MNLF. Failing to gain such concessions, he engaged in military conflict against the Marcos administration from 1972 to 1976. He later justified this as an armed response to the nonimplementation of the Tripoli Agreement originally signed by then President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and later included in the peace agreement signed by former president Fidel Ramos. The agreement established the ARMM, where Misuari became governor in 1996.\nSiege on Zamboanga City\nADVERTISEMENT But discontent over his mismanagement caused the MNLF to unravel, with supporters rallying behind new leaders. In November 2001, a faction of the MNLF loyal to Misuari attacked a Philippine Army headquarters in Jolo, Sulu, as a distraction to the ARMM elections scheduled later that month, which eventually replaced Misuari as governor. The hostilities caused hundreds of casualties, with the government filing rebellion charges against Misuari who then fled to Malaysia. Captured by the Royal Malaysia Police, he was extradited to the Philippines where he faced rebellion charges that were eventually dropped.\nIn 2013, angered by the Aquino administration’s planned peace deal with the rival Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the possible sidelining of the MNLF, forces supportive of Misuari laid siege on Zamboanga City resulting in the loss of at least 200 lives. With an arrest warrant for rebellion and crimes against humanity hanging over him, Misuari went into hiding.\nADVERTISEMENT In 2016, former president Rodrigo Duterte ordered the concerned agencies to suspend Misuari’s arrest warrant, supposedly so that the renegade leader could join his “campaign for peace” in Mindanao.\nMachiavellian character\nDuterte’s move early in his term may have been meant to co-opt Misuari and enlist the political support of what the former Moro leader believed was his remaining sizeable force. But even Duterte blinked and refused to welcome Abu Sayyaf into the fold as Misuari had suggested, rightly pointing out that the terrorist group had killed too many innocent civilians.\nSuch attempt to legitimize the group known to be kidnap for ransom brigands has revealed the former MNLF leader’s Machiavellian character, while his recent graft conviction suggests that mercenary motives have weakened his once robust claim to the leadership of a perennially marginalized group.\n ",
