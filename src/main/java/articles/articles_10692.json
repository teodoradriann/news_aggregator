    "title": "Cowboys’ Jerry Jones Admits Stirring Up Controversy, Demands Credit From NFL Media in Response to Ceedee Lamb Criticism - EssentiallySports",
    "text": "Jerry Jones [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/jerry-jones/] is a PR genius! Amidst speculations about Dak Prescott [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/dak-prescott/] and CeeDee Lamb’s contract extension, the Dallas Cowboys [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nfl/dallas-cowboys/] owner finally got frustrated and broke the silence. However, if you think that Jerry Jones is succumbing to the outside pressure, think again. We might have been falling for his tricks all along. The billionaire owner of the team recently did a presser and finally spoke his mind. In fact, he thinks that the media doesn’t give him enough credit for keeping the Dallas Cowboys relevant, even after years of successful campaigning and the Cowboys being the richest team in any sport’s history. Jon Machota of The Athletic made sure to bring Jones’ comments to the light of day. “I’m just gonna say this to y’all, give me some credit, OK? You don’t think I’m good with numbers? You think I know how to add and subtract? Do I know how to talk? And sell? I realize all the criticism and I understand it. As a matter of fact, I try to stir it up. And I have since I got here. That’s good. Be relevant. It works,” said Machota’s post, highlighting Jerry Jones’ comments to the media. If relevancy is what Jerry Jones is looking for in this case, he’s got it. Prescott and Lamb’s contract situation has been up in the air for a while now. For months on end, there have been talks about Dak Prescott’s potential contract extension. It’s a common pattern now. Jones says something hopeful and poof! There’s nothing after that. Speaking about addition and subtraction, it’s imperative to take a look at the Cowboys cap situation right now. The Dallas team incurred $6.04 million in dead cap money after they traded Ezekiel Elliott to the New England Patriots in the 2023 season. The running back signed a 6-year $90 million deal with the Dallas Cowboys (2019-2026), per Spotrac. But before the contract even expired, Ezekiel got released from the Cowboys and signed a 1-year deal with the Pats. While we’re on the topic of dead cap and salvaging money, you should know that the Cowboys parted ways with 5 of their regular starters. RB Tony Pollard (to Titans), LT Tyron Smith (to Jets), center Tyler Biadasz (to Commanders), DE Dorance Armstrong (Commanders) and DT Jonathan Hankins to the Seattle Seahawks. After all the releases and trades, the Cowboys still have $16.02 million in dead money in 2024. Obviously, it might have been done to save some money, but since Jones talked about crunching numbers, we can’t help but think about just one thing. DALLAS COWBOYS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAFT RACE The Dallas Cowboys’ spending have been abysmally low in the 2024 off season. That’s also one of the reasons why Jerry Jones is being criticized for, now. The Cowboys spend $13.7 million this off season on free agency signings. The astonishing thing about all this is that even the New Orleans Saints have spent more than the Cowboys this off season. The Saints spent $32.2 million in the off season! Per Spotrac, Prescott carries a cap hit of $55.1 million this year, while CeeDee Lamb carries a cap hit of $17.9 million this year. Now, if Prescott were to sign an extension this time, it’s slated to be around $55-$60 million in a year (average salary). On the other hand, CeeDee Lamb is no stranger to possessing an elite talent. Taking risky catches and making flashy plays comes at a premium and that premium will be around $35 million a year. In April, the Dallas Cowboys owner shared his thoughts about the cap situation that his team is in right now. He’s big on spending his money wisely and doesn’t want to regret his decisions later. If Prescott and Lamb were to get paid at the same time, the team will easily incur $400 million or more in dues over the coming five or six years. For Jones, it might even be 10 years before he recovers from a half a billion-dollar setback. “I think our structure and our involvement at every level that we are in our process of getting personnel is ideal for making good decisions. I know what it’s like to make a mistake because I’m going to be living with it 10 years from now. I’m not just in here for a five-year session at GM and then gone. I know what it’s like to have to live with how you’re doing that,” said Jones reflecting on his “all in” approach. Dak Prescott and Ceedee Lamb [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-10-01T212153Z_880451481_MT1USATODAY21548140_RTRMADP_3_NFL-NEW-ENGLAND-PATRIOTS-AT-DALLAS-COWBOYS.jpg]Oct 1, 2023; Arlington, Texas, USA; Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) celebrates with Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (88) after throwing a touchdown pass during the first quarter against the New England Patriots at AT&T Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports He further pointed out, “Sometimes you look at your account and you’re loaded with money in there that day, but you know you’ve incurred bills that have three times the bills that you have money in your account, but that day it looks like you got a lot of money. Well, you have to be disciplined about spending what’s in your account if you know you got all these bills.” While Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb are the talk of the town these days, there’s one man whose name doesn’t get associated with this situation too often. That man is the Cowboys HC Mike McCarthy, who’s also in his last year with the Cowboys. But the billionaire Jones thinks McCarthy is “qualified” to continue to keep being the Dallas HC. Just a few hours ago, Jones made a statement about McCarthy saying, “Mike has shown me that he’s qualified and he is excellent,” and “He’s shown me that he can be our coach for years to come. And he sits next to me in the draft, and I call on him a lot. And if you can’t get along with Mike McCarthy, you can’t get along.” As the Cowboys flew to Oxnard to start their training camp, CeeDee Lamb didn’t board the flight. The cost of missing training is about $40k each day but Lamb might be able to afford that or get the fines rescinded since he’s on a rookie contract. However, he was seen working out in Houston. Per Jane Slater, Lamb looks bigger, faster and more explosive. About his contract situation, the receiver addressed, “It just has to make sense.”",

    "title": "Hammers at the double in first Emirates victory since 2015",
    "text": "For the second time in two months Arsenal conceded a goal when the ball might already have gone out of play.\nAnd just as it had at Newcastle, where Mikel Arteta railed bitterly against VAR and all its deficiencies, it proved mighty costly for the Gunners. In terms of the match and, perhaps, their Premier League title hopes as well.\nGoals from Tomas Soucek and Tinos Mavropanos gave West Ham a first Emirates Stadium win since 2015 and propelled David Moyes' 'Champions of Europe' up to sixth.\nThe unexpected success also kept Liverpool at the Premier League summit, although Arsenal have one more chance to overtake before 2023 ends, by winning at Fulham on Sunday.\nArsenal hired a phalanx of lawyers to defend Arteta for crying 'disgrace' at the manner of Newcastle's 1-0 win on November 4. This time, though, they will just have to suck it up; both goals were also the result of sub-standard defending.\nYet spare a thought for VAR Craig Pawson and his assistant Ian Hussin. No doubt a hail of vitriol, virtual or actual, will come their way for deciding there was insufficient evidence for Soucek's 13th-minute Hammers opener to be wiped away.\nIt happened like this. Emerson pinged in a cross from the left that Arsenal centre-back Gabriel attempted to marshal away towards the opposite touchline.\nBut Oleksandr Zinchenko had also been alert to the danger - and his team-mate had no idea he was now right next to him. The ball pinged off the Ukrainian's chest and squirted across goal, destined to go out for a corner.\nJarrod Bowen, having failed to connect with the initial cross, had other ideas however and hooked it back for Soucek to drive high into the net from six yards and wait for VAR to confirm it was OK.\nIt took a long time for this to happen as the footage from the only relevant angle showed the ball disappearing from view behind Bowen's right leg as he made contact with his left. There was no sign of any gap so, just like Joe Willock's throw-in that never was in the build up to Newcastle's winner, the goal had to stand. Again by the barest of margins.\nFor a while, the setback knocked the stuffing out of Arsenal, who had swarmed around the West Ham goal from the moment James Ward-Prowse planted the game's first shot over theirs, with Bukayo Saka forcing Alphonse Areola into a save and Leandro Trossard firing over from Gabriel Martinelli's cutback.\nIt was Saka who got Arsenal back on track with a header that Areola did well to tip over. West Ham survived a nervous moment when Soucek slid in recklessly on Gabriel Jesus in the box - and again when Saka smacked a drive on to Areola's near post.\nThat was a real head-in-the-hands moment - and the half ended with the Hammers, who had lost Lucas Paqueta to injury and been allowed just 26% of possession, still in front thanks to their one and only shot on target.\nThe second period began as had the first, with Arsenal trying to pass their way through a wall of blue. Trossard was hurt in the act of firing over, clattered by Mohammed Kudus but no foul was given.\nDeclan Rice, booed by some of the away following, decided have a pop from distance but the former Hammers hero is a rare scorer and his effort was too high.\nAnd then, out of nowhere, West Ham scored again, through Mavropanos, the former Arsenal man, from a corner conceded by Ben White.\nAgain Gabriel was found wanting as the Greece centre-back out-jumped him to meet Ward-Prowse's delivery and power a header that went in off the underside of the crossbar and the inside of a post as well.\nMavropanos, back in English football after a four season spell in Germany with Nurnburg and Stuttgart, had played just eight games for Arsenal.\nArteta made a double change shortly after the hour mark, with forwards Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson sent on. Immediately Jesus met a Saka cross with a powerful header that Areola stopped on the line. The Brazilian was back soon after, to meet a White delivery to the back post, but this time his header went over.\nAreola did well to deny Trossard before Saka dived for a penalty that didn't fool VAR. It was West Ham's night, not theirs. And especially not Rice's as his clumsy challenge on Emerson resulted in a stoppage-time penalty.\nDavid Raya saved sub Said Benrahma's tame spot-kick but the final whistle followed straight after.\nRaya 7; White 6, Saliba 6, Gabriel 5, Zinchenko 5 (Nelson 64, 4); Odegaard 7, Rice 6, Trossard 7 (Smith-Rowe 79, 3); Saka 7, Jesus 5, Martinelli 5 (Nketiah 64, 4).\nAreola 8; Coufal 7, Mavropanos 8, Ogbonna 8, Emerson 8; Soucek 7, Alvarez 7; Kudus 6, Ward-Prowse 7, Paqueta 5 (Benrahma 33, 5); Bowen 7.\nMichael Oliver 6.",
