    "title": "Education expert: Achievement Test with abuses, copying and manipulation - Gazeta Express",
    "text": "A day before the Achievement Test in Kosovo's primary schools, education expert from the EdGuard Institute, Rinor Qehaja, raised serious concerns about the administration of the Achievement Test, comparing it to failures in the Matura Test. In an interview with Ekonomia Online, Qehaja said that the Achievement Test is riddled with abuse, copying, and manipulation that make the assessment invalid and unreliable. \"The Achievement Test in our assessment is not much different from the failure in administration of the Matura Test. On the contrary, we assess that it has escalated as evil in the form of abuses, copying and manipulation that occur by students, which is carried as a consequence that those good or not good students, in each case, present us with results that are not valid and reliable. What we advocate now, since the character of the test is orienting, is that we see it as necessary that the same one does not have weight in the registration for upper secondary schools, but remains in its pure purpose which is to orient students who are in those profiles, which are more suitable for them as skills and to serve as a good guide for a good career choice\", he said. Qehaja proposes that the test should not be weighted in high school enrollment, but should only be used as a guide for career orientation. \"The test structure and questions, no matter how updated, remain essentially the same, in form, organization, structure, and as such we do not expect any changes from previous years. We will have the same results, at a roughly similar level of pass rate, which is also subject to how rigorous the administrators have been during the testing. Generally, what is decisive for students is the number of points: the more points, the higher the probability of enrolling in the schools they want. For these reasons, more importance and proper administration of this test are needed, since at one point, a poorly administered test can very easily turn bad students into good test performers,\" said Qehaja. He asks the Ministry of Education and observers to guarantee fair administration and restore confidence in the process, avoiding damage to meritocracy and fair competition. \"This happens because of mismanagement. They alienate genuine competition and devalue the assessment of good grades that a student has had from lower secondary school. We call on the Ministry of Education to take it seriously and to convey it to observers in order to guarantee us a well-administered process so that it turns into a meritocracy and valid results that serve everyone,\" Qehaja told EO. Tomorrow (Friday), the Achievement Test for ninth-grade students will be held in primary schools in Kosovo, in a process that aims to measure the knowledge and skills acquired during compulsory education.",

    "title": "Opinion | Why Was It So Hard for Nikki Haley to Say \"Slavery\"? Civil War History Has the Answer - POLITICO",
    "text": "The presidential candidate’s recent (and swiftly qualified) comments about the Civil War helped spread a myth that has warped American history for over a century. In William Faulkner’s novel, Sartoris, someone asks the title character, Colonel John Sartoris, why he had fought for the Confederacy so many decades before. “Damned if I ever did know,” replied the aging veteran, now a pillar of his community in fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. Of course, we know why Colonel Sartoris raised arms against the United States. So does anyone with a high school diploma — assuming they used up-to-date textbooks. And so did Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, who in 1861 famously asserted that the “cornerstone” of the new Southern nation rested “upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.” All of which makes it disappointing, though not surprising, that at this late date — almost 160 years after the Civil War — Nikki Haley, a leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination, shares Colonel Sartoris’ selective amnesia on the topic. When asked a softball question this week about the causes of the Civil War, Haley, a former South Carolina governor, flubbed the answer , calling it a “difficult” question and mumbling on about “basically how government was going to run — the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.” This morning, Haley qualified the comment on a radio show called “The Pulse of New Hampshire,” and followed the clean-up job with a press release, stating: “Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government.” But as Haley must know — after all, as governor of South Carolina, she presided over the removal of Confederate flags from the Statehouse — many Americans do question the fundamental fact that slavery precipitated the Civil War, and her equivocation played into a long-standing agenda to rewrite American history. Haley was effectively parroting the Lost Cause mythology, a revisionist school of thought born in the war’s immediate aftermath, which whitewashed the Confederacy’s cornerstone interest in raising arms to preserve slavery. Instead, a generation of Lost Cause mythologists chalked the war up to a battle over political abstractions like states’ rights. With red states doing battle with American history , seeking to erase the legacy of violence and inequality that counterbalance the great good also inherent in our national story, it’s worth revisiting the rise of the Lost Cause, not just to remember how damaging it was, but to confront just how damaging it still is. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the work of interpreting the rebellion fell to a small group of unreconstructed rebels. The pioneers of Confederate revisionism included wealthy and influential veterans of the Confederacy like Jubal Early, B. T. Johnson, Fitz Lee and W. P. Johnson, who helped formulate the Lost Cause myth that would take hold by the 1880s. The narrative strains were simple. They painted a picture of Southern chivalry — mint juleps, magnolias and moonlight — that stood in sharp contrast with the North, a region marked by avarice, grinding capitalism and poverty. The rebellion, by this rendering, had been a legal response to the North’s assault on states’ rights — not a violent insurrection to preserve chattel slavery. Even Confederate veterans like Hunter McGuire knew that to admit the war had been about slavery would “hold us degraded rather than worthy of honor … our children, instead of revering their fathers will be secretly, if not openly, ashamed.” The myth gained steamed by the end of the century, largely because of the work of organizations like the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), groups that offered a compelling story that people could wrap their minds around — including many Northerners, who were eager to put the war behind them. Because the Lost Cause emphasized heroism and honor over slavery, it venerated military figures like Robert E. Lee and swept politicians like Jefferson Davis under the rug. So it was that in May 1890 over 100,000 citizens gathered in Richmond for the dedication of a statue of Lee. The decade saw hundreds of towns across the former Confederacy raise similar monuments to their heroes and war dead. These marble and steel memorials were often planted in town squares and by county courthouses to help sanitize not only Confederate memory but the new Jim Crow order. After all, if secession had been a noble thing, so was the separation of the races. The signs of revisionism ranged from subtle to clear. During the war, for instance, Confederate soldiers had keenly embraced the term “reb,” but the new gatekeepers of Southern memory abandoned the term. “Was your father a Rebel and a Traitor?” asked a typical leaflet. “Did he fight in the service of the Confederacy for the purpose of defeating the Union, or was he a Patriot, fighting for the liberties granted him under the Constitution, in defense of his native land, and for a cause he knew to be right?” Equally important was figuring out what to even call the war. It couldn’t be the “Civil War,” which sounded too revolutionary. It couldn’t be “the War of Rebellion” which smacked of treason. In the late 1880s, the UCV and UDC approved resolutions designating the conflict that killed 750,000 Americans the “War Between the States.” The term stuck for generations to come. It wasn’t just Southerners who suffered willful memory loss in these years. Jaded by the experience of Reconstruction and in the thrall of rising scientific racism, many Northerners were equally eager to remember the war as a brothers’ quarrel over politics rather than a struggle over slavery and Black rights. The jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who began the war as a committed abolitionist, later erased the roots of the conflict and celebrated the battlefield valor of both Union and Confederate troops. “The faith is true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty,” he said, “in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has little notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use.” Of course, historians agree that most Union troops did know why they were fighting. So did Holmes. But years after the fact, he was willing to forget. As were tens of thousands of veterans who attended Blue and Gray reunions well into the 20th century, including a massive camp gathering of 25,000 people who gathered at Crawfish Springs, Georgia, in 1889, near the Chickamauga Battlefield, for a picnic and public speeches. These mass spectacles helped Yankees and Confederates rewrite the history of the 1850s and 1860s, ostensibly in the service of national reunion and regeneration, but also in a way that fundamentally reinforced the emerging culture and politics of Jim Crow. The Lost Cause mythology was more than bad history. It provided the intellectual justification for Jim Crow — not just in the former Confederacy, but everywhere systemic racism denied Black citizens equal citizenship and economic rights. Its dismantling began only in the 1960s when historians inspired by the modern Civil Rights Movement revisited the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction, adopting the views of earlier Black scholars like W.E.B. DuBois and John Hope Franklin, who always knew what the war was about and had shined a spotlight on the agency of Black and white actors alike. That’s why the recent retreat to Lost Cause mythos is troubling. One would think that a Republican candidate for the presidency might be proud of the party’s roots as a firmly antislavery organization that dismantled the “Peculiar Institution” and fomented a critical constitutional revolution during Reconstruction — one that truly made the country more free. With GOP presidential candidates waffling on the Civil War, rejecting history curricula in their states and launching political fusillades against “woke” culture, it remains for the rest of us to reaffirm the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, who in the last years of his life stated: “Death has no power to change moral qualities. What was bad before the war, and during the war, has not been made good since the war. … Whatever else I may forget, I shall never forget the difference between those who fought for liberty and those who fought for slavery.”",

    "text": "精神疾病是世界上唯一可以用语言诊断和治疗的疾病。瞄准建立万例真实问诊场景下病人与医生对话的高质量数据集，天桥脑科学研究院正与上海市精神卫生中心共同推进一项名为“灵溪”的基础研究项目，目前项目进程已过半。\n名为《灵溪》的科普短视频。\n建设高质量数据集非常“烧钱”，天桥脑科学研究院已向“灵溪”投入超千万元，未来还将持续投入。研究院还与上海精卫中心共建人工智能与精神健康前沿实验室，希望找到用AI攻克精神疾病的钥匙。\n基础研究是推动科技发展与变革的原动力，是整个科学体系的源头和所有技术问题的总开关。作为一种“长线投资”，我国基础研究经费90%以上来自政府拨款。为探索多元投入机制，2021年，市科委与企业共同发起设立“探索者计划”，以共同出资的方式支持基础研究，如今，参与企业从2家扩容到12家，其中民营企业7家。\n响应政府引导的同时，一些企业开始自建资金池，真金白银投向需要10年、20年才能结果的基础研究领域。天桥脑科学研究院（中国）副院长杨扬透露，这两年不少民营企业来研究院取经，“同道中人越来越多了”。\n突破性成果背后的力量\n近半年，上海脑机接口领域进展频频。去年三季度，脑虎科技与华山医院神经外科团队合作完成了运动障碍患者用意念合成运动的脑机接口临床试验。今年初，脑虎科技宣布联合华山医院为一名受试者完成柔性脑机接口植入手术，在全球首次实现脑机接口的实时汉语解码。\n脑虎科技在全球首次实现脑机接口的实时汉语解码。\n两项突破性进展背后，都有天桥脑科学研究院的支持。研究院由盛大集团创始人 陈天桥 与妻子雒芊芊出资10亿美元创办，主要推动大脑探知、脑疾病治疗及脑功能开发三大领域的关键性研究。\n回忆公司的第一笔融资，脑虎科技创始人陶虎颇有感触：“当时谈了好几家风投，尽管投资人很有兴趣，但一听到商业化需要10年以上时间，都打了退堂鼓。”关键时刻，陈天桥在与他进行了一小时视频会议后，当场拍板投资脑虎科技3000万元。“他告诉我不用急，20年、30年都愿意等。如果失败了，就当作是支持科研的慈善投入。”陶虎说。如今，盛大集团仍是脑虎科技最大的机构股东。\n在复旦大学附属华山医院神经外科，设有研究院与华山医院合作共建的应用神经技术实验室，这是天桥脑科学研究院在全球布局的三大实验室之一。共建实验室如何运作？杨扬介绍，研究院出资聘任一线医生为项目负责人，研究双方共同感兴趣的课题，“我们还有一支全职AI、大数据专业团队，可随时加入相关课题组，共同推动项目前进。”\n企业创新渐入核心区\n据杨扬观察，目前社会创新主体呈现多元化特征。民间资本往往从市场实际需求出发，注重成果的应用转化，且在鼓励创新、宽容失败上更加“从容”，有望成为政府投入的有效补充。\n市科委基础研究处副处长费明钰注意到，有两类企业乐于投资基础研究：一是身处国际竞争较为激烈的行业、领域的企业，他们需要基础研究的突破带来新的增长曲线；二是新兴赛道中的创新企业，他们对科技创新有着天然偏好和旺盛需求。在她看来，越来越多社会资本愿意为基础研究掏钱，意味着企业日益进入创新核心区。\n鸿之微科技是一家从事多尺度仿真技术研究的企业，加入“探索者计划”以来，公司与市科委梳理出亟待解决的12个课题，面向全市科研单位寻找“解题”高手。鸿之微副总经理龚奎表示，公司的研发课题与数学、物理、材料、化学领域息息相关，比如要模拟复合材料中各种元素如何配比才能表现出某种性质，这需要从第一性原理出发模拟各类材料的特性进行求解。\n去年，国内“科学服务第一股”泰坦科技在沪设立自然科学发展基金会，探索以“充分信任+不论成败+科学监管”的公益模式，遴选资助基础研究项目，孵化科学问题。基金会注册资本300万元，第一轮运行计划为5年。\n这家从华东理工大学宿舍走出的大学生创业企业，已成长为市值数十亿元的上市公司。泰坦科技创始人、董事长谢应波表示，企业的成长离不开上海的创新土壤，鼓励更多科学领域的原创探索，也是为了反哺创新。\n从“投项目”到“投人”\n在市科委前沿与交叉技术处副处长、“脑机接口”项目经理人王卓曜看来，天桥脑科学研究院通过近10年的布局，织就了一张全球脑科学的合作网络。去年，由研究院牵线，全球脑机接口领域标志性学术会议创办25年后的亚洲“首站”选择了上海。\n天桥脑科学研究院不仅资助研究，还热衷与科学家对话，作为创始人的陈天桥已“面谈”了不下300位脑科学领域科学家。去年，研究院上线了“特殊病例国际学术社区”，寻找医生手中的特殊病例。对通过专家委员会评审的特殊病例，将给予科研经费支持。\n上海泰坦自然科学发展基金会的立项机制也从“同行评议”改成了“圆桌面谈”。泰坦科技副总裁马琳杰说，由基金会代表、资深科学家等组成科学评审委员会，通过多轮圆桌面谈，深入考察研究人员是不是真正对科研有热情，能不能沉下心来开展具有挑战性的研究，是否有强烈的意愿勇闯基础科学和前沿技术“无人区”。一旦定下人选，基金会则会给予充分信任，不以成果论成败，让科学家心无旁骛潜心探索。\n基础研究不确定性较大且回报周期长，如何引导更多企业“敢投”？2022年，国家财政部、税务总局出台了企业投入基础研究相关税收优惠政策。此前，上海已有多家企业享受了税收加计扣除。市科委透露，今年将进一步健全基础研究多元投入机制，研究制定鼓励企业加大基础研究投入、公众捐赠基础研究等支持政策，引导企业、个人成立基础研究基金会，激发更多社会力量共同浇灌“从0到1”的创新。",

    "title": "'It is historic': US poised to see record drop in yearly homicides despite public concern over crime",
    "text": "The year is expected to end with over 2,000 fewer murders than in 2022.\nWith 2023 ticking down, the nation is poised to finish the year with its biggest annual drop in homicides on record, according to preliminary data from law enforcement agencies both large and small.\nThe homicide rate in the United States is expected to plummet nearly 13% compared to 2022, meaning more than 2,000 fewer people were the victims of homicide this year, Jeff Asher, a national crime analyst, told ABC News.\nThe drop in homicides comes as more than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Adding to that perception is the annual National Crime Victimization Survey published this month by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics that found the number of violent crime victims nationwide climbed from 16.5 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022.\nCities say the 2023 drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols.\n\"It is historic. It's the largest one-year decline,\" said Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former crime analyst for the CIA and the New Orleans Police Department. \"It's cities of every size, it's the suburbs, it's rural counties, tiny cities, it's large cities. It's really a national decline.\"\nAsher said his analysis is based on available preliminary crime data provided by 180 law enforcement agencies.\nHe said before this year, the largest year-over-year drop in homicides occurred in 1996 when murders fell by 9%.\nAn ABC News review of preliminary crime data from the 10 largest U.S. cities shows that heading into the last week of the year, seven of the municipalities have seen double-digit year-over-year declines in 2023 homicides -- including an 11% drop in New York City, a 16% decrease in Los Angeles, and a 13% reduction in Chicago.\nHouston, the country's fourth largest city, saw its homicide numbers fall by 11% and homicides in Philadelphia, the nation's sixth biggest city, have fallen by 21%, according to the preliminary data.\nThe challenge faced by local law enforcement to bring down the country's homicide numbers for the second consecutive year following a record jump in 2020 and a sizable increase in 2021, was achieved this year with a major assist from the U.S. Justice Department and bipartisan gun-control legislation passed by Congress, officials said.\n\"We're seeing double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America's largest cities,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in an exclusive interview with ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, citing information from the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\nMonaco said the federal government has played the role of \"force multiplier\" in helping local law enforcement drive down the nation's murder rate by identifying and removing the most prolific shooters and violent offenders from the streets.\n\"Something that we are doing is using new authorities from the most significant gun safety law that has passed in 30 years ... the bipartisan Safer Communities Act that passed last year. And with that tool, we've charged more than 300 defendants with new gun trafficking and illegal trafficking,\" Monaco told ABC News. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with.\"\nSmaller cities are also seeing dramatic decreases in homicides. New Orleans, which had the highest murder rate in the nation in 2022, has seen a 25% drop in homicides in 2023. Baltimore's homicide numbers have fallen by 25%, Atlanta's by 18%, and Miami's by 15%.\nBut not all cities have seen homicides fall. As of Dec. 26, Washington, D.C., has seen its homicides jump 36% and Dallas has seen a 14% increase. In Memphis, Tennessee, homicides rose 31% through the first six months of the year, the most recent data available.\n\"But those cities are especially notable because they are outliers this year, not the norm,\" Asher said.\nOne of the largest drops in homicides occurred in Detroit, which as of Dec. 26 has seen murders fall by 18% since last year, according to the police department's preliminary data.\n\"We're looking at some numbers that we haven't seen in close to 60 years in the city of Detroit,\" Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News. \"But we're stopping short of celebrating because certainly we still have a lot of work to do.\"\nFollowing a rash of shootings in downtown Detroit in April, White immediately instituted a 12-point crimefighting program normally reserved for the hot summer months, he said.\n\"That involved just really having officers on foot patrol, bike patrol, engaging our community in a very positive way,\" said White.\nHe said the city, led by Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, has helped pave the way for an overall reduction in crime by boosting the number of police officers from 2,331 in 2022 to 2,486 in 2023 and giving cops a substantial pay raise. White said his department has been approved to hire another 200 officers in the coming year.\nLike other chiefs interviewed by ABC News, White attributed a large part of Detroit's crime turnaround to winning back the public's trust following widespread protests and calls for defunding police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. White said the city forged relationships with \"community violence interrupters,\" civilians who work in the streets to help the police department pinpoint problem areas and solve crimes.\n\"They're sick and tired of the senseless, violent crime and they're cooperating. They're telling us where the problems are, and it's our responsibility to address them quickly and keep working to keep those relationships strong in the community,\" White said about community violence interrupters.\nThe result, he said, has been 55 fewer homicides in the city compared to this time last year.\n\"That's 55 lives, 55 people, 55 mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters that don't have to bury a loved one,\" White said.\nWhite also noted that there have been 135 fewer non-fatal shootings in Detroit compared to last year.\n\"So if half of those had resulted in homicide, you can clearly see what the numbers would be, and the victimization that would have occurred, the families that would be impacted. But the fact that 135 people weren't shot this year is absolutely incredible,\" White said.\nBesides the tumbling homicide numbers nationwide, Asher said preliminary data shows significant decreases in nearly every type of violent and property crime, except for auto theft which has risen 10%. Through the first three quarters of the year, he said aggravated assaults were down 7%, robbery declined 9% and the number of rapes fell 15%.\n\"It's something that I think ideally deserves more attention. We certainly pay attention when things go up,\" Asher said. \"I think that we should be talking about it and writing about it, and discussing it when it goes down as well because there are important things to learn there, and we should be acknowledging what's happening.\"\nDespite the reductions in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide, recent polls indicate the majority of Americans believe overall crime is out of control.\n\"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong,\" Asher said, citing the Gallup poll last month.\nAsher's analysis appears to correspond with a report released last week by the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank comprised of policy leaders in the criminal justice field. The CCJ analyzed preliminary crime data from 30 large U.S. cities and found that homicides in the first half of the year fell 9.4%.\n\"If this trend continues through the end of 2023, the nation will have experienced one of the largest single-year homicide reductions in the era of modern record-keeping,\" the CCJ said in a statement.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, also reports a significant 9% drop in gun homicides this year. As of Dec. 26, 18,513 people had been victims of homicide, about 1,700 fewer than in 2022, according to the website.\nThe sizable fall in homicides comes after a record high in murders was set in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when courts were mostly closed and jail populations were being drastically reduced in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"Certainly, after it hit, we saw backlogs of cases and delayed trials and things like that,\" White said. \"There was no real accountability for bad acts.\"\nAccording to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which analyzed data from 15,897 law enforcement agencies, the largest single-year jump in murders in more than a century occurred between 2019 and 2020 as murders and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses nationwide rose nearly 30%.\nHomicides across the country continued to increase in 2021 by 4.3% before falling by 6% in 2022, according to the FBI report.\nSan Antonio, Texas, the nation's seventh biggest city, has experienced a nearly 12% decline in homicides this year, after seeing murders rise by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus told ABC News that the 231 homicides that occurred in his city in 2022, included the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of an abandoned tractor-trailer as part of a human smuggling operation.\n\"If you're looking at including those numbers, we're looking at about a 32% decrease. But if you extract those numbers, we're looking at a 12% decrease year-to-date,\" McManus said. \"But we're not complaining about 12% though.\"\nOne of the multiple crimefighting strategies McManus attributed to his city's falling homicide numbers was first suggested by a team of criminologists at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Actually, it was a very simple strategy that, quite frankly, I was somewhat skeptical of at first,\" McManus said.\nHe said by examining calls to the city's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD), the police department identified 28 areas of the city with the highest numbers of violent crime calls and even pinpointed certain days and times when the volume of calls is the highest.\n\"We will sit there at that location with our emergency lights on for 10 to 15 minutes. That's about as proactive as it gets,\" McManus said. \"We're not getting out stopping people or knocking on doors or anything like that. It's simply a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\"\nMcManus said that in the coming year, he plans to try other crimefighting strategies involving the city's public works department and animal control services.\n\"Specifically, to mention Animal Care Services, if you have a bunch of dogs running around, it brings the quality of life in that neighborhood down,\" McManus said. \"If you have a bunch of abandoned properties that are not being tended to, it brings the quality of life of that neighborhood down. Those properties could be used for drug sales, drug use, prostitution, all those things that make a neighborhood feel unsafe.\"\nAnother strategy is to \"address specific actors that are involved in violent crime,\" he said.\n\"We pull them in, most of them are under supervision, and we offer them services, we offer them possible employment. If you choose to accept that type of help, whatever it may be, then good for you,\" McManus said. \"But if you don't, then the next time you're arrested, we're going to throw the book at you.\"\nIn Phoenix, the nation's fifth largest city, interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan credited a 15% decline in homicides this year to a crimefighting strategy focused on clearing the streets of violent criminals in possession of guns.\n\"We know that if we focus on those areas, we're going to see reductions, and we did this year,\" Sullivan told ABC News.\nSullivan said his department launched \"Operation Summer Shield\" this year, which involved the help of federal and other local law enforcement agencies to round up people with warrants for their arrests. He said the operation resulted in the arrests of 580 people, with 70% wanted for felonies.\n\"I think we seized 40 guns from those prohibited possessors,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan said he has also used the strategy of putting detectives on the streets during the summer months to help increase patrols, saying, such a move has \"been very important in helping us control the homicide number this year.\"\nLike in Detroit, Sullivan said non-fatal shootings, which he described as \"truly failed homicides,\" are down 18% this year and attributes that to the launch of a \"Non-Fatal Shooting Investigation Squad\" that responds whenever a bullet pierces the skin to assist or assume the investigation.\nBut like other police chiefs in cities with falling homicide numbers, Sullivan said community engagement has been the most beneficial in the post-pandemic era.\n\"Community engagement is much easier when you're not doing it on a Zoom call, when you're having face-to-face meetings with the community and being able to build that trust,\" Sullivan said. \"When I talk about community engagement, you put a lot of deposits in the bank before people trust enough to be able to give us the information to close crimes.\"\nSullivan said his agency has also focused on recruiting the best officers for the job.\n\"What we would expect from our police departments is to have a good strategy. But then you have to have women and men who can go out and execute that strategy,\" Sullivan said. \"That's what we have here at the Phoenix Police Department, and I believe that's a recipe for success.\"",

    "title": "Ucrania intentó bombardear una planta nuclear: Vladimir Putin",
    "text": "Vladimir Putin en reunión con militares. El presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin, acusó el jueves a Ucrania de haber intentado bombardear la central nuclear de Kursk, situada a unos 50 km del frente abierto en territorio ruso por las tropas de Kiev. El mandatario no presentó ninguna prueba ni proporcionó detalles sobre el presunto ataque. El Organismo Internacional de la Energía Atómica (OIEA) había afirmado unas horas antes que su jefe visitaría la central la semana próxima, sin mencionar ningún intento de ataque contra las instalaciones. Moscú advierte desde hace varios días de la &quot;amenaza&quot; de una catástrofe nuclear en caso de ataque a la central por el ejército ucraniano, que el 6 de agosto lanzó una incursión militar terrestre sin precedentes en Rusia desde el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Kiev asegura que tomó decenas de localidades rusas. El enemigo trató de bombardear la central nuclear durante la noche&quot;, afirmó Putin en una reunión televisada con miembros de su gobierno y los gobernadores de las regiones fronterizas de Ucrania. Te recomendamos: &quot;La guerra ha llegado&quot;, dice Rusia a los primeros evacuados por ataques ucranianos. El gobernador de la región de Kursk, Alexei Smírnov, indicó a Putin que las instalaciones de la central estaban funcionando sin contratiempos. Ninguna autoridad ucraniana se pronunció hasta el momento sobre las acusaciones rusas. Máxima moderación Ucrania y Rusia se acusaron de amenazar la seguridad nuclear en reiteradas ocasiones desde el inicio del conflicto, desencadenado por la intervención militar rusa en la exrepública soviética hace dos años y medio. Las tropas rusas se apoderaron de la planta de energía abandonada de Chernóbil (en el norte de Ucrania) y de la planta de Zaporiyia (sur), la mayor de Europa, en los primeros días de su ofensiva militar a gran escala en febrero de 2022. La central de Zaporiyia sigue funcionando bajo control de Rusia, que afirma que las fuerzas ucranianas intentaron bombardearla en varias ocasiones con drones. A inicios de mes, se produjo un incendio en la torre de refrigeración de Zaporiyia, que según las autoridades rusas y el OIEA no tuvo ningún impacto significativo. El presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, acusa a Rusia de &quot;chantaje nuclear&quot;. Tras el inicio de la incursión ucraniana en Kursk, el OIEA pidió &quot;máxima moderación&quot; en la zona, &quot;para evitar un accidente nuclear que podría tener graves consecuencias radiológicas&quot;. La agencia de la ONU dijo que su director general, Rafael Grossi, visitará &quot;la semana próxima&quot; esa central. Un ataque aéreo ucraniano hundió el jueves un transbordador cargado de combustible en un puerto ruso frente a la anexada península de Crimea, informaron las autoridades regionales. Este puerto ruso está situado en el estrecho de Kerch, que separa Rusia de la península ucraniana de Crimea, anexada por Moscú en 2014. Fortalecer la defensa El sorpresivo ataque de Ucrania en territorio ruso dio un vuelco en el conflicto, infundiendo ánimo a sus tropas que desde hace meses resisten a duras penas el avance ruso en el este del país Zelenski visitó el jueves a su comandante en jefe en la región fronteriza de Sumy, desde donde Ucrania envía pertrechos y efectivos a las tropas que se adentraron en territorio ruso. Pese a todo, las tropas de Kiev todavía enfrentan duros reveses en la región oriental de Donetsk, donde Rusia afirmó el jueves que tomó otra aldea. Zelenski indicó que en Sumy discutió acerca de &quot;las medidas adoptadas para fortalecer la defensa hacia Toretsk y Pokrovsk&quot;, dos ciudades amenazadas por el avance ruso. En Rusia, Putin es criticado por minimizar en sus declaraciones públicas la gravedad de la incursión ucraniana. El gobernador Smírnov indicó que 133 mil personas huyeron o fueron evacuadas de distritos fronterizos desde que Ucrania lanzó el ataque. El jueves se estaban instalando refugios antiaéreos de hormigón en ciudades de la región, incluida Kurchátov, junto a la central nuclear de Kursk. Más de 110 escuelas rusas cercanas a la frontera impartirán clases a distancia cuando comience el año lectivo en septiembre, anunció el jueves el ministro de Educación. La ofensiva ha alejado aún más las mínimas esperanzas de una disposición por parte de ambos bandos a entablar negociaciones de paz.

Rusia descarta conversaciones directas mientras haya tropas ucranianas en su suelo y Zelenski rechaza dialogar con Putin y exige que Moscú retire completamente sus tropas de Ucrania, incluida Crimea y otros territorios ocupados desde 2014, y pague reparaciones por el conflicto. El primer ministro indio, Narendra Modi, visitará Ucrania el viernes, para tratar de reactivar las vías diplomáticas. Con información de AFP. ORP",
