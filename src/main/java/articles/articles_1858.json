    "title": "El 'piropo' de Ana Rosa a Pedro Sánchez: \"Guapo es, pero la que nos está liando\"",
    "text": "Las polémicas declaraciones del cantante Jorge González (Benidorm Fest 2024) sobre la supuesta discriminación a las personas que son 'guapas' fue uno de los temas que 'TardeAR' este jueves. El asunto fue analizado por los colaboradores del espacio en la primera mesa del programa, concluyéndose con un 'piropo' de [Ana Rosa Quintana](/tags/ana-rosa-quintana/) hacia [Pedro Sánchez](/tags/pedro-sanchez-2/). Este momento se originó en el momento en el que Frank Blanco le contestase en clave de humor a Susana Díaz, que aseguró que \"hay un estereotipo\" en la belleza a la hora de encontrar trabajo: \"El problema es cuando una persona busca un trabajo, que el exterior eclipsa la inteligencia interior\". \"Mira por ejemplo en España, la factura que le ha pasado a Pedro Sánchez el ser tan guapo\", comentó el colaborador. Solo instantes de las palabras de Blanco, Cristina Cifuentes también entró en el asunto para, en cierta manera, discrepar y pedir que no se le nombrase: \"Ni lo mentes. Guapo te parece a ti, a mí me da un poco de repelús\". \"A mí me gusta más Frank que Pedro Sánchez\", añadió la expresidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid. Ana Rosa Quintana sentenció este momento que se produjo en 'TardeAR', situándose en una línea similar al de Cifuente a la hora de opinar sobre la apariencia y el trabajo de Pedro Sánchez: \"Guapo es. Ahora, la que nos está liando, también\".",

    "text": "The privatization plan of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for the upcoming year has faced setbacks, as the privatization commission couldn’t resolve issues related to loan repayments and legal matters, a private TVchannel reported on Thursday, citing sources. Sources close to the development stated that the interim federal minister for privatization, Fawad Hussain Fawad, failed to implement the plan to transfer PIA to the private sector by January 2024. The Ministry of Finance will decide to meet the financial requirements of PIA for the next 3 months, while PIA has borrowed more than Rs. 270bn from commercial banks on government guarantee. Sources suggest that PIA cannot afford to pay more than Rs. 8bn in interest on the Rs. 260bn loan. The commercial banks involved in lending to PIA include the National Bank and Bank of Punjab, along with eight other commercial banks. The decision to reschedule government loans until the privatization of PIA could not be finalized. The Ministry of Finance will establish a committee to decide on the financial requirements of PIA. Earlier to this, the financial affairs of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) are likely to be handed over to the Privatisation Commission. Sources said that the PIA’s financial affairs will be handed over to the Privatisation Commission as the latter would take measures to reduce its losses. Sources further claimed that the commission will link the national carrier’s financial affairs with latest system. By improving PIA’s financial affairs, the commission will improve its balance sheet – which will help in the carrier’s privatisation. Meanwhile, sources added that the administrative control of the institution will continue to be with the PIA’s management. Moreover, the administrative affairs will remain under the Ministry of Aviation. Sources also claimed that the matters of PIA’s regulation will remain with civil aviation. The Privatisation Commission wants to make institution’s accounts transparent by December 31.",

    "text": "Tijuana, BC. Antonio Vera Palestina, quien cumpliera una sentencia de 25 años por el asesinato del periodista Héctor El Gato Félix Miranda, falleció este 28 de diciembre, dio a conocer Grupo Caliente donde laboró como jefe de seguridad. El ex alcalde Jorge Hank Rhon firma la esquela.\nVera Palestina quedó libre en mayo de 2015 y desde entonces se reincorporó al cuerpo de seguridad del Grupo Caliente, propiedad de Hank Rhon.\nEn abril de 1988 fue acusado de asesinar a Félix Miranda, co-fundador y columnista del Semanario Zeta, y desde entonces el medio de comunicación dirigido por Jesús Blancornelas lo señaló como autor material del homicidio.\nEse año lo apresaron junto con Victoriano Medina Moreno, quien también quedó en libertad en 2015, y siempre alegó inocencia de los cargos.\nA Antonio Vera Palestina también lo acusaron recientemente -en junio de 2022- de su presunta participación en la privación de la libertad y desaparición Oscar Gómez Islas, empleado de Grupo Caliente, pero negó los cargos y solo acudió a declarar ante el Ministerio Público.",

    "title": "L’Ukraine, impliquée dans le sabotage de Nord Stream? Un «non-sens absolu», selon Kiev | Le Devoir",
    "text": "La présidence ukrainienne a qualifié jeudi de « non-sens absolu » sa mise en cause dans le sabotage en septembre 2022 des gazoducs russes Nord Stream en mer Baltique, après des informations de presse en ce sens.\nLe Wall Street Journal a affirmé que l’ancien chef d’état-major ukrainien, Valery Zaloujny, avait supervisé le plan visant à faire sauter les pipelines qui alimentaient encore à ce moment-là l’Europe en gaz russe, malgré l’invasion par les troupes russes de l’Ukraine à partir du 24 février 2022.\n« L’implication de l’Ukraine dans les explosions de Nord Stream est un non-sens absolu. Ces actions n’avaient aucun intérêt pratique pour l’Ukraine », s’est défendu auprès de l’AFP le conseiller présidentiel Mykhailo Podoliak, en réaction à l’article du quotidien américain.\nSelon le Wall Street Journal , le président ukrainien, Volodymyr Zelensky , aurait été au courant du projet avant de faire volte-face et de demander son arrêt.\nLe porte-parole de la présidence a observé que l’implication de l’Ukraine dans le sabotage aurait « pu mettre un terme » à l’aide apportée à Kiev par les « partenaires européens ». Il a en revanche qualifié d’« évidentes » les motivations de Moscou dans la destruction des gazoducs.\nÀ lire aussi L’enquête sur le sabotage du gazoduc russe Nord Stream s’oriente vers l’Ukraine « La Russie a estimé qu’il était nécessaire de discréditer l’Ukraine de manière conjoncturelle, afin de réduire son influence diplomatique, émotionnelle et informationnelle sur la communauté européenne », a-t-il soutenu, quitte à « perdre les opportunités commerciales de Nord Stream ».\nLes affirmations du Wall Street Journal surviennent au lendemain de révélations dans la presse allemande selon lesquelles l’enquête judiciaire menée en Allemagne sur le sabotage s’orientait vers l’Ukraine , avec un mandat d’arrêt récemment lancé contre un plongeur professionnel de ce pays.\n« Comme une torpille » Six personnes au total ont été directement impliquées dans cette opération spectaculaire et inédite, selon le Wall Street Journal , pour un coût d’environ 300 000 $US, le tout financé par de l’argent privé.\n« Volodymyr Zelensky avait initialement approuvé le plan, selon un officier qui y participait et trois qui en avaient connaissance », a écrit le journal américain. « Mais après, quand la CIA en a eu vent et a demandé de l’empêcher, il a ordonné de le stopper », poursuit-il.\nValery Zaloujny, commandant en chef de l’armée ukrainienne à l’époque, aurait ignoré cet ordre et son équipe aurait modifié le plan initial, affirme le journal.\nContacté par le Wall Street Journal , M. Zaloujny, qui a depuis été nommé ambassadeur pour l’Ukraine à Londres, a déclaré dans un échange par écrit qu’il n’avait aucune connaissance d’une telle opération, et a qualifié de « provocation » toute affirmation du contraire.\nAprès avoir demandé de stopper l’opération, M. Zelensky aurait demandé des explications à M. Zaloujny, selon le journal, citant trois personnes ayant eu connaissance de cet échange.\nCe dernier lui a répondu qu’il était trop tard, affirmant qu’il n’était plus possible de communiquer avec l’équipe du sabotage, car tout contact aurait pu mettre en danger l’opération.\n« Il a été dit [à M. Zelensky], c’est comme une torpille, une fois que vous l’avez lancée sur l’ennemi, vous ne pouvez pas la récupérer, elle continue jusqu’à faire “boum” », décrit un haut gradé informé de cette conversation, cité par le Wall Street Journal .\nLes médias allemands qui ont révélé l’avancée récente de l’enquête judiciaire sont, eux, beaucoup plus prudents sur l’implication des hautes autorités ukrainiennes et tendent au contraire à disculper le président Zelensky au moins.\nL’hebdomadaire Der Spiegel évoque en revanche une possible implication de Valery Zaloujny.",

    "text": "Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: «Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.»\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert.",

    "text": "Sports\nTexas Receives Good News on Star Pass Rusher on Thursday\nTexas received great news on Thursday.\nAccording to ESPN's Pete Thamel, Trey Moore has decided to return to Texas for the 2025 college football season rather than declare for the NFL Draft. Moore was the last key player from the 2024 roster that seemed to be teetering between another year in college or moving on to the professional level.\nHaving Moore return to Austin is a massive win for Steve Sarkisian's staff as he recorded 10 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks and three forced fumbles this season. He is now expected to be one of the top pass rushers in the nation for the 2025 season.\nAlthough Texas is losing nearly two dozen players to the NFL Draft this offseason, the core of the Longhorns defense looks strong for 2025 with Colin Simmons, Anthony Hill, Trey Moore and Michael Taaffe returning to lead the unit.\nTexas will kick off the 2025 season in Columbus against Ohio State on Aug. 30.\nRelated: Tracker: Texas Players That Have Declared for NFL Draft After College Football Playoff Loss\nCopyright 2025 Athlon Sports.
