    "text": "Six people have been arrested and three garda cars were damaged at a protest at a site earmarked to accommodate international protection applicants in Newtownmountkennedy, Co Wicklow.\nMembers of the Garda Public Order Unit were also deployed to the site.\nGardaí have said that members of the force were on duty at the site this evening, when they came under attack by people gathered there.\nIn a statement, gardaí say that the incident developed \"as a result of workers, contracted to carry out lawful employment on the site, entering the site.\n\"A number of trespassers were also identified on and removed from the site,\" the statement said.\nThe statement said that uniform gardaí were \"subject of both verbal and physical abuse throughout the day, which escalated into rocks and other missiles being thrown this evening\".\nFires were lit at the scene, the statement said, and gardaí also recovered an axe.\n\"As the situation has intensified, members of An Garda Síochána used force to defend themselves as part of an escalated response to the situation,\" the statement said.\nGardaí have said that the Public Order Unit was deployed to the site and that pepper spray was used. Around 50 gardaí remain at the site this evening.\nThree garda cars were damaged during the incident, the statement said, \"including broken windows and slashed tyres\".\nGardaí have said that it was not aware of anyone being injured in the incident.\nIn the statement, An Garda Síochána said that it \"respects the right for citizens to exercise their constitutional rights; this right does not extend to breaches of Criminal Law, the interference with the rights of other citizens to carry out their daily activities, or to attack members of An Garda Síochána.\n\"Any Garda activity in relation to evolving events involves a graduated policing response taking into account relevant legislation and public safety, with enforcement as a last resort.\"\nVideos online appear to show material being burned at the entrance to the site known as Trudder House or River Lodge.\nEarlier, videos also appeared to show some scuffles between gardaí and protesters.\nThere have been ongoing protests in the area since construction work began last month on the former HSE site, which the Department of Integration said it was considering locating 20 eight-person tents for international protection applicants.\nEarlier this month, a small fire was lit on the site which gardaí confirmed they were investigating.\nLocals say they object to the site being used to accommodate asylum seekers, saying the site is unsuitable and that the resources of the village are already overstreched.\nAdditional reporting: Paul Reynolds",

    "title": "No, Taylor Swift did not endorse Kamala Harris in a photo",
    "text": "No, Taylor Swift did not endorse Kamala Harris in a photo\nBy Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN\n(CNN) — Taylor Swift’s supporters are keenly adept at reading into the singer’s lyrics and social media posts. And Swift is keenly masterful at providing what are known as “Easter eggs” for her fans, laying secret clues and hidden messages for her followers to dissect and discuss.\nThis week, a\nphoto shared by Swift that included a silhouette of a woman in a pantsuit — perhaps similar to one that could have been worn by Vice President Kamala Harris — had some fans suggesting the superstar had laid a massive Easter egg, giving her presidential endorsement to Harris.\nBut that’s not the case.\nThe\nimage in question, posted Wednesday on Swift’s Instagram in a carousel of ten images, shows Swift center stage performing in Warsaw, Poland. In the background of the image, a woman in a pantsuit is pictured waving as she walks off the stage. Some speculated the woman pictured was depicting a silhouette of Harris, but it’s actually one of Swift’s background singers, who wear pantsuits during the particular set that was pictured in Swift’s post. A closer look at Swift’s posts from other Eras Tour stops, shows the background performers pictured in clearer focus in the pantsuit costumes.\nAlso, the woman in the silhouette mistaken to be Harris is wearing boots, part of the performers’ costumes\nseen in other photos from the tour. (Though the vice president has been photographed wearing boots before, she typically wears pumps, or, more recently, sneakers with her suits.)\nFurther evidence of no endorsement? Swift’s caption did not reference anything evoking politics.\n“Oh I loved those Warsaw shows SO much!!! Our first time ever playing in Poland, but it won’t be the last,” Swift wrote with the carousel of photos. “I seriously had the best time 😆 Also want to thank those beautiful crowds for making us the first tour to play 3 nights in a row in your stadium!!”\nYet, some Harris supporters still thought they may have picked up on a clue.\n“Taylor Swift just low key endorsed Kamala Harris and MAGA is losing their minds,” the group Call to Activism\nwrote on X.\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Swift for comment.\nSwift posted the image hours before\norganizers canceled three of her concerts in Austria after authorities said they foiled a terror attack planned for the Vienna leg of her tour.\nSwift’s political past\nSupporters, political pundits, media figures and likely the Harris campaign itself is closely watching for Swift’s endorsement, wondering if — or when — it may come.\nOne of the most influential stars on the planet, Swift’s endorsement could have major impact with her hundreds of millions of fans around the world.\nIn fact, a community of “Swifties for Kamala” has already emerged, without the star’s participation, with thousands of Swift’s fans making signature friendship bracelets to support Harris and voicing their support of the vice president loudly across social media.\nSwift has yet to speak out about Harris or former President Donald Trump this election cycle, but she\nendorsed President Joe Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House in 2020.\n“The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included,”\nSwift told V magazine in October 2020 about her endorsement. “Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first. The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them.”\nOn\nsocial media at the time, Swift shared the cover of the magazine and joked, “So apt that it’s come out on the night of the VP debate. Gonna be watching and supporting @KamalaHarris by yelling at the tv a lot.”\nIn 2020, Swift\ntweeted about Trump, writing, “After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November.”\nSwift largely stayed away from politics for the first decade of her career. But in her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” she expressed regret for not speaking up sooner.\nIn a scene where her father told her that she could face backlash and media scrutiny for speaking out against Trump, Swift responded, “I don’t care if they write that.” She told her father, “I’m sad that I didn’t two years ago, but I can’t change that. I’m saying right now, that this is something I know is right … I need to be on the right side of history.”\nSpeculation about a 2024 endorsement from Swift has been going on for months.\nLeading up the Super Bowl, right-wing media and some Republicans suggested Swift was part of an alleged conspiracy staged by the NFL and Democratic Party to deliver the 2024 presidential election to Biden.\nTrump recently spoke about Swift, calling her “beautiful” but “liberal” in a new book about “The Apprentice.”\n“I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump,” the former president told author Ramin Setoodeh in his book,\n“Apprentice in Wonderland.”\n“I hear she’s very talented,” Trump said. “I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!”\nAfter the book was released, Swifties on the left of the political spectrum took to social media with a message for the former president: “\nStay away from her.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "No pinta un buen panorama para el Gran Telescopio Milimétrico (GTM), pues en el Proyecto de Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federación (PPEF), la institución que lo administra, el Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE), podría tener una reducción de 5.2% de su presupuesto; en 2024 se le asignaron 419.6 millones de pesos y para 2025 se consideran 397.9 millones de pesos. Este año se alertó que este telescopio —único en el mundo y que ayudó a capturar la primera fotografía de un agujero negro— se quedaría sin fondos. La entonces directora de Conahcyt, María Elena Álvarez-Buylla , se lavó las manos diciendo que para entonces ya habría otra persona en su cargo, mientras que el director del INAOE, Edmundo A. Gutiérrez , dijo que apelaría a pedir más presupuesto para 2025. Ante el anuncio de esta posible reducción, queda claro que el mantenimiento del GTM no fue considerado y se encamina a la deriva.

    "text": "Prince Harry recognised as Living Legend of Aviation for services to British Army The duke's appearance at the award ceremony in Beverly Hills comes on the same day he dropped a libel claim against Associated Newspapers Limited. Saturday 20 January 2024 08:57, UK Prince Harry has been presented with an award for his services to the British Army at a glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles. Just hours after the Duke of Sussex [withdrew his libel claim](https://news.sky.com/story/prince-harry-withdraws-libel-claim-against-mail-on-sunday-publisher-13051665) against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, he attended the Beverly Hilton Hotel where was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation for his work as a British Army veteran and pilot . The 39-year-old completed [two tours of Afghanistan](https://news.sky.com/story/prince-harry-there-was-an-unravelling-after-tour-of-afghanistan-12950628) as a forward air controller and an Apache helicopter pilot, having flown countless training missions in the UK, US and Australia. He served in the military for 10 years, rising to the rank of captain, and later founded the [Invictus Games](https://news.sky.com/topic/invictus-games-7093) - a sporting event for wounded military personnel and veterans. Hosted by actor and aviation ambassador John Travolta, the duke was inducted alongside US Navy pilot Fred George, former world speed record holder Steve Hinton, and [Jeff Bezos'](https://news.sky.com/topic/jeff-bezos-7701) fiancee, Lauren Sanchez. Similar to her husband - who has already been inducted - Sanchez received the Elling Halvorson Vertical Flight Hall of Fame Award for her skills as a helicopter pilot and aviation businesswoman. The Duchess of Sussex, who had been expected to attend the event, was not present as one of their children became unwell, the PA news agency understands. The duke was described as a \"humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate and environmentalist\" on the awards website. \"He has dedicated his life to advancing causes that he is passionate about and that bring about permanent change for people and places,\" a statement read. Earlier on Friday, Prince Harry dropped a libel claim against Associated Newspapers Limited over a February 2022 article about his legal challenge against the Home Office following a decision to change his publicly funded security arrangements when visiting the UK.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson said the duke's focus remains \"on the safety of his family\" and on his legal action against the Home Office.",

    "text": "圖、文／永續新聞網\n根據Atrius最新調查，55%的建築產業專業人士認為其組織在實踐永續目標方面「進展順利」。乍看之下，這似乎是值得慶賀的訊號——企業在永續浪潮中逐漸走上正軌，這比去年成長了8個百分點。\n▲企業雖積極擬定永續目標，卻因資料治理落後，無法真正轉化為營運效益。（圖／永續新聞網）\nAtrius在調查中提到了一個關鍵但經常被忽略的問題：「資料治理效率仍嚴重不足。」事實上，超過一半的組織仍仰賴手動帳單處理與人工抄表來蒐集永續資料，即使在智慧建築的浪潮中，數據早已充斥各個角落。\n這就是今天企業在ESG實踐上所面對的核心矛盾：想永續、也在永續，但方法還停留在過去。\n一場看似「前進」的永續戰略，其實正原地打轉\nAtrius的母公司Acuity Brands副總裁Lauren Scott一語道破盲點：「資料愈來愈多，卻讓永續決策變得更難。」當智慧建築端點爆炸性成長，來自感測器、能源管理系統（EMS）、智慧電錶等裝置的數據如潮水般湧入，但企業卻仍以傳統手法來整理、分析、甚至手動上傳報表。\n這樣的現象反映兩個關鍵結構性問題：\n組織內部缺乏跨部門整合：有46%組織仍採「部門分治」的資料管理架構，導致碳排資料無法即時整合、回饋管理決策。\n永續團隊人力資源過度緊縮：許多企業仍把ESG視為「報告責任」，而非「營運核心」，導致實際推動團隊過於精簡、缺乏科技資源支援。\n換言之，永續目標雖然明確，但通往目標的基礎建設卻遠遠落後。這就是目前全球ESG建築實踐面臨的「數據焦慮症」。\n從「合規導向」轉向「效益導向」的下一步\n值得注意的是，Atrius觀察到愈來愈多組織將永續行動的動機，從「政策合規」轉向「碳效益與成本效益並重」——這看似務實的轉向，其實也是一場心態革新。\n過去的ESG實踐，多半是為了回應政府監管或投資者壓力，但當聯邦政策延遲、政局搖擺不定時，企業逐漸意識到，若不將 ESG融入成本結構與營運優化，就永遠無法自發地驅動轉型。\n資料治理，正是這場轉型的關鍵。未來真正能在永續賽局中勝出的組織，不僅是那些擁有淨零承諾的公司，更是那些能將數據轉化為洞察、將洞察轉化為決策、將決策轉化為績效的公司。\nESG的第三張報表，會是「資料報表」\n當企業紛紛準備應對CSRD、IFRS永續揭露、SEC氣候資訊規則等報告準則時，也許該反思的不是KPI填寫得夠不夠快，而是：我們是否真的知道自己在排多少碳？能源消耗來自哪裡？建築系統何時最沒效率？\n答案，很可能還躲在成堆帳單後面的Excel表單裡。\n這場轉型，不能只靠報表，也不能只靠承諾。它需要的是：更好的資料、更快的整合、更深的洞察。\n否則，建築永續就只能永遠卡在「看似順利，實則停滯」的半路上。",

    "text": "LAMINE, LA NUEVA GRAN ESTRELLA DEL BARÇA\n¿El 'heredero' de Leo Messi? El Barcelona le daría la '10' a Lamine Yamal la próxima temporada\nPublicación:16/01/2025 - 21:49h\nActualización:16/01/2025 - 21:49h\nEl FC Barcelona continuará empoderando a Lamine Yamal. ¿Por qué? Todo parece indicar que le confiarán la gran responsabilidad de llevar la emblemática camiseta número 10\nPortar la camiseta número 10 de cualquier equipo de fútbol supone un reto mayúsculo para el futbolista que lo asume. Y es que, efectivamente, la '10' suele ser sinónimo de un jugador diferente, especial, técnicamente dotado y con la calidad suficiente para inclinar el compromiso a favor de su conjunto con tan solo un gesto técnico. Un elemento de esos que tienen 'aura'.\nEn el FC Barcelona, esto no es una excepción, ya que la camiseta número '10' ha sido llevada por varios de los mejores futbolistas en la historia de la institución, tales como Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Maradona, entre otros. Sin embargo, el más icónico de todos ellos ha sido Lionel Andrés Messi, seguramente el mejor jugador en la historia del club, con la mayor cantidad de compromisos afrontados (778), goles (672) y asistencias (303), siendo el protagonista indiscutible de varias gestas históricas para el equipo azulgrana.\nAhora, al llevar un jugador de tal calibre la camiseta número 10, la pregunta era inminentemente obvia: cuando Leo Messi decidiera retirarse o se marchara del club por cualquier otro motivo, ¿quién sería el encargado de portar tal elástica, con tanta historia en sus hombros? La fecha llegó y el argentino anunció su dolorosa salida del Barcelona en el año 2021, dejando esa elástica vacante y esa gran incógnita en el ambiente.\nAnsu Fati se presentó como un posible heredero para la '10' de Leo Messi\nEsta incógnita la resolvería el club, otorgando la '10' a Ansu Fati ese mismo año 2021. El de Bisáu emergió en el primer equipo con méritos y una irrupción estelar, convirtiéndose en un claro candidato para ser el digno heredero de esa magna responsabilidad.\nLamentablemente, debido a circunstancias del destino y una carrera marcada por la irregularidad y las lesiones,\nAnsu Fati no pudo cumplir con todas las expectativas puestas en él en el Barcelona. Esto sugiere que, a menos que haya un cambio en la situación del delantero, es solo cuestión de tiempo que deje vacante esa camiseta.\nLamine Yamal: ¿El nuevo '10' del Barcelona?\nDe quedar vacante esa camiseta, aparentemente ya hay un candidato a enfundársela ¡Y qué candidato! Según comentó el periodista Jota Jordi en el 'Chiringuito de Jugones', el inequívoco aspirante a llevar la ‘10’ del Barcelona de cara a la próxima temporada es Lamine Yamal: \"Lamine llevará la '10' en el Barça el año que viene\".\nLamine Yamal tiene grandes fundamentos para sostener su candidatura a ser el '10' del FC Barcelona. El delantero, que actualmente porta la camiseta '19', como lo hiciera Leo Messi en su momento antes de llevar la mítica '10', a sus escasos 17 años se ha convertido en\nla gran estrella joven del Barça y, ¿por qué no?, del fútbol mundial.\nEste asunto va más allá de las estadísticas, se trata también de lo que demuestra en el terreno de juego. Es aquel jugador que, al tomar la pelota, crea esa innegable sensación de que algo podría suceder. Posee una calidad, creatividad y capacidad de invención que pone con total descaro al servicio del combinado catalán y de la selección española, convirtiéndose en un dolor de cabeza para sus rivales.\nPudiera ser un auténtico golpe de mercado\nYa ha sido ampliamente elogiado y su incipiente leyenda comienza a crecer. Se ha convertido en una referencia a nivel mundial y, por supuesto, en el jugador al que los rivales observan detenidamente, elaborando planes específicos para limitar su impacto. Además, es un recurso al que sus compañeros recurren para desbloquear el partido con alguna jugada peligrosa.\nA su vez, es esa figura que reclama una afición que se había sentido desolada tras el adiós de Leo Messi y la desazón con Ansu Fati. Con Lamine, han recuperado la esperanza de tener a un 'crack' de talla mundial, un cariño que se refleja en los aplausos que recibe y, aún más, en las camisetas con su nombre,\nsiendo la más solicitada en las tiendas. ¿Se imaginan si finalmente asume la responsabilidad de llevar la camiseta ‘10’? Es algo para reflexionar...",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vosoritide’s first global phase 2 study showed an average increased growth rate of 1.8 cm per year in children with hypochondroplasia, a genetic cause of short stature in children, according to researchers from Children’s National Hospital.\n“This is the first medicine that has been developed to specifically target the pathway involved in hypochondroplasia,” says Andrew Dauber, M.D. , chief of Endocrinology at Children’s National. “These findings will help inform future studies of vosoritide for addressing growth disorders.”\nThis clinical trial funded by BioMarin is the first-of-its-kind to treat children with genetic short stature who do not have achondroplasia.\nThe team found the annualized growth velocity increased by 2.26 standard deviation (SD) and the height standard deviation score (SDS) increased by 0.36 SD during the treatment period versus the observation period. Hypochondroplasia specific height SDS increased by 0.38 SD, according to the trial published in eClinicalMedicine .\nThe authors studied 24 children with hypochondroplasia. Half were female and 22 out of 24 had the p.Asn540Lys variant in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The mean age was 5.86 years old, and the baseline height was between -4.78 SD to -2.27 SD. The trial consisted of a 6-month observation period to establish a baseline annualized growth velocity followed by a 12-month intervention period during which vosoritide was administered daily via subcutaneous injection at a dose of 15 micrograms/kg/day.\nThe researchers found the absolute annualized growth velocity increased from a mean of 5.12 +/- 1.36 cm/year during the observation period to 6.93 +/- 0.93 cm/year during the intervention period for a mean difference of 1.81 cm/year for children with this condition. During the trial, the researchers also noted there were no treatment-related serious adverse events and no one discontinued therapy.\nThe study findings also showed standing height SDS increased by 0.37 SD during the year of treatment or 0.41 SD using hypochondroplasia specific growth charts.\nOther growth-related conditions included in this phase 2 trial were Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello syndrome, NPR2 mutations and Aggrecan mutations. This manuscript includes only information specific to hypochondroplasia. Full data for all conditions studied in the trial will be available at a later date.\n“Patients have come from all over the world to be part of our trial,” Dr. Dauber says. “We’re excited to see how well tolerated the medication was and how some patients had excellent responses.”\nMedia contact: Beth Riggs | briggs@childrensnational.org\n###\nAbout Children’s National Hospital\nChildren’s National Hospital, based in Washington, D.C., was established in 1870 to help every child grow up stronger.Today, it is the No. 5 children’s hospital in the nation and ranked in all specialties evaluated by U.S. News & World Report.
