    "text": "Google has reportedly canceled the development of its highly anticipated Pixel Tablet 2. This move has sparked speculation about the company's future plans for the tablet category.According to a report by Android Authority, Google has decided to redirect its tablet team to focus on other projects, effectively shelving the Pixel Tablet 2. This isn't the first time Google has abandoned a tablet project; the company previously canceled the Pixel Tablet in 2019.The Pixel Tablet 2, initially slated for a 2025 release, was set to leverage Google's powerful Tensor G4 system-on-chip, the same processor powering the Pixel 9 series. In contrast, the Pixel Tablet 3, rumoured for a 2027 debut, is expected to feature the advanced Tensor G6 chip. Given this timeline, it seems unlikely that Google would have initiated development on the Pixel Tablet 3 while its predecessor, the Pixel Tablet 2, was still in its prototyping stages.While the reasons behind this decision remain unclear, it's possible that Google is facing challenges in competing with established players like Apple and Samsung in the tablet market. The company may also be prioritising other product categories, such as smartphones and laptops.Meanwhile, there are growing speculations about a potential merger between Chrome OS and Android. This strategic move could be Google's response to Apple's dominant iPad, aiming to enhance competitiveness in the tablet market. Such a merger could pave the way for exciting innovations in the future of Google's tablet offerings.",

    "text": "- The Nadco report contains solutions to issues that Kenyans, including Gen Zs, have raised, the governor said\n- The bipartisan team took views from Kenyans on the reforms they wanted implemented and compiled the Nadco report\nMajority of Homa Bay residents support ODM leader Raila Odinga's remarks on the National Dialogue Committee report, Governor Gladys Wanga has said.\nThe Nadco report contains solutions to issues that Kenyans, including Gen Zs, have raised, the governor said.\nThe Committee was formed after Azimio supporters engaged in street protests last year, to demand the cost of living be lowered.\nOther issues that were outlined are high taxation, rampant corruption and joblessness among the youth.\nAs the protests between March and July 2023 got bloody, President William Ruto and Raila agreed to dialogue, leading to the establishment of the Committee.\nThe bipartisan team took views from Kenyans on the reforms they wanted implemented and compiled the Nadco report.\nHowever, the recommendations are yet to be effected.\nOn Tuesday, Raila said the report contained many of the issues raised by the youth and implementing it fully would resolve these.\nHe called on Kenyans to give national dialogue a chance, saying this would enable them to come up with solutions.\nBut his remarks did not go down well with Gen Zs, who criticised him for supporting dialogue while they called for action.\nIt was in this regard that Wanga claimed residents supported Raila's stand.\n“I have no doubt that many Homa Bay people support Raila and the plan to have a national conversation. We’re sure that full implementation of the report will ensure Kenyans get the reforms they wanted,” the governor said.\nShe spoke during the launch of the Genowa Ondoa Kaunda classrooms initiative at Ndonyo primary in Karachuonyo constituency.\nThe initiative seeks to eradicate mabati structures in Early Year Education schools.\nWanga asked the youth to give dialogue a chance as proposed by the ODM leader, saying he understands the needs of youth and other citizens.\n“Raila has the best interest of Kenyans at heart,” she said.\nThe governor applauded Raila and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for attending the signing of the electoral agency amendment bill by the President at KICC.\n“We must understand that Kenya is at a crossroads and dialogue is what can help us get solution to our problems. And that is why the signing of the IEBC Amendment Bill was a big stride the country made last Tuesday,” Wanga said.\nThe new law paves the way for the appointment of new IEBC commissioners, which is one of the contentions raised by Gen Z protestors.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "Mayor Eric Adams is reversing nearly $170 million in proposed cuts to the already-bloated Department of Education — announcing Wednesday he’ll be expanding early childhood education programs citywide.\nThe $167 million, which had been left out of Adams’ preliminary budget plan for the 2026 fiscal year, will go toward expanding access to the city’s free preschool program for 3-year-olds, dubbed 3-K, and to universal pre-K special education.\n“To truly make New York City the best place to raise a family, we know we must invest in our children’s future, and today, we’re making bold investments in early childhood education — to ensure our youngest students have the tools they need to succeed, and so parents don’t have to choose between earning a paycheck and caring for their children,” Adams said.\n3 Mayor Eric Adams and former Mayor Bill De Blasio made an announcement about child care at DOE headquarters on Wednesday April 16th. William Farrington Hizzoner made the announcement alongside Schools Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos and former Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose signature platform was expanding universal pre-K and 3-K for working class families.\nSpeaking later to CNN’s Dana Bash, Adams said the funds would be part of an annual commitment.\n“We’re going to make it a permanent part of the government,” he said on “Inside Politics.”\nThe cash infusion comes after Adams said last week he’d be shelling out to hire 3,700 new teachers next year to meet the state’s new class size law mandate.\nHis preliminary budget, released in January, already allocated a whopping $41.2 billion for the DOE — a third of the entire city’s budget. Adams’ finalized budget plan is expected in June.\nBut City Council members had been calling on Adams to restore even more funding for early childhood programs — to the tune of another $30 million — in its own budget proposal this month.\n3 The cash infusion comes after Adams said last week he’d be shelling out to hire 3,700 new teachers next year to meet the state’s new class size law mandate. William Farrington “I’m glad the mayor is restoring the cuts that he made. If I take $100 from you, I don’t get to tell people I just gifted you with $100 because I’m just returning the $100,” Council Committee on Finance\nChair Justin Brannan said Wednesday.\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is also running for mayor, and Education Chair Rita Joseph also issued a joint statement with Brannan later Wednesday that poured cold water on Adams’ celebratory announcement.\n“Access to a strong early childhood education system is imperative for working- and middle-class families to remain in our city and raise their children here,” the statement said. “While it is positive that Mayor Adams is returning and baselining some of the money withheld from his budget that the Council fought for, he is still cutting tens of millions of dollars from our children.”\nThe tension underscores a long-standing clash between the Council and City Hall over Adams previously similarly announcing severe budget slashes, before eventually reversing the cuts.\nDe Blasio, speaking on CNN alongside Adams, noted that the funding announcement comes as President Trump’s administration takes aim at the state Education Department’s resources.\n3 The tension underscores a long-standing clash between the Council and City Hall over Adams previously similarly announcing severe budget slashes, before eventually reversing the cuts. William Farrington “What Mayor Adams is doing is even more important given the backdrop of what’s going on in Washington,” he told Bash.\nBut saving de Blasio’s sole legacy initiative wasn’t enough to snag Adams a re-election endorsement from his predecessor.\n“It’s early still in this election here in New York City,” de Blasio, sitting next to Adams, said when Bash asked who he’d be backing.\n— Additional reporting by Haley Brown and Craig McCarthy",

    "text": "LA Times New storm bringing more rain, dangerous surf to California as Ventura cleans up after massive waves Karen Garcia, Christian Martinez, Ashley Ahn, Nathan Solis December 29, 2023 at 5:25 PM · 5 min read 5 Link Copied Read full article Surfers navigate rocks and driftwood at Surfer's Point as they look for a spot to enter the water as large waves pound the beach on Thursday in Ventura. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\nA new rainstorm was expected to move into Southern California on Friday night as residents in some coastal communities dug out from big waves that damaged homes, closed beaches and left several people injured.\nHigh surf battered the California coast on Thursday, with Ventura County particularly hard hit. The conditions will ease Friday, but dangerous waves will return Saturday when Southern California beaches could see 6- to 12-foot waves, with more rain expected, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe next storm system expected to arrive in San Luis Obispo County by Friday afternoon, according to the forecast, and will make its way south along the coast, cooling temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees, according to the weather service. But in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, residents can expect an offshore flow from the east that brings a few degrees of warming temperatures on Friday.\nOvernight, the storm will arrive along the Central Coast with rain expected in Los Angeles County by late Saturday morning. The forecast calls for several hours of rain, including a few hours of intense showers, and cooler temperatures.\n\"We're expecting significant rainfall for two to three hours on Saturday,\" said meteorologist David Sweet, of the National Weather Service in Oxnard. \"It's not going to be as strong as the storm system we saw last week, for a few hours it will cause some nuisance flooding. Drivers should be aware of puddling in roadways and give themselves more time or slow down.\"\nForecasts show a slight chance of rain on New Year's Eve in the Pasadena area and lingering through New Year's Day. The forecast shows a 20% to 30% chance for light rain.\nThe National Weather Service is also tracking a second system of strong waves that are expected to arrive by Saturday, with 15- to 20-foot waves, including sets of up to 25-foot waves, along the Central Coast. Ventura County beaches are expected to receive 10- to 15-foot waves, with 20-foot sets. Santa Barbara County beaches along the South Coast will be hit with 7- to 12-foot waves and in some areas 15- to 20- foot sets along west-facing beaches near Point Conception, according to forecasts.\nHigh surf warnings will be in effect through Saturday night for the region. Along with the high surf advisory for Los Angeles-area beaches, the weather service issued a coastal flood advisory through 10 p.m. Saturday.\nWhile the high surf is expected to die down by Sunday, officials advise people to stay out of the water and away from beaches over the weekend because of coastal erosion, flooding and strong rip tides.\n\"Take caution and heed the direction of local authorities and lifeguards,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Never ever turn your back to the water as damaging and life-threatening sneaker waves are likely to occur.\"\nOn the Ventura County coast, residents were assessing the damage.\nRead more: Huge waves damage homes, cause injuries along California coast\nEight people sustained minor to moderate injuries and were taken to the hospital after large waves caused flooding near South Seaward Avenue at approximately 10:50 a.m. Thursday, Ventura County Fire Department Captain Brian McGrath said.\nOf the injured, some were located in Inn on the Beach, a boutique hotel located along the coast and now closed because of flooding, he said.\nThe county fire department also rescued at least 15 people out of the ocean Thursday morning during high tide, McGrath added. None sustained injuries, he said.\nDramatic videos emerged of one wave smashing onto the Ventura coast and water inundating streets, forcing people to run for their lives. One video showed waves knocking down some bystanders. Another shows waves racing down several blocks as people tried to get away.\nAt around 10:45 a.m., a rogue wave slammed Inn on the Beach, flooding rooms with nearly 2 feet of water.\nThe force of the wave smashed glass on the patios of rooms facing the ocean.\nThe wall of water tossed furniture all about. Desks and beds and dressers stood at odd angles inside rooms, covered in mud.\nLuckily no guests were injured, although some were stuck in their rooms for a short time, officials said.\nAround 45 guests were evacuated from the hotel, which will have to close for an unknown amount of time.\nThe floor of the lobby was covered in mud and sand, said Jay Williams, the hotel manager.\nOne wave dragged a man a short distance down the street, while some people became trapped in the water near their cars.\nNorthern California beaches were also hard hit.\nIn Santa Cruz County, the Rio del Mar Esplanade was flooded with several inches of stormwater.\nJust north of the town Half Moon Bay, on the coast between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, the surf break known as Mavericks hosts some of the largest waves in the U.S. and attracts big-wave surfers from around the world.\nMore than a dozen surfers were spotted catching the waves at Mavericks on Thursday morning, with thousands of spectators gathered at the cliffs to watch, said Tina Lourenco, who works at Old Princeton Landing — a popular restaurant and bar for locals and surfers in Half Moon Bay.\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.
