    "text": "The 10 Most Incredible Videos of 2023! Extreme Weather and Natural Phenomena At Meteored we have compiled the most impressive videos of 2023 that has left us a large repertoire of extreme meteorology and shocking natural phenomena. Sand storms, flash floods, cloud formations, giant waves... What will be our number 1? The top 10 article with the most impactful videos of the year has become a Meteored classic. Our editorial team has already accumulated more than half a decade of daily, tireless searching for audiovisual testimonies, showing everything from the most extreme meteorological phenomena on the planet to small curiosities or natural disasters. In this edition we have a very impressive collection, with some atmospheric events that have turned out to be catastrophic in one way or another, reflecting the unstoppable advance of current climate change, or some natural phenomenon that will leave you with your mouth open because you will think that it is from some science fiction. With number 10 we have a great sandstorm that hit the city of Marrakech in August, turning the city's sky orange and with wind gusts of more than 80 km/h. The damage was very serious. For ninth position we move to Colombia, specifically to the beaches of La Boquilla, in the north of Cartagena. A woman died instantly after receiving a direct hit from lightning while she was enjoying a walk. In position eight we jump to [Europe](https://www.theweather.com/europe.htm), specifically to Bardonecchia, in the Piedmontese Alps (Italy). In mid-August a large storm caused a spectacular and large flash flood in the ravines in the area. We jumped over the pond to go to Guatemala, where a few days later an impressive lightning bolt that \"came out\" from the imposing Agua volcano was captured at the right moment. Without a doubt, it deserves seventh place! We continue climbing to reach sixth position. A few weeks ago the Iskitimka River, in southern Russia, was dyed a very intense red due to the discharge of an unidentified pollutant. In fifth place we traveled to the Colombian municipality of Villa Caro, with a shocking landslide after an episode of heavy rains. Fourth place goes to an impressive stratocumulus volutus associated with a powerful gust front, which left intense winds in mid-October in northern Uruguay. The 3 best videos of 2023 We reached the podium, with a very close result. The bronze medal goes to the episode of hurricane-force winds that left several people injured in mid-November in the Küçükçekm district of [Istanbul](https://www.theweather.com/istanbul.htm). The second position goes to a terrifying shelf cloud that swept through Normandy (France) at the end of August, does it look like a Tornado Alley storm? The winner of the ranking is an impressive video recorded in Cape [Cornwall](https://www.theweather.com/south-west-england-county.htm), in the south-west of England, where the powerful storm Noa left winds of more than 150 km/h and these gigantic waves. He is the just victor! Let's hope 2024 brings us a kinder classification.",

    "text": "Boeing Workers Strike Over Rejected Contract: A Blow to the Aerospace Giant Thousands of Boeing aircraft assembly workers started a strike after rejecting a tentative contract. This action involves over 33,000 machinists, shutting down significant airplane production. Despite a proposed 25% pay increase over four years, workers demanded more substantial raises and reinstating traditional pensions. Boeing's struggles continue under CEO Kelly Ortberg. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 13-09-2024 15:22 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 15:22 IST - Country: - United States Early Friday, thousands of Boeing aircraft assembly workers initiated a strike at factories near Seattle and elsewhere after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative contract proposing a 25% wage increase over four years. With a 94.6% rejection and 96% approval of the strike, the labor action, involving 33,000 machinists mainly in Washington state, is expected to halt production of Boeing's top-selling airline planes. Although commercial flights are unaffected, this strike poses another setback for Boeing's already troubled reputation and finances. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who recently took the helm, faces the challenge of addressing workers' demands for a 40% pay rise over three years and the return of traditional pensions, amid the company's ongoing financial struggles and competition with European rival Airbus.

    "title": "Is this village near Mumbai an Islamic State 'liberated zone'? - Times of India",
    "text": "Barely 60 kilometres from Mumbai lie the villages of Borivali and Padgha. Surrounded by the slopes of Mahuli Hills, this quaint locality in Bhiwandi taluka in Thane district has for long earned notoriety for being an alleged terror hotbed. And a recent crackdown by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took it a notch higher.In the early hours of December 9, the NIA busted a ‘terror network’ in Borivali-Padgha. The federal counter-terror agency arrested 15 people for their alleged links with the proscribed Islamic State (also known as Isis).The crackdown was part of simultaneous operations conducted in 44 locations across Maharashtra and neighbouring Karnataka.“NIA investigations have revealed that the accused, all members of Isis Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali, where they had hatched a conspiracy to spread terror and violence across India,” the agency said in a statement.“The arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone’. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence for strengthening the Padgha base,” the statement read.But this is not the first time that the village has seen such a crackdown. Almost two decades ago, some of its residents were accused of indulging in terrorist acts as well. medium106348945A blast from the pastFive residents of the Muslim-dominated village were convicted in the 2002-03 Mumbai serial blasts case. The key accused, Saquib Nachan, is one of the 15 people arrested during the December 9 raids. He has been named as the kingpin and head of the Islamic State module in Maharashtra. In August this year, Saquib’s son Shamil was arrested in connection with the Isis sleeper cell that was busted by the police in Pune.Saquib has been booked in over a dozen terror cases and convicted twice. In 1997, he was convicted by the Supreme Court for planning terror attacks in India, along with Khalistani terrorists. He was convicted again in 2016 by a Mumbai court under the Arms Act. He served both the sentences and was released in 2017. medium106349118A ‘liberated zone’ The Islamic State and its various offshoots are banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, or the UAPA. According to the US’ Director of National Intelligence, Islamic State is a Salafi-jihadist group that has conducted and inspired terrorist attacks worldwide, resulting in thousands killed or injured.Voice of Hind, a propaganda magazine suspected to be published by the Islamic State a few years ago, appealed to Indian Muslims to “wake up” and fight against the alleged oppression and atrocities meted out to the community.In its statement, the NIA claimed to have recovered a pistol, two air-guns, eight swords or knives, more than ₹68 lakh in cash, 51 Hamas flags, incriminating documents, smartphones and other digital devices, during the raids on December 9.The agency also said that the arrested men, who are in police custody, had self-declared the village of Padgha as a ‘liberated zone’ and as ‘Al Sham’ (an Arabic word used for Levant or greater Syria). They had allegedly motivated impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha for strengthening the Islamic State's base.The prime accused in the Padgha case, Saquib Nachan, used to administer a 'bayath' (oath of allegiance to the Khalifa of Islamic State) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation, the NIA claimed.Locals, however, deny any such attempts to declare Padgha as a “liberated territory” or asking Muslims to relocate to the area. “Most of the people in the village have been here for generations. We all know each other, people who have relocated are the ones who have found work in the nearby warehouses,” a local says speaking on condition of anonymity.He stresses that the Padgha gram panchayat and all other government offices in the area still retain their names, “Where is the question of declaring the village as ‘Al-Sham’?” he asked. 106351657Other side of the storyVillagers tell TOI+ that police and NIA are telling just one side of the story. They say Padgha finds mention in India’s history for its contribution to the freedom struggle. Village women had then stepped out of their houses during the Swadeshi movement and set afire British goods in Borivali. “That part of the history has been conveniently forgotten,” says another local. Families and friends of the arrested men says that none of them were involved in any illegal activities, let alone terrorism. They also express concerns over the manner in which the village was being linked to terrorist acts repeatedly.The villagers have now appointed a common lawyer to fight their case although it is not clear as to what charges the NIA has pressed against the 15 accused.“Padgha has been given a bad name because of one family, but that doesn’t mean the entire village has criminals. We have had instances of job letters being cancelled when the employer came to know that the person lives in Padgha. Many of our young boys are also struggling to find a match [for marriage]. Why should they be punished?” sayss Ravish Khot, a small-time realtor.“My son [26-year-old Yahya Khot] got married last year and his wife is expecting. Like in most houses of the village that were raided, nothing was found from our house too,” says Khot, who suffered a heart attack at the time of the raid and had to be rushed to a hospital in Bhiwandi. “Besides the men who have been arrested, the NIA officers are calling other people, as young as 14-15 year old, for questioning. Is that even fair?” asks Khot. Families cry foulSitting inside her partially dilapidated house, Rameeza Nachan (not related to Saquib Nachan) says she hasn't seen her two sons – Rafil (21) and Razil (22) since the day they were arrested by the NIA. “I was in Ajmer for a pilgrimage when the raids happened; both my boys were in the house at the time. Had I known this would happen, I would have never left them alone,” says Rameeza.“When I came home, the entire house was in a mess. I still don't know what the central agencies found in my house and arrested my children in such a serious case,” Rameeza wonders. 106349355Her two sons have been the only breadwinners for the family since her husband’s death five months ago. They used to drive a shared taxi on the Padgha-Bhiwandi route to feed the family. “We were waiting for Razil to finish his graduation so that he can look for a good job and earn better. But after this [the raid and arrest by NIA], we don't know what is in store for all of us. I don't even have money to pay for a lawyer,” she says. Claiming that her family has been living in Padgha for several decades now, Rameeza says the entire locality can vouch for the innocence of her family members. She has filed an application in the court, pleading that Razil be allowed to appear for his exam which he had missed due to his father’s death. Abubakar Kunnathpeedikal, father of another accused Munzir Kunnathpeedikal (37), says his son is a hardware engineer and runs his own internet and CCTV camera business. Munzir is married and has three children.“Officers started banging the door in the middle of the night. When I opened the door, they barged in and asked for Munzir. I woke him up and they said they had a search warrant. After searching the house, they took Munzir with them,\\\" says Abubakar. He shows TOI+ a document in which the officers had written that no item was seized from their house. “My son doesn’t even have an NC (non-cognisable offence) registered against him. Our family has nothing to do with the charges the police have levelled. In fact, Munzir worked on installing the internet line at the Padgha police station and the officers there knew him very well,” says Abubakar.",

    "text": "ABUJA – Aminu Umar-Sadiq, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), has assured that the current global economic volatility resulting from ongoing tariff wars will not negatively impact the Authority’s operations.\nSpeaking at NSIA’s 2024 Earnings Presentation to journalists, Umar-Sadiq emphasized that the Authority’s assets have been strategically allocated to protect it from market uncertainties. This comes as US President Donald Trump’s tariff impositions on various goods and services have triggered reciprocal measures, creating instability in the global economy.\n“If you look at our strategic assets’ allocation on the stabilization and the future generations fund side, you will see it is defensive. We have allocations to private equity, we have allocations to hedge funds, and we have allocations to real estate, inflation-linked funds,” Umar-Sadiq explained.\n“And so, whilst on the upside, where the markets are roaring, we may not be fully optimizing, what it does is that it protects us on the downside, which is very, very important, because if you look at the mandate of our sovereign wealth fund, it is largely a savings mandate.”\nAccording to documents provided by NSIA, total assets increased by 96% to ₦4.42 trillion in December 2024 from ₦2.26 trillion in December 2023, demonstrating steady asset growth aligned with equity strength.\nThis remarkable growth was attributed to increased returns from associates and joint venture entities, net gains on collateralized securities, and net foreign exchange gains resulting from naira depreciation.\nThe NSIA has maintained profitability for the 12th consecutive year, closing 2024 with a Total Comprehensive Income (TCI) of ₦1.89 trillion, bringing cumulative retained earnings to ₦3.74 trillion.\nTotal operating profits, excluding share of profits from associates and Joint Venture entities, grew from ₦1.17 trillion in 2023 to ₦1.86 trillion in 2024.\nUmar-Sadiq revealed that since its establishment in 2011, the Authority has received a total of $1.82 billion in net government contributions. “These funds have been efficiently utilized by NSIA resulting in a Net Asset Value (NAV) of $2.84 billion as at December, 2024,” he stated.\nThe NSIA was created by an Act of the National Assembly signed into law by the President on May 26, 2011. Its ownership structure shows that the Federal government holds 46.5 percent, States 34.8 percent, Local Government Areas 18.2 percent, while the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has 0.5 percent respectively.\nThe Authority’s Core TCI (excluding foreign exchange and derivative valuation gains) rose by 148% to ₦407.9 billion in 2024, supported by robust returns on financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss23. This includes returns from collateralized securities, private equity, hedge funds, and Exchange-Traded Funds.\n“The Authority’s outstanding financial performance in 2024 reflects the strength of our strategic vision, disciplined execution and unwavering commitment to sustainable socio-economic advancement,” Umar-Sadiq remarked.\n“As we move forward, we remain focused on driving economic transformation, expanding opportunities, scaling transformative impact and ensuring long-term prosperity for current and future generations of Nigerians.”",

    "text": "A new Microsoft report shows that China is conducting election interference in the United States by targeting multiple Republican candidates. Sharing a report on Wednesday regarding foreign election interference efforts, Microsoft said, “With two weeks until Election Day 2024, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) observes sustained influence efforts by Russia, Iran, and China aimed at undermining U.S. democratic processes.” Microsoft’s report revealed that China is trying to damage the 2024 campaigns of Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.), Michael McCaul (R-Texas), and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). The report also showed that China has targeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is not up for reelection in November. “Chinese influence operations have focused on down-ballot Republican candidates and members of Congress that advocate for anti-Chinese policies,” Microsoft stated. “Actors have parroted antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption, and promoted opposition candidates. While not always resulting in high levels of engagement, these efforts demonstrate China’s sustained attempts influence U.S. politics across the board.” According to Reuters, the Republican candidates are being targeted by Taizi Flood, which is a group that has been linked with China’s Ministry of Public Security. In response to Microsoft’s report of Chinese election interference, Reuters said a Chinese embassy spokesperson claimed China “has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election” and suggested that election interference claims were “full of malicious speculations.” McCaul told Reuters that being targeted by China was a “badge of honor” since he has made “standing up to the CCP a central part of my career.” Moore described the Chinese Communist Party as “anti-Semitic,” adding, “It isn’t surprising that they are targeting me and other politicians who support Israel to try to sow division in advance of the most important election in our lifetime.” READ MORE: Election results expected four days after Election Day, analyst warns Warning about the efforts of foreign nations to influence the 2024 election, Microsoft said, “History has shown foreign actors’ ability to rapidly distribute deceptive content can significantly impact public perception and electoral outcomes. With a particular focus on the 48 hours before and after Election Day, voters, government institutions, candidates, and parties must remain vigilant against deceptive and suspicious activity online.” In addition to China’s efforts to target Republican candidates, Microsoft’s report warned that Iran and China are using social media platforms to influence American voters ahead of the November election. “During times of heightened emotion, conflict, and competition, manipulated images, audio, and video often travel further and faster across audiences than during an average news cycle,” Microsoft said. “Foreign actors have proven nimble and capable of inserting deceptive content and distributing it rapidly during these moments.”",

    "text": "News of companies breaking the usual BTC treasury trend continues to emerge almost daily, and we can see everything from new players to established industry veterans shifting to the second-largest digital asset.\nThe DeFi-native Ethereum is steadily stealing the spotlight; only time will tell if the momentum will keep going, albeit there are currently no signs of a slowdown.\nThe Newcomer\nETH Strategy, Ethereum’s first autonomous treasury protocol to reimagine Saylor’s MSTR in a DeFi-native context, announced a milestone on X, having raised 12,342 ETH ($46.5M) to date. It only started to accrue the asset this summer.\nThis marked the end of the company’s pre-sale launch, and its on-chain protocol is expected to launch in phases soon. The total capital raised came from 3 sources: private sale, public sale, and puttable warrants. Warrants offer investors the right to sell the company shares back to them at a specific price at a future date.\nThe private sale raised 6,900 ETH, the public one garnered 1,242 Ether, and the warrants accounted for 4,200 of the asset. The tokens will be locked for the next 4-6 months following the token generation event (TGE).\nThe funds will be split into two categories: 11,817 ETH (~$44.6 million) will be allocated towards staking and liquidity, and the remaining 525 ETH (~$1.9 million) will be used for protocol growth and development.\nAccording to data collected at the time of writing, ETH Strategy is ranked 21st on StrategicEthReserve.\nFrom Bitcoin to Ethereum\nBTCS Inc. was the first cryptocurrency company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange (formerly AMEX, now NYSE MKT) in 2010 and subsequently went live on the NASDAQ in 2014. It initially operated as a BTC mining firm, and its transition to an ETH treasury began earlier this year.\nAccording to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the company plans to sell shares worth up to $2 billion to fund further cryptocurrency purchases, including ETH.\nThe S-3 statement further notes that the company is authorized to issue 975 million shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 20M shares of preferred stock, each with a nominal value of $0.001.\n“We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by us to provide additional funds for purchasing digital assets, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.”\nBTCS’ prospectus also reads that 5 million common stock shares are to be resold, which are from previously issued convertible notes and warrants.\nCurrently, BTCS Inc. is ranked number 10 on the leaderboard on StrategicEthReserve.\nUse this linkto register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance (\nfull details).\nLIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:\nUse this linkto register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!",
