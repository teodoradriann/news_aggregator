    "title": "Arizona ocelot footage: Endangered cat captured on camera | Phoenix New Times",
    "text": "A slinky spotted ocelot leaped from a rock and onto a branch before stopping to take a drink of water from a small pool. What one researcher called an “absolutely spectacular moment” was captured in a video on July 24 and publicized for the first time Thursday.\nOcelots are rare creatures, and even rarer in Arizona. Since 1982, the ocelot has been protected by the Endangered Species Act, and fewer than 100 are thought to remain in the U.S., according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Most of those reside in southern Texas.\nBefore this ocelot showed up, only six ocelots had been detected in Arizona since 2009, according to Russ McSpadden, a Southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity .\nIt was McSpadden who caught the new ocelot footage. Last week, the 45-year-old hiked Southern Arizona’s Sky Islands mountain range to collect SD cards from several trail cameras he’d placed in the area. When he viewed their footage on his computer, here is what he saw:\nBREAKING: We just released footage of a rare wild ocelot in a mountain range in Arizona, within the ancestral homelands of the Tohono O’odham Nation.\nFor the safety of the cat, we’re not specifying the location. https://t.co/YGzXYMXNnA pic.twitter.com/v5fDUn9Ji8\n— Center for Biological Diversity (@CenterForBioDiv) October 3, 2024\n“Seeing something so rare and so beautiful, knowing I’d been standing right there where this animal was sometime before me, it’s kind of an incomparable feeling,” he said.\nMcSpadden had never caught an ocelot on camera before. The ocelot is one of only two that have been spotted in Arizona in recent years. The other is an older ocelot — approximately 12 to 14 years of age — that Tucson school children have lovingly named Lil’ Jefe.\nThe younger ocelot — who needs a nickname — has been spotted once before. In early July, researchers from the Phoenix Zoo discovered that the same animal had been detected on June 14 in the Atascosa Highlands west of Nogales, around 30 miles southeast of where McSpadden’s camera captured it.\nThose researchers were just as awed, said Phoenix Zoo field conservation department project manager Kinley Ragan. She and a college had driven 45 minutes off-road and hiked another 40 minutes to check their trail cameras.\n“It was incredibly thrilling,” Ragan said. “I was in complete disbelief.”\nHow do they know it was the same cat? By the spots. An ocelot’s markings are like a fingerprint, and comparing the footage confirmed that McSpaddden’s and Ragan’s cats were “indeed the same cat,” McSpadden said.\nFor the cat to be found so far away from its first spotting was “really amazing, he added. The animal had to cross over or go under Interstate 19, the large freeway system that spans from Nogales north into Tucson. The distance also shows either location — east or west of I-19 — could serve as an ocelot habitat.\n“It’s a really intrepid cat that would make such an effort,” he said.\nWhile the rarest, the ocelot wasn’t the only creature McSpadden captured on his motion-detected camera that day. He also nabbed footage of a bobcat, gray fox, three species of skunk, some bears and the endangered Mexican spotted owl.\n“This is just one of the many really wonderful animals to show up on camera,” McSpadden said. “They're not all so elusive and elegant but still important.”",

    "title": "Bloody Mary Deviled Eggs Recipe",
    "text": "A riot of color, flavor, and texture make these cheerful Bloody Mary Deviled Egg appetizers an easy win.\nTable of Contents\nDeviled eggs have been an appetizer plate staple for decades, and with good reason. These ones elevate them to the next level, bringing a pop of color, a little spice, and the piquant zing of pickles to create a truly unique take on this classic. They’re quick and easy to prepare, are relatively healthy and are the perfect accompaniment to the classic cocktail that is their namesake. Of course, you can have them without a\nBloody Mary cocktail in your hand, but the two do pair beautifully together.\nLegend has it the Bloody Mary name comes from England’s Tudor Queen Mary, and its invention is widely accredited to Fernand Petiot in 1930’s New York, where the drink immediately took off as Prohibition waned.\nThe Bloody Mary Deviled Egg does not have the same storied history, but I think it should, because it packs a flavor and texture punch that’s hard to beat.\nThis recipe starts with the classic ingredients of a traditional deviled egg, but adds a pop of beautiful red and green color as well as a number of classic flavorings to make something that is at once smooth, creamy, crunchy, spicy, and slightly tart. Pass these around at your next cocktail party and you’ll have a guaranteed hit on your hands.\nAre Bloody Mary Deviled Eggs Healthy?\nEggs are a healthy and satisfying food, packing good fats, protein, vitamins, and minerals in a handy little package. Unlike many popular finger foods, they are not fried and are gluten-free, making them suitable for a wide range of diets.\nEggs from pasture raised hens are known to be more nutrient dense than regular eggs, though both are regarded as healthy foods. Eggs marked as “free run” are largely the same as regular eggs in both nutrition and flavor, and are generally considered to be more of a marketing gimmick than coming from happier chickens. Whichever eggs you choose, this is a healthy, delicious and filling snack.\nA better hangover cure than a Bloody Mary?\nThe Bloody Mary Cocktail has a reputation for being a great hangover cure. This has no basis in science, and there is little anecdotal evidence that this is the case. However, an argument can be made for these delicious and filling appetizers to take that crown, as the nutrient punch of these eggs can certainly help normalize body chemistry after an indulgent night.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 12 Eggs\n- ¼ cup Mayonnaise\n- 1 Tbsp horseradish\n- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 Tbsp Tomato paste\n- ½ tsp Tabasco\n- 1 tsp Paprika\n- Salt and pepper\n- ¼ cup Old Bay Seasoning\n- ¼ cup Sliced pickles\n- Celery Leaves\nINSTRUCTIONS\nBoil\nGently drop the eggs into a pot of boiling salted water and boil for 10 minutes.\nCool\nUse a spoon to scoop the eggs out and place them in a bowl full of ice water to cool down until they are cold enough to handle.\nCut\nCut the eggs in half lengthways and then scoop out the yolk\nBlend\nPop the yolks into a food processor with the mayonnaise, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, Tabasco, paprika, and salt and pepper. Process the yolk mix until it is completely smooth. If it seems a bit too thick add in a little more mayonnaise.\nScoop\nScoop the mix into a piping bag.\nDip\nDip each egg half into the old bay seasoning on the flat side and lay it on a plate.\nFill\nPipe the yolk mix into each egg so that it mounds up a little then add in a celery leaf and a pickle.\nDEVOUR!\nTips and Tricks to Make Perfect Bloody Mary Deviled Eggs\n- Use the best paprika you can find. I like Hungarian paprika for its color and depth of flavor. You can also try a smoked paprika for an unexpected twist, especially at a barbecue. Hot paprika can give you an extra hit if you’re a fan of cranking up the Scoville scale!\n- Use your imagination: Depending on what you’re serving these with, play around with the seasoning and garnish. These are delicious as described here, but you can try using a little chili powder in your spice mix if you’re serving Tex-Mex food, and add a cilantro leaf to the garnish… or even top them with mini steamed shrimp.\nFAQs\nIf you’ve prepared the eggs in advance, the surface of the whites might dry up a little. Simply wipe the cut side with a damp paper towel and the seasoning will stick just fine.\nThis can happen if your paprika isn’t the freshest; it should have a bright red color. You can always add a little extra paprika or tomato paste. 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric will make your yolk mixture much more yellow.\nOnce your eggs are cooked, let them sit in the ice bath for 10-15 minutes. This makes the whites contract slightly and pull away from the shell, making them super easy to peel.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nBloody Mary Deviled Eggs are best assembled just before serving, but you can prepare all the components in advance, making assembly a snap. Store the spice mixture in a air-tight container on your counter. The egg whites and filling can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. The garnish is best made fresh just before serving. These don’t freeze well, though I doubt you’ll have any leftovers!\nIngredients\n- 12 Eggs\n- ¼ cup Mayonnaise\n- 1 Tbsp horseradish\n- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 Tbsp\nTomato paste\n- ½ tsp Tabasco\n- 1 tsp\nPaprika\n- Salt and pepper\n- ¼ cup Old Bay Seasoning\n- ¼ cup Sliced pickles\n- Celery Leaves\nInstructions\n- Gently drop the eggs into a pot of boiling salted water and boil for 10 minutes.\n- Use a spoon to scoop the eggs out and place them in a bowl full of ice water to cool down until they are cold enough to handle.\n- Cut the eggs in half lengthways and then scoop out the yolk\n- Pop the yolks into a food processor with the mayonnaise, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, Tabasco, paprika, and salt and pepper.

    "text": "Marine scientists tagging pygmy blue whales off the Ningaloo coast in Western Australia (WA) have\nspotted a tiny calf, thought to be the smallest of the species ever sighted in Australian waters.\nThe little calf photographed swimming alongside its feeding mother off the coast of WA was captured by spotter pilot Tiffany Klein from Ningaloo Aviation during a research project to satellite tag pygmy blue whales undertaken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Centre for Whale Research (CWR).\nPhotographs and video footage of pygmy blue whales are helping scientists draw back the veil on the mysterious reproductive lives of these endangered animals.\nThe Ningaloo calf was about a third of the size of its mother – approximately 6-7m – and the researchers think the calf is just weeks old.\n“Looking at the size of the calf compared to its mother, it’s possible it may have been born in waters near key feeding grounds in the Perth canyon further south,” says AIMS lead research scientist on the project, Michele Thums.\n“Some experts think they may give birth, or calve, soon after leaving their foraging grounds, which for this population is the Perth canyon.\n“No one really knows where pygmy blue whales calve, but here in the Indian Ocean, they are thought to breed and calve at the end of their northward migration off WA’s coast and in Indonesian waters.\n“Having consulted with other experts in that region, a calf of this size is not something that’s been observed before by any of them.”\nMeantime to the north west of Australia at the whale nursery near Timor-Leste a decade-long citizen science program has\ncaptured also some of the first-ever recorded evidence of reproduction in pygmy blue whales, including underwater footage of a mother nursing its calf. []https://cosmosmagazine.com/newsletter/\nUnderwater video footage of a pygmy blue whale mother and nursing calf, captured for the first time. Credit: Angel Lai / ‘Insider Divers’ 2022 Expedition\nLeader of the citizen science program, marine ecologist Karen Edyvane of Charles Darwin University, says the blue whale’s reproductive and calving behaviour has remained largely unknown in the scientific community.\n“Our program has documented some of the lesser-known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time. It’s very, very exciting,” she says.\n“From newborn calves and nursing mothers to amorous adults in courtship, the waters of Timor-Leste really are providing blue whale scientists with some of our first glimpses into the private lives of one of the world’s largest but most elusive animals.”\nDr Capri Jolliffe of Curtin University says the long-term monitoring in Timor Leste is providing critical insights into the ecology of the Austral-Indonesian population of pygmy blue whales.\n“This research clearly highlights that the life history characteristics and patterns of habitat use of pygmy blue whales differ significantly from their Antarctic blue whale counterparts. They really are tropical animals,” says Jolliffe.\nPygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) are a smaller subspecies of\nblue whale, growing to lengths of about 24 meters compared to the larger 30m.\nAIMS and CWR scientists use satellite tags and dive loggers to better understand their migratory routes and key feeding areas in Australia.\nDo you care about the oceans?

    "text": "Una donna si mette il ventaglio a Madrid, Spagna, 10 luglio 2023. Secondo l&#039;Organizzazione mondiale della sanità (Oms) in Europa il caldo uccide più di 175.000 persone all&#039;anno. A livello globale tra il 2000 e il 2019 sono stati registrati circa 489.000 decessi legati al caldo. L&#039;Europa è il continente che si sta riscaldando più rapidamente sulla Terra ed è qui che il caldo ha causato il maggior numero di vittime. La valutazione dell&#039;agenzia delle Nazioni Unite giunge pochi giorni dopo l&#039;appello all&#039;azione contro il caldo estremo lanciato dal Segretario generale dell&#039;Onu António Guterres. &quot;Miliardi di persone stanno affrontando un&#039;epidemia di caldo estremo, appassendo sotto ondate di calore sempre più letali, con temperature che superano i 50 gradi Celsius in tutto il mondo&quot;, ha dichiarato Guterres il 25 luglio, sulla scia di tre giorni di caldo record. &quot;Il caldo estremo è la nuova anormalità&quot;, ha aggiunto, indicando come causa il &quot;cambiamento climatico indotto dai combustibili fossili&quot;. &quot;Ma la buona notizia è che possiamo salvare vite umane e limitarne l&#039;impatto&quot;, ha detto Guterres, indicando soluzioni in quattro aree critiche. In che modo il caldo estremo sta mietendo vittime in Europa? Le temperature in Europa stanno aumentando a un tasso doppio rispetto alla media mondiale. &quot;In tutta la regione le persone stanno pagando il prezzo più alto&quot;, afferma il direttore regionale dell&#039;Oms per l&#039;Europa, Hans Henri P. Kluge. Delle circa 489.000 persone che muoiono ogni anno a causa del caldo estremo, l&#039;Europa ne ospita il 36%, circa 176.040 persone. I tre anni più caldi mai registrati in Europa si sono tutti verificati a partire dal 2020, mentre i 10 anni più caldi si sono verificati a partire dal 2007. Negli ultimi 20 anni si è registrata un&#039;impennata del 30% della mortalità legata al caldo, con un aumento dei decessi in quasi tutti i Paesi. Secondo il dottor Kluge le temperature estreme aggravano le condizioni croniche, tra cui le malattie cardiovascolari, respiratorie e cerebro-vascolari, i problemi mentali e le condizioni legate al diabete. Il caldo estremo è un problema soprattutto per gli anziani, in particolare per quelli che vivono da soli, e per le donne in gravidanza. Come possiamo proteggerci dal caldo estremo? &quot;Gli effetti negativi del caldo sulla salute sono in gran parte prevenibili attraverso buone pratiche di salute pubblica, quindi se ci prepariamo meglio salveremo molte vite, sia ora che in futuro&quot;, afferma il dottor Kluge. A livello nazionale più di 20 Paesi europei hanno piani d&#039;azione per aiutare i cittadini ad adattarsi a questo aspetto del cambiamento climatico. L&#039;Oms avverte però che è necessario fare di più per proteggere le comunità. Nel Centro europeo per l&#039;ambiente e la salute di Bonn, in Germania, l&#039;agenzia sanitaria sta sviluppando un piano d&#039;azione aggiornato per aiutare i governi a prepararsi. Ma ci sono molti piccoli accorgimenti che le persone possono prendere per proteggeresi. La campagna annuale dell&#039;Oms #KeepCool illustra quattro modi fondamentali: Tenersi lontani dal caldo: evitare di uscire e di svolgere attività faticose nelle ore più calde della giornata. Rimanere all&#039;ombra e non lasciare bambini o animali nei veicoli parcheggiati. Se necessario e possibile trascorrere 2-3 ore della giornata in un luogo fresco, come un supermercato o un cinema. Mantenere la casa fresca: utilizzare l&#039;aria notturna per raffreddare la casa. Ridurre il carico di calore all&#039;interno della casa o della camera d&#039;albergo durante il giorno utilizzando tende o tapparelle. Mantenere il corpo fresco e idratato: utilizzare indumenti leggeri e larghi e biancheria da letto leggera, fare docce o bagni freschi e bere regolarmente acqua evitando bevande zuccherate, alcoliche o contenenti caffeina a causa del loro effetto disidratante sul corpo. Prendetevi cura di voi stessi e degli altri: controllate la famiglia, gli amici e i vicini, soprattutto gli anziani, che passano molto tempo da soli. Come si possono limitare le morti dovute al caldo? Nel discorso tenuto a a New York la scorsa settimana Guterres ha delineato quattro aree critiche di azione. La cura delle persone vulnerabili è al primo posto. Poiché il caldo torrido amplifica le disuguaglianze, il segretario delle Nazioni Unite ha in mente alcune soluzioni di livellamento, tra cui un accesso più massiccio al raffreddamento a basse emissioni di CO2. È inoltre necessario potenziare i sistemi di allerta precoce. I Paesi sviluppati dovrebbero mantenere le loro promesse di finanziamento per aiutare i Paesi in via di sviluppo a proteggere i loro cittadini dalle temperature elevate. Il secondo punto dell&#039;appello di Guterres è il rafforzamento della protezione dei lavoratori. &quot;La regione dell&#039;Europa e dell&#039;Asia centrale è quella che ha visto aumentare più rapidamente l&#039;esposizione della forza lavoro al caldo eccessivo&quot;, ha sottolineato. Poiché il caldo eccessivo è la causa di quasi 23 milioni di infortuni sul lavoro in tutto il mondo, è essenziale che le leggi e i regolamenti - fondati sui diritti umani - vengano aggiornati e fatti rispettare. Al terzo posto dell&#039;agenda del numero uno delle Nazioni Unite c&#039;è il rafforzamento della resilienza delle economie e delle società. I &quot;Piani d&#039;azione per il calore&quot; su misura sono una parte della risposta, ha sottolineato Guterres: bisogna usare la scienza e i dati per &quot;rendere a prova di calore&quot; le economie, i settori critici e l&#039;ambiente costruito. E infine, il punto di partenza: limitare l&#039;aumento della temperatura globale a 1,5°C. &quot;Per affrontare tutti questi sintomi (siccità, incendi, innalzamento del livello del mare), dobbiamo combattere la malattia - ha detto Guterres -. La malattia è la follia di incenerire la nostra unica casa. La malattia è la dipendenza dai combustibili fossili. La malattia è l&#039;inazione climatica&quot;. Guterres ha richiamato l&#039;attenzione sull&#039;espansione dell&#039;uso dei combustibili fossili in alcuni dei Paesi più ricchi del mondo e ha esortato tutte le nazioni a presentare, entro il prossimo anno, piani d&#039;azione nazionali per il clima che siano in linea con il mantenimento dell&#039;obiettivo di 1,5 gradi centigradi.",

    "text": "La mère d'un enfant atteint d'un cancer a vivement critiqué la décision d'Easyjet de surfacturer le billet de son fils pour partir en vacances à Chypre. La compagnie s'est excusée et a décidé de rembourser la surfacturation, mais pour elle, le mal est fait. \"J'étais en aberration totale.\" Valérie pousse, jeudi sur RMC, un cri de colère contre la compagnie aérienne Easyjet. La jeune femme prévoit de partir en vacances à Chypre, en septembre prochain, avec son fils, Matéis, atteint d'un cancer pour souffler un peu.\nAprès avoir enchaîné 22 semaines de chimiothérapie, son fils ne peut plus bouger sa jambe. Elle prévient alors Easyjet que Matéis prendra plus d'espace dans l'avion et devra occuper plusieurs places. \"On m'a dit 'ah non ce n'est pas possible madame, il va y avoir un surcoût, ça fera 217 euros'\", raconte la mère.\nEasyjet reconnaît \"une erreur humaine\" Dépitée, la maman paye, mais c’est en en parlant avec les médecins de son fils que la colère monte: \"Je ne trouve pas ça normal de sans arrêt devoir se justifier. Il faut que ça s'arrête. Il n'y a pas d'empathie en fait.\"\n\"Se faire de l'argent sur une personne dans le champ du handicap, ce n'est franchement pas normal\", insiste Valérie. Contacté par RMC , Easyjet a présenté ses excuses à la famille et va rembourser la surfacturation, tout en assurant que le bien-être de ses clients est une priorité. Mais pour Valérie, le mal est fait. \"Moi je n'accepte pas du tout leurs excuses parce que si ils transportent autant de personnes en mobilité réduite, pourquoi ils m'ont proposé dès le départ de régler ces sièges en supplément. C'est de la mauvaise foi\", regrette-t-elle.\nFaute de place adaptée, Matéis voyagera sur trois sièges pour pouvoir allonger sa jambe. La compagnie aérienne Easyjet a reconnu une \"erreur humaine\".\nPierre Bourgès (avec TRC)",

    "text": "Xavier University of Louisiana is making history with the launch of its Master of Science in Genetic Counseling program, marking a significant milestone as the first accredited program of its kind in Louisiana. This initiative reinforces the university’s longstanding commitment to transforming healthcare practices.\nReynold Verret, president of Xavier University , emphasized the importance of this program in continuing the institution’s legacy of promoting diversity and equity within the healthcare sector. “This program is another way we stay true to our mission of creating a more just and humane society.,” said Verret.\nThe new Genetic Counseling program aims to train students in clinical skills and ethical practices emphasizing compassion and cultural sensitivity. Students will learn to guide families in understanding the implications of genetic conditions through a cutting-edge curriculum that integrates the latest advancements in genetic counseling techniques. Accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling, this program aims to address health disparities by helping individuals and communities navigate their genetic health challenges.\nDiversifying the Field Alix D’Angelo, assistant program director and clinical assistant professor, highlighted the urgent need for diverse representation within the field. “There’s a minimal number of genetic counselors from minority populations to serve as clinical supervisors, program faculty, and leadership,” D’Angelo stated. “Being one of the only accredited genetic counseling programs at a historically Black college and university is meaningful.”\nThe program, which is supported by Myriad Genetics and collaborated with Ochsner Health, aims to enhance diversity within the genetic counseling profession while promoting equitable healthcare access across Louisiana.\nDr. Leonardo Seoane, founding dean of the Xavier Ochsner College of Medicine, expressed enthusiasm for the new partnership. “What we were missing in Louisiana is that we do not have a genetic counseling program. The [Ochsner Health] partnership with Xavier to start the first genetic counseling program in Louisiana is very exciting,” he said.\nThe Genetic Counseling program seeks to cultivate skilled professionals and empower students to advocate for underserved communities. The university aspires to equip future counselors with the tools to effectively support their patients in navigating complex health landscapes, ultimately improving health outcomes.",

    "text": "Conciliación laboral: trabajadoras insisten en débil cumplimiento y piden más fiscalización a la DT Desde la organización Yo Quiero Estar critican que la ley es confusa, y que no está claro el mecanismo para realizar denuncias. [Carolina León](/autor/carolina_leon)| Publicado: Viernes 13 de septiembre de 2024 a las 04:00 hrs. - T+ - T- A fines de enero entró en vigencia en el país la Ley de Conciliación de la vida personal, familiar y laboral, una normativa que otorga el derecho a desempeñar trabajo a distancia o teletrabajo a aquellas personas que son madres o padres responsables de niños o niñas menores de 14 años, o que tengan a su cargo el cuidado de una persona con discapacidad o en situación de dependencia severa o moderada. Una legislación sumamente esperada, principalmente, por las trabajadoras locales. A más de seis meses de su partida, desde la organización de la sociedad civil Yo Quiero Estar acusan un débil cumplimiento de la norma por parte de las empresas, y piden que la autoridad potencie las fiscalizaciones en torno a este tema. Según explicó la cofundadora de la organización, Verónica Campino, han recibido diversas denuncias e, incluso, informes de fiscalización que evidencian que las empresas no están otorgando teletrabajo. “De acuerdo a nuestros indicadores, hay empresas que no han aceptado ninguna solicitud de teletrabajo y son las mismas empresas que luego ganan premios de ‘Best Place to Work’ o ‘Mejor lugar para trabajar para padres y madres’. Ojo ahí”, cuestionó Campino. Además, la vocera agregó que las bases de datos administrativos no estarían reflejando esta problemática. “De acuerdo a información que nos ha hecho llegar la subsecretaría del Trabajo -a través de una mesa de trabajo que busca monitorear la implementación de la ley de conciliación de la que somos parte- han habido muy pocas denuncias y eso no conversa con los datos internos que manejamos”, señaló. Para Campino, una de las razones que podría explicar este fenómeno es que la plataforma de la Dirección del Trabajo no sería clara. “Hay un banner sobre la Ley de 40 horas y la Ley Karin, pero nada sobre conciliación. En otros casos, en las oficinas de la DT les dicen que no corresponde una denuncia, pues la ley establece que queda a discreción del empleador. No pareciera haber un esfuerzo por parte de la DT para implementar correctamente esta ley ni de capacitar a sus fiscalizadores” opinó. Los testimonios Para graficar la magnitud de la problemática, la organización ha recopilado diversos testimonios de mujeres. En uno de ellos, una trabajadora cuenta que solicitó trabajo remoto al 100%, el cual fue rechazado por la empresa. “Hice una carta para justificar, mis funciones son compatibles y también fue rechazada. Se me volvió a ofrecer la jornada híbrida de toda la empresa (dos días de teletrabajo y sábado por medio). Acudí a la DT y el fiscalizador le encontró la razón a la empresa pues me ofrecieron una alternativa”, relató la mujer, quien agregó que a fin de mes le llegó una carta de desvinculación. Otra mujer cuenta que solicitó en febrero a su empleador tener una jornada híbrida, con trabajo presencial en las mañana y tardes de teletrabajo. “Hasta la fecha, no he tenido respuesta formal, trabajé toda la pandemia con teletrabajo. Hice una denuncia en la DT en junio y, hasta la fecha, no me asignan fiscalizador. Mis labores son totalmente administrativas ya que es todo gestión por sistemas”, expuso. Por este, y otros casos, Campino reforzó la necesidad de que la autoridad se haga cargo de dar más certezas jurídicas a las madres cuidadoras y que, al mismo tiempo, se potencie el rol fiscalizador de la Dirección del Trabajo. A la fecha, la DT ha logrado cursar algunas multas a empresas que se han negado a otorgar teletrabajO. En el listado figuran firmas relacionadas a la producción de alimentos, banca, servicios, industria, entre otros.",
