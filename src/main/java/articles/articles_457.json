    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "These 4 unflashy mid-cap stocks are on track to be tomorrow's mega-caps, according to one $3.2 billion fund manager\nRead in app\n- Lori Keith says there's one part of the market that's been overlooked this year: mid-caps.\n- Mid-cap stocks offer quality and significant upside, says Keith, a PM at Parnassus Investments.\n- Keith shares 4 mid-cap stocks dominating their industries and on track to be tomorrow's mega-caps.\nIf you invested $1,000 in Nvidia just five years ago, you'd have over $27,500 today.\nThe key to maximizing stock-market returns is to buy in early before the hype. The Magnificent Seven have incredibly high market caps now, but they were small- and mid-sized companies before they were market behemoths.\nThat's why Lori Keith, director of research and portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments, is such a big fan of mid-cap stocks. Keith oversees $3.2 billion of assets in the Parnassus Mid Cap Fund. Her investment strategy centers on finding quality companies with long runways for revenue and profit growth.\nInvestor sentiment this year has been mainly focused on mega-caps and small-caps, with not much appreciation for the middle. But Keith believes mid-caps offer the best of both worlds. Small caps have high growth potential but are also high-risk and often unprofitable. On the other hand, large caps may have difficulty sustaining high growth rates going forward, meaning that there's limited upside.\nMid-cap companies are usually defined as those with market caps from around $2 billion to $10 billion, but Keith takes a more liberal definition, considering companies valued even over $100 billion.\n\"It's a really attractive place for investors,\" Keith said of mid-cap stocks. \"There are really strong defendable businesses that often have the ability to capture additional growth relative to the large-cap stocks that are a bit more saturated.\"\nThe mid-caps with the most potential are usually not household names, Keith said. But they do have strong balance sheets with plentiful free cash flow and low debt, and often have sufficient capital to expand overseas and fund acquisitions. And most importantly, Keith is looking for companies with a differentiated product in the market, or what Warren Buffett has dubbed an \"economic moat.\"\nUnder this strategy, several of Keith's picks have quickly expanded their businesses and outgrown the mid-cap label. Keith is particularly bullish on mid-caps in areas of the market such as software, semiconductors, real estate, and healthcare.\nBelow, she shares 4 mid-cap companies with strong long-term growth prospects and the potential to become market dominants. They are all constituents of the Parnassus Mid Cap Fund.\n4 mid-caps set to become the mega-caps of the future\nCBRE\nMarket cap: $37.3 billion\nInvestment rationale: CBRE is the world's largest real estate investment firm and services provider for occupiers, owners, lenders, and investors across multiple types of commercial real estate categories. Keith likes CBRE for its industry-leading position, which gives it strong recurring revenues from global clients. Over 95% of the Fortune 100 utilize CBRE's services. Additionally, secular tailwinds in the real estate industry, such as decreasing interest rates and increasing buying activity and construction, will also give CBRE a boost.\nFortinet\nMarket cap: $63.4 billion\nInvestment rationale: Keith added Fortinet to the fund in 2023 due to its strong growth profile and dominance in the network security space. Fortinet offers products such as firewalls, endpoint security, network security appliances, and VPNs, which are increasingly important for customers as security breaches become more advanced and common. Keith points to the recent cyberattack on American Water Works, the largest water utility in the US, as an example of just how important effective cybersecurity solutions are.\nKLA Corporation\nMarket cap: $107.6 billion\nInvestment rationale: KLA provides process control technology, which is a key component in the semiconductor chip design process. The technology identifies defects in chips prior to production. For Keith, KLA is a picks-and-shovels opportunity to buy into the AI investment theme while avoiding the mega-cap stocks that other investors are piling into. The company's proprietary technology and pricing power allow it to innovate and stay ahead of competitors, Keith said. She also points to signs of good company management: KLA's employee turnover rates are much lower than other companies in the industry.\nGuidewire\nMarket cap: $15.4 billion\nInvestment rationale: Guidewire is the largest cloud-based software solution provider for the insurance industry. As more insurance providers migrate their operations to the cloud, Keith believes Guidewire is positioned to capitalize upon increased demand domestically and internationally. She points to Guidewire's well-established relationships with insurance carriers, recurring revenue streams, and brand reputation as signs of future growth.\nRead next\nInvesting\nStock Picks\nStock Market\nMore...\nAdvertisement",

Back in school, I faced relentless bullying. When I turned to my parents for help, they chose forgiveness over confrontation. They believed it was the higher road, but inside, I felt abandoned and unprotected. The decision left me questioning: Was I not worth fighting for? The echoes of those days still linger, a reminder of pain overlooked and voices unheard. How do you reconcile with being told to forgive when all you needed was to feel safe? Did I deserve more? Would things have been different if they had stood up for me? I still don’t know.\n[ · user · 26.8K followers](/m/northern-kentucky-tribune-1710159)\nNorthern Kentucky Tribune\nMedicaid work requirement changes could further depress Kentucky communities\nSome Kentucky lawmakers want to make it mandatory for some Medicaid participants in Kentucky to work, but experts say that would disproportionately affect people with mental health or substance use disorders.\n[ · user · 3.4K followers](/m/the-observer-1797592)\nthe OBserver\nWhen your ‘pelvic exam’ becomes a bladder disaster… but at least the doc has a sense of humor!\nWhen Tension Took Control… During a Pap Smear … 🤣.

    "text": "With iOS 26 update, Apple gives parents more control over who kids can text\nApple's iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families.\nIn Short\n- Apple is giving parents more power over who their kids can talk to on their iPhones\n- Whenever a child tries to message someone new, the parent will get a request in the Messages app\n- The new approval system works beyond just iMessage\nApple’s iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families. With growing concerns around online safety for children, Apple is giving parents more power over who their kids can talk to on their iPhones. Now, whenever a child tries to message someone new, the parent will get a request in the Messages app and can approve or deny it with a single tap. This makes it harder for unknown contacts to reach children and gives parents a better grip on their kids’ digital lives â€” all without needing to constantly check their devices.\nThe new approval system works beyond just iMessage. Apple is opening it up to third-party apps through a new tool called PermissionKit. So, if a child tries to follow someone on a social media app or send a friend request, the parent can still step in. Even if a child doesn’t have a dedicated ‘Child Account’, Apple is applying sensible limits like web filters and communication blocks by default for teens. There are also better age ratings in the App Store, such as 13+, 16+ and 18+, so parents can make more informed choices before letting their child download an app.\nCommunication Safety is also seeing a major upgrade. iOS 26 will now automatically blur photos with nudity in FaceTime calls and shared photo albums. Parents will also be able to grant exceptions if they’re okay with their child downloading an app that’s rated older than their set restrictions. The whole experience feels more flexible while still putting safety first.\nBut there’s a lot more to iOS 26 than just parental controls. The update introduces a fresh new look with Liquid Glass â€” a glossy, translucent design that makes app icons, widgets, and system menus feel more alive and dynamic.

For everyone else, a public beta rolls out next month through the Apple Beta Software Programme.\nApple’s iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families. With growing concerns around online safety for children, Apple is giving parents more power over who their kids can talk to on their iPhones. Now, whenever a child tries to message someone new, the parent will get a request in the Messages app and can approve or deny it with a single tap. This makes it harder for unknown contacts to reach children and gives parents a better grip on their kids’ digital lives â€” all without needing to constantly check their devices.\nThe new approval system works beyond just iMessage. Apple is opening it up to third-party apps through a new tool called PermissionKit. So, if a child tries to follow someone on a social media app or send a friend request, the parent can still step in. Even if a child doesn’t have a dedicated ‘Child Account’, Apple is applying sensible limits like web filters and communication blocks by default for teens. There are also better age ratings in the App Store, such as 13+, 16+ and 18+, so parents can make more informed choices before letting their child download an app.\nCommunication Safety is also seeing a major upgrade. iOS 26 will now automatically blur photos with nudity in FaceTime calls and shared photo albums. Parents will also be able to grant exceptions if they’re okay with their child downloading an app that’s rated older than their set restrictions. The whole experience feels more flexible while still putting safety first.\nBut there’s a lot more to iOS 26 than just parental controls. The update introduces a fresh new look with Liquid Glass â€” a glossy, translucent design that makes app icons, widgets, and system menus feel more alive and dynamic.

    "title": "Armstrong candlelight ceremony honours fallen WWII soldiers - Kelowna Capital News",
    "text": "The cenotaph at Armstrong’s Memorial Park was aglow with candles Saturday, Dec. 23, as people from the community came out into the cold to honour each and every local solider who lost their lives during the Second World War. The 26th annual candlelight ceremony was a chance for members of the community to take part in honouring those lost to the war. In total, 39 candles were placed at the cenotaph by 39 relatives, friends, family members and students, one for each Armstrong-Spallumcheen soldier who died defending freedom in the Second World War. A 40th candle was lit to honour all the unknown soldiers who died during the war. Ken Brandel, past president of the Armstrong Legion, described the candlelight ceremonies that began in the Netherlands to show thanks to the Canadians who helped liberate the country and its people from German occupation. He described a special ceremony the Dutch held in 1995 to commemorate their liberation by Canadian forces. Brandel opened the ceremony in Armstrong by reading from Canadian historian J.L. Granatstein’s account of the Canadian First Army that fought its way from Juno Beach at D-Day in 1944, through to Normandy, and went on to liberate the Netherlands. Granatstein’s article, published in Maclean’s Magazine, was titled The Best Little Army in the World. “We began in the Holland cemetery and what struck me at once were the many Dutch families moving quietly around headstones, each with a candle and carved maple leaf with the name, date of death and the unit of each soldier,” Brandel said, quoting Granatstein’s article. He then described a crowd of half a million Dutch citizens that gathered in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, for a victory parade. “This was the most extraordinary event I have ever seen,” said Brandel, again quoting Granatstein. Saturday’s event in Armstrong was a tad smaller — roughly 75 people attended — but it was a touching display of remembrance. The ceremony also featured a firsthand account of those days in the Netherlands when the country was liberated by Canadian forces. Rudy Driessen took the mic to address the crowd, saying he was around six years old when the war ended in 1945. Tracing his early childhood memories, he recalled an interaction he had with a German soldier. Near his home in the Netherlands, young Driessen had come across a soldier who was eating a meal with his rifle propped up next to him. Driessen said the solider had beckoned to him to come closer. “He was eating food and he started to share it with me, “Driessen told the crowd. “Not all German soldiers were bad guys.” Driessen still holds memories of his country’s liberation and the Canadian soldiers who helped made it possible. “What an experience that was for five years,” he said. “There was an occupation and many soldiers, Canadian soldiers, gave up their lives for our liberty, for our freedom.” Driessen voiced his appreciation for the people who came out to the ceremony before wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. The ceremony proceeded to the laying of the candles at the cenotaph. The names of the 39 fallen soldiers and the date of their death were read aloud before each placing of a candle. The ceremony ended with a playing of The Last Post and Rouse, followed by a moment of silence.

    "title": "Sombre nativity in Bethlehem's Manger Square includes barbed wire",
    "text": "Palestinian Christians held a sombre Christmas vigil in Bethlehem on Saturday, at the church situated on the spot where it's believed Jesus Christ was born. In a nativity scene deliberately strewn with barbed wire and rubble in Manger Square, there were candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations. Most years, Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the story of Jesus' life, born in a stable because there was no room for his parents at the inn, and placed in an animal's manger, the humblest of all possible beds. Some 2,000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the reputed location of that stable in Bethlehem's Byzantine-era Church of the Nativity, where most Christmases there are joyful displays of lights and trees in Manger Square. But with Israel's campaign in Gaza having killed more than 20,000 people according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, the mostly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank are in mourning too. This year they decided to have no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations because of the carnage taking place only 50km (30 miles) away. And in place of the usual nativity scene, Bethlehem churches this year placed the models amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza. \"Bethlehem is a message. It is not a city, it is a message of peace to the whole world. From this sacred place we convey a message of peace ... stop the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge,\" said Father Ibrahim Faltas, a friar at the vigil. Christians make up around 2% of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organised by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza. The war, triggered by a Hamas attack on Israeli towns on 7 October has kept away the majority of expected foreign tourists hoping to celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem. When church leaders convened at Bethlehem in early December to mark the start of Advent, there were few people in the usually crowded streets and squares to watch the pared-down display. \"This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning. We feel sad,\" said the town mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square.",
