    "text": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban lent his support to his long-time ally Donald Trump's bid to return to White House after meeting the former U.S. president in Florida late on Friday.\nThe two discussed \"a wide range of issues affecting Hungary and the United States, including the paramount importance of strong and secure borders to protect the sovereignty of each nation,\" according to a statement from Trump's campaign.\nOrban has long been at odds with his fellow European Union members over a range of issues, including refusing to send weapons to Ukraine and keeping up economic ties with Moscow since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022.\nOrban has said only the return of Republican candidate Trump to the White House could bring peace in Ukraine.\n\"We need leaders in the world who are respected and can bring peace. He is one of them! Come back and bring us peace, Mr. President!,\" Orban said in a post on X after the meeting.\nOrban, admired by many conservatives in the United States for his tough policies on immigration, his family support schemes and vocal stance on national sovereignty, said in a video on his Facebook page that under Trump's 2017-2021 presidency there was peace in the Middle East and also Ukraine.\nHe said there would not be a war in Ukraine right now if Trump had been re-elected in 2020.\nOrban has regularly been at loggerheads with the EU over his anti-immigration campaigns and moves to put the judiciary, NGOs, and media under more state control, which critics say have eroded democracy in Hungary.\nOrban has also criticised EU sanctions against Russia, although never vetoed them in the end, and held up an EU decision on granting new aide for Ukraine last December until finally agreeing to it early this year.\n(Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Frances Kerry)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "The Green Bay Packers are entering the 2024 season as a trendy Super Bowl pick after rebounding from a 3-6 start and making an impressive playoff run during the first year of the Jordan Love era in 2023. Love is now the highest-paid quarterback in football, the young offense has a year under its belt and the defense is moving forward with a new, aggressive defensive coordinator and a big-time addition in safety Xavier McKinney. The highly anticipated season kicks off Friday night against the Philadelphia Eagles in Brazil. The staff at Packers Wire makes W-L record and outcome predictions before the start of the 2024 season: Zach Kruse, managing editor 11-6: This has all the makings of a special season. The Packers offense could be one of the NFL's best, given the combination of Jordan Love's ascendancy to end last season, the depth of weapons around the quarterback position, the potential of the offensive line and Matt LaFleur's dynamic, versatile scheme. While there are question marks on defense, particularly at linebacker and cornerback, the talent level is considerably better entering 2024 and Jeff Hafley's scheme might finally unlock the disruptive ability of a deep front. On paper, the Packers should be terrific at both throwing the football and defending the pass, two important factors for playing winning football each week. There will be bumps along the way. The NFC North is improved, and the schedule isn't as forgiving as last year. But there's no reason why the Packers, if healthy, can't get to double-digit wins and be in contention to win the division from start to finish. In a best-case scenario, the Packers start fast and rise to the top of the NFC, securing a top seed in the postseason. I think they probably have a few slipups that prevent the easiest playoff path. Still, this team has everything it needs to make a Super Bowl run, especially in a conference where the top teams -- namely the 49ers and Cowboys -- dealt with turmoil off the field this summer. The Packers are young, talented and hungry after nearly getting to the NFC title game last January. My guess: the Packers win 11 regular season games and two playoff games but come up just short of a Super Bowl appearance. Brandon Carwile, contributor 10-7: I expect the offense to get off to a faster start than last year. Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks, Luke Musgrave, and Tucker Kraft are no longer rookies, and with a year of experience, they should be much more comfortable heading into their second seasons. If Christian Watson has truly moved past his hamstring issues, Green Bay's top deep threat should be on the field a lot more. Jordan Love's chemistry with Romeo Doubs is evident, and adding Josh Jacobs to the backfield provides another dynamic weapon. Altogether, these pieces surrounding an emerging quarterback could form a top-10 offense. Most of the question marks lie on defense, where new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley will implement an entirely new scheme in 2024 featuring more aggressive coverages. Like the offense last year, it might take some time for the defense to adjust. Despite that, this team is as well-rounded as it has been in years and should make the playoffs. A tougher schedule may prevent them from dethroning the defending NFC North champion Detroit Lions, but this Packers team is capable of a deep playoff run if everything clicks. Brennen Rupp, contributor 13-4: I'm all in on Jordan Love and this young offense. This offense took off when Aaron Jones got healthy and finished the season on a terror with five straight 100-yard rushing games, including two in the playoffs. Josh Jacobs is going to step into that role and flourish. Jacobs is not far removed from the season he led the league in rushing yards and he's a make-you-miss running back. The year Jacobs led the league in rushing he forced 90 missed tackles and racked up over 1,000 yards after contact. With a year of working together, it's reasonable to expect Love and his group of young pass catchers to continue to put up gaudy numbers. Jeff Hafley takes over a defense that has plenty of talent. I expect Rashan Gary to have a 10-plus sack season, while Kenny Clark enjoys maybe the best season of his career. If Eric Stokes can stay healthy and rediscover his rookie form, the Packers could have two lockdown cornerbacks on the boundary. The safety room went from the worst in the league to a position that looks strong on paper with the free agent signing of Xavier McKinney and the additions of Javon Bullard and Evan Williams via the draft. Greg Williams, contributor 12-5: The Green Bay Packers are poised for a deep run in 2024, building on last year’s playoff victory over the Dallas Cowboys and a strong offseason. With key players returning to full health and impactful additions, the team is prepared to elevate its performance on both sides of the ball. The addition of Josh Jacobs gives the offense a powerful, dynamic rushing attack, while Xavier McKinney brings leadership and playmaking ability to a secondary anchored by a healthy Jaire Alexander. The defense, now under the guidance of new coordinator Jeff Hafley, may have a slow start, but it has the potential to quickly find its rhythm and become a dominant force as the season progresses. While the Packers are well-equipped to contend, they are fully aware of the challenges ahead. They face one of the tougher schedules in the league, with high-stakes matchups against top teams, and they’ll need to navigate an improved NFC North, where the Detroit Lions and Chicago Bears are intriguing teams to watch. Nevertheless, with Jordan Love continuing to develop and the roster now more balanced than ever, the Packers are setting their sights on a 12-5 finish, ready to make a deep playoff push and compete for the Super Bowl.",

    "title": "US policy on frozen Russian assets viewed as ‘theft’",
    "text": "On October 23, 2024, President Joe Biden’s announcement of a significant financial maneuver sent shockwaves through the geopolitical landscape. The United States would leverage frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a $20 billion loan, part of a broader $50 billion support package orchestrated by the G7 nations. This decision has not only stirred a fierce backlash from Moscow but has also sparked a broader debate on international law, sovereignty, and the evolving nature of financial warfare. In his announcement , President Biden characterized this initiative as a “historic decision to leverage Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine.” By pledging to utilize these blocked assets, the Biden administration framed this financial maneuver as a way to provide substantial support without placing an additional burden on US taxpayers. This rhetoric of leveraging foreign assets to fund military and humanitarian efforts presents a compelling narrative, appealing to both domestic and international audiences. However, this announcement follows a series of similar pledges from Western allies. The European Union and the United Kingdom have also indicated their intentions to use Russian funds to support Ukraine, marking a coordinated strategy among Western nations to apply economic pressure on Moscow. Yet, these financial commitments raise serious ethical and legal questions about the treatment of sovereign assets and the implications for international relations. In immediate response to Biden’s declaration, the Russian Embassy in the United States issued a scathing critique, labeling the move as a blatant act of “theft.” This condemnation is rooted in a broader Russian narrative that positions Western actions as imperialistic and neocolonial. The embassy’s statement emphasized the unprecedented nature of the US policy, suggesting that the act of leveraging frozen sovereign assets represents a dangerous escalation of state-sponsored financial warfare. The use of terms like “historic” in Biden’s announcement did not go unnoticed by Russian officials, who argue that it reflects a troubling new precedent in international financial practices. According to the Russian diplomatic mission, these measures, which they claim are often rejected in the international arena, have sparked widespread condemnation from various global actors. The decision to utilize frozen Russian assets is emblematic of a broader trend in international relations, where financial instruments are increasingly weaponized as tools of geopolitical strategy. Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Western nations have imposed sanctions that have frozen an estimated $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, effectively seizing control of these funds within various financial institutions. This unprecedented use of economic sanctions as a geopolitical strategy has raised concerns about the potential ramifications for the global financial system. Although the Biden administration argues that leveraging these assets is a way to support Ukraine without burdening US taxpayers, critics assert that this approach undermines the principles of sovereign immunity and international law. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed reservations about fully confiscating Russian funds, citing fears that such a move could jeopardize global trust in the Western financial system. These concerns underscore the delicate balance that Western governments must maintain as they seek to pressure Russia while avoiding potential backlash that could destabilize international financial relations. The ramifications of leveraging frozen assets extend beyond US-Russian relations. Critics of this policy argue that it sets a dangerous precedent in international law, wherein sovereign assets can be treated as collateral for geopolitical objectives. Legal experts warn that such a move could fundamentally undermine the principle of sovereign immunity, which has long been a cornerstone of international relations. As nations observe the unfolding situation, there is growing apprehension regarding the normalization of asset seizures for political ends. The ramifications are not limited to Russia; other countries could see this as a justification for similar actions against perceived adversaries. The principle that no sovereign state is immune from having its assets appropriated could create a destabilizing precedent, leading to an erosion of trust in international financial systems. In light of these developments, the BRICS nations-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa-have voiced their disapproval of the US policy. During a recent summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS leaders condemned what they termed “illegal sanctions” and highlighted the damaging effects of such measures on the global economy and trade. The Kazan Declaration explicitly called for the elimination of unilateral coercive measures that violate the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and undermine the UN Charter. The summit underscored the need for a more robust multilateral financial architecture that would protect sovereign assets from unilateral actions by dominant global powers. This call for reform reflects a growing desire among emerging economies to create a financial system that is insulated from the whims of Western nations, which they perceive as engaging in neocolonial practices. As the US moves forward with its policy of leveraging frozen Russian assets, it faces a complex landscape of international opinion and legal considerations. The potential consequences of this approach extend beyond immediate financial gains; they may reshape global perceptions of the US and its commitment to the rule of law. Moreover, the Biden administration’s decision raises critical questions about the long-term sustainability of such a strategy. If the US establishes a precedent for leveraging sovereign assets, other nations may adopt similar practices, potentially leading to a cascade of retaliatory measures that could destabilize the global economy. The prospect of a tit-for-tat scenario looms large, where nations might seize assets from countries they perceive as hostile, thus further entrenching divisions in the international system. President Biden’s announcement to leverage frozen Russian assets for Ukraine represents a pivotal moment in international relations, reflecting a significant shift toward using economic tools as instruments of foreign policy. While the intent may be to bolster a key ally in its struggle against aggression, the implications of this strategy are profound and far-reaching. Accusations of state-sponsored theft from Russia, coupled with concerns about undermining international law, highlight the complexities of this new financial warfare. As the global community observes this evolving situation, the US must navigate its actions with caution. The stakes are high, and the potential fallout from this policy could redefine the norms that govern international relations for years to come. Ultimately, the challenge lies in balancing the imperative to support Ukraine while upholding the principles of sovereignty and legality that have long underpinned the international system. The future of US foreign policy may depend on the successful navigation of this intricate landscape, one fraught with risks and opportunities alike.",

    "text": "Delegada Martínez responde a críticas de Chomalí por antiguo tuiteo donde alude a quema de iglesias\nLa delegada presidencial metropolitana, Constanza Martínez, le respondió al arzobispo de Santiago, cardenal Fernando Chomalí, a propósito de una antiguo comentario a través de la red social X (exTwitter).\nSe trata de un tuiteo de marzo de 2018, cuando Martínez era asesora del diputado de Convergencia Social, Gonzalo Winter, cuando escribió: “Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet #TC #lucro”.\nEl comentario de Martínez fue respondido por Chomalí el pasado lunes 25 de diciembre, señalando escuetamente “Dios la bendiga, Constanza”.\nPero además, a través de una carta al Director publicada en El Mercurio, el arzobispo de Santiago defendió su tuiteo, en una misiva titulada “Construir en vez de quemar”.\n“Este mensaje, aunque haya sido escrito hace cinco años, sigue en las redes e incita al odio, ofende a los católicos y a quienes ven en la experiencia religiosa un bien para la sociedad”, criticó.\n“Como chileno y como arzobispo rechazo categóricamente comentarios de esa índole, que no se dicen ni en broma. Más aún cuando la quema de tantos templos, sobre todo en el sur de Chile, han reportado un gran sufrimiento a la comunidad en general por ser lugares de culto, de encuentro comunitario y de paz”, enfatizó Chomalí.\nPor último, junto con estimar que “este tipo de escritos que no contribuyen en nada a construir una cultura del encuentro”, invitó a Martínez a conocer la labor social que realiza la Iglesia, asegurando que “estoy seguro de que en vez de querer quemarlas las va a querer cuidar y promover”.\nConsultada por las críticas de Chomalí durante una actividad realizada la mañana de este viernes, la delegada Martínez reiteró la explicación que dio cuando asumió su cargo, cuando el tuiteo fue reflotado en marzo de 2022.\n“Este es un tuit bien antiguo de hace cinco años, lo había hablado cuando asumí el cargo hace más de dos años. Hace alusión a una canción de un artista nacional que se llama Álex Anwandter, de una canción que se llama Siempre es viernes en mi corazón, que recomiendo mucho que la escuchen”, explicó.\n“Es una canción que tiene una crítica importante a la política, al Congreso y también a las instituciones eclesiásticas respecto al trato que se le ha dado a la población homosexual y de las disidencias sexuales”, añadió Martínez.\nEn ese sentido, explicó que el tuiteo lo escribió a propósito de la decisión del Tribunal Constitucional de declarar inconstitucional la ley que prohibía el lucro en las universidades y en la educación en general.\n“Si ustedes revisan mi experiencia política, lo que he hecho en estos dos años, pero también lo que he hecho en mi experiencia política como dirigente estudiantil, es siempre velar por las manifestaciones pacíficas”, se defendió.\n“He demostrado que no creo en el camino de la violencia y además tengo un profundo respeto por todas las creencias. Vengo de un ambiente que también es de mucho respeto a las distintas creencias y que creo que mis hechos ya han dado cuenta de eso”, agregó.\n“Un tuit respecto a una canción me parece que no representa lo que he hecho ni lo que soy”, concluyó la delegada presidencial Constanza Martínez.",

    "text": "Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\nMay 25, 2024\nOlua festival is a very sacred and peculiar festival in Otan-Ayegbaju community, headquarters of Boluwaduro local government area of Osun State. However, the yearly turns bloody, reports TOBA ADEDEJI\nOtan-Ayegbaju is wildly known for its yearly festival called Olua or Oroke as the priest called Aworo Olua will lead the procession of the people of the community including the chiefs and the king to different spots where rites will be made to the gods including the forebears of the three ruling.\nAccording to tradition, the Olua festival came to existence after the first king of the town turned himself to be the god of the community, but before his transmogrification, he assigned duties on how sacrifices would be made to him.\nHe assigned duties on how libation of palm wine will be poured, how meat would be provided and how divination Kola nut would be made during the yearly sacrifice.\nFor the festival, participants, indigenes and members of the three ruling houses will wear intricately colored dresses as others will wear white. Traditional rhythmic drum and music will spice up the joyful atmosphere of the town which terrain consists of hills, mountains, dense forest, vegetation and gullies.\nHowever, the 2024 festival of Oroke or Olua experienced conflict which made the celebration go awry for some sections of the community.\nThe Nation learnt that crisis started when the head of Elemu ruling house whose duty was to pick date for the festival informed Aworo-Olua who later informed the king. However, the king, Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe, had reservations for the said date because he claimed that it will clash with the activities of other religions.\nIt was gathered that the Head of Elemu proposed May 23rd and 24th 2024 but the king made adjustment to 22nd and 23rd which the priest for the festival, Aworo-Olau agreed to.\nThe festival held on 22nd and 23rd led by the king and Aworo-Olua, Chief James Egunfemi. But other ruling houses who ought to be part of festival kicked against the date.\nThe Elemu and other ruling houses held another Olua Festival on Thursday on the ground that according to the tradition, it must be held on the market day of the community which the king failed to consider while making date adjustment.\nIt was learnt that while the other section of the community were holding the Olua Festival according to the edict of the tradition, they were attacked by thugs which led to scores injured.\nA source in the community Shina said: “There were gunshots during the attack on Thursday during the Olua Festival. Many people were hack by the thugs. I learnt that those thugs were brought into the town by one of the chiefs who was not pleased with the ruling houses conducting another Olua festival after the one that Kabiyesi and Aworo-Olua championed a day before. They felt it is sacrilegious to hold two Olua Festivals in within one year.”\nOne of the injured adherents Tosin Akintunde explained how he and seven of his friends were attacked and injured severely.\nAccording to him: “We were at the Olua’s forest on Thursday when I was hacked by thugs. I was equally stabbed to the extent on my chest. I nearly bleed to death. About seven of us were taken to hospital for treatment while others were detained in police station. They claimed that what we are doing is a taboo. They are wrong, we are right.”\nSpokesperson of Elemu and Onigbo Ruling Houses, Prince Tunde Adeleke explained that it is the duty of the head of Elemu ruling house to pick date for Olua festival and he would communicate it to Aworo for the king to prepare.\nRelated Posts His word: “However, the king and Aworo connived with each other to adjust the date to an earlier date which is a taboo. The festival must be held on the market day of our community.”\nHe added:“it is an abomination for us to join the festival on the day they fixed, so we observed that festival on the date fixed the Elemu which was a day after the theirs.”\nAdeleke alleged that Aworo-Olua led thug to the forest where they were holding the festival to attack worshippers and adherents, saying, “one of our people was shot and was nearly killed while other were severely injured. Police also arrived at the scene to make arrest. They arrested Chief Elemu, Jerome Omotoso, Chief Onigbo, George Adeyemi and Rodiat Kazeem at the Olua Forest. These people arrested were above 80-year-old.”\nHe alleged that policemen took side against them which made them to detained the chiefs for about two days before they were released.\n“The Osun State Government must quickly intervene before it snowball into major crisis. The actions of the king and the priest are sacrilegious which have great consequences on the town if the needful is not done on time.”\nHowever, Aworo-Olua, Chief Egunfemi denied involvement in mobilizing thugs to the other Olua Festival conducted by Elemu ruling house.\nHe said, “I stand for peace and want peace to reign in our community. The law is above everybody, there shouldn’t be crisis. The history of Otan-Ayegbaju is not complete without Olua festival because it need to do with the origin of the community.”\nHe explained’ “Any reigning Oba in any community in Yoruba land is the chief custodian of the tradition and culture and has total prerogative which can’t be challenged. The Kabiyesi has the right on whatsoever that goes on in his domain, he made appeal that he want Friday and Sunday which for other religion to be respected to avoid inter-religious crisis. I believe any reasonable person should agree with him. So we all agreed 22nd and 23rd May 2024 but the other section felt it is not pleasing to them, then they went to organised theirs.”\nOba Fadipe alleged that the Elemu and Onigbo houses are the one fanning the ember of discord in the town by holding separate festival which is a taboo to the culture.\nAccording to him: “I am in charge of the custom and tradition in this community. Aworo is the priest who should led the festival joined by me. It is unfortunate that those people gathered themselves to cause conflict in the town. I adjusted the day because I don’t want it to clash with other religious activities. One of the two days they shifted it to fall on Friday.\n“Those involved are miscreants. Their action is sacrilegious because they entered the front through a route that tradition stated it that we should exit. This has grave consequences on the town. I am in charge of the community and any other person who want to object to my command and the verdict will be dealt with by law of the land.”\n“We only reported them to the police who arrested them, we do not do take laws into our hands, security operatives are involved in our own festival. Any other festival without my permission is illegality and a taboo to the tradition of the land.”\nOsun Police spokesperson Yemisi Opalola promised to get back to The Nation when contacted over the incident.",
