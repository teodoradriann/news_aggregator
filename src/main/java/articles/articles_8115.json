    "text": "马来西亚国家足球队上周公布备战2027年亚洲杯入选赛的球队名单，费沙哈林名列其中，这是他自10个月前遭到恶徒以酸液袭击后首次入选国家队，他伤愈后重返赛场、再次进球到回归国足，过程实在振奋人心。\n目前在国内引起热捧的中国动画片《哪吒2》当中有一句励志台词：“我命由我不由天”。哪吒逆天改命的毅力被视为大家学习的榜样，而费沙哈林正是活生生的例子。\n他是“登嘉楼梅西”\n费沙的身高只有158公分，从小就被认为不适合当足球员，更别说要与强壮后卫对抗的前锋。但他却不认命，克服了先天身体条件的不足，凭借不懈的努力踢出名堂，出道时还获得“登嘉楼梅西”的美誉。随后费沙被征召到国家队，几乎场场都进球，很快就成为球队主力和球迷的偶像。\n所谓是金子总会发光，费沙在去年初的亚洲杯比赛，大马3比3战平韩国的经典战中攻入一个精彩的进球，获选为该届亚洲杯最佳进球。这名小个子的名声也迅速响遍亚洲，身材矮小的他却能够成为亚洲一流的职业球员，给了许多人非常大的鼓励。\n创伤挥之不去\n然而，就在事业如日中天之际，费沙却在去年5月5日遭到酸液恶意袭击，事件震惊国际足坛。费沙经过多次手术治疗后，6月中旬，我采访费沙遇袭后首次公开亮相的新闻发布会，他的伤势让在场所有人触目惊心，其不幸遭遇无不让人心痛和不值。\n这样的袭击，让他身心上都遭受严重的创伤，未来充满着许多不确定性。即使身体上的伤势能够复原，但心灵上的创伤恐怕会永远挥之不去，他又能否恢复以往的状态？甚至让人担忧会就此结束球员生涯。\n但费沙再次展现出“我命由我不由天”的坚强态度，他在遇袭后3个月就重返赛场。直到今年3月初的马超联赛，费沙自伤愈首次进球就攻入3球上演帽子戏法，象征正式找回昔日风采，被重新召入国足也是顺理成章。\n3月25日在新山苏丹依布拉欣体育场，大马对尼泊尔的亚洲杯入选赛。如果费沙能够被派上阵，不仅见证他回归国足，世人也将见证一名排除万难的生命斗士。\n五大联赛最新赛果：英超、意甲、西甲、德甲、法甲，实时更新，精彩不容错过！",

    "text": "The agreement was signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and a 29-member delegation of the ULFA's pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 23:07 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 23:07 IST - Country: - India In a significant milestone, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)'s pro-talks faction on Friday signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and the Assam government on Friday agreeing to vacate all camps occupied by its armed cadres, engage in the peaceful democratic process established by law and maintain the integrity of the country. The agreement was signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and a 29-member delegation of the ULFA's pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society. Shah termed the pact a \"golden day for Assam\" at a time when peace was going to be established in Northeast and Assam, which have been bearing the brunt of violence for a long time. The Home Minister asserted on the occasion that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will fully implement every aspect of the agreement and act accordingly.\" After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Shah said there has been an 87 per cent decrease in violent incidents in Assam, a 90 per cent decrease in deaths, an 84 per cent decrease in abductions, and so far, more than 7,500 militants have surrendered, with 750 joining today. \"This way, the surrender by more than 8,200 militants in Assam alone marks the dawn of a new era of peace for Assam.\" He said that after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014, efforts were made to bridge the gap between Delhi and Northeast and talks with everyone started with an open mind. The Home Minister said under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the Ministry of Home Affairs worked with the vision of a Northeast, free from extremism, violence and conflict. He said that in the last five years, nine peace and border-related agreements have been signed with different states in the Northeast, and these have established peace in a large part of the Northeast. The Minister said that on record more than 9,000 cadres have surrendered and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been lifted from 85 per cent area of Assam. He said that due to the tripartite agreement being signed today between the Government of India, the Government of Assam and ULFA, the Modi government has achieved success in eliminating all the violent groups in Assam. The Minister said that today's agreement is very important for peace in Assam and the entire Northeast, pointing \"in today's agreement, ULFA representatives have agreed to abjure the path of violence, lay down all their arms and ammunition and disband their armed organisation.\" Apart from this, Shah said ULFA has also agreed to vacate all camps occupied by its armed cadres, engage in the peaceful democratic process established by law and maintain the integrity of the country. He also mentioned that about 10,000 people from both sides were killed in the ULFA conflict, who were citizens of this country, but this problem is being completely resolved today. The Minister said that the government of India has agreed to provide a huge package and several big projects for the all-round development of Assam and that the Modi government will \"comply with all provisions of the agreement.\" The Union Home Minister said that the Modi government has signed the NLFT agreement in 2019, Bru and Bodo in 2020, Karbi in 2021, the Adivasi agreement in 2022, the Assam-Meghalaya border agreement, Assam-Arunachal border agreement and agreement with UNLF in 2023 and today, with ULFA. He said that with this agreement today, a new era of peace is going to begin for the entire Northeast, especially Assam. Shah said that \"a time-bound program will be made by the Ministry of Home Affairs to fulfil the demands of ULFA and a committee will also be formed for its monitoring. He also mentioned that in all the agreements signed after 2019, the Modi government is ahead of time and efforts have been made to fulfil all the conditions. The separatist ULFA was formed in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan). It split into two groups in February 2011 with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction giving up violence and agreeing to unconditional talks with the government. Paresh Baruah, who leads the other rebranded ULFA-Independent faction, is against the talks. The pro-talks faction has sought constitutional and political reforms for the protection of the identity and resources of Assam's indigenous people including their right to land. The Union government in April sent it a draft agreement. An earlier round of talks between the two sides was held in Delhi in August.

However, the tour was “very impressive and interesting” for the women.\nThe next destination was Winterthur, where they received instructions for “urban golf” at the tourist office. Equipped with golf clubs, balls and brushes, the women left the station building towards their accommodation in the train depot.\nAfter checking into their rooms and having a snack on the terrace of the depot, five groups of four to five women tackled the golf course starting in the Sulzer area. From the Sulzer area they went up towards Frohbergpark, past the rose garden to Büelrainpark. Everyone had a lot of fun, hitting the balls from the cobblestones into the trash cans, playing eagerly\nWe walked back to the depot. We rounded off the first day with a convivial dinner and a subsequent walk through Winterthur’s old town.\nAwakened by bats In the morning, bats woke the women from their sleep and after breakfast they marched to Winterthur train station. From there they continued to Dietikon, then took the bus to Geroldswil, where they leisurely climbed the Altberg.\nAfter more than half of the women had climbed the observation tower and were back on solid ground, there were plenty of drinks and potato salad with sausages in the Waldschenke. An espresso, house coffee or coffee Baileys rounded off the culinary offering and, strengthened, the women tackled the descent towards Weiningen.\nAfter marching more than eleven kilometers every day and taking in many new impressions around Zurich Airport, they reached Herisau train station as planned in the early evening.",

    "text": "A member of Israel’s war cabinet warned on Wednesday that the diplomatic “hourglass” was running out for Lebanon as the nation has failed to stop Hezbollah from firing rockets across the border.\nIsraeli government minister Benny Gantz derided the barrage from the Lebanese border — raising new fears of a second front of the war opening on Israel’s northern border.\n“The hourglass for a political settlement is running out,” Gantz told reporters.\n“If the world and Lebanon’s government will not work to stop the shooting at Israel and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will do so.”\nHezbollah, a heavily militarized terrorist organization, holds a strong grip over southern Lebanon and began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack.\nAt least 11 Israelis, including four civilians, have been killed by the strikes.\nAround 150 Lebanese — mostly Hezbollah terrorists and 17 civilians — have been killed by Israeli counterstrikes. Thousands of civilians have been displaced on both sides of the border.\n3\nHezbollah praised Hamas’ attack on Israel and vowed to join them in war shortly after October 7 REUTERS\nGantz’s warning came after Hezbollah launched its most expansive assault yet on Wednesday, firing more rockets and drones at Israel than in any other single day since the assaults began.\nFor weeks, Israeli officials have been working diplomatic channels with Lebanon to have Hezbollah removed from the border region. Officials from the US and France have been dispatched to Beirut to assuage the tense standoff.\nThe diplomats have not had success.\n“We are turning to every normal country, be it the United States, France, Arab countries – anyone who could somehow influence the situation and has some influence in Lebanon,” Yuli Edelstein, chairman of Israel’s parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said earlier in December.\nEdelstein cautioned that failure in diplomacy could lead to a second front in the ongoing war.\n3\nIsraeli rocket launchers were stationed at the northern border and poised to strike back at Hezbollah on Wednesday AFP via Getty Images\nThe head of the IDF, Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen Herzi Halevi, echoed Gantz’s position this week, saying troops stationed in northern Israel were on “very high readiness.”\n“Our first task is to restore security and the sense of security to the residents in the north, and this will take time,” he said, according to the BBC.\nHezbollah has praised Hamas’ brutal October 7 terror attack on Israel — which resulted in 1,500 largely civilian deaths and another 240 taken hostage. The Iranian terror proxy has been threatening to join the war ever since.\nJust days after the attack, high-ranking Hezbollah Deputy Chief Naim Qassem said the group was “fully prepared” to join ranks with Hamas. Qassem described the move as a “duty” during an October rally where attendees chanted “Death to Israel.”\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah is one of several Middle East extremist groups funded by Iran that refer to themselves as the “Axis of Resistance.”\n3\nDestruction in the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil after Israeli rockets struck on Tuesday, killing three civilians Xinhua/Shutterstock\nAnother member of the group, the Houthis in Yemen, are dedicated to the destruction of both the US and Israel and have critically disrupted Mediterranean commerce by attacking freighters passing through the Red Sea.\nThe efforts of the Axis appear to be a part of a wider Iranian campaign to eradicate Western influence from the Middle East, experts have cautioned, and have left the US and allies tiptoeing around the region to avoid sparking open conflict with Iran.\nPresident Biden went so far as to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt plans for a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah shortly after the October 7 attack, according to reports.\nNevertheless, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made its attitude towards Hezbollah perfectly clear.\nDuring a visit to the northern border earlier this month, Netanyahu said Israel was ready to “single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza.”",

Las acusaciones incluyen abuso sexual con acceso carnal y haber causado un grave daño en la salud mental de la víctima, quien fue su pareja. El sorteo de los tribunales realizado el 15 de abril determinó que sea este tribunal el encargado del proceso, luego de que la Cámara de Apelaciones rechazara la apelación de Contardi ante el pedido del Juzgado N°3 de Garantías. El Tribunal estará integrado por los jueces Daniel Rópolo, Federico Matinengo y un magistrado designado por la Cámara de Apelaciones. Aún no se estableció una fecha para el inicio del juicio. El ex de Julieta Prandi, a juicio: el informe clave El expediente del caso cuenta con un informe clave realizado por el reconocido perito psiquiatra Rafael Herrera Milano, quien asistió a Julieta Prandi como paciente. Herrera Milano constató los daños psicológicos en Prandi como consecuencia del padecimiento que habría atravesado durante la relación. En el informe, el médico indica que Prandi presentaba “acentuados síntomas de angustia, ansiedad y labilidad emocional”. Herrera Milano concluyó “a lo largo de las entrevistas se han observado indicadores inequívocos de haber padecido situaciones de estrés crónico, compatibles con hostigamiento sexual y violencia familiar sostenidas en el tiempo, destacando un daño lacerante en su autoestima”.
