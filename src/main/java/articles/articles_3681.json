    "text": "Renato Centeio Piet Raijmakers é escolhido como o novo treinador de salto do Brasil\nO Brasil acertou com um novo treinador para o time de salto. O nome escolhido foi o holandês Piet Raijmakers, que foi anunciado na última quarta-feira (22), por Constantino Scampini, presidente da Confederação Brasileira de Hipismo (CBH).\nRaijmakers é um nome consagrado no hipismo, já que conquistou o Ouro na categoria de saltos por equipes e a Prata na categoria individual de saltos nas Olimpíadas de 1992, em Barcelona. Ele chega com papel importante na formação de novos talentos e novos cavalos neste ciclo de preparação ao menos até a próxima edição das Olimpíadas, que será realizada em 2028, em Los Angeles.\n“Piet é um cavaleiro de excepcionais condições, muito prestigiado internacionalmente. Conseguimos trazê-lo para tentar levar o Brasil a pelo menos três medalhas: no Mundial, Pan-americano e Olimpíadas. “Esse também é o projeto do Piet. Vamos naturalmente tentar, vamos precisar somente de atletas e cavalos agora. A vontade e o treinador a gente têm”, acrescentou o dirigente que assumiu a CBH no início de 2025”, disse Constantino Scampini, em coletiva.\nDaniel Khury, vice-presidente da CBH e diretor de salto, também falou um pouco sobre a negociação que selou a chegada do novo treinador.\n“Ele veio ao Brasil para conversar e acabamos fechando essa contratação. Durante as nossas conversas, eu fiz algumas abordagens referente à maneira que gostaríamos de trabalhar, não somente com a equipe principal, mas também dando muita atenção aos nossos cavaleiros Senior Top em atividade no Brasil, para que a gente tivesse um estreitamento dessa distância entre a Europa e o Brasil”, explicou o VP.\nPor fim, o holandês também comentou sobre o seu conhecimento em hipismo brasileiro, como enxerga o potencial dos cavaleiros e cavalos do Brasil e uma breve ideia de sua filosofia de trabalho.\n“Conheço 80% dos cavaleiros brasileiros que estão na Europa e América. O Brasil é um país dos cavalos: têm cavalos muito bons e cavaleiros muito bons. Agora temos que fazer um plano para chegar no auge no dia certo, com a equipe e também na disputa individual. E só tem um caminho para atingir isso: com trabalho duro, cavaleiros e cavalos em forma e fazer um bom plano. Não exijam demais de seus cavalos. Há um tempo certo para cada conjunto. Esse é o plano, mais do que isso até agora eu não tenho, sou treinador há poucas horas”, disse Raijmakers.\ncolaborou: Guilherme Cunha",

    "title": "Active Transportation Plan could bring nearly 200km of new routes, trails to Aurora",
    "text": "Aurora’s new Active Transportation Master Plan could bring nearly 200km of new routes to the municipal trails system. The draft Master Plan was presented to Council last week at the Town’s first Committee of the Whole meeting on March 5. The Plan is intended to guide the development of active transportation networks – such as trails and bike lanes – for the next 20 years. The Master Plan has been in the works since 2021 with consultants WSP Canada and has been guided by six key pillars: Provide and Support a Variety of Transportation Options; Support Community Health; Improve Connectivity; Increase Sustainability; Prioritize Safety and Accessibility; and Coordinate with Existing and Future Infrastructure Projects. The draft plan also looked at socio-economic trends to help “develop an understanding” of the current and future needs of Aurora residents. “Approximately 60 per cent of Aurora’s population commuted to work, with 22 per cent spending under 15 minutes and 21 per cent spending 15 to 29 minutes on their commute,” the report found, citing the most recent data from Statistics Canada. “Despite the relatively short commute times, the majority of Aurora residents (87 per cent) use driving as their main form of transportation during the week. This is followed by transit use, including GO Rail, local transit, and school buses, at 7 per cent. Active transportation, such as walking and cycling, accounts for approximately 5 per cent of the overall transportation mode share in Aurora.” In consultation with Aurora residents, consultants say community members identified “challenges” within the existing active transportation network which affect how often residents use them, including “lack of a connected cycling and trail network, concerns about high speed and noise from vehicle traffic, poor conditions of some existing sidewalks and trails, [and] connections to key Town destinations” such as the GO Station. “A key task of the Active Transportation Master Plan (ATMP) was to develop a proposed active transportation network for Aurora that was…designed with an equitable lens to ensure that underserved communities will have optimal access to the network. Along with equity and connectivity considerations, the proposed network is intended to be universally accessible to people of all ages and abilities,” they said. “In total, the Town of Aurora’s recommended active transportation and trails network is made up of almost 490 km or routes. Approximately 300 km is existing and this ATMP proposes about 190 km of new routes. “To create a culture of walking, cycling and micro-mobility use in the Town of Aurora, financial investment and other resources need to be strategically allocated. The ATMP outlines phasing and maintenance strategies that are intended to guide decision-making on active transportation policy and planning processes while being flexible enough to adapt to changes in active transportation trends or other opportunities that may arise over the years as the network is being implemented.” Short term goals – those that can be accomplished within ten years of the plan’s adoption – include “quick wins” of signed bike routes, “conventional or buffered” bike lanes, physically separated facilities along roadways, the further development of sidewalks and the implementation of “road diets” to facilitate traffic flow. A road diet in this context is a reduction of lanes for through traffic to allow bike infrastructure and on-street parking – particularly on Yonge Street and the Aurora Promenade area in the Town’s historic downtown core. Consultants said this would allow for further turn lanes that would “really benefit businesses in terms of access to and from those properties compared to the current condition,” but said doing so at Orchard Heights would require “significant design modifications.” “The concept has been talked about for many years now,” said Ward 4 Councillor Michael Thompson. “In the past when I have raised the concern, I am looking for more evidence, more details to corroborate that this is the right thing for us to do in our downtown core. “When I go online and just search myself to understand road diets and implementation in other communities, there is certainly a lot of positive results and information available for anybody who wants to do some research… but there are also come cases where it didn’t work out and they’ve had to reverse it or it has created other issues. I am a little concerned when I see it being identified as a quick win to implement that program; I don’t know if collectively we have done enough due diligence to support the idea and make all of Council and myself fully aware of not just the benefits but also any potential risks.” Another concern voiced at the table came from Ward 1 Councillor Ron Weese who questioned how Metrolinx’ plans to add a double track through Aurora on the GO line to allow for all-day, two-way 15-minute train service, and potentially a traffic underpass beneath Wellington Street, would impact plans for grade-separated active transportation infrastructure. “Is there a reason for it being a priority 10 years from now as opposed to somewhere between now and 10 years?” he asked. The consultant replied the priority is to complete a feasibility study to get “a better appreciation of what would be involved to design and implement” some of the grade separations. The Wellington Corridor, agreed Ward 2 Councillor Rachel Gilliland, was a “sticking point” and the current configuration of the rails bisecting Aurora was a “great divide” that is an ongoing challenge. Now is the time to advocate for Aurora’s priorities and send a message that more infrastructure is needed for east-west connectivity. “[Metrolinx] will be double tracking and that will then guide York Region in what they can do from that point on to provide pathway connections to the GO Station to both east and west of Yonge Street and beyond Yonge Street to Bathurst,” said the consultant. Added Councillor Gilliland: “I understand there are a lot of challenges between Yonge and the GO because it is very narrow, but at the very least, especially with the development that will occur down that local corridor, it (traffic) is only going to increase. I have families who say they can’t walk strollers, there is nowhere to go. It is a challenge, so I would just prefer to highlight that as I feel, for Aurora, it is a priority to be able to connect east and west.”",

    "text": "Conservationists in Cambodia have found 106 eggs of the rare Siamese crocodile species in a western Cambodian wildlife sanctuary, officials said.\nThe discovery has been called the biggest in the last 20 years, giving new hope for the world’s rarest crocodile species’ survival in the wild.\nThe group discovered the species eggs in Cardamom National Park in May.\nBetween June 27 and 30, a total of 60 eggs were successfully hatched, according to a joint statement issued by the ministries of agriculture and environment together with the conservation group Fauna & Flora.\n“This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species recovery,” the statement said.\nThe location and the young reptiles had been under the protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary rangers, it added.\nThe crocodile species was once widespread across Southeast Asia but is now listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\nIt had all but disappeared by the 1990s due to a combination of poaching, habitat destruction and crossbreeding with other crocodile species.\nCambodian environment minister Eang Sophalleth said his ministry was working on the conservation and habitat restoration of these critically endangered Siamese crocodiles.\n“The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the ecosystem, and the discovery of the five nets successfully hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is a safe and suitable habitat for this species,” Mr Sophalleth said in Thursday’s statement.\nIt is believed that about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in the wild, with more than 300 of them in Cambodia.\nIn 2017, wildlife researchers found six eggs in Sre Ambel district in the southern province of Koh Kong as they were exploring for tracks and signs of the reptile.\nLater in September 2021, eight hatchlings were found by conservationists in a river in the Srepok wildlife sanctuary in eastern Cambodia which also raised hopes for its survival in the wild.",

    "title": "World's helium supply is running low and disrupting crucial services - Earth.com",
    "text": "Helium has quietly become one of the most indispensable resources of modern life. It’s used in hospital equipment, spacecraft, deep-sea breathing mixtures, electronics manufacturing, and scientific instruments – yet its supplies are notoriously precarious.\nThose precarious supplies nearly derailed the work of Nancy Washton, a chemist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), who oversees instruments that rely on helium to stay cool.\nShe was forced to shut down a crucial nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer in 2022, when her supplier started cutting deliveries.\nHelium’s unique low boiling point, around -452 °F, makes it vital for cooling superconducting magnets found in MRI scanners, nuclear magnetic resonance devices, and other sensitive equipment.\nIts inert nature ensures it doesn’t react with other chemicals. Since it’s also very light, it’s used to fill balloons for meteorological measurements and essential airbags in cars.\nThis gas is so lightweight that it can leak into space over time, making it impossible to recapture once it’s gone. Existing supply lines rely on drilling deep into Earth’s crust, where radioactive decay gradually produces helium.\nProducers separate helium from natural gas streams before shipping it off to meet scientific, medical, and industrial demand.\n“We are now living on the banked liquid helium that the vendors had,” said Washton, who also noted the price at one point reached $55 per liter to cool a magnet. Researchers around the world, including teams using NMR spectrometers, have felt the pinch.\nThis forced her to mothball some of PNNL’s superconducting instruments, disrupting important energy research.\nOthers have installed expensive recovery systems that can recollect much of the boiled-off gas, re-liquefy it, and reuse it. But recovery setups are costly, need careful maintenance, and can require new pipework throughout a lab.\nSmaller institutions often struggle with these expenses, raising concerns that cutting-edge research could suffer while budgets get stretched.\nHospitals use more helium than any other sector, about one-third of the global market. The gas cools powerful magnets in MRI scanners. If supply lines falter, scans may be delayed or canceled.\nSome new MRI models require as little as a single liter of helium, using sealed units that recirculate the gas.\nThese machines often cost more and produce slightly lower magnetic field strengths, yet they offer hope for reducing helium demand.\nAnalysts expect global helium demand to double by 2035 because of its role in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing.\nDespite this, no large-scale artificial method exists to produce helium. It is created naturally in our planet’s crust at a slow rate, and it continually drifts out of the atmosphere.\nSupply disruptions are common, fueled by events like maintenance shutdowns at processing plants and geopolitical conflicts.\nQatar, Algeria, and the United States remain key suppliers, but mishaps and trade sanctions can put deliveries in jeopardy.\nMajor natural gas exporters hope to tap additional helium reserves. Tanzania’s recent discovery of a large helium field is slated to begin production in 2025, marking the first time helium will be extracted at scale without relying on fossil fuels.\nQatar also plans to bring a new helium plant online by 2027. These projects could help ease market jitters.\nYet some experts, including Oxford’s Christopher Ballentine, warn that the logistics and financing for these fields may take years to materialize.\nOver the years, governments have tried to manage helium by maintaining strategic stockpiles. The U.S. Federal Helium Reserve, once the planet’s largest source, was sold in 2024 to a private firm.\nConcerned groups such as The Compressed Gas Association cautioned that this sale might bring added uncertainty to an already volatile market. Predicting stable output has grown difficult, and prices have soared accordingly.\n“This is serious and we need to deal with it,” said Washton. She suggests that ordinary people could be caught off guard if helium shortages intensify.\nIf future shortages worsen, everything from routine hospital scans to advanced semiconductor production might be impacted.\nStakeholders are cautiously optimistic that new helium fields, smaller MRI machines, and better recycling measures will prevent a dire shortfall.\nBut the gas’s rare qualities mean replacements are tough to find. Efforts are underway to reuse every drop possible, even if that requires pricey equipment and careful planning.\nThe study is published in Physics Today.\n—–\nLike what you read?

    "text": "Hundreds of pro-Hamas agitators shut down the entrance to the World Trade Center, the site of the 9/11 attacks after they gathered in Zuccotti Park for the “Flood NYC for Palestine” protest Thursday evening. This disgraceful event comes just one day after pro-Hamas agitators shut down roads to both Los Angeles International Airport and New York’s JFK Airport, as the Gateway Pundit reported . In one video, the terrorist sympathizers in masks are waving Palestine flags and chanting, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” and “Free Palestine.” These phrases are calls to wipe Israel off the map. WATCH: — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 28, 2023 Other videos captured at the site show them holding signs such as “Genocide Joe Has Got To Go.” Yes, Biden is not anti-Israel enough for these brats’ liking. Police officers are seen guarding the entrance to prevent the protesters from entering. Recall the NYPD played a heroic role in the aftermath of the attacks, even at the cost of deleterious long-term health effects. What could be going through their minds as Americans openly celebrate the actions of radical Islamists? Hundreds of protesters decided to use the World Trade Center. In the same location, the 9/11 attacks took place to stage their protest.

    "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 11:13 AM UTC\nTurkiye: Adverse weather forecast across western regions through at least Jan. 5\nSevere weather forecast across western Turkiye through at least Jan. 5. Flooding and associated disruptions possible.\nSevere weather is forecast across parts of western Turkiye through at least Jan. 5. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are expected across Aydin, Izmir, and Mugla provinces over the coming days; strong wind gusts, lightning, localized hail, and possible tornadoes may accompany storms. Rainfall totals of over 10 cm (4 inches) are possible in parts of Mugla Province through early Jan. 5. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages.\nThe Turkish State Meteorological Service has issued orange thunderstorm warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale) for Mugla Province Jan. 3-4 and yellow thunderstorm warnings for Izmir Province Jan. 3-4 and Aydin Province Jan. 4. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming hours and days.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil.\nAuthorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks.\nFloodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track inundation.\nLocalized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites.\nMonitor local media for updated emergency and weather information. Seek updated information on weather and road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast. Plan accordingly for potential delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Do not attempt to drive through flooded areas. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "text": "O sindicato que representa os pilotos da Portugália decidiu renovar a greve a tempo parcial aos voos realizados para a TAP de 28 de março a 11 de abril, disse à Lusa fonte oficial do SIPLA.\nDepois da paralisação de 12 a 27 de março, que contou com uma adesão, em média, de 95% “ou superior” em alguns dias, os associados decidiram avançar com novo pré-aviso de greve entre as 03:00 e as 09:00 de 28 de março a 11 de abril, adiantou o Sindicato Independente de Pilotos de Linhas Aéreas (SIPLA).\nNesta faixa horária, a Portugália realiza 28 a 29 voos para a TAP, mas nestes dias “foram realizados apenas um ou dois”, além da ligação obrigatória entre Lisboa e a Terceira, nos Açores. A mesma fonte oficial faz um balanço “positivo” e revela que têm decorrido várias reuniões com a administração da TAP, muitas por telefone. Porém, como consideram que “continua a não haver garantias de estabilidade”, decidiram renovar a paralisação.\nTAP lamenta greve na Portugália e garante “normalidade”\nLer Mais\n“Tem havido avanços em algumas matérias, mas quando enviam a redação das propostas vêm alteradas” face ao que foi falado nos encontros, e “sem qualquer compromisso concreto que garantisse o futuro dos pilotos da Portugália”, segundo a mesma fonte. “Em apenas um mês, a administração contradisse as próprias afirmações, provando que a única coisa que realmente mudou foi a sua estratégia de desinformação”, lamenta o sindicato.\nO SIPLA revelou ainda que lhes foi transmitido que a TAP iria reduzir a frota da Portugália de 19 para 17 aeronaves, e que não haveria garantias de trabalhadores serem integrados na companhia aérea de bandeira. Apesar de recentemente a Portugália ter transitado da TAP SGPS para a TAP SA, no âmbito da reprivatização da companhia aérea, “nada vai mudar”, lamentou o sindicato, acrescentando que “temem pelo futuro da empresa” que atualmente emprega quase 900 trabalhadores.\nO sindicato informa também que “já avançou com a queixa junto da Autoridade da Concorrência portuguesa” por violação das regras de concorrência no Regulamento do Recurso à Contratação Externa (RRCE), estando a preparar também uma manifestação junto da Direção-Geral da Concorrência Europeia.\nUm dos motivos da insatisfação está precisamente relacionado com o RRCE, criado em 1998, que tinha como objetivo funcionar como um travão à contratação de voos externos pela TAP, incluindo à Portugália que representa a maior fatia, impondo limites que, caso sejam ultrapassados, revertem a favor dos pilotos da TAP através do pagamento de compensações indemnizatórias.\nEste protocolo, usado por várias companhias europeias, originou custos de 60 milhões de euros no ano passado, como resultado do pagamento de seis salários-base extraordinários a cada piloto da TAP, como o Expresso tinha noticiado em maio de 2024. Os pilotos da Portugália, que em 2023 realizou cerca de 25% do total de voos da TAP de acordo com o relatório da TAP SGPS, têm vindo a criticar as consequências deste protocolo e defendem que só reforça que é “considerada uma empresa externa”.\nA direção do SIPLA enviou uma proposta à administração TAP que previa a “substituição das aeronaves atuais, aquisição de novas aeronaves, garantias laborais, proteção na redução de postos de trabalho devido à diminuição de frota , definição de um número mínimo de aeronaves e a admissão de oficiais pilotos da Portugália na TAP por concurso interno”.\nEm respostas à Lusa, em 12 de março, a TAP informou que “na impossibilidade de um consenso que permita evitar um protesto cuja razão de ser é de difícil compreensão, a TAP tomou já todas as medidas possíveis para mitigar o efeito desta greve junto dos passageiros”. Nesse sentido, assegura que a operação iria decorrer com normalidade neste período.",
