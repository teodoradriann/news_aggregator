    "title": "Delhi Faces Double Whammy of Poor AQI and Dropping Temperatures This Weekend | Weather.com",
    "text": "Friday, December 13: Delhiites woke up shivering and surrounded by smog this morning. While unpleasant, these conditions are far from surprising for the national capital given the drop in temperatures throughout the week.\nThe mercury fell to 4.9°C in Delhi earlier this week, marking one of the sharpest cold waves in recent years. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed this to strong northwesterly winds and the absence of significant Western disturbances, which are expected to keep temperatures between 4°C and 6°C for the coming days.\nFurther, coldwave conditions have been forecast in and around Delhi, like in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh. As per the IMD, a coldwave is declared in the plains when temperatures drop to 4°C or fall 4.5–6.4 degrees below normal.\nAdding to the discomfort, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the \" poor\" category on Friday morning, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The stagnant cold air traps pollutants closer to the ground, amplifying the smog and reducing visibility.\nToday, a thin layer of fog enveloped parts of the city as the minimum temperature dipped to 6°C. Morning visuals from India Gate and Kartavya Path revealed a smog layer, which reduced visibility significantly.\nSpecific AQI readings included 280 in Alipur, 296 in Ashok Vihar, 280 in ITO, and 228 at DTU. Higher levels of pollution were observed in Anand Vihar (309), Dwarka Sector 8 (315), Nehru Nagar (334), IGI Airport Terminal 3 (281), Rohini (329), Pusa (309), and Mundka (307). The overall AQI for Delhi at 7 AM was recorded at 277.\nThe AQI categories range from \"good\" (0-50) to \"severe\" (401-500), with \"poor\" (201-300) indicating significant health risks for sensitive groups.\nAccording to forecasts, air quality is unlikely to improve significantly over the weekend, exacerbating health risks for residents. Experts caution that such conditions could lead to respiratory issues and cardiovascular stress, especially for vulnerable groups. Authorities recommend that residents minimise outdoor activities, use air purifiers indoors, and wear protective masks when stepping out.\nTo help vulnerable populations, night shelters have been set up in several locations, including Jama Masjid and Nizamuddin flyover. More temporary solutions like restrictions on vehicle emissions and construction activities have been implemented during peak pollution months, but the city needs sustained efforts to combat seasonal smog.\n**\nFor weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

    "title": "A lenda da churrascaria de Nova York, Wolfgang Zwiener, morre aos 85 anos",
    "text": "O restauranteur Wolfgang Zwiener, o cérebro por trás da popularíssima Wolfgang Steakhouse , faleceu aos 85 anos em 23 de janeiro de 2025 em sua casa em Honolulu.\nEmbora sua cadeia global de churrascarias seja uma lenda por si só, Zwiener começou a trabalhar no icônico Peter Luger , um dos restaurantes mais lendários do mundo . Ele permaneceu lá por 39 anos.\nOs pessimistas temiam que ele não tivesse a capacidade de fazer a transição para uma nova função tão poderosa, mas após a inauguração do restaurante em 2004, seus negócios só cresceram. Há dezenas de unidades do Wolfgang’s Steakhouse nos Estados Unidos e até mesmo na Ásia. De acordo com o The New York Times , cerca de 15 outros locais globais estão programados para serem inaugurados.\nEsse tipo de trabalho está claramente presente na família de Zwiener. Seus pais administravam um restaurante na Silésia, Alemanha , e ele seguiu o exemplo, matriculando-se em um programa de hospitalidade em Bremen, Alemanha. Mais tarde, ele foi garçom em um navio de cruzeiro da linha North German Lloyd. Depois de chegar aos Estados Unidos em 1960, ele assumiu cargos de garçom no Sunnyside Brauhall, no Hilton Hotel e no Lüchow’s antes de se tornar garçom-chefe no Peter Luger’s. Embora ele tenha se tornado um nome sinônimo de churrascarias e jantares elegantes, especialmente em Nova York, entrevistas indicam que ele desencorajava seus filhos a seguir uma carreira culinária. Mas ele certamente causou um impacto em seus próprios filhos.\n“Ele tinha uma presença elegante e impressionante”, disse Mark Solasz, vice-presidente da Master Purveyors, a empresa que fornece as carnes de Wolfgang, ao The New York Times . “Ele me lembrava um ator de cinema, mas era a vida real.”\nVeja também: Um dos melhores pratos do mundo pode ser encontrado nesta churrascaria de Nova York, e não é bife",

    "title": "Boeing : Boeing paralysé : une grève historique frappe ses usines en pleine crise",
    "text": "Les salariés de\n[Boeing](/cotation/BAu) viennent de prendre une décision qui pourrait paralyser l’entreprise pour les semaines à venir : une grève massivement votée, qui débute ce vendredi 13 septembre. Le rejet de la convention collective proposée par l’avionneur, pourtant soutenue par le syndicat IAM (International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers), met en lumière les tensions internes et les frustrations accumulées au fil des ans.\nLa grève, approuvée par 96 % des employés concernés, affectera plus de 30 000 ouvriers dans les régions de Seattle et Portland, responsables de la production des modèles phares de Boeing : le 737 Max, le 777 et le 767 cargo. Ces usines, situées près de Seattle, verront leur activité complètement stoppée. Les répercussions pour Boeing, déjà confronté à des retards de livraison, seront immédiates et lourdes de conséquences financières.\nL’accord rejeté par les travailleurs de Boeing incluait une augmentation salariale de 25 % sur quatre ans, un bonus de 3 000 dollars et des avancées en matière d’assurance santé. Les syndicats avaient également obtenu un engagement de la part de l’entreprise de continuer à produire de futurs avions dans la région de Seattle, assurant ainsi des emplois à long terme. Pourtant, ces promesses n'ont pas suffi à apaiser les tensions.\nSelon Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes de Boeing, \"nos membres se sont exprimés haut et fort ce soir\". Ce rejet résulte, en grande partie, des frustrations accumulées au fil des ans. En effet, les employés avaient déjà dû faire face à des accords passés, en 2011 et 2014, qui avaient été signés sans leur consentement direct. Ces accords avaient notamment réduit les subventions accordées par Boeing aux cotisations d'assurance santé et limité les hausses de salaires.\nLes conséquences de cette grève pour Boeing risquent d’être colossales. La production des avions phares de l’entreprise sera totalement stoppée, et les livraisons, déjà en retard, subiront de nouveaux délais. Pour Boeing, qui perçoit environ 60 % des paiements à la livraison des appareils, cette grève pourrait se traduire par des pertes financières considérables. Une interruption de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités, selon des analystes cités par l’AFP.\nMalgré cela, Boeing reste \"engagé\" dans les négociations. Dans un communiqué, la direction a déclaré : \"Nous restons déterminés à rétablir nos relations avec nos employés et le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord.\"\nCette grève marque un nouveau tournant pour Boeing, qui traverse déjà une période de turbulences inédites. Depuis 2019, l’entreprise a enregistré des pertes de 22 milliards de dollars, et sa dette atteint les 60 milliards de dollars. Avec cette grève, l’avionneur pourrait se retrouver dans une situation encore plus précaire, à un moment où sa réputation est déjà\n[entachée par les accidents du 737 MAX et des retards dans la production](/marches/menace-de-poursuites-penales-boeing-doit-presenter-ses-arguments-au-plus-tard-j_633904).\nLes négociations entre Boeing et le syndicat IAM sont loin d’être terminées. Cependant, cette grève montre clairement que les salariés ne sont plus prêts à accepter des compromis qui ne répondent pas à leurs attentes. Boeing devra trouver rapidement une solution pour éviter une paralysie prolongée de ses opérations, au risque de compromettre encore davantage sa situation financière et sa reprise économique.\n© AbcBourse.com.

    "text": "Karan said as a technology giant, Google is actively working with the leading businesses in Malaysia to adopt the latest technology in AI from Google Cloud. — AFP photo\nKUALA LUMPUR (April 12): Malaysian businesses can benefit from the immense potential of artificial intelligence (AI) by establishing comprehensive upskilling programmes and adopting advanced generative AI solutions, said Google’s global head of government affairs and public policy Karan Bhatia.\nBy doing so, they can position themselves as leaders in technology and drive economic growth, he said, adding that what makes generative AI different from other forms of AI that were introduced previously is user-friendliness, in terms of helping to solve everyday problems in people’s personal or professional lives.\nPeople can use everyday language to interact with a generative AI chatbot or virtual agent as well as get it to answer questions, create content, produce images, and summarise documents, including conversations, stories, videos, and music.\n“Even better, a single generative AI platform can deliver solutions for multiple use cases, creating a network effect.\n“As the number of users and applications increases, the model is exposed to more data and becomes increasingly accurate and useful which in turn, encourages more users and, in a way, AI has the full potential to boost productivity and innovation in both the public and private sectors,” he told Bernama.\nKaran said as a technology giant, Google is actively working with the leading businesses in Malaysia to adopt the latest technology in AI from Google Cloud.\nFor example, he said Maxis Bhd is leveraging Google Cloud’s enterprise-grade generative AI capabilities to unlock its data’s full potential, while Gamuda Bhd is embracing digitalisation and generative AI to drive innovation across its operations.\nBank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd, on the other hand, is tapping into Google Cloud’s capabilities in modern infrastructure, security, data analytics, and generative AI to enhance its operational efficiencies and customer experience.\nGoogle contributes to building a safe and inclusive digital society\nRecently, Google announced an initiative to equip Malaysian youth with future-ready skills focused on AI and enhance public service delivery with the help of cloud-native, AI-driven productivity tools, a move aligned with Malaysia’s Madani Economy framework.\nThe initiative involves collaboration with the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) to upskill local youth from diverse backgrounds by providing 161 public universities, polytechnics, and community colleges in Malaysia with up to 500 Google Career Certificate scholarships each until the end of 2024.\nThis strategic initiative with MOHE marks a significant expansion of “Gemilang”, the digital training programme launched by Google in 2022 to help more Malaysians acquire digital skills – at no cost – for jobs in high-demand technology fields.\nKaran said upskilling programmes like “Gemilang” and those offered by Google lead to benefits beyond just income level and higher revenues.\nAs AI technologies expand capabilities, new AI-related jobs such as prompt engineer and AI research scientist, among others, are emerging.\n“We see AI as an opportunity to create new occupations, improve job quality, and generate significant benefits. In addition, the training programmes will enable organisations to get up-to-speed with the latest skills to help supercharge their productivity,” he said.\nKaran elaborated that those organisations that use generative AI to speed up, automate, scale, and improve business processes stand to reap big benefits.\n“Additionally, as the talent pool of highly skilled workers increases, homegrown companies are better positioned to innovate, develop cutting-edge products and services, and expand their reach. This contributes to the overall growth of employees and companies,” he said.\nSince its launch, “Gemilang” has already provided 31,000 Google Career Certificate scholarships to benefit individuals in Malaysia, with 80 per cent of certificate graduates reporting a positive career outcome, such as a new job, promotion, or salary raise within six months of completion.\nImportance of training programmes to bridge the digital talent gap\nKaran noted that Malaysia has a fast-growing digital economy that is set to account for over 25 per cent of the country’s total economic output by 2025, with a potential to reach up to US$70 billion (US$1=RM4.738) in gross merchandise value by 2030.\n“Training programmes that target the digital talent gap are critical to reaching this potential, ensuring businesses of all sizes are well equipped and prepared to fully capture growth opportunities,” he said.\nIn 2022, businesses and households in Malaysia unlocked RM51.5 billion in economic benefits from their use of Google’s AI-powered products and services.\nKaran noted that Google is aware that more people want to learn new digital skills and get jobs in high-demand fields.\n“That is why our ‘Gemilang’ programme aims to create opportunities for all Malaysians to do so at no cost,” he said, adding that Google is committed to supporting Malaysia’s digital growth ambitions.\nAI is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, like helping to reach climate goals, building sustainable growth, maintaining global competitiveness, and much more.\nHe explained that running generative AI at scale will require massive data storage and computing power, which requires investments in technical infrastructure like data centres.\n“With the support of the Malaysian government, Google is now exploring the potential establishment of an in-country Google data centre to address not only growing demand for AI services but all the digital services that Google offers in Malaysia,” Karan added. – Bernama",
