Para el elenco de [Vitamina Sánchez](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/pablo-vitamina-sanchez.html) fue como salir del vestuario abajo en el resultado. No llegó a sostener la valla invicta ni durante 60 segundos en la altura... En el primer ataque de los dueños de casa en el Estadio Municipal, el elenco comandado por Flabio Alvarez rompió el 0-0 con una gran jugada. El autor del gol fue Adalid Terrazas, quien recibió la pelota con una gambeta hizo pasar de largo a [Ricardo Adé](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/ricardo-ade.html). Luego definió con un potente remate para vencer a [Alexander Domínguez](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/alexander-dominguez.html). El festejo de los bolivianos tuvo algo de suspenso. Es que la acción fue revisada durante algunos segundos en el VAR ya que se analizó una posible infracción sobre Leonel Quiñónez antes del remate de Terrazas. Sin embargo, tras mirar varias repeticiones, desde la cabina no encontraron falta y convalidaron el tanto. El gol de Always Ready ante LDU LDU Quito -",

    "text": "As part of the “Zero Emission Ships Project” sponsored by The Nippon Foundation, Japan last week launched its first hydrogen dual-fuel tug. The vessel is pioneering using a high-power internal combustion engine with the industry seeking to develop expertise in the emerging sector.\nThe new tug was launched by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding on March 28 and is the first vessel in Japan to be equipped with a high-power output hydrogen dual-fuel internal combustion engine. It also has a high-pressure hydrogen gas storage system with a large capacity. With facilities to store approximately 250kg of high-pressure hydrogen gas, Tsuneishi says it will be possible to maintain the same operational performance as when using conventional fuel while also making use of hydrogen fuel. In the unlikely event of failure of the hydrogen fuel system, the vessel can operate with only traditional marine fuels, thus ensuring the same level of safety as conventional vessels.\n“We have successfully launched our first hydrogen-fuelled tugboat. We will utilize the know-how and design processes we have developed in the construction of hydrogen-fuelled tugboats, which require high power, in the construction of further new fuel vessels,” said Nishijima Takanori, General Manager of the Design Division and Managing Executive Officer of Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co.\nJapan's first hydrogen dual-fuel tug with an internal combustion engine (Tsuneishi Shipbuilding)\nThe shipbuilding notes that one of the challenges for tugboats is the need to be highly maneuverable and have high engine output to assist in berthing and opera operations of large vessels. This tugboat is installed with twin 12-cylinder hydrogen-blended engines (4,400 horsepower class), which will give it the needed capabilities. The vessel will be less than 300 gross tons with a length of 38 meters (125 feet).\nThe plan calls for operating with hydrogen in combination with traditional marine fuels. They are targeting reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 60 percent compared to conventional tugboats that use traditional marine fuels.\nTo further enhance the project’s overall sustainability Tsuneishi is also incorporating “JGreeX” produced by JFE Steel Corporation, It is a green steel product that was used for all of its steel plates.\nMany projects are focusing on hydrogen fuel cells instead of internal combustion engines as hydrogen remains a technology in development as a marine fuel. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges and the Savery family’s CMB.TECH launched what they said was the first hydrogen-fueled tug in 2023. Hydrotug 1 was also reported to be the largest vessel currently capable of operating solely on hydrogen. It is operating demonstrations in the port of Antwerp while CMB.TECH has developed other vessels including a crew transfer vessel using hydrogen.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - EIN Presswire)\nVictims who have received judgments against countries for their roles in supporting terrorism claim the U.S. DOJ is fighting to prevent these victims from receiving just compensations through the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.\nLevin Papantonio Attorney Chris Paulos (above) said, \"All these plaintiff-intervenors served and sacrificed for the United States and have fought for years to seek justice, only to have the DOJ steer funds explicitly earmarked for terror victims into its coffers.\"\nCounterterrorism Attorney Chris Paulos says the Department of Justice's actions have exacerbated victims' trauma.\nThe DOJ's failure to comply with the statutory requirements of the Victims Act is a grave injustice to the victims of terrorism and their families.” - CHRIS PAULOS, ATTORNEY, LEVIN PAPANTONIOWASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., August 8, 2024 /EINPresswire / -- Levin Papantonio (LP), a leading national law firm, announces the filing of an intervenor complaint on behalf of victims of state-sponsored terrorism against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Attorney General Merrick Garland (Case 1:24-cv-01865-APM ). The complaint alleges the unlawful withholding of funds from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (the“Victims Fund”).\nThe intervenor-plaintiffs are victims or family members of victims who suffered grievous injuries or death due to acts of state-sponsored terrorism. The complaint asserts that the DOJ has failed to direct the deposit of qualifying funds, specifically from the settlement of the case USA v. British American Tobacco p.l.c. et al., into the Victims Fund as mandated by law.\nAbout the Victims Fund\nIn 1996, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to allow U.S. victims of state-sponsored terrorism to seek justice against terrorist states by suing in U.S. courts. However, collecting on these judgments proved difficult until the enactment of the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act in 2015, which established the Victims Fund to compensate eligible victims. Despite this, the DOJ has made only four distributions from the Victims Fund in nine years, with many victims, including the intervenor-plaintiffs, receiving little to no compensation.\nThe complaint highlights the DOJ's refusal to direct the deposit of funds obtained from the BAT Litigation into the Victims Fund, a clear violation of the Victims Act, which requires that all proceeds from qualifying cases be deposited into the Fund. These funds are essential for providing justice and recompense to victims of state-sponsored terrorism.\nIn July, Chris Paulos , attorney at Levin Papantonio and head of the firm's counterterrorism division, together with the LP Counterterrorism Department, obtained a final judgment of over $984 million in a lawsuit against the Islamic Republic of Iran and several state-owned banks and military/intelligence agencies (ESTATE OF CHRISTOPHER BROOK FISHBECK, et al., Plaintiffs, v. THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, et al., Defendants 18-cv-2248 (CRC). The case involves members of the U.S. military and U.S. contractors who were killed or injured in terrorist attacks in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.\nAccording to Paulos, the DOJ's \"illegal money grab\" directly affects his clients.\n\"The DOJ's failure to comply with the statutory requirements of the Victims Act is a grave injustice to the victims of terrorism and their families. These individuals have already endured unimaginable suffering, and the withholding of these funds further compounds their trauma,\" Paulos said.\n\"We are committed to holding the DOJ accountable and ensuring that our clients receive the compensation they are rightfully owed,\" Paulos added.\nThe complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the DOJ to deposit the withheld funds into the Victims Fund, thereby fulfilling its statutory obligations and providing much-needed financial support to the victims and their families.Sara Stephens\nLevin Papantonio\n+1 281-744-6560\nemail us here\nVisit us on social media:\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube\nMENAFN08082024003118003196ID1108533441",

    "text": "Brazil’s Southeast may face landslides and storms until Sunday In Rio de Janeiro state, precipitation could add up to 200mm Published on 22/03/2024 - 11:35 By Sabrina Craide - Brasília click to listen: The cold front arriving in the Brazilian Southeast this Friday (Mar. 22) is expected to bring rainfall of up to 100 millimeters in 24 hours, as well as flooding and landslides. In Rio de Janeiro state, precipitation could add up to 200 millimeters by Sunday (24). The rain comes as a result of the approach of a cold front that advanced through the southern region of the country on Thursday (21). Brazil’s authority for natural disasters Cemaden reported today that the highest volumes of rain should be observed between Friday night and the early hours of Saturday. “That’s already a problem as it is, because we’ll probably accumulate significant volumes of rain during the early hours of Saturday morning, and we know that logistics become more difficult,” said Cemaden Operations Director Marcelo Seluchi. The National Meteorological Institute, Inmet, predicts very high rainfall starting today, affecting the northern coast of São Paulo, the entire state of Rio de Janeiro, the Zona da Mata in Minas Gerais, as well as the south of Espírito Santo. “If we take the total rainfall from today until Sunday, we could have over 200mm in these areas,” said the institute’s Coordinator Márcia Seabra. Forecasts also predict storm surges in some areas and waves of up to 2.5m tall on the coast of Rio de Janeiro. In Rio de Janeiro, the hardest-hit regions should be the Costa Verde, the metropolitan region and, most of all, the Região Serrana, where landslides could be widespread. “Taking into account the expected volume, we can’t rule out more serious episodes such as mass or debris flows,” said Seluchi. The situation could also affect the southern part of Minas Gerais, which borders the state. In São Paulo, overflowing is likely to happen more quickly, especially in urban areas and near streams. Landslides in São Paulo will also be more isolated and sparse, but possible road blockages, particularly on the Tamoios highway, which has a closure protocol when rainfall exceeds 100mm.

I am glad I was still able to win.\n\" From the beginning, I just tried not to do any wrong move and to be where I wanted to be and then you need to be ready for the end.\"\nNuguse added that it had been a \"lot less stressful\" than the Olympics .\n\"It is so much more fun running with these guys today!\"\nIngebrigtsen beat Hocker in the Lausanne Diamond League, then went on to smash the 3,000m world record in Silesia, but picked up an infection which he said had hampered his preparations for Zurich.\n\"My race was better than I expected it yesterday. I still have not recovered,\" the Norwegian said.\n\"It was worth it to come here and race . But one more week of recovery would have been better for me and given me more stimulation.\"\nRarely has an event been as keenly contested in recent seasons as the men's 1500m, and so it once again proved in front of a packed Letzigrund Stadium.\nSlovenia 's Zan Rudolf was the opening pacemaker, taking the pack through the opening lap in 55.\n61sec.\nThe pace saw the field strung out in single file almost from the off.\n- Fast finish -\nBritain's Elliot Giles, fresh from a world record in the road mile race , took over the pace setting, Ingebrigtsen sat on his shoulder, followed by Nuguse, Kerr and Hocker.\nGiles stepped aside at the bell for the final lap, Ingebrigtsen in the lead .\nNuguse clung to his coattails, but a gap built on Kerr and the chasing pack.\nAs Nuguse took on the Norwegian down the home straight, Hocker made a late charge, but it was too late.\nNuguse edged Ingebrigtsen, Hocker coming in third, a different winner only serving to continue pushing the competition in the event .\n\"Tactically, it is always more difficult when you have a pacer, but it makes it interesting nevertheless,\" said Hocker.\n\"In races like this, with such a field, it makes you appreciate even more when you win or do well.\"\nGoing into the Paris Olympics , the narrative had all been about Ingebrigtsen avenging his world championships loss to Kerr.\nEven World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, himself a two-time Olympic 1500m champion and whose career involved an intense rivalry with Steve Ovett, dubbed the tug-of-war between the two tremendous for the sport.\n\"It has an added piquancy because this is probably not a friendship made in heaven,\" Coe said.\nKerr and Ingebrigtsen have traded barbs since the Scot swept past the Norwegian to snatch world gold in Budapest last year.\nBut both were upstaged at the Paris Games as the unheralded Hocker surged home for gold ahead of Kerr, Nuguse taking bronze ahead of Ingebrigtsen.",
