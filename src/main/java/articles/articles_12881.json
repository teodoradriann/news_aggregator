    "text": "Northern Lights could be visible in Utah Utahns could be able to see the Northern Lights as a geomagnetic storm enters Earth’s atmosphere tonight. The National Weather Service issued a [severe geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october) for Oct. 10 and 11. Also known as a solar storm, a geomagnetic storm occurs when the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere are disrupted by bursts of radiation and charged particles emitted from the sun. The weather service reports the G4 storm level is very rare and could affect power and satellite signals. During the storm and when skies are clear, auroras could be visible as low as Alabama and northern California. Utahns who want a chance to see the lights should travel as far north as possible and find a very dark area. The lights will appear on the eastern horizon. [NOAA offers 30-minute forecast maps](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) for better predictions of when the lights could come into view.",

    "text": "REGINA —Dr. Terry Klassen, the Saskatchewan Health Authority’s new head of pediatrics, started April 1 as joint head for both the SHA and University of Saskatchewan’s College of Medicine. Dr. Klassen, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and clinician scientist, brings extensive clinical, research and leadership experience from across the prairies, according to the SHA. “My vision for pediatrics in Saskatchewan is a strong provincial system of care for children, youth and their families,” Dr. Terry Klassen said. “When emergencies happen, when care is needed, I want families to know that high-quality services and acute care are available not only at Saskatoon’s Jim Patterson Children’s Hospital, but across the province and that children will be able to go home or get closer to home as soon as possible to continue healing.” Born in Wynyard, his family moved to Manitoba when he was young. He took his medical training at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Klassen co-founded Pediatric Emergency Research of Canada (PERC), the Canadian PEM research network and Pediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN), the international Pediatric Emergency Medicine research network. He was instrumental in the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada’s recognition of pediatric emergency medicine as a subspecialty. “We are thrilled to have Dr. Terry Klassen, a nationally recognized leader and innovator in pediatrics, join the Saskatchewan Health Authority,” said SHA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw. “His vision for children’s health and care within our province will help ensure Saskatchewan’s children get the best care while also educating and inspiring the next generation of health care professionals.” Not only has his research won national awards, Klassen has robust experience as a clinician and leader. Most recently, Dr. Klassen was CEO and scientific director for the Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba and was the Scientific Director for the George and Fay Yee Center for Healthcare Innovation. “Dr. Terry Klassen will be an exemplary addition to the College of Medicine and the University of Saskatchewan,” said interim Dean Dr. Marilyn Baetz. “His commitment to research and the importance of mentoring the next generation of physicians is clearly demonstrated throughout his career.” Dr. Klassen says he is excited to return to Saskatchewan and continue to build on the successes to date, including those initiated in 2023 under the leadership of the late Dr. Patrick Brophy. He envisions a provincial pediatrics program integrated with prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services as well as robust educational opportunities for the next generation of health-care providers, and create new knowledge through research. The SHA and College of Medicine express appreciation to Dr. Matthew Bradshaw for his leadership and dedication to the department as interim department head.",

    "text": "Experts say this strange-looking, spiky creature that resembles a miniature dragon will bring disaster to whoever keeps it.\nThe man discovered a small creature with a body full of spines, which looked exactly like a small dragon on the rock. It is known that this is one of the strangest animals of the rocky plains of South Africa .\nFound in the crevices of the Succulent Karoo, the armadillo lizard (Ouroborus cataphractus) is a creature whose appearance is distinctive and adorable.\nThis lizard is a small reptile and has a variety of colors from brown to light brown yellow. However, their most unique feature is their spiky skin.\nArmadillo lizards are covered in sharp spines, except for the lower part of the abdomen. This makes the lizard’s underside vulnerable to damage by predators.\nBecause of this weakness, this strange animal has developed an equally different form of defense: curling up into a ball when threatened, revealing only the outside like an armored car.\nArmadillo lizards cower when attacked by natural enemies such as birds, snakes and mongooses. If necessary, they can remain in this position for up to an hour.\nThe Armadillo lizard is one of the few lizards that does not lay eggs and only gives birth to one or two young per year. Another feature of this strange creature is its general habitat.\nThey are social animals and therefore prefer to live and protect each other in large groups. However, the biggest threat to this lizard is humans.\nThe reptile’s small size, distinct appearance and calm behavior have made it a popular item on the pet market, especially on black markets, although trading in this lizard is considered illegal.\nA group of wildlife traders have been arrested for illegally possessing and transporting 48 armadillo lizards. The criminals were sentenced to 1 million South African Rand (equivalent to $70,000) or 13 years in prison.\nTheir food is small desert insects such as ants or termites. Because armadillo lizards move very slowly and are hunted as pets, their numbers are seriously threatened.\nThey have currently been classified as a vulnerable population by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ).",

    "title": "My Multiple Diseases Miraculously Disappeared After I Began Practicing Falun Dafa | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) I was born in southern China in 1937. My family were farmers. I was the only child and our lives were good until 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) usurped power. The CCP launched various political movements, causing farmers to become destitute. I was forced to leave my hometown. I attended school and then worked in the city. I lived a frugal life so that I could save some money and food stamps to help my parents. Due to malnutrition and mental stress, I suffered multiple diseases when I was young, including atrophic gastritis, glaucoma, frequent colds, rhinitis, severe anemia, irregular heartbeat, and palpitation. I was often dizzy, fatigued, and depressed. My life was so miserable that I did not want to live. I looked up at the sky and asked, “Why is my life so harsh? Did I do bad things in my previous life which caused me to suffer like this?” Some kind people suggested I try various religions, but I did not. In 1996, I was introduced to Falun Dafa and given a copy of [Zhuan Falun], the main book of Falun Dafa. My eyes lit up when I saw the words “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance.” I felt this was what I had been looking for. I finished reading the book within a few days. I started practicing Falun Dafa on August 16, 1996. One night after I had porridge for dinner, I suddenly had a stomachache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. But I was not afraid because I knew that Master Li, the founder of Falun Dafa, was cleansing my body. I went to the restroom all night. The diarrhea and vomiting finally stopped around 5 a.m., and I was fine. All my ailments disappeared, and my eyes no longer hurt when I read. I really enjoyed the feeling of being illness-free and walking lightly. There are no words to express my gratitude to Master and Dafa. Twenty seven years have passed by. I have not taken a pill or received an injection. I am healthy and happy. My complexion is ruddy and wrinkle free. I look younger than my actual age. My experience is proof of the miraculous health effects of Dafa. A few days ago, I talked to a woman in her seventies. She was surprised that I was 86. I told her that I was able to care for myself, including doing all the housework. She said, “This society is really messed up. No one cares about others. Many young people are not doing well. They cannot find jobs, and many of them give up working and hide themselves in temples. Rich people have moved abroad.” I said, “Most people nowadays have low morals. Why is there a plague? It is because people do not take virtue seriously and thus disasters, both natural or man-made, have come to eliminate bad people.” I urged her to quit the CCP and not be its accomplice in their evil deeds. She happily agreed and thanked me. I asked her to thank Master, instead. I also told her to remember “Falun Dafa is good, and Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.” Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved. Category: [ Health Benefits ](/cc/17/)",

    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Jakson Green is closing in on a more than 40 billion-rupee ($476.4 million) fundraise to expand its renewable energy capacity, Joint Managing Director Krishnan Kannan said.\nThe privately-held company, which currently has an installed capacity of around 250 megawatt, will add 1 gigawatt (GW) by early 2026.\n\"We are working with a strategic partner to bring in the investment. For this 1 GW, the investment will be around 40 billion rupees in a mix of 75% debt and 25% equity,\" Kannan told Reuters on Thursday on the sidelines of the Renewable Energy India Expo event in New Delhi.\nThe company is in advanced talks with green energy funds and aims to close the fundraise by November, he added.\nThe firm is part of the Jakson Group that also has a presence in solar module and cell manufacturing through another unit called Jakson Solar.\nA growing number of Indian companies are expanding their renewable energy capacity and raising funds as the government aims to add at least 500 GW of clean energy by 2030 to reduce emissions.\nJakson Green is also looking to add 1 GW of renewables capacity per annum for the next five years and will raise funds as per its requirements, Kannan said.\nJakson Green has won more than 1 GW of renewable energy projects from the Indian government, including Solar Energy Corporation of India and NHPC, and in July it secured a credit facility from First Abu Dhabi Bank for its international expansion.\nIn September, the company signed an agreement with Indian state-owned infrastructure lender REC for 14.2 billion rupees to fund Jakson's power projects.\n($1 = 83.9630 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Sethuraman NR; Editing by Sonia Cheema)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": " India's wealth and asset management industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by evolving socio-economic factors. This growth presents numerous opportunities, but it also comes with challenges. The industry is witnessing the entry of new players with diverse solutions and boutique mindsets. This can lead to talent fragmentation and changing skill requirements.\nWe must keep an open mind and experiment with emerging trends to address these challenges. Personalization, wealth creation opportunities for the sales force, and investments in technology and digitization are key areas of focus. Building a sustainable ecosystem with robust products and solutions is crucial.\nEarly market penetration and the creation of sustainable teams are critical success factors. Additionally, nurturing a strong leadership pipeline that can shape the future growth of our organization is of utmost importance. My role as CHRO involves ensuring that our people strategy aligns with these industry dynamics, enabling us to seize opportunities while addressing challenges effectively.\nThe most significant development in the HR and business landscape is the growing emphasis on fostering a holistic organizational culture that embraces shared mindsets, brand purpose, and firm values, all rooted in a high-performance orientation, which we refer to as \"Performance Plus.\" This cultural shift strongly focuses on engaging employees with a clear understanding of the company's strategic unity, purpose, and business goals. Moreover, it involves an unwavering commitment to aligning actions and mindsets with these overarching objectives.\nIn addition to culture, customer centricity is emerging as a pivotal aspect of HR and business strategies. Organizations are actively working to cultivate enduring relationships of trust with their target customers. This customer-centric approach extends from ideation to execution, incorporating key metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) and market share as indicators of success.\nCollaboration is yet another integral facet of this landscape transformation, emphasizing cross-functional teamwork, alliances, and partnerships.\nOrganisations are increasingly recognizing the power of collaboration in achieving shared objectives and driving innovation.\nOverall, this evolving landscape places a premium on clarity, shared agendas, and a collective mindset that fosters a deep commitment to strategic unity and purpose. These developments represent a profound shift in how businesses operate and succeed in today's dynamic and interconnected world.\nAs for a prediction for 2024, I foresee a bold shift towards a more balanced and harmonious alignment of interests among employees, companies, and stakeholders. This shift will leverage the flexibility gained in recent years to create a resilient and sustainable business ecosystem. It will be marked by a renewed focus on the well-being and alignment of all parties involved, reflecting the lessons learned from the challenges and changes of the past few years.",
