    "text": "Good morning. This is the Thursday, Dec. 28 edition of First Up, the Star’s daily morning digest. Sign up\nto get it earlier each day, in your inbox.\nHere’s the latest on the recent spike in labour trafficking prosecutions, the future of Toronto’s parking meters and Toronto churches’ struggle to shelter refugees.\nDON’T MISS:\nThis Mountie helped dismantle a suspected labour trafficking ring — now he’s accused of starting his own\nIn late 2019, investigators had just dismantled what they alleged was a large labour trafficking ring in the Hamilton area. Officers criminally charged six people under worker exploitation laws after finding as many as 80 foreign workers housed in bug- and vermin-infested conditions, and being sent to work across southern Ontario, police said at the time. Now, police allege RCMP Const. Yahsif Israel Mane Monter learned how the Hamilton trafficking scheme operated — and then started his own, Sara Mojtehedzadeh and Rachel Mendleson report.\nHere’s what else police material obtained by the Star reveals.\nWait, what? Monter was arrested in May 2022 on human trafficking and several other charges, including firearm violations and animal cruelty related to his dog-breeding business, “Taskforce Rottweilers.”\nWord from Monter: Monter, who has been released on bail ahead of his scheduled May 2024 trial, declined to comment. His lawyer said he “will be pleading not guilty.”\nTime’s up for Toronto’s coin-only parking meters\nYou might be interested in\nIn 2000, Toronto had 16,000 coin-only parking meters. Today, only 178 remain — but their time is up, David Rider reports. The technological dinosaurs will be gone in the new year in the name of progress and city finances. They could be replaced with pay-and-display boxes, the city’s new “pay by plate” machines or even a new “mobile only” zones with no device at all.\nHere’s how the relics made their way into the city — and why they’re on their way out.\nWait, what? “We are collecting, on average, about 18 cents a day at single-space meters that cost about 87 cents a day to operate,” said Jeff Dea, the Toronto Parking Authority’s vice-president of business development. “They are really old, they’re at the end of their service life, they’re not running well and require continual maintenance so it’s time to pull them off the street and replace them with something better.”\nMore: Dea said the parking authority’s modernization plan also foresees the use of cameras to automatically record licence plates and bill the vehicle’s owner.\nCiting dwindling government support, Toronto churches are forced to close their doors to refugees\nFor nearly six months, volunteers and staff at two Toronto churches have worked overtime to shelter, support and feed hundreds of refugees arriving at their doors. But church leaders have seen the growing toll, from shelter workers experiencing psychological breakdowns to mounting personal credit card debt as the churches wrack up more than $800,000 in bills, Emily Fagan reports. Meanwhile, donations are dwindling and government support is sparse.\nHere’s why one church leader was shocked to hear the government wouldn’t be helping more.\nWord from Toronto: A spokesperson for the city said Toronto is working to support refugee claimants — but the absence of $97 million in promised federal funding has been challenging. The city estimates it will have spent $103 million supporting refugees this year, with hopes the federal government reimburses the money.\nWord from Ottawa: An Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada spokesperson said minister Marc Miller is in touch with Mayor Olivia Chow to discuss solutions, citing the $7 million asylum seekers reception centre in Peel Region announced last month.\nWHAT ELSE:\n-\nWant to see Doug Ford and Pierre Poilievre lose? Then the left needs to get its act together, Martin Regg Cohn writes.\n-\nThe UN is warning of impeded aid deliveries to Gaza as Israel expands its offensive. Here’s the latest.\n-\nPeel police are investigating a potential link between a gold seizure in Montreal and gold heist at Pearson Airport.\n-\nDonald Trump says he didn’t know his immigration rhetoric echoes Hitler. That’s part of a broader pattern.\n-\nProfits, losses and the bottom line. Here are five Canadian stocks to watch in 2024.\n-\nWhen did so many famous faces start looking the same? The look has never been mor e common — or achievable.\n-\nHere’s what will be trending in cruising in 2024, from the rise of boutique ships to the extra-extra long stay.\nPOV:\nCLOSE-UP:\nSOUTHERN GAZA: Palestinian journalists attempt to connect to the internet in Rafah on Wednesday, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas.

    "text": "A lawsuit seeks to block Louisiana's new congressional map that has 2nd mostly Black district\nThe Louisiana Legislature's redrawn congressional map giving the state a second mostly Black congressional district is being challenged in a new federal lawsuit\nNEW ORLEANS -- The Louisiana Legislature's redrawn congressional map giving the state a second mostly Black district is being challenged by 12 self-described “non-African American” voters in a new lawsuit.\nThe challenge filed Wednesday and assigned to a judge in Lafayette says the map, which Republican lawmakers agreed to as a result of a 2022 federal lawsuit filed in Baton Rouge, is the result of “textbook racial\ngerrymandering.”\nIt seeks an order blocking the map's use in this year's\nelection and the appointment of a three-judge panel to oversee the case.\nAt least one person, state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from Baton Rouge, has already said he will be a candidate in the new district. It is not clear how the lawsuit will affect that district or the 2022 litigation, which is still ongoing.\nNew government district boundary lines are redrawn by legislatures every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data. Louisiana's Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that was challenged by voting rights advocates because only one of six U.S. House maps was majority Black, even though the state population is roughly one-third Black. A veto of the map by then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, was overridden.\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their suit claiming it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling in June that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.\nIn November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district.\nGov. Jeff Landry, a Republican who succeeded Edwards in January, was the state's attorney general and was among GOP leaders who had opposed Dick's rulings. But he called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.\nThe bill he backed links Shreveport in the northwest to parts of the Baton Rouge area in the southeast, creating a second majority-Black district while also imperiling the reelection chances of Rep. Garrett Graves, a Republican who supported an opponent of Landry's in the governor's race.\nLandry's office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nAlthough the new lawsuit names the state's top election official, Secretary of State Nancy Landry, as the defendant, it was filed in Louisiana's western federal district. The suit said it was proper to file there because voters \"suffered a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments in this district.\"\nMost of the judges in the Western District were nominated to the bench by Republicans. The assigned judge, David Joseph, was appointed by former President\nDonald Trump.",

    "text": "College of St. Scholastica Students Give Back to the Community DULUTH, Minn. — The College of St. Scholastica is dedicating February 28th as a day to give back to the community. Community Day has been going on at the college since 1999. Around 800 students, faculty, and staff were out Wednesday volunteering. One group of students were at the Damiano Center helping sort clothes for those in need. A student says a big reason why he chose to go to CSS was because of their impact in the community. “I think it’s so important especially in where the society we live in today too. You know we’re so technologically surrounded that you know we just sort of get away from that and go out in the community and get in person with people and just one on one and just get back to we could call roots,” said Ryane Renebrager, freshman at CSS. Damiano Center staff says they had to stop asking for clothing donations for the month of February as they were overwhelmed with how many that were donated. The student’s work is helping them out tremendously. “It gets it back into the community faster for those in need. And so, I just hope that they take away a sense of pride, a sense of accomplishment, a sense of just joy for all the work that they’re doing here today,” said Rebecca VanGrevenhof, Clothing Programs Coordinator at the Damiano Center. Other Community Day projects included help at Second Harvest and the Lake Superior Railroad Museum. New this year were on-campus workshops. Those took place to help students understand why community building and service is so important.",

    "text": "Las fotos del lindo gesto de Romell Quioto en la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer. Romell Quioto visitó este jueves la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer y compartió un lindo gesto con los pequeños. ¡Lindo detalle! El futbolista hondureño llevaba consigo juguetes para obsequiar a la fundación. Desde tempranas horas, Romell Quioto se hizo presente en la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer para entregar sus obsequios. Entre balones, pistas de carrera, automóviles, dinosaurios, fueron algunos de los juguetes que regaló el jugador catracho. El exjugador del FC Montreal llevó variedad de regalos a la Fundación en la mañana de este jueves. Romell Quioto aprovechó sus días libres mientras define su futuro y aprovechó para tener un lindo gesto en la Tegucigalpa. “Es algo que he venido haciendo desde un par de años atrás y este año no lo podía dejar pasar. Gracias a Dios se nos dio la oportunidad de estar aquí”, expresó Quioto a los medios de comunicación. Y agregó: ““A medida que van pasando los años, es algo que siempre me llena y me toca el corazón, me gusta apoyar a los niños”. Romell Quioto se ha caracterizado por formar parte de estos lindos gestos en el país, por lo que en sus días libres aprovecha para tener estos gestos. Pistas de carreras, balones de fútbol, carros, muñecas y otro tipos de juguetes entregó “El Romántico” en la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer. El centro médico se llenó de estos lindos regalos entregados por Romell Quioto, quien en las próximas horas podría marcharse al fútbol de Asia. Romell Quioto se mostró muy alegre con los pequeños, se tomó fotografías y compartió sus obsequios en la fundación. El catracho también aprovechó para firmar algunos autógrafos para algunos de los presentes. “Estas son cosas que nacen del corazón de uno y el que tenga la capacidad, oportunidad de hacerlo, bienvenido sea”, comentó Quioto. Los niños se mostraron muy contentos de recibir los juguetes entregados por el futbolista hondureño este jueves en Tegucigalpa. “Son cosas que, en lo personal, uno fue niño, no siempre en estas instancias del año, sino en todo el año. Son cosas que son difíciles de conseguirlas. Ahora que puede ayudar, lo hago”, agregó Quioto. El catracho llevó una pequeña alegría a la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer a unos días de finalizar el 2023. Estas son algunas de las postales que capturaron las cámaras de Diario LA PRENSA sobre el lindo gesto de Romell Quioto en la Fundación Hondureña para el Niño con Cáncer.",

    "text": "Tech4Dev, a non-profit social enterprise, has announced the launch of an outsourcing enterprise aimed at employing 100,000 young Africans over the next seven years.\nThe firm stated that the creation of its new enterprise, Taltrix, was driven by the need to empower graduates with various digital and creative skills training initiatives, to create a lifeline in the face of unemployment in the country and across the continent.\nIt said the enterprise already had infrastructure set up across 14 cities in Nigeria with a total capacity to employ 1,000 people.\nThe country’s unemployment rate rose marginally to 4.2 per cent in Q2 2023 from 4.1 per cent in Q1 2023, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nRecalled that the NBS adopted a new methodology for its jobless rate reports, which changed the country’s unemployment rate of 33.3 per cent as of Q4 2020 to 5.3 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2022.\nIt noted that its project was launched in collaboration with Impact Hub Lagos and Univelcity and hosted by Microsoft Nigeria.\nIn a statement, Taltrix Chief Executive Officer, Joel Ogunsola, said, “Over the next seven years, we want to directly employ 100,000 people, starting from Nigeria and across Africa. We believe that the outsourcing sector has the probability to grow to become a $200bn sector on the continent.\n“There are so many variables that combine to favour outsourcing in Africa currently. We have multinational companies with local presence and experience that are looking for cheaper and more effective options to deliver on their day-to-day tasks and deliverables. Also, the new administration has made a bold commitment to enable the employment of a million people through outsourcing which keys into our vision at Taltrix.”\nAlso, the Executive Director, Tech4Dev, Oladiwura Oladepo, stated, “Taltrix is not just about filing job roles, we are investing in human capital development to reduce unemployment and underemployment, which will in turn drive economic growth, and shape a brighter future for Africa.\n“We are also building a bridge to connect underserved unrepresented and underrepresented demographics of young people with globally in-demand opportunities for skilled professionals.”\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer of Impact Hub Lagos, Mrs Solape Hammond, the platform has the potential to help Nigerians thrive in their local communities.\nShe declared, “Taltrix excites me with its potential for nationwide inclusivity. It focuses on building communities everywhere by providing essential infrastructure like power, Internet, and engaging young people. This approach can decentralize urban migration, allowing young Nigerians to thrive in their own communities with the resources they need.”\nThe General Manager of Microsoft Nigeria and Ghana, Ola Williams, added, “Personally, as a Nigerian, I’m thrilled about this. Leading Microsoft here means we can use initiatives like Taltrix to fulfil our mission of enabling everyone on planet earth. We’re eager to partner with Taltrix and deepen the impact the job creation capabilities will have on Nigeria’s economy and the continent at large.”\nSince it was founded in 2016, Tech4Dev claimed that it has equipped 120,298 Africans with digital, entrepreneurship, and life skills across 22 countries on the continent.",
