Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Centella asiatica is a popular skincare ingredient, particularly known for its ability to hydrate, heal, and prevent aging. It’s an antioxidant-rich moisturizer that is known to repair sensitive and damaged skin.\nHistorically, it's been used in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda for wound healing, reducing inflammation, and treating skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. In the recent past, the ingredient has started to make its way into the beauty industry. More recently, you might have seen it in Korean skincare products, although it has entered the worldwide beauty market as well.\nLet’s explore the skin benefits and uses of Centella Asiatica and discover how it can help level up how your skin looks for the better.\nWhat is Centella Asiatica? Centella Asiatica is also known as Cica or Gotu Kola. The botanical herb grows primarily in Asia in tropical swampy areas. Cica is packed with goodness that can bring out the skin’s true beauty. Asiatic acid, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and madecassoside are the four main bioactive compounds found in Cica that are beneficial for the skin.\nBenefits of Centella Asiatica for skin Cica is a multipurpose component used in skincare and cosmetic products. Let's explore every one of its benefits for skin below.\nMoisturizing: Cica is rich in nutrients, which is why it’s used in many skincare products . Some of its moisturizing effects come from the fatty acids, amino acids, and beta-carotene. Amino acids, in particular, are known for their hydrating qualities. It can deal with skin dullness and dryness, leaving the skin feeling supple and glowy.\nView this post on Instagram Instagram Post\nSoothing: The main active component of Cica is asiaticosides. It’s a saponin well known to soothe and heal the skin. Because of this, Centella Asiatica is ideal for restoring the moisture barrier of the skin. It provides relief to those who have itchy, irritated, or inflamed skin.\nHealing: Another key component of the plant is the antioxidant and amino acid-rich bioactive compound madecassoside. It promotes collagen formation, which gives the skin firmness and elasticity. For people with acne-prone skin , Cica helps reduce inflammation, speed up healing, and reduce acne scarring.\nAnti-aging: Madecassoside in Cica also delays and reduces signs of aging. In addition, Cica packs antioxidants thanks to its plenty of natural flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It can help fight against damage from free radicals, whether it’s from pollution or the sun. It also helps lessen fine lines and wrinkles because it improves collagen production.",

    "text": "COIMBATORE: Tamil Nadu opener N Jagadeesan enjoyed a fruitful day as he struck an unbeaten 155 against Railways during their Ranji Trophy Group C fixture here on Friday.After winning the toss and opting to bat, the hosts began on a shaky note, losing Vimal Khumar (0) in the opening over to pacer Yuvraj Singh with just a run on the board.Jagadeesan and B Sachin (33) added 83 runs for the second wicket before the latter was stumped off Akash Pandey.TN lost their fourth wicket at 130 before Jagadeesan and Boopathi Kumar (67) joined forces and tailored a 142-run partnership for the fifth wicket.Even as Jagadeesan reached his century, Boopathi was dismissed by Mohammad Saif.The hosts ended the day at 286 for five, while Pandey claimed two wickets for the visitors.In another Group C clash in Mysore, Goa ended the day at 228 for eight against Karnataka, thanks to Snehal Kauthankar's composed knock of 83.Opting to bat, Goa were struggling at 45 for three, while opener Suyash Prabhudessai, who struck 197 in the last meet, was dismissed for 27.Then, Kauthankar and skipper Darshan Misal (39) constructed an 82-run stand for the fourth wicket. However, the pair failed to last long, with the captain departing to Rohit Kumar.Vijaykumar Vyshak and Rohit grabbed three wickets each for the hosts.The other two Group C matches -- Chandigarh vs Gujarat in Chandigarh and Punjab vs Tripura in Mohali -- did not see any play due to poor visibility.Brief scores:In Coimbatore: Tamil Nadu 286-5 (N Jagadeesan 155, Boopathi Kumar 67; Akash Pandey 2/74) vs Railways.In Mysore: Goa 228-8 (Snehal Kauthankar 83; Vijaykumar Vyshak 3/35, Rohit Kumar 3/66) vs Karnataka.",

    "text": "Obituary: Day, James (Jim) Martin James (Jim) Martin Day, 76, of Little Hocking, OH, passed away peacefully at his home on February 20, 2024. He was born in Middletown, NY, a son of the late Frank and Edna (Martin) Day. James dreamed of being a truck driver since the age of 5, and he was able to fulfill his dream. He retired from truck driving, a job he loved, after 52 years. James was a good man who loved his wife. In fact, he once told her that the only competition she would ever have was his love for motorcycles. He served honorably in the Army and was a Vietnam Veteran. James is survived by his wife Rosie Day, one son James Day of Farmington, Missouri, two daughters Michelle Williford of Missouri, Meredith Clinger of St. Genevive, Missouri and step-sons Oren and Lincoln Echard of Little Hocking, OH. Thank you to the hospice staff for being there and for your support. A special thank you to whom he called his angel, Keeley Johnson, and his friend and chaplain, Ryan Clegg. There will be no visitation or memorial services. Jim has already said his goodbyes and saw those he wanted to see. Rosie would like to say thanks to her special sister, Brenda Miller, for all of her help, support, and just being there for comfort. Arrangements entrusted to Leavitt Funeral Home, Belpre.

    "title": "Galaxy S24's Cheaper Prices Could Spell Trouble for Samsung's Rivals",
    "text": "Cheaper Galaxy S24 Prices Could Spell Trouble For Samsung's Rivals [ Jade Bryan Junior Editor ](/user/7734655/jade-bryan) As 2023 comes to a close, it appears that leaks about the [Galaxy S24](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-release-date-price-specs-when-can-you-buy) continue to appear more frequently. After we learned the [full specifications of the trio](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-better-gaming-large-vapor-chamber-cooling), two new rumors from separate sources shed more light on the pricing strategy of Samsung, at least in the majority of Europe. Right now, it's unclear whether this will dictate the prices in other regions, including the US. Firstly, Galaxy Club cited its sources that the vanilla Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ will be cheaper than their predecessors. Both base models of the two are said to be €50 cheaper. In particularly, the smaller Galaxy S24 is set to retail for €899 ($995) while the Plus will go for €1,149 ($1,270). Do take note that these alleged price leaks are for the Europe region, hence the currency denomination. If luck is on our side, this is great news for fans, especially that there are rumors of the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ getting [bigger starting storage and RAM](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-memory-storage-ram-amount-how-much) in some markets. However, bear in mind that prices in other European countries may vary. As for the [high-end Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-natural-camera-image-processing-pixel), the outlet suggested it will be a tad pricier with a price tag of €1,449 ($1,600!!!). Notably, this is a €50 increase from the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Before your eyes pop out further, the higher cost could be offset by a larger memory configuration. It was speculated earlier that the [upcoming premium smartphone](https://www.nextpit.com/best-phones) will sport a 12 GB RAM and 256 GB internal storage configuration in its base model. There is no word whether the European prices indicate the cost of the Galaxy S24 outside the region though. Earlier this month, a South Korean publication reported that the [Galaxy S24's prices will remain unchanged](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-final-pric-no-change-upgrade-memory) from the Galaxy S23. It was assumed that this concerned the US, which would place the Galaxy S24 at $799, Galaxy S24+ at $999, and Galaxy S24 Ultra at $1,199, before relevant taxes are applied. With what is coming up, the Galaxy S24 may undercut many of the alternatives from its competitors. For example, the Pixel 8 and [Pixel 8 Pro (review)](https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-8-pro-review) have become more expensive than the Pixel 7 duo. The same applies for [Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Max (review)](https://www.nextpit.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review), although it now offers double the storage. Fortunately, we don't need to wait longer to confirm these prices. Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S24 on January 17 in San Jose, California, which would be around three weeks from now. What are your thoughts on the alleged prices of the Galaxy S24? Tell us in the comments.",

    "text": "Conservative group runs $200k ad blitz blaming Rachel Morin killing on Biden policies Published in [Political News](/politics/politicalnews/) A digital ad campaign blaming the killing of Rachel Morin on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies is targeting audiences in swing states this week. The roughly $200,000 ad blitz comes as Biden prepares for his first debate this election season with former president Donald Trump, who has seized on Morin’s death to attack his Democratic opponent’s border policies. The ad campaign was bankrolled by a conservative group called “Building America Better,” which had already spent more than $724,000 this year on two ads, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. No disclosure about the most recent ad campaign had been filed with the commission Thursday afternoon. Both of those election year ads also play on fears over immigration, interspersing news reels of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants with statements from either of the presidential candidates. Morin’s killing immediately reached national attention last August after the mother of five was found dead on the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air. But months later, after authorities identified the suspect as a 23-year-old from El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully, the Harford County homicide quickly became the latest center of the nationwide flareup over U.S. immigration and border policy. Thursday’s debate comes amid that flareup. Trump, who has long made inflammatory statements about immigrants, and other Republicans have targeted the Biden administration on immigration over the Morin case, claiming deficiencies have allowed criminals into the country. Democrats have responded by noting the GOP’s rejection of border enforcement measures that could have aided Biden politically during the election year. A website for Building America’s Future does not disclose much more than its other campaigns, which include a six-figure ad targeting swing states opposing the Biden administration’s proposed rules that ban menthol cigarettes. The tax-exempt group formed in 2020 named Chris Jankowski, who ran a super PAC supporting Trump’s former rival Ron DeSantis, as one of its officers in a 2023 filing to Virginia business regulators. Jankowski’s name was removed in an annual report filed Thursday morning that names several other Washington-area political strategists in its list of officers. Morin’s mother has “had a chance to view” the 60-second video that anchors the digital ad campaign but “doesn’t have any comments right now,” said Randolph Rice, an attorney who represents Patty Morin and other family members. Shortly after 23-year-old Victor Martinez-Hernandez was arrested in connection with Morin’s killing, Trump called Morin’s mother, Patty, to express his condolences. Patty said she was “deeply touched by President Trump’s kindness and concern” in an earlier statement released by the family’s attorney. Matthew McMahon, the father of Rachel Morin’s oldest daughter, said he had viewed the video and is “appalled.” “They are using Rachel to divide the country,” McMahon said, noting that he felt the video held an “underlying tone of division.” ...continued ©2024 The Baltimore Sun.

Sigue la preocupación de los habitantes de Barrancabermeja, Santander, por los constantes hurtos que se vienen presentando en diferentes modalidades en el Distrito Petrolero. La denuncia más reciente ocurrió el pasado martes 11 de junio, en horas de la mañana, en la plaza de mercado Torcoroma ubicada en la calle 50 con carrera 20.

Mientras ingresaba a la plaza, afuera su cómplice lo esperaba en una motocicleta para que una vez tuvieran los elementos de valor, huir con rumbo desconocido. La víctima del hurto fue una mujer que se encontraba en un puesto de venta de quesos. El ladrón la identificó y se le acercó sacando lo que sería un arma de fuego. La intimidó y en cuestión de segundos se apoderó de una cadena de oro y su celular. Con los objetos en sus manos salió corriendo a buscar a su secuaz sin que nadie lo detuviera. “A la cliente la venían como siguiendo. El tipo fue directamente por ella. Creo que la seguían por la cadena de oro. La verdad esas joyas son mejor dejarlas en casa. Muy preocupante que ni salir a hacer mercado se pueda hacer de manera segura en Barrancabermeja”, expresó un comerciante de la plaza. La Policía del Magdalena Medio analiza los videos para dar con los ‘motoladrones’ y espera el apoyo ciudadano que brinde información sobre la ubicación de estos sujetos.
