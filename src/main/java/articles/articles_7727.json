Pour la quatrième journée consécutive, l'armée israélienne a mené des dizaines de frappes visant la milice chiite libanaise Hezbollah qui a ouvert le 8 octobre 2023 un front contre Israël en soutien au Hamas palestinien, promettant de continuer ses attaques 'jusqu'à la fin de l'agression à Gaza'. Israël a indiqué avoir attaqué jeudi 75 objectifs militaires du Hezbollah dans le sud et l'est du Liban, affirmant en soirée mener de nouvelles frappes contre la formation pro-iranienne dans le sud du Liban. Le Hezbollah a par ailleurs confirme la mort de Mohammed Srour, chef de son unité de drones.

Log in here » VICTORIA – British Columbia’s Opposition leader says community safety should come before protection of privacy rights for dangerous people. The public should know who is living in their community, BC United Leader Kevin Falcon said on Thursday after introducing proposed private-member’s legislation to automatically stop people convicted of dangerous offences from legally changing their names. He said he introduced the proposed bill to amend the Name Act after learning child-killer Allan Schoenborn was recently permitted to legally change his name. Schoenborn was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of his children, aged five, eight and 10, whose bodies were found in the family’s Merritt, B.C., home in 2008. A judge ruled he was not criminally responsible because of a mental disorder after the verdict. His new identity has not been made public. His name change came to light when he asked the BC Review Board — the body that determines his custody status every year — to restrict publication of his new legal name. The board denied the application, saying it would give Schoenborn until April 30 to seek a legal review of its decision. If no legal action is taken, the board said it will use Schoenborn’s current legal and former names in its reasons for disposition. Falcon said the NDP government has the power under the current Name Act to prevent name changes, but it did not do that with Schoenborn, who has been held at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Coquitlam, B.C., since 2010. “This is a huge problem for the safety of communities,” he said at a news conference. “And as I often say around these issues, when government balances competing interests, I put the interests of community safety well above the interest of Allan Schoenborn to have his name changed so that he can move around the community unnoticed.” Falcon said recently permitting Schoenborn to change his name is “not acceptable.” He said he fears a dangerous person could “show up in your community, perhaps even in a neighbourhood living in a basement suite across the street, without you even being aware because the NDP allowed his last name to be changed without anyone knowing what the new name is.” The Opposition’s Name Amendment Act, if passed, would automatically prevent people designated as a dangerous or long-term offender under the Criminal Code from filing applications to change their name, said Falcon. “Currently, Vital Statistics, under the Ministry of Health, has complete authority to deny any change of name application that is ‘sought for an improper purpose or is on any other ground objectionable,'” Falcon said in the legislature. “This government failed to use that to prevent Schoenborn’s name change.” Falcon called on the legislature to pass his private member’s bill as soon as possible. Premier David Eby said earlier he would look at the current name-change legislation because people should not be able to evade responsibility for criminal offences by changing their names. This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "text": "„Tyrann großgezogen“ – Mutter scheitert mit weit verbreitetem Erziehungskonzept\nEine Mutter verzweifelt an der Erziehung ihres Sohnes. Experten erklären, woran es bei der Erziehungsmethode scheitert.\nBedürfnisorientierte Erziehung ist für viele Eltern das Ziel, wenn es um ihre Kinder geht. In den vergangenen Jahren ist diese Erziehungsmethode zu einem regelrechten Trend geworden. In zahlreichen Blogs und auf Social Media berichten Eltern davon, wie sie ihre Kinder bedürfnisorientiert erziehen. Doch einige Erfahrungsberichte zeigen auch, wie Mütter und Väter mit dieser Methode an ihre Grenzen stoßen.\nEine Mutter berichtet im Online-Forum Reddit davon, wie sie ihren Sohn ungewollt zu einem „kleinen Tyrannen großgezogen“ habe: „Ich habe das Gefühl, ich ziehe mir gerade ein kleines Arschloch groß – und dieser Satz tut mir schon beim Schreiben in der Seele weh.“\nDie alleinerziehende Mutter berichtet davon, wie ihr knapp vierjähriger Sohn ein „extrem schwieriges“ Verhalten zeigen würde, vor allem gegenüber ihr: „Drama. Wut. Respektlosigkeit. Schreien, Befehlston, Kommandieren, Tritte, Ausraster – gefühlt jeden Tag schlimmer“. Sie habe ihn von Anfang an „sehr bedürfnisorientiert begleitet“ und zweifele nun, ob dies der richtige Schritt war.\nZweifel an bedürfnisorientierter Erziehung: Expertin kritisiert Umsetzung\nEinige Kommentare sehen den Fehler tatsächlich bei der Erziehungsmethode. „Viele Kinder von sehr bedürfnisorientiert erziehenden Eltern sind einfach völlig überreizt und überfordert mit den ganzen Infos und Entscheidungen“, heißt es von einem Nutzer. Bedürfnisorientiert erziehen bedeute nicht, dass das Kind alles bekommt, was es will oder dass es nie ein „Nein“ hören dürfe. Viel mehr sollten Kinder lernen, dass auch andere Menschen Bedürfnisse haben, die es zu beachten gelte, erklärt ein Nutzer.\n„Dieses extrem bedürfnisorientierte Erziehen bedeutet, die Kinder einfach machen zu lassen, wonach ihnen gerade ist. Wenn sie der Meinung sind, sie müssen ihren Freund prügeln, dann sollen sie das tun, um herauszufinden, wie sich das anfühlt“, sagt die Therapeutin und Autorin Melanie Hubermann BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA. Kinder sollen sich möglichst frei entfalten, doch alles zu erlauben sei der falsche Weg: „Wir müssen Kindern Werte vermitteln und Grenzen setzen“, sagt Hubermann. „Wir überfordern Kinder, wenn wir ihnen nicht die Welt altersgerecht kleinhalten – mithilfe von Struktur und Regeln.“\nKinderarzt warnt: Mütter dürfen ihre eigenen Bedürnisse nicht nur zurückstellen\nAuch der Kinder- und Jugendarzt Burkard Voigt kritisiert gegenüber BuzzFeed News Deutschland: „Bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung ist schön und gut, aber oft verwechseln Eltern ihre Bedürfnisse mit denen des Kindes.“ Der Mediziner bestätigt damit die Vermutung vieler Reddit-Nutzer, die nicht grundsätzlich von der bedürfnisorientierten Erziehung abraten, aber beobachten, dass diese oft falsch verstanden werde.\n„Eltern müssen lernen, sich von ihren Kindern wieder mehr abzugrenzen. Eltern und gerade Mütter dürfen ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse nicht immer nur zurückstellen“, sagt Voigt. Man dürfe nicht vergessen, so der Arzt, dass zum Beispiel ein Neugeborenes ein „emotionaler kleiner Tyrann“ sei, „dem ist es völlig egal, wie die Mutter sich fühlt“.\nWie sollte sich die Mutter also verhalten, wenn ihr Sohn wiederholt nicht auf sie hört? „Kinder müssen lernen, dass sie nicht alleine auf diesem Planeten sind und ihre Bedürfnisse auch manchmal aufschieben müssen“, sagt der Psychiater und Bindungsforscher Simon Meier zu BuzzFeed News Deutschland. Eltern würden nicht sofort Bindungsstörungen auslösen, wenn sie Wutanfälle ihrer Kinder auch mal ignorierten. Ärger müsse nicht immer getröstet werden, auch kleine Kinder könnten ihn „relativ gut regulieren“, sagt Meier.",
