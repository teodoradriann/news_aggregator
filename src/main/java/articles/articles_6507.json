    "text": "The weather forecast has prompted Johnsburg to cancel its Holiday Magic Parade, which was scheduled to take place Saturday evening and include a tree-lighting and fireworks.\nAlthough temperatures are expected to be milder Saturday than in recent days, with highs in the mid-30s, there’s also a high chance of rain to spoil parade plans.\n[In the announcement on the village’s website](https://www.johnsburg.org/bc-cac/page/canceled-due-forecast-weather-6th-annual-holiday-magic-parade-and-event-fireworks-tree), which features a photo of the Grinch, officials wrote that they are having “ongoing discussion and planning efforts for an alternate event for families to still participate with meeting Santa, holiday crafts, etc.“\nThe statement said there were not yet firm plans, but that officials are looking at Dec. 20 for a “possible modified/alternate Holiday Magic Event.”\n“We apologize in advance to all the registered participants and families looking forward to this holiday event; however, Santa and holiday elves will be sending further communications via all North Pole networks,” according to the announcement.\nAssistant Village Administrator Vinny Lamontagna wrote in an email to the Northwest Herald Friday afternoon that it was “never our intention to cancel.” He said the village was ready for the possibility of colder temperatures or snow, but the potential for icy conditions in the forecast – and the impact on the parade and spectators and the ability to put on a good fireworks show after the tree-lighting – were “not in our favor.”",

    "title": "Tennessee tornadoes: Where did they hit, what their EF rating is, more",
    "text": "Tennessee tornadoes: 3 confirmed, National Weather Service out to check for more Friday [Joyce Orlando](https://www.tennessean.com/staff/6478576002/joyce-orlando/) The National Weather Service confirmed that at least three tornadoes plowed through Middle Tennessee Wednesday, and crews were still surveying damages Friday, so the count could rise. The Nashville office posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, late Thursday that tornadoes touched down in Maury County, in Columbia, in Robertson County, near Springfield and in Rutherford County, in Eagleville, leaving behind a path of destruction, injuries and [at least one death.](/story/news/local/2024/05/09/columbia-tornado-victim-cheryl-lovett-tennessee/73628955007/) Crews responsible for determining if a tornado happened and the path that it took were scheduled to go out again Friday, according to the social media post. \"We know that there are other tornadoes from yesterday, and our survey teams will regroup and head back out Friday morning,\" read [a reply post to the original tweet.](https://twitter.com/NWSNashville/status/1788764234538721577) As we wait for updates on the number of tornadoes that actually hit the area, here's what we know so far about the confirmed ones. Tennessee tornadoes: What part was hit? What were the wind speeds? The weather service confirmed [three tornadoes touched down in Columbia and also in Robertson and Rutherford Counties.](/story/news/local/2024/05/09/tennessee-tornadoes-deadly-twisters-hit-hard-near-nashville/73628472007/) Columbia was by the far the strongest and most destructive, as of Friday. The tornado that hit Columbia was rated at a EF-3 with winds upward of 140 mph, while Robertson County near Springfield was hit with and EF-1 with 90 mph winds and Rutherford County near Eagleville was hit with an EF-0 with 80 mph winds. [Multiple people were injured and at least one person died due to the storms.](/story/news/2024/05/09/tennessee-tornados-2024-vigil-attracts-500-asher-sullivan-rutherford-county/73632545007/) Crews were continuing to work on cleaning up the damage left behind by the storms as the weekend approached. What causes a tornado? The National Weather Service defines a tornado as \" a violently rotating column of air touching the ground, usually attached to the base of a thunderstorm\". The main reason we can see a tornado is because of the funnel made up of water droplets, dust and debris. While the wording of definitions may vary, there is one constant: For a weather phenomenon to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground and a thunderstorm cloud at the same time, the [Storm Prediction Center](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration states. No ground contact means it's just a funnel cloud. How is a tornado confirmed? The first step of confirming a tornado is gathering information from the people who are dealing with it first hand: emergency personnel, weather spotters and the public. Information, videos and photos gathered from these sources allows crews with the National Weather Service to determine if an investigation is needed in an area to determine if a tornado has occurred. If a team is sent out, it will carry out a storm survey. The storm survey is the preliminary conclusions about the storm's severity and nature due to the damage left behind. Finally, it's up to a meteorologist to take all the data that has been shared and found in the storm survey and consult with other experts to give a final decision on what the tornado rating is. It could take hours or days to determine a rating, according to the National Weather Service. What does the EF rating for tornadoes mean? [The Enhanced Fujita scale](https://www.weather.gov/oun/efscale) is what the EF stands for in the ranking of tornadoes. The scale measures the strength of a tornado based on the damage it caused. Tornadoes are only rated after they've made their way through an area. Tornadoes rate from EF-0, which brings light damage, to EF-5 tornado which brings incredible damage. Where a tornado ranks is based on a list of damage indicators and degrees of damage, which help estimate the range of wind speeds the tornado likely produced, according to the National Weather Service. What is the EF scale for tornadoes? The EF scale is a set of wind estimates (not measurements) based on damage that is seen after a possible tornado has come through an area, according to the NWS. Here's how the EF rating and windspeeds correlate with one another. |EF category||Estimated windspeeds| |EF- 0||65-85 mph| |EF-1||86-110 mph| |EF-2||111-135 mph| |EF-3||136-165 mph| |EF-4||166-200 mph| |EF-5||Over 200 mph|",

The show, which features music and lyrics by Tony winner David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, a book by Tony winner Itamar Moses and direction by Tony winner David Cromer, begins performances at Broadway's Longacre Theatre on April 12 with the official opening set for April 27.\nDead Outlaw is about the bizarre true story of outlaw-turned-corpse-turned-celebrity Elmer McCurdy. As Elmer’s body finds even more outlandish adventures in death than it could have ever hoped for in life, the show explores fame, failure and the meaning—or, utter meaninglessness—of legacy. Dying is no reason to stop living life to its fullest.\nThe show had an extended run at Audible’s Minetta Lane Theatre last year. The cast of the off-Broadway run is set to reprise their roles on Broadway: Andrew Durand as Elmer McCurdy, Jeb Brown as Band Leader/Jarrett, Eddie Cooper as Coroner Johnson, Dashiell Eaves as Louis/Charles Patterson, Julia Knitel as Helen/Maggie, Ken Marks as George, Trent Saunders as Andy Payne and Thom Sesma as Coroner Noguchi, with Emily Fink and Max Sangerman as understudies.",

Esta acción podría haber eliminado las pruebas que los abogados del New York Times habían adquirido contra OpenAI.\nLa losa de la IA es que sus avances dependen de robar contenido\nLos gigantes tecnológicos no tienen reparos en utilizar material protegido por derechos de autor para entrenar distintos modelos de IA con diferentes conjuntos de datos. Ya hemos hablado anteriormente de cómo las empresas de IA no solo utilizaban datos textuales, [sino también vídeos de YouTube, incluidos vídeos de MKBHD, para entrenar sus modelos de IA.](https://www.softonic.com/articulos/un-youtuber-presenta-una-demanda-colectiva-contra-openai-por-robar-las-transcripciones-de-sus-videos)\nOpenAI accedió anteriormente a abrir su plataforma de IA para The New York Times y Daily News en un intento de que buscaran su propio material protegido por derechos de autor en los conjuntos de entrenamiento de IA.\nLos expertos de los editores dedicaron una gran cantidad de tiempo a curar los datos que OpenAI había utilizado para entrenar ChatGPT desde principios de noviembre. Y si bien las pruebas podrían haber respaldado las reclamaciones de los editores, OpenAI borró accidentalmente conjuntos de datos relevantes que se utilizaron para entrenar a ChatGPT.\nPor lo que hemos podido saber gracias a[ TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/openai-accidentally-deleted-potential-evidence-in-ny-times-copyright-lawsuit/), el 14 de noviembre, los ingenieros de OpenAI borraron todos los datos de búsqueda de los editores almacenados en una de las máquinas virtuales, según la carta antes mencionada, que fue presentada en el Tribunal de Distrito de EE.UU. para el Distrito Sur de Nueva York a última hora del miércoles.\nEn pocas palabras, se acusa a OpenAI de borrar las pruebas o investigaciones realizadas por los expertos de The New York Times.

Queda por ver cómo responderán los editores al percance y si alguna medida adicional en proyecto podría permitirles seguir adelante con sus reclamaciones.\nContent Manager - Periodista especializado en tecnología, entretenimiento y videojuegos.

    "text": "Некоторые Telegram-каналы сообщили о том, что в китайских гибридах и электромобилях зафиксировано излучение радиации выше нормы в восемь раз. Директор по сервису компании \"Рольф\" Юлия Трушкова рассказала \"Российской газете\", что бояться ничего не стоит. © РИА Новости \"Замеры в некоторых режимах показывают, что электромагнитное излучение в районе силовых кабелей и батарей гибридов может превышать санитарные нормы. Особенно это заметно при интенсивной зарядке или резком разгоне, когда силовая электроника работает на пределе.\nУ гибридных и электрических автомобилей есть электромагнитное поле - это физическое явление, которое нельзя \"выключить\". Оно возникает при работе:\n• тягового электродвигателя;\n• инвертора, который преобразует постоянный ток батареи в переменный для мотора;\n• высоковольтной проводки.\nПочему показатели иногда \"выше нормы\".\nПри замерах возле неэкранированных участков силовой линии (особенно рядом с инвертором или под полом у батареи) можно увидеть пиковые значения выше фоновых. Но:\n• Санитарные нормы предполагают, что человек находится в поле постоянно - в машине же воздействие кратковременное и нестабильное.\n• Большинство современных гибридов имеют многослойное экранирование проводки, ферритовые кольца на кабелях, металлические короба вокруг батарей - всё это сильно снижает излучение.\nПочему не стоит паниковать? Расстояние - лучший друг безопасности. Интенсивность поля падает пропорционально квадрату расстояния. Сиденье водителя обычно на 40-60 см от источника поля, а кабели проходят в экранированных каналах.\nНезависимые международные исследования (например, SAE, WHO, ICNIRP) не нашли убедительных доказательств, что излучения гибридов в реальных условиях опасны для здоровья.\nПриборы могут фиксировать \"высокие пики\", но они часто лежат в диапазоне частот, где ткань человека поглощает энергию крайне слабо.\nНо давайте вспомним, как мы реагировали на любую новую технику:\n• Первые телевизоры - экраны ставили в отдельную комнату, некоторые даже надевали \"защитные очки\".\n• Первые компьютерные мониторы - популярны были специальные светофильтры и \"экраны\" от излучения.\n• Мобильные телефоны - вокруг SAR-показателей появлялись целые страшилки, кто-то говорил \"не держите у головы дольше минуты\".\nСо временем наука ставила точки в этих вопросах: часть страхов оказывалась преувеличенной, часть - подтверждалась, но находились технические решения, которые делали технику безопаснее.\nСтрах \"всего нового\" - это скорее привычный механизм самосохранения, который мы видим уже десятки лет.\nА основная опасность в авто по-прежнему - не излучение, а скорость и невнимательность водителя\", - отметила эксперт.",
