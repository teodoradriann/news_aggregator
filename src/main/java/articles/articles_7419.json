    "text": "Premier LeaguArsenal-West Ham 0-2: colpo esterno degli Hammers con Soucek e Mavropanos, i Gunners perdono il primato PREMIER LEAGUE - L'Arsenal manca il controsorpasso al Liverpool e scivola al secondo posto. La squadra di Arteta tiene in mano il possesso palla, ma un West Ham concreto e spietato trova il colpo esterno all'Emirates Stadium. Soucek nel primo tempo e Mavropanos nella ripresa affondano i Gunners. I Gunners fanno la partita fin dai primi minuti, ma gli Hammers sono più pratici e sfruttano l’unica occasione creata nel primo tempo per andare in vantaggio, quando Soucek tocca in rete un assist di Bowen. Saka viene fermato dal palo prima dell’intervallo, poi Mavropanos indirizza il match di testa in avvio di ripresa. L'assalto dell'Arsenal non manca e Gabriel Jesus ha le occasioni per riaprire la sfida, nel finale Raya para un rigore ed evita quantomeno il tris. Il Tabellino ARSENAL-WEST HAM 0-2 ARSENAL (4-3-3): Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko (64’Zinchenko); Odegaard, Rice, Trossard (78’Smith-Rowe); Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Martinelli (64’Nketiah) WEST HAM (4-2-3-1): Areola; Coufal, Mavropanos, Ogbonna, Emerson Palmeri; Alvarez, Soucek; Kudus, Ward-Prowse, Paqueta (33’Benrahma); Bowen WEST HAM (4-2-3-1): Areola; Coufal, Mavropanos, Ogbonna, Emerson Palmeri; Alvarez, Soucek; Kudus, Ward-Prowse, Paqueta (33’Benrahma); Bowen GOL: 13’ Soucek, 55’ Mavropanos ASSIST: Bowen, Ward-Prowse La cronaca in 7 momenti chiave 13’- SOUCEK! VANTAGGIO WEST HAM! Pasticcio difensivo della difesa di casa, nasce tutto da un cross di EMERSON, incomprensione tra i difensori dell'Arsenal e palla che torna buona a fondo campo per BOWEN. Assist al centro per SOUCEK che da due passi tocca in rete. 30’- OCCASIONE ARSENAL! GABRIEL JESUS alza per SAKA nel cuore dell'area, colpo di testa parato d'istinto da AREOLA. 42’- PALO PIENO DI SAKA! Filtrante di ODEGAARD, SAKA si presenta davanti ad AREOLA in zona primo palo e colpisce il legno. 55’- MAVROPANOS! Stacco imperioso e colpo di testa splendido che tocca la traversa e si infila in rete. 2-0 clamoroso per gli Hammers. 66’- ANCORA JESUS! Questa volta è un grosso errore. Palla perfetta dalla destra di WHITE, Jesus sul secondo palo è libero di colpire di testa ma alza troppo la mira. 95'- CALCIO DI RIGORE PER IL WEST HAM! RICE falcia nettamente EMERSON. 96'- RAYA PARA IL RIGORE! Esecuzione a mezza altezza di BENRAHMA e tuffo vincente del portiere.

    "text": "Bishop Delton Fernander has been elected the 12th president of the Bahamas National Baptist Missionary and Educational Convention (BBMEC). Fernander, who is also Bahamas Christian Council (BCC) president (through 2026) and is senior pastor at New Destiny Baptist Cathedral, was voted in during early called elections held on Wednesday, May 29, during the 89th convention of the BBMEC. He received 54 percent of the votes, beating out Bishop Carrington Pinder who polled 30 percent of the votes and Reverend Dr. Philip McPhee who received only 16 percent of the votes. McPhee was seeking to retain a leadership he inherited in 2023 after the death of the sitting president Reverend Lloyd Smith. “I ran for this position, not to pad my resumé, but to do my part in restoring the Convention,” said Fernander in a press release. “As a follower of Jesus Christ, and a proud Baptist, I understand and accept that now was the time to revive, repair and restore this convention before it be too late.” Ahead of the elections the new president released a five-point focus for the term to be achieve with the broadest participation possible. “We will rebrand our convention to reflect the dynamic contribution Baptist have made to our country; we will harness the skills of laypeople in our denomination to assist in strengthening our schools, college and other institutions; we will rebuild our convention headquarters at its former location on Baillou Hill Road; we will cultivate relationships with Baptists internationally for the benefits of Bahamian Baptists; we will revive our churches to fulfill the mandate set out in the Bible and to positively impact our communities.” Fernander said he can vividly recall the glory days of the Convention and its reach and influence in the nation. “The efforts of the great cadre of men and women who sacrificed to build this organization should not be diminished and cannot be lost,” he said. The 12th BBMEC president said Baptists must use the foundation inherited from those who built the Convention to rebuild it in a way that is sustainable and will live on far beyond this generation. Fernander thanked the delegates who “reposed their confidence” in him to lead the historic organization. “This new journey begins at a critical time in the history of the Convention. We have reached an inflection point where positive change is necessary to ensure that the organization along with its history, assets, and future potential are preserved and strengthened,” he said. A day after he assumed office, Fernander called on all Baptist churches, associations and Christians at large to come together and join in what he referred to as a “period of repair and restoration” – and not only in his denomination but the country at large. He said The Bahamas needs people who are prepared and knowledgeable to step forward to serve and develop the nation and its institutions and organizations. “The work ahead will not be easy, but with God’s guidance, we will move steadily forward in the right direction,” said Fernander. The new BBMEC president holds the BCC presidency through 2026.",

    "text": "At the Première Vision Paris trade show, held at the Villepinte exhibition centre on July 2-4, the Alliance for European Flax-Linen & Hemp said that a record harvest is expected this year, after several tough years for flax growers.\nMG/FNW A scutching cooperative in the Neubourg region of Normandy, France - MG/FNW\nThe flax grubbing-up process is about to start in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, and the industry is forecasting that this year's harvest could produce an average of 6 to 7 tons of bast per hectare. An output that had not been reached since 2019.\nAds Linen fibre will be extracted from this bast, the inner section of the flax stem. It remains to be seen how much in terms of long fibres, those used for textile production, will be yielded after the scutching stage next autumn. The industry is optimistic, having sounded the alarm last year about the effects of climate change on output, which was halved in 2023 .\nThere is also the possibility of harvesting winter flax, planted in late autumn rather than in spring, with 30,000 hectares devoted to this crop. Land that “produces a slightly lower yield in some regions,” said the Alliance, whose members are currently seeking to identify the best species for these off-season crops.\nCrop data is closely monitored by fabric manufacturers and fashion labels. In March, the average price of European Flax fibre (the Alliance’s trademark), calculated across all types and regions, was €9.08 per kg, up 55% over the previous year, having been affected by a poor harvest.\nThe industry is hoping that the current harvest will generate a larger output at more regular prices. This year, 180,000 hectares of land in Europe were dedicated to flax cultivation, a 20% increase year-on-year, for a total area that is 10% higher than the previous record in 2020 .\nCopyright © 2024 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.",

We're here to help you sift through it all.\nUsing FanDuel Research's daily NBA projections as a guide, here are some NBA player prop bets that look appealing on FanDuel.\nPlease note: lines and projections are subject to change throughout the day after this article is published. All NBA odds come from FanDuel Sportsbook.\nToday's Best NBA Player Prop Picks\nPhoenix Suns at Washington Wizards\nTyus Jones 2+ Made Threes (-145) / 3+ Made Threes (+210)\nBradley Beal (ankle) is listed as doubtful for tonight's competition against the Washington Wizards. His absence should allow Tyus Jones -- whose minutes have been down -- to reclaim a meatier role. That's just one of the reasons why I like Jones' made threes prop tonight.\nJones is averaging 2.1 three-point makes (3PM) for the season. He's made at least two threes in 57.9% of games and has nailed three triples in 36.8% of games -- up from the 32.3% implied probability on these +210 odds.\nWashington serves as the easiest matchup in basketball. They rank fourth in pace and dead-last in defensive rating. They're also coughing up the most three-point attempts (40.4) per game.\nJones is netting 2.2 3PM and has made at least two threes in 66.7% of games versus top-10 pace teams. When playing a bottom-10 defense, Jones has made two threes at a 66.7% rate and three three-pointers at a cushy 55.6% rate.\nIn 10 games without Beal this season, Jones averaged 2.7 3PM on 32.2 minutes. He made two threes in 80.0% of the games in the split and drained three threes in 50.0% of those contests. With Beal's absence colliding with the soft matchup, this could end up being a fruitful night for Jones.\nLos Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\nJames Harden Over 35.5 Pts + Reb + Ast (-113)\nJames Harden played only 23 minutes in last night's 59-point rout over the Brooklyn Nets, but he still managed to tally 38 combined points, rebounds, and assists (PRA) in his abridged appearance. I like him to hover around that PRA range again in tonight's contest against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nHarden is averaging 35.4 PRA. He's been extra special against weak competition and seems primed to ravage Portland's 27th-ranked defense.\nHere's a look at Harden's PRA output versus the bottom 10 defenses in the NBA: 38, 33, 48, 31, 54, 37, 48, 34, 49, and 43 PRA. In the split, he has averaged 41.5 PRA and cleared 35.5 PRA at a 70.0% rate. Even his floor in this sample (31 PRA) is encouraging.\nJames Harden - Pts + Reb + Ast\nThe Blazers let up the seventh-most points, eighth-most assists, and 12th-most rebounds per game. The road Clippers are favored by just 7.0 points, putting Harden in a spot to get decent run as there isn't a ton of blowout risk. Notably, 13 of Harden's last 25 games have been decided by at least 20 points, yet he's still managed to consistently stuff the stat sheet.\nThe kicker? Portland surrenders the 10th-most free throw attempts per game and the fourth-most FT attempts on their home court. Unsurprisingly, Harden shoots the sixth-most charity stripe attempts in the league.\nHere's a look at his PRA output against clubs that rank in the top eight of most free throws allowed: 43, 38, 54, 38, 31, 37, 36, 37, and 34 PRA. That's good for a 38.7 PRA average and a 77.8% hit rate on the over at this line.\nCleveland Cavaliers at Oklahoma City Thunder\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander to Record 6+ Assists (-125)\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander is converting potential assists to the stat sheet at the lowest rate in the NBA (among eligible players).\nWhile he's netting 6.0 dimes per game, he should be averaging 7.0 assists based on the league average conversion rate. Positive regression could be forthcoming, so I like him to dish out at least six assists in tonight's marquee game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThe Cavs come in with the eighth-best defensive rating. SGA has played 12 games against top-eight defenses. In this split, he's averaging 6.3 dimes and has notched at least six assists in 66.7% of games.\nCleveland surrenders the 10th-most assists per game to guards. Both Cleveland (6th) and OKC (8th) play at a quick pace, leaving us with a slate-high 233.0 over/under.\nThere should be a lot of points to go around, and Cleveland has top defensive guards who will look to turn SGA into a passer.\nOur NBA projections expect SGA to dish out 6.5 dimes in this one.\nGet a [No Sweat Token](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/nba?ampSessionId=1737042091444&DeviceId=97f43a98-a0eb-4590-b07c-8d731f5f599b&SessionId=undefined&DeviceId=undefined) to use on a 3+ leg SGP wager on either of the NBA on TNT games happening tonight, January 16th!
