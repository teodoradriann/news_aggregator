    "title": "Reagan-appointed judge warns GOP's 'preposterous' claims about Jan. 6 could pose threat",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — A Republican-appointed federal judge who has served on the bench for 37 years slammed prominent politicians for their \\\"preposterous\\\" claims about how the courts have handled Jan. 6 cases and attempts to \\\"rewrite history\\\" about the U.S. Capitol attack, saying such rhetoric could foreshadow future far-right violence. Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, appointed to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, said during a resentencing hearing on Thursday that he is \\\"shocked\\\" at how prominent political figures have talked about the convicted criminals who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, calling the politicians' remarks \\\"preposterous\\\" and warning that such rhetoric \\\"could presage further danger to our country.\\\" While Lamberth did not refer to the politicians by name, he used quotes that came from Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga. (who said rioters behaved \\\"in an orderly fashion\\\" like tourists), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. (who called Jan. 6 inmates \\\"political prisoners\\\"), and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., (who, echoing former President Donald Trump, called Jan. 6 criminals \\\"hostages\\\"). In 2022, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution referring to the events of Jan. 6 as \\\"legitimate political discourse.\\\" \\\"The Court is accustomed to defendants who refuse to accept that they did anything wrong. But in my thirty-seven years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream,\\\" Lamberth said, according to his prepared remarks. \\\"I have been dismayed to see distortions and outright falsehoods seep into the public consciousness,” Lamberth continued before issuing a stark warning: \\\"The Court fears that such destructive, misguided rhetoric could presage further danger to our country.\\\" Lamberth, a former Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps captain who served in Vietnam, said he could not \\\"condone the shameless attempts\\\" to misrepresent what happened on Jan. 6. The court, he said, \\\"cannot condone the notion that those who broke the law on January 6 did nothing wrong, or that those duly convicted with all the safeguards of the United States Constitution, including a right to trial by jury in felony cases, are political prisoners or hostages.\\\" Lamberth then made an effort to \\\"set the record straight, based on what I’ve learned presiding over many January 6 prosecutions, hearing from dozens of witnesses, watching hundreds of hours of video footage, and reading thousands of pages of evidence.\\\" \\\"On January 6, 2021, a mob of people invaded and occupied the United States Capitol, using force to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power mandated by the Constitution and our republican heritage,\\\" he said. \\\"The rioters interfered with a necessary step in the constitutional process, disrupted the lawful transfer of power, and thus jeopardized the American constitutional order. ... This was not patriotism; it was the antithesis of patriotism.\\\" Lamberth went on to say it was \\\"a matter of right and wrong,\\\" and that it fell to judges to say that the actions of those who broke the law on Jan. 6 were wrong. \\\"The Court does not expect its remarks to fully stem the tide of falsehoods. But I hope a little truth will go a long way,\\\" he said. More than 1,250 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to the Department of Justice. More than 700 defendants have entered voluntary guilty pleas, meaning that they appeared before judges and admitted under penalty of perjury that they had, in fact, engaged in criminal activity on Jan. 6, per DOJ. Just this week, Edward Richmond Jr. of Louisiana, who was previously convicted of voluntary manslaughter for killing an Iraqi civilian while deployed overseas, was arrested and charged with assaulting law enforcement officers at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Richmond, federal authorities say, used a baton to assault law enforcement officers battling rioters at the lower west tunnel, where some of the most extreme violence of the day took place. Richmond will plead not guilty, John McLindon, an attorney for his son, said. Federal authorities on Tuesday also arrested Andy Steven Oliva-Lopez, who was identified by online sleuths as the man who was photographed and recorded using chemical spray to assault law enforcement officers at the west tunnel on Jan. 6, according to the FBI. It is unclear whether Oliva-Lopez has entered a plea.",

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "Jerusalem Patriarch Appeals to Netanyahu",
    "text": "The Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem Archbishop Nourhan Manougian on Thursday sent a letter of appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel calling for his intervention to stop the threat of foreclosure on the Armenian Patriarchate property.\nThe Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced on Wednesday that the Patriarchate’s historic properties were under imminent threat of foreclosure by municipal officials for allegedly failing to pay taxes since 1994, a claim church officials vehemently deny.\nArchbishop Manougian reportedly implored Netanyahu to intervene in the matter, ahead of a scheduled court hearing on Monday, according to the Patriarchate’s Chancellor Very Reverent Aghan Gogchyan. The official said that the Patriarchate called for reconvening of a meeting of the government committee, which was founded by Netanyahu himself and “find a solution for the issue.”\n“If the court rejects the Patriarchate’s appeal on February 24, 2025, the Municipality will seize and auction Armenian Church properties it has owned for centuries,” Gogchyan said in a statement.\nReligious leaders of other denominations in Jerusalem issued a joint statement on Thursday expressing their solidarity with the Armenian Patriarchate in what they said the “pursuit of justice against an unjust foreclosure order issued by the Municipality of Jerusalem,” and condemned the threats to foreclose on the Patriarchate’s properties.\n“The actions taken against the Arminian Patriarchate, based on an unverified and exorbitant Arnona Tax debt, are legally dubious and morally unacceptable,” the signatories said.\n“It is inconceivable that Christian institutions, whose mission for centuries has been to safeguard faith, serve communities, and preserve the sacred heritage of the Holy Land, should now face the threat of property seizure under Israeli administrative measures that disregard due process. Particularly alarming is the municipality’s attempt to enforce a debt determination without judicial scrutiny, and in defiance of the governmental committee established to negotiate such matters in good faith. This reckless move jeopardizes the Orthodox Armenian Patriarchate and sets a perilous precedent that could imperil Christian institutions throughout the Holy Land,” the statement said.\nThey noted that this action “undermines the freedom of religion, which is the foundation of all other rights, since through a confiscation of assets, attempts to the right of existence of the Orthodox Armenian Church, depriving it of the necessary economic resources to live and operate and depriving the local Armenian people of the pastoral care of their Church.”\n“The targeting of one Church is an assault on all, and we cannot remain silent while the foundations of our Christian witness in the land of Christ’s ministry are shaken. We call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel, and Minister Tzachi Hanegbi to immediately intervene, freeze all foreclosure proceedings, and ensure that negotiations resume within the above-mentioned governmental committee in order to reach to an amicable solution regarding this issue in the spirit of justice,” the statement read.",

    "text": "En prisión preventiva quedó el ciudadano extranjero que ingresó a nuestro país por un paso clandestino desde Bolivia portando artefactos explosivos. Una segunda persona quedó detenida por este procedimiento.\nEste jueves se formalizó al imputado extranjero que ingresó por un paso clandestino desde Bolivia a Chile portando artefactos explosivos, además de arrojos metálicos, conocidos como miguelitos . La Fiscalía de Arica logró la prisión preventiva para el acusado, mientras que también se detuvo a un segundo individuo decretándose la ampliación de su detención a la espera de establecer su identidad y nacionalidad.\nDe acuerdo con los antecedentes presentados por la fiscal Ingrid Castro durante la audiencia de formalización, el incidente ocurrió cerca de las 19 horas del miércoles. En ese momento, funcionarios de Carabineros del Retén Chilcaya, ubicado en la comuna de Putre, detectaron a los dos imputados que se desplazaban en un vehículo en sentido contrario por la ruta A-257. Se determinó que habían ingresado al país por un paso clandestino.\nEn ese contexto, se les realizó un control de identidad, durante el cual se detectó que en el asiento trasero del vehículo había un bolso. Al examinar su contenido, se encontraron doce artefactos explosivos, de los cuales once mantenían una mecha detonante. Además, se hallaron un total de 88 elementos metálicos denominados miguelitos y otro bolso que contenía cuatro equipos de radio portátil, junto con una cantidad de dinero en efectivo (11.620 bolivianos).\nEn el caso del imputado D.C.C., fue formalizado por los delitos de infracción a la Ley de Control de Armas y por portar instrumentos destinados para cometer delitos de robo , quedando bajo la medida cautelar de prisión preventiva. Mientras tanto, se amplió por 48 horas la detención del otro sujeto a la espera de establecer su identidad. Se fijó un plazo de investigación de 90 días.",

    "text": "La nueva era de energía renovable ya ha comenzado Naturgy se prepara para liderar la transición energética en España, posicionando el biometano como pieza clave en la reducción de emisiones La compañía energética, plenamente comprometida con el desarrollo sostenible, está enfocando gran parte de sus esfuerzos en impulsar las energías renovables para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Esta misma lucha contra el cambio climático también se refleja en su firme apuesta por la protección de la biodiversidad a través de proyectos que buscan conservar y restaurar espacios naturales clave. Durante el año pasado llevó a cabo 353 iniciativas para preservar el capital natural y avanzar hacia un equilibrio entre su actividad y el entorno. Estas acciones, junto con las nuevas implementadas en 2024, están orientadas en un 22% a la protección de hábitats y especies protegidas; un esfuerzo que se alinea con el compromiso voluntario asumido por la compañía en el Acuerdo de París para ser un actor clave en la transición energética hacia un modelo de economía circular y descarbonizado. Asimismo, se ha comprometido a ser neutra en carbono para 2050, reduciendo el total de emisiones de CO₂ de alcance 1, 2 y 3, en línea con los objetivos del Acuerdo de París que buscan limitar el aumento de la temperatura global a menos de 2 grados y, a ser posible, a 1,5 grados. Plan de Sostenibilidad a 2025 Con un modelo de negocio enfocado en el desarrollo sostenible de la sociedad, la multinacional creó en el año 2020 la Comisión de Sostenibilidad dentro de su Consejo de Administración; un movimiento pionero, que solo unas pocas empresas habían realizado hasta la fecha y que refleja su esfuerzo por liderar el camino hacia un futuro responsable. El nuevo organismo nació con el propósito de visibilizar su compromiso ambiental, social y de gobernanza, haciendo especial hincapié en la batalla climática. La comisión, además, es la encargada de velar por el cumplimiento de los objetivos del Plan de Sostenibilidad. De cara a 2025, Naturgy ha establecido un sólido plan que se basa en seis palancas estratégicas y abarca 21 líneas de acción con un total de 70 objetivos concretos. El plan se alinea con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) de la Agenda 2030 y establece distintas metas, como alcanzar una potencia instalada de fuentes renovables cercana al 48% para 2025. Hasta ahora, en el primer semestre de 2024, la compañía ha logrado que más del 40% de su capacidad instalada sea libre de emisiones, consiguiendo reducir la intensidad de las mismas en un 10%. Desde 2017, Naturgy ha realizado avances significativos, logrando disminuir sus emisiones directas de gases de efecto invernadero en un 39%, así como el consumo de agua en un 39% y la intensidad de CO₂ en la generación de electricidad en un 36%. Este enfoque proactivo manifiesta el compromiso de la empresa con la sostenibilidad y subraya su papel como agente de cambio en la transición hacia un futuro sostenible. De hecho, los principales índices que miden el desempeño en materia de ASG (Ambiental, Social y de Gobernanza), posicionan a Naturgy entre el 2% de las empresas más sostenibles del sector Utilities a nivel mundial. La compañía ha consolidado su posición de liderazgo en el índice FTSE4GOOD, reconocido internacionalmente, obteniendo la máxima puntuación en biodiversidad, condiciones de trabajo, seguridad y salud, gestión de riesgos, gobierno corporativo y transparencia fiscal. Su destacada actuación en ASG también ha sido reconocida con la medalla de Oro de Ecovadis, situándola entre el 5% de las empresas mejor valoradas del panorama internacional. “Este reconocimiento avala las actuaciones que desde Naturgy estamos llevando a cabo para ser un actor clave en la transición energética. Así, hemos adoptado medidas urgentes para combatir el cambio climático y sus efectos, prueba de ello es que durante el pasado año redujimos nuestra huella de carbono total en un 30% respecto a 2017”, comenta la directora de Medioambiente y Responsabilidad Social de Naturgy, Nuria Rodríguez. Desde 2017, Naturgy ha logrando disminuir sus emisiones directas de gases de efecto invernadero en un 39%, así como el consumo de agua en un 39% y la intensidad de CO₂ en la generación de electricidad en un 36% Biometano, clave para la descarbonización Si hay algo en lo que está poniendo especial empeño la energética española, es su apuesta por las energías renovables y minimizar su impacto ambiental. La empresa viene definiendo su acción desde hace tiempo en torno al uso racional de recursos y a la incorporación de nuevas tecnologías y procesos a través de la innovación. Su estrategia para seguir creciendo en energías sostenibles ha conseguido ya una cartera renovable que suma 6,5 GW de potencia operativa. El papel de las compañías energéticas hacia un modelo sostenible es fundamental; y Naturgy, como principal actor en esta transformación, quiere ofrecer una respuesta sensata y equilibrada, una alternativa de energía que garantice un suministro de calidad y sin interrupciones, a precios asequibles, facilitando así una transición justa y eficaz. Para lograrlo, seguirá centrada en los gases renovables, así como en la generación eólica y fotovoltaica. En este contexto, el gas renovable, obtenido a partir del tratamiento de residuos urbanos, agrícolas, ganaderos y aguas residuales, es esencial para avanzar en la descarbonización del sector energético. Para liderar el impulso de esta energía, Naturgy está concentrada tanto en la producción y distribución de biometano en el corto plazo, como en el desarrollo del hidrógeno verde en el medio plazo, este último generado a partir de electricidad renovable y agua. Al aprovechar la infraestructura de gas natural existente, el biometano puede distribuirse y utilizarse en hogares, industrias, comercios y transporte. Esto contribuye a la transición justa y promueve la economía circular. Por tanto, este gas renovable no solo ayuda a diversificar las fuentes de energía, sino que se convierte en una opción sostenible para el futuro energético de España.
