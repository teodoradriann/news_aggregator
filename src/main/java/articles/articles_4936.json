    "text": "Paris Olympics: Andy Murray withdraws from men's singles tennis F ormer World No. 1 Andy Murray has withdrawn from the men's singles event at the Paris Olympics. The two-time Olympic gold medallist, who is retiring from professional tennis following the conclusion of this year's Games, will partner Dan Evans in the men's doubles tournament as he bids to go out on a high with his third Olympic medal. \"I've take the decision to withdraw from the singles to concentrate on the doubles with Dan,\" Murray said in a statement confirming his withdrawal.\" \"Our practice has been great and we're playing well together. Really looking forward to getting started and representing GB one more time,\" he added. The Briton bagged his first Olympic singles gold in the 2012 London Olympics, where he defeated Swiss legend Roger Federer in straight games. In Rio 2016 Games, he became the first male tennis player to win two Olympic singles gold medals, when he beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro. ✔️ Paris Olympics: Andy Murray withdraws from men's singles tennis 💕 Found this article helpful?

    "text": "Commentary\nArticle\nAuthor(s):\nA professional's battle with alcoholism escalated from social drinking to daily dependence, impacting work and relationships until a pivotal moment led to seeking rehab and recovery.\nIn an interview with Psychiatric Times, Christopher L. Schenewerk, MD discussed his history with alcoholism and his experiences before entering rehab in 2018.\nHe said that historically, he had been a social drinker and was usually a very social person. “It wasn’t until I turned 40, when I went through a divorce… that I realized I thought I was prepared for anything in life and apparently I wasn’t,” Schenewerk said. He said the social drinking slowly became daily drinking and began destroying his life. He knew what to do and how to treat addiction but did not know how to treat himself or recognize his addiction.\n“I would self-justify that I didn’t have a problem because I didn’t drink at work, I didn’t drink before I went to work, I didn’t drink when I was on call, so I could control it,” Schenewerk said. He pointed out that if he was drinking 4 bottles of wine a night and up until 2 AM, he was legally intoxicated most likely every day he went to work during that time.\nScenewerk said addiction is a disease of insanity, of “unrelenting, continuous poor choices.” “That shame and guilt is what makes you drink about 2 hours afterwards,” he said. Drinking became a matter of survival and impacted his work until his closest advocates noticed something was wrong.\nIn his last week before entering rehab, a conversation brought him back to himself and he decided to seek help. He took a day off work to study for his 10 year boards, which he said was worthless due to not putting any time in. “My wife was sitting at the edge of the bed and she said, ‘I’m afraid you’re gonna die. You need to go to rehab.’” He said he argued a little bit, but something inside happened and he made the decision that he needed help.\nThis is part 2 of a 3 part series. You can watch the full interview here.\nDr Schenewerk is a family medicine physician and is the medical director at Illinois Recovery Center.",

    "text": "Over a dozen Oklahoma colleges and universities request tuition hikes\nOver half of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities on Wednesday asked a state governing board to approve increases in what students must pay in tuition and fees for the upcoming school year.\nMark Tygret, vice chancellor for budget and finance for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said the average tuition and fee increase request across institutions was 1.9% which equates to just over $121 for undergraduate resident students enrolled in 30 credit hours.\nIn all, 15 institutions are seeking increases while 10 did not request any boosts in tuition or fees, including Oklahoma State University, which will be its sixth year without an increase.\nThe state regents are expected to vote Thursday to approve or deny the requests.\nMany presidents attributed the need for increases to inflation, rising health insurance costs and a desire to provide cost of living raises for faculty and staff.\nUniversity leaders also highlighted the ways they’ve tried to cut costs in other places before requesting increases in tuition or fees. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a press conference earlier this month that he didn’t think tuition increases were necessary as Oklahoma hasn’t seen “all of the efficiency out of our universities.”\nTuition or fee increases were requested from:\n- University of Oklahoma\n- East Central University\n- Northeastern State University\n- Northwestern Oklahoma State University\n- Southeastern Oklahoma State University\n- Southwestern Oklahoma State University\n- University of Central Oklahoma\n- Langston University\n- Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College\n- Connors State College\n- Western Oklahoma State College\n- Oklahoma City Community College\n- Rose State College\n- Seminole State College\n- Murray State College\nThe Oklahoma Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state Regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year.\nOU President Joseph Harroz said he’s requesting an increase to keep up with inflation and universities in Texas and Florida that receive more legislative performance-based funding.\nHe requested a 3% increase, which raises costs about $294 for a full-time student.\n“You’ve seen me up here the last three years, and under our strategic plan … that request will be coming again next year and the following year, with the same goals,” Harroz said of requesting an increase again.\nWhile OU’s “sticker price” for tuition has risen 12% since the 2019 fiscal year, the average amount actually paid by students is down 27% in the same time period when factoring in financial assistance, Harroz said.\nA 2.6% increase, totaling a $225.90 change, was requested by UCO President Todd Lamb.\nThe university is continuing to recover from a budget deficit, and if approved this increase could bring the school close to closing the gap completely, he said.\nThe Edmond school is the third-largest university in the state, but third to last in funding, Lamb said.\nOklahoma’s only historically Black university, Langston University, requested a 3% increase.\nLangston President Ruth Ray Jackson said the revenue generated will provide funding for capital projects spurred by weather-related damage, deferred maintenance and help with inflation.\nThe increase to tuition and fees would cost the average student just over $207.\nOklahoma City Community College President Mautra Jones asked the state regents to approve an 8% increase, the highest boost sought by any institution.\nWhile Jones said the request may seem steep, the community college kept tuition flat for seven years. Even if the increase were approved, the college would remain “within pennies” of being the lowest cost institution in the state, she said.\nThe increase equates to $323.10 for the average student.\nOklahoma Voice is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
