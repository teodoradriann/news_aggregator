    "title": "SFIA: World Cup, Olympics will boost U.S. sports participation",
    "text": "At Licensing International’s recent summit in NYC, SFIA Senior Director of Business Operations and Research Alex Kerman offered a number of predictions as an addendum to the organization’s industry-standard participation data.\nSFIA’s crystal ball forecast the following:\n- With growing support from the NFL and participation in the 2028 L.A. Olympics as accelerators, flag football (especially girls) is the fastest-growing high school sport, with championships across all 50 states (33 will have them in 2025; 13 has them last year). There is also the eventual status as an NCAA sport. “We’re very bullish, and there’s lots of investment coming,” said Kerman. “For tackle football, the vast majority of participants in high school are boys. For flag, the vast majority in high school are girls.”\n- “The 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics will boost U.S. sports participation and [sports] business growth,” Kerman said.\n- The fastest growing sports overall (see chart) were led by pickleball, which has grown an astounding 311% over the past three years, and is growing across all age groups and is “not just a fad, but a lifetime sport,” according to Kerman. However, racket sports in general are healthy, with tennis (No. 7) and padel are also picking up speed, and overall racquet sports up a leading 9.4%. “We’re bullish on padel becoming the fastest growing sport overall in three to five years.”\n- Pro leagues in women’s softball, volleyball, lacrosse and hockey will drive grassroots participation, as will the six sports to be introduced/reintroduced in the 2028 Olympics -- baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse, softball and squash.\nKerman added that tariffs’ impact on sports participation will likely be uneven. The “high equipment costs will impact participation unevenly,” he said.",

    "title": "Top Stories of 2023: Volunteers Serve, Seniors Thrive at Faith in Action | Williamsburg Yorktown Daily",
    "text": "Editor’s Note — As part of our countdown to 2024, WYDaily is revisiting its most-read and favorite stories of the year. Reporter Stephanie Sabin said she chose this story because she enjoys covering area nonprofit organizations and learning about all the resources available to the community. She said she especially enjoyed this story since she was able to speak with so many different people involved in different ways throughout Faith in Action. The Williamsburg Faith in Action Senior Benefit was held on Sunday, June 25 at Frothy Moon. The event was well received and the community support was in abundance. WILLIAMSBURG — “Volunteers serve. Seniors thrive,” is the mission of Williamsburg Faith in Action, a local nonprofit agency that focuses on allowing citizens of James City County aged 60 years and older to stay independent. The organization has been around since 2002 and operates through a network of volunteers, many over the age of 60 themselves. [Faith in Action](https://wjv.230.mwp.accessdomain.com/) provides transportation and other support services within the community to approximately 150 active care receivers. Retired Director of Riverside Center for Excellence in Aging and Lifelong Health and current Faith in Action Chairman of the Board Rick Jackson says the purpose of the organization is to prolong the ability of older adults to remain in their own homes. Assistance is provided free of charge to those in need that meet the criteria when manpower is available. “Caregiving services can be very expensive and without our volunteers, many of the people we serve simply could not stay in their own homes,” said Jackson. In addition to providing trips to the doctor or delivering groceries, Jackson says, the group sees a vulnerable population that deals with isolation. “Older adults who become isolated are at greater risk of depression, falls and other things that can affect their independence. So, we not only provide an essential service, we provide companionship,” Jackson continues, “To see the light in a person’s eye, to know that without you they are alone and isolated and not getting the essential tools they need to remain independent in the community.” COVID-19 made Faith in Action rethink how it could assist those in need. Food security became a focus, with volunteers delivering food. As restrictions have lifted, Caitlynn Butcher, Program Services Administrator, says that in addition to food services, many are in need of medical transportation. The agency wants to expand its services, however, it needs more volunteers. “In the past, we were able to offer additional services and more one-on-one visits,” adds Butcher, “There are so many needs. We want to serve the whole person; physical and social. That is part of what makes this program so special. If someone lives alone, not only will they get a ride to the doctor but, also socialization.” Butcher said, “90% of our volunteers are seniors themselves. We have volunteers in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and even their 90s. We have many long-term volunteers that have worked with us for many years, too. It is very unique.” “Many of our volunteers are older adults who have retired from work. They want to still have meaning in their lives and have a positive impact on the community. These are people who have the time and the wherewithal to sign up and provide these extremely valuable services,” states Jackson. At 93 years of age, one may think Ruth McMahon is the care receiver, but they would be wrong. McMahon has been an active volunteer for Faith in Action for 20 years. McMahon says she loves to help others and will continue to give back as long as she is able. “I don’t do as much now that I am older,” McMahon said, “but, if you can help someone else, then that is just the right thing to do. I feel wonderful being able to help people and it gives me a lot of satisfaction.” Faith in Action relies heavily on community awareness to let those in the area know the organization exists for those with needs as well as to get the word out about volunteering and financial support. [Frothy Moon Brewhouse](https://wydaily.com/brews-and-bites/2023/04/18/frothy-moon-enters-orbit-phase/) will be hosting a benefit bash to support Faith in Action on Sunday, June 25 from 1-5 p.m. Live music will be provided by Scott Varney and local band, London. Community members are invited to come out and learn more about the programs and volunteer opportunities offered by Faith in Action. Volunteers do not have to be retired or a senior, Faith in Action finds as little as 30 minutes a week can be put to use helping someone. The organization asks that anyone interested fill out a [volunteer application](https://wjv.230.mwp.accessdomain.com/volunteers/). “Without our volunteers, this organization could not exist. All of the accolades and recognition goes to them!” Butcher said.",

    "text": "8月13号，禾赛公众号发布“2025上半年主激光雷达出货量第一”推文，称根据盖世汽车研究院的数据，禾赛以284399的主激光雷达装机量位居第一，华为以260236紧随其后。\n　　然而，这一发布在激光雷达行业讨论群内产生质疑，禾赛发布的推文图片与盖世网站图片不符，有网友质疑是否禾赛修改了榜单图片。\n　　（禾赛微信公众号截图）\n　　在雪球社区中，有网友发出了盖世官网原版与禾赛微信公众号版本的区别：盖世统计包含主激光雷达和补盲雷达，而禾赛的图未区分补盲雷达数量，且华为和盖世官方均未公布补盲雷达具体数量，数据计算逻辑成谜。\n　　通过查询盖世官网发布的激光雷达供应商装机量排行榜，对比1-5月数据以及1-6月数据，可以计算得出华为在6月份仅装机530台雷达，这与头部激光雷达供应商单月普遍5~6万台的数字差距过大，成为网友主要质疑点。\n　　（雪球网友制作图片）\n　　（盖世官网发布的1-5月数据）\n　　截止发稿，禾赛及盖世方面均没有进一步的信息发布。有网友认为这是一贯操作，并不值得惊讶，“别当真，都是给股民看的”。\n　　据禾赛科技官网，禾赛科技是全球领先的激光雷达研发与制造企业，产品广泛应用于支持高级辅助驾驶系统（ADAS）的乘用车和商用车，以及自动驾驶汽车和配送机器人、移动机器人等各类机器人应用。据公开资料，禾赛科技2014年成立，2023年2月登陆美国纳斯达克上市；2024年初，禾赛在美国被列入国防部黑名单；2025年3月，美国做空机构蓝鲸资本发布报告质疑禾赛科技盈利真实性和法律风险；2025年7月美国哥伦比亚特区法院驳回禾赛对制裁的诉讼，维持制裁。\n特别提醒：本网信息来自于互联网，目的在于传递更多信息，并不代表本网赞同其观点。其原创性以及文中陈述文字和内容未经本站证实，对本文以及其中全部或者部分内容、文字的真实性、完整性、及时性本站不作任何保证或承诺，并请自行核实相关内容。本站不承担此类作品侵权行为的直接责任及连带责任。如若本网有任何内容侵犯您的权益，请及时联系我们，本站将会在24小时内处理完毕。",

    "text": "In anticipation of the significant demand for the consecration ceremony of the newly built Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the Ambala Division of Railways has revealed plans to operate special trains from Amritsar, Bathinda, and Chandigarh to Ayodhya. The consecration of Ram Lalla is scheduled to take place on January 22, prompting preparations to accommodate devotees who prefer rail travel. Ambala Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Mandeep Bhatia stated, “Most people prefer to travel by railway, for which the Railways have also made their preparations. Special trains for Ayodhya can run from Amritsar, Bathinda, and Chandigarh, the schedule of which will be released soon. Extra counters can also be set up for tickets.” Regarding ticketing, DRM Bhatia mentioned, “Although 80 per cent of people are inclined towards e-ticketing in which people get the facility sitting at home, extra counters can also be set up if needed.” The consecration ceremony, scheduled to start on January 16 and span seven days, will witness the opening of the Ram Mandir to the public and the consecration of Lord Sri Ram’s idol. Ayodhya is set to be connected to various regions and cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Kolkata, Nagpur, Lucknow, and Jammu, to facilitate travel for devotees. In addition to the railway preparations, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) is gearing up to provide round-the-clock catering services to meet the needs of the large number of pilgrims visiting Ayodhya during this period. For enhanced security during the January 22 event, officials have planned the installation of boom barriers, bollards, and CCTV cameras at all entrances of the Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya. Boom barriers, or tyre killers, are devices designed to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering a property. The security measures aim to ensure a safe and organized environment for the consecration ceremony.",

    "text": "02 ago, 2024 - 09:32 • Lusa A temperatura média na China em julho foi a mais alta registada nesse mês desde 1961, informou o Centro Meteorológico do país asiático. Durante o sétimo mês do ano, a temperatura média no país atingiu 23,2 graus Celsius, 1,1 acima do que a temperatura em anos considerados normais, disse o diretor-adjunto da instituição, Jia Xialong, citado pelo jornal oficial China Daily. \"Em julho, a China enfrentou uma combinação de chuvas extremas e temperaturas extremamente elevadas em todo o país\", afirmou Jia, num evento em Pequim. O sul da China sofreu uma vaga de calor generalizada e prolongada, com várias regiões a registarem temperaturas elevadas contínuas durante mais de 20 dias. Um total de 59 estações meteorológicas nacionais registou temperaturas máximas diárias que bateram ou igualaram os recordes de sempre. No mês passado, foram batidos recordes de calor em todo o mundo, tendo 22 de julho sido o dia mais quente de que há registo na Terra, com uma temperatura média diária global de 17,15°C. O aumento súbito da temperatura média diária entre 21 e 22 de julho deveu-se principalmente a temperaturas significativamente mais elevadas do que o normal no hemisfério norte, particularmente na América do Norte e na Europa, bem como na maior parte da Antártida, explicou o especialista. De acordo com as previsões do Centro, as temperaturas na maior parte da China continuarão a ser mais elevadas do que o habitual em agosto: são esperadas duas ondas de calor significativas na primeira quinzena de agosto, devendo as temperaturas elevadas diminuir no final do mês. Em julho, a forte precipitação causou a morte de mais de 30 pessoas e centenas de milhares de desalojados no centro da China. Nos últimos Verões, os fenómenos meteorológicos extremos causaram estragos no país asiático: os meses de verão de 2023 foram marcados pelas já referidas inundações em Pequim, enquanto em 2022, várias ondas de calor extremas e secas atingiram o centro e o leste da China. Em julho de 2021, o Governo chinês acusou as autoridades locais de \"falta de preparação e de perceção dos riscos\", que causaram a morte de quase 400 pessoas na província central de Henan.",
