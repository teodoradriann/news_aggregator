    "title": "Kim Kardashian Admits She Struggles to Discipline Her Kids – Hollywood Life",
    "text": "Kim Kardashian can’t keep up with her kids sometimes, she admitted in a new episode of The Kardashians. During one scene from the Thursday, June 6, episode, the 43-year-old mom of four vented about how “chaotic” the kiddos — North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm West — are. She shares her children with ex-husband Kanye “Ye” West . “Like, I’ve [run] out of my patience, and that what my like superpower was, calm and patience,” the SKIMS boss said. “They know when to con me and when to throw the little, you know, start with the tears, so I’m like, ‘Stop, stop, sure, take an iPad,’ you know, ‘just stop.'” Kim also admitted that she wished could be more “strict” with her children like her sister Khloé Kardashian , who shares her two kids, True and Tatum, with ex Tristan Thompson. “Sometimes, it gets just like a little intense,” she noted. “I want to be more strict like Khloe, but I don’t know why I have a hard time just saying ‘no is no.’ I think I also just don’t want to deal with the whining and the tears of not getting their way.” The Hulu personality then described the moment she took a Zoom call while “literally hiding in a bathroom” away from her kids. “I had a Zoom at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming, and I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked as I was just like, ‘I can’t believe this,'” Kim said. “I mean I can believe it, but that’s like my biggest nightmare.” As a “a single mom of four,” the Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum noted that life gets “wild” sometimes. However, Kim knows she has to stand her ground when it comes to disciplining her children. She added, “I just have to be like, ‘I don’t care if you’re gonna throw a tantrum in front of everyone right now. The answer is no.'” “I almost feel like my kids have this radar where they know that I’m doing something really important,” she joked. “I thought I was going to end up on an episode of Snapped yesterday.” Although the going gets tough, Kim insisted that she will “always be there for [her] kids, and [she’ll] ride out anything with them.” Nevertheless, “to say that it doesn’t take an emotional toll sometimes, would be lying,” Kim concluded.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nAn international team of scientists has identified a previously unknown compound in the drinking water of approximately one-third of Americans. The compound, named chloronitramide anion, is a byproduct of chloramine, a chemical used by many water treatment plants to make water safe to drink. The study, published in the journal Science, has raised concerns about potential health risks associated with the compound.\nThe researchers, led by Julian Fairey of the University of Arkansas, used advanced techniques to isolate and identify the compound. They found that about 113 million people are exposed to chloronitramide anion through their tap water. However, the toxicity of the compound is currently unknown. The study authors noted that the properties of chloronitramide anion are similar to those of other molecules that are toxic enough for the government to regulate them. According to CNN , the researchers are calling for further research to understand the potential implications of chloronitramide anion in drinking water.\nChloramines have been widely used as an alternative to chlorine for disinfecting drinking water since the 1970s. While they don't seem to have the same potentially dangerous byproducts as chlorine, scientists have noticed that chloramines also create byproducts, one of which remained a mystery until now. Newsweek reports that the discovery of chloronitramide anion could reignite debate over the widespread use of chloramines in water treatment.",

    "text": "Rooftop Sean Wolfe 4.11.2024 Share (Courtesy: Ricardo Gomez Angel/Unsplash) Hawaiian Electric has launched a new framework that streamlines and consolidates choices for customers participating in the company’s rooftop solar energy programs, replacing several existing rooftop solar and energy storage programs. “Smart Renewable Energy,” also known as Smart DER, was developed under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission. It consolidates and replaces all of Hawaiian Electric’s previous rooftop solar programs except for Net Energy Metering (NEM). For solar customers who want to pair their rooftop systems with energy storage, Hawaiian Electric is also offering a new incentive program called “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD), which is replacing Battery Bonus. (On Maui, Battery Bonus will remain open to new applicants until enrolled capacity reaches 15 MW or until June 30, whichever comes first.) Going forward, customers who apply to install a grid-connected solar system must do so through Smart Renewable Energy, which offers an export and a non-export track. Customers enrolled in one of Hawaiian Electric’s rooftop solar or energy storage programs prior to the change have several options to choose from as the company transitions to Smart Renewable Energy and BYOD: NEM and NEM Plus: No changes will be required for customers in these programs. Customer Grid Supply (CGS), CGS Plus, and Smart Export: Customers enrolled in these programs must transition to the Smart DER export track no later than seven years after their initial agreement date, starting Oct. 1, 2024. The transition will be done automatically by Hawaiian Electric. Customer Self Supply or Standard Interconnection Agreement: Customers enrolled in these programs are not required to switch to Smart Renewable Energy, but if they choose to do so they will transition to the program’s non-export track. Customers in any of the above programs have the option of transitioning to Smart Renewable Energy before their agreement end date by filling out a form on Hawaiian Electric’s website. Battery Bonus: Customers are not required to transition to the new BYOD program but have the option to do so prior to their Battery Bonus agreement ending. Join us at GridTECH Connect California, June 24-26, 2024, in Newport Beach, CA! With some of the most ambitious sustainability and clean energy goals in the country, California is at the cutting edge of the energy transition while confronting its most cumbersome roadblocks. From electric vehicles to battery storage, microgrids, community solar, and everything in between, attendees will collaborate to advance interconnection procedures and policies in California. “We are excited to offer our customers Smart Renewable Energy and BYOD, which give them an opportunity to offset their energy bills while helping make the grid more resilient,” said Kaiulani Shinsato, Hawaiian Electric Customer Energy Resources co-director. “Hawaiian Electric is thankful to all the stakeholders who worked so hard to bring this to fruition.” Smart Renewable Energy and BYOD are the culmination of a multi-year regulatory effort that included input from the PUC, Hawaiian Electric, solar industry representatives, and the Consumer Advocate. The Smart Renewable Energy export rates and other information about the new programs are available at hawaiianelectric.com/smartprograms.

    "text": "With their NL East leading 83-56 record, the\n[Philadelphia Phillies](/mlb/philadelphia-phillies) are well on their way to clinching a playoff spot. Before they embark on their postseason run, the Phillies wanted to get a closer look at one of their more intriguing prospects.\nPhiladelphia is\ncalling up right-handed pitcher Seth Johnson to start against the Marlins on Sunday, via Kiley McDaniel of ESPN. Johnson was acquired in the trade that sent Gregory Soto to the Baltimore Orioles.\nJohnson was selected as the 40th overall pick in 2019. However, he played shortstop a year prior. But since making the switch to full-time pitcher, the righty has shown he has true major league potential.\nOver his 67 games at the minor league level, Johnson pitched to a 2.70 ERA and a 269/94 K/BB ratio. During the 2024 campaign – which Johnson has split between the Double and Triple-A levels – he has thrown to a 2.33 ERA and a 83/42 K/BB ratio. In his most recent outing, Johnson pitched six innings of scoreless baseball, allowing one hit and walk while striking out five.\nNow, Johnson will have an opportunity to prove himself at the major league level. He'll be joining one of the best pitching rotations in the league. Led\nby players such as Zach Wheeler, Philadelphia ranks fourth in the league with their 3.70 ERA. They've struck out the eighth-most batters (1,232) while walking the third-fewest (369).\nRanked as the\n15th-best prospect in the Phillies' organization, via MLB Pipeline, Johnson will have an opportunity to prove himself against the Marlins. However, a strong performance could keep Johnson in the rotation on a much more long-term basis.\nPhiladelphia recently\ndemoted Taijuan Walker to the bullpen. His last outing saw him allow four hits two earned runs in three innings. In his two starts previously, Walker allowed 21 hits and 12 earned runs in nine innings. He had a 2/2 K/BB ratio.\nIf Johnson impresses against the Marlins, Walker's demotion could become more permanent. The Phillies are serious in their World Series intentions and want to put their best roster forward. Despite his winding path to the majors, Johnson can prove he should be a part of it on Sunday.",

(Valley News Live) - A Fargo man, James Robert Ludwikowski, is facing 6 charges after a reported terrorizing incident on April 20th. It happened at Rivera Heights Mobile Home Community, which is near the airport. Police responded to a call there just after midnight on 4/21, according to court documents, where a woman told officers she had been locked inside the trailer with a padlock and no way out. She reportedly showed officers a voicemail from Ludwikowski, threatening to kill her if she wasn’t there. Officer state the trailer was covered in dirt and holes. The documents state the victim told police she was only allowed to use the bathroom connected to their room, which did not have a working toilet, so she had to use a cup and box to go to the bathroom. The court documents state James’s son from a previous marriage was in the back room. Officers reportedly found him rolling around in his own feces, playing on tablets covered in feces. The child was taken into protective custody. Ludwikowski was detailed just after 1 AM, reportedly smelling of alcohol and admitting to drinking. According to the court documents, he blamed the state of the house on the victim. Ludwikowski is charged with terrorizing, 2 counts of child neglect, DUI, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He’s pleaded not guilty to the DUI, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia charges. His preliminary heading has been scheduled for June 5th. Copyright 2024 KVLY.

    "text": "After days of summer-like hot and humid conditions, Mumbai residents were in for a delight on Tuesday morning as the city recorded the lowest temperature of the season so far with the Santacruz observatory recording a minimum temperature of 16.2 degrees Celsius. According to scientists and weather experts, the coastal city is experiencing a drop in temperature owing to the northerly winds that arrived on Sunday. The Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba, meanwhile, recorded a minimum temperature of 18.8 degrees Celsius, indicating a sharp drop from Monday when it was 22 degrees Celsius. Before this, the coldest day of the season was January 6 when the temperature dropped to 17.5 degrees Celsius. Following this drop, however, the city started experiencing a sudden temperature rise. Amid the soaring heat, [Mumbai](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/) also recorded the warmest day in January in the past seven years at 35.7 degrees Celsius on January 12. Speaking to [The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com), Sushma Nair, Scientist at IMD Mumbai, said, “Last week, the city was reeling under high temperatures owing to the prominent southeasterly winds, which are moist in nature. However, since Sunday, we have had the northerly wind component, which is dry and cold, which has resulted in a drop in temperature.” The maximum temperature in the city has also dropped from Monday’s nearly 34 degrees Celsius to around 31 degrees in the suburbs as well as in the island city division. The maximum temperature is expected to remain between 30 – 31 degrees Celsius for a day or two, before dropping below 30 degrees, IMD scientists said. Mumbai also breathed easy with the overall AQI touching 69, which is categorised as ‘satisfactory’. Barring two, the city’s 24 stations recorded an AQI in double digits. The best air quality was observed in Vile Parle West (45) and Borivali East (38) where the AQI dropped below 50, which falls in the ‘good’ category. “The change in wind direction is largely responsible for the good AQI,” Nair said.",

    "text": "a week ago\nRadioApp will not load on my Nest Hub Max. Other nest devices in the same household are fine.\nHas been working fine, but stopped within the last week or so. Responds to my voice command \"Play 3AW' but then the loading process freezes. Other radio services seem fine (iHeartradio) works on the Hub max, but RadioApp does not.\nContacted Google support via email ... the suggested the usual reboot and update solutions ... no change. Opened a chat to Google support, nothing additional to help, but they did suggest to open a Feedback on the issue through the Google home app. When enough people report the same issue, it gets the attention of the next level support people, who should be able to resolve the issue.\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nYes ! Display won’t play Global but Nest Mini , Nest Audio & Nest Max all will. Who has the issue , Global or Google ? I have to admit as a loyal Google user for audio it’s lost its edge completely and I am seriously considering converting to the other side\n** Just found a workaround, if you open the radio station on a working speaker you can then add the non working speaker via the Google Home app then deselect the first speaker, hope that makes sense !**\nWednesday\nAlso, instruct google to “ Play via Tunein” Works for me 👍🏻\na week ago\nIt is also doing the same Rayo\na week ago\nYes, same problem here. My best home hub loads global player but it then closes. Briefly worked on my other (non display) speakers.\nseems to be a google wide issue then, as I thought this was just a case of my account unlinking or something.\na week ago\nTry my work around above , this is working consistently with success\nWednesday\nTry playing via Tunein 👍🏻\nThursday\nMy Google nest is doing the same but say what station you want to listen to followed by tune in.\nSo say for instance \"Hey Google Play Heart Dance Via Tune In\" and that'll get around this issue for now.\nThursday\nI have the same problem. Podcasts still working for me, so just a live radio issue I think.\nFriday\nhi yes, this happened to my Nest Hub Max 2 weeks ago, and now, my smaller display 7\" has gone the same way. This morning i hope it is a glitch they can fix and not a license issue with global\nMonday\nIm getting exactly the same issue, also the Rayo app for Hits radio isn't working either. All working fine on my home mini's just not on my nest display 😕\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nAfter France Info two months ago, an issue that has still to be resolved by the way, now the same is happening with BBC World Service, be it on :\nI use the Nest Mini H2C which seems to be more reliable. Whether I ask it in English or in French, it doesn't work. I've tried several French accents and several English accents.\nBBC World Service is still available on TuneIn : https://tunein.com/radio/BBC-World-Service-s322318/\nWhen I get to the BBC World Service website, it says \"We're replacing BBC Sounds outside the UK and bringing you BBC.com, a seamless way to read, watch, and listen - all in one place.\"\nCould that be the source of the problem ?\nI feel like throwing your products out the windows and buying a DAB+ radio.\na week ago\nWe have used out Google Nest Hub to listen to 2GB for a number of years. We live near Port Macquarie and it has always worked perfectly well. A couple of days ago it simply stopped playing 2gb. We can still access other programs like ABC radio however it just will not play 2gb? Please Google can you sort this out?\na week ago\nI've got the same issue in Melbourne, seems 3aw, 2gb, international radio stations have all stopped working. But ABC Radio still works as well as Spotify.\na week ago\nSame issue here. Only one out of the five speakers suddenly stopped playing 3AW. I can get ABC radio on the one that wont play 3AW also. Very strange.\n10 hours ago\nI can't get any radio station to work on mine, have even tried streaming it from my phone it pop's on the display but never plays any audio\n3 hours ago\nTheir saying the bug is fixed maybee April update was cause?\nMonday\nBrisbane is the same\nSaturday\nI am having the same problem, my speaker works fine but both displays are dead only on 3aw and 2gb. Google can you help us please\nyesterday\nInteresting to note, right as we are coming up to an election here the conservative radio stations begin to fail on Google but the Left ABC are fine. It may be suggested that our devices are trying to influence our polling! Fix this Google\nyesterday\nBizarre...I also can stream ABC radio through Radio App but no commercial stations. All sounds a bit Big Brother\n22m ago\nYes I am having the same problem no radio stations will pick up at all . Have emailed 2GB radio station to see if there is another frequency to tune in . Was my favourite station to stream all day . Very disappointing. No one seems to know a fix .\na week ago\nMy ability to play TuneIn radio stations on my Google Nest Hub stopped working on Friday Apr 18th and has not worked since.\nIs there a way to troubleshoot this issue? Currently the only way I have to test is to periodically try again, but there's not output, log files or other troubleshooting methods to determine where the issue is.\nThanks in advance\na week ago\nOk, by the read of it this is broader than just RadioApp which we use in Australia.\nThanks for posting. We are seemingly all in the same boat, now we wait for Google to help out I think.\na week ago\nDoes anyone from Google read these forums? Or is it just customers?\nIt would be great to know how to troubleshoot this issue. I've confirmed the radio station is working fine from the TuneIn website. This is affecting multiple Google Nest Hubs in my house, so it's not just one of them. I've power cycled the Hubs, but no change.\nThanks\na week ago\nI also performed a factory reset on one of my Google Nest Hubs and did not change the situation - TuneIn radio stations still are not playing, it plays the regular ads, then attempts to play the radio station, but just shows the TuneIn radio logo a couple of times in a row, like something is failing. iHeartRadio by comparison, works fine.\na week ago\nand I have the same problem. Streams encoded with the AAC codec don’t work. Only those with MP3\na week ago\nThat's interesting, how did you figure out AAC vs. MP3?\nMy Nest Hub Max will stream Radio, but it first has to be playing on the smaller Nest Hub. I can actually go to the screen on the Max and select the Hub Max to also play the radio. Bit of a work around, and relies on you having both devices.\nThursday\nInteresting angle, one wonders if TuneIn changed their media format on April 18? I would assume not, as that would break lots of things, such as what I'm seeing here, but wouldn't be the first time a \"safe\" change ends up breaking things.\nWould be nice if there was a way to troubleshoot this, to at least get some error messages or something to know where the problem may be. Right now it looks like Google, but it's impossible to tell for sure with what we have available to troubleshoot (ie basically nothing) 😞\na week ago\nA few days ago, both of my Google Home Hubs stopped playing the national ESPN radio station. I was using IHeartRadio (which is my default radio player, I already checked). It says it is connecting, it starts to connect, the IHeartRadio logo pops up and ... nothing! Just the logo on the screen for a minute or so and then it goes back to the clock. I tried unplugging for 30 second, still won't load.\nI just tried to load ESPN Radio using TuneIn. It worked except now I have to listen to TurnIn ads. I'm not spending $99/year for something that was free through IHeart.\nWhat update from Hades did Google upload that broke my ability to listen to sports radio.\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nI'm having the same issue (not able to play anything on iHeart Radio or Audacy). This is with the Google Home Hub. However, both work fine on my Hub Max. Also unable to Chromecast iHeart or Audacy to either of my Home Hubs. Both worked fine previously.\nThursday\nI have the same problem. Have reported to google several times and to RadioApp.. i have heard nothing back. I have also contacted several radio stations for help, but its not them as other friends are still able to use RadioApp on their home googles.. i have also factory reset it .. have deleted an reinstalled the home app also.. nothing has helped.. after 2 years with no problems and now silence, its nice to know i am not the only one\nFriday\nThank God it's not just me. It's been frustrating me for the past fortnight.\nNot very helpful when I use Heart UK to wake me up as part of my morning automation 🤣\nSunday\nYou are lucky you are able to use media alarms - never worked for me - apparently because I use a 'UK English voice'.\nFriday\nMy Nest Hub Max and now my smaller 7\" display have stopped streaming the Global Player and Rayo Radio apps. Are there any clues? Is there a fix forthcoming? Do you know?\nSunday\nSame but my speakers works, seems to be somthing with devices with displays for me\nFriday - last edited Friday\nMine is exactly the same only responds to my command but my radio station doesn’t come on my nest only on the other small devices.\nFriday\nSame for me in the UK.... Global Player and Rayo don't work.\na week ago\nWhy is Google nest hub 2nd gen and Google nest Max not being sold in Australian stores anymore?\na week ago\nYou can select the 'Notify me\" button when stock becomes available, but I don't know when or if stock will ever become available again. They've had no stock for a long time now.\nThey're still selling the Google Pixel Tablet (and charging base) so...🤷\na week ago\nI thought my Nest Hub was faulty and looking to replace it, but now im seeing lots of other customers devices are also not running radio stations anymore, so a new device probably doesnt help.\nI 'think' google are about to drop replacement devices with gemini or something.. which is why they are out of stock, but im not sure if thats months away..",
