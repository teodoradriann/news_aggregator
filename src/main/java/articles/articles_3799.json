    "text": "Boeing Strike Creates Production Challenges for 737 MAX Amid Worker Unrest Over 30,000 Boeing factory workers on the U.S. West Coast began a strike on Friday, impacting the production of the 737 MAX and further complicating the planemaker's supply chain. CFO Brian West discussed the challenges posed by the strike and highlighted ongoing issues within Boeing's defense and space unit. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 23:11 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 23:11 IST Over 30,000 factory workers for Boeing on the U.S. West Coast initiated a strike on Friday, which is expected to hinder the company's ability to meet its 737 MAX production targets and stabilize its supply chain, according to CFO Brian West. The work stoppage follows a rejected contract deal as workers demand higher pay. During the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference, West stated that third-quarter margins for Boeing's defense and space unit are expected to remain negative, mirroring the previous quarter. This strike, the first since 2008, comes at a critical time as Boeing faces scrutiny from both U.S. regulators and customers following a door panel incident on a 737 MAX jet in January. West emphasized that while Boeing had made strides towards their production goals for the 737 MAX, the strike introduces new challenges that could extend the timeline. The disruption has also increased uncertainty for suppliers struggling to align their production with Boeing's fluctuating forecasts. As a result, Boeing plans to halt part intake from suppliers with sufficient inventory for non-strike-affected programs like the 787, produced in South Carolina by a non-unionized workforce.

Sherri Sarouff owns the cafe with her son Stephen, and [SLS Fitness](https://www.slsfitness.com/), a gym down the road. \"I'm really passionate about movement and healthy food and holistic care,\" she said. The Sarouff family is also passionate about supporting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Twenty-five years ago, Sherri started a one-of-a-kind fundraising effort to benefit the hospital. She said the healthy birth of her daughter, Elizabeth, after a difficult pregnancy got her thinking. \"Maybe I could do an event; it would be a fitness event,” she said.” Fun and exciting with a lot of energy, and maybe we'd talk about St. Jude.\" She said she recruited a handful of kids, her children’s friends. She taught them a dance routine, and Fitness for a Cure was born. To date, Sherri said the event has raised more than $8,000,000 for St. Jude. No family is ever billed at St. Jude. Donations fund research and care. Donations are raised by groups like Fitness for a Cure. These days, both Elizabeth and Stephen Sarouff co-chair the annual event. They haven't missed a beat since childhood. More than 100 kids take part in weekly practices and fundraise ahead of the big show. \"It's funny because I don't remember a time without it,” Stephen said. “(It’s) what I did my whole life…the day of the show would come, and it would be my favorite day of the year. (It’s) still is my favorite day of the year.\" \"I wouldn't be the person I am today without growing up with St. Jude,” Elizabeth said. \"You get this deep sense of empathy and perspective that I don't think you would get growing up without some philanthropic work or being involved with a cause like this.\" Fitness for a Cure was recently named St. Jude's Volunteer Group of the Year. The annual show is Saturday, March 16, at Lowell Memorial Auditorium. Find more information [here](https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/find-an-event/dinners-and-galas/fitness-for-a-cure.html).",

Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250710-930-780610/1",

    "text": "La Romagna si sta rivelando un territorio fondamentale nei progetti italiani di diversificazione delle fonti energetiche e nella transizione verso obiettivi di de-carbonizzazione. A sottolinearlo è stato il ministro dell’Ambiente e della Sicurezza energetica, Gilberto Pichetto Fratin , in un messaggio rivolto al presidente di Confindustria Romagna, Roberto Bozzi , in occasione dell’Assemblea generale dell’associazione, tenutasi a San Patrignano, nel Riminese, con il titolo ‘Futuri sostenibili’.\nPichetto Fratin ha ribadito l’importanza strategica della Romagna, evidenziando come “ la Romagna sta contribuendo in modo significativo ai progetti nazionali di diversificazione e approvvigionamento energetico e al contempo al raggiungimento degli obiettivi di de-carbonizzazione “. In questo contesto, ha specificato che “ Ravenna è diventata cruciale con opere come il rigassificatore e l’hub di cattura e stoccaggio della CO₂, un progetto che permetterà di ridurre l’impatto dei settori ‘hard to abate’, assicurando al contempo la competitività delle aziende e scongiurando i rischi di delocalizzazione “.\nIl ministro ha lodato l’impegno dei territori come quello romagnolo, definendoli “ connotati da grande senso di responsabilità nei confronti del Paese “. Ha poi affermato che, grazie a queste realtà locali, “ continueremo a diversificare le nostre fonti energetiche, accelerando l’installazione di rinnovabili e lo sviluppo di nuove tecnologie “. L’obiettivo, ha spiegato Pichetto Fratin , è quello di “ assicurare a famiglie e imprese energia sicura, pulita e a prezzi equi “.\nPichetto Fratin ha infine affrontato il tema della sostenibilità della transizione energetica, osservando che “ l’impegno che il Governo sta portando avanti è quello di fare in modo che i tempi, le modalità e i costi di attuazione delle diverse fasi della transizione energetica siano sostenibili e realisticamente attuabili per tutti i comparti produttivi “. Concludendo il suo messaggio, il ministro ha evidenziato come questo processo debba rappresentare “ un’opportunità di crescita, sviluppo e aumento di competitività per tutto il Paese “.",

    "text": "George Clooney reunited with Brad Pitt on screen in 2008's Burn After Reading but they didn't take time in reigniting their camaraderie while working on their upcoming thriller comedy! George Clooney and Brad Pitt’s bromance started from the get-go in the sets of their upcoming thriller comedy Wolfs. At the film’s TCL Chinese Theatre premiere in Los Angeles on September 18, Clooney, 63, and Pitt, 60, talked about reuniting on screen after a long time and reigniting their camaraderie. \"I'm too old to hit a curve ball, but I think that's an automatic, too. Never going to be a straight answer or straight delivery,\" Clooney says about the Fight Club actor with whom he’s famously collaborated on films like Ocean's trilogy and Burn After Reading. \"No, from the minute we got there, it was just easy to do it again,\" he added. But one thing that the actor and filmmaker loved while working with Pitt was getting to talk on top of each other. “[It] was pretty easy to do because it was fun,\" he said. Helmed by Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts, the story follows two fixers, played by Pitt and Clooney, who are hired for the same job and are forced to work together. \"Over one explosive night, they'll have to set aside their petty grievances — and their egos — to finish the job,\" says the official synopsis. At the carpet, when PEOPLE asked the former Sexiest Man Still Alive title holders about the advice they would give to future candidates, Pitt replied, “This is the Sexiest Man Still Alive,” referring to Clooney. \"Yes, exactly. That's going to be starting now. I know,\" the latter added. In response, the Batman and Robin actor quipped he tried to get the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to start Sexiest Man Alive titles. He later recalled having the t-shirt with the title. “I have the T-shirt, by the way. Somebody else got it. Yeah, all I got was a T-shirt,\" he added. Wolfs will release in theaters on September 20 and stream on Apple TV+ from 27 September onwards.
