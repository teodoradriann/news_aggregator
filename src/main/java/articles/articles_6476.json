    "title": "Hallan cuerpo en avanzado estado de descomposición en San Javier, Medellín",
    "text": "levantamiento de cuerpo CTI Un suceso poco usual ocurrió el miércoles 12 de junio en el barrio San Javier, occidente de Medellín, cuando las autoridades encontraron el cuerpo sin vida de un hombre en estado avanzado de descomposición. Según el reporte oficial, el hombre había estado desaparecido durante varios días antes de que sus compañeros de trabajo, preocupados por su ausencia prolongada, alertaran a su hermano. Al llegar a la residencia, el hermano del fallecido se encontró con un escenario lamentable. Desde el exterior de la casa se percibía un fuerte olor a putrefacción y había una notable presencia de moscas. La madre del hombre fue encontrada en estado de desnutrición, sentada en una silla en la sala. Esta mujer tiene 86 años de edad y compartía la vivienda con su hijo. El cuerpo sin vida del hombre fue hallado en el baño, desatando una investigación para determinar las causas exactas de su muerte.

Este incidente evoca un caso similar ocurrido en abril de este año en El Poblado, comuna 14 de Medellín, donde las autoridades encontraron el cuerpo sin vida de Peter Paul Jaunkus, un ciudadano estadounidense oriundo de Chicago. Jaunkus, quien había llegado a Colombia seis meses antes, había desaparecido durante 17 días antes de que los vecinos alertaran a las autoridades debido al intenso olor proveniente de su apartamento.

It was the first time Hill (five catches, 62 yards) played in Kansas City since being traded away following the 2021 season.\nMahomes completed 23 of 41 passes for Kansas City, which has recorded a playoff victory for the sixth straight season. Rice set a team postseason record with his 130 receiving yards, surpassing Elmo Wright (104 against Miami on December 25, 1971).\nTua Tagovailoa was 20-of-39 passing for 199 yards with one touchdown and one interception for the Dolphins. Miami has lost six straight playoff games since a wild-card victory over the Indianapolis Colts in 2000.\nButker's second field goal of the game, a 26-yarder, gave Kansas City a 13-7 lead with 7:36 left in the first half.\nHe added a 32-yarder with 18 seconds to go in the first half and tacked on a 21-yarder to make it 19-7 with 7:49 remaining in the third quarter.\nPacheco delivered a pivotal blow when he took a direct snap and scored from the 3 to boost the lead to 19 with 11:06 left in the game.\nIn Houston, Stroud completed 16 of 21 passes for 274 yards as the Texans won in the postseason for the first time since January 4, 2020.\nStroud (22 years, 102 days) became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff, surpassing Michael Vick.\n\"To see a young guy go out there, keep his composure, it kind of instills faith in everybody else as well,\" Harris said of Stroud's impact.\nNico Collins had six catches for 96 yards and a touchdown for the Texans (11-7), who rattled off 35 unanswered points after Cleveland's Kareem Hunt caught an 11-yard touchdown pass with 12:18 left in the second quarter.\nNelson and Harris effectively sealed the victory, with Nelson taking his interception 82 yards to the end zone to give Houston a 31-14 cushion with 6:05 remaining in the third quarter.\nThe Browns' attack came back out on the field and ran three plays before Joe Flacco was picked off by Harris, who darted 36 yards to make it a 24-point game.",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "title": "Richard Dawkins' atheism collides with reality - then it crumbles",
    "text": "Do all human hearts have a divine shape hole?\nThe metaphor is the sense of longing that humans feel outside the garden of Eden, where humans lived freely with God, and in contrast to what God created, God alone fills this hole. It claims that it can be done.\nEnter the most well-known atheist Richard Dawkins recently I felt I needed to declare A divine shaped hole that becomes mythical.\nDawkins's claims aren't surprising. After all, he is one of the most prominent figures of the new atheist movement and never hides his disdain for religion. But it's amazing why Dawkins decided to reaffirm his rejection of Christianity and God-shaped holes.\nDawkins's position December, Dawkins Resignation From its blog from the Religious Foundation's Freedom Committee, which protests the decision to remove the FFRF's essay entitled “Biology is Not Prejudice.” In that essay, another member of the new atheistic movement, biologist Jerry Coyne, denounced another blog essay. It promoted and advocated transideology The “woman is the one who says she is her.”\nHis resignation letter, Dawkins defendant FFRF “slops” into the “hysterical cry” on the far left, referring to a backlash from the LGBTQ community.\nIt is not surprising that Dawkins opposes the promotion of transideology. Despite his commitment to atheism, Duckwins confirms the truth about his biological sex.\nThere's a lot of sarcasm Dawkins' resignation from the FFRF triggered a response that underlined the irony of his assumed principled position on trans ideology.\nIrony 1: Debbie Hayton, a biological man who identifies as transgender; I insisted that Dawkins's godless worldview builds a foothold where transideology appears to be plausible.\nHayton observed:\n[M]An important lesson from this unfortunate blunder is that it is not so easy to eliminate the need for religion from humans than atheists would like to think. If we have a divine shape hole, and without an established religion, something else could be replaced.\nIn other words, atheism creates a vacuum for morality, ethics, and all of the biggest questions of life – it is And will Filled by “something else” such as transideology.\nLater Dawkins I responded To Hayton's claim in an essay titled “The Myth of a Hole in the Shape of a God.”\n“Christianity offers reasons to reject transnance. Therefore, Christianity offers only reason to reject transnance. He laughed.\nDawkins “loves it” and calls it “shaming,” implying that “humanity must turn to something equally irrational to ignorance, even if religion is taken away.”\nIrony 2: However, as author Sarah Haider, she herself is an atheist; observation “Except in this case, that could have just happened!”\nHer point? She also rejects divine shaped holes, but religion creates “floors” and generally does not become vulnerable to ideas like transideology and clearly violates common sense. It's clear. Meanwhile, atheism and the “reasons” that it is supposed to be constructed include inherent “vulnerabilities.”\nClearly, one such vulnerability is to provide Petri cuisine for trans ideology to flourish.\nWhat Dawkins misses It is ironic that trans-identifiers and atheists can recognize the pitfalls of Dawkins' worldview, but the real problem is that he appears to misunderstand Christian anthropology.\nChristianity does not simply provide “reasons to reject transnance” based on biological sex. Rather, Christians reject transideology based on human teleology. Transideology not only rejects biological reality, but also rejects it from a Christian perspective. why and For what purpose God created man in the first place.\nThe Bible is clear: God created man and our bodies, For purposes – And that purpose, or telos, is the key to understanding what humans and our bodies are ultimately for.\nThis is where Dawkins's rejection of atheism and Christian purpose is at odds with his crusades against trans ideology.\nEven theologian Carl Truman I believe Dawkins' worldview lives in a world that has made biology a “problem and challenge to overcome,” so he forces a “dramatic reduction in the importance of biology,” and Dawkins, for example, recognizes chromosomes. It does not explain why. If such authority is not given to biological challenges such as cancer or disease, then “decisive authority.”\n“Why shouldn't we treat the differences in biological composition and functional differences between men and women as another set of problems for technology to send to the dustbins of history?” asks Trueman. “Gender theory may seem far apart, but if the body does not give authority solely for efficient causality, evolutionary scientists will inevitably fulfil it. It's difficult to understand why we consider it a problem.”\nThe question is, for Dawkins: What is human? for? What are we the purpose?\nChristianity provides answers. In God's image, God creates humanity as a man and a woman in God's image, and works with him to age and concretely build the creation of the steward. The Bible teaches that humans were created for the relationship between God and one another, and the purpose of humanity in creation is of eternal importance.\nReality is strike Dawkins can laugh at the idea of ​​a divinely shaped hole, but the cracks in his worldview tell the real story.\nIf humans do not have divine terrorism, why should biology (and evolutionary theory built on efficient causality) retain more authority than emotions and, for example, transideology? Dawkins' arguments about transideology, and his general worldview, are built on the sand, making him vulnerable to the shattering waves of the most fashionable philosophy at the moment.\nTransideology flourished as Western culture rejected God's terrorism.\nRather than accepting God-given purposes, our culture believes that authentic purposes are found in self-realization. In this environment, self-identity – your “most authentic self” makes sense why it makes sense to invalidate biology.\nHowever, Christianity offers consistent teleology. Christianity not only teaches us that humans were created with purpose, but we also tell us what their purpose is. Therefore, Christianity denies that humans are merely biological machines. We are not space accidents.\nUltimately, Dawkins's deity hole remains only deeper and empty than he found, but the hole is still filled.",

    "text": "Garrett Garcia went from not finishing a single play as a junior to being Pennsylvania's best Class 2A player as a senior. Garcia returned from a torn ACL that cost him the 2022 season to lead Southern Columbia on offense and defense, and to the program's seventh consecutive state title. On Thursday, he was named the Class 2A State Player of the Year by the Pennsylvania Football Writers. He becomes the seventh consecutive Tiger to be named the state Player of the Year. Julian Fleming and Gaige Garcia split in 2017, Fleming won in 2018 and 2019, Gavin Garcia won in 2020 and 2021 and Braeden Wisloski earned the honor a year ago. Southern Columbia put five players on the 2A team — Garcia, athlete Louden Murphy, offensive lineman Jude Bremigen, defensive lineman Isaac Carter and linebacker Dom Fetterolf. Mount Carmel also had four and Line Mountain two. Eagles' defenders Max Johnson and Chandon Mauer made the team, as did Mount Carmel running back Luke Blessing, tight end Jacob Schultz, offensive lineman Noah Shimko and wide receiver Xavier Diaz. Garcia missed all but one play as a junior and picked up a new position as a senior in fullback. He led the Class 2A champions with 1,762 yards and 28 touchdowns — both team highs. He finished with 128 tackles, including 14 for a loss. He played the final four playoff games with a sprained knee and ankle — his numbers in that stretch: 65 carries for 482 yards, 6 TDs along with 43 tackles. Murphy had one of the best all-around seasons in the area. Murphy ran for 1,570 yards with 25 touchdowns, while also leading the Tigers with seven touchdown catches. He also returned two punts and a kickoff for a score this season. Diaz caught 52 passes for 903 yards and nine touchdowns for the Red Tornadoes. The 903 yards set a school single-season record, breaking a mark set in 1966. Diaz added 592 yards on the ground with 10 TDs. Carter had 71 tackles, 13 sacks, 23 hurries along 18 total tackles for a lass. He also returned an interception for a touchdown in the state championship game. Fetterolf led the Tigers in tackles with 136 and added two sacks. Johnson, a sophomore, had 84 tackles, including 34 for a loss and 13.5 sacks for the Eagles. Maurer was a four-year starter for Line Mountain and led the team with 136 tackles and 11.5 tackles for a loss.
