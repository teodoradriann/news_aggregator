    "text": "A new report debunks baseless theories online that mRNA injections were linked to cardiac arrests in athletes like Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills safety who collapsed during a game in 2023. Since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were authorized in late 2020, anti-vaccination groups in the United States have blamed the shots for deadly heart problems in young athletes. The new report's findings come from an analysis of nearly 1,300 death certificates of Oregon residents ages 16 to 30 who died from a heart condition or unknown reasons between June 1, 2021 and December 31, 2022. Of the 40 deaths that occurred among people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, three occurred in that time period. Two of the deaths were attributed to underlying chronic diseases. The third death was recorded as “undetermined natural cause,” and toxicology tests were negative for alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine or other illicit substances. “When you weigh the risks and benefits, you have to look at that and say, 'You have to go for the vaccine,'” he said.",

    "text": "Zimbabwe Cricket has banned national team players Wessly Madhevere and Brandon Mavuta from cricket for four months for recreational drug use. The two received the sanction after admitting — when they appeared for a disciplinary hearing last Wednesday — to charges of breaching the ZC Employment Code of Conduct that arose when they tested positive for a banned recreational drug during an in-house doping test in December. On top of the ban, Madhevere and Mavuta have been fined 50 percent of their salaries for three months, with effect from January 2024, while they also received final written warnings valid for 12 months. As they undergo rehabilitation overseen by ZC medical personnel, they have also been ordered to train under ZC’s High-Performance program. In a statement, ZC said they have zero tolerance towards drugs and drug taking and, in imposing the sanctions, the Disciplinary Committee considered that drug taking was a serious offence and that the breach by the two players had brought the organisation and the game of cricket into disrepute. In taking the decision, the Committee also considered some mitigating factors, with both players showing remorse and having already started working on withdrawing from the habit and getting their systems clean. Mavuta issued a public statement apologising to cricket stakeholders last week. Meanwhile, ZC has with immediate effect suspended another national team player, Kevin Kasuza, from all cricket activities, pending a hearing, after he tested positive for a banned recreational drug during an in-house doping test last week. He is due to appear for a disciplinary hearing soon. Kasuza is being charged under the ZC Employment Code of Conduct — Sports Reporter/Zimbabwe Cricket.",
