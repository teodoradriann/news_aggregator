    "title": "What are the COVID-19 protocols at the 2024 Paris Olympics?",
    "text": "Five players on Australia's women's water polo team for the Paris Olympics tested positive for COVID-19 this week. Paris is the first Olympics since the Tokyo Summer Games in 2021 and Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 were staged in COVID bubbles with rigorous testing protocols.Video above: A look at what it's like getting around Paris ahead of the 2024 OlympicsSo, what are the protocols for positive tests at the Games this year? A Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN that the protocols recommend mask-wearing for people who test positive.“We regularly remind athletes and all other Games stakeholders of the good practices to adopt should they experience any respiratory symptoms: wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contacts and washing hands regularly with soap and water or using hand sanitiser,” the statement says.“Hand sanitiser stations can be found at all the residential areas and also the restaurant of the Olympic Village,” according to the statement. “We continue to carefully monitor the public health situation in France, in conjunction with the relevant government ministry.”Many of the national teams also may have their own safety protocols to protect their athletes, said Lucia Mullen, an associate scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a member of the World Health Organization’s mass gathering expert group, which regularly works on these issues.“For the COVID-19 cases, as with other respiratory diseases and also other gastrointestinal diseases, they will really promote hand hygiene and other basic hygiene measures – so, keeping distance, reporting to the clinics to get tested if you are feeling unwell and certainly if you’re displaying symptoms,” Mullen said. “Then, of course, isolating if you do test positive.”The Australian water polo team is treating COVID-19 no differently than any other respiratory illness, said Anna Meares, the chef de mission for the Australian Olympic team.“This is a high-performance environment, so we are being diligent,” Meares said at a news conference Tuesday when the team’s first COVID-19 case was announced.“We’re also having the fellow teammates wear masks and just adhere to social distancing measures as well – meeting outside, those sorts of things,” she said.She added that, when respiratory illnesses occur, the person is isolated until their symptoms subside and testing comes back clear.“But I need to emphasize that we are treating COVID no differently to other bugs like the flu. This is not Tokyo,” Meares said, referring to the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, which were delayed by a year due to the pandemic and held without in-person spectators.Although the world is no longer under a public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympic Games come as a wave of COVID-19 infections has hit the United States. Even President Joe Biden recently tested positive for the disease.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that, if you test positive for COVID-19, you stay home until you are fever-free without the help of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours and your symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. It then recommends wearing a mask around other people for the next five days.“We’re in a time period where COVID is still circulating. We are seeing increases of cases again,” Mullen said.“And we’re probably underreporting levels. A lot of countries are reducing their surveillance measures,” she added. “We are expecting that there will be some people traveling to the Games – whether it’s spectators or just to go visit Paris – that may not know they have COVID and be sick, and of course, spread it on to others.”The French capital is expected to welcome about 15 million tourists while it hosts the Olympic Games.Separate public health guidance for travelers attending the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games was released last week by WHO, the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, Santé publique France and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The guidance recommends checking your vaccination status against common infectious diseases including measles, whooping cough, polio and COVID-19.“Cases of measles are on the rise worldwide, including in Europe and in France,” the guidance notes. “Attending a mass gathering event increases your chances of being exposed to respiratory diseases, including whooping cough and COVID-19. If you have symptoms, such as a cough, fever or sore throat, stay at home or in your hotel if possible and consider wearing a mask when you leave your hotel or home.”",

    "title": "California passes first US clothing recycling law: A bold step toward sustainability in fashion",
    "text": "California has taken a groundbreaking step in tackling fashion and textile waste with the passage of SB 707, the Responsible Textile Recovery Act. Signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, this first-of-its-kind legislation in the U.S. mandates that clothing, apparel, and textile producers create a recycling program by 2026. The aim is to combat the growing environmental crisis posed by the fast fashion industry and textile waste, which has increasingly burdened the state’s landfills and ecosystem.\nThe new law, passed with overwhelming support from state legislators, requires producers to be responsible for the collection, repair, reuse, and recycling of textiles statewide. By 2030, convenient drop-off points will be made available to the public, allowing Californians to participate in a more sustainable and circular textile economy. State Senator Josh Newman (D-Fullerton), the bill’s author, emphasized that the legislation is not just about recycling but about changing the way people think about textile waste. “The framework created by SB 707 will create new opportunities for every Californian to participate in a more sustainable future,” Newman stated.\nTextile waste has become a critical environmental issue both in California and worldwide. In the U.S., textile waste has surged nearly tenfold since 1960, reaching over 18.7 million tons in 2018, with an overwhelming 85 percent of it ending up in landfills. Textiles, when left to rot, leach toxic chemicals and dyes into the soil and water, while emitting methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, despite 95% of textiles being recyclable, only 15 percent are reused, highlighting a vast gap between potential and practice.\nThis waste is exacerbated by the fast fashion industry, where consumers buy cheap, disposable clothing intended to last only a few wears before being discarded. These practices not only contribute to environmental degradation but also pose a significant financial burden on taxpayers. In California alone, over 1.2 million tons of textiles were thrown away in 2021, costing more than $70 million to manage the waste.\nWhile initially met with resistance from industry groups, SB 707 has garnered widespread support after significant negotiations. Environmental organizations, municipal waste managers, and retailers such as Ikea and Goodwill have endorsed the bill. Chelsea Murtha, Senior Director of Sustainability at the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), emphasized the importance of collaboration with California’s CalRecycle in the program’s development. “Over the past month, AAFA has intensified conversations with Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs) from other industries, as well as key stakeholders in our industry, to ensure we are in the best possible position to assist with PRO formation,” Murtha said.\nThe creation of a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) is at the heart of the bill’s implementation. Fashion brands, textile manufacturers, and other stakeholders must collaborate to design strategies for effective textile collection, repair, and recycling. By 2026, companies are expected to have nonprofit organizations in place to manage these programs, which will range from mail-return initiatives to thrift store collection sites.\nFor brands like H&M, which have been involved in similar initiatives in Europe, the transition to California’s new system is seen as a step toward sustainability. “As a global fashion retailer, we have an important role to play, and that is why we are transforming our business towards circularity and reducing emissions,” said Randi Marshall, H&M’s regional head of sustainability for the Americas. Similar recycling programs in France and the Netherlands have provided a blueprint for how California can successfully implement its law.\nA significant concern tied to textile waste is its export to poorer countries, a practice known as waste colonialism. When donated or discarded clothing is unsuitable for reuse, it is often shipped to the Global South, where countries like Ghana and Chile become dumping grounds for fast fashion waste. These massive piles of clothing, resembling multicolored dunes in deserts and landfills, illustrate the broader problem of exporting the environmental consequences of over-consumption to vulnerable communities.\nThe Or Foundation, a nonprofit advocating for improved waste management in the fashion industry, has been vocal about the issue. “Waste colonialism is when a group of people uses waste and pollution to dominate another group of people in their homeland,” the foundation noted. The passage of SB 707 is a step toward addressing these global injustices by creating systems that prioritize local recycling and reduce the need to export waste.\nCalifornia’s Responsible Textile Recovery Act sets the stage for a potential national shift in how textile waste is handled. The state’s success could inspire other states to follow suit, pushing for a more unified approach to tackling the fashion industry’s environmental impact. However, Rachel Kibbe, CEO of ACT and Circular Services Group, warned that without federal legislation, a patchwork of state-level laws could create inconsistencies that undermine progress. “A unified federal approach would streamline the system, prevent disjointed efforts, and better enable businesses to comply across state lines,” Kibbe explained.\nDespite the challenges, the passage of SB 707 marks a significant step toward a circular economy in textiles. By encouraging manufacturers to adopt sustainable designs and take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products, California is leading the charge in reducing textile waste and promoting environmental accountability.\nAs Senator Newman noted, “California is again at the forefront of innovation, proving we can lead the way in creating a circular and sustainable textile economy that benefits everyone.” The future of fashion, it seems, is not just in creating new styles but in re-imagining what happens to those garments after they’ve been worn.\n“The industry can no longer rely on voluntary commitments—accountability is now law,” Kibbe said.",

He was awarded the Golden Ball and named to the competition’s Best XI. Carrasquilla then guided Panama over Costa Rica in the 2023/24 Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals to advance to the competition’s final for a second consecutive edition.\nTRANSACTION: Houston Dynamo FC completed the transfer of midfielder Adalberto “Coco” Carrasquilla to Liga MX side Pumas UNAM.",

S'il a fait les beaux jours de Canal+, Pierre Ménèes aime aujourd'hui partager ses analyses sportives, notamment footballistiques, sur les réseaux sociaux. Celui qui a [ été opéré en tout urgence en mai dernier](https://www.melty.fr/people/pierre-menes-opere-en-urgence-dune-eventration-stomacale-la-douleur-est-atroce-2145061.html), n'hésite pas à interpeller Didier Deschamps, à être parfois très dur avec certains joueurs, ou encore à faire des commentaires sur l'actualité liée aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris. Et ce fut le cas le 1er août dernier. En effet, sur X, Pierre Ménès a réagi à la polémique autour de la boxeuse algérienne Imane Khelif, accusée d'être un homme et de combattre dans la catégorie des femmes. Mais voilà qu'un journaliste lyonnais travaillant pour Médave Prod prétend avoir reçu des insultes racistes de la part de Pierre Ménès alors qu’ils étaient en train d'échanger au sujet de la boxeuse. \"L’affaire de la boxe/use/ur algérienne est la première tâche de ces JO. Laissez ça se produire est une faute majeure et une insulte au sport\", a écrit le premier. Ce à quoi, le second a répondu en commentaire : \"Elle a tout a fait le droit d’être présente et le CIO confirme qu’elle respecte les règles. C’est le harcèlement qu’elle subit qui est inacceptable, comme d’ailleurs pour une autre athlète\". Mais voilà que le ton serait monté. Pierre Ménès aurait tenu des propos scandaleux Choqué, le journaliste a alors pris la parole sur son compte X pour dénoncer les propos que lui aurait dits l'ancien consultant de Canal+ : \"Toi aussi tu viens faire l’arabe de service avec ton tweet de merde.

Je n’ai pas compris pourquoi du jour au lendemain il m’a agressé. Mon tweet était simple\", explique le journaliste lyonnais à actu Lyon. Le journaliste souhaite porter plainte contre son confrère Le journaliste indique alors vouloir combattre toutes formes de racisme : \"Mon intention n'est pas de violer la vie privée de quelqu'un mais de défendre ma dignité et mes droits. Mon message est clair : le racisme et les propos haineux ne doivent pas être tolérés, en public et en privé, d'autant plus venant de personnalités publiques\".",

A moção da AIEA, apresentada por Reino Unido, França, Alemanha e Estados Unidos no conselho de administração desta organização das Nações Unidas, teve 19 votos a favor entre os 35 países representados, segundo fontes diplomáticas consultadas pela AFP. China, Rússia e Burkina Faso votaram contra o texto, que também teve 12 abstenções. A Venezuela não pôde participar da votação. Após o voto, o representante do Irã criticou um gesto “politicamente motivado”, em declarações à AFP. “O chefe da Organização de Energia Atômica do Irã emitiu uma ordem para tomar medidas eficazes, incluindo o lançamento de uma série significativa de novas centrífugas avançadas de vários tipos”, de acordo com uma declaração conjunta desta organização e do Ministério das Relações Exteriores iraniano. Centrífugas são máquinas que enriquecem o urânio transformado em gás, girando-o em altíssima velocidade, o que permite aumentar a proporção de matéria isotópica físsil (U-235) para diversos usos. “Paralelamente, a cooperação técnica e de garantia com a AIEA continuará, como no passado”, de acordo com os compromissos assumidos pelo Irã, especificaram as autoridades iranianas. As medidas de represália do Irã “podem ser retiradas” se a AIEA recuar “ou se abrir negociações”, disse à AFP o cientista político Hadi Mohamadi, em Teerã. O texto validado na quinta-feira em Viena, simbólico até o momento, lembra ao Irã as suas “obrigações legais” sob o Tratado de Não Proliferação (TNP), ratificado em 1970. Os países que promovem esta medida denunciam que o Irã acumula quantidades significativas de urânio altamente enriquecido com as quais poderia desenvolver uma arma nuclear. A resolução afirma que “é essencial e urgente” que o Irã forneça “respostas técnicas credíveis” sobre a presença de restos de urânio inexplicáveis em dois locais não declarados, escrevem os autores do texto. Os países ocidentais também exigem “um relatório completo” da AIEA até a primavera de 2025. O Irã defende o direito à energia nuclear para fins civis, mas nega categoricamente que pretenda desenvolver armas atômicas, embora o seu programa nuclear não pare de crescer. O TNP obriga os Estados signatários a declarar e colocar os seus materiais nucleares sob o controle da AIEA. Em 2015, o Irã e as potências mundiais assinaram um acordo que previa o alívio das sanções internacionais contra Teerã em troca de garantias de não desenvolver uma arma nuclear. Os Estados Unidos, porém, retiraram-se unilateralmente do acordo em 2018, sob o presidente Donald Trump, e restabeleceram duras sanções contra Teerã. Em retaliação, o Irã aumentou consideravelmente o seu arsenal de materiais enriquecidos e elevou o limite para 60%, perto dos 90% necessários para fabricar uma arma atômica e longe dos 3,67% estabelecidos pelo acordo. Além disso, desde 2021, Teerã restringiu significativamente a sua cooperação com a AIEA, desligando câmeras de vigilância e retirando a permissão de acesso de inspetores experientes. O presidente iraniano, Masud Pezeshkian, um defensor do diálogo com os países ocidentais, disse querer esclarecer “dúvidas e ambiguidades” sobre o programa nuclear do seu país. O Irã estima ter dado sinais de “boa vontade” ao convidar o chefe da AIEA, Rafael Grossi, para visitar as usinas nucleares de Natanz e Fordo, no centro, na semana passada. pdm/dcp/dhb-bc/es/aa/dd",

    "title": "Atom bomb survivor hopes Japan debut of 'Oppenheimer' will stoke nuclear debate",
    "text": "Teruko Yahata was eight when she saw a blueish-white light envelop the sky over her home city of Hiroshima one summer morning, moments before the first atomic bomb explosion knocked her unconscious and levelled swathes of the Japanese city. Now 86, she is eager to be among the first to see the film \"Oppenheimer\" at its delayed opening in Japan on March 29, hoping the biopic of the scientist who led the development of the bomb will reinvigorate debate over nuclear weapons. \"I don't hold a grudge against Mr Oppenheimer himself or anything like that. It's a much bigger issue,\" said Yahata, who often speaks on behalf of survivors of the nuclear blasts in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two. \"I think it's important for the Oppenheimer film to be screened in Japan, so we can learn from it and not lose that awareness that we need to preserve a future for our loved ones.\" The film about atomic bomb pioneer J. Robert Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is expected to win numerous Oscars at next week's Academy Awards, having already grossed nearly $1 billion since its opening in July 2023. But Japan was initially left out of plans for the worldwide screening. The opening in late summer came just weeks before solemn memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki held annually to mark the bombings that claimed more than 200,000 lives. Some critics said the film glossed over the human cost in Japan. And many Japanese were offended by a grassroots marketing campaign yoking the film to \"Barbie,\" another blockbuster that opened around the same time, with fan-produced pictures of the films' stars alongside images of nuclear blasts. A #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended online in Japan, prompting an apology from \"Barbie\" distributor Warner Bros. Bitters End, a Japanese distributor of independent films, eventually picked up \"Oppenheimer\" and set the opening date of March 29. Neither Bitters End nor global distributor Universal Pictures responded to requests for comment. The only nation to have suffered atomic bombings, Japan has led global efforts to abolish the weapons. The issue took on renewed resonance in 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and nuclear sabre-rattling by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yahata, one of a dwindling number of \"hibakusha\", as survivors of the nuclear explosion are known, waited until late in life to give witness to her experience on the morning of Aug. 6, 1945, and the horrors that followed. She took English lessons to better tell her story to foreign visitors at the bomb museum and monuments in Hiroshima. She recounts glimpsing the blast as she stepped into her family's garden, a moment before its force knocked her back six metres. \"The entire sky flashed and was illuminated in bluish white, as if the heavens had become a huge fluorescent light,\" Yahata has said in her testimony. Thinking about the process of making the bomb and the decision to drop it on her home sends shivers down her spine, Yahata said, but she feels a degree of empathy for Oppenheimer and his team. \"It must have weighed heavily on their consciences,\" she said. \"Oppenheimer probably understood better than anyone what a terrible thing would result from the creation of atomic weapons.\" (Reporting by Tom Bateman in Hiroshima; Writing and additional reporting by Rocky Swift in Tokyo; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",
