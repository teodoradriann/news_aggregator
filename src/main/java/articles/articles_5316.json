    "title": "Argentina Jewish group condemns Milei’s shutting of INADI",
    "text": "Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei , is shuttering the country’s anti-discrimination office, eliciting rare criticism from Jewish leaders who have so far expressed optimism about the right-wing politician’s leadership.\n“ Discrimination in Argentina is a problem suffered by various groups. That is why the DAIA, together with other organizations, promoted the creation of INADI almost three decades ago,” the country’s umbrella Jewish group said in a statement. “The decision to close it violates the protection of the right to equality and peaceful coexistence of our society, which is an example worldwide.” Move is part of Milei's austerity plan\nThe move comes as Milei carries out an austerity plan that he says is essential to putting the country’s economy on the right track. The National Institute Against Discrimination, known by its Spanish acronym INADI, has 400 employees and receives 2,500 complaints a year, according to its most recent report.\n“We will dismantle different institutes which are not useful or are big cashiers for politics or are simply places to generate political militant employment, starting with the definitive closure of the INADI,” Manuel Adorni said during a press conference Thursday at Argentina’s government headquarters, known as the Pink House. Javier Milei at the Western Wall, February 6, 2024 (credit: WESTERN WALL HERITAGE FOUNDATION)\nThe announcement follows Milei’s decision to consolidate 22 government ministries to nine as he warns Argentinians to prepare for difficult economic reforms. It also follows his criticism of INADI as engaging in “ideological persecution,” in keeping with the rejection of diversity initiatives by right-wing politicians in the United States and beyond. Milei is scheduled to speak at a major conservative political convention in Washington, DC, this weekend.\nAnother Jewish organization offered a more optimistic take on the latest announcement. The Simon Wiesenthal Center announced that it agreed with the government assessment that INADI “was not fulfilling the functions for which it was created” but said it believed that battling discrimination would remain a government focus.\nCore functions of the anti-discrimination office, which was created by law in 1995, will be absorbed by the justice department, government officials said later on Thursday. They also said the office had a backlog of 7,500 unresolved complaints.\n“We hope that its closure will be for its effective reformulation,” the Simon Wiesenthal Center said about INADI. “But in no way does Argentina renounce the application of the Anti-Discrimination Law and the other legislation that allows it to be a highly evolved country in that fight, of which we are part.”\nArgentina’s major Jewish groups have expressed only support for Milei since his election in November and inauguration last month. Their opinion has been shaped in part by Milei’s embrace of Judaism and vociferous support for Israel. During his recent emotional trip to Israel, his first abroad since being sworn in, he announced that Argentina will move its embassy to Jerusalem, echoing a move that the United States made during the Trump administration.",

    "text": "Summary\n- Players criticize Infinity Nikki's update for major story changes, bugs, and glitches.\n- Changes include new tutorial, which fans have accused of hurting the storyline.\nInfinity Nikki players are voicing their discontent over recent changes made to the game's opening story. The alterations are part of Infinity Nikki's recent 1.5 update, which fans have heavily criticized.\nThe highly anticipated Infinity Nikki Version 1.5 on April 29 did not go as smoothly as players had hoped. The patch brought some long-requested features like the Dye System and co-op multiplayer. However, the update was struck by multiple bugs, visual glitches, and the inability to log in properly. The number of reports was so large that Infinity Nikki's developers issued an apology and promised to launch over a dozen fixes in the next few days. Now, players are sharing their frustration over some unexpected changes made to Infinity Nikki's story.\nRelated\nInfinity Nikki: How to Unlock All Bubble Season Outfits (Update 1.5)\nThere are plenty of bubbly new looks to collect and show off in Infinity Nikki's Bubble Season, and here's how to unlock them all.\nOn the Infinity Nikki subreddit, players have pointed out that the 1.5 update has greatly altered the game's opening story section. User shirasakirin made a side-by-side comparison of Infinity Nikki's old and new beginnings. The first major change made is that Nikki no longer starts her journey in her mother's attic. Instead, she mysteriously spawns in Infinity Nikki's \"Sea of Stars\" co-op level, changing the lore behind how Nikki arrives at Miraland. Another major change made involves Ena's introduction, who was originally imprisoned before granting Nikki the Heart of Infinity in a powerful cutscene. Now, Ena meets Nikki free of bounds and reveals that Nikki has possessed the Heart of Infinity \"at the dawn of all things.\" The new dialogues also imply that Ena may not return later in the story. \"It's a shame that they removed so many wonderful things from the tutorial,\" added the fan.\nInfinity Nikki Version 1.5 Makes Major Changes to the Game's Story\nAnother user named Infinitype pointed out that the Threads of Reunion outfit, a fan-favorite unreleased 5-star set, is now completely removed from the tutorial chapter. There are also many changes in how Nikki joins the Stylist Guild, meets Dada, and obtains her Pear Pad. \"Honestly, the old tutorial was better; now it feels too disjointed,\" they wrote. User RyanCooper138 wrote a post commenting that the alterations are too drastic, and that the new version leaves too many plot holes. \"This new Sea of Stars sequence with the Seer, while visually breathtaking, has very little substance from the story perspective,\" they argued. Fellow players have echoed their disapproval of the changes made to Infinity Nikki's main story, with some deeming them unnecessary and poorly executed.\nPlayers had high expectations for Version 1.5, as it also marked Infinity Nikki's debut on Steam. Unfortunately, the update's flaws seem to have overshadowed all the features added. It's unclear why the development team decided to change Infinity Nikki's tutorial scenes so much, but perhaps Infold Games will clear players' doubts in the future.\nYour comment has not been saved\nInfinity Nikki\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 80/100 Critics Rec: 88%\n- Released\n- December 5, 2024\n- ESRB\n- T For Teen // Blood, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n- Papergames\n- Publisher(s)\n-\nPapergames,\nInfold Games, Fearless - Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5",
