    "text": "With Season 1 of Marvel Rivals launching today the devs explained that upcoming seasons probably won’t have that much new content.\nWhile the “first” Season of Marvel’s MMO-shooter comes filled with plenty of new content, the devs confirmed that further seasons will not be that packed.\nMarvel Rivals’ launch of Season 1 introduced multiple new characters, maps and much, much more for their hit shooter.\nHowever, NetEase, developer of the game, already explained that upcoming seasons won’t include the same amount of content as Season 1 does.\nIn a new video from January 7, Creative Director Guangguang and Lead Combat Designer Zhiyong not only gave us a more detailed view on what to expect from this new season, but also admitted that this is double the amount of content further seasons will have.\nTelling fans to see Season 1 as a “two-in-one”, Guangguang said:\nDuring our brainstorming sessions, we unanimously agreed that bringing them into Marvel Rivals in one giant-sized season was the way to go.\nWith 5 new heroes, new game modes and more content coming with Season 1 it is more than understandable that upcoming seasons can’t feature this much new content.\nAre you already playing Marvel Rivals Season 1? What are you expecting from upcoming seasons?",

    "text": "A new clinical trial has recently been published in The BMJ, which demonstrates that administering a single, low dose of esketamine immediately after childbirth can significantly reduce major depressive episodes in individuals who experience depressive symptoms during pregnancy.\nThis study, led by Shuo Wang, MD, from the department of anesthesiology at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing, China, specifically focused on women with pre-existing prenatal depression, which is a group at high risk for postnatal depression.\nThe results showed that a single low dose of esketamine injection after childbirth reduced major depressive episodes by about three-quarters, with a longer-lasting effect in mothers with prenatal depression compared to the general population with depression.\nTo explore the impact of esketamine on postpartum depression in mothers with prenatal depression, researchers in China and the U.S. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at five tertiary care hospitals in China from June 19, 2020, to August 3, 2022.",

Steve Kerr slams \"dumbest\" NBA rule that bothers Steph Curry the most Discuss Now Steve Kerr hits out on aggressive closeouts and contact on Steph Curry's shooting hand. -- Photo by GETTY Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr sounded off on the aggressive closeout and contact on Steph Curry's shooting hand that opposing teams seemingly employ. He said that while it is allowed under current rules, it is \"idiotic\" and should be looked at.\nAd He reiterated it following their 131-116 loss to the Houston Rockets in Game 5 of their opening-round NBA playoff series on Wednesday. The four-time champion coach said the tactic used against shooters has become prevalent league-wide and has to be fixed.\nKerr said:\n•\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now \"The rule in the NBA is, once the shot has been released, you're allowed to hit a guy's arm... So, players all over the league are just taking shots at guys' shooting hands. It's the rule. It's idiotic, it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

This is how the league wants it right now. I know we’ve got 30 coaches who all think it’s just idiotic that we allow this. But I'm very confident the league will fix it.\"\nExpand Tweet Ad Steph Curry has been dealing with a right thumb sprain in the ongoing playoffs. In Game 5 against the Rockets, he struggled with his shots, going 4 of 12 from the field and 3 of 9 from deep for 13 points.\nIn the first four games of the series, 'Chef Curry' averaged 26 points on 51.4% shooting and 41% from 3-point territory.\nSteph Curry looking forward to challenge of bouncing back in Game 6 While he expects to be closed out aggressively after shots by the Rockets, Steph Curry said he is focused on getting things done and bouncing back in Game 6.\nAd He talked about the Warriors' resilience in the postgame press conference following their Game 5 loss on Wednesday.\nCurry said :\n\"We talk about our group doing this for the first time together. I love that challenge. We have an opportunity to write our own story, how we bounce back. We have a pretty resilient group in the last two months, and it has to show on Friday.\" Ad Ad In Game 5, the Warriors came out flat and could not recover after Steph Curry was left scoreless in the first 12 minutes and saw his team trail the Rockets, 40-24.\nThe team tried its best to make up for lost ground in the succeeding quarters but just could not find the headway it was looking for.\nDespite the loss, the seventh-seed Warriors lead the series against the No. 2 Rockets, 3-2. They have the opportunity to close out the series on Friday at the Chase Center in San Francisco.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Así lo explicó ayer la portavoz socialista, Catalina Cladera, proponiendo tres grandes acuerdos en materia de medioambiente, turismo y movilidad. «Galmés, sea valiente, haga al menos un gesto que le dignifique como presidente. No deje que la ultraderecha gobierne Mallorca, rompa con el fascismo y seguirá gobernando», expresó Cladera durante el Debate de Política General del consell celebrado este jueves. Así, la socialistas «extiende la mano» a Galmés para que dé un primer paso y destituya a los consellers insulares de los ultraderechistas. «Vox no ha venido a gestionar, viene a reventar las instituciones», denunció la portavoz. A cambio de este gesto, ofrece pactar la protección del territorio al limitar los usos residenciales y turísticos en los inmuebles situados en suelo rústico. Sobre turismo, le plantea que Mallorca no crezca en plazas turísticas, que no se pueda comercializar ninguna nueva y «apostar por el decrecimiento». En cuanto a la movilidad, le pide avanzar en la sostenibilidad con una reducción del número vehículos, apostar por el transporte público y firmar un nuevo convenio ferroviario. En su discurso, Cladera también recordó que el pacto de gobierno en el Consell de Mallorca fue una «imposición» de la presidenta del Govern, Marga Prohens, como «moneda de cambio» para no tener que incluir a Vox en el Consell y acusó a Galmés de «agachar la cabeza» al «posicionarse con el fascismo en contra de la democracia». «Dos partidos distintos» Por su parte, en su turno de réplica, Galmés no respondió de manera directa a la oferta de Cladera aunque sí reivindicó su acción de gobierno y su pacto con Vox, resaltando que son dos partidos distintos que se presentaron a los comicios en listas separadas. También resaltó que el PSOE «castigó» a Cladera al mantenerla como portavoz del PSIB en el Consell y no ofrecerle un puesto de senadora o delegada del Gobierno. Por otro lado, Més per Mallorca reprochó a Galmés que el Consell no condenara hasta el día de ayer el «ultraje» que sufrió una Hija Predilecta de Mallorca, como Aurora Picornell. Asimismo, el portavoz de los ecosoberanistas en el Consell, Jaume Alzamora, reprochó que la institución insular no haya hecho todavía un acto en defensa del colectivo LGTBI por el Día del Orgullo. Alzamora censuró que lidere Galmés el «gobierno de las tijeras» por sus «recortes» en políticas sociales, medioambientales, lingüísticas o de juventud. En el caso de El Pi, el portavoz en la institución insular, Antoni Salas, también se mostró muy crítico con el acuerdo de Galmés con Vox. «Usted es presidente gracias a la ultraderecha, ustedes dicen que son el centro, pero no es así, son la derecha que con tal de gobernar consiente a la ultraderecha. Le haré una oferta Galmés, abandone el pacto con Vox, saque fuera los extremismos y pacte con El Pi», detalló Salas. n [RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20PSOE%20pide%20a%20Galm%C3%A9s%20que%20rompa%20con%20Vox%20en%20el%20Consell%20https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/28/psoe-pide-galmes-rompa-vox-104412716.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/28/psoe-pide-galmes-rompa-vox-104412716.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/28/psoe-pide-galmes-rompa-vox-104412716.html&text=El%20PSOE%20pide%20a%20Galm%C3%A9s%20que%20rompa%20con%20Vox%20en%20el%20Consell%20%20https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/28/psoe-pide-galmes-rompa-vox-104412716.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40diariomallorca) [RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20PSOE%20pide%20a%20Galm%C3%A9s%20que%20rompa%20con%20Vox%20en%20el%20Consell%20&body=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/28/psoe-pide-galmes-rompa-vox-104412716.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [Copiar URL](javascript: void(0)) [Los hoteleros piden a los residentes 'un cambio de chip' sobre el uso del vehículo privado](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/26/hoteleros-piden-residentes-reduzcan-viajes-104308337.html) [Ciutadella prende la mecha de otro Sant Joan masivo con un mensaje: 'Mallorquines Go Home](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/23/ciutadella-prende-mecha-sant-joan-masivo-con-mensaje-mallorquines-go-home-104186849.html) [Proponen que solo se permita un alquiler turístico por persona, pagar por ir a la Serra de Tramuntana o limitar las hamacas en las playas](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/26/proponen-cobrar-euro-acceder-serra-tramuntana-permitir-alquiler-turistico-persona-reducir-hamacas-playas-104328202.html) [El juez deja en libertad al dueño del Medusa Beach, detenido por el derrumbe mortal](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/26/detenido-medusa-beach-derrumbe-dueno-104318258.html) [El Consell de Cladera disparó el gasto en consumo de cruasanes](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/24/consell-cladera-disparo-gasto-consumo-104192262.html) [La masificación difusa y silenciosa de Mallorca: Un chalé nuevo en suelo rústico cada 26 horas en los ocho años del Pacto de izquierdas](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/26/masificacion-difusa-silenciosa-mallorca-chale-104270086.html) [El investigador del CSIC, Fernando Valladares: «La auténtica prosperidad solo es posible con el decrecimiento»](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/27/investigador-csic-fernando-valladares-autentica-104355313.html) [Pollença, Alcúdia y Santanyí, los tres municipios líderes en alquiler turístico en Mallorca](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2024/06/24/pollenca-alcudia-santanyi-tres-municipios-104163038.html)",
