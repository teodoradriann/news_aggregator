    "text": "SOUTH BOSTON — Because of weather forecasts calling for persistent rain in the region Saturday, South Boston Speedway officials have postponed Saturday afternoon’s URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event featuring the SMART Modified Tour’s Pace-O-Matic King of the Modifieds race and have rescheduled the event for Sunday with a 3 p.m. start time. “We made this decision early in an effort give both the competitors and our loyal fans ample time to alter their plans and save them the effort and expense of coming to the track on Saturday and likely not being able to see the event,” South Boston Speedway General Manager Brandon Brown said. “Nobody likes to postpone an event early but making this decision early was done in everyone’s best interests.\" The Sunday event schedule has registration and pit gates opening at 10 a.m., practice running from noon to 1:40 p.m., gates opening and qualifying starting at 2 p.m. and the first race of the afternoon starting at 3 p.m. People are also reading… The 125-lap Pace-O-Matic King of the Modifieds race, which will pay $20,000 to win, is a new crown jewel event and will be one of the country’s biggest and richest asphalt Modified races of the season. The entry list for the race includes the stars of the SMART Modified Tour powered by Pace-O-Matic, including former NASCAR Cup Series star Ryan Newman, 2023 SMART Modified Tour Champion Burt Myers, teenager Carson Loftin who has won the first two SMART Modified Tour events of the season, and 2023 Bowman Gray Stadium NASCAR Modified Division Champion Brandon Ward. They will be joined by some of the top Modified drivers from the North including Matt Hirschman, Doug Coby, Woody Pitkat and Jimmy Blewett. A 100-lap race for South Boston Speedway’s Sentara Health Late Model Stock Car Division will co-headline Sunday afternoon’s racing action. That race will kick off the chase for the 2024 division championship. Two-time NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series national champion Peyton Sellers, of Danville, will start his quest for a record-tying seventh South Boston Speedway NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Division championship in the race. He is expected to be joined by a number of competitors including 2023 Motor Mile Speedway champion Mike Looney, of Catawba; 2023 Martinsville Speedway winner Trevor Ward, Jacob Borst of Elon, North Carolina, and Blake Stallings of Danville. Also on Sunday, the Virginia State Police HEAT Hornets Division competitors will launch their 2024 championship chase in the 20-lap race that will round out the slate of races for the URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event. Advance tickets for the URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event are priced at $17 each.

    "text": "Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche faced significant market pressure following disappointing results from its Phase IIb \"Padova\" study of the Parkinson's disease drug Prasinezumab. The clinical trial, which involved 586 early-stage Parkinson's patients over a 76-week period, failed to achieve its primary objective of significantly delaying disease progression symptoms. Despite showing potential clinical efficacy, the statistical significance threshold remained unmet, leading to immediate repercussions in market trading. The news triggered a notable decline in Roche's share price on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SIX), with shares dropping as much as 2.9% to reach a daily low of 247.30 CHF.\nMarket Outlook\nDespite the current setback, analysts maintain an optimistic long-term perspective on Roche's market position. The stock, while currently trading 15.51% below its 52-week high of 288.20 CHF from early September, remains well above its May low of 212.90 CHF. Analysts project an average price target of 274.29 CHF, and shareholders can anticipate an increased dividend of 9.81 CHF for the current fiscal year, up from the previous year's 9.60 CHF.\nAd\nRoche Stock: New Analysis - 20 December\nFresh Roche information released.

    "text": "3rd most capped player in OM history and captain of the Minots, François Bracci has died\nIt is a monument to the Olympique de Marseille which has bowed out: François Bracchi has experienced everything in the blue and white jersey, from the title of champion of\nFrance in 1972 to the Minots epic in the mid-1980s. left side died at the age of 72.\n342 matches played in the OM jersey: only Roger Scotti (452) and Steve Mandanda (613) have managed to do better than François Bracci and it is not an empty word to write that it is an authentic legend of the Marseille club who disappears following a long illness.\nThe left back born in Alsace was passionate about OM and he made his dream come true by wearing the blue and white jersey. Although he also played in Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Rouen and Béziers, it was with “his” club (1971-1979 then 1983-1985) that he marked his era. An\ninternational (18 caps), he played in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the crowning achievement of a career where he experienced everything with OM.\nChampion of\nFrance in 1972, winner of the Coupe de France in 1976, he experienced the club’s last successes before a decade-long eclipse, but if one day Bernard Tapie set his sights on OM, it was also because that Bracci was the captain of the Minots team that brought the club back to Division 1 in 1984.\nHaving become a coach, he has competed in the Algerian and Moroccan championships over the last two decades. It was with Mouloudia Algiers that he won the Cup and the Super Cup in 2006 then the champion title in 2010.\n2023-12-28 21:09:30\n#3rd #capped #player #history #captain #Minots #François #Bracci #died #Flashscore.fr",

    "text": "New Delhi, July 5 : The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy on Friday announced that the capacity of Tranche-II under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme will be 450,000 TPA (tonnes per annum) of Green Hydrogen, with 40,000 TPA capacity reserved for biomass-based pathways (bucket-II) and the rest for technology agnostic pathways (bucket-I). Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) is the implementing agency for this tranche as well. The Request for Selection (RfS) will be issued by SECI shortly. The bidding will be based on the least average incentive quoted by the bidder. The minimum bid under bucket-I is 10,000 TPA while the maximum bid is 90,000 TPA. The minimum bid capacity in bucket-II is 500 TPA and the maximum capacity is 4000 TPA. A bidder can bid in any or both buckets. The maximum capacity which a single bidder can be allotted in this tranche is 90,000 TPA, the Ministry said. The National Green Hydrogen Mission was launched on 4th January 2023, with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crores up to FY 2029-30. It will contribute to Indiaâ€™s goal to become Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) through clean energy and serve as an inspiration for the global clean energy transition. The mission will lead to significant decarbonisation of the economy, reduced dependence on fossil fuel imports, and enable India to assume technology and market leadership in Green Hydrogen.",

(KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.
