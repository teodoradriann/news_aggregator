    "title": "'Living through hell': Biden mourns with family of US hostage killed by Hamas. Live updates",
    "text": "President Joe Biden said he and the first lady were “devastated” to learn an American citizen believed to be a hostage in Gaza had actually died in the Oct. 7 attacks by militants.\nThe death of Judith Weinstein, a 70-year-old citizen of the U.S., Israel and Canada, was announced Thursday by Kibbutz Nir Oz. Less than a week before, the kibbutz had said her husband, Gad Haggai, 73, was also killed in the Hamas rampage that started the war. Their bodies have not been returned.\n“I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me,” Biden said in a statement. “They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal.”\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nWeinstein was the mother of four and grandmother of seven. She and her husband were shot while out on a morning walk Oct. 7, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. “She will be remembered for her compassion, her peaceful nature and the creative life she built with her husband.”\nPalestinians inspect the rubble of a building destroyed in an Israeli strike in Maghazi refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, on Dec. 25, 2023.\nDevelopments:\n∎ Troops operating in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza located several tunnel entrances, including one in a mosque, the Israeli military says. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using mosques and public buildings for military quarters and as hiding places.\n∎ Thousands of Israeli teens chanted “Everyone, now” as they marched near the Knesset in Jerusalem calling for the return of the hostages from Gaza.\nAirport protests over Gaza in NYC, LA: Some travelers forced to walk to terminals\nIsrael: Troops not justified in shooting 3 hostages Israeli troops who accidentally shot three militant-held hostages should not have opened fire because the shooting “did not match the risk” they faced as a firefight unfolded, according to a conclusion issued Thursday by the Israeli military.\nThe shooting took place in Gaza less than two weeks ago, shocking Israel and fueling protests aimed at pressuring the government to make a deal with Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages.\n“The shooting of the hostages should not have been carried out, this shooting did not match the risk and the situation,” Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi wrote. “However, it was carried out under complex circumstances, and under intense combat conditions under prolonged threat.”\nThe three men were shirtless and had emerged from a building with a white flag when Israeli troops encountered them in Shejaiya, an area of north Gaza where clashes between the military and militants had taken place for several days. Two of the hostages were shot and killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew.\nA commander ordered troops to cease fire, but two soldiers who did not hear the order because of noise from a nearby tank shot the third person, Halevi wrote. Only later were the bodies confirmed to be those of three Israelis, Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz.\nHalevi said commanders must make sure operational instructions are clear “so that we don’t kill ourselves.”\n“The (military) failed in the mission of rescuing the abductees in this incident,” Halevi concluded. “The entire chain of command feels responsible for the difficult event, grieves over this outcome and shares in the grief of the three families of the abductees.”\nNo more hostage releases unless war ends, Hamas official says Any further release of the hostages held in Gaza will require an end to the war, not merely a temporary cease-fire, a Hamas official said Thursday.\nOsama Hamdan said at a news conference that the Palestinian militant group would consider “any ideas or proposals for a complete and final cessation of aggression against our people in the Gaza Strip” but not a partial truce.\nHamas released more than 100 hostages, almost all women and children, as part of a weeklong truce in late November, in exchange for Israel freeing 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel believes approximately 100 hostages remain in Gaza.\nHamdan also said it would be strictly up to Palestinians to decide who rules Gaza after the war, and that they would “not accept a leadership that comes on the back of a Zionist or American tank or under the protection of this tank.”\nIsrael ‘regrets harm to civilians’ in refugee camp assault The Israeli military apologized Thursday for a strike that killed dozens of people in the Maghazi refugee camp in the center of Gaza this week, admitting the assault likely caused “unintended harm” to civilians. The military issued a statement to USA TODAY saying Israeli fighter jets struck two targets near where Hamas militants were found.\nThe strike late Sunday destroyed several houses in the camp that were packed with refugees who had fled northern Gaza under Israeli evacuation orders. At least 70 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel says it orders evacuations ahead of such strikes, but local residents told Al Jazeera there was no warning before the bombs slammed into the camp.\nSteps had been taken to “mitigate harm to uninvolved civilians” in the area, the military said. A preliminary investigation revealed that additional buildings near the target were hit and “likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians.”\nThe military said the General Staff’s Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, responsible for investigating exceptional events that occur during combat, was reviewing the attack.\n“The IDF regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians and is acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event,” the statement said.\nIsraeli singer poised for big break killed in Gaza An Israeli military reservist killed in Gaza this week had successfully auditioned for a TV show that picks Israel’s submission to the wildly popular Eurovision Song Contest. Shaul Greenglick, 26, performed in Israeli army fatigues on “Israel’s Rising Star” on Dec. 3 while on furlough from the war. He sang a popular ballad and was moved through to the next round in the process, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n“It’s reassuring that someone like you is in uniform,” singer and competition judge Keren Peles told Greenglick. “I would be happy to see you representing Israel at Eurovision.” Peles later said Greenglick had been forced to drop out of the contest because of his military duties.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: ‘Living through hell’: Biden mourns with family of US hostage killed by Hamas.

    "title": "CHICKEN RICE STALL @ PASIR RIS PAYING $16,000 FOR RENT AND DISHWASHER | Nestia",
    "text": "The chicken rice stall was grappling with an exorbitant rental cost, a burdensome additional expense of $2,000 for a dishwasher, and a substantial 20% profit reduction on each item sold. These financial strains seemed incredibly unjust and unsustainable, akin to daylight robbery for a small business owner striving to make both ends meet.I recently spoke to the shop staff at the chicken rice stall in Pasir Ris Drive 6, and it’s disheartening to hear about the challenges they’re facing. The cost of living in our area has skyrocketed, forcing the chicken rice stall owner to make the difficult decision to close down the business. It’s a testament to the tough times many small businesses are enduring.The shop was dealing with a rental cost of a staggering 14K, an additional 2K for a dishwasher, and a 20% profit cut for each item sold at the stall. This seemed incredibly unfair and unsustainable, almost like daylight robbery for a small business owner trying to make ends meet.On top of these challenges, when the coffee shop decided to renovate, the stall owner had to shoulder a certain percentage of the renovation costs, adding further strain.In the midst of this adversity, Coffee shop has stepped up to continue the business. They’ve made adjustments by retaining the staff and shortening business hours, displaying resilience and adaptability in a tough market.One of the most pressing issues faced by the chicken rice stall was the exorbitant rental cost. At a staggering $14,000 per month, this figure was nothing short of astronomical for a small business. It created a constant cloud of financial anxiety that loomed over the stall owner’s head, making it increasingly difficult to maintain profitability.Adding to the financial woes was an unexpected $2,000 expense for a dishwasher. While maintaining hygiene standards is crucial for any food establishment, the sudden need for this equipment further exacerbated the already precarious financial situation.In an industry where margins can be tight, a 20% profit reduction on each item sold was a heavy blow. This reduction was not only affecting the business’s bottom line but also putting pressure on prices, potentially driving away loyal customers.",

    "title": "Ram Temple Consecration Event: IUML accuses BJP of using Ram Temple consecration event for political purposes | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "MALAPPURAM: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, accused the BJP on Friday of exploiting the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for political purposes. The IUML expressed hope that secular forces would recognise this political manoeuvre of the BJP. Amid increasing uncertainty in the Congress's Kerala state unit on the political stance the party should take regarding the invitation to its national leadership for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the IUML urged the Congress to take an independent decision. \\\"The BJP is treating it as a political inauguration for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The prime minister and others have launched a political propaganda aimed at the next parliamentary election,\\\" IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty told reporters after the party's political affairs committee meeting. Alleging that the saffron party is politicising the event by differentiating between those who participate in it and those who don't, Kunhalikutty said, \\\"The BJP government's target is the next parliamentary elections. The League highly respects the faith and freedom of worship of the Hindu community. No comment on that. But the opening of the Ram temple is being used politically.\\\" He said the issue is political, not religious, and called on every political party, especially those with secular views, to realise this and take independent decisions. On the Congress's stand, Kunhalikutty said, \\\"Congress has its own set up, leadership. They are facing a lot of problems. Let them take an independent decision.\\\" IUML supremo Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal added that the IUML supports the faithful on the issue but cannot accept the attempt to turn it into a political agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The IUML's statement is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the Congress's state unit, which is in a difficult position regarding the invitation extended to its national leaders for the consecration ceremony next month. The ruling CPI(M) in the state has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, considering it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months.",

    "text": "中國官媒近日連續發文質疑輝達(NVIDIA)的H20晶片有安全漏洞，甚至還陸續發出通知，要求企業避免使用H20晶片，儘量採用國產晶片，引發外界關注。專家分析，質疑H20晶片有國安疑慮完全只是藉口，這是中國有意為輝達的對手─華為製造一個喘息的空間，原因是目前能和H20抗衡的華為昇騰910C晶片出現設計瑕疵，華為至少須要1年的時間進行升級，而這除了顯示中國鐵了心要走「自主科技研發」這條路外，未來這一年，中國晶片市場也將成為輝達和華為的角力戰場。\n輝達H20遭中國官媒質疑有國安問題\n就在輝達執行長黃仁勳好不容易說服美國總統川普放行降規的H20晶片進口中國之際，中國官媒近日卻連續發文質疑H20晶片存在「後門」風險，並稱其不先進、不環保，呼籲企業「不買」，尤其反對國有企業或民間企業在涉及政府或國家安全相關業務時使用H20晶片。\n中國圍剿H20 美中科技戰一環\n中國網信辦甚至還約談輝達，要求提交安全證明，突顯了質疑背後的地緣政治動機。但輝達除了否認後門指控外，更強調產品的安全性。這種種的動作，看在學者專家的眼中，完全是美中科技戰的一環。\n從禁售H20到開放 川普為何回心轉意？\n資策會前研究總監陳子昂就分析，川普之所以回心轉意，從嚴禁H20晶片進入中國到願意放行，不只是因為輝達承諾將H20輸入中國營收的15%上繳美國政府，更重要的是他相信黃仁勳和負責白宮AI事務主管薩克斯(David Saks)的意見，絕不能把中國晶片市場拱手讓給華為，這反而將會助長中國的科技發展。\n他說：『David Saks說，我們一定要讓美國的AI晶片搶佔中國市場，不要把中國市場拱手讓給華為。為什麼他們都會同時講這句話？最主要是華為昇騰910C，經過國外的專家的測試，它的performance 是比現在的H20要來得好，當然它有兩個特色，第一，performance比現在的H20要來得好，\n拋H20涉國安只是藉口 只為華為爭取喘息空間\n而對於美方的意圖，中國自然也看在眼裡，只是在這關鍵時刻，華為昇騰910C晶片被發現有設計瑕疵，會過熱造成當機的問題，這至少須要1年的時間進行升級，因此中國才拋出了H20涉及國安爭議的說法，把它當成藉口，用意就是要為華為爭取喘息修正的空間。\n陳子昂說：『他(中國)會不斷的、不斷的用這個，那個來延緩輝達跟AMD(超微)迅速搶佔中國，他當然目的就是要讓華為有一個喘息的空間，趕快把這個有bug的那個昇騰910C給那個upgrade(升級)上來，當然我認為，輝達不會笨到去搞一個後門，然後重蹈華為在西方市場的情形，所以我認為，輝達可能真的沒有後門，但網信辦跟官方的媒體，還是會不斷的放出這樣的訊息。』\n厭倦遭美科技圍堵 中國鐵了心要走自主科技研發\n對於中國的這番操作，中華經濟研究院第一研究所助研究員王國臣則認為，這完全顯示中國面對美國在科技上不斷圍堵和卡脖子已經失去耐心，現在就是鐵了心要走自主科技研發的這一條路。\n王國臣說：『我覺得現在的美中的產業鏈，從稀土戰開打之後，事實上就是一個明顯的轉捩點，那在這個轉捩點之後到現在就是中國是鐵了心要自主科技研發，\n至於外界估算即使輝達靠著H20重新回到中國，但市場地位已不如以往。根據投資機構伯恩斯坦(Bernstein)分析，儘管輝達積極搶救中國版圖，2025年在大陸AI晶片市場的市占率仍預估將從2024年的66%，跌至54%，難以回到過往獨霸局面。但陳子昂卻持不同意見。\n他說：『目前它的佔有率並沒有往下掉，他的佔有率舊的資料是因為有華為的昇騰910C，那個侵蝕了輝達的H20的市佔率，但是現在華為這顆晶片有bug，所以在未來這段時間，輝達的H20應該暫時是沒有競爭對手。』\n中國晶片市場 將成華為和輝達角力戰場",

Seja por desafio à doutrina da Igreja, ambições políticas ou controvérsias pessoais, essas figuras públicas não enfrentaram apenas críticas — elas foram excomungadas. De reis e revolucionários a ícones da cultura pop, o clero lhes deu a punição máxima (pelo menos na Terra, se deixarmos o depois da morte de fora), com consequências pessoais e públicas duradouras.\nMas o poder da Igreja Católica de excluir não é apenas uma coisa do passado. Mesmo hoje, a Igreja ocasionalmente emite essas proclamações dramáticas. Curioso sobre quem foi pego nisso? Clique para descobrir.",

You can check out at any time. More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Leeds United went to the top of the Championship with a 2-0 win over Stoke City thanks to a brace from Joel Piroe on Boxing Day.\nThe visitors were comfortably the better side and took control after the opening knockings. Jayden Bogle had a terrific game and linked up well with Daniel James on the right. The winger, a live wire all match, eventually got his assist in the second half.\nPiroe had not scored in five matches prior the trip to Staffordshire but will travel back to Yorkshire with a confidence boost after two well-taken goals. He now has nine for the season. A number of other players can hold their heads high after showing that they can do it on a cold, misty night at Stoke.\n1 - Illan MESLIER\nMade a good stop inside the first two minutes from Lewis Koumas. Didn&apos;t have much to do otherwise but that save at 0-0 alone was important given Leeds&apos; frustration away from home before this game. 7\n2 - Jayden BOGLE\nPlayed several balls through to the onrushing Daniel James. Lovely nutmeg on Lynden Gooch in the first half and was really productive throughout the first half. Never looked quite at the same pace after his knock shortly after half-time but still worked the touchline. 8\n6 - Joe RODON\nCommunicated with Bogle well throughout the match to put out fires. An assured presence and kept Stoke striker Tom Cannon quiet for the entirety. 8\n5 - Pascal STRUIJK\nA calm and assured presence throughout. Barely troubled and always chose the right option, whether it be a pass or a clearance. 8\n25 - Sam BYRAM\nPlayed the sensible ball while trying to be proactive and positive. Did the basics well and kept Stoke&apos;s attackers out of the box. A professional display. 7\n4 - Ethan AMPADU\nDictated play from the quarter-back role and initially dipped back to help the defence when needed. This got less and less as Leeds took control and he became the engine for most attacks. A sturdy display. 7\n8 - Joe ROTHWELL\nDid the hard graft to allow Ampadu and those around him the space to drive forward. Not the most notable performance but still an impactful one, make no mistake. 7\n7 - Daniel JAMES\nLinked up with the ever-working Bogle very well and provided a number of brilliant balls. Had Gooch on toast a number of times and was always a threat. Got his well-deserved assist for Piroe&apos;s second and was given a big round of applause from the away corner as he was taken off. 9\n11 - Brenden AARONSON\nProved to be a headache for the hosts and provided the through-ball for the goal. A good display yet quiet for large patches and a sense of that he had another gear that wasn&apos;t unlocked. 7\n14 - Manor SOLOMON\nShould have scored in the first half from James&apos; cross midway through the first half. Was much better on the second half and went close a few times. Did better when told to go direct. 7\n10 - Joel PIROE\nTook his first goal from the angle really well having not managed to do much with the half-chances he had before. Couldn&apos;t miss his second one from just three yards out. A real confidence-booster. 8\nSUBS 17 - Largie RAMAZANI (on 76 mins)\nHad a good run down the left shortly after coming on and produced a teasing cross with nobody there. Was the brightest of the substitutes, always looking to get in behind. 6\n19 - Mateo JOSEPH (on 79 mins)\nFlashed an effort wide a few minutes into his appearance before being unable to steer home under pressure from a corner. 6\n22 - Ao TANAKA (on 79 mins)\nCarried on where Rothwell left off. Did his job fine albeit managed only a few touches. 5\n29 - Wilfried GNONTO (on 76 mins)\nMade a nice curved run to invite a defence-splitting ball. Kept running. 6\n33 - Isaac SCHMIDT (on 90 mins)\nToo late for a rating. N/A\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "title": "Reporter goes viral for attacking Christians who believe rights come from God — and the responses are glorious",
    "text": "Politico reporter Heidi Przybyla claimed on Thursday that Christians who believe rights are derived from God are \"Christian nationalists.\" Speaking on MSNBC, Przybyla claimed that former President Donald Trump is surrounding himself with an \"extremist element\" of Christians, whom she identified as \"Christian nationalists.\" That's when things got weird. According to Przybyla, there is one belief that all so-called Christian nationalists share. \"[T]he thing that unites them as Christian nationalists — not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different — is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don't come from any earthly authority. They don't come from Congress. They don't come to the Supreme Court. They come from God.\" The \"problem\" with believing that rights come from God, Przybyla claimed , is that \"men\" misapply \"so-called natural law\" to oppose progressive issues, like abortion, sex education in schools, IVF, and gay marriage. There is an obvious problem with Przybyla's argument: the Declaration of Independence. Philosophical debates about \"rights\" aside, the founding document is clear that rights are not derived from man like Przybyla claimed. The Declaration of Independence declares: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. The Founding Fathers, then, were aware of the dangers of a government being empowered to control rights: if the government giveth, then government can taketh. But if fundamental rights are ultimately derived from God, no government can take them. Przybyla comments went viral on Friday afternoon and triggered an avalanche of mockery: - \"Our rights as human beings don’t come from the Constitution, the government, Congress, the president, or the Supreme Court. They are inherent. ... This belief that rights precede government—regardless of whether you believe in God—is fundamental to what it means to be an American,\" former Rep. Justin Amash said . - \"Is someone’s ignorance and religious bigotry showing?\" Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) asked in response. - \"What the state gives the state can take away. What God gives the state takes at its moral peril. Sincerely, The prophets of old,\" Jordan Peterson responded . - \"Human rights come from God. That’s why all human beings have innate value and no human entity has the authority to strip them of those rights. That belief doesn’t make millions of Christians around the world Christian nationalists,\" AND Campaign president Justin Giboney https://twitter.com/JustinEGiboney/status/1761073458253881698. - \"We are all Christian Nationalists now,\" pastor Tom Ascol https://twitter.com/tomascol/status/1761099182020907475. - \"I guess those truths just aren't as self-evident as they used to be,\" National Review writer Dan McLaughlin mocked . - \"This is what secularists want you to believe. If your rights originate from government, then the government is ultimate and statism becomes the dominant belief. But God is ultimate and human rights come from God,\" pastor Grant Castleberry pointed out . - \"Imagine believing your rights come 'from Congress,'\" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1761036886011732071. - \"This is a civics failure, a talent failure, an intelligence failure, a historical failure, an ethics failure...shall I keep going?\" professor Andrew Walker https://twitter.com/andrewtwalk/status/1761036021817315496. - \"I can only suppose that this is what comes of liberal elites living in a bubble. They speak with supreme confidence only to reveal spectacular ignorance--of history, philosophy, the beliefs of the people they regard as their intellectual and moral inferiors and hold in contempt,\" professor Robert George https://twitter.com/McCormickProf/status/1761087207572402329. Przybyla responded to the controversy by gaslighting, claiming she did not say what everyone heard her say. And yet, she somehow also managed to double down. \"While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God,\" she https://twitter.com/HeidiReports/status/1761064510561861962 on social media. \"If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda.\" Like Blaze News?
