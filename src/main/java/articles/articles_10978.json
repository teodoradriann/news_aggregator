    "title": "Rare orange lobster diverted from dinner plate to aquarium by Denver Broncos fans - ABC7 Los Angeles",
    "text": "DENVER, Colo. -- The Downtown Aquarium in Denver has a new resident - a rare orange lobster that was rescued from a shipment of crustaceans delivered to a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado. A long-term employee who is a dishwasher and head biscuit maker spotted the bright orange lobster while unpacking a shipment last Friday and alerted restaurant managers, aquarium officials said. The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos' legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986. \"Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,\" said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager. \"And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.\" When the Pueblo Zoo couldn't take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away. Kastendieck packed Crush with ice packs in a plastic foam container and delivered it to the aquarium on Wednesday. \"As soon as they acclimated him to his quarantine tank at the Denver aquarium, he was very active right off the bat and was really exploring his little area,\" Kastendieck said Thursday. Staff had set up a tank with a new generation Denver Broncos helmet on top and an older generation one sitting in the tank \"so he can actually climb into it and play around it,\" she said. Crush will be examined by a veterinarian and after 30 days in quarantine will be placed in the \"Lurks\" exhibit that houses other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, aquarium staff said. \"We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,\" Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver Downtown Aquarium, said in a statement. Crush was shipped to the Pueblo restaurant from a supplier in Tennessee. It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast. Genetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow. Downtown Aquarium has had one orange lobster previously. The Downtown Aquarium has more than 700 species of fish along with a stingray reef and three Sumatran tigers. ___ Hanson reported from Helena, Montana.",

    "text": "Dana White flinches and security intervene as Leon Edwards lunges at UFC 304 opponent Belal Muhammad Leon Edwards lunged at Belal Muhammad which gave UFC president Dana White a brief scare. Edwards will defend his UFC welterweight title against American challenger Muhammad this Saturday on UK soil at the Co-op Arena in Manchester. The pair met at a press conference to preview their fight and were brought together for a tense final face-off. Immediately, the pair surged forward and went nose-to-nose as security came closer to the pair on red alert in case things became physical. Muhammad made the first move by putting his knuckles up to Rocky's head as if emulating his planned KO blow. Read More In UFC The champion was unfazed, and tried a gag of his own as he jokingly lunged at his opponent in a bid to make him flinch. 'Bully' looked ready to go there and then, but UFC kingpin White was the one that flinched, clearly in fear of a physical altercation causing chaos on stage. Muhammad stayed pretty still, but was clearly wound up and ready to go during their final fighting talk. Luckily he was able to step in between the pair, with Edwards taking a step backwards before security grabbed hold of the fighters. They were bundled their separate ways by the security as tensions simmered, but no further confrontation was able to take place.

It is not the first time that tensions rose between the pair this week, as they got into the same lift at a fighter hotel. As Edwards exited the elevator, a verbal exchange unfolded between the pair, but luckily their teams were on hand to prevent anything from escalating. Edwards goes into the contest as the huge favourite given his undefeated streak and frightening KO record . And current middleweight champion Israel Adesanya believes it will be the Birmingham native who finishes the bout before the final bell. \"Belal's got pressure, man,\" he said. \"He's able to get to people and put his will on them. \"For Leon, just seems like, he's on a massacre right now. He's on a run. I don't think it's gonna be much different [than the Colby Covington fight]. Leon might finish him. \"I think Leon finishes this fight. Trying to think, but I'm trying to see how Belal can win this fight, to get to Leon and wrestling.

    "text": "Maduro celebra fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia y apoya reforma a leyes electorales 0:37 (CNN Español) -- La líder opositora venezolana María Corina Machado criticó este jueves al Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela (TSJ) por validar los resultados de las elecciones del 28 de julio —de las que hasta ahora no se han publicado las actas desglosadas por mesa de votación—, mientras que el presidente Nicolás Maduro defendió la sentencia que ratifica su triunfo y la calificó de “histórica y contundente”.\nEn su cuenta de X, Machado respondió un mensaje del presidente de Uruguay, Luis Lacalle, quien más temprano dijo que el Gobierno de Maduro realiza un “fraude”.\n“Presidente Lacalle, estamos profundamente agradecidos por su solidaridad y apoyo al pueblo venezolano. La acción del TSJ del régimen ratifica lo que todos sabemos: es un brazo de la represión, sin independencia y sin competencia en esta materia. Usurpa funciones del CNE (Consejo Nacional Electoral) con el fin de legitimar lo ‘ilegitimable’”, señaló Machado.\nSin dar detalles, el TSJ convalida anuncio de la victoria de Maduro en las presidenciales de Venezuela “Se vuelven a equivocar. Se hunden y aíslan cada día más. Los venezolanos seguimos adelante con fuerza y convicción, y haremos respetar la soberanía popular. Sabemos que el mundo nos acompaña”, agregó la exdiputada, quien en octubre ganó las primarias de la oposición, pero no pudo registrarse como candidata porque está inhabilitada por cargos que ella rechaza y sostiene que la sanción es ilegal.\nA lo largo de este jueves, al igual que Lacalle, el presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric , y el de Guatemala, Bernardo Arévalo , criticaron el fallo del TSJ y se pronunciaron por luchar por la democracia en Venezuela.\npublicidad La opositora Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD) asegura que el verdadero ganador de los comicios fue Edmundo González, con base en actas que recabaron sus testigos en la mayoría de las mesas en todo el país.\nOPINIÓN | Jorge Castañeda: Maduro sabe que al mostrar las actas pierde la elección 4:26 Maduro: “¡Hágase la paz!” El presidente Maduro celebró la decisión del TSJ, que —dijo— debe ser respetada.\n“Basado en las leyes, como Poder Judicial de la nación, ha emitido una sentencia histórica y contundente, y nosotros decimos, desde las calles de La Guaira y de Venezuela: ¡Santa palabra, hágase la paz, respeto absoluto!”, señaló durante un acto público en el estado La Guaira.\n¿Cuáles son las auditorías que el CNE no hizo tras las elecciones presidenciales en Venezuela? Más temprano, el diputado oficialista Jorge Rodríguez, presidente de la Asamblea Nacional, también dijo que todos los actores políticos deben acatar el fallo del TSJ.\nPor su parte, Simón Calzadilla, secretario general de Movimiento por Venezuela, uno de los partidos que integran la PUD, dijo que el bloque analizará la sentencia con sus abogados para definir sus siguientes pasos.",

Support independent journalism by subscribing to our digital news package. Subscribe now Eskom CEO Dan Marokane says the ability to hit 100 days without load-shedding is 'significant'. File photo.\nImage: Freddy Mavunda\nEskom on Friday celebrated reaching 100 consecutive days without load-shedding, saying this signals a marked improvement in its generation and financial performance.\nThe last time the country enjoyed a prolonged period without load-shedding was from September 8 to December 11 2020.\nThis comes alongside a decrease in the use of open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) to supplement generation capacity. OCGTs are used to help meet high electricity demand during peak times.\n“The 100 days milestone includes around a R6.2bn reduction in OCGT diesel expenditure from April 1 to June 30 2024, compared to the same period last year. If we maintain our trajectory on reduced diesel spend, it will be a strong driver in a possible return to profit in FY25,” said Eskom CEO Dan Marokane.\n“Considering the intensity and levels of load-shedding in 2023, the ability to get to 100 days without load-shedding is significant, while acknowledging the risk of load-shedding continues to exist.”\nBheki Nxumalo, group executive for generation, said: “The achievement of 100 continuous days without load-shedding is the outcome of diligent execution of recovery plans and the tireless efforts of our 40,000 dedicated and skilled Eskom employees.\n“If we maintain a 70% energy availability factor (EAF) and add significant capacity within the country, we can ensure adequate available capacity to meet demand without a significant risk of load-shedding.”\nThe EAF has increased from 54.56% at the end of FY23/24 to a year-to-date achievement of 61.50%, an increase of 6.94% over the past three months.\nEskom said the reprieve was due to its generation operational recovery plan, initiated in March 2023, and aggressive planned maintenance, both made possible by financial support from the National Treasury debt relief scheme for the utility.\n“Our immediate focus remains on implementing the generation operational recovery plan, aiming to recover about 1,600MW from the generation coal fleet after the successful commercial operation of Kusile unit 5 and 930MW from Koeberg unit 2 before the end of the calendar year. This will significantly improve the EAF by the end of March 2025.”\nTimesLIVE",

All parties must have full confidence and give space to the special committee to carry out its role professionally and effectively,” he said in a statement today.\nHe said the findings of the study, as well as views, and suggestions proposed by the special committee, will be presented to MKI and the Conference of Rulers.\nThe special committee, which convened its first meeting on Dec 5, was chaired by former Chief Justice Tun Zaki Tun Azmi.\nMohd Na'im said that all appointed members of the special committee have expertise in the Federal Constitution, and civil and Syariah laws, qualifying them to conduct studies, provide opinions, and make recommendations.\n“This is to ensure that the best and harmonious solutions can be made to resolve all issues arising in this matter to elevate and empower Syariah laws and judiciary system in the country,” he added.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",
