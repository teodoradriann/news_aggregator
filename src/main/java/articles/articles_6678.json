    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death.\nFour models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S.\nHealth Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country.\nThe metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

    "text": "T he British High Commission appreciated the completion of the landmark visit of the United Kingdom's Littoral Response Group (LRG) to India, and stated that it adds a new dimension to the existing UK-India defence partnership. The Littoral Response Group (LRG) arrived in Chennai on March 26 as the first engagement of the UK's deployment to the Indian Ocean region. Littoral Response Group is a UK Royal Navy task group. https://twitter.com/ukdefenceindia/status/1786347283262423434?s=48 In a post on X, Brigadier Nick Sawyer, the Defence Advisor, British High Commission, said, \"Last month, the UK's Littoral Response Group (South) completed a landmark visit to India. The month long deployment was so special and adds a new dimension to the already vibrant maritime pillar of the UK-India defence partnership.\" Further, he appreciated the engagement and stated, \"These activities strengthen the foundation laid for future maritime engagements as part of the 2030 UK-India Roadmap.\" The Littoral Response Group (South) is a multi-functional amphibious task force equipped to undertake a wide spectrum of activity in the littoral environment. It consists of the ships Royal Fleet Auxiliary and RFA Lyme Bay with embarked forces centred on a Royal Marines strike force. This is the first time a Royal Navy vessel will undergo maintenance at an Indian shipyard - a direct result of the logistics-sharing agreement signed between the UK and India in 2022. \"While there have been a record number of Royal Navy ship visits in the past 12 months, a new landmark was achieved this time when the LRG(S) vessels docked at the Larsen and Toubro shipyard in Kattupalli near Chennai,\" Brigadier Nick Sawyer said. Prior to this, the UK task group had conducted maritime exercises with INS Trishul in the Arabian Sea while sailing towards the eastern seaboard of India. This was the first time a Royal Navy vessel underwent essential maintenance in an Indian shipyard a direct result of the logistics-sharing agreement signed between India and the UK in 2022. The logistics-sharing agreement allows for the provision of logistic support, supplies and services between the UK and Indian Armed Forces, for joint training, joint exercises, authorised port visits and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations. This agreement has been a real game changer. It has led to engagements between our armed forces. The vital logistics partnership supports longer deployments of our capabilities in the region and is clear evidence of the Indo-Pacific tilt in action and in sync. In recent deployments, Royal Navy ships have received spare parts manufactured by Indian shipyards within a short notice period, showcasing the growing interoperability between our navies. But it is not just the ships, Royal Air Force flights travelling in the region have benefitted from taking logistic halts in India twice so far, allowing opportunities for our air forces to share best practices and invaluable experiences. Following the completion of the maintenance, RFA Argus and RFA Lyme Bay conducted a maritime exercise in the Bay of Bengal. INS Sahyadri joined the UK Task Group, conducting maritime manoeuvres, aviation, and replenishment serials. Earlier, during Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's UK visit, India and UK agreed that the latter would send its naval groups -- Littoral Response Group and Carrier Strike Group -- to the Indian Ocean Region, in addition to holding multiple joint military exercises and expanding defence cooperation with India. In the coming years, the UK and India will also embark on more complex exercises between their respective militaries, building up to a landmark joint exercise to be conducted before the end of 2030, supporting shared goals of protecting critical trade routes and upholding the international rules-based system, the UK government informed in a release. ✔️ 💕 Found this article helpful?

    "title": "TikTok stars and marketers brace for app's disappearance this month",
    "text": "The impending disappearance of TikTok, one of the most popular social media apps in the United States, has sent marketers, agencies and creators racing to embrace alternatives – even if they’re not entirely convinced that TikTok will in fact exit the United States in January.\nMarketers are shifting dollars to Instagram and amending their contracts with social media stars so they aren’t stuck paying for sponsored TikTok posts in the app’s absence. Creators are pleading with fans to follow them elsewhere while collecting their email addresses to connect on other platforms. And talent agents are telling TikTok stars to hit pause on buying a house or car for now.\n“I’m just hitting 30 million followers, and 10 days from now I might lose it all,” said Mr Joe Mele, 26, a TikTok star from Long Island, New York, who started posting jokes when he was a college freshman. “It’s a little scary.”\nTikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is trying to overturn a law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, that calls for ByteDance to sell the app to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States on Jan 19. TikTok has claimed a sale is impossible and challenged the law as unconstitutional. It will make its last legal argument in the case on Jan 10 before the Supreme Court, after losing its case in a lower court.\nTikTok’s disappearance would upend the social media and marketing landscape, routing billions in advertising dollars to rival platforms like Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube and scattering its 170 million monthly US users. TikTok, known for its video feed that quickly adjusts to users’ interests, has become a cultural juggernaut since 2020, giving rise to bestselling books, viral recipes, Billboard 100 hits and even a “Saturday Night Live” cast member.\n“This will either be the biggest headline-making nonevent in marketing history or the most shock to the system in the last decade,” said Mr Craig Brommers, chief marketing officer of the retailer American Eagle Outfitters.\nSome marketing agencies and creators are taking bigger steps than others to prepare for a potential TikTok ban. Ms Vickie Segar, the founder of Village Marketing, an influencer marketing agency, said her firm’s clients were moving some advertising campaigns to Instagram from TikTok in January so their marketing wouldn’t go dark on Jan 19.\nMs Lisette Sand-Freedman, a founder of Shadow, a marketing and communications agency, recently started adding language to contracts with creators where there could be a “swapping of channels” if TikTok disappeared. So if a brand’s deal with a creator included, say, three TikTok posts and the app stopped operating in the United States, the brand would be able to switch that to posts on Instagram or another platform of its choice, she said. Many creators post short-form videos and other content to multiple platforms.\nIt’s a bad time to be “someone who is just so phenomenal at TikTok but sucks at Instagram,” Ms Sand-Freedman said. “I would probably not cast them in anything big right now. It just wouldn’t make any sense to cross your fingers and pray their content would work somewhere else.”\nStill, many creators and marketers are balancing their very real concerns with a sense of disbelief. There has been talk of a potential TikTok ban since President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, which has “taken the wind out of the sails” of the new law, Ms Segar said.\n“I think we all sort of feel in the back of our heads that it isn’t actually going to happen,” she said.\nTikTok and ByteDance are private and do not publicly disclose their financials. But Mr Brian Wieser, an analyst and founder of the consulting firm Madison and Wall, estimated that TikTok brought in US$8 billion (S$10.9 billion) in US ad sales in 2024, excluding e-commerce, tipping and other ventures.\nCompanies can pay TikTok to run video ads or to send their posts to more viewers. They also often pay to boost posts from creators whom they contract to promote their wares. TikTok also earns a cut of sales from its robust e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, though that initiative has required significant investment from the company in the last year and a half.\nAgencies that manage creators – helping link them with lucrative brand sponsorships, along with book, television and merchandise deals – have long advised their talent to diversify across social platforms. But the TikTok ban has highlighted the broader precarity of social media businesses and in particular the creator economy, which Goldman Sachs projects to grow to $480 billion by 2027.\n“Remember when Myspace was the next big thing?” Mr Brommers said. “Remember when Vine was extremely hot? Remember Clubhouse, remember BeReal? This potential ban is a reminder to me as a marketer that things come and things go, even if this one would be on a scale that none of us have seen.”\n“The brands are going to be OK,” Ms Sand-Freedman said. “It’s all those incredible nobodies who became somebodies and started making real money and building their lives from it, they’re going to be affected.” NYTIMES\nJoin [ST's Telegram channel](https://t.me/TheStraitsTimes) and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

    "text": "Estrenos de cine\nCrítica de 'Corazones rotos': fallido romance criminal\nGilles Lellouche sirve una mezcla de historia de amor juvenil e intriga criminal a la que le sobran minutos y decisiones de dirección arbitrarias\nDesirée de Fez\n'Corazones rotos'\nDirección: Gilles Lellouche\nIntérpretes: Adèle Exarchopoulos, François Civil, Malik Frikah, Mallory Wanecque, Alain Chabat, Vincent Lacoste\nEstreno: 31 de enero de 2025\n★★\n'Corazones rotos' es dos películas en una: un drama sobre una historia de amor dilatada en el tiempo y un 'thriller' criminal. Ninguna acaba de funcionar. Dirigida por el también actor Gilles Lellouche, parte del enamoramiento en la adolescencia de Jackie y Clotaire, imágenes claras de la chica responsable y el chico malo. Su historia, contada en dos momentos distintos, se ve truncada por la criminalidad y el impulso de muerte de Clotaire.\nHay en 'Corazones rotos' una intención loable de darle una dimensión épica a la historia de dos chavales a los que la vida no se lo ha puesto fácil. El romanticismo, teñido de tragedia, con el que Lellouche cuenta su historia de amor tiene encanto. Aunque sea fallido, se intuye el intento de devolverle al romance adolescente la seriedad (salvando muchísimo las distancias) de 'Los amantes de la noche' (1948) o 'Malas tierras' (1973). Esa inclinación épica (si bien no era necesario que la duración fuera igual de épica: dos horas y media) es uno de los atractivos de la película. El otro, la forma en la que está contada la entrada de Clotaire en el mundo criminal.\nSin embargo, se giran varias cosas en contra de 'Corazones rotos'. Las principales, además de su duración, una descripción superficial (y poco generosa) de dos personajes a priori muy atractivos y una dirección dispersa y caprichosa. Hay muchas decisiones de dirección inesperadas (como hacer un plano desde debajo de un charco), pero resultan artificiosas y arbitrarias.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast\nCNN, KION, KPIX, KGO, VENTURA PD AND THE CITY OF VENTURA, SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CHP SANTA CRUZ\nBy Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is\ndriving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
