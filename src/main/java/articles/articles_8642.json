    "text": "Wisconsin Comedian, Charlie Berens has his own brandy…sort of. The spirit, developed by Berens in partnership with Dancing Goat Distillery, pays homage to Charlie’s Grandpa Bob who was influential in Charlie’s career in comedy. “Early on in my comedy days, I was just kinda copying a lot of the things he would say,” Berens tells [Wisconsin’s Midday News](https://wtmj.com/wisconsins-midday-news/). “I don’t know where he picked up some of these phrases, but it’s just poetry.” Berens Old Fashioned Brandy is just that…a brandy. You’ll need to muddle and mix and add the bitters. “You’re gonna have to make your own Old Fashioned with it, but don’t worry because we’ve got the Berens Old Fashioned Brandy channels where we’re going to be doing recipes of – not only Old Fashioneds, but also Manhattan’s,” Berens explained. The label of the 90-proof spirit is bright yellow with red script in a bottle that is squared off by design. “You know when you’re fishing and you kick the bottle over it starts rolling around on the boat, spilling it over? We’ve got an anti-roll spill technology built into this bottle,” Berens continued. “Not only does it fit better into your tackle box, it also has four corners so it’s not going to roll around a boat like a different kind of brandy might.

    "text": "Zxerex announces human studies research study leading to an opioid and fentanyl screening biosignature. SCOTTSDALE, AZ, USA, December 28, 2023 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The National Safety Council has found that workplace impairment due to substances like alcohol, opioids or cannabis, or physical and mental factors, like fatigue and stress, can negatively affect workplace safety, employee well-being, and an employerâs bottom line. With the opioid epidemic and Fentanyl use running rampant, ZXEREXÂ® is pleased to announce its completion of an NIH-funded study on opioids among naive users. This development led the company to develop an opioid impairment biosignature that is being added as another measure of impairment in our suite of impairment detection tools. The companyâs flagship product, IMPAIR-ID powered by ZXEREXÂ® is a non-invasive, rapid, screening technology used to detect temporary neurologic impairment from drugs and fatigue. This research will add to the companyâs earlier success with Cannabis and its unique biosignature of marijuana impairment. The base ZXEREXÂ® drug impairment technology was invented and patented at Arizona State University and the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Among the team are two Nobel-laureate trained neuroscientists and data scientists experienced in machine learning and artificial intelligence. ZXEREXÂ® biosignatures were developed in human studies at highly respected university research centers and then enhanced with machine learning and AI. In addition to a population drug baseline, this screening technology is highly personalized to accurately compare an individualâs current screening test to test results obtained when not impaired. IMPAIR-ID performs rapid, very accurate, non-invasive drug screening and is available 24/7. For use in the workplace or a rehab center, the technology can be used to screen employees, and clients, including especially those at greater risk along with those in safety-sensitive jobs. Medical and safety experts agree that managing impairment risk is all about timely detection. This is of major concern, since urine, saliva, or use of breathalyzers only reveal the chemical presence of a drug or its metabolite, but do not detect its affect on the brain or neurological impairment. IMPAIR-ID is not a direct replacement for tests that detect the presence of a substance when knowing that is important. Since presence is not the same as impairment, systems that detect impairment are needed and become very important in managing risk. Since it is not possible to control risky behavior away from work, being able to rapidly detect impairment when an employee arrives at work and even while there, can help to mitigate risk and serve as a deterrent, particularly for those engaged in safety-sensitive jobs. When combined with an organizationâs safety program, ZXEREX can help reduce injuries and absenteeism while improving productivity. In addition to its cloud-based technology, for larger organizations, ZXEREXÂ® offers impairment training for all levels, including managers/supervisors. Especially with the use of drugs, impairment can delay thinking and reaction time, increase workplace injuries and errors, lead to higher workersâ compensation costs, and increase absenteeism and distraction at work. To learn more about the technology or how you can participate, please contact us at info@zxerex.com.Richard Besserman, MD, CSO ZXEREX CORPORATION +1 480-518-9905 email us here",

Erfolgt darüber ein Einkauf, erhalten wir eine\nProvisionohne Mehrkosten für Sie. Die redaktionelle Auswahl und Bewertung der Produkte bleibt davon unbeeinflusst. Ihr Klick hilft bei der Finanzierung unseres kostenfreien Angebots.\nJacobs steht aktuell im Fokus der Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg – gleich mehrere Produkte der beliebten Marke tauchen auf der Mogelpackungsliste auf. Grund: Versteckte Preiserhöhungen bei Kaffeesticks und Cappuccino-Pulvern durch verkleinerte Füllmengen, geänderte Dosierempfehlungen und ein undurchsichtiges Verpackungsdesign.\nBesonders betroffen sind die Jacobs 3in1- und 2in1-Sticks. Die Verpackung sieht auf den ersten Blick gleich aus – doch bei genauerem Hinsehen wurde die Füllmenge pro Stick von 18 auf 12 Gramm reduziert, während der Preis in vielen Märkten sogar leicht gestiegen ist. Unterm Strich zahlen Verbraucher bei manchen Sorten bis zu 57 Prozent mehr pro Gramm.\nAuch bei Jacobs Cappuccino-Produkten wurde geschrumpft: Die Füllmenge sinkt (von 400 auf 290 Gramm), gleichzeitig wird mehr Pulver pro Portion empfohlen. Ergebnis: Weniger Inhalt, weniger Getränke, höherer Preis.\nJacobs hat die Mogelpackungen des Monats: Das steckt hinter der Kritik\n- Füllmengen teils drastisch reduziert, z. B. von 180 g auf 120 g, ohne transparenten Hinweis auf der Vorderseite\n- Preissteigerungen von bis zu 57 Prozent, obwohl die Verpackung optisch gleich bleibt\n- Veränderte Dosierempfehlungen verschleiern, dass weniger Portionen möglich sind\n- Hersteller argumentiert mit angeblicher „Produktoptimierung“ – durch weniger Zucker und neue Rezepturen\n- Kritiker sprechen von Greenwashing und Taschenspielertricks – vor allem wegen gleich großer Verpackung bei deutlich weniger Inhalt\nOb zuerst die Milch oder der Kaffee in die Tasse kommt, ist für viele Kaffeeliebhaber mehr als nur eine Geschmacksfrage. Tatsächlich beeinflusst die Reihenfolge nicht nur die Temperatur, sondern auch die Aromen Ihres Heißgetränks.\nJacobs-Kaffee: Geringere Qualität zum gleichen Preis\nBesonders kritisch sehen Verbraucherschützer, dass durch die geringere Pulvermenge nun weniger echter Kaffee enthalten ist, dafür aber mehr Aromen zum Einsatz kommen. Das sorge zwar für Geschmack – sei aber ein klassischer Fall von Skimpflation: geringere Qualität zum gleichen Preis.\nJacobs verweist auf sein „Health & Indulgence Programme“, das eine Reduktion von Zucker und Kalorien zum Ziel habe. Doch ein Blick auf die Nährwerttabelle zeigt: Der Zuckergehalt pro 100 Gramm ist sogar gestiegen. Die beworbene Reduktion gilt nur, weil die Portionsgröße kleiner wurde – ein klassischer Taschenspielertrick.\nDerweil senken Lidl und Norma erneut die Preise – dauerhaft und deutschlandweit. Kunden sparen bei Säften, Eistee und Wein teils bis zu 16 Prozent.",

PRESS RELEASE — Natural disasters and incidents of mass violence continue to impact individuals, families and communities. NCDHHS today launched a new, multilingual [Disaster and Behavioral Health Resources Communications Toolkit](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/disaster-and-behavioral-health-resources-communications-toolkit) to provide communities with tips, guidance and resources to support mental and emotional health before, during and after a disaster. \"It’s important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to feel after a natural disaster. The emotional effects can happen immediately or later down the road,\" said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Kody H. Kinsley. \"We want every North Carolinian to have access to the tools and support they need to cope in a healthy way, and to know how to find help now and in the future.\" The new, multilingual [Disaster and Behavioral Health Resources Communications Toolkit](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/disaster-and-behavioral-health-resources-communications-toolkit) provides disaster-specific resources to support the needs of North Carolinians as well as ways to strengthen mental and emotional health. The toolkit includes [fact sheets](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/disaster-and-behavioral-health-resources-communications-toolkit#FactSheets-6117) , [social media posts](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/disaster-and-behavioral-health-resources-communications-toolkit#SocialMediaPosts-6118) and [videos](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/disaster-and-behavioral-health-resources-communications-toolkit#Videos-6120) on how to find mental health resources nearby, online or by phone; navigate stressful events while living with a disability or as a caregiver; access care if someone struggles with substance use; learn safety guidance and more. Several materials are also available in Spanish, Mandarin and Arabic to inform and support more North Carolinians. \"Disasters are a part of life in North Carolina and can impact every community across the state,\" said Kelly Crosbie, MSW, LCSW, Director of the NCDHHS Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Use Services. \"June marks the start of hurricane season and a timely opportunity to share the many resources available to help North Carolinians stay connected, support their mental health and access care while navigating a disaster.\" The toolkit is an important resource for educators, health care providers, caregivers, first responders, crisis response professionals and disaster volunteers to be aware of behavioral health resources and supports available in the community when responding to an emergency or natural disaster. NCDHHS encourages North Carolinians to print or screenshot information from the toolkit for use in personal disaster preparation as well as recovery. The materials include general disaster tips and resources, in addition to mental health services like the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and Disaster Distress Helpline. Share the toolkit with families, friends and colleagues, and make a plan to stay in touch with your loved ones during a disaster. While disasters can happen suddenly, it’s important for everyone to take steps now that will help reduce stress, strengthen mental health and prepare communities to navigate disaster recovery.

Kinsley. \"Queremos que todos los habitantes de Carolina del Norte tengan acceso a las herramientas y el apoyo que necesitan para afrontar la situación de forma saludable y para saber cómo encontrar ayuda ahora y en el futuro\". El nuevo [Kit de Herramientas de Comunicación para Catástrofes y Recursos de Salud Conductual](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/kit-de-herramientas-de-comunicacion-para-catastrofes-y-recursos-de-salud-conductual) multilingüe brinda consejos específicos para desastres, guías y recursos para apoyar las necesidades de los habitantes de Carolina del Norte y maneras de fortalecer la salud mental y emocional. El kit de herramientas incluye [hojas informativas](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/kit-de-herramientas-de-comunicacion-para-catastrofes-y-recursos-de-salud-conductual#HojasInformativas-6146) , [publicaciones para usar en las redes sociales](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/kit-de-herramientas-de-comunicacion-para-catastrofes-y-recursos-de-salud-conductual#Publicacionesparalasredessociales-6147) y [videos](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/kit-de-herramientas-de-comunicacion-para-catastrofes-y-recursos-de-salud-conductual#Videos-6148) sobre cómo encontrar recursos de salud mental, navegar eventos estresantes mientras se vive con discapacidades o como cuidadores, obtener acceso a cuidados si alguien tiene problemas con el uso de sustancias y aprender pautas de seguridad. Varios materiales también están disponibles en español, mandarín y árabe para informar y brindar apoyo a más habitantes de Carolina del Norte. \"Los desastres son parte de la vida en Carolina del Norte y pueden afectar a todas las comunidades del estado\", dijo Kelly Crosbie, MSW, LCSW, directora de la División de Salud Mental, Discapacidades del Desarrollo y Uso de Sustancias de NCDHHS. \"Junio marca el inicio de la temporada de huracanes y con ella la oportunidad de compartir la variedad de recursos disponibles para ayudar a los habitantes de Carolina del Norte a mantenerse conectados, brindar apoyo a su salud mental y a tener acceso a cuidados mientras afrontan un desastre.\" El kit de herramientas es un recurso importante para que los educadores, proveedores de atención médica, cuidadores, personal de auxilio, profesionales de respuesta a crisis y voluntarios en desastres estén al tanto de los recursos y apoyos de salud conductual disponibles en la comunidad al responder a una emergencia o desastre natural. NCDHHS motiva a los habitantes de Carolina del Norte a imprimir o hacer capturas de pantalla de la información del kit de herramientas para usarlo en la preparación y recuperación personal ante desastres. Los materiales incluyen consejos y recursos generales sobre desastres, además de servicios de salud mental como la Línea 988 de Prevención del Suicidio y Crisis y la Línea de Ayuda para los Afectados por Catástrofes. Comparta el kit de herramientas con familiares, amigos y colegas, y haga un plan para mantenerse en contacto con sus seres queridos durante un desastre. Aunque los desastres pueden ocurrir repentinamente, es importante que todos tomen medidas ahora que puedan ayudar a reducir el estrés, fortalecer la salud mental y preparar a las comunidades para afrontar la recuperación ante desastres.

    "text": "Madison woman runs essential errands for people during winter storm MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - While many Wisconsinites are avoiding travel this weekend amidst severe weather, one woman is driving into the storm to help her neighbors. One of the reasons Jenni Cardell moved from Colorado to Wisconsin is for the snow. She adds it’s a great part about living in the state. “I mean, it’s beautiful snow, it’s a heavy snow,” she said. “You know this is, as far as I’m concerned, a great part about living in Wisconsin.” Cardell is the primary care-provider for her aunt who lives with progressive dementia. Already giving up hours of her time to help out, Cardell was inspired to do more. “I know how important it is to be able to have access and get out and around, which is why I bought the snow tires,” she said. “So it just occurred to me this morning that maybe people would have some needs and that I would be able to get out and help somebody.” Cardell posted on a Facebook group ‘Dane County Neighbors Helping Neighbors,’ offering to help anyone in the Madison area in need of a ride. “I mean, as long as I have the availability and, you know, I’ve got a vehicle that is safe compared to a lot of people who don’t have vehicles that are as safe as mine. It’s a big heavy car, big heavy snow tires, dedicated snow tires.” From driving people to the grocery store, to picking up their medications at the pharmacy, requests started coming in, and Cardell hit the road Friday. “If you have the ability to help, you know, put the offer out there and don’t be afraid that, you know, people will ask you things. You can always say no and you can always just say, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing that,’ or ‘I do feel comfortable doing that one.’ You know, just make the offer and know that you can say no.” Cardell says she will continue to offer people help whenever she has free time.

    "text": "Bruselas, 8 mar (EFE).- El secretario general de la OTAN, Jens Stoltenberg, rindió homenaje este viernes a las “innumerables mujeres” que han fortalecido la Alianza desde su creación hace 75 años, y también a las que sufren conflictos, especialmente las ucranianas.\n“Su resistencia, sacrificio y dedicación han sido fundamentales para nuestro éxito. Hemos recorrido un largo camino en la integración de la perspectiva de género en nuestras políticas y operaciones, pero nuestro trabajo está lejos de haber terminado”, indicó Stoltenberg en un vídeo que compartió en las redes sociales con ocasión del Día Internacional de la Mujer.\nEl político noruego lamentó que, con demasiada frecuencia y en demasiados lugares, las mujeres sean las principales víctimas de los conflictos armados.\n“Hoy también rendimos un homenaje especial a las valientes mujeres de Ucrania que siguen luchando por sus familias, su libertad y su futuro”, enfatizó.\nStoltenberg pidió seguir potenciando el papel de la mujer en la seguridad y la defensa, garantizar la igualdad de oportunidades de liderazgo y fomentar una Alianza más justa e integradora.\n“Aprovechar todo el potencial de nuestra gente seguirá fortaleciendo a la OTAN”, concluyó.\nEn el mismo mensaje, el presidente del Comité Militar de la OTAN, Rob Bauer, destacó que desde la primera línea hasta los puestos de mando, las mujeres de las Fuerzas Armadas contribuyen cada día a la eficacia operativa de la OTAN, reforzando su capacidad para proteger a más de mil millones de personas.\n“Hoy reconocemos y expresamos nuestra gratitud a las mujeres que sirven en las misiones y operaciones de la OTAN. Cada vez son más las mujeres que deciden alistarse en las fuerzas armadas aliadas, pero el progreso no va lo bastante rápido”, aseguró.\nEn concreto, pidió más esfuerzos para no solo reclutar sino también retener a las mujeres en los ejércitos, y para integrar la igualdad de género en las operaciones.\nPor su parte, la representante especial del secretario general para Mujeres, Paz y Seguridad, Irene Fellin, subrayó la importancia de trabajar en estrecha colaboración con organizaciones de la sociedad civil y la comunidad internacional para hacer avanzar la agenda de paz y seguridad de las mujeres.\n\"Esta asociación amplifica nuestro impacto, acercándonos a un mundo en el que cada mujer está capacitada para contribuir, inspirar y liderar. Nuestras acciones de hoy sientan las bases para un mañana más justo e inclusivo, en el que las voces de las mujeres se escuchen y sean válidas\", apostilló. EFE\nrja/jaf /alf",

    "text": " Investors are grappling with many questions as the new year approaches: Will stocks continue to climb in 2024? Will the Federal Reserve cut rates? Wharton Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel appeared on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Wednesday to share his predictions for the new year.\nSiegel's Bullish Call: The markets are set to close out 2023 much higher than most expected with the S&P 500 and SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY up nearly 25% year-to-date and the Nasdaq up 35% for the year.\nLooking ahead, Siegel remains bullish on equities. The Wharton professor said he expects the markets to continue to climb next year and noted that we could ultimately close out 2024 up another 10% to 12%. When pressed for more detail, Siegel indicated that it's possible the S&P 500 could reach 5400 by the end of 2024 and 6000 by the end of 2025.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments following the Fed's December meeting showed that Fed policy remains flexible. The central bank indicated that it's open to lowering interest rates , which has helped drive markets higher into the end of the year.\nSiegel told CNBC that \"a soft landing looks increasingly likely,\" adding that market enthusiasm combined with good earnings could drive the market a lot higher in 2024.\nRelated News: If You're Selling The Magnificent 7 Following Outperformance In 2023, You Could Face This 'Nightmare Scenario' In 2024\nLiquidity Concerns: Siegel did voice concerns over the lack of liquidity and stagnation in money supply and argued that the Fed should cut rates to increase liquidity in the market.\nAlthough the Fed has indicated that it remains data dependent, Siegel believes the first rate cut should happen in March.\n“The last thing you want to happen is for him (Powell) to be as stubborn on the way down as he was on the way up two years ago,” Siegel said.\nImage: Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n ",
