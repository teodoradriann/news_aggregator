    "text": "Oposição protocola pedido de impeachment de Lula por ligar ação de Israel a holocausto Brasília e São Paulo\n23/02/2024 15h12\nA oposição ao governo protocolou o pedido de impeachment do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) na Câmara. O requerimento, com 139 assinaturas, está na mesa de Arthur Lira (PP-AL), presidente da Casa, desde a noite de quinta-feira, 22. Encabeçado pela deputada Carla Zambelli (PL-SP), o requerimento deve passar por um aditamento para inclusão de mais cinco nomes.\nO requerimento possui 49 páginas e afirma que o presidente da República cometeu \"ato de hostilidade contra Israel\" por meio de \"declarações de cunho antissemita\". No último domingo, 18, Lula comparou a incursão de Israel na Faixa de Gaza com o extermínio de judeus promovido pela Alemanha nazista.\nA declaração de Lula gerou uma crise diplomática, fator elencado pelos autores do pedido. Segundo os parlamentares, o chefe do Executivo teria comprometido as relações comerciais entre Brasil e Israel e a neutralidade brasileira, crimes de responsabilidade tipificados pela Lei do Impeachment.\nPor erro técnico no protocolo do pedido, o requerimento que chegou na mesa de Lira abriga 139 assinaturas, sem acumular todos os signatários da medida, segundo Zambelli. Nesta segunda-feira, 26, será feito um aditamento para a inclusão das assinaturas dos deputados Pedro Lupion (PP-PR), Giacobo (PL-PR), Sargento Portugal (Podemos-RJ), Alex Santana (Republicanos-BA) e Lúcio Mosquini (MDB-RO).\nZambelli quer incluir também a alegação de que Lula \"procedeu de modo incompatível com o decoro do cargo\", outro argumento para fundamentar o impedimento do presidente da República. A deputada afirmou que será realizado na semana que vem uma solenidade para o anúncio oficial da iniciativa.\n'Superpoder' de Lira\nO pedido, a partir de agora, depende exclusivamente de Arthur Lira para avançar. Segundo Flávio de Leão Bastos, doutor em Direito Constitucional e professor universitário do Mackenzie, o número absoluto de assinaturas no requerimento, em si, \"não é tão importante\", apesar de indicarem mobilização política.\nNo fim das contas, como ocorre a partir desta etapa, a abertura do processo de impeachment compete unicamente a Lira, \"havendo 50, cem ou mil assinaturas\", explica o professor. \"É um poder exclusivo, um 'superpoder', como alguns denominam, do presidente da Casa\", disse Leão Bastos.\nZambelli quer que um terço da Câmara assine o pedido\nZambelli afirmou por meio das redes sociais que espera contar com mais adesões no requerimento. \"Se Deus quiser vamos chegar a 171, que é um terço da Câmara, um número bastante expressivo\", disse a deputada no X (antigo Twitter).\nA maior parte dos deputados que aderiram ao pedido de impeachment é filiada ao PL, partido do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro e principal legenda de oposição ao governo Lula. Mas até parlamentares de siglas que integram a base governista, como União Brasil, PSD e MDB, constam entre os apoiadores do requerimento. Isso ocorre pois os partidos integram ministérios do governo federal, mas os deputados, a nível individual, atuam na oposição a Lula.\nAs mais lidas agora Laxante natural para soltar intestino preso: veja como preparar a bebida Suco ideal para eliminar fezes sem dor: veja receita para soltar intestino PIS ANO-BASE 2023 CAI NESTA SEMANA ANTECIPADO?

    "title": "Mom Fights Oregon After State Prevents Her From Adopting Because She’s a Christian - LifeNews.com",
    "text": "A single mother of five is fighting the Oregon Department of Human Services denying her adoption application due to her religious beliefs.\nJessica Bates, a Christian mom who lost her husband in a car crash six years ago, attempted to apply with the department to adopt children in 2022. Oregon officials denied Bates’ application because her Christian beliefs would not allow her to “respect, accept, and support … the sexual orientation, gender identity, [and] gender expression” of the children in her care as the department’s adoption regulations require, according to a lawsuit brought by Alliance Defending Freedom.\nThe 41-page lawsuit explained that Bates hoped to adopt a “sibling pair” that are both under the age of 10 and began applying in March 2022. Bates said that during the trainings for the adoption she “realized that her faith might conflict with some of the Department’s expectations for adoptive parents.”\nDuring one of the trainings, an instructor noted that Oregon law required adoptive parents to “affirm” a child’s gender identity, sexual orientation and preferred pronouns, according to the lawsuit. Prospective parents are also barred from sharing beliefs that do not promote these values.\nA lower court ruled against her and now Bates is appealing to the 9th Circuit to allow Bates to access Oregon’s adoption system free of discrimination while her lawsuit continues so that she can provide a loving home to children in need.\nHELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation !\n“No state should abandon children in favor of a dangerous ideological agenda,” said ADF Legal Counsel Johannes Widmalm-Delphonse. “Jessica is a loving mother who feels called to adopt siblings under the age of 10 from foster care. But the state of Oregon is categorically excluding her from adopting any child because Jessica shares a view held by millions of Americans: that boys and girls are biologically different and should cherish that difference, not reject it. Because Jessica will not promote Oregon’s radical gender ideology to children under the age of 10, the state considers her an unfit parent and has deprived hundreds, if not thousands, of children in Oregon’s system of the opportunity to be raised in a loving home. We urge the 9th Circuit to allow Jessica to continue her adoption journey and provide a loving home to children in need.”\nAlthough Jessica repeatedly told ODHS officials that she would happily love and accept any child placed with her, officials still rejected her application, making her ineligible to adopt any child—even children who share Jessica’s religious beliefs. ODHS’s policy needlessly penalizes Bates and many other people of faith for their religious views, compels parents to speak words that violate their conscience, and deprives religious families of equal protection of the law because of their faith.\nBates, who lost her husband in a car collision six years ago, is a mother of five children, ages 10 to 18. Inspired by the story of a man who adopted a child from foster care, Bates felt a calling to follow the biblical teaching to care for orphans. State officials, however, rejected her application because she refused to abandon her religious beliefs.",

    "title": "GitHub chief faces extensive backlash after he said, \"Use AI or...\" - Times of India",
    "text": "GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has sparked a frenzy of controversy in the international developer community following his announcement that developers would need to adapt to artificial intelligence (AI) or exit the industry altogether.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Dohmke contended that AI is no longer a voluntary tool but a core competence for anybody working in software development. His stark message- \"Use AI or quit coding\", which he stated in his blog post on August 3, 2025, and was also posted on his LinkedIn account. What was his argument? Thomas Dohmke thinks the developer's job is experiencing a seismic shift. In his opinion, the transition is away from being a hands-on coding expert to being a \"creative director of code,\" choreographing AI tools instead of writing every line by hand.\nHe believes, AI systems like GitHub Copilot will write most of the code, while humans concentrate on architecture, direction, and quality assurance.\nHe quotes his conversations with developers who are already deeply dependent on AI, reporting their work has been revolutionized by gains in efficiency and in solving higher-level problems. He forecasts that within two to five years, as much as 90 percent of code will be coded by AI, and so AI literacy will become a fundamental competency for the profession.\nIs the push necessary? For Dohmke, the logic is simple: adopting AI early would keep them competitive, while delaying it might cause them to stagnate or become obsolete. He positions AI as a productivity accelerator, liberating developers from boilerplate code and giving them more time to focus on design and innovation. This isn't, he insists, about substituting for humans but redefining their role. Rather than spend too much time bogged down in syntax and debugging, next-generation developers will coach AI to create strong, efficient, and secure code — a job that involves critical thinking, domain knowledge, and comprehension of how AI models work.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Backlash from the community Despite his intentions, the message has drawn sharp criticism. Many developers view it as unnecessarily combative and anxiety-inducing, especially in an industry already dealing with automation fears. The framing of “embrace AI or quit” has been accused of being a scare tactic, suggesting a future where those unwilling or unable to adapt are simply discarded. It also draws critics' attention to the practical dangers. Code produced by AI may harbor bugs or security vulnerabilities, and relying on such code without adequate checks could introduce serious vulnerabilities. Others contend that forcing AI adoption so vigorously overlooks the value of human hands-on control and craftsmanship in coding. Credit: Linkedin Risks and benefits There is no question that AI solutions such as GitHub Copilot have proven quantifiable productivity gains, with certain research indicating a 50 percent decrease in time on mundane coding tasks.\nFor some, AI is a creative collaborator, suggesting ideas, detecting mistakes, and speeding up processes. Whether his words were intended to provoke or motivate, the dialogue it has generated is one the industry can't afford to ignore. Developers are presented now with a dilemma: embed AI deeply into processes or risk being displaced by those who do. For some, it's an inspiring challenge; for others, it's a corporate dictate that brooks little argument. The message is unambiguous: the age of AI-driven work, whether it's coding or writing, has arrived! The sooner we understand, the better it is for us, and those who are unwilling to accept it may find themselves on the outside looking in. \"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2 .\"\nAbout the Author TOI Lifestyle Desk The TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

    "text": "DELTA — A truck carrying what appears to be heavy construction material has smashed into an overpass in Delta, British Columbia, shutting down the southbound lanes of Highway 99.\nIt's the latest in a rash of overpass collisions that prompted the province to announce harsher penalties for companies and drivers with repeat offences earlier this month.\nDrive BC says the incident south of Vancouver has also blocked traffic in both directions on the 112th Street overpass.\nDelta Fire and Rescue Deputy Chief Dave Wood says the crash caused a \"secondary accident\" involving another vehicle.\nHe says crews were called to the scene at 12:14 p.m. and he didn't know of any injuries.\nPhotos of the aftermath of the incident posted on social media show large girders on the bed of a truck with another laying across the highway along with other debris.\nProvincial statistics say as many as 30 bridge strikes have happened on British Columbia's highways since 2021, with 16 of them reported last year alone.\nThe new rules, announced Dec. 14, include the requirement for dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by next June, telling drivers if their trailer hasn't been lowered.\nOver-height vehicle fines will increase to $575, up from $115.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",
