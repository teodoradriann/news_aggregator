    "title": "David Foenkinos : C'est une infection de la plèvre qui a fait basculer la vie de cet auteur à succès",
    "text": "David Foenkinos est l'\nun des plus grands romanciers français contemporains. Trois de ses livres ont même été brillamment adaptés au cinéma : La Délicatesse (2011), qu'il a lui-même co-réalisé avec son frère Stéphane Foenkinos, Les souvenirs (2014), mis en scène par Jean-Paul Rouve, et Le Mystère Henri Pick (2019), adapté par Rémi Bezançon. S'il bat des records de ventes, dans les librairies, à chaque fois qu'il sort un nouveau livre, David Foenkinos est relativement discret, sur sa vie privée. Mais dans les colonnes du Parisien, le 18 février 2025, on en a appris un peu plus sur une douloureuse expérience, qui a construit ce romancier à succès... Une expérience qui l'a radicalement changé.\nComme son héroïne, dans son dernier roman Tout le monde aime Clara (Gallimard), David Foenkinos, a vécu \"une adolescence hospitalisée\". Tandis qu'il avait 16 ans, les médecins découvrent en effet que le futur auteur souffre d'une infection de la plèvre, la membrane située entre les poumons et la cage thoracique. \"Il est envoyé aux urgences, et avant de subir une lourde opération, il se sent partir, raconte Le Parisien. Mourir. Mais la vie revient.\" Après cette expérience traumatisante, David Foenkinos ne sera plus tout à fait le même...\n\"Après une expérience de mort et de longs mois à l'hôpital, sans téléphone, ni Internet, on ne regarde plus la vie de la même façon\", confie-t-il au quotidien. Si, jusqu'alors, le jeune homme était passionné de\nfootball, lors de son séjour médicalisé, il a commencé à dévorer des tas de livres, lui qui n'aimait pas lire... Mieux, une fois tiré d'affaire, le jeune David Foenkinos va au musée, se met à la peinture et la guitare. Un autre homme ! \"La maladie a déverrouillé ma sensibilité, assure l'auteur de La Délicatesse au Parisien. J'avais besoin de beauté. Je voulais tout connaître, tout savoir.\" Et il s'est mis à écrire, à écrire... Sans cette mésaventure qui l'a cloué sur un lit, David Foenkinos ne serait peut-être pas l'auteur qu'il est aujourd'hui.\nEt quel auteur ! David Foenkinos fait partie des plus gros vendeurs de romans en France, et ses œuvres sont traduites dans une quarantaine de langues, partout dans le monde. Il a reçu de nombreux prix, en particulier pour La Délicatesse, sacré Prix des Dunes et Prix des lecteurs du Télégramme en 2011, et Charlotte, Prix Renaudot et Prix Goncourt des lycéens en 2014.",

    "text": "A G4 geomagnetic storm is currently ongoing, which means it is very likely that we will see the aurora borealis tonight where skies are clear. The clearest skies tonight will be in north-central Montana where mostly clear skies are forecasted. Around Helena, it is going to be partly cloudy tonight. If you are going to head out to see the northern lights tonight, make sure you take a couple layers with you as it will be chilly with lows getting down into the 30s and low 40s. Also, just a reminder, for the best viewing, get away from city lights and have a clear view to the north. At this time, the northern lights should be visible throughout the entire night, but they will be strongest prior to midnight. It is also going to continue to be hazy tonight around Helena. For tomorrow, we are going to have partly cloudy skies with a couple isolated showers around. We are also going to have increasing haze tomorrow in portions of north-central Montana, and it is going to be hazy/smoky throughout the day tomorrow around Helena, and at times the air quality may be unhealthy for sensitive groups. It is also going to be mild tomorrow as highs are going to be in the mid to upper 60s and low 70s. There is also going to be a breeze around tomorrow along the Rocky Mountain Front and in eastern portions of north-central Montana as sustained wind speeds are going to be between 10 and 20 mph. We are then going to have beautiful weather this weekend as we are going to have mainly sunny skies, dry conditions, little wind, and pleasant temperatures as highs are going to be in the 60s and low 70s on Saturday and the mid to upper 60s and low to mid 70s on Sunday. Definitely make sure you spend some time outdoors this weekend! It is also going to continue to be hazy in some areas this weekend, especially in southwestern Montana. Lots of sunshine, mainly dry conditions, and above average temperatures (highs in the 70s and low 80s) are then expected on Monday and Tuesday as an upper-level ridge is going to be in control of our weather. We are then going to have increasing clouds on Wednesday with highs in the mid to upper 60s and low to mid 70s. It is also going to be a little breezy in some areas on these three days as sustained wind speeds are going to be between 5 and 20 mph. On Thursday, we are going to have partly cloudy skies with a chance of rain and mountain snow showers as a cold front passes through our area. It is also going to be cooler and windier on Thursday as highs are going to be in the 50s and low 60s, and sustained wind speeds are going to be between 10 and 30 mph.",

    "text": "LA Times Facing extreme weather, dangerous loneliness, Wrightwood youth connect with elderly neighbors Grace Toohey January 1, 2024 at 3:42 PM · 7 min read Link Copied Read full article Children from the Zamora family — Jax, 9, left; Mason, 7, rear; Evan, 7, and Drew, 7 — give a goodbye hug to neighbor Eva Jablonsky following a visit. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\nThe four boys come bounding into Eva Jablonsky’s otherwise quiet living room.\nMissy, her mini poodle, marks their arrival with a chorus of barks, but her yips are soon drowned out by the cacophony of children.\nAlmost instantly, a new energy envelops the 88-year-old's home — one that only three 7-year-olds and a 9-year-old can create. They sing an off-the-cuff version of Pete the Cat's shoe song , talk over each other about who the best soccer player is (Lionel Messi is the GOAT, or \"greatest of all time,\" they decide), and jockey for the best spot on Jablonsky's worn couch.\n“They are just the most darling kids,\" Jablonsky said, smiling as the four boys — their sister is home sick this winter afternoon — comfortably greet her by her first name.\nHard of hearing, Jablonsky often misses some of the boys' chatter, but she's happy to sit and enjoy their antics, absorbing the carefree joy they seem to radiate.\n“I love it, I love it,\" said Jablonsky, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who now rarely leaves home because of her unsteady feet. \"I’m a people person and I miss having people in and out of my house.\"\nRead more: Snowed in: Can the SoCal mountains survive climate change?\nThat's precisely the goal of a new program at Wrightwood Elementary School that aims to connect students with their elderly neighbors — not only to provide much-needed company during the nation's ongoing loneliness epidemic , but to give seniors another support system and perhaps even a lifeline as the San Bernardino County mountain town faces increasingly extreme weather .\nOn top of all that, there are also proven health benefits for seniors who play with young kids.\nThe arrangement has formally cemented the relationship between Jablonsky and Michelle Zamora's family of seven — her second-grade quadruplets, fourth-grade son and husband.\nWrightwood Elementary School's Golden Raccoon program has families \"adopting\" senior citizens in the community. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\nThe Golden Raccoon program, a play on the school's mammalian mascot, \"was really born out of last winter,\" said Principal John Garner. \"For at least a week, there were a lot of us that were homebound ... I was struggling digging out all that snow, and I can’t imagine being 80 or 90 years old.”\nIt was last winter that a historic blizzard blasted Southern California's mountains and buried numerous communities, including Wrightwood, under feet of snow.\nMany people lost power for days and plows took even longer to clear many roadways. While Wrightwood fared comparatively better than other mountain towns, the storms wreaked havoc across the San Bernardino peaks, damaging homes and trapping residents — some of whom were later found dead .\nThe Zamora family, in the home on the right, adopted their senior citizen neighbor Eva Jablonsky, who lives in the house on the left, as part of Wrightwood Elementary School's Golden Raccoon program. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\"It made me think about how we might, as a school, be able to build a system or a network where these senior citizens are checked on,\" Garner said.\nAnd so the Golden Raccoon program was born, with 35 local families \"adopting\" a senior neighbor in 2023. The hope is even more will join in the coming months.\n“When times are calm, you might bring them dinner or invite them over for dinner or go play a game with them,\" Garner said. \"But then when there’s a crisis, whether that’s a big snowstorm or we’ve had power outages … make sure you check on your Golden Raccoon.”\nThe concept isn't new. Students across the state have participated in similar programs and even worldwide charities have encouraged such intergenerational relationships .\nBut it's particularly pertinent in Wrightwood. About 30% of the 4,400 people who call the 6-square-mile community home are 65 or older, a rate twice as high as the statewide figure and significantly above San Bernardino County's other mountain communities, according to the latest census data.\nRead more: 'A shameful situation': Angry mountain residents trapped by snow ask why help took so long\nThe requirements for the Golden Raccoon program are flexible, Garner said, with the option for families to reach out to a neighbor, friend or even relative. For the Zamoras, it was an easy choice, as they have been close to Jablonsky since the family moved in next door in 2017.\n“She was our Golden Raccoon before they named them the Golden Raccoons, but we’re hoping more people get the message to check on [their neighbors], especially up here,\" Zamora said.\nJust in the last few years, she said they've dealt with floods, fires and snowstorms — challenging enough for anyone living on their own, but especially so for someone who might have mobility issues or not be competent with technology. They make sure to always shovel Jablonsky's driveway when it snows, Zamora said, and provide her with relevant information when power or cell service fails.\nIn warmer months, Jablonsky often sits out on her front deck to watch the family's five children ride bikes or play sports. But it's harder to stay connected when temperatures fall, the retired detective said.\nSo visits have become a highlight, whether it's getting help from her personal \"tech support,\" 9-year-old Jax, or exchanging holiday gifts with the family.\n“These are my adopted grandkids,\" Jablonsky said, pulling Jax up onto her lap while three of the four quadruplets piled around her feet. She tells them how she had a small farm in Rowland Heights, complete with goats and chickens, before she moved to Wrightwood.\nThe kids are fascinated by that idea.\n\"That would be so fun meeting chickens,\" said 7-year-old Mason, who wore a matching yellow sweater with his fellow quadruplets.\n\"If I had a farm, I would have 100 dogs!\" Jax added. \"And then I would have cats to eat the mice.\"\nEvan and Drew, the other younger brothers, chime in: “What if the mice are faster than the cats?”\nThen: “Mason’s a mouse!”\nThe boys giggle. Jablonsky and their mom can't help but join in.\nOther Wrightwood families are forging new relationships with elderly neighbors they had somehow never met, even in the small town. The program connected Chris Hirschman and his four kids — three of whom are students at Wrightwood Elementary — to a woman who recently lost her husband to cancer. They've tried to provide some new bright spots in her life, Hirschman said.\nThe Golden Raccoon program was created by the principal of Wrightwood Elementary School, the mascot of which is a raccoon. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n“We’re getting to know her,\" he said. His kids have enjoyed playing with her dogs and this holiday season gifted her homemade Christmas cookies and an ornament. When the family realized their Golden Raccoon didn't have a tree, the Hirschmans quickly remedied that, delivering a fresh conifer.\n\"It's the community helping itself,\" Hirschman said. \"We have a lot of people that could use some help, sometimes just a hello, just a visit.\"\nHis 8-year-old daughter Dorothy has particularly taken to their Golden Raccoon, and hoped to spend some of New Year's Eve with her, maybe watch a movie.\n\"I think she would really like that,\" Dorothy said.\nGarner and the families involved are hopeful the program will continue to expand, and are working to find ways that seniors could request a pairing, as well as include Golden Raccoons in school events, like talent shows, assemblies and story time.\nThe Zamora family — Jax, 9, left; mom Michelle; Drew, 7; Evan, 7, and Mason, 7, visit their \"adopted\" neighbor Eva Jablonsky. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\"What we’re trying to instill in the kids is they have the power to make the world a better place,” Garner said.\nIt seems to be resonating.\nBefore the Zamora children leave Jablonsky's house, they each give her a big hug, draping their little bodies over her armchair.\n“She’s a part of our family now, huh?\" Michelle Zamora said. Her kids have their own grandparents, and Jablonsky her own grandkids, but there's something special about living so close and getting to share so much of day-to-day life.\n“Love you,” the boys tell Jablonsky as they pile on.\n“I love you too,\" she replied. \"'Bye, kids.\"\n“I’ll miss you,” Mason sing-songs on his way out.\nJablonsky smiles. She'll probably miss them more, but she knows they'll be back — just never soon enough.\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "title": "Saudi Arabia employs highest number of Sri Lankan workers in 2023 - DailyNews",
    "text": "Saudi Arabia has ranked first in providing work opportunities to Sri Lankan expats in 2023, as more than 63,000 of them found employment in the Kingdom. Every year, more than 200,000 migrant workers leave Sri Lanka to work abroad. They are a main source of foreign exchange for the country, which since last year was gripped by its worst ever financial crisis. P.M. Amza, Sri Lanka’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, estimated that in 2023 remittances amounted to over $7 billion, of which a significant portion was contributed by expat workers in the Kingdom. “During the year 2023, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become the number one country, generating 63,000 employment (opportunities) for Sri Lankans,” he told Arab News on Saturday. “Of the annual remittances amounting to $7-8 billion a year, a sizable portion has been generated from the Kingdom, which is in the region of 15 to 20 percent of the total remittances.” Gulf Cooperation Council countries are a preferred choice for Sri Lankan workers, with Saudi Arabia being their key destination, lately also attracting skilled professionals to its megaprojects under Vision 2030. These projects, in addition to a new employment scheme under the Skill Verification Program, were the main factors making the Kingdom increasingly attractive to Sri Lankans, according to Amza. The SVP agreement signed in March aims to improve the professional competence of employees in the Saudi labor market and ease the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation. Under the deal — which covers 23 professions — Saudi employers recognize accreditations issued by Sri Lanka’s Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. “The year 2023 has seen the qualitative and quantitative increase of employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in the Kingdom,” Amza said, adding that while half of Sri Lankan expats have been employed in the domestic sector, this year showed growth in the number of those working in the construction and hospitality sector. “The signing of the agreement on the Skill Verification Program between the two countries has also contributed to this increase of skill and professional categories of employment, which stood as nearly 12,000 during 2023.” Source: Arab News",

    "title": "‘Not Ready For Primetime’: DeSantis Criticizes Nikki Haley’s Response To Civil War Question | The Daily Caller",
    "text": "Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized primary opponent Nikki Haley over her response to a question about the cause of the Civil War.\nHaley told a questioner at a campaign event on Wednesday that the Civil War was the result of a dispute over “how [the] government was going to run.” She received intense backlash for failing to mention slavery.\nDeSantis described the former South Carolina governor’s response as an “incomprehensible word salad” that badly mispepresented American history.\n“You know, I noticed that Nikki Haley has had some problems with some basic American history,” DeSantis told reporters Thursday. “You know, she was asked a very simple question and responded with just a really incomprehensible word salad … and now is taking different positions and this.”\n“I just think that this shows this is not a candidate that’s ready for primetime,” he continued. “She’s gotten a pretty free ride from a lot of the corporate press. The minute that she faces any type of scrutiny, she tends to cave, and I think that that’s what you saw yesterday. [It’s] not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War, and yet that seemed to be something that was really difficult and I don’t even know what she was saying if you listen to that answer. I know she’s trying to clean it up, I know she’s tried to blame a Democrat plant.\n“Look, I mean, you’re gonna be asked a lot of questions,” he added. “You’re gonna be asked a lot of tough questions, that’s just the nature of this business and I think she showed time and time again, when the lights get hot, that she wilts under pressure and that was a good example last night.”\nDuring a Thursday appearance on a New Hampshire radio show, Haley said she tried to explain what the causes of the Civil War mean “to us” in 21st-century America. She then accused the town hall attendee who asked the question of being a “Democrat plant.” (RELATED: MSNBC Guest Somehow Finds A Way To Blame Trump For Nikki Haley’s Slavery Comments)\n“Why are they hitting me?” Haley said. “See this for what it is … They want to run against Trump. In town halls, I answer every question, and they are planting questions there … It was definitely a Democrat plant. When I asked him, he didn’t want to answer. He didn’t give reporters his name.”\nDeSantis told reporters Thursday that slavery absolutely played a major role in causing the Civil War and credited the Republican Party with abolishing slavery.\n“Of course, you have the issue of slavery, you had the states that were concerned about Lincoln interfering and potentially eliminating it, and they viewed it as a states rights issue, not as a federal issue, and they were concerned that you have this Republican president who may come in and get rid of the institution of slavery” DeSantis said, according to footage posted by CBS political reporter Aaron Navarro. “It’s interesting, because the Republican Party was founded to put a stop to the growth of slavery in this country and the abolition of slavery to this day remains the party’s top achievement.”\nAsked how he would’ve answered the initial voter Q Haley got, about what the cause of the Civil War was, DeSantis replied, “of course, you have the issue of slavery”\nHe then said the “abolition of slavery— to this day, remains the [Republican] party’s top achievement.” pic.twitter.com/cW7PtpCiSq\n— aaron navarro (@aaronlarnavarro) December 28, 2023\nHaley is currently polling at 24.8 percent in New Hampshire, trailing only former President Donald Trump, who sits at 46.3 percent, according to RealClearPolitics. DeSantis is polling in fourth place at 9.5 percent, behind former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.",

    "title": "Boeing factory workers begin strike action",
    "text": "The News Tens of thousands of Boeing factory workers went on strike Friday for the first time since 2008, after rejecting a deal that included a 25% pay increase over four years, in another blow to the company amid safety concerns and a growing debt burden. “ [The message was clear](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jlj3dnlw7o) that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” Boeing said in a statement, in reference to the almost 95% of union members who rejected the pay deal. The company said it was ready to go back to the negotiating table and reach a new agreement. The strike is unlikely to immediately disrupt commercial flights, but is expected to halt production of its commercial airplanes. The walkout comes a month after aerospace industry veteran and engineer Kelly Ortberg took over as Boeing’s chief executive. Boeing’s strike is the latest in a series of labor actions that surged in 2023 in what was dubbed as ” [hot labor summer](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-historic-battles-of-hot-labor-summer).” Supply chain issues brought on by the pandemic significantly upended companies’ relationship with employees, Bloomberg’s Industrial Strength newsletter wrote: “Unions have realized that they are the ones with the leverage — not the companies — and [they’re pushing it to their advantage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/boeing-ba-worker-strike-underscores-new-normal-for-industrial-labor-relations).”",

    "title": "Foods you should never put into a lunchbox - including 'healthy' options",
    "text": "As the summer holidays draw to an end, it's almost time to hit the shops for school uniforms and packed lunches. While it’s important to ensure your child’s lunchbox is filled with nutritious options, it’s equally crucial to consider the impact of certain foods on their teeth, experts say.\nIt can be hard to distinguish what is healthy for your child's packed lunch. With certain packaging misleading, some seemingly harmless snacks can be harmful to your child's teeth in the long run.\nDr Smita Mehra, BDS MFGDPRCS, Principal Dentist at\nThe Neem Tree Dental Practice, has compiled a list of 10 foods to avoid putting in your kids' packed lunch.\nSweetened Granola Bars\nOften, when we see granola bars on supermarket shelves, we associate them with healthy eating. But some of your favourite snack bars can contain a lot more sugar than you may think. The sticky nature of many sweetened granola bars means they can easily stick to the crevices of your teeth, making it difficult for saliva to wash away the sugar and particles.\nThe prolonged exposure of your teeth to sugars increases the risk of decay, especially in hard-to-reach areas like between teeth or in grooves.\nRaisins\nSimilarly to some granola bars, they are high in sugar and can easily stick to your child's teeth and in between grooves. Because raisins stick to teeth, they can stick to different parts of the mouth for the rest of the school day. If this happens regularly, your child may develop cavities since the sugar remains in contact with the teeth for an extended period.\nAlternatively, offer fresh fruit, which tends to be less sticky and contains more water to help dilute sugars.\nOranges\nWhile oranges are nutritious and packed with vitamin C, similarly to other fruits like lemons and grapefruit, they can be a bad choice for your teeth when consumed frequently or in large quantities due to their high acidity.\nIf your child consumes oranges regularly in their packed lunch or sips on orange juice throughout the day, their teeth will be exposed to acid more frequently. This consistent acidity can wear down the enamel, which is the protective outer layer of your teeth.\nPretzels\nPretzels are high in refined starches. When chewed, they break down into sugars and contribute to oral bacteria. As most pretzels are typically salty, they can dry out your mouth and absorb moisture. A dry mouth means less saliva, which is essential for neutralising acids and washing away food particles that may contribute to cavities.\nCereal\nAlthough some cereals can typically be branded as healthy, they contain hidden sugars under names like sucrose, fructose, or corn syrup, which still contribute to tooth decay.\nSome cereals can be packed dry for your child to snack on during the day, but for those that may attend a breakfast club, when eaten with milk, cereals can become a sugary, sticky mixture that clings to teeth. While milk is not harmful to your child's teeth, it can mix with the sugars and starches, making your mouth more acidic.\nFruit winders\nFruit winders are often made with concentrated fruit juices or added sugars, which can be bad for your child's teeth if exposed to them throughout the school day. Not only are they full of sugar, but the texture of fruit roll-ups is often sticky.\nThis stickiness allows the sugars to remain in contact with your teeth for a longer period, meaning the oral bacteria have more time to produce acids that damage enamel.\nWhite-breaded sandwiches\nWhite bread is made from refined flour, which is high in simple carbohydrates. The carbs turn to sugar quickly in the mouth, feeding bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition to this, when white bread is chewed, it often becomes soft and sticky, forming a paste-like consistency.\nWhen your child is eating a sandwich with white bread, it can stick to the roof of their mouth or in between their teeth, which can be bad for their teeth if not washed down with water.\nInstead, you can opt for whole-grain bread instead of white bread. Whole grains contain more fibre, which is less likely to stick to teeth and provides additional nutrients that can protect teeth.\nLollipops\nLollipops are made up of mostly sugar, and unlike other sweets, they are often licked or sucked and take a longer time to consume. Because they take much longer to eat the sugar is in contact with your teeth for a longer time, increasing the risk of decay.\nAs some lollipops can be hard to chew, if your child bites down on them, it can risk damaging or breaking teeth.\nCrisps\nCrisps can be greasy and can leave a residue that sticks to the surface of your teeth, which can be difficult to remove and can contribute to plaque buildup.\nSome crisps can have sharp edges that may scratch or irritate your gums and the inside of your mouth. While this might not directly harm your teeth, it can lead to gum problems and increase the risk of infection.\nThey lack nutrients that can help protect your teeth, such as calcium or fibre, which can help you maintain strong teeth and promote overall oral health.\nCaramel popcorn\nThe caramel that layers the popcorn can easily stick to your child's teeth and gums, and the sugar within the caramel feeds bacteria in your mouth, leading to acid production that erodes tooth enamel and causes cavities.\nIf you do choose to pack caramel popcorn, your child must rinse their mouth with water to help wash away some of the sticky residue and sugar.",

Muchas veces a lo mejor queremos resolver y salvar el mundo solos, pero la realidad es que también con pequeñas acciones se logran cambios\", dijo en entrevista con la AFP. Entre banderas palestinas, la joven recorrió las tiendas de campaña instaladas desde el jueves en el enorme jardín central de la máxima casa de estudios del país, localizada en el sur de Ciudad de México. La rectoría de la UNAM emitió un comunicado en el que reconoce que el campamento propalestinos se colocó de \"manera respetuosa y ordenada\" y adelantó que será respetado siempre y cuando no atente contra el orden y los derechos de otros universitarios. Frida participó en una asamblea estudiantil, en la que no se permitieron cámaras, mientras decenas de manifestantes estaban resguardados en las tiendas de campaña ante el sol abrasador del mediodía en la capital mexicana. La universitaria dice que lo que busca es al menos llamar la atención sobre el conflicto entre sus compañeros y círculo cercano. Confiesa que muchos de sus conocidos de la Facultad de Filosofía y Letras son ajenos a la guerra entre Israel y el grupo islamista Hamás. \"Me gustaría ayudar a crear consciencia aquí en México y en general con todo el mundo, que va más allá de la gente que está protestando en Estados Unidos\", dice. Consignas y reclamos Los estudiantes en el campamento colocaron consignas como \"¡Viva Palestina libre!\" y \"Alto al genocidio en Gaza. Ruptura de relaciones con Israel\". Los manifestantes reclaman además que el gobierno mexicano rompa relaciones diplomáticas y comerciales con Israel y que la propia [UNAM](https://www.debate.com.mx/seccion/cdmx/) detenga cualquier tipo de colaboración con instituciones de ese país. El campamento también es una forma de respaldar a los estudiantes de al menos 30 universidades en Estados Unidos que han sido escenario de manifestaciones en favor de los palestinos en las últimas semanas, algunas reprimidas duramente por fuerzas policiales. Buscamos \"solidarizarnos con las ocupaciones y campamentos estudiantiles tanto en Estados Unidos como en Francia\", dice por su parte, Claudio Escobar, estudiante de Filosofía de 28 años. Escobar también criticó la respuesta del gobierno del estadounidense Joe Biden ante las protestas estudiantiles en ese país. \"Estos gobiernos están dispuestos a todo para acabar con el movimiento estudiantil más importante en Estados Unidos desde el movimiento antiguerra de la guerra de Vietnam\", dijo. En México, las universidades gozan de autonomía y las fuerzas del orden sólo pueden ingresar a las instalaciones bajo mandato de un juez. La última intervención en la UNAM ocurrió en febrero de 2000 cuando policías federales ejecutaron órdenes de captura emitidas contra los líderes de un movimiento estudiantil que mantuvo cerrada la universidad casi diez meses.
