    "title": "White House defends Zelensky's ammunition plant visit, calls Republican investigation 'political stunt'",
    "text": "White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back on calls from top Republicans to investigate President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant, telling reporters on Sept. 26 that it was a \"political stunt\" and that they \"need to drop this.\" Zelensky visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-to-thank-workers/) on Sept. 22, along with Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro and other Democratic politicians from the state, to thank workers for producing critically needed 155 mm shells for Ukraine. Following the visit, Republican Congressman James Comer, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, [announced](https://kyivindependent.com/house-speaker-calls-on-zelensky-to-fire-ambassador-to-us-fox-news-reports/) on Sept. 25 that he was opening up an investigation into the White House's \"misuse of government resources.\" Later in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson, also a Republican, wrote a letter to Zelensky demanding that Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, be fired for alleged \"election interference.\" Johnson argued that Markarova had arranged a taxpayer-funded trip to a battleground state that \"purposely excluded\" Republicans ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Jean-Pierre dismissed the investigation into the visit as a [partisan effort from Republicans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDlacAJH_a0&ab_channel=TheWhiteHouse). She said the Ukrainian delegation had asked to visit the plant, and the Department of Defense (DoD) arranged for their transportation, \"which is common.\" The press secretary added that [Zelensky had visited Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox in July](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-address-us-governors-in-salt-lake-city/) to address the National Governors Association and that \"there was not a single demand for an investigation\" after the trip from Republicans. Zelensky's visit to the ammunition plant was \"business as usual for a Ukrainian request during wartime,\" Jean-Pierre said.",

James Comer (R-KY) said his Oversight Committee is now probing whether the White House knew anything about Hunter Biden’s decision to flaunt a closed-door deposition requested by the panel.\nBoth the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday demanded the White House turn over any recent communication between\nHunter Biden and White House employees, as well as any internal communications surrounding Biden’s Dec. 6 claim that he never interacted with Hunter’s business partners.\nHunter Biden, the president’s son,\ndefied a congressional subpoena earlier this month—offering to testify in a public hearing but not a closed-door session.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later that day said Biden was “certainly familiar with what his son was going to say.”\nThat line alone sent Comer on another fishing expedition to examine “whether the President corruptly sought to influence or obstruct the Committees’ proceeding by preventing, discouraging, or dissuading his son from complying with the Committees’ subpoenas,” according to a letter penned by Comer and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).\n“Such conduct could constitute an impeachable offense,” they added.\nA years-long GOP investigation has\nstruggled to produce evidence linking Biden to any illegal activity. That didn’t stop House Republicans from going all-in, voting to open a formal impeachment inquiry earlier this month.\nThe committee gave the White House a two-week deadline to produce the documents it requested.",

The American Idol finalist and her mother, Patsy Russell , appeared together on an episode of the podcast earlier this month. It was previously recorded live on Music Row in Nashville, Tennessee.\nHost Jennifer Vickery Smith launched the podcast to feature conversations with mothers of entertainers, including about their childhoods and family lives. Vickery Smith said at the top of the episode that “Emmy Rose has some special news to share tonight.”\n“Y’all, me and Tyler are expecting a baby girl,” Emmy announced. Ward briefly joined her on stage and cradled his hands over Emmy's growing baby bump “I’m so excited. Right out of American Idol , I didn’t know. So, you know, that’s kind of been the journey. So I’m so excited. I’m so looking forward to it. …This is the first time I’m actually fully announcing that. I thought it was fitting for this.”\nThroughout the conversation, Emmy and Patsy spoke about their lives with their grandmother and mother, respectively, Loretta Lynn . The beloved country trailblazer “passed away peacefully…in her sleep” the morning of October 4, 2022 at her ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. She was 90. Emmy previously shared how Lynn empowered her to write her own music . She also honored her late grandmother with emotional tributes during her run on American Idol earlier this year.\nFind Got It From My Momma on iHeartRadio here .",

    "text": "Two Nepali international students, 22-year-old Rajan Yadav from Siraha and 20-year-old Rojin Oli from Dang, lost their lives in a car accident on U.S. Highway 80 in Louisiana on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Both students, enrolled at Louisiana Tech University, were traveling in a car driven by Yadav when it veered off the road and crashed into a tree during heavy rainfall around 9 p.m. The collision caused the vehicle to catch fire, leading to the tragic deaths of the two students. Two other students in the car sustained serious injuries and were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. To support the families of Rajan and Rojin, a GoFundMe campaign has been initiated by Rajan’s relative, Patiram Yadav. The funds will cover funeral costs, repatriation of remains if needed, and related ceremonial expenses. The campaign, aiming to raise $50,000, had collected $42,646 at the time of this report. The fundraiser emphasizes that every contribution, no matter how small, will help the grieving families navigate this difficult time. The organizer has expressed gratitude for the community’s support and urged people to contribute to the cause. Those wishing to donate can visit the GoFundMe page. Louisiana Tech University issued a statement expressing profound sorrow over the loss of the two international students, noting that the tragedy has deeply affected the entire university community. The university extended its condolences to the families and loved ones of Rajan and Rojin, acknowledging the weight of this devastating event. To support students during this time, Louisiana Tech has made counseling services available and is planning a memorial event through its Office of International Affairs to honor the memory of the deceased.
