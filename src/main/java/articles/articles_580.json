    "text": "Breaking News\nAll 15 workers rescued after industrial tunnel collapse in Los Angeles\nFifteen workers who were trapped following a collapse in an industrial tunnel in Los Angeles have been rescued safely, according to ABC News.\nThe incident was reported at 7:58 p.m. on Wednesday, and the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) initially said the workers were believed to be isolated up to six miles south of the Wilmington tunnel’s only access point. No injuries have been reported.\nThe collapse occurred near the boundary between Wilmington and Harbor City, close to Los Angeles Harbor College and the 110 Freeway.\nMore than 100 LAFD personnel were deployed to the scene, including Urban Search and Rescue team members specially trained to conduct confined space rescues.\nAuthorities have not disclosed what kind of work was being done in the tunnel or what may have caused the collapse. The incident took place at a tunnel operated by Dragados’ Mining and Boring Company, according to KABC.\nLocal media reported that up to 31 workers were inside the tunnel when the collapse occurred. Fifteen were confirmed to be trapped before being rescued.",

It definitely does help ease you into the team. I've been playing with them the whole way through the academy so to be playing with them now at Anfield is class, it is special.\n:\"I see them every day and know how good they are so just tell them to be themselves. I tell them to play their own game and if they make a mistake, get on the ball again and try to make things happen.\nOn his own development in recent months, he added: \"Yeah I do. Sometimes I am asked to do different things, tonight I was asked to come more inside and play in a double pivot. I just enjoy learning and gaining the experience. I just want to keep making myself better and hope it continues.\" Video of the day:\nAbout ",

    "text": "Jean-Luc Boujon / Photo credits: Ronan Houssin / NurPhoto / NurPhoto via AFP 07:32, December 29, 2023In Privas in the Ardèche, a school trip had to be cancelled for fear of reprisals. A teacher wanted to take his class to the cinema to see Persepolis, a cartoon about the Islamists coming to power in Iran. But with the murder of Dominique Bernard, the teacher preferred to back down. Should teachers censor themselves in France? Last month in Privas, in the Ardèche region, a school trip had to be cancelled for fear of reprisals. The class had to go and see Persepolis, a cartoon by Marjane Satrapiin which a child tells the story of the coming to power in Iran of an Islamic Republic. But a few days before, a teacher in Arras, Dominique Bernard, was murdered by a former student who had become a terrorist. An attack that pushed the Ardèche professor to back down. >> Watch Europe 1 Matin in replay and podcast here Concern about students' reaction Officially, the release was cancelled due to scheduling issues. But in reality, the teacher explained to the director of the local cinema that due to the very tense national context, he did not feel comfortable taking his students to see the film. \"Some of them are Muslims. They might make a bad return to their families. Their questions or reactions could embarrass me or even put me in danger,\" he said. \"We are not immune to a fanatic,\" concluded the teacher, who remembered the tragic chain of events in the Samuel Paty case, and preferred to cancel everything. A wise decision, according to Georges Lafaye de Micheaux, who runs two Catholic high schools in Privas. If the event didn't take place in one of these establishments, if things happened, it shocked him a lot. \"It's a problem for our freedom of expression\" \"It's very sad to be forced to pay attention to what you can say and how you can say them because the elements, taken out of context, can be interpreted in any way,\" he told Europe 1 radio. \"It poses a problem in our freedom of speech and our freedom of thought. But I completely understand that the teacher has backtracked: we walk on eggshells and we don't control each other's interpretations. We also have to be careful not to provoke and to be careful,\" he concludes worriedly. The teacher in question wants to stay in the shadows. Moreover, neither the rectorate nor the prefecture of Ardèche have been informed of anything. Proof of the fears that reign in the national education system on these issues.",

    "text": "[Curtis Moore](https://www.trickybox.com/) ‘95 is an Emmy nominated musician, composer, songwriter, and producer. As one half of the songwriting duo [Mizer & Moore](https://www.mizerandmoore.com/) with Northwestern School of Communication alumnus Thomas Mizer ‘93, Moore wrote five original songs for the third season of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The duo received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for their song \"One Less Angel.\" Recipients of the prestigious Fred Ebb Award for excellence in musical theatre songwriting, Mizer & Moore’s stage credits include commissions from Lincoln Center and the Williamstown Theater Festival. Named a Richard Rodgers Award Finalist, their romantic mystery Triangle premiered at TheatreWorks Silicon Valley to rave reviews and went on to receive six Theatre Bay Area Awards, including “Outstanding World Premiere Musical.” Moore’s credits also include Venice at The Public Theater, Nora Ephron’s Broadway play Lucky Guy starring Tom Hanks, Sam Mendes’ acclaimed world-tour of Richard III, and Todd Solondz’s film Palindromes. What made you choose the Bienen School of Music? I started at NU as an electrical engineering major but switched to music in my sophomore year. I chose Northwestern because I knew that I wanted to go to a school that had a strong music program that existed in harmony with other fields. Which professor(s) influenced you most during your time at the Bienen School of Music? Professor Alan Stout and Professor Amnon Wolman were both such fantastic inspirations and champions of my out-of-the-box writing. Tell us about a particular experience that impacted you during your time at the Bienen School of Music. I always enjoyed practicing in the “ [Beehive](https://maps.northwestern.edu/facility/201),” which I believe is now not used anymore, but it was right next to my dorm, Chapin. I would spend hours there with friends singing and playing songs, and I think this was where I really learned that collaborating was my favorite way to work. What lessons did you learn at Bienen that have continued to resonate with you in your career? Northwestern provided me with many opportunities both in and outside of class to hone the skills that I would use throughout my career. The people I met while working on the many extracurricular projects, performances, and productions are still some of the same people I work with today. We’ve all grown together in our careers, and there is an unofficial Northwestern entertainment group that is still going strong in all facets of the field: TV, film, and theater.

    "text": "Nicaragua: Two more priests arrested By Vatican News Monsignor Carlos Avilés, the vicar general of the Diocese of Managua, and Father Héctor Treminio, the diocesan treasurer, were recently detained by Nicaraguan police. Local sources suggest the arrests came after they had prayed for Bishop Rolando José Álvarez Lagos, the Bishop of Matagalpa and Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Estelí. The Bishop was sentenced to 26 years in prison without a proper trial on charges of conspiracy, spreading false news, obstructing justice, and insulting authorities. Bishop Álvarez has been in jail since February 2023 after being under house arrest since August 2022. With the arrest of Monsignor Avilés and Father Treminio, the total number of priests arrested in Nicaragua in the last week has risen to six. On December 20, Bishop Isidoro del Carmen Mora Ortega, of the Diocese of Siuna, was arrested. According to local media, he too was detained for publicly praying for Bishop Álvarez during a homily. Along with Bishop Mora, two seminarians—Alester Sáenz and Tony Palacio—were also arrested.",

    "text": "Call it the Mike Leach Bowl. Texas Tech and Washington State, two of the programs once led by the late offensive mastermind, are scheduled to meet Saturday in Pullman, Wash., on a day Leach will be inducted into the host Cougars' Hall of Fame. And there should be points aplenty. \"Man, I'm excited to go to Washington State and honor Mike Leach,\" Texas Tech coach Joey Maguire said. \"What better way to do that than have us there.\" Leach is the winningest coach in Texas Tech history and is third on Washington State's list. The visiting Red Raiders (1-0) are coming off a 52-51 overtime victory against Abilene Christian last Saturday, while the Cougars (1-0) routed Portland State that day 70-30. Texas Tech gained 539 yards and Washington State amassed 637. \"I think it's the exact same,\" Cougars coach Jake Dickert said of the two offenses. \"I think they call things the same. They signal things the same ... it's gonna be about execution. I think we're very familiar with it, but at the same time, what makes (Tech's) offense hard is every week is different. You see something one week and you can practice it, and it's completely different in a new formation.\" The Red Raiders' Behren Morton completed 30 of 42 passes for 378 yards -- one shy of his career best -- and a career-high five touchdowns, and Tahj Brooks rushed for 153 yards and a TD. Josh Kelly, who played last season at Washington State, had 10 receptions for 156 yards and one touchdown. Texas Tech, which was a 31 1/2-point favorite in its opener, will have to improve on defense. \"Holy moly ... we have a lot of things we have to fix to get better, and we've got to do 'em in a hurry,\" Maguire said. The Cougars' John Mateer was 11-of-17 passing for 352 yards and five TDs in their opener, with Kyle Williams making four catches for 141 yards and two scores and Kris Hutson adding four grabs for 101 yards and a TD. Wayshawn Parker added 96 yards and a TD on just eight carries for Washington State, which scored 49 points in the first half. Texas Tech and Washington State will be meeting for the third time overall and the first time since 1964, when the Red Raiders beat the Cougars for a second straight year.\nTexas Tech, Washington State to honor Mike Leach, light up scoreboard\n[0](/sports/national_sports/texas-tech-washington-state-to-honor-mike-leach-light-up-scoreboard/article_df064fe5-1171-584e-be03-405fea274b26.html#comments)\n ",
