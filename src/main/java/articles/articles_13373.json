    "text": "Nadir Aslam, a German of Moroccan-Pakistani heritage, had been planning to vote Green in this week's elections to the European Parliament. Instead, he will throw his support behind Mera25, a start-up leftist party with a clear pro-Palestinian stance.\nAslam, 33, told Reuters it was a speech last November by a Green leader doubling down on German support for Israel, even as the Gaza death toll neared 9,000, which \"destroyed\" his support for the ecologist party, a member of Germany's ruling coalition.\nThis shift in support, echoed across Europe, represents the latest threat - this time from the left - to mainstream political parties whose project to deepen European integration is already under attack from the far-right.\nThe trend is not only among the EU's Muslim communities but also among left-leaning voters who see a double standard in Europe's condemnation of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel but failure to call out Israel for its military assault on Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\"We have a rise in radical right and radical left parties, (which will) reshape the policy landscape in Europe, the balance of power of several parties,\" said Samira Azabar, a sociologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands.\nThis could have consequences for the bloc's position on Israel and also drive policies granting more decision-making power at a national level, she said. EU members Spain and Ireland have recognized a Palestinian state, as has Slovenia's government, pending parliamentary approval.\nWhile the popularity of the far-right has been rising in recent years, surveys show minorities have been voting more for the radical left as mainstream parties drift rightwards on issues such a migration and cultural values.\nPolling last month by Ipsos showed the far-right set to make the biggest gains in the June 6-9 elections, with the Left group in the EU assembly gaining six more seats - both at the expense of the Social Democrat, Green and Renew Europe blocs.\nIn France, far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) has centered its campaign on a pro-Palestinian stance in a bid to win Muslim and radical-left voters, said Blandine Chelini-Pont, a historian at Aix-Marseille University.\nIt seeks an arms embargo, sanctions on Israel, recognition of a Palestinian state and - in contrast to other left-wing groups - refrains from calling Hamas a terrorist group. Among Muslim voters in France it polls at 44% support compared to its 8% share of the electorate as a whole.\n\"Some will say we are surfing on an electorate but who are we speaking about? These are citizens of this country who do not have a racist vision of society,\" LFI lawmaker Sebastien Delogu told Reuters.\nFrance's Socialists also seek recognition of a Palestinian state but do not share LFI's stance on Hamas.\n\"LFI has a relationship with violence that is not okay,\" lead Socialist candidate Raphael Glucksmann told Reuters, who says his rise in the polls to third place at 14% is in part due to his choice to distance himself from LFI.\nIn Germany, pro-Palestinian startup parties are eroding support for the German Greens and Social Democrats, two of the mainstream parties which have maintained a staunch support for Israel due to Germany's historical responsibility for the Holocaust.\nAside from leftist Mera25, other pro-Palestinian start-ups include socially conservative groups like DAVA and BIG and the eurosceptic party BSW - which wants an arms embargo on Israel while pushing anti-immigration policies.\nSupporters of BSW, which is polling at 7%, are 50% more likely to recognise a Palestinian state than the overall German electorate.\nIn Spain, where tensions with Israel date back to the Franco dictatorship, government recognition of a Palestinian state is shoring up support for parties in the ruling coalition, the Socialist Party (PSOE) and far-left Sumar.\n\"The Palestinian issue has become central to the political debate in Spain,\" said David Hernandez, professor of International Relations at the Complutense University of Madrid.\nVoter turnout could be key.\nRadboud University's Azabar noted that turnout was often lower among ethnic minorities than for the general population in EU elections, but the Gaza war may be a motivation this time.\nForeign policy issues have a track record of impacting the ethnic minority vote. In 2016, Germany's Social Democrats lost some 100,000 Turkish voters after recognizing the Armenian genocide of the First World War, said Teyfik Özcan, chairman of DAVA, a new party targeting Turkish diaspora voters.\nÖzcan, a former SPD member, said his party offered the option of a protest vote that didn't exist until now.\n\"Germans have the opportunity to say, 'Okay, I'm voting for the (far-right) AfD in protest.' Muslims cannot do that,\" he told Reuters.\nA December survey by the Institute of Political Science at the University of Duisberg-Essen showed that one in three German Muslims did not feel represented by any party.\nA new sense of political representation resonates for French voters too. LFI has named as a candidate French-Palestinian lawyer Rima Hassan, who is present at protests, active on social media and is petitioning the EU to suspend its association agreement with Israel.\nChama Tahiri Ivorra, a 34-year old French-Moroccan chef, said she had never voted in a European election but would this time.\n\"Voting for Rima is an act of resistance,\" she said. \"I don't know all the points on LFI's program but what she and their other members say about Palestine is just.\"",

    "title": "Does ArcGIS Pro use Python?",
    "text": "Does ArcGIS Pro use Python?\nYes, ArcGIS Pro uses Python as its scripting language.\nIs Python installed with ArcGIS Pro?\nYes, ArcGIS Pro includes a default, read-only conda-based Python. This Python is used within ArcGIS Pro and can also be used to run stand-alone scripts. The default conda environment, arcgispro-py3, includes all Python libraries used by ArcGIS Pro.\nWhat database does ArcGIS Pro use?\nArcGIS Pro can use various databases, including IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SAP HANA, and more. It supports both file geodatabases and enterprise geodatabases.\nIs Python good for GIS?\nYes, Python is widely used in GIS for tasks such as data analysis, data visualization, spatial analysis, and automation. It has a wide range of libraries and modules specifically designed for GIS operations.\nDoes ArcGIS Pro come with Anaconda?\nArcGIS Pro includes an installation of Miniconda, a smaller version of Anaconda that includes conda, Python, and the packages they depend on. It also includes a select set of useful packages.\nWhat language does ArcGIS Pro use?\nArcGIS Pro uses Python as its scripting language. Python 3 is used in ArcGIS Pro, while other ArcGIS products use Python 2. The arcpy.mapping module in other ArcGIS products is replaced by the arcpy.mp module in ArcGIS Pro.\nWhat programming language does ArcGIS Pro use?\nArcGIS Pro uses Python as its programming language. It specifically uses the ArcPy site-package within Python to access and perform geoprocessing functionality in ArcGIS.\nDo I need to know Python for ArcGIS?\nWhile it’s not necessary to know Python for basic GIS tasks in ArcGIS Pro, learning Python can greatly enhance your capabilities and productivity in ArcGIS. Python and the ArcPy library provide a powerful toolset for automating workflows, conducting advanced analysis, and developing custom tools.\nIs Python or R better for GIS?\nBoth Python and R have their strengths in GIS. Python offers better integration with popular GIS software and tools like ArcGIS and QGIS, making it a preferred choice for geospatial data processing. R, on the other hand, has more robust statistical capabilities and is often favored for data analysis and visualization.\nDoes ArcGIS run on Python?\nYes, ArcGIS utilizes Python for scripting and automation purposes. You can directly run Python code in ArcGIS using the Python window, which allows you to access and execute geoprocessing tools, manipulate data, and perform various spatial analyses.\nWhich is better ArcGIS or ArcGIS Pro?\nArcGIS Pro is the next-generation GIS software from Esri, focusing on 2D and 3D mapping, visualization, analysis, and editing.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Google's Gemini AI chatbot and assistant Google rolls out Gemini AI chatbot and assistant 03:50 A grad student in Michigan received a threatening response during a chat with Google's AI chatbot Gemini.\nIn a back-and-forth conversation about the challenges and solutions for aging adults, Google's Gemini responded with this threatening message:\n\"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"\nThe 29-year-old grad student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who told CBS News they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"\nScreenshot of Google Gemini chatbot's response in an online exchange with a grad student. CBS News \"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" Reddy said.\n\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.\nGoogle states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.\nIn a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"\nWhile Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.\nIt's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.\nGoogle said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.\nHowever, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs. The mother of a 14-year-old Florida teen, who died by suicide in February, filed a lawsuit against another AI company, Character.AI, as well as Google, claiming the chatbot encouraged her son to take his life.\nOpenAI's ChatGPT has also been known to output errors or confabulations known as \"hallucinations.\" Experts have highlighted the potential harms of errors in AI systems, from spreading misinformation and propaganda to rewriting history.",

In a statement released via the official page of the Office of the Fourth President of Kenya, Kenyatta urged President Tshisekedi to prioritize peace and foster unity within the DRC. “Former President Uhuru Kenyatta extends his warm congratulations to H.E. President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on his well-deserved re-election as the President of the DRC,” the statement on his official page states. He also stressed the significance of peace and unity, stating, “Peace and unity serve as the fundamental pillars of a prosperous nation.” During the elections held on December 20, 2023, President Tshisekedi secured an impressive 72% of the votes. Although some members of the DRC’s opposition are calling for a rerun of the elections due to reported “numerous irregularities” highlighted by the main observer mission, President Tshisekedi’s victory remains officially recognized. There has been post-election violence in the DRC since last week but there is no immediate confirmation of casualty figures.",

    "text": "Un descubrimiento sin respuestas: el hallazgo arqueológico sin sentido que la ciencia no puede confirmar\nEl debate sobre este particular artefacto lleva décadas generando más preguntas que certezas. ¿Es símbolo de una civilización antigua o prueba de la existencia de los aliens?\nEn la historia de los hallazgos arqueológicos, algunos despiertan más preguntas que respuestas. Este descubrimiento es un artefacto que ha generado[ fascinación, teorías conspirativas y debates](http://cronista.com/colombia/curiosidades/el-fin-del-mundo-esta-mas-cerca-de-lo-que-pensabas-esta-mente-brillante-le-puso-fecha-al-apocalipsis/) que van desde civilizaciones avanzadas hasta la existencia de aliens.\nSe trata de un hallazgo que ha alimentado la imaginación y planteado preguntas sobre nuestra especie durante décadas. Un símbolo de los enigmas históricos y una curiosidad que invita a seguir explorando nuestro mundo.\n[Este gigantesco misterio del universo ha sido resuelto: ¿Cuál es la respuesta definitiva de la ciencia?](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1326199&s=96a10cf5b77c8107ec1be61b5ae6b039)\nEste descubrimiento arqueológico dejó sin respuestas a los científicos\nEn 1936, en las cercanías de Londres, Texas, Estados Unidos, Max y Emma Hahn realizaron un descubrimiento arqueológico inusual: un martillo incrustado en una roca. El hallazgo del \"Martillo de Londres\" pronto se convirtió en un enigma cuando estudios iniciales sugirieron que la roca que lo rodeaba podría tener 400 millones de años, una era en la que, según la paleontología, aún no existían humanos.\nEl martillo tenía un mango de madera parcialmente fosilizado y una cabeza de hierro de 96.6% de pureza. Esta es una aleación pocas veces vista en herramientas de esa época y, por lo tanto, el objeto fue catalogado como un \"artefacto fuera de lugar\" (OOPArt), un término usado para describir objetos que no encajan con su contexto histórico.\nDebate por el origen del Martillo de Londres: ¿Fueron extraterrestres?\nLas teorías sobre el origen del martillo abarcan desde ideas extraordinarias hasta planteamientos científicos: algunos lo consideran una prueba de que seres extraterrestres visitaron la Tierra. Para otros podría ser evidencia de civilizaciones avanzadas prehistóricas, incluso relacionadas con un mundo anterior al diluvio bíblico, como afirman los creacionistas como Carl Baugh, quien adquirió el martillo en 1983.\nAun así, los científicos creen tener una explicación práctica: el martillo sería una herramienta de mineros del siglo XIX que quedó atrapada en una concreción mineral, un proceso natural que pudo darle la apariencia de gran antigüedad. A falta de análisis concluyentes, los expertos se mantienen escépticos mientras muchos aun creen en un origen bíblico o extraterrestre.\nLas más leídas de Curiosidades\n[Debate en internet](/colombia/curiosidades/extraterrestres-egipto-avion-experiencia-ciencia-ficcion/)\n¿Extraterrestres en pleno vuelo?

    "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nAs the South reels from a deadly spate of storms, the community of Christina, Tennessee, holds its breath for a 10-year-old boy who &a;ldquo; needs a miracle &a;rdquo; to survive.\n&a;#8203;Asher Sullivan was swept into a storm drain while playing in a flooded street. He later emerged in a ditch, badly hurt, and was rushed to the hospital. On Thursday, more than 500 people gathered for a prayer vigil honoring Asher and his father, Rutherford County Schools Director Dr. Jimmy Sullivan.\nThe severe weather outbreak claimed at least four lives and left a mark of destruction across several states. On Thursday, amidst clean up efforts from earlier storms, a potent line of thunderstorms barrelled through the central U.S. affecting millions. The National Weather Service had warned of an enhanced risk for severe weather spanning from Texas to South Carolina.\nAt Least Four People Killed By Severe Storms In South In Claiborne County, Tennessee, a 22-year-old man died when a tree, knocked down by high winds, crushed the car he was in. Claiborne County Mayor Joseph Brooks said the victim, identified as Bryce Edward Hentnick, was killed in the Lone Mountain area.\nSouth of Nashville, in Maury County, Tennessee, a severe thunderstorm produced a tornado that has preliminarily been rated EF3. A spokesperson for Maury Regional Health said five people were admitted to the hospital. Unfortunately, one of those people succumbed to their injuries.
