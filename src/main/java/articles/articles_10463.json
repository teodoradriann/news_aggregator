    "text": "Apple TV+ has dropped a new Masters of the Air video for the upcoming historical drama, which chronicles the bravery and struggles of a group of Air Force soldiers during World War II. The featurette provides a preview of the show’s epic scale and scope. It features commentary from the main cast and creative team, including executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg , as they discussed what is the show about. This marks Hanks and Austin Butler’s latest collaboration following 2022’s Elvis. The series will start streaming January 26. Check out the Masters of the Air video below ( watch more trailers ): “It follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the ‘Bloody Hundredth’) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air,” reveals the synopsis. “Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich is at the heart of Masters of the Air. Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all. Ranging in location from the bucolic fields and villages of southeast England, to the harsh deprivations of a German prisoner-of-war camp, and depicting a unique and crucial time in world history, Masters of the Air is enormous in both scale and scope, and a genuine cinematic achievement.” Based on Donald L. Miller’s 2007 book of the same name, Masters of the Air depicts the heroic actions of the men of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. The ensemble cast includes Austin Butler as Major Gale Cleven, Barry Keoghan as Lt. Curtis Biddick, Callum Turner as Major John Egan, Anthony Boyle as Major Harry Crosby, Nate Mann as Major Robert Rosenthal, Raff Law as Sgt. Ken Lemmons, and more. The series is executive produced and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga from a screenplay adapted by John Orloff, who is also producing. Executive producers are Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman, Grahan Yost, Steven Spielberg, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, and Steven Shareshian, with Dee Rees, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck serving as directors.

    "text": "In this week’s The Safe Side, we explore the rise of deepfake technology, its dangers, and the avenues available to victims to protect themselves against the violation of their privacy. Written by Ankita Deshkar Nagpur | Updated: January 10, 2025 15:02 IST 8 min read The growing threat of deepfake pornography. (Image: Abhishek Mitra/The Indian Express) The misuse of artificial intelligence continues to challenge ethical and legal boundaries, with one of its most alarming manifestations being deepfake pornography. To counter this growing threat, the US Senate recently passed the bipartisan ‘Take It Down’ Act, which criminalises the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery, including AI-generated deepfake content. The Bill, which mandates social media platforms and websites to remove such content within 48 hours of notification from victims, now moves to the House for consideration.\nIt is important to understand the technology behind deepfake pornography, its rise, dangers, how individuals can protect themselves, and what to do if photos or videos are being misused.\nTo get insights about the issue, we spoke with Abhivardhan, chairperson and managing trustee, Indian Society of Artificial Intelligence and Law, and Lohit Matani, Nagpur’s deputy commissioner of police (cyber).\nAdvertisement The growing threat of deepfake pornography In 2024, deepfakes took centre stage in India following morphed images of Bollywood celebrities Rashmika Mandanna, Alia Bhatt , and Katrina Kaif spread like wildfire on social media. However, deepfakes are not limited to celebrities, the technology has been used increasingly to target regular people, making deepfake pornography a widespread concern.\nAccording to social media analytics firm Twicsy, 84 per cent of social media influencers have fallen victim to deepfake pornography. What began with hyper-realistic AI-generated celebrity images has now transitioned into scams and blackmail targeting ordinary people.\nAlso Read | Love, lies, and loss: How scammers on dating apps lure lonely hearts Take the case of Sanket (name changed). Early last year, he clicked on a seemingly harmless advertisement on a social media platform. What followed was a nightmare—scammers with access to his public pictures began blackmailing him with deepfake intimate images, threatening to distribute them unless he paid up.\n(Illustration: Abhishek Mitra/The Indian Express) Sanket initially ignored the threats, turning off his phone to avoid incessant WhatsApp calls. But the harassment escalated when fake Facebook profiles began sharing doctored images of him in the comments section of his posts. He deleted his Facebook profile and changed his number. Fearing judgment and distrust from law enforcement, Sanket chose not to report the incident to the cybercrime cell. “They would have found faults in my social media usage, would have judged me for clicking on an inappropriate advertisement, and I believe nothing would have changed,” he told indianexpress.com .\nAdvertisement With better awareness, Sanket could have averted the emotional and social toll of such a traumatic experience.\nHow are deepfakes made? Creating deepfake pornography has become alarmingly easy, with more than a hundred “nudify” websites, software and applications available online. These tools allow even users with minimal technical skills to create deepfakes. A simple search will lead users to these websites.\nWhile “rules” on such websites say only those above 18 years of age are allowed, there is no proof or verification required, much like on porn sites, and even though such websites warn users not to use others’ images without their permission, it is obvious users are not going to use the tool to create their own pornographic images.\nAccording to Abhivardhan, cases of deepfakes in India have grown at an alarming pace—not just in political campaigns but also in non-political contexts. “According to a report, deepfake online content increased by 900 per cent between 2019 and 2020 globally, and some researchers predict that up to 90 per cent of online content could be made synthetically by 2026. More recent analysis shows that Indian social media users are frequently exposed to AI-altered media,” he said.\nAdvertisement (Illustration: Abhishek Mitra/ The Indian Express ) Modern AI deepfakes are powered by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which uses two machine-learning models: a “generator” to create synthetic media and a “discriminator” to detect if it’s fake. Through repeated attempts, the generator refines its output until the visual or audio content is convincingly realistic. The continuous feedback loop between the generator and discriminator polishes the output until it is often indistinguishable from genuine footage, rendering it highly deceptive making these deepfakes very convincing. Advanced AI can capture minute details—facial expressions, lighting nuances, voice tones, and more.\nIndia’s legal framework for deepfakes “At present, India lacks a comprehensive legal framework specifically tailored to AI-generated content or deepfakes. AI platforms generally operate in a grey area—so long as they adhere to India’s Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and avoid hosting or distributing explicit illegal content, they may remain technically within legal limits. However, the law is still evolving,” Abhivardhan said.\nWhile the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 includes provisions for defamation, fraud, identity theft, deepfakes or non-consensual AI-generated images and videos are not explicitly addressed. Same is the case with the IT Act, 2000.\nRecent advisories from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have faced criticism for being vague and non-binding. Civil remedies under privacy and defamation laws also remain limited in scope.\nWhat should victims do? Preserve evidence: Capture screenshots, note URLs and timestamps of the manipulated content.\nAdvertisement Report to authorities: Capture screenshots, note URLs and timestamps of the manipulated content. File a complaint with the cybercrime cell via the Ministry of Home Affairs portal or local police station. Sections 66E (image privacy) of the IT Act or provisions of the BNS can be invoked.\nRequest platform takedowns: Most social media platforms have policies against non-consensual intimate images or manipulated content. Victims can file a takedown request with evidence.\nSeek legal help: A legal notice or cease-and-desist letter might be needed if the perpetrator or platform is unresponsive.\nNGOs and legal aid programmes: While India does not have a specific deepfake support organisation, certain digital rights groups, cyber law clinics, and pro bono legal initiatives may help navigate the process.\nAdvertisement Also Read | You are one click away from losing everything: The real danger of KYC scams According to Matani, “The primary motive when a victim files a complaint regarding morphed intimate images is to take down the image from the platform where it has been uploaded or shared. The steps are to identify the account, deleting the media and identifying and nabbing the accused.”\nIn cases involving sharing of such manipulated data on WhatsApp, “it becomes important to delete the images from the devices of the people”, said Matani. “If the pictures are shared on WhatsApp groups, the admins are treated as accused in the case.\nThe accused are booked under the combination of sections from Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023. In cases of child pornography, the accused are booked under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO),” he said.\nPreventive measures Abhivardhan listed some preventive measures for social media users:\nAdvertisement 📌Restrict privacy settings: Limit who can view or download your content.\n📌Avoid sharing sensitive data: Remove geotags, personal identifiers, or any data that can be used to create convincing forgeries.\n📌Two-factor authentication: Enable it to reduce account hacking risks.\n📌Use watermarking: Subtle watermarking of personal images can deter misuse. This may not be foolproof, it adds a barrier.\n📌Be vigilant: Regularly review tagged photos or unknown friend requests to catch unauthorised usage\nAdvertisement The way forward Deepfake technology poses unique challenges to privacy and security. Beyond its misuse in pornography, it enables sophisticated fraud, such as voice cloning for identity theft.\nAbhivardhan underscores the shared responsibility of governments, tech platforms, and citizens to address this issue. While AI-driven innovations hold promise, their misuse must be curtailed to protect personal rights and maintain public trust in digital spaces.\nDiscover the Benefits of Our Subscription!

    "title": "Gaza: New Israeli orders force thousands in Deir al-Balah to flee again, and disrupt last aid hub",
    "text": "RAMALLAH, August 22, 2024 – New displacement orders issued by Israeli authorities have forced another mass movement of families and humanitarian workers from areas in Deir al-Balah – one of the only remaining areas in the occupied Gaza Strip with essential infrastructure and warehouses storing aid supplies.\nMany Palestinian families, already forcibly displaced countless times since October, are on the move yet again, including humanitarian workers critical to providing the limited aid response that is still possible.\nAt least 24 NGOs have reported impacts from orders in the past week resulting in the forced displacement of staff members, operations disrupted, and at least one site sheltering civilians under attack. Warehouses storing supplies are located within the blocks that have come under orders that are resulting in forcible displacement.\nSo-called ‘“evacuation” orders issued by Israeli authorities on 13, 15, 16 and 21 August continue to obstruct aid operations, affecting a number of agencies including Save the Children, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), MSF, Solidarités International, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Oxfam, Humanity & Inclusion, Action Against Hunger, Islamic Relief, Project HOPE, DanChurchAid and Norwegian Church Aid and partners, and Palestinian partners of ActionAid, War Child, Danish Refugee Council, Médicos del Mundo, Middle East Children’s Alliance and WeWorld.\nA shelter belonging to ANERA has come under fire, while NRC has waited more than 15 days for the Israeli authorities to respond to a request to deconflict an area where they seek to relocate staff following Israel’s latest displacement order.\nThe UN said that multiple orders issued by Israeli forces in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah between 8 and 17 August impacted 17 health facilities, including five primary healthcare centres and nine medical points, disrupting essential health services. Disruptions will also threaten the ability to administer critically needed polio vaccines once they arrive in Gaza.\nCommunities are cut off from vital aid, as suppliers who deliver essential items like water, face challenges reaching locations close to the areas which people have been ordered to leave.\nHumanitarian actors must be allowed to deliver aid based on need rather than the designation of safe areas by a party to the conflict.\n“Even if Israeli authorities let polio vaccines in, with the biggest responders in Gaza constantly pin-balled from one place to the next, how can we deliver an effective campaign and reach the children in dire need of that protection? If you want to understand the access situation, this is it – not the trickle of trucks exceptionally allowed to enter.” said Jeremy Stoner, Save the Children Regional Director for the Middle East.\n“Palestinians in Gaza have been relentlessly uprooted, forced from one so-called ‘safe’ area to the next, enduring unimaginable hardship and loss. Among them are brave humanitarian workers who risk their lives every day to save others. Our ability to provide meaningful aid in any part of Gaza does not meet our ambitions, l let alone the overwhelming needs. Deir al-Balah, once declared a humanitarian zone, is now under attack with bombardment at our doorstep,” said Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n“We are a humanitarian organisation, trying to deliver humanitarian services in what Israel had unilaterally declared a ‘humanitarian zone’. These conditions don’t just punish us, they impact civilians assistance,” said Suze van Meegen, NRC’s acting Country Director in Palestine.\n“The situation has become incredibly dangerous. There’s constant fighting, and the sounds of shelling and explosions are clearly audible. Skin diseases are spreading rapidly. We’re all becoming paranoid that we’ll get infected. The physical toll is real. I’ve been having severe stomach pains, likely from the contaminated water we’re forced to drink. I don’t know how much longer we can survive like this,” said Lena*, Mercy Corps staff member in Gaza.\nFor more than 10 months, humanitarian organisations have called for an immediate and sustained ceasefire. Now the looming risk of a polio outbreak and urgent need to vaccinate children in Gaza makes this more urgent than ever.\nAll parties to conflict have an obligation to facilitate humanitarian access at all times. Israel as the occupying power is obligated to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the occupied population are met.

    "text": "[Fútbol](/deportes/futbol) El minuto que cambió (momentáneamente) la suerte de Barça y Atlético: Lamine y Griezmann, al rescate Ambos equipos iban perdiendo hasta el minuto 28 de partido FC Barcelona y Atlético de Madrid debutaban este jueves en el nuevo formato de Champions League. Los blaugranas visitaban Mónaco y los rojiblancos recibían al Leipzig. Ninguno de los dos conjuntos arrancó su andadura en Europa de la mejor manera posible. En el Metropolitano, el Atlético sufrió el buen arranque de partido de los alemanes a los cuatro minutos de encuentro. Sesko abrió a banda hacia Nusa, que finalizó en el área y Oblak le contestó con un paradón, pero el balón rechazado en el área lo cazó de cabeza el propio Sesko para cabecear a gol y poner por delante en el electrónico al Leipzig. El comienzo del Barça fue peor. Los arranques en Liga de los de Flick estaban siendo arrolladores, dominando desde el comienzo y creando peligro con mucha facilidad, pero ante el conjunto francés fue todo lo contrario. En el minuto 10 de partido, Ter Stegen falló en la salida de balón, cediendo mal el balón y regalándoselo a un rival. Ante ello, Eric García empujó a Minamino justo al borde del área para evitar el mano a mano, por lo que acabó viendo la tarjeta y dejando al Barça con diez jugadores. Pocos minutos después, una gran acción individual de Akliouche servía a los locales para adelantarse en esta cita europea. El minuto de oro para el fútbol español El minuto 28 de encuentro fue un punto de inflexión para ambos conjuntos españoles en sus respectivos enfrentamientos. Balón largo que gana Lamine Yamal a la carrera, lanza la diagonal hacia dentro, finalizando con un disparo ajustadito al palo corto, superando a Kohn y haciendo su primer gol en Champions. En ese mismo minuto, pero en el Metropolitano, Griezmann también firmó las tablas para los suyos. Apertura a Llorente, que centra al corazón del área, y el '7' del Atlético finaliza de volea sin dejarla caer con la diestra para lograr el 1-1 en el marcador.

    "text": "YouTube , Google’s popular video sharing service, has quietly undergone a major overhaul.\nYes, now if you open YouTube without signing in to Google account, the home page will be completely blank .\nPreviously, if you opened YouTube even without logging in to an account, there were a number of videos that were recommended based on the user’s local history.\nHowever, now if you log out of the web browser, or open YouTube on a browser without Google account login or use incognito mode, a blank page will appear when opening the video sharing website.\nA message will be written on this blank page asking the user to search for videos.\nIt is unclear when YouTube made the change, as it was not announced by the company.\nHowever, such a change was hinted at in August 2023, under which users were to be given the option to keep the YouTube homepage blank.\nAt the time it was mentioned that you had to clear your YouTube watch history to blank the homepage.\nOn the occasion, YouTube added that several features are connected to Watch History, including a home feed, and this new change will be better for users who prefer to search for content themselves instead of recommendations.\nBut then this change was not implemented as it was heavily criticized by users.\nNow this new change has been made which is somewhat good or bad for the users is not yet clear.\n#Big #change #YouTube #quietly #users #surprised\nWhat are the potential impacts ⁤of YouTube’s blank homepage on user engagement and content discovery? **Interview with Sarah Jenkins,​ Digital Media Analyst**\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for joining us today, Sarah. YouTube has recently undergone a significant change, where the homepage appears⁣ blank to⁤ users who are not signed in. What do you think prompted ‍this decision?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** Thanks for having me! It seems that YouTube is trying to encourage users to interact more directly with the platform ​by searching for content themselves, rather than relying on ⁤recommended videos. This shift could⁤ be seen as a move towards fostering a‍ more personalized experience for those who prefer to curate their own content.\n**Interviewer:** That makes sense, but many users relied on those recommendations. How⁤ do you ⁢think this will​ affect user engagement on the platform?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** That’s ‌a crucial point. For some users, the⁤ absence ‍of a personalized feed might lead to frustration ⁢or a decline in usage, especially if‌ they were accustomed to discovering new content through recommendations. However, it could also attract users who are overwhelmed by recommendations⁣ and prefer to take control of their ⁣viewing experience. ‍It’s likely that we’ll ⁢see varied reactions ‍depending on individual user preferences.\n**Interviewer:** You‌ mentioned varied ​reactions. There has been criticism of this change in the past.⁤ Could user backlash really impact YouTube’s decision-making?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** Absolutely! ⁤User feedback is⁤ vital in⁤ shaping platform policies. YouTube had previously hinted at implementing a ​blank homepage and faced backlash, which may have delayed such ‌changes. If users rally against this current decision, YouTube might reconsider its approach, especially if‍ it ‍reflects negatively on user engagement metrics. Ultimately, they want to‍ keep their audience happy ⁢and⁢ active.\n**Interviewer:** With this change implemented without a formal announcement, do you think transparency is an issue for YouTube?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** Definitely.⁢ Clear communication about significant changes is essential for retaining trust and maintaining‌ a ‍positive relationship with users. Users ‌appreciate being informed ahead of time ‍about adjustments that directly affect their experience.‍ A lack of transparency ⁤can lead to confusion and dissatisfaction, which isn’t ⁤beneficial for any‌ platform.\n**Interviewer:** Now that this change is live, what advice would⁤ you give to users navigating this new experience?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** I would encourage users to embrace the search⁢ functionality and explore channels that⁣ align with their interests. While the blank homepage might be disorienting at first, it can also​ be an opportunity to discover⁤ content more intentionally. Additionally, providing feedback directly to YouTube can help them adjust their services to better meet user needs.\n**Interviewer:** Lastly, how do you⁤ predict users will respond in the ‍coming months? Will they adapt, or is there ⁢potential for greater pushback?\n**Sarah Jenkins:** It’s a mixed bag. Some users will adapt and may even appreciate the change, while others might react negatively, leading to vocal complaints across social media. It will be interesting to‌ observe how ​YouTube engages with ‍this feedback moving forward. Ultimately, the success‌ of this overhaul depends on how‍ well they balance user preferences with their⁤ strategic goals.\n**Interviewer:** Thank you, Sarah, for your insights on this significant update ‍from YouTube.\nAs a final thought for ‌our readers, what do ⁤you think ‍about YouTube’s⁣ decision to implement a blank homepage when not signed in? Is this a step towards a better user experience, or have they taken a step too far?‌ We’d love to hear your thoughts!",

    "text": "The chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, N Chandrababu Naidu and Revanth Reddy, have been sagacious in holding talks to end the disputes that have plagued the two states for the last 10 years. Ironically, a state formed on the basis of language had to be bifurcated under the Andhra Pradesh State Reorganisation Act, 2014. Division always creates problems, and these problems have remained unresolved for a decade. Though Naidu heads the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre, and Reddy is a Congress leader, they have joined hands to address their differences at their first meeting in Hyderabad on June 6. Their meeting succeeded in creating a framework for dispute resolution. There will now be two committees: the first comprising the chief secretaries of the two states, and the second comprising the ministers concerned. If these two committees are unable to resolve an issue, it will be brought before the two chief ministers.\nAt the very first meeting, an agreement was reached to merge into Telangana five border villages currently with Andhra Pradesh, a task that can be accomplished only if the Centre promulgates an ordinance. There are areas in Telangana to which Andhra Pradesh has staked a claim for administrative and other reasons. Not all issues are easy to resolve. For instance, Telangana has been claiming Rs 24,000 crore as its share from the power assets held by Andhra Pradesh. Water sharing is another intractable issue that calls for deft handling by both states. Of course, this is not the first time that states have been bifurcated.\nWhen Uttarakhand and Jharkhand were formed, and before that, when Assam was divided several times, similar disputes cropped up and they were amicably resolved. One must not forget that while there are numerous water-sharing disputes between states, often court-appointed tribunals have found workable solutions. What this underscores is that there is no problem that cannot be resolved if approached with an open mind. Today, arbitration is a well-structured branch of law which students are keen to pursue because of the immense opportunities it provides. The principles of arbitration are the same for all disputes, which need to be settled with the least inconvenience to the parties concerned.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 11 July 2024, 21:49 IST",

    "text": "MoneyDJ新聞 2025-07-31 11:40:36 記者 張以忠 報導美國雲端服務巨擘微軟公布財報，營運數字優於市場預期。其中，微軟預期新會計年度的資本支出會持續成長，受惠微軟資本支出展望正向，相關AI伺服器ODM供應鏈如廣達（2382）、鴻海（2317）、緯創(3231)/緯穎（6669）等有望同步受惠。 微軟財務長Amy Hood於近日法說會上表示，預期2025會計年度首季（即 7-9月）資本支出及透過融資租賃取得的資產總額將超過300億美元，年增率逾50%，遠高於市場先前共識的242.3億美元。並進一步預告，2026會計年度（自今年7月起）全年資本支出將持續成長。若各季度支出保持均值，全年總額將突破1,200億美元，年增率達36%，亦高於市場預期的1,005億美元。 微軟資本支出展望強勁，反映雲端及AI伺服器建置需求持續擴大，將帶動供應鏈同步受惠，包括鴻海、緯穎、廣達等ODM大廠後續動能看俏。 緯穎受惠於AI伺服器需求大幅成長，法人預估2025年營收將年增一倍以上，EPS有望上看180元，較去年明顯提升。現階段以ASIC伺服器出貨為主，未來隨著GPU伺服器貢獻增溫，營運可望續揚。特別是輝達新一代GB200伺服器預計自下半年起開始貢獻營收，馬來西亞YTL集團與美系雲端客戶訂單將接續挹注，推升營收動能。 廣達方面，隨著GB200伺服器量產出貨進入高峰期，第二季AI伺服器營收占比進一步提升。法人預期第三季下旬GB300伺服器將開始樣品出貨，因與GB200架構相近，生產進度將順利銜接，有助整體出貨放量。公司維持全年AI伺服器營收三位數成長目標不變，並強調全年AI伺服器占整體伺服器比重有望突破七成。 法人亦看好鴻海AI伺服器業務動能，預估2025年第三季GB200與GB300機櫃出貨將較前一季倍數成長，顯著帶動雲端業務營收增長。隨著鴻海在AI機櫃製造與整合能力逐步強化，營收與獲利表現可望自今年延續至明年。 除了微軟外，近期包括Alphabet、Meta亦上調2025年資本支出，主因同樣為擴建資料中心與AI基礎設施。隨著CSP（雲端服務提供商）巨型企業紛紛上修資本支出計畫，有利於AI伺服器與資料中心建置持續擴大，將進一步帶動ODM廠商營運動能。 (圖:資料庫)",
