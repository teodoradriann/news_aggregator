    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | East London and West Essex Guardian Series",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

    "text": "Mother who is accused of killing her baby makes court appearance\nBy Matt Wreden\nClick here for updates on this story\nBUTTE COUNTY, California (\nKHSL) — A Chico woman appeared in Butte County Superior Court on June 6 regarding the fentanyl overdose death of her baby boy.\nChristy Ann Scarbrough, 40, was charged by the Butte County District Attorney’s Office special victims’ unit for felony child abuse with a special allegation that the abuse resulted in the infant’s death.\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Scarbrough found the boy face down in his crib on the evening of July 6, 2023, the boy’s first birthday. The child was blue and unresponsive. She took him to Enloe Hospital, where he was ultimately pronounced dead, Ramsey said.\nAn investigation by Chico police revealed there was a straw in the baby’s crib that tested positive for fentanyl. An extensive investigation was followed by the police and district attorney’s office, including an autopsy that showed an extraordinarily high amount of fentanyl in the infant’s gastric acid, indicating the baby ingested the fentanyl.\nRamsey said Scarbrough is an admitted fentanyl user. The use of a straw is a common method of adult ingestion of fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n“We have overdoses and here’s a child that obviously got into its mother’s stash of fentanyl and expired because of that,” Ramsey said.\nScarbrough was previously convicted of child abuse in 2013 and sentenced to prison when her then seven-week-old daughter tested positive for methamphetamine. Ramsey said it was alleged that Scarbrough was taking methamphetamine and other drugs while breastfeeding the child.\n“Most significant prior conviction to what she was sentenced to state prison was eerily similar in the sense that time her seven-week-old baby was presented to the hospital very sick from methamphetamine overdose,” Ramsey said.\nAt the arraignment on June 6, Butte County Superior Court Judge Kristen Lucena held Scarbrough without bail. Scarbrough is due to return to court on June 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to enter a plea. She faces up to 10 years in state prison.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

Le operazioni di bonifica della massa nevosa, che ha invaso totalmente la pista e le reti di protezione, hanno permesso di escludere che vi fossero persone coinvolte. A provocare il distacco, secondo gli accertamenti della Polizia, sono stati due sciatori, entrati nella pista nonostante il divieto. Si sarebbero giustificati sostenendo che intendevano recuperare un bastoncino da sci. Il tracciato era chiuso proprio per i lavori di innevamento artificiale. (ANSA).\ndi Ansa\nCommenti",

    "text": "Teaching young people how to manage money helps them avoid financial pitfalls later in life – expert\nMoney lessons must be practical, relatable, age-appropriate\nSibongile MashabaNews Editor\nOur financial behaviours shape our future. So, when you are deliberate about making certain choices, you will find that you are able to move ahead with ease.\nA simple example could be to pack s'khafthin (lunch box) when you go to work. And being consistent. Imagine what this will do for your bank balance.\nHow are you empowering your children, nieces, nephews and grandchildren about making smart money choices? What challenges do you have with teaching them about money?\n“The earlier young people understand how to manage money, the better equipped they will be to make smart, confident decisions when they start earning, saving and spending on their own,” says JustMoney operations manager Sarah Nicholson.\n“Youth Month offers the perfect opportunity to talk about financial wellbeing as a family. It’s not about having all the answers. It’s about starting the conversation, making learning practical and fun, and showing young people that money is a tool they can learn to use with confidence.\n“Teaching young people how to manage money can begin with everyday chats at the dinner table, at the till, or when discussing family expenses. Money lessons work best when they are practical, relatable, and suited to your child’s stage of development.”\nNicholson says understanding “the concept of financial risk is a key skill that helps young people avoid money pitfalls and thrive later in life”\n“Just as we teach children to cross the road safely, we should also help them recognise and navigate financial dangers, such as impulse spending, scams, debt, and a lack of savings. Understanding financial risk is a life skill, not just an adult concern,” Nicholson says.\n“We often think of financial risk as something adults face – for example, defaulting on a loan or losing an investment. But the truth is that young people are often exposed to money decisions early on. Whether it’s peer pressure to have the latest gadget, being targeted by online scammers, or taking on a student loan without budgeting for repayments, choices made when you are young can have lasting consequences.”\nNicholson's age-appropriate savings tips:\nYoung children – start with the basics – needs vs wants and the power of saving: Children as young as five can begin learning the difference between what they need (food and school shoes) and what they want (sweets or a toy). You can make this lesson real by involving them in a shopping trip. Before heading out, show them a list: “We need bread, milk, and fruit. We don’t need coffee today – it’s not on the list.” To encourage saving, use a clear jar or a labelled tin and let your kids contribute coins towards something small they want.\nTweens and teens: Introduce budgeting and responsible spending: As children grow older, they can start earning a small allowance or pocket money, and learning how to manage it. For example, a parent might agree to give their child R150 a month. Instead of spending it all on fast food, the teen learns to divide up the money: R50 for weekend treats, R50 saved towards a phone cover, and R50 to put aside. Letting teens help plan a family purchase also builds confidence.\nOlder teens and young adults: Explore real-world financial tools and risks: This is a good time to go deeper into concepts like credit, interest, debt, and scams. If your 17-year-old is applying for tertiary education, use the opportunity to walk through a student loan agreement and explain repayment terms and interest. Introduce compound interest with a simple example: “If you invest R1,000 at 10% interest, you’ll have R1,100 after a year. But if you leave it there, you’ll earn interest on the R1,100 the next year – that’s compound growth.”\nWould you like to comment on this article?\nRegister (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.",

    "text": "An Indiana congressman is extremely upset about Chennedy Carter’s “excessive attack ” against Caitlin Clark, the celebrated rookie with the Indiana Fever.\nCongressman Jim Banks (R) fired off a letter to the WNBA on Tuesday, June 4, in response to the Chicago Sky guard Carter’s controversial hip check of Clark during Saturday’s game against the Indiana Fever, The Athletic reports.\nBlasting the “cheap shot,” Banks called for punishment against Carter, the Sky, and Carter’s teammate Angel Reese who was seen cheering the moment on.\n“Unfortunately, since joining the WNBA, Clark’s exceptionalism has been met with resentment and repeated attacks from fellow players,” Banks wrote. “Indiana is a basketball state. We don’t wince at aggressive defense, but this was not an example of playing ‘tough.’ It was a cheap shot that could have resulted in an injury and should not be tolerated.”\nChennedy Carter bumped Caitlin Clark for an away from the play foul 😳\n\"That's not a basketball play,\" Clark told ESPN on the broadcast. pic.twitter.com/udTMmWFVyn\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) June 1, 2024 Banks stressed the importance of protecting Clark due to her popularity, impact on WNBA viewership, and the future of the league.\n“Every data point shows, when Caitlin Clark plays, more people watch and what they are seeing right now is a league that refuses to hold hostile players accountable and enforce their own rules of sportsmanship,” he wrote. “It is not only a disservice to Clark and the Indiana Fever, it’s a disservice to the millions of young girls who are watching with dreams of playing in the WNBA one day.”\nBanks outlined a series of questions for WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert aimed at protecting Clark from “excessive physical targeting” and regulating players with a history of violence.\n“Do you believe that WNBA players repeatedly diminishing the talents of their fellow players is beneficial to the leagues’ overall success?” he wrote. “Do you believe that it is inspiring to young female athletes to see players like Indiana’s Caitlin Clark physically targeted for her success?”\nCarter’s initial away-from-ball foul against Clark was later upgraded to a flagrant 1 . It wasn’t the first time Carter has gotten herself in trouble for violent behavior.\nShe was suspended from the Atlanta Dream in 2021 due to “conduct detrimental to the team” after reportedly trying to fight her teammate Courtney Williams. She was later traded to the Los Angeles Sparks for the 2022 season.\nRELATED CONTENT: Angel Reese Sets Press Straight About WNBA Fouls And Player Popularity",

    "text": "„Das tut weh“: Beliebter Club in NRW schließt nach 30 Jahren\nEin weiterer Club in NRW schließt nach 30 Jahren endgültig. Eigentlich hatten die Betreiber Erweiterungspläne. Nun sprechen sie über die Gründe.\nWuppertal - In vielen Städten in Nordrhein-Westfalen kämpfen Clubs und Kneipen um ihre Existenzen. Oftmals spielen Nachwirkungen der Corona-Pandemie hier eine Rolle. Aber auch das Ausgehverhalten der Menschen hat sich über die Jahre verändert. Nun trifft es auch einen etablierten Club in Wuppertal, der besonders für seine Reggae-Konzerte bekannt ist.\n„Musik, Community & Clubkultur verlieren ihr Zuhause. Nach über 30 Jahren Clubkultur in Wuppertal haben wir die schwerste Entscheidung unserer Geschichte getroffen“, heißt es auf der Website des U-Clubs in Wuppertal. Der beliebte Club an der Friedrich-Ebert-Straße 191 wird zum Ende des Jahres schließen. Bereits 30 Jahre gab es die Diskothek in der Stadt im Bergischen Land.\n„Schwerste Entscheidung unserer Geschichte“: Club schließt nach 30 Jahren\nÜber die Jahre haben die Betreiber immer wieder frische Konzepte und Ideen eingebracht, um den U-Club zu halten. Zuletzt sei in den Club noch ordentlich investiert worden, unter anderem in neue, moderne Licht und Tontechnik. Doch der Wandel der Zeit lasse sich nicht aufhalten, heißt es.\nDie Betreiber seien an harte, unüberwindbare Grenzen gestoßen. Es sei im Sinne der Club-Betreiber gewesen, einen bewirtschafteten Außenbereich zu schaffen und unter anderem diesen zum Wupperufer zugänglich zu machen. Darüber hinaus hatten die Betreiber den Wunsch, den Club in zwei unabhängige Bereiche aufzuteilen. Damit hätte man kleinere Veranstaltungen parallel laufen lassen können, heißt es zu den Plänen. „Doch diese Ideen sind an diesem Standort nicht umsetzbar“, teilen die Betreiber mit.\nClub-Betreiber haben noch einige Pläne vor endgültiger Schließung\n„Der U-Club ist nicht mehr zeitgemäß betreibbar – und wirtschaftlich nicht tragbar. Das tut weh. Richtig weh“, heißt es weiter in der Schließungsankündigung auf der Club-Website. Doch bevor es so weit ist und die Türen der Diskothek am 31. Dezember zum letzten Mal öffnen, haben die Betreiber noch einige Pläne. Ab dem 1. August möchte der Club das Abschiedsprogramm veröffentlichen und im September die beliebten Veranstaltungsreihen zurückholen.\n„Wir sagen Danke. Für all die Nächte, die ihr mit Leben gefüllt habt. Für jede Erinnerung, die hier entstanden ist“, schreiben die Betreiber. In dem Video zur Schließung, das auf dem Instagram-Account des U-Clubs gepostet wurde, verkünden viele Menschen ihre Trauer über die Schließung.\nSo schreibt Rapperin Nura: „Danke für die geilsten Jahre meiner Jugend. U Club bleibt Legende“. „Es ist so bitter! Seit 18 Jahren mein Lieblingsclub.. so viele Leute kennengelernt, geile Konzerte besucht, unzählige Partys gefeiert, so viel gelacht und noch viel mehr getanzt“, kommentiert eine weitere Nutzerin.\nEin Club in Bochum verabschiedet sich derweil wohl doch nicht endgültig. Neue Termine wecken Hoffnung. Indessen bleibt die Zukunft vage.",

    "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – An All-American and Big Ten medalist as a student-athlete, alumna Caitlin Hamilton is returning to campus with an extensive coaching résumé as she rejoins Purdue Women’s Swimming & Diving as the program’s associate head coach.\nHamilton teams up again with Purdue head coach John Klinge, who she swam for from 2019-13 during Klinge’s early years as the leader of the Boilermakers.\nSince earning bachelor’s degrees in movement and sports sciences and public health from Purdue, Hamilton has served as the head coach at Illinois State (2020-23) as well as an associate coach at Kentucky (2023-25) and assistant at Indiana (2017-19), IUPUI (2015-17) and Wyoming (2014-15). She brought her Illinois State team to the Purdue Invitational in the fall of 2021 and 2022.\n“I’m thrilled to have Caitlin return to campus and rejoin our team, working alongside me and everyone at the Burke Aquatic Center,” Klinge said. “She was an All-American and Big Ten medalist at our pool and has enjoyed an impactful coaching career since graduating from Purdue. She gained valuable experience as a head coach, and as an assistant –both here in the state of Indiana and in the SEC. Caitlin was the obvious choice and I’m grateful she’s back.”\nAt Illinois State, Hamilton’s swimmers won 10 individual Missouri Valley Conference titles. The Redbirds finished second at the MVC Championships in 2022, their best showing since 2014. A year later, the team broke 12 school records, including all five relay marks. Kiersten Farley-Sepe (2020) and Madyson Morse (2023) were both MVC Swimmer of the Year standouts. Morse was also the conference’s two-time Scholar-Athlete of the Year for swimming.\n“I would like to express my gratitude to John Klinge and senior associate athletics director Ed Howat for the opportunity to return home to Purdue,” Hamilton said. “Their excitement for the future of Purdue Swimming is undeniable, and I am deeply thankful for their trust in me to be a part of it. Having the opportunity to work alongside the head coach I swam for is something truly special. Boiler Nation, I am ever grateful. Boiler Up!”\nKentucky head coach Bret Lundgaard brought Hamilton to Lexington after he took over the program in the summer of 2023. The UK women had multiple swimmers qualify for the NCAA Championships both years Hamilton was part of the coaching staff. The Kentucky men finished 20th at NCAAs this year.\nIndiana won three Big Ten titles (two men, one women) over Hamilton’s two seasons as part of Ray Looze’s coaching staff in Bloomington, including sweeping the men’s and women’s championships (for the first time) in 2019. Ian Finnerty and Lilly King headlined IU’s NCAA Championships while Hamilton was part of the coaching staff. As a team at NCAAs, the IU men were top three and the women top 10 both years.\nAs a recruiting coordinator for the women’s team at IUPUI, Hamilton assembled a group of signees in 2017 that was the highest-ranked class in program history. The Jaguars eclipsed 37 team records altogether across the two genders while she was on staff.\nAs a student-athlete at Purdue, Hamilton was a distance freestyle standout that set program records in the 500-, 1,000- and 1,650-yard freestyle. Her team freshman records in the in 1,000 and 1,650 free still stand, enjoying the longest lifespan of any active first-year benchmarks in the record book. She continues to rank second overall in the 1,000 and 1,650 free, with only All-American and World University Games medalist Kaersten Meitz eclipsing Hamilton’s records.\nAn All-American as a top-eight finisher in the 1,650 free as a freshman at the 2010 NCAA Championships, Hamilton accounted for the top finish by a Purdue swimmer as the Boilermaker Aquatic Center hosted the national championship meet. Purdue finished 16th nationally in 2010 for the program’s best-ever showing. She returned to NCAAs the following season, scoring again in the mile (11th overall) as an honorable mention All-American. She also qualified for NCAAs in the 500 both years.\nAt the Big Ten Championships, Hamilton won a silver medal in the mile each of her underclassman years to be a two-time second-team All-Big Ten honoree.\nHamilton served as an undergraduate assistant coach with the Boilermakers and also worked for the John Purdue Club before moving out to Wyoming for the 2014-15 school year. The Cowboys had four conference champions and an NCAA qualifier during her year in Laramie.\nShe was a three-time Academic All-Big Ten honoree at Purdue.\nHamilton and her husband, Josh Kolbus, became parents in February, welcoming daughter Addison to the family.\nHamilton Returns as Associate Head Coach\nAll-American & Big Ten medalist returns to Purdue to join John Klinge's coaching staff",
