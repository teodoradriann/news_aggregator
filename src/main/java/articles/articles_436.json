    "text": "Chief Justice Martha Koome has ordered the closure of Makadara Law Courts until Monday next week following a shooting incident on Thursday. This comes hours after the news of a shooting incident involving a magistrate working at the Nairobi-based court and a senior police officer broke on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, CJ Koome says Principal Magistrate Monicah Kivuti sustained serious injuries after she was shot by a senior police officer. “The Judiciary strongly condemns this act of violence and calls upon the national security agencies to respond to this occurrence with utmost urgency and sensitivity,” the CJ says. The Chief Justice explains that the gunman forced his way into the court through the magistrate’s entrance and shot her. Before the shooting, the magistrate had sent for an accused person who had failed to show up in court several times to remand pending a probation report. “Before her appearance in Court on June 13, 2024, the accused had absconded appearance severally having been released on bond. She indicated that she had been unwell. The court ordered that a probation report be prepared and remanded the accused in custody pending provision of the report,” CJ Koome explains. The magistrate sustained serious gunshot injuries on the chest and pelvic areas. Efforts by other police officers to intervene at the court left two officers with serious injuries. \"Unfortunately, the perpetrator sustained fatal injuries\". After the incident, Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome assured the Judiciary of safety, saying investigations into the incident are underway.",
