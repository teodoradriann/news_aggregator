    "text": "California, United States - April 23, 2025 - Larine Co., a California-based company dedicated to practical dental care innovations, has announced the release of its latest product—LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum. Designed to promote oral health through scientifically supported ingredients, the gum offers a convenient solution for individuals seeking to enhance their dental care habits beyond conventional methods.\nA Modern Take on Dental Care\nFormulated with xylitol and hydroxyapatite, two ingredients backed by dental research, LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum is crafted to support the natural process of remineralization—a key mechanism in maintaining tooth enamel strength. The gum provides an accessible alternative for users aiming to integrate more oral health support into their daily routines.\nEach pack contains 18 pieces and comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Since its recent market debut, the company reports over 320,000 units sold in five countries, generating an estimated $5 million in total sales.\nScience-Driven Formulation\nXylitol, a plant-derived sweetener, has been shown to help reduce harmful oral bacteria that contribute to cavities. Hydroxyapatite, a calcium-based mineral naturally present in tooth enamel, has gained attention for its role in promoting enamel repair by binding to and reinforcing the tooth surface.\n“These ingredients were selected based on their established benefits in oral health science,” said the company’s spokesperson Matthew DeWitte. “We wanted to create a product that’s both effective and easy to incorporate into everyday life.”\nSupporting Enamel and Gum Health\nIn addition to remineralization, the gum formulation also targets other key areas of oral wellness. Ingredients such as mastic, myrrh, and acacia have been included for their potential to support gum health and freshen breath naturally. The product is especially useful in addressing oral pH balance, helping to shift the mouth to a more alkaline state that favors enamel maintenance.\nNot a Replacement—A Complement\nLarine Co. emphasizes that LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum is intended as a complementary tool and not a replacement for brushing or flossing. It is ideal for individuals looking for an additional layer of dental care in settings where traditional oral hygiene routines may be less accessible.\nTo learn more about LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum and explore its full ingredient profile, visit https://buylarine.com.\nAbout Larine Co.\nLarine Co. is committed to developing oral health products that merge scientific research with everyday functionality. Based in California, the company focuses on accessible solutions designed to empower individuals in maintaining lifelong dental wellness.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Larine Co.\nContact Person: Matthew DeWitte\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://buylarine.com/",

    "text": "The honors are dubious, but boy, so is the tech ces The Consumer Electronics Show is back to showcase not just the cutting edge of innovation but also the worst of what's possible when modern tech collides with today's culture of capitalist excess.\nAs they have for the past several years, a group of repairability, sustainability, and privacy advocates have come together to present the CES Worst in Show awards again this year. Six categories of failure are awarded by the participants annually, with products being lampooned for being unrepairable, insecure, privacy nightmares, environmentally unfriendly, generally unasked for, and just plain worst of the show.\nAnd boy, are there some doozies to catalog from Las Vegas this year.\nYoutube Video\nA $2,200 smart ring with a short-lived battery?\nTaking the prize for the least repairable is the Ultrahuman Rare, described by the company as the \"world's first luxury smart ring,\" which likely puts it in the running for the \"who asked for this\" prize, too.\niFixit CEO Kyle Wiens, who presented the award for Ultrahuman's repairability fail, said that despite a price tag of $2,200, the Rare's battery is only rated for 500 charge cycles, and replacing it is impossible without destroying the ring.\n\"Luxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,\" iFixit said of the ring. To be fair to Ultrahuman, it says the Rare - which seems to have the same internals as its more modestly priced $349 Air ring - is able to hold a charge for up to six days. At 500 charge cycles, this translates to just over eight years of potential use, assuming minimal degradation, which means it would likely be obsolete by the time the battery dies. Either way, you're still out more than two grand for the privilege.\nThe smart crib that is always watching\nBosch took to CES to demonstrate its \"Revol\" smart crib that uses AI to keep an eye on its occupant via a camera, microphone and even a radar sensor.\n\"One of the things we hate most at EFF is products that play on people's…\nBrandon Vigliarolo",

Four other survivors from the incident are still admitted and under treatment at the state-run facility.\nSonal was travelling in a van with her husband, children, and other relatives from Mujpur village in Padra taluka to Bagdana near Bhavnagar when the accident occurred. The bridge collapsed shortly after the vehicle began its journey, leading to the death of her husband Ramesh Padhiyar (38), daughter Vedika (4), son Naitik (2), and three other family members.\nFollowing the incident, five injured were brought to SSGH for treatment. Along with Sonal, the others admitted were Narendrasinh Parmar, Gannpatsinh Rajput, Raju Hathiya, and Dilip Padhiyar.\nAccording to Dr Hitendra Chauhan, in-charge RMO at the hospital, one of the patients underwent surgery on Wednesday while another was scheduled for surgery on Thursday.

    "text": "Los trabajadores de Boeing en Estados Unidos han decidido convocar una huelga, la primera desde 2008, tras rechazar la propuesta acordada por los sindicatos y la empresa. Las plantillas de Seattle y Portland han decidido detener la producción al considerar insuficiente la subida salarial del 25% para los próximos cuatro años que contempla el documento.\nEsta será la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años. La última tuvo lugar en 2008, con un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción. Las protestas le costaron a la firma americana unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como WSJ y Financial Times .\nEn concreto, cerca del 95% de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) votaron en contra del acuerdo que incluía la citada subida salarial. En este sentido, los trabajadores señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento y a tenor de la subida del coste de la vida.\nAsí afecta la bajada de los tipos de interés a las hipotecas: si tienes una variable, vas a empezar a ahorrar dinero María Bosque Senero Esta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines en pleno vuelo. Asimismo, acentuará la falta de recursos en el sector aéreo.\nEl nuevo director ejecutivo de Boeing , Kelly Ortberg , había pedido a los trabajadores que no hicieran huelga y realizó varias visitas a las fábricas. Los miembros del Distrito 751 de la IAM representan a unos 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing.\n¿Te ha resultado interesante esta noticia?\nMás noticias de Economía",

Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles. Ersten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es. Ein großer Rettungseinsatz Mehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an. Etwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.",

    "text": "Donald Trump has finally found an acceptable way to arm Ukraine: he will ask European allies to donate their weapons, then sell them American replacements.\nNow comes the hard part — agreeing on who will actually hand over their systems, including the Patriot missile batteries that Kiev is desperately seeking. Some Patriot air defense systems are expected to arrive in Ukraine “within days,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday. “We’re going to produce state-of-the-art weapons, and they’re going to be sent to NATO,” he said.\nExpensive Patriot batteries, which are in high demand among American allies, have proven effective in shooting down Russian ballistic missiles.\nBut since the announcement, it has become clear that Trump has presented a framework, not a detailed plan. The extent of the support for Ukraine will depend on upcoming negotiations over who will provide the equipment, ten U.S. and European officials told Reuters.\n“As always with these things, the devil is in the details,” said one Northern European ambassador in Washington.\nThe plan, which, according to sources in the British agency, Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte agreed on in recent days, has been met with a positive reception in Ukraine and among its allies. However, some in Europe have expressed dissatisfaction that they are the ones who will bear the real cost of Trump's announcement. During a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Rutte mentioned six NATO member states - Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada - that are ready to participate in the arms purchase scheme.\nSenior sources at the embassies of two of those countries in the United States told Reuters they only learned about the plan when it was made public. “I have the distinct impression that no one was briefed in detail about the plan in advance,” said one European ambassador. “I also suspect that even within the administration itself they are only now starting to work out what it all means in practice.”\nDo you have a spare “patriot”?\n“Several European countries have already committed to supporting this initiative, including Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and Finland,” a NATO official said. “The details are still being negotiated.”\nA meeting of Patriot-owning countries and donors to Ukraine, aimed at finding additional Patriot batteries for Kiev, chaired by NATO's top military commander, could be held next Wednesday, a source close to the talks told Reuters.\nA source familiar with the situation said the US had signaled a willingness to send additional offensive weapons as part of a proposed deal with European allies - even though Trump has said Ukraine should refrain from attacking Moscow.\nKurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Trump has found a way to balance support for Ukraine with political realities within the Republican Party. Some prominent members of Trump's MAGA movement oppose U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nHaving European allies fund US arms sales “is completely consistent with what he said during the campaign,” Volker said. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would force European countries to spend more on defense, which drew cheers from his supporters. “They have to pay,” he said. “If they don’t pay, we’re not going to protect them.”\nVolker said that Ukraine could ultimately receive between 12 and 13 Patriot batteries, but that their delivery could take a full year.\nWe are ready.\nTrump's rapid escalation of rhetoric toward Moscow is a result of a belief that Putin is not entering negotiations in good faith, US officials said.\nOne of the officials told Reuters that Trump had become aware that Putin's ambitions went beyond Crimea and four eastern regions of Ukraine - something Kiev and its European allies have publicly and frequently pointed out.\nNow, according to three US officials involved in arms issues, the real work is just beginning.\nU.S. officials are currently talking to NATO allies to assess who is willing to send weapons to Ukraine. European officials have generally indicated a willingness. Another official said the Trump administration is searching NATO stockpiles to see what is available. The next step, the official said, is to try to persuade allies to donate equipment to Ukraine in exchange for some kind of “trade.”\n\"We are ready to participate,\" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, ahead of a meeting of European Union ministers.\nOne official cited Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain as good candidates for sending a battery of Patriot systems to Kiev. However, some countries, including Greece and Spain, have previously rejected calls from allies to provide some of their systems to Ukraine, arguing that the systems are essential to the defense of their countries and NATO as a whole.\nTensions\nTrump’s move to take credit for additional weapons going to Ukraine has caused mild tensions in Europe. “If we are paying for those weapons, then that is our help,” EU foreign policy chief Kaia Kallas said after a meeting in Brussels. “So that is European support and we are doing everything we can to help Ukraine... If you promise to give weapons but say someone else will pay for them, then you are not really giving them, are you?”\nTrump told reporters that one country had 17 Patriot systems, some of which would go directly to Ukraine. The announcement caused confusion among European allies and in the US Congress, Reuters sources said.\nNo NATO member other than the United States possesses that many Patriot systems, two sources familiar with the matter said, leading to speculation that Trump may have been referring to individual components of the Patriot system, such as launchers or missiles.\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who was at the Pentagon on Monday, said Germany would be talking to the United States in the coming days or weeks about sending Patriot batteries to Ukraine. But he stressed that none of the batteries would arrive in Kiev for months.\nAnother official said Trump is personally involved in the negotiations, although the talks have been “vague so far.” “So far, everyone has said, ‘We can help,’” the official said. “But what exactly that means — we don’t know yet.”\nBonus video:",

    "title": "Un “desmadre”: periodistas críticos del debate Trump-Biden de 2020 moderarán el de hoy",
    "text": "Los reconocidos periodistas Jake Tapper y Dana Bash, dos de los rostros más populares de la cadena CNN, son los encargados de moderar este jueves el primero y trascendental [debate presidencial](https://gestion.pe/mundo/eeuu/elecciones-en-estados-unidos-joe-biden-y-donald-trump-cara-a-cara-en-un-crucial-debate-presidencial-presidencia-de-eeuu-noticia/) entre Joe Biden y Donald Trump antes de las elecciones del 5 de noviembre. Hace cuatro años, ambos periodistas fueron muy críticos con las formas y el caos del primer debate de 2020, en el que hubo gritos e interrupciones constantes de [Trump contra Biden](https://gestion.pe/mundo/eeuu/elecciones-en-estados-unidos-debate-joe-biden-donald-trump-noticia/), quien perdió la paciencia y le respondió: “¿Quieres callarte, hombre?”. En un programa inmediatamente posterior para comentar lo sucedido, Tapper, uno de los presentadores estrella del canal, lamentó que el cara a cara estuvo “horrible” y “no fue un debate, sino un desastre por culpa del presidente Trump, quien estuvo todo el tiempo interrumpiendo, incumpliendo las reglas y mintiendo”. Bash, comentarista en el mismo espacio y veterana periodistas parlamentaria, fue más allá y lo calificó de “desmadre”. Cuatro años después, ambos periodistas afrontan el difícil reto de moderar un nuevo debate entre Biden y Trump, en el que tendrán que hacer valer las normas sin convertirse en protagonistas de la jornada, pero ¿quiénes son Jake Tapper y Dana Bash? LEA TAMBIÉN: [Biden y Trump, cara a cara en un crucial debate presidencial] Tapper, presentador estrella de la CNN Nacido en 1969 en Nueva York, Tapper es el corresponsal jefe en Washington y uno de los presentadores estrella de la CNN, cadena a la que se unió en 2013 tras pasar por ABC News. Ganó varios premios por sus reportajes de las elecciones de 2016, comicios que llevaron a Trump a la Presidencia, y ha moderado distintos debates en televisión, incluido uno de las primarias republicanas de 2016 y el último debate de las primarias demócratas de 2020 entre Biden y Bernie Sanders. En sus programas ha entrevistado a mandatarios como el propio Biden, a Boris Johnson (Reino Unido), a Emmanuel Macron (Francia), a Olaf Scholz (Alemania), a Justin Trudeau (Canadá) y a Volodímir Zelenski (Ucrania). Tapper organiza anualmente una subasta para construir casas para veteranos estadounidenses gravemente heridos en las guerras de Irak y Afganistán, conflictos que él mismo cubrió como reportero. Bash, especialista en Congreso y debates Dana Bash, originaria también de Nueva York, donde nació en 1971, es una de las reporteras de política más destacadas de la CNN y copresenta un programa dominical junto a Tapper. Durante varios años fue la corresponsal jefa de la cadena en el Congreso, destapando varias exclusivas, y cubrió además varias elecciones de medio mandato, siguiendo tanto las campañas de los demócratas como de los republicanos. Los debates electorales no son una novedad para Bash, quien moderó seis de los debates de las primarias republicanas de 2016 y dos debates de las demócratas en 2020. Tanto Bash como Tapper moderaron además el primer debate republicano de las primarias de este año, aunque Trump se negó a participar. LEA TAMBIÉN: [Momentos inolvidables de los debates presidenciales estadounidenses] Señalados por Trump El expresidente republicano sí accedió a estar en el cara a cara este jueves de la CNN a pesar de que suele arremeter contra esta cadena, a la que acusa constantemente de propagar “noticias falsas” por desmontar sus bulos. Los moderadores deberán lidiar con un Trump desafiante, que lleva días caldeando el ambiente previo al debate al asegurar que no habrá una pelea justa porque tendrá que enfrentarse a tres oponentes, en referencia a Biden y a los dos periodistas. La propia CNN interrumpió el lunes una entrevista con Karoline Leavitt, asistente de prensa del republicano, después de que ella asegurara que Trump afrontará un “ambiente hostil” con dos moderadores que hacen “una cobertura sesgada de él”.

    "text": "El cuerpo sepultado a nombre de Dulce Marmolejo fue exhumado luego de que la Fiscalía General del Estado de Guanajuato le informara a su mamá, María Teresa, que hay inconsistencias que hacen pensar que el cuerpo es de un hombre.\nLuego de cinco años de haber llorado y enterrado a su hija, María Teresa afirma que volvió a desaparecer su hija, pues ahora no sabe dónde están los verdaderos restos de la joven.\nCon domicilio en Irapuato, la joven fue sustraída de su casa en la colonia Santa Julia el 16 de julio de 2020, cuando sujetos armados irrumpieron en el lugar y, tras golpear a un hombre, regresaron por la joven.\nEn agosto de ese año, la Fiscalía informó a María Teresa que su hija había sido localizada sin vida en un predio en la comunidad de Marroquín perteneciente a Apaseo el Alto, junto con otros cuatro cuerpos. Días después, fue sepultada y despedida por sus familiares.\nCinco años después, la madre de Dulce recibió una llamada de la Fiscalía: querían que fuera a las oficinas en Celaya. Ella les dijo que no podía por su trabajo, por lo que el funcionario fue hasta Irapuato para notificarle que los restos que había sepultado no eran de su hija.\n“Que se iba a hacer la exhumación porque había piezas que no coincidían, porque ahí en el Semefo había un torso y un cráneo. Mi hermana y mi hermano vieron el cuerpo completo pero resulta que, como había muchos cuerpos, supuestamente los revolvieron”, explicó vía telefónica la madre de la joven víctima.\nExige la entrega de los restos de su hija\nMaría Teresa recuerda que, desde un principio, manifestó dudas de que fuera su hija y tras conocer la carpeta de investigación, dice que en el expediente el cuerpo no registra las cicatrices que su hija tenía y que ella reportó oportunamente. Ahora la madre, quien forma parte del colectivo “Hasta Encontrarte”, se pregunta dónde está el cuerpo de su hija.\n\"Yo voy a entregar un cuerpo que no es de mi hija, no es mío, entonces mi pregunta es ¿dónde está lo mío? ¿el de mi hija?. Hasta donde yo entendí, me dicen que el cuerpo que está dentro de la caja es la cara de mi hija pero el cuerpo de un hombre.\n\"No es justo lo que están haciendo, nosotros estamos con el corazón herido y nos vuelven a abrir esa herida, con la duda de dónde está mi ser querido, ¿donde está mi hija? Que hagan su trabajo como debe de ser”, dijo.",
