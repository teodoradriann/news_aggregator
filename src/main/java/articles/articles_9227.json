    "text": "Learn why lung cancer led the drop in cancer mortality rates, but cancer forms related to obesity continue to rise. By Paul Smaglik Apr 23, 2025 9:45 PM Apr 23, 2025 9:46 PM\nLung cancer illustration. (Image Credit: Nemes Laszlo/Shutterstock) Newsletter Sign up for our email newsletter for the latest science news Sign Up Both lung cancer diagnoses and deaths in men and women have declined over the past 20 years. That trend has helped improve the overall cancer mortality picture. Twenty years of cancer data indicate a slow, gradual, but significant change, with overall deaths declining 2.1 percent a year from 2001 to 2018 and 1.5 percent a year from 2018 to 2022.\n“Progress has been made in reducing overall cancer mortality, largely driven by sustained declines in lung cancer,” according to the report “The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer (ARN).”\nTo decrease the odds of dying from cancer, 20 years of data reported by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) suggests to stop any kind of tobacco use, and focus on weight loss.\nImprovement in Cancer Mortality There may be room for even more improvement if tobacco use continues to decline and innovation in lung cancer treatment continues. More screening (only about 18 percent of eligible adults are tested for lung cancer) for that form of the disease could also help catch it earlier, thus leading to more effective treatment.\n“Despite remarkable progress, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death,” according to the report.\nHowever, the incidence of cancers associated with obesity grew during the 20-year study period. Those forms of cancer include female breast, uterus, colon and rectum, pancreas, kidney, and liver cancers.\n“Contrary to the rapid declines in incidence rates in smoking-associated cancers, incidence rates are increasing for multiple cancers, particularly those associated with excess body weight,” according to the report.\nRead More: Aspirin Might Be the Next Big Thing in Fighting the Spread of Cancer\nSigns of Successful Cancer Treatments Although the report doesn’t explicitly state it, one positive picture the data paints is that cancer treatment seems to show slow, steady improvement. That’s because, broadly speaking, cancer incidence isn’t dropping as steadily as cancer deaths. In men, diagnoses decreased from 2001 through 2013 and then plateaued through 2021. In women, overall cancer incidence actually rose slightly every year from 2003 through 2021, except for 2020.\nThere are also some disease-specific indicators that point to improved cancer treatment. For example, although new diagnoses of breast cancer slowly rose over the study period, the death rate from it decreased in the same time frame.\nGender Differences The data also points out many gender differences in terms of both cancer incidence and mortality. For instance, even though rates have declined, then steadied in men, while they are slowly ticking up in women, men still have both an overall higher incident rate and death rate than women.\nDifferent forms of the disease are prominent in each gender. Prostate cancer is the most common form in men, while stomach cancer leads in prevalence in women.\nAlthough not universal, the data also shows some variations by race and ethnicity. For example, Black women with breast cancer have a 40 percent higher death rate than White women with the disease, “[…] a disparity that has persisted for decades,” according to the report.\nRead More: The Gut Microbiome Could Help Our Bodies Fight Cancer\nMore Cancer Battles Ahead In general, the report summarizes gradual progress in the war against cancer, but could benefit from more attention and progress in specific battles.\n“Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment. However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated,” the report concluded.\nThis article is not offering medical advice and should be used for informational purposes only.",

    "text": "“Oceans are not merely vast areas of water; they serve as sources of life,” he said. \"They control the climate, provide food, and offer a great deal of economic opportunity.\"\nIn his speech at the launch of Ocean Accounts in Denpasar, Bali, on Friday, Luhut highlighted that the blue economy focuses on the sustainable utilization of marine resources. This approach aims to stimulate economic growth, create job opportunities, and preserve the marine ecosystem.\nHe remarked that adopting a blue economy can facilitate Indonesia's transition to renewable energy, boost tourism, and strengthen the fisheries sector. These efforts contribute significantly to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), amounting to over US$270 billion annually.\nIndonesia, with 17,500 islands and 70 percent of its territories covered by water, is believed to be home to 8,500 fish species. The nation has the potential to produce about 50 million tons of fish per year, Luhut stated.\nAmong Indonesia’s featured marine and fishery commodities are seaweed, prawns, lobsters, crabs, and tilapia.\nLuhut also stressed the importance of proper marine waste management as a key aspect of implementing the blue economy.\n“The government has been striving to process waste into energy and other materials, with the objective of reducing the amount of waste leaking into the ocean,” he pointed out.\nLuhut encouraged the nation to capitalize on its vast waters to develop blue carbon and play a more prominent role in global trade, considering that around 45 percent of international shipping activities rely on passage through Indonesian waters.\nRelated news:\nHandling climate change is key to developing aquaculture: VP Amin\nRelated news:\nGovt to strengthen legal framework for blue economy policies\nTranslator: Dewa Ketut, Tegar Nurfitra\nEditor: Anton Santoso\nCopyright © ANTARA 2024",
