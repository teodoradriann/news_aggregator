    "title": "Keystone graduate Gideon ‘ESPN’ Lampron is living up to the middle name at UD Football – Morning Journal",
    "text": "Gideon “ESPN” Lampron has always wanted to put on a show on the gridiron.\nLampron did it at Keystone. Two years later, he found his fit at Dayton, where he stars at linebacker.\n“This is something that I have been wanting for so long,” he said. “I’ve always wanted the responsibility of starting, especially at the college level. This is something that I have been dreaming of since I was in eighth grade. It’s been surreal, but I have been expecting it.”\nDayton defeated St. Francis, 18-10, in its season opener. He was such a force in his first start, Lampron was awarded the FCS National Defensive Player of the Week.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Dayton Flyers Football (@daytonflyersfb)\nHe had six solo tackles (11 total), a pair of forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, one sack and three tackles for loss.\n“I feel like he’s been handling the expectations well,” Dayton Coach Trevor Andrews said. “He was the national defensive player of the week, so I’d say I feel exceptional about it right now. No pressure, but all he has got to do is repeat the same performance every week and I’ll be very happy with him.”\nWhen looking at Lampron’s social media pages, the name ESPN could appear as a nickname for the former Wildcat. However, it is actually his middle name, given by his father Marty, an avid sports fan.\n“I want to make my dad proud, because him making my middle name ‘ESPN,’ it has set some expectations. I am just trying to deliver,” he said. “(Marty Lampron) loves watching me play sports more than anything in his life.”\nGideon’s original middle name was set to be Xavior. Marty Lampron vetoed it and had it set to ESPN, all caps and pronounced by the letters for the Entertainment Sports Programming Network.\n“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” Lampron said. “Some of my friends would laugh. I never really hid it, I just never talked about it ever. Now, this is something that my friends are finding out. I have it on my Instagram and (X). I love (my middle name).”\nLampron was the Keystone leader at linebacker and running back. So much so, he was named as one of nine finalists for Ohio Mr. Football in 2021.\nThat is one of many accolades he acquired in LaGrange, as he was also awarded the Matt Wilhelm Award his junior year and Lorain County Golden Helmet award in his senior season.\nKeystone running back Gideon Lampron takes advantage of the opening the offense created for him and moves the ball upfield. (Jennifer Forbus – for The Morning Journal) He had a fresh start at Dayton, as his teammates were just as talented. He stuck to it and kept working his way through his first two seasons, and he contributed on special teams.\nDuring his time, Dayton went through a coaching change to Andrews, a UD alum, in 2023, which was after Lampron’s freshman year.\n“Right after I got the job here in January of 2023 is when I first found out. I thought the guys were messing with me,” Andrews said. “But Jake Speller, our operations director was with the previous staff, told me (ESPN) really was his middle name. I thought his dad was either really awesome or out of his mind.”\nThere were also changes to the linebacker coaches. Once it was set to Coach Paul Amakihe, Lampron’s career began to take off.\n“I gotta give a lot of the success that I have had to Coach A (Amakihe),” he said. “It’s been him. I have learned so much from him. Spending so much time with him, we have such a great relationship. He coaches me hard, but I wouldn’t want it any other way.”\nIn the linebacking group, two leaders are assigned to become the spark plugs, brains and the brawn of the defense.\n“As a teammate, Gideon (Lampron) is very well-liked,” Andrews said. “He plays with great effort and energy. He has very quick reaction skills so he makes a lot of impact plays. That potential has always been there, but he wasn’t always going in the right direction. Now that he has more experience, confidence under his belt and a year in our scheme, he has become more confident and that’s translating to the production that you’re seeing now.”\nDayton is 1-0. The Flyers have a bye-week in Week 2, and their next game will be against Indiana State, which played Purdue in Week 1. The Boilermarkers have Lampron’s former Keystone teammate Ryne Shackelford on their roster.\n“One thing (I’ve noticed), especially after watching the game on film is that I could have played so much better,” he said. “Now I just have to keep the same energy. I can’t keep reading my own headlines. We still have a lot more football to be played. I am not satisfied.”\nDayton’s next game is scheduled for Sept. 14, which will be broadcast on ESPN+.",

Segnalati anche incidenti stradali e auto ferme.\n Particolarmente caotica la situazione nel centro storico, tra Colosseo, Circo Massimo e lungotevere, ma anche nell’area nord-ovest della città.\nOdissea per passeggeri in arrivo da Dubai\nOdissea per i passeggeri a bordo di un Boeing 777 della Emirates il cui arrivo a Roma era previsto per le 18:45. A causa del forte maltempo che imperversa sulla Capitale, il volo è stato deviato su Ciampino con un atterraggio, riferiscono alcuni passeggeri all’ANSA, “da incubo”. Il volo si trova ancora a Ciampino in attesa del rifornimento di carburante necessario per ritornare sullo scalo di Fiumicino e atterrare, infine, al Leonardo da Vinci come previsto. “Siamo bloccati sulla pista – riferiscono alcuni passeggeri -, in attesa di poter ripartire.

    "text": "Salta il Decreto Crescita, scenario apocalittico: “Juve, Milan e Roma rischiano di essere distrutte”\nLo scenario tracciato dal senatore di Forza Italia e presidente della Lazio, Claudio Lotito (nella foto), è apocalittico. La\nmancata proroga del Decreto Crescita assesta un colpo tremendo al calcio italiano. Definisce lo stralcio della misura dal provvedimento Milleproroghe avvenuto in Consiglio dei Ministri una \"bella e grande fesseria\". Prefigura una perdita di competitività progressiva della Serie A: \"L'anno scorso abbiamo portato tre squadre in tutte e tre le finali, adesso voglio vedere che fine facciamo…\". E attacca l'Aic (Associazione Italia Calciatori) che s'era detta contraria al rinnovo della delibera per altri due mesi (fino a febbraio 2024) scrivendo una lettera al Governo.\nLa discussione in CdM è stata accesa e il comunicato della Lega\nsugli \"sconti fiscali immorali\" previsti per i calciatori è stato un diretto duro da incassare per lo stesso massimo dirigente: lo aveva caldeggiato e ora, a meno che in Parlamento non si prenda direzione differente, sul tavolo resta un tema spinoso per tutte le società per la morsa nella quale finiranno a partire dal prossimo mese di gennaio (niente più agevolazioni per il tesseramento di sportivi provenienti dall'estero).\n\"Si accorgeranno di che cavolo di errore è stato fatto – ha ammesso Lotito, come riportato dal sito notizie.com -. Se tu hai uno straniero che paga le tasse in Italia sarà meglio di uno che non viene e non le paga no? Voglio vedere chi viene adesso…\".\nL’abolizione non avrà effetti retroattivi: i club che hanno contratti in essere non perderanno i benefici fiscali e ne godranno per un massimo di cinque anni; quanto alla questione rinnovi, quelli sanciti entro il 31 dicembre (\nè il caso di Osimhen col Napoli, ufficializzato nei giorni scorsi – foto in basso) non vedranno scemate le agevolazioni. Ma dal 1° gennaio 2024 in poi cambierà tutto e gli sgravi non saranno più applicabili.\n\"La Lazio ha i suoi contratti, ma non è tanto quello il tema – ha aggiunto Lotito a corredo dello sfogo -. Il vero problema è che alcune società… grandi club com la Juventus, il Milan (\ntra le società che ha risparmiato di più finora, ndr) e la Roma potrebbero anche essere distrutte da questo tipo di situazione. Adesso chi era contrario a questa cosa ci farà vedere cosa sarà in grado di fare\".\nIl riferimento per niente affatto velato è all'Aic: \"Era contraria. Ma ha detto delle cose talmente infondate e che sono fuori da ogni logica. Quale? Questo decreto rappresenterebbe un problema per la crescita dei vivai italiani. Ma che porti quelli di 14 anni in prima squadra?\".\nSerie A\n[segui](#)",

Ezedi was convicted of a sexual assault in 2018 at Newcastle Crown Court and sources say he was given a suspended sentence for \"sexual assault/exposure.\" He was discharged from probation in 2020. Ezedi has not been apprehended and is considered a fugitive. Supt Gabriel Cameron from the police [told reporters](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/abdul-ezedi-fugitive-convicted-sex-32023662): \"We are now naming the man we want to speak to as Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, who is aged 35. We believe he travelled down from Newcastle earlier that day. We don’t know yet what led to it. We’re working to establish the circumstances. “A manhunt to trace Ezedi is under way. We are working with partner agencies and forces including the British Transport Police to locate and arrest him. If you see Ezedi, call 999 immediately. He should NOT be approached. He has significant injuries to the right side of the face. We will catch him. I am wholeheartedly confident... We will catch the male.\" One of his neighbors, Mohammad Hussain Nazary, also told reporters: \"I’d see him around the area and he’d come in from time to time. He’s an Afghan and I assumed he was single because I never saw him with a partner or family, he was always on his own. He seemed like an ordinary harmless guy, certainly not someone you’d associate with something like this. He was around quite a lot but I haven’t seen him in maybe six or seven months.\" The victims of the attack, a 3-year-old child and her mother, remain in the hospital with \"life-changing injuries.\" According to [witnesses](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13033379/Police-say-Clapham-chemical-attacker-Newcastle-area-continue-hunt-run-suspect-mother-two-young-children-doused-corrosive-substance.html), Ezedi appeared to slam the child to the ground repeatedly in the attack.

Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

    "text": "Eight players from Lancaster County schools have earned All-State honors from the Pennsylvania Volleyball Coaches Association for 2024. The four players honored from the Lancaster-Lebanon League were Hempfield’s Addison Leber and Bryce Calabretta, and Manheim Township’s Gracie Reinhart on the Class 4A team, and Lancaster Catholic’s Molly Wentz on the Class 2A team. From the CCAC, Linville Hill’s Desiree Smucker, Lyndi Esh and Kaley Higgins joined Ephrata Mennonite’s Joelle Burkholder on the Class 1A team. Leber, a senior outside hitter, earned her third All-State selection for L-L champion Hempfield, which won a sixth consecutive District Three title before reaching the PIAA semifinals for the second year in a row. Calabretta, an outside hitter, was one of just two freshmen to be named All-State. Reinhart, a senior opposite, helped the Blue Streaks reach the L-L final, the District Three semifinals and the PIAA Tournament for the first time since 2000. Wentz, a senior outside hitter, helped the Crusaders reach the District Three playoffs for the third straight season. Smucker, a senior outside hitter, and Esh, a senior libero, helped Linville Hill win its first District Three playoff match and first District Three title before surging all the way to the PIAA final. Higgins, a junior outside hitter, was the primary offensive threat for the Warriors. Burkholder, a junior middle hitter, helped Ephrata Mennonite reach the District Three final — where it lost to Linville Hill — as well as the PIAA Tournament for the first time in program history.",
