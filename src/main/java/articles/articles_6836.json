    "text": "On the morning of Wednesday, June 19, state police agents saved the lives of a person and their pet who were trapped in the middle of a fire that occurred in a home in Ciudad Cancel. Until now, officially, the causes of the fire are unknown, however, it was unofficially known that the incident could have been due to a short circuit. The fire started minutes before 8 in the morning in a house located on 77-B Street between 106 and 108 of the neighborhood, in the west of Mérida. The fire spread quickly through the house so that a man and his dog were trapped inside. The neighbors, who noticed the fire, called 911 and within minutes elements of the state police arrived and broke some window panes to carry out the rescue and save the lives of the man and his pet. Minutes later, firefighters arrived and fought the fire. Paramedics also arrived and took the person into an ambulance to treat him and, although he did not suffer physical injuries, he did have mild smoke poisoning. During the work, the police closed the street to prevent vehicle traffic and thus make the work more agile. TYT Newsroom",

For a community, that is rent, the groceries for the week, the difference between paying the utilities or not,\" Virginia Badillo, a Workers Defense Project board member, said during a press conference last year.\nThe group filed complaints with the U.S. Labor Department and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), alleging contractors and subcontractors gave some workers fake safety certificates.\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JULY 10, 1856, INVENTOR NIKOLA TESLA IS BORN: 'KEEN INTEREST IN NATURE'\n\"Workers report that when they needed training, they were simply sent PDF files or images of certificates through text or WhatsApp in a matter of days when there’s no conceivable way workers could have even taken the training required,\" Alexander told KXAN news.\nOriginal article source: Tesla robot goes haywire on engineer in Texas factory: 'Trail of blood'\nView comments",
