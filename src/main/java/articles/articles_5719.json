    "text": "FARGO, N.D. — A historic flood warning for the Red River in December may have weather watchers and the general public wondering what season we’re in.\nSelect river points are rising in the southern Red River basin due to excessive, unseasonable rainfall, which also contributed to a damaging ice storm over the past few days.\n“We believe this is the first,” said Carl Jones, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Grand Forks, about a flood warning in December.\nSince 2003, when the weather service there began its current format of flood warnings, it has not issued such a warning in December, he said.\nIt has issued multiple flood warnings outside of the spring and summer months, including September, October and November, and once in February of 2017.\nBut up until now, a flood warning had not been issued in December or in January.\nMost Red River Valley flooding happens in the spring from snow melt and occasionally in the summer from heavy rains or thunderstorms.\n“It’s very unusual in the heart of winter,” Jones added.\nJohn Wheeler, chief meteorologist at WDAY-TV, said the moisture alone was remarkable.\n“Two to 3 inches of rain on frozen ground in December is unprecedented in the record book,” he said.\nHowever, the resulting flooding predicted for Wahpeton and Fargo along the Red, as well as Abercrombie along the Wild Rice River, is expected to be minor.\nWith mitigation measures in place, Jones said the most people may see is pooling in low-lying areas meant to take on water.\nWhile 1 to 2½ inches of rain fell in the southern Red River Basin over the past few days, the total for the past seven days was upward of 3 inches.\nThe St. Croix River was also on the rise this week in Stillwater after the soggy Christmas week in the region.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the downtown river gauge was just above 77 feet. The river is expected to rise toward 80 feet next week.\nThat is the “action” stage for flood preparations in Stillwater. However, flood stage is 87 feet.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris: Abortion is more important than religious freedom",
    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris continued her campaign’s abortion extremism during an interview with NBC News’s Hallie Jackson on Tuesday. When asked about religious exemptions for abortion, Harris stated, “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body.” The Democratic nominee for president believes in forcing religious healthcare providers to perform abortions, a procedure that goes against many of their deeply held religious beliefs. It’s further proof a Harris administration would be authoritarian and infringe on religious rights while masquerading as freedom-loving and tolerant. Harris has been radically pro-abortion during her entire political career. Her history shows she is more than willing to target religious healthcare providers with punishment for not bowing to societal pressure. In 2018, then-Sen. Harris proposed and sponsored the Do No Harm Act . The legislation was in direct response to the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores and Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania cases, both of which received favorable Supreme Court rulings. In each, the high court allowed for religious exemptions within the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. At the time the Do No Harm bill was introduced, Harris was adamant: “That First Amendment guarantee [of religious freedom] should never be used to undermine other Americans’ civil rights or subject them to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity,” she said . Ironic, considering Harris wishes to undermine freedom and openly discriminate against religious healthcare organizations because they refuse to take the life of an unborn human being. It is hardly surprising that Catholic hospitals and other Catholic healthcare clinics would push back against government attempts to strong-arm them into performing abortions. The Catholic Church opposes the act of abortion. Allowing a religious exemption for Catholic hospitals and other faith-based medical organizations does not prohibit a woman from seeking an abortion elsewhere. The number of abortions in the United States has actually increased since 2020 . During her NBC interview, Harris repeated the claim that “a basic freedom has been taken from the women of America,” referencing the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. This is wholly false. While women in the U.S. have the freedom to secure abortion services at a variety of places, a Harris administration wishes to force religious providers to violate their core values. Harris has made abortion a cornerstone of her campaign since it began only three months ago. As a woman attempting to become the first female president, she presents herself as genuinely sympathetic when it concerns “reproductive rights.” But that concern only extends to women who find themselves with unwanted or unexpected pregnancies. And Harris’s only solution is to push abortion to get rid of the “problem” of a supposedly inconvenient life. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Without a doubt, religious exemptions should always exist for abortion and other reproductive-related issues such as contraception. As long as abortion is permitted in the U.S., there must be protections for those whose faith does not allow their participation in it. Harris says abortion “cannot be negotiable.” What really should be nonnegotiable is protecting our foundational freedoms. Harris is no friend to religious people, and she actively stood on the side of religious oppression while in Congress and during the last four years as vice president. Her desire to continue this anti-Americanism while in the Oval Office should greatly alarm voters, whether they’re personally religious or not.

    "text": "A Cork swimming club in Cork is appealing for help to get an Olympic-size pool built. Dolphin Swimming Club in Mayfield bought the pool worth €1.1 million from Birmingham City Council in the UK after it was used in the Commonwealth Games two years ago. It's hoped the six-lane Olympic-size pool earmarked for Glanmire will pave the way for more hopefuls eager to emulate [ the success of medallists Daniel Wiffin and Mona McSharry.](https://www.newstalk.com/news/olympics-daniel-wiffen-takes-gold-for-ireland-in-800-metre-freestyle-1750631) Dolphin Swim Club Chairman Club Guiseppe Whelan told [The Hard Shoulder](https://www.newstalk.com/shows/the-hard-shoulder-234864) it's an ongoing process. \"It arrived into Cork on May 10th this year on the back of four 40-foot trucks and it's been in storage since,\" he said. \"We've been in talks with Cork County Council and they very graciously offered five acres of land to us. \"We're in the process of looking to sign a lease on that and take it step-by-step to get this pool built\". 'Travel to Limerick' Mr Whelan said they've started a fundraising page to help pay for costs for the Olympic-size pool. \"We're looking to generate €100,000 for planning and design so we can actually get it to the next stage,\" he said. \"We have swimmers as young as 14 who are on the National Performance Pathway who have to leave their house at 4am and travel to Limerick and they don't get back into school until 10.30am. \"If we want swimmers of the standard of Mona McSharry or Daniel Wiffin coming out of Cork they need to have ready access to a swimming pool\". Mr Whelan said modular-based Olympic-size pools are the way to go. \"If anybody's paying attention to what's happening in Paris at the Olympic Games the swimming complex is inside a football stadium,\" he said. \"It's basically been put in place for the Olympic Games and will be dismantled after the Paralympic Games take place in a few weeks' time. \"This pool was a training pool, it's the full Olympic standard, and it wasn't being used after the Commonwealth Games. \"They came looking for a buyer and Swim Ireland contacted a number of clubs around the country\". 'It can get built very quickly' Mr Whelan said they looked to align with other clubs in the venture but it didn't happen. \"We managed to buy it, it's paid for and it's sitting in a warehouse in Cork,\" he said. \"You need a facility - the facility obviously costs a lot of money to build - and this pool then can get built very quickly inside this facility.\" Mr Whelan said they're looking at several avenues to get the Olympic-size pool built. \"There's this wonderful system that the Irish Government have which is Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Funding,\" he said. \"You can get up to €50m from that if you have the right project; that [funding] happens to open in June and close in July. \"We applied for it anyway but the timing wasn't right for us in the sense that you have to own the land or have a lease of the land. \"We're still in the process of going through that.\" Funding Mr Whelan said while Government funding is available they still need a chunk of around €3m. \"For the right project the Government will support 70% of funding,\" he said. \"So if we assume for a minute that the pool will cost us €10m, that means I need to have €3m cash in the bank. \"We're not in the position to do that\". Mr Whelan added that all swimming clubs in Cork have long waiting lists to help children to learn how to swim.

    "text": "AMAD DIALLO scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick to save Manchester United’s blushes in a 3-1 win against Premier League basement club Southampton on Thursday.\nRuben Amorim’s side looked set for a fourth straight league defeat at home before the forward turned the match on his head at a raucous Old Trafford.\nHe levelled in the 82nd minute before putting United ahead eight minutes later, rounding off in style with a third goal deep into stoppage time.\nIt was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history.\nIvan Juric’s team had deservedly taken the lead through Manuel Ugarte’s own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.\nUnited secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool.\nBut they had a point to prove to their long-suffering home fans after three straight Premier League defeats underlined the huge rebuilding task facing new manager Amorim.\nThe visitors settled quickly and the lively Kamaldeen Sulemana forced Andre Onana into a smart save after surging into the penalty area.\nDespite their slow start, the home side should have been ahead in the 20th minute following a flowing move down the left but Alejandro Garnacho skewed wide after being found by Rasmus Hojlund.\nSouthampton, who travelled to Old Trafford with only one league win all season, were playing with confidence and zip.\nOnana produced a brilliant double save to deny Tyler Dibling with an outstretched hand before quickly getting up to deny Mateus Fernandes from point-blank range.\nThe visitors scored the goal they thoroughly deserved in the 43rd minute after the United defence made a hash of a corner.\nMatheus Fernandes’s delivery was flicked on at the near post by Dibling and the ball went in off Ugarte’s back.\nAmorim raised eyebrows at half-time by bringing on the under-performing Antony for Kobbie Mainoo.\nGhana winger Sulemana, giving Leny Yoro a torrid time on the right side of United’s defence, burst through again, only to be denied by a block from the scrambling Matthijs de Ligt.\nAmorim then hauled off Ugarte and Hojlund, replaced by Toby Collyer and Joshua Zirkzee as he sent a stinging message to his under-performing stars.\nSulemana raced past Yoro again and sent a shot agonisingly wide of the post.\nAntony was responsible for an astonishing miss shortly before the hour mark, failing to get any purchase on a Garnacho cross.\nUnited were now building up a head of steam despite the lingering threat from Southampton.\nUnited finally got the breakthrough in the 82nd minute when Zirkzee spread the ball to Amad and he ran at the defence.\nHis first shot was blocked but he made no mistake with his second, blasting past Aaron Ramsdale in the Southampton goal.\nBut he was not finished yet.\nEight minutes later he got on the end of a cute dinked pass from substitute Christian Eriksen before taking advantage of a mistake from the Southampton defence to complete his hat-trick.\nThe win lifts United to 12th in the table and leaves Southampton 10 points from safety.\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter fired Brighton to their first Premier League win since November as they sank Ipswich 2-0 at Portman Road.\nMitoma scored his fourth goal of the season and Rutter hit his third in two matches as Fabian Hurzeler’s side climbed back into the top half of the table, having been winless in their previous eight league matches.\nIpswich had jumped out of the relegation zone without kicking a ball after Wolves’ heavy defeat at Newcastle on Wednesday night.\nBut they are back in it on goals scored after fluffing their lines at home again.\nKieran McKenna’s side picked up their first Portman Road win against Chelsea last time out, but they have amassed just four points from their other 10 home games this season.\nAdditional reporting by Press Association",

    "text": "Water rose as quickly as the rain fell, in Herkimer, Tuesday afternoon. Streets were almost instantly submerged. The force of all that water packed sewer pipes with gravel, branches and all kinds of debris, poured in through the street gutters.\n\"A couple inches in an hour is a lot,\" said Village DPW Superintendent, Justin Cristman. \"We just don't have the system to handle that all at once. It washed a lot of gravel down in pipes.\"\nThe Village DPW called it quits around 10:00 Tuesday night and was back at it around 5:30 Wednesday morning, with the industrial-strength equivalent of a Shop Vac.\n\"It's just sucking all the debris up to then let us...there's another machine down there called a jet machine, that's got high-pressure water that pulls... you start at the bottom and pull all the gravel down back to that machine through the pipes,\" said Superintendent Cristman.\nVillage and town DPW and highway crews were also out opening culverts. Because it's not just about cleaning up after this time, but getting ready for next time.\n\"Clean-up wise, street wise, it's not terrible. It's getting everything dug back, set up for the next event,\" said Superintendent Cristman.\nIt'll be a few more 12-hour days to get everything cleaned up and cleared out.",

    "text": "A masterpiece by Max Lanza in the Czech Republic, with a victory and a second place, puts him at the top of the Challenger Trophy at the end of the EuroNASCAR regular season. The Roman driver enters the Playoffs of the American-derived series with a solid 18-point lead, a useful margin to manage the last four double-points races effectively.\nOn the challenging track in the Czech Republic, the Roman driver secured a top position in the Challenger Trophy right from the first practice sessions, coming close to breaking into the overall Top 10 among the PRO multiple times. While qualifying resulted in a second-place finish in the category, it was during the race that the #88 Camaro truly shone. “ It was a phenomenal weekend and anything but ordinary! In Race 1, I felt great; we made a strong comeback and avoided any kind of trouble. My #88 was really fast, and the results proved it: overall Top 10 and victory in the Challenger Trophy!” commented Max Lanza, which had a long thrill in Race 2. “ …which I nearly didn’t finish! When we started the engine and were moving out for the formation lap after the autograph session, a rear driveshaft completely gave out, I managed to reach the end of the pit wall and parked, convinced that my race was over right there. However, the CAAL Racing guys made the most of the extra time provided by the red flag and I was able again to restart in the second start. Simply awesome! We came away with a second place and the lead in the standings in a race that we shouldn’t even have been able to participate in! “\n“Now it’s time to focus and think about the Semifinals in Oschersleben. Two races, double points, and no room for mistakes. If we’re smart and lucky, we might even be able to manage the points at the Finals in Zolder. For now, though, fingers crossed and full throttle. Today starts a new championship!”\nThe NASCAR Whelen Euro Series now moves to Germany, where the Semifinals will take place on the weekend of September 21 and 22.\nMax Lanza PR",
