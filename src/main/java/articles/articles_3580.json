    "title": "China says Taiwan ‘hyping up’ election interference claims",
    "text": "BEIJING: China’s defence ministry on Thursday accused Taiwan’s leadership of “hyping up” claims that Beijing is interfering in the self-ruled island’s upcoming presidential election. Taipei officials have repeatedly raised concerns about election interference and misinformation, and the January 13 vote comes during an escalating pressure campaign by Beijing, which claims the island as part of its territory.\nBut on Thursday Beijing said “the DPP authorities have been hyping up that China’s mainland is interfering in its elections”, using the initials of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party.\nDefence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told a press conference Taipei was trying to “stoke confrontation and manipulate the election”. Several Chinese balloons have been detected moving across the sensitive median line separating Taiwan from China throughout December, Taipei has said.\nAsked about the balloons on Thursday, Wu dismissed allegations of interference.\nTaipei’s claims, he said, were “all familiar pages from their old playbook” but “more and more people in Taiwan” saw through them.\nHis comments came the same day as a CNN report about popular Taiwanese band Mayday being pressured to make pro-China comments, citing Taipei security officials. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Councils — which handles cross-strait issues — accused Chinese authorities on Thursday of “forcing individuals from international cultural, performing arts and sports sectors... to express their political stance... in exchange for opportunities to perform or compete in China”.\n“This has been going on for many years,” the council said in a statement. “We believe that the band (Mayday) will not align with the (Chinese Communist Party) to let down the love and trust of Taiwanese youth.”\nOne of the main themes in the lead-up to the closely watched election is how the presidential candidates will handle relations with China.\nBoth campaign offices for DPP’s frontrunner candidate Lai Ching-te and opposition KMT’s Hou Yu-ih condemned the alleged election interference on Thursday.\n“China’s election interference behaviours continue to become more obvious, and even artists and bands are not spared,” said Lai’s campaign spokesman. Hou, whose KMT party has positioned itself as the one able to restart warmer relations with Beijing, has said Taiwan’s January 13 vote is a choice “between war and peace”.\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281018/china-says-taiwan-hyping-up-election-interference-claims\">China says Taiwan ‘hyping up’ election interference claims\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

The manager of Gita Press, Lalmani Tiwari, said that 'Ayodhya Darshan' includes a brief history of Ayodhya and highlights the significance of the pilgrimage through the topic entitled 'Ayodhya Mahatyam', along with other information about religious places like Hanuman Garhi and Hanuman Bagh. Tiwari emphasised that the life and sacrifice of Lord Ram reflect the true essence of Indian culture, recalling Mahatma Gandhi's call for Ram Rajya after Swaraj. Ayodhya darshan will also provide information about dharamshala hotels, trains and bus services from different cities to Ayodhya. Gita Press Gorakhpur’s publication, 'Ayodhya Darshan', will serve as a memory refresher for all ceremony attendees, Tiwari added. Tiwari said during the consecration ceremony, these books would be released by the President and distributed free among 8,000 invitees.

    "title": "Illegal migrants are sleeping in terminals of Boston airport on ‘daily basis’ as crisis overwhelms shelters",
    "text": "Dozens of illegal migrants are lining the floors of Terminal E at Boston Logan Airport with no light at the end of the tunnel as the crisis overwhelms the state’s shelter system.\n“We continue to see migrants at the airport on a daily basis,” Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan told the Boston Herald. “They come to Logan a number of ways — some fly in, but the majority do not. They also arrive at Logan at all hours.”\nPeople have been sleeping on the floors lining the lower level of international Terminal E, as shown in images captured by CBS News. Mehigan told the Boston Globe that Massport could not provide an estimate of how many people were sheltering in the terminal per day.\nMehigan told the Herald that the airport has provided staff who speak Haitian Creole and Spanish available to assist the people taking shelter in the airport. Logan reportedly coordinates with the state to transport people to “welcome centers,” which help direct incoming migrants to resources, services and transportation.\nBORDER BATTLE LINES: DEMS CALL ON BIDEN TO SEIZE CONTROL OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD, AS GOP ALLIES BACK ABBOTT\n“Frankly, what you’ve seen at Logan has been the situation, and this is why I said months ago that we are reaching capacity here,” Gov. Maura Healey said in response to questions at a press conference Monday.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe noted that “no incidents” have occurred involving the situation at the airport despite the volume of people. The governor said Logan has been a “wonderful partner” and thanked staff and state police — who she noted are working their regular shifts — for “managing the inflow and outflow of folks.”\nHealey said that her administration has processed nearly 3,000 work authorizations for people and opened overflow sites and other housing with community partners like United Way. But, she said, the state still needs help from the federal government because the crisis is “not a problem that Massachusetts created.”\nDEM GOVERNOR COMPLAINS AS MIGRANT SURGE STRAINS HER ‘RIGHT-TO-SHELTER’ STATE’S RESOURCES\nIllegal migrants line the floors of a terminal at Boston Logan Airport as Massachusetts shelters are overrun. WBZ\n“The bottom line here is that we really are reaching, have reached capacity,” Healey said. “I just continue to express in the strongest terms possible, that’s why we need action at the federal government. This is not a problem that Massachusetts created. However, it’s a problem that we’re having to deal with right now.”\nMassachusetts has a “right-to-shelter law,” which entitles migrant families to taxpayer-funded emergency shelter. The Bay State is the only one in the country with a statewide right-to-shelter law, signed into law in 1983 by Gov. Michael Dukakis.\nHealy, a Democrat, said in November that she had hoped the crisis wouldn’t devolve into homeless people sleeping at Boston’s Logan Airport or in emergency room.\nBOSTON ANNOUNCES REPARATIONS TASK FORCE THAT WILL STUDY IMPACT SLAVERY HAD ON RESIDENTS: CITY ‘ON TRIAL’\n“The bottom line here is that we really are reaching, have reached capacity,” Gov. Healey said. WBZ\nJust three months later, after she announced the state’s shelter system maxed out at 7,500 families, the situation has since devolved to that scenario.\nMassachusetts is on the brink. The migrant crisis comes as Texas is in a standoff with the Biden administration over what Gov. Greg Abbott says is its constitutional duty to protect itself against the “invasion” at the southern border.\nSeveral Republican governors on Wednesday night, including Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Brian Kemp of Georgia, announced they stood in solidarity with Abbott and the Lone Star State as the Biden administration insists that it defy Texas’ attempts to use razor wire to prevent illegals from crossing the border.\n“The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now,” Abbott said. “President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.”\nOriginal article source: Illegal migrants are sleeping in terminals of Boston airport on ‘daily basis’ as crisis overwhelms shelters",
