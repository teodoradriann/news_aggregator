    "title": "The Methodist Church of Great Britain Labels Terms 'Husband' and 'Wife' Offensive",
    "text": "The Methodist Church of Great Britain has called on its ministers, deacons, and elders to stop using offensive terminology such as “husband” and “wife” to avoid making assumptions that are not “the reality for many people.”\nThe church added the changes to its “Inclusive Language Guide,” an initiative aimed at preventing the use of “hurtful language” directed at groups the Methodist Church believes have been “marginalised and/or demonised by common culture.” The church plans to update the Inclusive Language Guide every six months to avoid using language that could offend groups it perceives as marginalized.\n. @MethodistGB brands terms 'husband' and 'wife' offensive.\nThis is not Christianity. It is Critical Theories: ‘smash heteronormativity.’\nIt is no longer enough to acknowledge disordered lifestyles. Everything normative and ordered must be demolished for fear of causing offence. pic.twitter.com/8OaUgMH6Nc\n— Fr Calvin Robinson (@calvinrobinson) December 28, 2023\nThe church wants its leaders to begin using terms such as “partner,” “child,” and “parent” as a way of recognizing that “relationships come in many varied expressions.”\nThe guidance specifically addressed the issue of gender identity as well, saying, “Using a person’s chosen pronouns is helpful as it honours their identity.” The church also cautioned followers against using “Language such as ‘brothers and sisters,’ while intended to be inclusive and friendly, doesn’t take into account our non-binary friends.”\nCongregants are also encouraged to use their pronouns when conversing in everyday life. And should their flock need any additional guidance when it comes to pronoun use or the latest approved language aimed at preventing offense to marginalized LGBT groups, the church directs its members to consult radical leftist groups such as GLAAD and Stonewall, the Christian Institute reports.\nThe radical language guidance from the governing body of Great Britain’s Methodist community follows even more radical actions from 2021 when the organization voted by an overwhelming margin to redefine marriage and officiate same-sex weddings.\nFather Krysztof Olaf Charamsa (L), who works for a Vatican office, gives a press conference with his partner Edouard to reveal his homosexuality on October 3, 2015, in Rome. (TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty Image)\nBiblical backing for the Methodist Church of Great Britain’s recent actions is nonexistent.\nUses of the terms “husband” and “wife” and guidance for their duties to each other and the family abound in the Bible. Such as in Ephesians 5: 33 (NIV) , which states, “However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.”\nThe Methodist Church also runs afoul of Biblical teachings on the issues of gender identity and same-sex marriage. Such as in Mark 10: 6-9(NIV) , which says, “ But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. ’So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”\n“Sam McBratney, Chairman of the pro-LGBT lobby group Dignity and Worth, confirmed that ministers in the denomination would still be able to preach faithfully on biblical sexual ethics,” the Christian Institute reports .\nIt remains to be seen how the Methodist Church plans to deal with those who may dare preach actual Biblical sexual ethics when the church’s governing body has already overruled the Bible.\nFaith London / Europe Christianity gender identity GLAAD Methodist Church same-sex marriage",

    "title": "Canada Women's National Team Coach Dismissed From Olympics Amid Drone Scandal",
    "text": "Canada Women's National Team Coach Dismissed From Olympics Amid Drone Scandal The Canadian Olympic Committee announced Thursday that it made the decision to dismiss women's national soccer team coach Bev Priestman from the Olympic squad. Priestman's dismissal comes on the heels of the ongoing scandal surrounding the [use of drones to spy on opponents](https://www.si.com/olympics/canadian-women-s-soccer-team-caught-spying-on-opponent-with-drone) from both the Canadian men's and women's squads. \"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the 2024 Paris Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement. \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent review.\" On Tuesday, two staff members from Canada's women's national soccer team were sent home from the Paris Olympics following an investigation into the alleged improper use of drones. Earlier this week, ahead of Canada's match against New Zealand, a drone was seen flying over the New Zealand squad's practice. The drone was reported to French authorities, who connected it to an analyst for Canada Soccer. The analyst, Joseph Lombardi, and assistant coach Jasmine Mander were sent home as a result. A report from [TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/canada-s-men-s-and-women-s-soccer-teams-have-relied-on-drones-and-spying-for-years-sources-say-1.2153674) on Thursday states that Canada has used drones for illegal espionage of opponents \"for years,\" including ahead of their run to Olympic gold at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. The women's team also was caught filming Panama's practice ahead of a World Cup qualifying matchup in 2022, which prompted the Panamanian Football Federation to file a complaint to Canada Soccer and CONCACAF. \"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" Priestman in a statement Wednesday, one day prior to her dismissal. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\" Priestman has been head coach of Canada's women's national team since 2020. She's married to Emma Humphries, a former New Zealand women's national soccer team midfielder. Assistant coach Andy Spence will serve in her place as coach for the Olympic Games as the investigation into Priestman carries on.",

    "text": "The World's Five Most Breathtaking Long Distance Hikes Hiking the American or global wilderness is a pastime for those who have a passion for the outdoors, but long distance hiking is an entirely different ballgame and a major activity in itself. Rather than making a picturesque hike a day long activity that is just a feature of a trip, adventure seekers who are looking for long distance hikes find trails that can take days, weeks, or even months to complete. Long distance hiking is certainly not for the faint of heart and some of these trails would push even the most experienced hikers to the brink. Here are five of the most breathtaking long distance hikes on the planet: 1. The Continental Divide Trail The [Continental Divide](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/trails/cdt) spans a jaw-dropping 3,100 miles, the longest and most challenging of the three classic American thru-hikes. Beginning right on the edge of Mexico and New Mexico, it spans all the way through the Rocky Mountains up to Canada as hikers go from desert to mountains. Hikers who want to to accomplish this beast will have to plan accordingly to avoid weather that is too hot to the South and too cold to the North. 2. Snowman Trek Located in the Kingdom of Bhutan, a small country in the south of Asia, the [Snowman Trek](https://worldexpeditions.com/Bhutan/Exploratory-Treks/Bhutan-Snowman-Trek) is a 216 mile masterpiece which was created by the yak herders and goes through villages and mountains, and some hikers have even reported seeing snow leopards on the trail. In 2022, the trail was run as an ultra marathon by 29 participants, which almost half of did not finish due to altitude sickness. 3. John Muir Trail The [John Muir Trail](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/john-muir-trail/) is one of the prettiest in all of America, spanning 211 miles in the Sierra Nevada Mountain range in California from the Yosemite Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney. It's known for its elevation, with the lowest point on the trail still above 4,000 feet. 4. Wales Coast Path Compared to the others, the [Wales Coast Path](https://www.walescoastpath.gov.uk/?lang=en) is relatively new, launched just in 2012. Spanning 870 miles down the entire coast, it's the only dedicated coast path in the world that spans an entire length of a country. Hikers can try the whole thing or split it up into sections. 5. The Via Alpina The grandest trail in all of the European Alps, the [Via Alpina](https://www.via-alpina.org/) stretches different trails throughout the continent that span over 3,000 miles. The 'Red Route' starts in Monaco and goes through all eight Alpine countries, finishing on Italy's Adriatic Coast. Doing the entire hike while the mountains are passable in one shot is impossible, but many take years to take in the whole thing in stages.",

    "text": "Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany, said this in an interview with Ukrinform. \"Despite the current very difficult situation, Ukraine remains an interesting market for many companies,\" Schulze said. She explained that the production process can still be carried out in a significant part of the country, and the fact that Ukraine is a candidate for EU membership is a \"long-term\" argument for companies. [About 1,500 participants invited to Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin](/rubric-vidbudova/3860026-about-1500-participants-invited-to-ukraine-recovery-conference-in-berlin.html) The minister cited data from the German-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicating that before the full-scale Russian invasion, about 2,000 companies with German capital were operating in Ukraine. \"Even after the Russian invasion, there were almost no companies that would completely halt their activities in Ukraine. They 'keep their foot in the door' because they know it's worth it,\" Schulze said. At the same time, she noted that the private sector needs a positive investment climate and legal certainty. Therefore, Germany supports Ukraine on its reform path, especially with regard to the process of joining the EU. The fight against corruption is especially important, Schulze said. She mentioned a Transparency International report that noted progress in this matter, despite the fact that Russian aggression is ongoing. This is a very positive signal for the economy, Schulze said.",

Some private companies in Australia are already testing the waters with Bunnings earlier this year telling its 40,000 employees they could condense their weeks and Medibank announcing in October they would let 250 staff try it for six months. While the pilot program will only involve government workers, Mr Barr has said if it was successful it could have a wider effect on all businesses in the ACT. 'My view is if we're going to do this, it's for everyone,' Mr Barr said. 'If we're fair dinkum about discussions for four days, then it needs to be four days across the [entire] system. 'We can't have our cake and eat it too.' The ACT government will test four-day work weeks for its employees with chief minister Andrew Barr (pictured) saying it could spread to the whole economy The ACT government confirmed the four-day work week trial in response to a September report from the Standing Committee on Economy and Gender and Economic Equality. The committee was investigating which model of a shorter work week would be most successful. Options such as a 'compressed' model in which workers do the normal 40 hours over four longer days, a 'reduction' model in which hours are reduced but productivity is expected to be increased, and a 'hybrid' model were all on the table. The committee recommended the reduction model with 'a shift to a four-day work week being considered full time employment' and acknowledging that would bring with it widespread 'societal repercussions'. Private companies are already testing the waters with both Medibank and Bunnings allowing workers to do four-day weeks to test their productivity While it has agreed to the trial the ACT government said it was still wary of the challenges. 'A trial within the ACTPS [ACT Public Service] will test the reduction model of the four-day work week where there is no loss of pay or conditions for ACTPS employees,' the ACT government said in a statement. 'While productivity may increase, it may not increase sufficiently or with enough longevity to fund the model in the longer term,' the statement continued. 'Further, staffing in many frontline areas will most likely have to increase to ensure adequate roster cover and ensure service delivery is maintained.'",

    "text": "Visitors watch a firework show during the opening ceremony of the 40th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival at the Harbin Ice-Snow World in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Jan. 5, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)\nHARBIN, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Though the temperature had dropped below minus 20 degrees Celsius, thousands of tourists were still lingering outdoors in the winter wonderland of Harbin Ice-Snow World located in the city of Harbin in China's northernmost Heilongjiang Province.\n\"We came here as soon as we arrived in Harbin. This venue is going viral on social media this winter!\" said Sun Xiaozheng, a tourist from Beijing visiting the \"ice city\" with her friend.\nEven though their hands were already numb due to the freezing cold, Sun said the splendid ice sculptures and illuminations fascinated her and her friend to such an extent that they decided to keep wandering around in the park in search of more surprises, despite the very low temperature.\nBuilt on the bank of the frozen Songhua River, Harbin Ice-Snow World is a landmark ice-and-snow theme park carved out of 250,000 cubic meters of ice and snow.\nThe park, alongside other winter attractions in northeast China, has recently proved a smash hit on Chinese social media. This has especially been the case since the International Ice and Snow Festival kicked off on Jan. 5 in Harbin, with the park seeing a huge and steady influx of people over the past week.\nAn aerial drone photo taken on Jan. 5, 2024 shows tourists having fun at the Harbin Ice-Snow World in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)\nLuo Xin, vice president of Harbin Ice and Snow World Park Co., Ltd., the theme park's operator, said the park has seen a significant increase in visitors compared with past years, receiving an average of more than 30,000 visitors daily this winter.\nAs tourism continues to heat up in Harbin, the park is drawing an increasing number of tourists by offering various winter activities and experiences, along with heart-warming service, thereby providing people with memorable welcomes.\nAccording to Sun Zemin, marketing director of the park, this year's scale of ice-and-snow sculptures in the park is the largest since it first opened in 1999. This winter the park features a series of giant ice sculptures and more than 20 amusement activities, ranging from ice kart racing to snow drifting.\nTo cope with the growing demands of tourists, the number of ice slides in the park has been expanded from eight last winter to 14 this winter, with operating time also extended, said Sun.\n\"Our staff at the ice slides often work until 1 or even 2 a.m. to make sure that every tourist queuing in line gets a chance to experience it,\" Sun added.\nTourists enjoy rides on an ice slide at Harbin Ice-Snow World in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Jan. 2, 2024. (Xinhua/Xie Jianfei)\n\"People start waiting in front of the park gate at 8 a.m. daily, and they come from various regions including the likes of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. During the upcoming Spring Festival, we will experience the peak tourist flow,\" said Zhang Meiling, a tour guide at the park.\nIn the park, many volunteers dressed in light-colored down coats and red vests serve as the jacks-of-all-trades for tourists in need, offering route guidance, lost and found services, and even a cup of hot ginger tea.\nAn undergraduate at Harbin University of Science and Technology surnamed Yu is among the volunteers providing hot tea for tourists in queues. \"Although I have to stay outdoors, the enthusiasm of tourists brings warmth to my heart, making my experience unforgettable,\" he said.\nSuch hospitality has helped both the park and the city of Harbin gain the goodwill of tourists from all over the country, and on Chinese social media many people have shared their impressive experiences in the city, such as finding free smartphone charging areas in subway stations, or receiving free rides from local drivers. These tourists voluntarily became spokespersons for Harbin's travel industry, drawing even more nationwide attention to the city.\n\"Followers of my social media accounts soared from 600,000 to more than 2 million recently, with an online audience of over 100,000 watching my live broadcasts. It's such an extraordinary experience in my career,\" said Teng Yue, a host working at the park, while also expressing his wishes to deliver joy to tourists.\nGiven the variety of activities and cordial services on offer in Heilongjiang, it is easy to understand why the passion of tourists is extending beyond the walls of Harbin Ice-Snow World. Many other winter attractions in this province have also seen a surge in visitors this winter.\nThis photo taken on Dec. 14, 2022 shows a view of the Snow Town scenic spot in Hailin City in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. (Xinhua/Xie Jianfei)\nAs of Thursday, Yabuli, a renowned ski resort in Harbin, had received a total of 410,000 tourists this season, with the highest single-day tourist number topping 14,000. The \"Snow Town\" in the city of Mudanjiang, with its stunning snow views, has entertained more than 720,000 guests since opening in early November 2023, and tourist numbers there also expected to break records this winter.\n\"This year the number of tourists has increased significantly. Currently, even rooms for the upcoming Spring Festival have nearly all been booked out,\" said Fan Zhaoyi, a homestay manager in Mudanjiang.\n\"For individual travelers, a city's infrastructure and public services form the backbone of tourism competitiveness. It is only when tourists feel the warmth of the city and the goodwill of its citizens that they blend into the lives of a travel destination,\" said Dai Bin, president of China Tourism Academy. ■",
