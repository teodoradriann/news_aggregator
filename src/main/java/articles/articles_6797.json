    "title": "Northern lights forecast upgraded to ‘severe,’ could dazzle Upstate NY tonight (or tomorrow)",
    "text": "If you’ve been seeing amazing [aurora borealis photos](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/05/upstate-ny-captivated-by-stunning-northern-lights-display-photos-videos.html) taken across Upstate New York and want to catch a glimpse yourself, you might get another chance tonight — or tomorrow. A severe geomagnetic storm alert has been issued for Oct. 10 and 11 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. The daily aurora forecast is predicting there could be colorful skies across most of Upstate New York during the event. The NOAA says the possible G4 storm caused by a large solar flare could be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California tonight if the skies are clear. Tonight’s event is forecast to have a Kp index of 8 which means the aurora will move even further towards the equator and it will become very bright and very active. The NOAA reports these are the events that create the best aurora and the extended auroral oval will be observable by the most people. Residents in the [United Kingdom](https://x.com/physicsJ/status/1844457718310109652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), near London, have already posted photos of aurora-filled skies to social media. New York has had several chances this year to see beautiful night rainbow skies including May, [August](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/08/awesome-aurora-see-epic-photos-of-northern-lights-in-upstate-ny.html), [September](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2024/09/aurora-awestruck-northern-lights-dance-above-upstate-ny-photos-video.html) and earlier this [October](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/10/will-the-aurora-borealis-appear-above-upstate-ny-this-week-we-like-our-chances.html). Where is the best place to see the northern lights? Head into the darkness if you want the best chance to see the neon skies. Avoid as much light pollution as possible and find a clear view of the horizon facing north. Popular spots include dark sky territory like the [Adirondacks](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/adirondacks/) and clear horizons like Lake Ontario or [Northern New York](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/northern-ny/) bordering Lake Champlain. When will the northern lights appear? Predicting when and where the lights will be visible is not an easy task. The NOAA says the best aurora is usually within an hour or two of midnight, between 10 PM and 2 AM local time, but can appear any time after sunset or sunrise. For an updated aurora forecast, visit [NOAA’s website](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) or the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NWSSWPC) for the Space Weather Prediction Center. How can I photograph the northern lights? You don’t need an expensive camera to capture the auroras. [Visit Iceland](https://www.visiticeland.com/article/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights-with-a-smartphone), a popular northern lights viewing destination, offers tips to capturing the event with your smartphone. They suggest putting your phone in night mode and adjusting the exposure time if possible to 10-15 seconds to fully capture the sky. A tripod is also helpful to keep your phone steady and your lens in focus. If the northern lights appear tonight, we would love to see your photos. Please send your captures to [features@nyup.com](mailto:features@nyup.com) and make sure to include your name and where the photos were taken.",

    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is set to virtually lay the foundation stone for a 300 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan today, according to an official statement from the Ministry of Coal. The project, funded with an investment exceeding Rs 1,756 crore, aims to provide affordable power to government entities. NLC India Limited, a leading Navratna CPSE under the Ministry of Coal, is spearheading the initiative in Barsingsar, Bikaner district, as part of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy’s CPSE Scheme.\nThe solar project incorporates advanced technology, including high-efficiency bifacial modules made in India, aligning with Prime Minister Modi’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative. The generated electricity will be transmitted through existing power lines of Barsingsar Thermal Power Station, with an annual target of producing approximately 750 million units of green power. This is expected to offset carbon dioxide emissions by around 18,000 million metric tonnes over its lifetime.\nThe power usage agreement for the project has been finalized with Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited at a competitive tariff of Rs 2.52 per unit for the next 25 years. The project is scheduled for commissioning by September 2024, with potential employment opportunities for about 600 individuals during the project phase and 100 personnel during the operations and maintenance phase.\nThe official statement emphasizes that the project will assist Rajasthan in meeting its renewable purchase obligation while contributing to the nation’s journey towards achieving a net-zero future. NLCIL, operating the 250 MW Barsingsar Thermal Power Station (BTPS), has obtained a 300 MW solar project capacity through competitive bidding in the CPSE Scheme Phase-II Tranche-III facilitated by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).",

    "text": "After a cold and foggy start to the morning, we’re on track to see a bright and beautiful day to kick off the new year. Temperatures will warm up quickly through the morning, with daytime highs landing at 70 degrees this afternoon. The low humidity and sunshine will make for a picture-perfect day if you have any New Year’s Day outdoor plans. If you’re taking the boat out, the wind won’t be much of a factor. Seas will run between 1-2 feet, and inland waters will stay smooth. Expect another night of chilly weather tonight, but it won’t be as cold as the last couple of nights. We’ll wake up Tuesday morning to temperatures in the mid-50s for most of Southwest Florida. We’ll see lots of ups and downs in our temperatures this week, thanks to three cold fronts moving through our area. The first front moves through Tuesday, bringing us a reinforcing shot of cool air but not much rain. The second front moves through Thursday, and the third cold front moves through this weekend. The weekend front will provide us with our best rain chances this week, and we’ll also see some rather windy weather to start the first weekend of 2024.",
