    "text": "[Gran Hermano: qué participantes siguen en placa tras el voto positivo del públicoOpens in new window ]\nLuego del ingreso de los nuevos participantes, la casa de Gran Hermano se ve revoloteada y, este jueves, durante la actividad de la tarde, Lucía sufrió un tremendo golpe de Lorenzo que la dejó tumbada en el piso.\nMirá También: Se supo por qué Mauro Icardi no pudo ver a sus hijas el día de su cumpleaños y estalló el conflicto judicial con Wanda Nara\nMientras disfrutaba de la actividad dentro de la casa más famosa del mundo junto a sus compañeros, la joven concursante sufrió un fuerte accidente que quedó grabado por las cámaras del ciclo.\nDurante un juego y mientras las cámaras que graban 24/7 las enfocaban, Lorenzo chocó de frente a Lucía a toda velocidad y la joven quedó tumbada en el suelo con mucho dolor en su rodilla.\nEl robo que sufrió Selva en Gran Hermano\nSi bien las toallas y sábanas pueden ser reemplazadas por la producción del reality de la casa más famosa del país, la comida es un problema cotidiano entre los competidores de Gran Hermano.\nPor este motivo, es que los robos y hurto de comida suelen ocasaionar las peleas más fuertes de la competencia y, en esta oportunidad, Selva vivió en carne propia lo que se siente.\n“Había dos (ananás) y te afanaron la tuya“, esbozó con humor Lucía. A lo que Selva continuó diciendo: ”Yo la hubiera compartido igual. Yo ahora me estoy secando con una bata que no es mía porque la mía desapareció“.\nDe todos modos, la participante aseguró que, cuando salga de Gran Hermano, le pedirá a “Big” que le muestre el tape del robo. “Me voy a reír como loca”, cerróla jugadora.\nMirá También: “Estoy para vos”, el letal encuentro entre Wanda Nara con su ex guardaespaldas que dejó a L-Gante en la peor situación\nConmoción total en Gran Hermano por un difícil cuadro de salud que sacudió el juego para siempre\nSusana Roccassalvo analizó la competencia de la casa más famosa y aseguró que “le falta una Furia a Gran Hermano”.\n“Tenía un aneurisma”, conmoción total en Gran Hermano por un difícil cuadro de salud que sacudió el juego para siempre\n“Yo le pregunté a gente de Telefe y me dicen que no están bien. Salió una chica que tenía personalidad, generaba, es Andrea Lázaro”, reveló la periodista.\n“La tuvieron que sacar por una cuestión de salud. La sacaron por un aneurisma cerebral. Ella lo tuvo anteriormente y ahora estaba con dolores”, dijo sobre la ex Gran Hermano.\nY agregó: \"Salió por precaución. Lo cierto es que están metiendo mucha mano porque no es el rating que ellos esperaban. Ya cansó el formato y Santiago del Moro se nota un poco molesto porque siempre los pincha y les dice ‘no son plantas’“.\nEn este sentido, también sostuvo que le “parece que era innecesario después de unos meses de que terminara el otro Gran Hermano. Comerse todo un verano donde bajan muchísimo las mediciones”, expresó Roccassalvo.",

    "text": "Stargazing New Englanders who missed the dazzling display of pink and green northern lights this week may get another shot to see them on Friday night.\nThe northern lights made a rare appearance further south than usual on Sunday and again on Thursday, thanks to a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused vibrant aurora borealis.\nAccording to the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), that solar storm has since subsided from a G4 to a G3. While the storm’s effects continue to diminish, Friday’s clear evening forecast means it’s still possible to catch a glimpse of the northern lights.\nA G3 Watch remains in effect for 11 Oct as CME effects continue to diminish. A G1 Watch is in place for 12 Oct due to lingering effects.

The lights don’t need to be directly overhead to be seen, but if the aurora is bright and conditions are right, they can be observed from as far away as 1,000 kilometers.\nBoston.com Today Sign up to receive the latest headlines in your inbox each morning.\nSubmit your email Enter your email address\nSign up",

    "title": "The Essentials of Medical Tourism: An Introductory Overview",
    "text": "In the realm of global healthcare, medical tourism has emerged as a transformative force, offering individuals a world of opportunities to access quality medical care, wellness treatments, and specialized procedures beyond their home borders. This introductory overview aims to illuminate the essence of medical tourism, exploring its myriad benefits, popular procedures, key considerations, and the evolving landscape of healthcare destinations. Tailored for industry professionals and discerning individuals, this comprehensive examination seeks to empower readers with the knowledge needed to navigate the realm of medical tourism confidently.\nUnderstanding Medical Tourism: A Global Perspective\nMedical tourism, also known as health tourism or medical travel, refers to the practice of traveling to a different country or region to seek medical treatment, wellness services, or elective procedures. While the concept of seeking healthcare abroad is not new, the modern phenomenon of medical tourism has gained momentum in recent years, driven by factors such as rising healthcare costs, long waiting times for procedures, advancements in medical technology, and increased accessibility to international travel.\nThe Evolution of Medical Tourism\nHistorically, medical tourism was predominantly a one-way flow from less developed to more developed countries, with individuals seeking advanced medical treatments and specialized procedures unavailable in their home countries. However, the landscape has shifted to encompass a global exchange of healthcare services, with individuals from developed nations also traveling to emerging healthcare hubs in search of cost-effective and high-quality medical care.\nBenefits of Medical Tourism\nThe allure of medical tourism lies in its multifaceted benefits, which extend far beyond mere access to medical treatment. Among the primary advantages are:\nCost-Effectiveness\nOne of the most significant draws of medical tourism is the potential for substantial cost savings compared to healthcare expenses in the traveler's home country. In destinations like Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, medical procedures can often be performed at a fraction of the cost without compromising on quality or safety standards.\nAccess to Specialized Procedures\nMedical tourism opens doors to a broader range of medical services and specialized procedures, including elective surgeries, cosmetic enhancements, fertility treatments, organ transplants, and advanced medical interventions. Patients can access treatments that may not be readily available or affordable in their home countries, thereby expanding their healthcare options.\nReduced Waiting Times\nIn many countries with publicly funded healthcare systems, long waiting times for medical procedures can be a significant deterrent. Medical tourism offers a solution by providing expedited access to treatment, enabling patients to schedule procedures promptly and avoid prolonged waiting lists.\nQuality Healthcare Facilities\nLeading medical tourism destinations boast state-of-the-art healthcare facilities equipped with advanced medical technology, internationally accredited hospitals, and highly skilled healthcare professionals. Patients can expect world-class treatment in modern, comfortable environments conducive to healing and recovery.\nCombining Healthcare with Leisure\nMedical tourism transcends traditional healthcare experiences by offering the opportunity to combine medical treatment with leisure, relaxation, and tourism. Many medical tourists choose destinations known for their scenic beauty, cultural attractions, and wellness retreats, allowing them to rejuvenate both body and mind during their recovery period.\nPopular Procedures and Treatments\nMedical tourism encompasses a wide range of procedures and treatments tailored to the diverse needs and preferences of patients. Some of the most sought-after medical services include:\nCosmetic Surgery and Aesthetic Procedures\nCosmetic enhancements such as facelifts, breast augmentation, liposuction, and rhinoplasty are popular among medical tourists seeking to improve their appearance and boost self-confidence. Destinations like Brazil, Thailand, and South Korea are renowned for their expertise in cosmetic surgery.\nDental Tourism\nDental procedures, including dental implants, crowns, veneers, and teeth whitening, attract patients seeking high-quality dental care at affordable prices. Countries like Mexico, Hungary, and Costa Rica are favored destinations for dental tourism due to their skilled dentists and modern dental clinics.\nOrthopedic Surgeries\nOrthopedic procedures such as knee replacements, hip replacements, and spinal surgeries are commonly sought by medical tourists seeking relief from musculoskeletal conditions and injuries. Countries like India, Singapore, and Germany are renowned for their orthopedic expertise and specialized treatment centers.\nFertility Treatments\nFertility clinics offering in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg freezing, and surrogacy services cater to couples struggling with infertility issues. Destinations like Spain, Greece, and the Czech Republic are popular choices for fertility tourism due to their advanced reproductive technologies and supportive legal frameworks.\nWellness and Alternative Medicine\nWellness retreats offering holistic treatments such as yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, and traditional Chinese medicine appeal to individuals seeking to enhance their overall well-being and restore balance to mind, body, and spirit. Destinations like India, Thailand, and Bali are renowned for their wellness tourism offerings.\nKey Considerations for Medical Tourism\nWhile medical tourism offers numerous benefits, it is essential for prospective patients to approach the process with careful consideration and thorough research. Some key factors to keep in mind include:\nAccreditation and Quality Standards\nChoose healthcare facilities that adhere to international quality standards and are accredited by reputable organizations such as the Joint Commission International (JCI) or the International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua). Accreditation ensures that hospitals and clinics meet stringent criteria for patient safety, quality of care, and clinical outcomes.\nHealthcare Providers and Specialists\nResearch the qualifications, experience, and reputation of healthcare providers, surgeons, and specialists who will be overseeing your treatment. Look for board-certified physicians with expertise in your specific medical condition or procedure, and seek recommendations from trusted sources or patient reviews.\nLanguage and Communication\nEnsure that language barriers will not hinder effective communication between you and your healthcare providers. Choose destinations where medical staff are proficient in your native language or where interpretation services are readily available to facilitate clear communication throughout your medical journey.\nTravel Logistics and Support Services\nConsider logistical factors such as travel arrangements, visa requirements, accommodation options, and transportation to and from medical appointments. Many medical tourism facilitators offer comprehensive travel packages that include assistance with travel logistics, airport transfers, and accommodation arrangements to streamline the process for patients.\nAftercare and Follow-Up Support\nEvaluate the availability of post-treatment care, follow-up consultations, and support services to ensure continuity of care after returning home. Choose healthcare providers that offer comprehensive aftercare packages, including remote monitoring, telemedicine consultations, and access to medical records for ongoing support and follow-up.\nConclusion\nAs the global healthcare landscape continues to evolve, medical tourism presents a compelling alternative for individuals seeking quality medical care, specialized treatments, and wellness experiences beyond their home borders. By understanding the essentials of medical tourism and considering key factors such as cost-effectiveness, quality standards, and patient support services, industry professionals and patients alike can make informed decisions and embark on a journey toward improved health, well-being, and vitality. With careful planning, research, and guidance from trusted healthcare providers, medical tourism offers a pathway to wellness that is as rewarding as it is transformative.\n Global\n ",

    "text": "In certe zone del Mediterraneo il livello del mare sta salendo a velocità tripla rispetto alle stime fatte finora: oltre 38.500 chilometri quadrati di coste saranno presto a rischio inondazione. Lo indica lo studio firmato da tre ricercatori italiani delle sedi di Roma e Bologna dell'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia e dell'Università olandese di Radboud, pubblicato sulla rivista Environmental Research Letters. Per l'Italia, le coste più a rischio sono quelle di Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna e Puglia settentrionale per il versante adriatico, insieme a quelle di Toscana, Lazio e in parte della Sardegna per quello tirrenico.\nLa causa di questa modifica al rialzo delle proiezioni sull'aumento del livello del mare sta nel fenomeno della subsidenza. \"La subsidenza, cioè il lento movimento verso il basso del suolo dovuto a cause naturali o antropiche, ha un ruolo cruciale nell'accelerare l'aumento del livello del mare lungo le coste, innescato dal riscaldamento globale a partire dal 1880\", osserva Marco Anzidei, dell'Ingv, dello studio con Antonio Vecchio ed Enrico Serpelloni.\n\"Le nostre analisi mostrano che, proprio a causa della subsidenza, in alcune zone del Mediterraneo il livello del mare sta aumentando a una velocità quasi tripla rispetto alle zone stabili\", aggiunge Vecchio dell'Università di Radboud e primo autore della ricerca.\nNella ricerca, osserva Serpelloni, sono stati utilizzati i dati dei sistemi di navigazione satellitare, che permettono di calcolare in maniera estremamente precisa le velocità di spostamento verticale del suolo. Alla luce di questi dati, i tre ricercatori hanno ricalcolato le attuali proiezioni fino al 2150 in 265 zone del Mediterraneo. \"Nelle aree risultate più a rischio ci saranno maggiori impatti sull'ambiente, sulle attività umane e sulle infrastrutture\", dice Anzidei: \"È quindi necessario - conclude - intraprendere azioni concrete a sostegno delle popolazioni costiere\".\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "title": "Sims 3 crashing on launch with no error message - Answer HQ",
    "text": "I recently upgraded to a new pc and installed the Sims 3 with all its DLC back in the fall (I forget the exact time frame) and initially had no issues whatsoever running the game. Just within the last few weeks however I've been attempting to run the game only for it to crash when I hit play in the launcher with no accompanying error message. I've applied the Alder Lake patch and attempted to use the Powershell method (granted I'm not entirely certain I did so correctly) and have both repaired and reinstalled the game multiple times with no success. I'm at my wit's end as up until fairly recently I've had no issues with the game. I last played it successfully back in late October/early November (if I recall correctly) and only encountered this issue within the last week or so. I have enclosed for the benefit of ourselves the dxdiag report as well as the error log(s). Let me know if any additional information is needed or if what I've provided here is not what was needed. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.",

    "title": "Buying a home? Major bank warns over rise in scam which sees fraudsters steal deposits",
    "text": "Home buyers are being warned by Lloyds Bank to be vigilant over the rise of a scam which could cost them their entire deposit - with first-time buyers particularly vulnerable. Conveyancing scams have increased 29 per cent over the past year, with fraudsters hacking email accounts of home buyers to con them out of their deposit payments. Victims have an average of £47,527 stolen by scammers, analysis from Lloyds shows, but in some cases criminals have stolen more than £250,000. While conveyancing scams are far less common than other types of fraud, the bank says the average amount stolen by opportunist scammers is by far the highest - and have dubbed it Britain&#039;s &#039;costliest scam&#039;. Verification: House buyers should meet their solicitor in person in order to verify their payment details Reaching well into the tens of thousands, the average conveyancing scam dwarfs investment scams, which lose victims an average of £9,037, and romance scams which see an average of £6,340 stolen by fraudsters. Conveyancing scams begin with the email address of a home buyer or a solicitor being hacked, after which point scammers will follow emails relating to a property purchase. From there, they choose their moment to send false payment details to the buyer, that appear to be from the solicitor&#039;s email address. In some cases, this could be from the solicitor&#039;s actual address, but in most instances fraudsters will spoof an address, using the names, logos and signatures that they have already seen in the earlier email exchanges. They may even call you, impersonating the solicitor&#039;s firm. The scam has been around for years and plays on victims being in a rush - and stressed - in getting such a large sum of money over to secure their new home. Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds, said: &#039;Buying a new home is one of the most exciting moments many of us will ever experience. &#039;But it can also be incredibly stressful, given the amount of money involved, and the need to navigate a complex legal process. &#039;While the financial consequences of these scams are severe, the emotional toll can be even greater. &#039;The fraud often leads to the collapse of a property transaction, with a devastating long-term impact on those involved.&#039; The bank said almost half, 45 per cent, of the victims who reported the scam were under the age of 39, meaning that scammers could be targeting first time buyers due to their lack of experience with the homebuying process. Chloe, whose name has been changed, was one such first time buyer who was scammed out of £5,000 when she tried to transfer her deposit for a £195,000 two-bed flat in Birmingham. Read More Meet the scambaiters beating fraudsters at their own game... by wasting THEIR time and money Chloe was waiting for her solicitor to send her details for transferring her deposit, so when she received an email with invoice and payment instructions a few days later, she thought little of it. While she paid the first instalment of her deposit to the fraudster, luckily for Chloe, the second £5,000 payment she tried to make was blocked by her bank, which then spoke to Chloe and told her to contact her solicitor&#039;s trusted phone number. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. &#039;Fraudsters prey on weaknesses in email security and exploit a conveyancing process that most people may only experience a handful of times in their lives,&#039; Ziegler said. &#039;It&#039;s vital that solicitors also grasp the importance of educating their clients on the risk of this type of scam and make a point of sharing payment details in person at the start of the homebuying process.&#039; THIS IS MONEY PODCAST",

    "title": "A huge tornado on the sun released a cloud of hot gas 6 times the size of the Earth",
    "text": "- A tornado on the sun released a cloud of hot gas about six times the size of the Earth into space.\n- The cloud was released alongside a powerful coronal mass ejection.\n- The sun has been fizzing with activity as it nears its most restless state in more than a decade.\nNASA captured an enormous tornado on the sun's surface that released a cloud of hot charged gas about six times the size of the Earth.\nThe gas cloud was spotted by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory on Thursday.\nIt was accompanied by a powerful coronal mass ejection, an explosion that sends charged particles barreling through space, per space weather website\nspaceweather.com.\nThe cloud of gas was not launched toward Earth, so isn't dangerous for humans. Still, it is a symptom of the\nsun's current state of restlessness, which is increasing as it nears a peak of activity.\nEvery twelve years or so, the sun's poles flip. This causes our star to fizz with more solar explosions,\nsunspots, flares, and storms than when it is quiet. Eventually, the sun reaches a peak of activity and starts settling down again.\nScientists predict this\npeak should happen within the next year or so. In the meantime, they are keeping a close eye.\nSolar weather is mostly harmless for humans, but a peak of solar activity increases the risk of a very rare,\nonce-in-a-lifetime solar storm so powerful it could short power grids and knock out communication systems.\nSolar observation systems are currently poorly equipped to predict such a storm, which could be felt on Earth very quickly.\nThe increased solar activity could also put deep-space astronauts at more risk being exposed to radiation, a major hindrance at a time when space agencies aim to send astronauts to the moon. NASA, for instance, wants to launch its\nArtemis 2 mission to fly astronauts around the moon in 2024.\nThe term \"solar tornado\" is only a nickname for the structure spotted on the sun, which is still poorly understood,\nexperts previously told Business Insider.\n\"What we're seeing here is polar crown filament (PCF). A filament is a huge, twisted magnetic stricture that sits above the sun's surface, sometimes for months,\" Mathew Owens, a professor of space physics at the University of Reading, told BI in an email in March.\nPlasma can be released when these magnetic fields come under too much tension and eventually break apart, Owens told BI.\nThe term \"tornado\" suggests the structure spins, but this might be a misnomer, Sven Wedemeyer, a professor of solar physics from the University of Oslo who has studied this phenomenon, told BI in March.\n\"You basically have two possibilities. Either you have some structure that's held together by magnetic fields that's actually truly rotating, or what you're seeing is plasma — hot gas — that's following some pre-twisted magnetic field and gives the appearance to be rotating, but is just moving up and down like a slight spiral,\" said Wedemeyer.\n\"One theory is if there's true rotation in there, this may trigger or destabilize the whole structure, which may contribute to this eruption,\" said Wedemeyer.\nBusiness Insider",
