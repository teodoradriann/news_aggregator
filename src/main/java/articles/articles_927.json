    "title": "No, Yevgeny Prigozhin Didn’t Suddenly Come Back From the Dead",
    "text": "Nearly a year has passed since Russia’s notorious mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash widely seen as a Kremlin-sanctioned hit , but “sightings” of the dead warlord keep making waves.\nThe latest, circulated by Wagner -linked social media channels earlier this week, centered on a blurry photograph of a middle-aged white man spotted wearing jeans and a blue button-up shirt in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, where Russian mercenaries have long had a foothold.\n“Witnesses inform that in Africa they supposedly saw Prigozhin! He was supposedly present to lay flowers for Dmitry Utkin,” one pro-Wagner Telegram channel declared. Attached was a 22-second video from a ceremony marking the 54th birthday of Utkin, the neo-Nazi commander from whom the group got its name who was killed alongside Prigozhin in the crash in Russia ’s Tver region last August. Members of the republic’s armed forces could be seen lining up to lay flowers at a monument while a man vaguely matching Prigozhin’s description stood in the background.\n“In Africa while flowers were laid [for Utkin], they noticed a person resembling Yevgeny Prigozhin,” another Wagner-linked channel claimed.\nThe video reignited wild rumors that the ex-convict turned mercenary boss had somehow staged his own death, with Wagner fanatics celebrating the supposed proof of life.\n“Yevgeny Viktorovich, stop giving yourself away,” one commentator quipped. Another proclaimed that “Prigozhin is still alive, I’m sure of it.”\nThe latest supposed sighting came just a few weeks after a similar video circulated in late May, this time from the Republic of Chad, with apparently the same stocky-looking man described as possibly being Prigozhin back from the dead due to his “manner, gestures, gait and overall appearance.” Conveniently, his face is either blurred or never fully within view of the camera.\nRelatives of Wagner mercenaries, likewise, have run rampant with speculation that Prigozhin is still alive in private chats. In one recent exchange in a Telegram group for Wagner families, a woman said Prigozhin’s death came after she’d prayed to God for him to be “punished” for using prison inmates as cannon fodder. But some who responded corrected her, suggesting it was unwise to believe he was really dead: “We’ll see who is right and who is not. If Prigozhin is alive or not.”\n“I think he’s alive, it’s just a matter of time when he’ll resurface,” another woman wrote.\nRussia’s handling of the investigation into the crash that killed both Prigozhin and Utkin has not helped matters. The Kremlin refused to allow an international probe into the disaster on board the Brazilian-made Embraer jet when Brazil ’s aircraft investigation authority offered one last year. Vladimir Putin then claimed Russian investigators had found grenade fragments in the bodies of the dead passengers, and perhaps to further muddy the waters, lamented that toxicology tests had not been done to check those on board for the presence of drugs or alcohol.\nRussian investigators have not revealed their final conclusions, if they are in fact attempting to make any. In the interim, Wagner has been able to capitalize on the mystery surrounding Prigozhin’s final moments.\nAnd perhaps that’s the point.\n“In part, there is a genuine sense of loss amongst the ‘turbo-patriots’ who hung onto Prigozhin’s coattails, and an eagerness to believe he could still be around. But there is also the cynical pursuit of clicks by outlets which monetize themselves through engagement; there is still considerable interest in everything to do with Prigozhin, amongst both those who revere and those who despise him,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security issues and author of a new book about Prigozhin, Downfall , co-written with Russian-American journalist Anna Arutunyan.\n“Keeping the myth alive is good business!” Galeotti told The Daily Beast.\nSean McFate, an expert on mercenaries and professor of strategy at the National Defense University and Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, said it’s possible Prigozhin’s trolls are “spreading rumors and/or some of his mercenaries are.”\n“If Prigozhin is alive, I doubt he would be hanging out in Africa. More likely on a yacht somewhere,” McFate said. “It’s hard to know for sure about Prigozhin’s death since the Kremlin prevented third parties from confirming it.”\nThe post No, Yevgeny Prigozhin Didn’t Suddenly Come Back From the Dead appeared first on The Daily Beast .",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — There was certainly no lack of enthusiasm for the NBA G League game between the Salt Lake City Stars and Mexico City Capitanes as over 5,000 middle school students from the Granite School District were in the stands.\nTo the students' delight, Kearns High School student Britton Buckingham played the role of public address announcer on Wednesday, introducing the starting line-up for the Stars.\nAfter FOX 13 News showcased Britton's talents on the PA for Kearns basketball games last month, the front office of the Utah Jazz affiliate took notice of the 17-year-old.\n\"After seeing the video, I just knew that this game was perfect for it and we had to give Britton the opportunity because the Stars stand for what we always say: It starts here,\" said team spokesperson Megan Zipfel. \"And that's building the opportunity and building the talent of the next generation of the NBA.\"\nWhen Britton got the call from the team, he almost passed out.\n\"I was like, there was no way! I mean this is above college! This is above everybody, this is like a really big deal!\" he admitted.\nBritton’s story is inspiring because despite being born with spina bifida, he refuses to let his condition get in the way of chasing his dreams.\n\"He always wanted to be a part of the NBA and this just opened doors and we are amazed, wonderful,\" shared Britton's mom, Jenny.\n\"He was given a gift with his voice,\" added Scott Buckingham, Britton's dad. \"It's just amazing to see him do something he enjoys to do on this level.\"\nBritton knows he needs more experience before the NBA comes calling, but in the meantime, he has no problem being a role model for people facing obstacles in life.\n\"Whether you’re in a wheelchair or whether you’re walking not as well as everybody else, you can still do amazing, amazing things,\" he said. \"God put you on this earth to do amazing things.\"",

This is something you need to be prepared for if you plan to go out for New Year's Eve!\nFor DFW, temps are expected to be around 40° by midnight but breezy north winds will have it feeling closer to freezing. The farther north you are, wind chills will likely already be in the 20s by midnight.\nAnd we will all be feeling those brisk wind chills by Monday morning. Area-wide feels-like temps in the 20s are expected by 7 a.m. Monday – a chilly start to 2024!\nWe do have some rain in the forecast for Tuesday into early Wednesday. We also must watch the system that is forecast to bring rain to North Texas on Friday. A lot still needs to be ironed out with the late-week system, and the track and strength of the upper low would have to be just right to see any sort of rain/snow mix on Friday.\nFor now, we're keeping the forecast as a cold rain, but it is something we'll be watching closely.",

    "text": "New Zealand v Bangladesh: Black Caps need answers to save T20 series\nNew Zealand v Bangladesh: Black Caps need answers to save T20 series\nIt’s not the losing that worries Jimmy Neesham and the Black Caps — it’s how they’re losing.\nAnd after a couple of results that have been “difficult to swallow”, New Zealand must quickly shake off the shocking batting collapses that brought about those defeats by Bangladesh.\nFour days after the hosts were dismissed for 98 in the final ODI, a much-changed batting group slumped to 20-4 en route to another loss in the first T20 on Wednesday night.\nBoth results at McLean Park were historic, Bangladesh beating the Black Caps in New Zealand for the first time in the two limited-overs formats. But while one could be waved away — a dead rubber in an irrelevant series — the second was much more consequential.\nBangladesh now have two chances to earn a maiden series victory of any kind in New Zealand. And the next T20 World Cup, in the West Indies and United States, is little more than five months away.\nStarting this cycle with an unprecedented setback would be less than ideal. But ahead of Friday night’s second match at Mount Maunganui, providing forecast rain stays away, Neesham knows his side has little time to reverse a worrying slide.\n“You can’t dwell too much on a loss. The way you lose is probably more important than the actual loss,” Neesham said.\n“We’ve got nowhere to go now. We’ve got to win two in a row to win the series. So we’ll go away and more have a think — we don’t have the time to actually work on things — have a refresh and have a talk about where we went wrong.”\nThat conversation will likely centre on how the Black Caps played the new ball, or, in Glenn Phillips’ case, how they didn’t.\nAs in the third ODI, New Zealand were asked to bat in the first T20 and once more they battled when the Bangladesh bowlers generated movement in helpful but hardly inhospitable conditions.\nThe top order was new, only Mark Chapman and Adam Milne played both matches, but the result was the same, as Phillips’ ill-considered leave of a straight delivery from Shoriful Islam saw a third wicket fall inside two overs.\nBangladesh have had the Black Caps on the run. Photo / Photosport\nBangladesh experienced greater difficulty chasing the Black Caps’ 134-9 than while overhauling 98 a few days earlier. But the tourists again appeared far more comfortable on an unfamiliar surface, reaching their target with five wickets and eight balls to spare.\nIt’s rare for the Black Caps to be comprehensively outplayed in consecutive matches at home. When it does happen, the opponent is generally a cricket heavyweight: India in an ODI series in 2019 and T20s the following year; Australia in a T20 series in 2021.\nBut Neesham, who top-scored with 48 from 29 balls, credited Bangladesh’s ever-improving seam attack for denying the Black Caps any comfort at home.\n“We probably need to respect the conditions a little bit more,” the veteran allrounder said. “We’ve seen the ball moving around quite significantly, especially in the top six overs today and the 10 overs in the ODIs. That’s not something we’re used to seeing in New Zealand very often in white-ball cricket, so we probably need to have a discussion about that.\n“But Bangladesh have unearthed a couple of quality seamers recently and they’ll be pretty happy with their seam stocks at the moment. If they can continue developing like that then I see no reason why they can’t have more success in overseas tours.”\nThe Black Caps’ batters will be pleased to leave behind Napier and enjoy a couple of outings on what’s generally a good track at Bay Oval, where in eight completed matches the hosts have averaged a total of 187. Neesham, though, added a note of caution.\n“It’s challenging — probably another ground that suits Bangladesh a little bit with their spinners,” he said. “So we certainly have our hands full looking at the series.”\nKris Shannon has been a sports journalist since 2011 and covers a variety of codes for the Herald.

    "text": "After decades of a majority of male names among those awarded the National Research Awards the new edition turns the trend around and recognizes for the first time more women than men. Specifically, the awarded researchers represent 70% of the total list, which was announced this Thursday by the Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities (MICIU), Diana Morant. Also parity among the young winners, where the list is distributed equally between female and male names.\nThe awards have 20 modalities worth 30,000 euros each and are “the most important recognition in Spain in the field of scientific research,” according to Morant, who has also added that “excellent science not only contributes to progress and well-being of society, but also to the strengthening of our country.\nThe minister has also stressed that this “is the edition with the highest number of women awarded, since in previous years fewer female researchers were nominated.” This is due, according to the ministry, to the fact that this edition has included “measures to encourage the submission of candidatures by female researchers to the call”, requiring that institutions presenting candidatures would have to opt for at least two candidates, men. and woman. If more were submitted, 40% had to be women. On the other hand, this edition has introduced the participation of the MICIU Women and Science Unit in the 10 jury meetings with the aim of incorporating knowledge in the field of gender and science and avoiding unconscious biases.\nThe minister highlighted that, “for the first time since the awards were announced, two women have been awarded in the categories of Physical, Materials and Earth Sciences and in Medicine”, breaking with a historical anomaly. why women did not have adequate representation in these areas.\nIsabel Fariñas, Eugenio Oñate, Gloria Corpas, Carmen Ayuso, Miquel Canals, María Carmen García, Tomás Torres, Ramón Martínez, Xavier Tolsa and Núria Sebastián have been awarded the National Research Awards, which distinguish those researchers from Spain who They stand out for their career and international relevance in their respective areas of research.\nFor their part, Jerónimo Carlos Rodríguez, Víctor Vilarrasa, Cristina Blanco, Patricia Altea, Rosa María Fernández, Beatriz Pelaz, María Escudero, Aitor Villafranca, Verónica Bolón and Mar Reguant have been awarded the National Research Awards for Young People, which recognize the merit of young people – with a maximum age of 40 years – who have achieved relevant achievements in the early stages of their careers.\nIn the Santiago Ramón y Cajal modality, Isabel Fariñas, professor at the University of Valencia in the department of Cellular Biology, Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, has been selected. He has received the award for his outstanding scientific career, recognized both nationally and internationally, and the excellence of his research with great social impact.\nHis original contributions to the biology of neurotrophic factors and neural stem cells and their applications to the treatment of neurological diseases stand out.\nFor its part, in the Juan de la Cierva category, the award was given to Ramón Martínez, professor in the Department of Chemistry of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, at the Interuniversitari Research Institute for Molecular Reconeiximent i Desenvolupament Tecnològic (IDM, center mixte UPV-UV).\nThe impact of his scientific career and its transfer in the field of chemistry and, specifically, nanotechnology and its use in sensors for medical, environmental and agri-food applications is highlighted. The jury has valued the high number of patents obtained and licensed by the winner. Likewise, the number of companies it has created is recognized, one of them being the first in the world focused on the development and commercialization of senolytics.\n#time #history #National #Research #Awards #recognize #women #men",

    "title": "Huge surf pounds beaches on West Coast and in Hawaii with some low-lying coastal areas flooding",
    "text": "Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding. Forecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach. A high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet (8.5 to 10 meters) and up to 40 feet (12 meters) at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. In Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate. “Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. \"I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.” The same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers. “I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident. While not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn't resist. Patience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast. “I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they're kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.” In Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet (5.5 to 6.7 meters) along west-facing shores of five islands. Professional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side. Paishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning. “It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said. He warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.” Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said. “This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said. The dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned. ___ Jennifer Sinco Kelleher reported from Honolulu.",
