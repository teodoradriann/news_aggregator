    "title": "Aaron Rodgers Slammed By Host Over 'Horrible, Awkward' Interview",
    "text": "As the NFL prepares to kick off the 2024–25 season, Aaron Rodgers will likely be making the rounds on radio shows. After all, he has been a regular on The Pat McAfee Show in recent years, sometimes to significant controversy . But one place we can probably not expect the 40-year-old New York Jets quarterback to turn up is on WFAN’s morning sports talk show Boomer and Gio , after a disastrous appearance last year.\nOn Wednesday's show , Gregg \"Gio\" Giannotti, who has hosted the show alongside Boomer Esiason for the past seven years, called the August 2023 Rodgers interview the \"the most awkward, horrible\" moment in the show's history. Giannotti recalled the incident while speaking with Jon \"Stugotz\" Weiner, who hosts The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz on ESPN Radio and was filling in for Esiason for the week.\n\"Honestly, I'd rather you interview Aaron Rodgers than us, after what happened last year,\" Giannotti said. \"And I’m dead serious about that. I don’t need another crack at that. I’m fine. Honestly, you can have that, I don’t need to interview him again. I don't.\"\nStugotz then pointed out that you don't have Rodgers on your show if you want to talk about football, as he's much more interested in discussing aliens and conspiracy theories .\nWhen asked whether he led with football, Giannotti said: \"No, that's the thing ... I led with, ‘Does he buy his own furniture?’ And he was not happy. And then Boomer went to a dishwashing story, he was even angrier.\"\nAt the time, Rodgers had just plunked down $9.5 million for a home in New Jersey, as he was preparing for his first season with the Jets. (Of course, we all know how that panned out .) But Rodgers, who had gotten stuck in traffic on his way to the studio, clearly did not want to discuss furniture or washing dishes.\n\"That had a lot to do with his day,\" Giannotti continued. \"But I'm just assuming he's gonna have that type of day again, it's New Jersey, you know? These things happen.\" They then briefly played a clip of the pair attempting to talk to Rodgers about traffic, and he indeed did not seem amused.\n\"Please, for the love of god, just post it somewhere so people can listen to it, I cannot listen back to that. I really cannot,\" the co-host said, to which it was pointed out that the full 18-minute interview is on YouTube.\n\"So yeah, if you'd like to listen to the most horrible, awkward 18 minutes of the Boomer & Gio show,\" Giannotti quipped. \"I don’t think he ever looked at us. Not one time.\"\n\"It was a combination of everything,\" he later recalled. \"It was him being upset, us freaking out when he wasn’t playing along. It's just—the whole thing was just turds in a blender.\"\n\"I can't. It's like watching a video of you crapping your pants, I'm not gonna go back and watch that again,\" he noted, admitting that one time he actually threw up in a trash can in the studio after coming in to work with a stomach bug.\n\"I'd rather watch that then listen back—I swear to god—I'd rather watch me puking in a garbage pail with the norovirus than go back and listen to that Aaron Rodgers interview again,\" Giannotti added.",

    "title": "Taiwan to create its own Starlink-like satellite system to counter China offensive",
    "text": "Wu Jong-shinn, the director-general of the Taiwan Space Agency (TASA), revealed in an exclusive interview with CNN that Taiwan is currently in the experimental development phase of constructing indigenous communication satellites.\nThe proposed satellite system, once operational, will function just like Elon Musk&apos;s Starlink satellite network, albeit on a much smaller scale. Starlink, operated by Musk&apos;s SpaceX, has deployed a constellation of thousands of satellites to provide internet access globally, including in remote areas that lack conventional connections.\nSpaceX&apos;s technology has been uses by various entities worldwide, including the Ukrainian military during its conflict with Russia as well as medical facilities in Gaza following conflict with Israel.\nTaiwan&apos;s pursuit of its own satellite system arises partially from its inability to access Starlink due to SpaceX&apos;s requirement for majority ownership in a proposed joint venture, which conflicts with Taiwanese laws.\nSeeing the critical importance of communication resilience, Wu emphasised the significance of the satellite project as the agency&apos;s most sensitive endeavor.\nTaiwan&apos;s unique geopolitical position, situated about 100 miles off the coast of China, is a great indicator as to why this project is being such a high priority. With China asserting its territorial claims over Taiwan and threatening military action if necessary, it is paramount that Taiwan takes all steps necessary to ensure that they have uninterrupted connectivity.\nCurrently, Taiwan relies on 15 submarine internet cables for connectivity, but these cables are vulnerable to damage, as shown by recent incidents where outlying Taiwanese islands were cut off from the internet due to cable damage caused by passing ships.\nExperts warn that deliberate sabotage by Beijing, such as cutting internet cables around Taiwan, could lead to widespread disruption and panic.\nTo address these challenges, Taiwanese authorities have announced plans for the development of two communication satellites, with the first expected to launch by 2026.\nAdditionally, the government aims to assist private companies in launching four additional satellites to bolster the industry. However, experts caution that Taiwan would need hundreds of satellites to establish a comprehensive backup internet access system.\nBrad Tucker, an astrophysicist, estimates that at least 50 satellites would be necessary for decent emergency coverage, with even more required for optimal reliability. While achieving full internet coverage with a few indigenous satellites may be unrealistic, experts agree that Taiwan&apos;s space endeavors hold significant long-term value.\nTill then, Taiwan seeks to enhance its communication resilience by partnering with existing satellite communication systems like OneWeb and maritime satellite systems. These partnerships, along with the establishment of 700 hot spots across the island by the end of 2024, aim to provide backup connectivity during emergencies, as demonstrated during a recent earthquake.\nTaiwan&apos;s space ambitions extend beyond communication satellites, with a focus on fostering a new industry to capitalise on international space projects. President Tsai Ing-wen&apos;s commitment of NT$25.1 billion over the coming decade aims to support various industries, leveraging Taiwan&apos;s expertise in semiconductor chips and precision machinery.\nWu emphasised Taiwan&apos;s readiness to embrace this adventure more aggressively, citing ongoing efforts to develop a launch vehicle for satellite deployment into low-Earth orbit. With a solid foundation and ambitious goals, Taiwan&apos;s space aspirations reflect its determination to secure its communication infrastructure and emerge as a significant player in the global space industry.\n(With inputs from agencies)",

De esta forma, quedan excluidas de esa prohibición las quemas controladas que realiza el servicio de prevención y defensa contra los incendios forestales debidamente planificadas y disponiendo de los medios de extinción necesarios.\nAsí lo anunció ayer el Ejecutivo gallego, que ha detallado que “no dará” más permisos y los ya concedidos “quedarán en suspenso” a partir desde hoy.\nLa decisión se ha tomado tras valorar la evolución de la situación meteorológica y una vez analizados los diferentes indicadores técnicos que inciden en el riesgo de fuego. Las temperaturas podrán alcanzar los 28 grados este fin de semana.\nEn este sentido, también ha argumentado que la normativa por la que se regulan medidas relativas a la prevención de incendios forestales, a la protección de los asentamientos en medio rural y a la regulación de aprovechamientos y repoblación forestal, prohíbe las quemas en cuando las condiciones meteorológicas puedan dificultar su control.\nLa Consellería do Medio Rural pide colaboración de la ciudadanía para que extreme las precauciones y denuncie cualquier actividad delictiva incendiaria de la que tenga conocimiento. Además, recuerda que está a disposición de los ciudadanos el número de teléfono gratuito 085, al que deben llamar en caso de detectar algún incendio forestal.\nGalicia Criar a un hijo cuesta 630 euros al mes y va a más con la edad https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/19/duplex-torres-catedral-santiago-arbn-99700230.html Así era el dúplex que hubo entre las dos torres de la Catedral de Santiago y que arrasaría en Airbnb https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/19/santalices-presidente-parlamento-gallego-rueda-sorprendeume-ben-99662123.html “Rueda sorprendeume para ben, deuse a coñecer e asumiu a defensa de Galicia” https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/19/gallegas-viven-hombres-cinco-claves-99678146.html ¿Por qué las gallegas viven más que los hombres?: las cinco claves de su longevidad https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/21/xunta-reactiva-norma-agilizar-licencias-99748855.html La Xunta reactiva la norma para agilizar las licencias de obra en los concellos https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/19/vejez-seis-anos-99657597.html A la vejez, seis años más para ellas https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/19/cuantas-gallinas-puedo-tener-casa-99681297.html ¿Cuántas gallinas puedo tener en casa? https://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2024/03/20/peor-tramo-carretera-espana-6-99751629.html El peor tramo de carretera de España está en la A-6 en Lugo\nGalicia",

    "text": "Victor Wembanyama’s Season with Spurs Cut Short by Blood Clot\nVictor Wembanyama, the San Antonio Spurs' standout rookie, will likely miss the remainder of the season due to a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. The condition, which necessitates immediate treatment, puts a spotlight on the Spurs, as it follows a recent health scare involving head coach Gregg Popovich. Wembanyama's remarkable season, during which he has emerged as a defensive powerhouse and All-Star, is now overshadowed by concerns about his health and potential long-term implications for his career.\nBy the Numbers- Wembanyama averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, 3.8 blocks, and 3.7 assists this season.\n- He blocked 176 shots, setting a record for blocks by the All-Star break.\n- Wembanyama was the NBA's leading shot-blocker this season.\n- Wembanyama's condition has raised questions about the cause and future management of similar health issues in athletes.\n- The Spurs are facing a challenging organizational environment with both Wembanyama's and Popovich's health concerns affecting team morale.\nThe Spurs are expected to focus on Wembanyama's recovery while assessing the cause of his blood clot, informed by previous cases in the league. Discussions might center on his readiness for international play in the upcoming European championships, should he fully recover. The organization's handling of this health scare could shape their strategies moving forward.\nBottom LineThis development emphasizes the fragility of athletic careers and the importance of focusing on player health. The lasting impact of Wembanyama's diagnosis could affect not only his future playing prospects but also the Spurs’ ambitions in the league.\nRead more at Arizona Sports\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "Il reste encore un match à jouer pour la Lazio et toutes les équipes engagées cette saison en Ligue Europa, mais le succès des Romains jeudi soir face à la Real Sociedad (3-1) leur permet d’espérer terminer premiers de la phase de ligue de la compétition. Contre l’équipe espagnole, ils n’ont pas tremblé une minute et ont rapidement plié la rencontre. Avant de se déplacer à Braga le 30 janvier prochain, ils comptent trois points d’avance sur l’Eintracht Francfort (victorieux ce soir contre Ferencvaros, 2-0) et autant sur l’Athlétic Bilbao (pulvérisé par le Besiktas, 4-1), avec une bien meilleure différence de buts (+7).\nLes buts de la Lazio ont été inscrits par Mario Gila (1-0, 5e), Mattia Zaccagni (2-0, 32e) et Valentin Castellanos (3-0, 34e). La Sociedad est passée totalement à côté de sa première période et s’est même retrouvée à dix avec les deux cartons jaunes reçus par Aihen Munoz (12e et 30e). La réduction de l’écart, signée Ander Barrenetxea en fin de match n’aura rien changé à l’histoire (3-1, 82e).\nManchester United devra encore lutter\nDans le même temps, Manchester United s’est fait une petite frayeur chez lui face aux Glasgow Rangers. Après avoir bénéficié d’un but contre-son-camp de Jack Butland (1-0, 52e), les Red Devils ont concédé l’égalisation à l’approche du temps additionnel (88e) mais Bruno Fernandes a permis aux siens de sauver la baraque quatre minutes plus tard (2-1, 90e+2). Un résultat qui permet à United de se hisser à la quatrième place avec quinze points.\nLa qualification directe est encore loin d’être acquise pour les hommes de Ruben Amorim. Il leur faudra réussir un bon match chez les Roumains du FCSB, quant à eux huitièmes. Pas une partie de plaisir.",

    "text": "Please consider a gift for Aleteia! Help us spread the joy of Christ's victory. Aleteia depends on your support. Join our Lenten Campaign 2024. [DONATE NOW](https://aleteia.org/support-aleteia/?utm_campaign=easter2024&utm_content=cta&utm_medium=inread_box&utm_source=en_aleteia) A parish with the largest Hispanic congregation in the Archdiocese of Baltimore “stands ready” to assist the families of the six construction workers who disappeared in Tuesday’s bridge collapse, said its pastor. Redemptorist Fr. Ako Walker, the pastor, was called just hours after the catastrophe happened and sat with family members as they awaited news of their loved ones. Two workers were rescued Tuesday, soon after a container ship plowed into one of the pillars of the [Francis Scott Key Bridge](https://mdta.maryland.gov/Toll_Facilities/FSK.html). The crash sent most of the structure into the waters of the Patapsco River. But by Tuesday night, officials said the cold water, poor visibility, and changing currents led to a decision to call off further rescue efforts. The bodies of two of the six workers were found Wednesday morning inside a pickup truck submerged in the water. The two were identified as Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, a Mexican native who lived in Baltimore, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, originally from Guatemala, who lived just outside the city. Meanwhile, the director of the [Apostleship of the Sea](https://www.aos-usa.org) in Baltimore, a Catholic agency that works with seafarers coming into the busy Port of Baltimore, is staying in touch with crew members of the Dali, the ship involved in the accident – some of whom he had met just hours before the incident. Media reports have said all the crew members are from India. “They had reached out to me on Sunday morning,” Andrew K. Middleton, director of the AOS, told Aleteia. “They said they were getting ready to have a long trip. and they wanted to go shopping to get the things that they needed for the voyage. I had a volunteer on Sunday, so he took them shopping. They were out for five or six hours.” “I was just with those guys” Middleton has been director of the AOS for about 15 years. He said the ministry reaches out to visiting ships, in order to offer assistance to seafarers, who spend long weeks away from home. Many of the crews have gotten to know the AOS and contact Middleton when they come into port. “We try to welcome them as we welcome Christ in the stranger,” he said. A former Baltimore police officer, Middleton said that after Sunday’s shopping excursion, the sailors spent some time relaxing at the AOS’s Seafarer Center and took some books and magazines from its library for what they expected to be a 27-day voyage to Sri Lanka. “On Sunday night, two crew members reached out to me separately and thanked us for our service and our hospitality to them,” Middleton said. The next day, Middleton himself took some crew members shopping. On Tuesday morning, when he heard the news of the collision and the name of the ship involved, he thought to himself, “I was just with those guys yesterday.” He had contact information, so he immediately sent a message to one of them. “He responded within a few minutes saying that everyone was safe,” Middleton said. “Since then, I’ve just kind of periodically, three or four times throughout the day, I just send them a message to say, you know, just checking to make sure everybody’s still okay; we’re here for you. We’re praying for you.” Middleton expects that once the onsite investigation of the accident is finished, and the vessel can return to a terminal, “we can get on board and we can assess what their needs are and figure out how we can help them.” Repairs to the ship as well as the need to clear the submerged bridge structure will mean that the crew – as well as crews of other ships in port – will be there for a while. “There hasn’t been an official timeline or even an official estimate of how long this might last,” Middleton said. “I imagine that for the Dali, it’s probably going to be months.” In the meantime, the AOS is ready to provide at least the normal services it offers to seafarers. “At some point, we’ll probably start trying to find ways to provide enhanced recreational activities,” he speculated. Middleton has a staff of six volunteers and a list of four or five priests of the Archdiocese of Baltimore he calls on when needed. Sometimes Mass can be arranged on a ship or at St. Rita’s Church in Dundalk, where the Seafarer’s Center is located. It’s fewer than three minutes from the [Dundalk Marine Terminal](https://mpa.maryland.gov/pages/dundalk-marine-terminal.aspx). “It would be very easy to have the church opened up and have a Mass there [for crew members], or even if they just wanted to go in and sit before the Blessed Sacrament, that would be very easily done,” he said. Of the work of mariners, Middleton said, “It’s a dangerous profession to begin with. It’s a high stress environment on a good day. So something like this — I’m sure it lingers in the back of every seafarer’s mind now.” “I can only imagine what the crew of the Dali is feeling right now,” he said. Ministering to grieving families On Tuesday, a couple hours after the accident, Fr. Ako Walker, pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus in Baltimore, was called to be present to the families, to “accompany them, be a spiritual guide during their moment of loss,” he told Aleteia. “Being bilingual, I was invited to be there,” he said. “As I entered the room, of course, there was extreme sadness, but I also detected a bit of numbness that people were trying to come to terms with the news that they received,” he said. “And, given that the incident would have taken place only a couple of hours before that, no real answers were forthcoming, and so they were in what I call this liminal space, this space of uncertainty, this space of not being able to get the kinds of responses that they may have needed to assuage their fears and concerns about the disappearance of their loved ones.” There was pain “etched on their faces as they awaited the news,” he said. Fr. Walker, a native of Trinidad and Tobago, commended the Baltimore Police, FBI, Red Cross, Baltimore City, and Baltimore County services, “all making an effort to provide relief to these families in the midst of a very trying time, a very trying circumstance.” Although he doesn’t think any of the families are members of Sacred Heart parish and is not sure if any are Catholic, he said that at least two of his parishioners told him they knew some of the lost construction workers. And at least one parishioner has worked on the Francis Scott Key Bridge. “I like to think that while the Latino community is large, it’s also small in terms of connection and knowing one another and so on. It’s a close knit community,” he said. “So if you’re involved in construction with those kinds of activities, then chances are you will have worked on that bridge or other bridges within Baltimore.” The men who were thrown into the river when the bridge collapsed had been on a night shift repairing potholes. Although the captain of the Dali had issued a mayday call when he lost control of the ship, allowing road crews to close the bridge to traffic and thus save lives, there was very little time to get the construction crew off the span. Fr. Walker said that the grieving families are not only “saddled with the burden of the physical loss of their loved ones,” but also a major source of income has been cut off. “One of the ladies, without going into too much detail, has three young children,” he said. “So that’s a father gone. That’s a shocking reality that the children, the mother, and family have to face.” He said that a number of organizations, such as the Latino Racial Justice Circle, have already raised “quite a bit of money that will be distributed directly to the immediate families of these six victims.” Sacred Heart parish is planning to have a prayer service to honor the memory of the six men and “see how best we can assist the families that are in need at this time.” The parish also “stands ready” to “open the church” or provide a priest, if a family requests one, he said.",
