    "text": "Although theologian and author John Dorhauer has much to say on Christian nationalism, it’s a topic he doesn’t relish. “It’s not that I dislike it,” said Dorhauer, a former president of the United Church of Christ. “But if you were to ask me what I’d really like to be doing, I’d rather live in a set of circumstances where this wasn’t necessary. And yet it is necessary. I feel more proud about the call to speak and to fight for democracy than I would say I enjoy it.” At the invitation of the [Downers Grove ](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/downers-grove/)First United Methodist Church’s Mission, Justice and Community team, Dorhauer on Saturday will discuss his research on how Christian nationalism has dedicated itself to infiltrating churches and politics. The community is invited to attend the program, which is set for 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Saturday with refreshments, at First UMC, 1032 Maple Ave., and stay for an informal discussion from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Joy Doran, who co-leads the church’s Mission, Justice and Community team, learned about Dorhauer through a friend who saw him speak at [Elmhurst](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/elmhurst/) University in the spring of 2023. His lecture “Christian Nationalism: A Threat to Both Democracy and Christianity” was part of the Religious Literacy Project at the university. During Dorhauer’s talk, he explored the challenge of faithfulness in the face of Christian nationalism and the need for religious leaders and people of faith to openly discuss and confront it. Doran was able to watch a recording of Dorhauer’s lecture on YouTube. “And it was a powerful message,” she said. This will be the second workshop coordinated by the Mission, Justice and Community team. Last fall’s “In Solidarity” anti-racist workshop drew more than 80 attendees. “We felt like it was hugely successful considering we’d never done anything like that,” Doran said. “After the success, I started thinking ahead to 2024 and thought this would be a good next project.” Doran said the presentation is especially timely as the country heads into an election year. “There is so much at stake this year. … There’s a lot of controversy,” she said. “It just lined up so well in my mind and the minds of our committee.” Dorhauer, who served as the ninth general minister and president of the mainline Protestant denomination, received a masters of divinity from Eden Theological Seminary in 1988 and a doctorate in ministry from United Theological Seminary in 2004. He is the author of “Beyond Resistance: The Institutional Church Meets the Postmodern World.” Dorhauer defines Christian nationalism as “a movement to make Christianity the official religion of the U.S.” “And to rewrite the Constitution to model strict interpretations of Old Testament law,” Dorhauer said. His lecture will focus on how long the movement has been around, what its end game is and why people should be aware of it. “As a Christian, I try to state as clearly as I can that the U.S. Constitution guarantees free expression for all religions and the right to have no religious affiliation,” Dorhauer said. Dorhauer said in any election year “it is going to be important to defend democracy.” “There is never a bad time for that. Why this year it is most important is because we have already seen the threat to democracy that the previous administration was,” he said. “If we were to put [Donald Trump] back in power, not only would we anticipate a repeat of that, but the candidate himself is talking about taking it exponentially further. My great fear is if that happens we may be watching over the end of democracy as we have known it.” Dorhauer acknowledges there are some who might see that as an overreaction. “But I’m very passionate about this and I am persuaded this is not an overreaction. We have a choice between preserving democracy or watching someone preside over the erosion of our democracy,” Dorhauer said.

    "text": "Snow could fall over parts of Scotland, with Edinburgh due for sleet showers\nParts of Scotland may be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend with a second storm set to potentially strike just days after Storm Gerrit.\nMet Office forecasters say ‘treacherous conditions’ could hit Scotland on Saturday, bringing sleety gales of up to 60mph to Edinburgh, and 20cm of snow on hills in the north of the country.\nThis weather front could lead to a further winter storm, set to be named Storm Henk, according to senior meteorologist Jim Dale of the British Weather Services. The weather expert told i that this storm will bring “ferocious” winds and “may cause far more chaos” than Storm Gerrit.\nHe told the publication: “I encourage anyone travelling on New Year’s Eve to do so sooner rather than later on Sunday as these winds will be ferocious.”\nMet Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned that this ‘powerful system’ could bring similar heavy rainfall to Storm Gerrit and ‘very significant snow’ when it reaches Scotland.\nSpeaking about the 10-day weather forecast, he said: “Storm Gerrit is moving away by this stage, but another lowest forming out of the Atlantic again picked up by a powerful Jetstream and deepening rapidly as it approaches Ireland and the UK during Friday night and into Saturday.”\nHe added: “So the recipe there once again for some substantial snow over northern hills predominantly. But across Scotland certainly over the southern uplands and then into the highlands and Grampians some very significant snow building up through Saturday, 20cm plus over the tops of the mountains. So once again some treacherous conditions with the wind, rain and hills snow to contend with on Saturday. Tricky day for travelling in many places certainly.”\nThe Met Office also warned that New Year’s Eve could be wet and windy, with heavy rain forecast across most of the UK. Milder conditions are expected in southern UK areas, while cold temperatures will remain in Scotland.\nJoin Edinburgh Live’s Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\nIt comes after a ‘major incident’ was declared in Scotland due to Storm Gerrit, with a string of weather warnings issued on Wednesday.\nThousands of homes remain without power and motorists and rail passengers face continued disruption after Storm Gerrit battered the country.\nEngineers worked to restore power to around 14,000 customers, though Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution warned some could be without supply into Friday.\nHigh winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country while a Met Office yellow weather warning was in force across much of Scotland throughout Wednesday.\nThe weather conditions also disrupted travel, with some drivers trapped for hours on the A9 which was closed at Drumochter in the Highlands due to snow.\nOn the railways, many routes remain closed and will not reopen until safety checks have been carried out.",

    "text": "A former Lancefield resident is preparing to represent Australia at this year’s Invictus Games in Canada.\nA bi-annual event, the Invictus Games aims to provide competitive, adaptive sport to support wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans in recovery.\nOne of those heading to this year’s games in Whistler, Canada is Australian Defence Force (ADF) veteran Torben Louwen-Skovdam, who has a history and connection with the Macedon Ranges.\nMr Louwen-Skovdam served a 16-year tenure with the ADF and experienced a mental health breakdown in 2022, fuelled by undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder.\nFollowing this, he experienced intense anxiety attacks, increased alcohol intake, episodes of depression and suicidal ideation, and a subsequent medical discharge from the ADF in July 2024.\n“I grew up playing team sports … and I continued to play cricket and AFL throughout most of my military career. After my deployment to Sudan, I found myself withdrawing from my AFL club in Darwin,” Mr Louwen-Skovdam said.\nAfter beginning running and then avoiding social sport, Mr Louwen-Skovdam discovered the Invictus Games and realised it was something that he “really, really” wanted to do to aid with his recovery.\n“I needed the short-term fitness goal to support my physical rehabilitation, but also needed the purpose as I adjust to life outside Defence,” he said.\nWhile most connected with wheelchair basketball, Mr Louwen-Skovdam will also compete in indoor rowing, swimming, and biathlon at the upcoming games.\nHe said that his experiences growing up in Benloch and Lancefield – and seeing military convoys from nearby Puckapunyal pass through town – contributed to inspiring him to later join the ADF.\nHe and his two brothers were involved with the local Joeys, Cubs and then Scouts, later joining the army cadet unit at Braemar College.\nThe Invictus Games will run from February 8–16.",

    "text": "Lawsuits are never exactly a love fest, but the copyright fight between The New York Times and OpenAI and Microsoft is becoming especially contentious. This week, the Times alleged that OpenAI engineers inadvertently deleted data that the newspaper’s team spent more than 150 hours extracting as potential evidence.\nOpenAI was able to recover much of the data, but the Times’ legal team says the original file names and folder structure are still missing. According to a statement Filed in court on Wednesday by Jennifer B. Maisel, an attorney for the newspaper, this means the information “cannot be used to determine where the plaintiffs’ copied articles” may have been incorporated into OpenAI’s artificial intelligence models.\n“We do not agree with the characterizations made and will present our response soon,” OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom told WIRED in a statement. The New York Times declined to comment.\nThe Times filed its copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft last year, alleging that the companies had illegally used its articles to train artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. The case is one of many ongoing legal battles between artificial intelligence companies and publishers, including a similar lawsuit filed by the Daily News that is being handled by some of the same lawyers.\nThe Times case is currently in discovery, meaning both sides are turning over requested documents and information that could become evidence. As part of the process, the court required OpenAI to show the Times its training data, which is a big problem: OpenAI has never publicly revealed exactly what data was used to build its AI models. To reveal it, OpenAI created what the court calls a “sandbox” of two “virtual machines” that Times lawyers could examine. In his statement, Maisel claimed that OpenAI engineers had “wiped” the data organized by the Times team on one of these machines.\nAccording to Maisel’s filing, OpenAI acknowledged that the information had been removed and attempted to fix the issue shortly after it was alerted earlier this month. But when the newspaper’s lawyers examined the “restored” data, it was too disorganized, forcing them to “recreate their work from scratch using significant man hours and computer processing time,” several other Times lawyers said in a letter presented before the judge on the same day as Maisel’s statement.\nThe lawyers noted that they had “no reason to believe” that the deletion was “intentional.” In emails submitted as evidence along with Maisel’s letter, OpenAI lawyer Tom Gorman referred to data deletion as a “bug”.",

    "text": "Bebe celebrates after scoring Cape Verde's opening goal against Mozambique / © AFP\nFormer Manchester United forward Bebe's long-range free-kick set Cape Verde on the way to a 3-0 win over Mozambique at the Africa Cup of Nations on Friday as the Atlantic Ocean island nation became the first team through to the last 16.\nBebe opened the scoring with a dead-ball strike from 40 metres just after the half-hour mark in front of 5,794 fans at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium in Abidjan.\nCaptain Ryan Mendes doubled their lead just after half-time and Kevin Pina wrapped up the win with a stunning strike midway through the second half.\nCape Verde's biggest ever AFCON victory leaves them on six points and means they are now certain to finish on top of Group B, after they beat Ghana 2-1 in their opening game.\nTheir next match is on Monday against Egypt, who have two points and will clinch second place and a last-16 spot of their own with a win.\nMozambique, appearing at their fifth Cup of Nations, have still never won a match in 14 attempts at the tournament.\nHowever, they play Ghana next and still have a chance of qualifying, with both teams level on one point each.\nBebe smashed one free-kick against the bar and over before opening the scoring with another dead-ball strike from even further out in the 32nd minute, his effort proving too powerful for Mozambique goalkeeper Ernan.\nThe 33-year-old, born in Portugal and playing at his first AFCON, is now with Rayo Vallecano in Spain's La Liga but is remembered for an unsuccessful spell at Old Trafford in 2010/11, when he made just seven appearances.\nMozambique thought they had a penalty five minutes before half-time when Geny Catamo went down in the area in a tangle of legs with Joao Paulo Fernandes, but the Moroccan referee overturned the decision after a VAR check.\nMendes, of Turkish club Fatih Karagumruk, made it 2-0 on 51 minutes, robbing possession from Mozambique defender Edmilson Dove just outside the box and firing past the goalkeeper.\nCatamo then hit the bar with a free-kick for Mozambique, before Cape Verde scored again on 69 minutes thanks to midfielder Pina's superb strike into the top corner from almost 30 metres.\nGuaranteed to top the group, the Blue Sharks already know they will stay in Abidjan for a last-16 tie against a third-placed team on January 29.",
