    "text": "Arsenal fans are concerned about 'weak link' in their team that'll cost them the Premier League title Published | Last updated Arsenal fans are concerned that one player in their team could cost them the Premier League title. A drab [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) squandered the opportunity to go a point clear of Liverpool at the Premier League summit after losing 2-0 to [West Ham](https://www.sportbible.com/west-ham-united) at the Emirates on Thursday. After 13 minutes Jarrod Bowen poked the ball across to an unmarked Tomas Soucek, who slammed home the [Hammers](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/arsenal/declan-rice-arsenal-mikel-arteta-west-ham-683596-20231227) opener. VAR subsequently checked to see whether the ball had exited the pitch before Bowen reached it, but there was no 'clear and obvious' angle available to the officials. Former [Gunner](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) Konstantinos Mavropanos then towered above Gabriel Magalhaes and Oleksandr Zinchenko to power in a header off the underside of the crossbar to double West Ham's lead. West Ham almost capped off the win from the spot after former Hammer Declan Rice gave away a penalty in the final minute, but Saïd Benrahma had his effort saved by David Raya from 12 yards. And after [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/football/transfer-news/inter-bankrupt-arsenal-man-utd-liverpool-transfer-news-582056-20231228) futilely laboured to draw level, several fans noted that Zinchenko's defensive frailty was a concern. Loading… On X, formally Twitter, on person said: \"Zinchenko is a player who has the ability and potential to single handedly cost you the league.\" Another wrote: \"Zinchenko isn't good enough going forward to allow for his constant defensive mishaps. \"E.g. with Trent Alexander-Arnold, you can say he is truly amazing going forward that you can make allowances for his defensive play. Zinchenko isn't in that bracket at all.\" A third said: \"The biggest proof that Sofascore means nothing is that Zinchenko's rating isn't bright red.\" A fourth wrote: \"It's so over for Zinchenko when [Jurrien] Timber returns.\" A fifth said, upon Zinchenko's substation: \"We replaced Zinchenko with an attacker and look more solid defensively.\" [Zinchenko was a revelation ](https://www.sportbible.com/football/zinchenko-arsenal-piers-morgan-432042-20230303)upon signing for Arsenal from Manchester City in the summer of 2022. However, this term he has struggled for form, having registered just one goal and one assist in the Premier League. The Ukraine international was substituted for winger Reiss Nelson after 63 minutes.

Part 1 of this diary dealt with the oncoming threat of Fascism and corruption in the executive branch as exemplified by Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani during the Trump Regime. As sore losers, they are still unwilling to accept the legitimate results of the 2020 Election — one Trump lost to Joe Biden. A primary ally of Trump and Giuliani — one who believed in the discredited “Stop the Steal” nonsense in 2020 — is Ginni Thomas, wife of the one of the most-corrupt members of the United States Supreme Court in recent memory, Clarence Thomas. As 2023 draws to a close, it’s time to look at corrupt practices in the judicial and legislative branches of government as seen through the eyes of editorial cartoonists.

Dahlia Litwick points out in Slate magazine that the Supreme Court’s refusal to clean its own house and not address its ethical lapses is hurting its legitimacy with the public and undermining confidence in an institution long considered an essential pillar of American democracy. 12/20/2023- Secret Santa #ClarenceThomas #SCOTUS #SCOTUSethics #JudicialEthics #Corruption https://t.co/NJi31tgTWy pic.twitter.com/93eg5KgKpJ— Clay Bennett (@BennettCartoons) December 20, 2023 12/20/2023- Secret Santa #ClarenceThomas #SCOTUS #SCOTUSethics #JudicialEthics #Corruption https://t.co/NJi31tgTWy pic.twitter.com/93eg5KgKpJ Celebrating Christmas Every Single Day For Justices Thomas and Alito, every day is Christmas https://t.co/KrZLmKUNDc pic.twitter.com/2MHn3rU3pN— Ann Telnaes (@AnnTelnaes) December 21, 2023 For Justices Thomas and Alito, every day is Christmas https://t.co/KrZLmKUNDc pic.twitter.com/2MHn3rU3pN Attribution for the above cartoon: Ann Telnaes @AnnTelnaes The Obligatory Call from Santa pic.twitter.com/P6vnipVOlP— mike luckovich (@mluckovichajc) December 18, 2023 pic.twitter.com/P6vnipVOlP The new Speaker of the US House of Representatives is quite a guy. Mike Johnson Compares Himself to Moses at Christian Gala “In a keynote speech to a gathering of Christian nationalist lawmakers Tuesday night, House Speaker Mike Johnson compared himself to Moses, leading the GOP conference — and America — through the parted waters of the Red Sea,” Rolling Stone reports. Said Johnson: “The Lord began to wake me up, through this three-week process, in the middle of night to speak to me.” Mike Johnson and Daughter Were Profiled at ‘Purity Ball’ “The German news segment documented Johnson and his family preparing for and then attending a purity ball, a controversial formal dance event, popular among some conservative Christians, that gained notoriety in the early 2000s. At a typical event, fathers and their teenage daughters dress in formal ball attire for a night that involves dinner and dancing and culminates with the daughter signing a pledge to her father to abstain from dating and to remain sexually abstinent until marriage.” “The news segment examines purity balls and the general purity movement among conservative Christians through the lens of the Johnson family.” “In a keynote speech to a gathering of Christian nationalist lawmakers Tuesday night, House Speaker Mike Johnson compared himself to Moses, leading the GOP conference — and America — through the parted waters of the Red Sea,” Rolling Stone reports.

    "text": "SEATTLE — Activists working to save a large Douglas fir in Seattle may have convinced a developer to redesign plans to build housing around the tree instead of cutting it down. The Douglas fir has been named Vida and those working to protect it said it grows out of the edge of a property in the 1000 block of S Cloverdale Street in South Park. The property is where eight townhomes are slated to be built but a single-family home currently occupies the lot. An arborist designated the Douglas fir as “non-exceptional” and approved its removal, according to filings with Seattle’s Department of Construction and Inspections. The developer was then tasked with replanting two smaller sugar maples to make up for the loss. Joelle King, along with neighbors and activists from Tree Action Seattle and other organizations, petitioned the city to preserve the tree. They submitted comments calling for a public meeting and a redesign of the project to spare the Douglas fir. King also posted about the tree on Facebook. Robert Humble with Hybrid Architecture, the company that designed the project, came across Facebook and upon closer inspection realized it was his company that planned to remove the tree. On Thursday, KOMO News called Hybrid Architecture to confirm if the tree would be cut down or spared and the townhomes reconfigured. “My architecture firm is a strong believer in density, especially in areas with mass transit, but also a strong believer in the environment and we are trying to achieve both,” Humble told KOMO News in an interview. Humble said the tree sits at the edge of the lot and is a good candidate to be preserved while still moving forward with the housing project. The company is now working through a round of corrections and revisions that could take several weeks to complete but he believes it would be viable to have both the additional housing and still preserve the Douglas fir. “Our vision is aligned with the activists,” Humble said. “Bottom line is we are balancing the location of the trash, parking and required amenity area and requirements of city arborist and their own arborist and believe we can save the tree. We recognize the value of the tree and we think it adds value to the project.” Activists still plan to hold a gathering at 7 p.m. near the tree because nothing is finalized. They point out that South Park is one of the city’s most deforested neighborhoods, with only 12% tree canopy compared to Seattle's 28% average. They said developers should not trade trees for concrete.",

    "text": "Elon Musk might be in charge of the business of Grok , but the artificial intelligence has seemingly gone into business for itself, labeling Musk as one of the worst offenders when it comes to spreading misinformation online.\nUser Gary Koepnick asked the AI which person spreads the most information on Twitter/X—and the service did not hesitate in pointing a finger at its creator.\n“Based on various analyses, social media sentiment, and reports, Elon Musk has been identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X since he acquired the platform,” it wrote , later adding “Musk has made numerous posts that have been criticized for promoting or endorsing misinformation, especially related to political events, elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories. His endorsements or interactions with content from controversial figures or accounts with a history of spreading misinformation have also contributed to this perception.”\nThe AI also pointed out that because of Musk’s large number of followers and high visibility, any misinformation he posts is immediately amplified and gains legitimacy among his followers.\nThis, it said, “can have real-world consequences, especially during significant events like elections.”\nGrok did note that the definition of misinformation is somewhat subjective and often depends on the ideological stance of the reader. And it added, late in its answer, that there are many actors, bots and more that spread misinformation.\nThe smackdown from his own AI system, ironically, came soon after Musk touted the system to his followers in a tweet reading “Use Grok for answers that are based on up-to-date info!”\nGrok itself, it’s worth noting, was accused of spreading misinformation about state ballots in August, prompting the company to make changes to its algorithm.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",
