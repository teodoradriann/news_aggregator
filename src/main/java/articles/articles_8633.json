    "title": "Dyed in tradition: A kaleidoscope of handcrafted garments | The Business Standard",
    "text": "In the modern world where fast fashion and screen printing on clothes is so common, people forget to see the beauty in traditionally dyed clothing. Clothes that are handcrafted with these techniques not only represent the hard work of local artisans, but can also give an insight into several years of history and cultural background of the places they originate from. Besides that, they can add a dash of colour to your daily wear, spicing up your closet using patterns and designs, being both useful for daily wear and events, straying away from the monochromatic tones of plain clothes, and helping you stand out and make an impression. From the vibrant hues of Bandhani to the intricate patterns of Kalamkari, these garments offer a window into the rich tapestry of human creativity and ingenuity. Looking into these techniques means looking into the world where timeless fashion transcends fleeting trends and becomes a celebration of culture and heritage. Block printing Arriving in Bangladesh in the late '80s, block printing focuses on using printing blocks which are generically made of wood. Fabric dye is used to coat wooden blocks with designs carved into them, and the art is then stamped onto the fabric, forming beautifully detailed designs and patterns adorning the fabric with an array of colours. Abohomaan by Rufaida is a Bangladeshi clothing brand established with a speciality in block printing. \"In Abohomaan, our main product line is hand block printing because of its artisanal craftsmanship, intricate designs, sustainable and environmental friendly natural materials, as well as the cultural reflection through the patterns and motifs used in hand block printing,\" explains Rufaida Luther Anagh, owner of the brand. Their technique involves carving motifs onto wooden blocks and using these wooden blocks to stamp onto the fabric, ensuring each piece is handcrafted and customisable. This is done on pure cotton with non-toxic colours, making their clothes perfect for summer. Their clothing is highly desirable among working professionals, as it is essential for them to find a diverse array of stylish designs for daily wear without breaking the bank. When crafting their designs, Abohomaan takes inspiration from nature and changes their designs based on the weather, season or events. They combine traditional methods with recent trends by incorporating different geometric designs and patterns in their clothing, such as polka dots, owls and flowers. The pricing that they set actually depends on how long they work on a piece. What distinguishes this dyeing technique is its endless customisation potential. Abohomaan's approach is not just about clothes; it is about wearing stories rooted in tradition, sustainability, and personal style. However, one thing to highlight is that it is essential to handle block printed fabrics gently to make them last longer and protect the delicate designs. Kalamkari The word Kalamkari can be broken down to 'painting with a pen', which gives us an insight into what exactly the technique is. This form refers to art done purely by hand on fabric to form beautiful designs. Sootlee is a brand that is best known for its Kalamkari items, incorporating intricate hand-painted patterns into sarees, kurtis, blouses etc. Originally starting her business in Bangladesh, designer Rifat Jahan Lopa faced challenges due to the country's weather, in which it is inherently difficult to dry dyed clothing in, especially intricately done artwork. She then moved her operations to South India, where she set up a workstation to carry out her Kalamkari work. They print their designs using block printing or hand-paint their designs and bring them to Bangladesh, where they combine these designs with Bangladeshi materials and make new innovative products. Sootlee uses different Kalamkari methods, namely Machilipatnam, Pedana and Srikalahasti. Machilipatnam Kalamkari focuses on the block printing of fabric using vegetable dye and while Pedana Kalamkari is similar and is from the same district, it focuses on screen printing of fabric. Srikalahasti involves intricate hand painting of patterns and designs, which involves more time and effort, thus raising the costs and making it pricier. Kalamkari fabrics prove to be quite high maintenance and are not ideal for regular wear, which means they are not very popular with the younger age group. It is more sought after by middle-aged people and older people, with their demand being the highest for garments such as kurtis, blouses, sarees and tops. The pricing also depends on the length or the quality of the material, as well as how much time is spent on the design. Currently, Kalamkari fabric primarily finds its place in garments due to its delicate nature. However, Sootlee has yet to venture into incorporating it into other products. Nonetheless, they have plans to explore this avenue in the future. Bandhani Bandhani, an age-old method of fabric dyeing originating from the Khatri community in Gujarat, draws its name from the term 'Bandhan,' meaning 'to tie up.' It bears resemblance to Japan's Shibori technique and collectively falls under the modern concept of 'Tie-dyeing.' Established amidst the pandemic, 'Polka Drops', a boutique owned by Fariha Tanzim, specialises in crafting tie-dye clothing using techniques akin to those of India and Pakistan, employing natural dyes. However, to enhance durability, industrial dye is sometimes incorporated alongside vegetable dyes, especially given the latter's limited longevity. Catering to a niche market, Polka Drops predominantly works with silk or silk-cotton blends, resulting in intricately tie-dyed sarees, priced slightly higher than conventional cotton attire, typically reserved for festive occasions rather than everyday wear. Pricing factors in material, design intricacy, and production time. The allure lies in the endless customisation options, facilitating playful combinations of colours and patterns. \"I fell in love with tie-dyeing as it let me experiment with colour, and because of the way you can make so many designs and patterns simply by using only colour and threads or ropes,\" said Fariha. The tie-dye process involves tying the fabric in various styles to decide the resultant pattern, followed by immersion in the dye, with longer durations intensifying the colour. Unlike block dyeing or painting, this solely involves tying the fabric up and letting it do its own work, each flaw or imperfection adding to the uniqueness and beauty of it. Since this form of dyeing requires the fabric to be hung up and dried, the real struggle arises during the rainy season, as the drying process is complicated and lengthened due to our country's endless showers and humid air. Although Polka Drops produces Bandhani sarees in order to cater to a niche platform of customers, Bandhani can be used to produce fabric with different shapes and designs which are used for traditional sarees, ghagras and other dress material, as well as bed linen and upholstery.",

These are the words of the annual economic analysis by Confindustria and SRM, the research centre linked to the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. In 2024, GDP growth in the South is estimated at +0.6%. \"The confirmation of this data,\" the study explains, \"will be considerably influenced by the actual \"grounding\" of the available resources, primarily those related to the PNRR. Employment, recorded in the third quarter, increased by 4% compared to last year, with an increase for the South; but the increase in employment does not correspond to a significant progress in absolute terms if the data are related to the share of those living in the South. The Synthetic Index of the Southern Economy for 2023 grew for the third consecutive year and rose by 8.8 points. The estimate of the figure for investments in the South is very positive, +4 percentage points compared to 2022 and 17 compared to 2019, \"confirming a dynamic that must certainly be strengthened\".

    "text": " Des soldats suédois participent à un exercice militaire de l'Otan, le 8 mars 2024, à Alta, en Norvège Des soldats d'élite de l'armée suédoise se frottent les mains près de leur véhicule blindé, lors d'un exercice militaire de l'Otan vendredi dans l'Arctique norvégien. Et le froid n'explique pas tout. Ces soldats suédois sont aussi très satisfaits de participer, enfin à part entière, à cet exercice militaire de grande envergure, le premier depuis que leur pays est officiellement devenu jeudi le 32e membre de l'Alliance atlantique. L'invasion russe de l'Ukraine le 24 février 2022 a décidé la Suède à renoncer à 200 ans de neutralité pour rejoindre l'Otan. Non sans mal. La Turquie et la Hongrie, pour des raisons différentes, s'y sont opposé pendant deux ans avant de lever leur veto au début de cette année. \"Je pense que ça valait vraiment le coup d'attendre\", déclare à l'AFP Karl-Johan Ryden, 21 ans, l'officier suédois commandant l'un des navires participant dans le nord de la Norvège à cet exercice militaire. Un soldat suédois d'une unité amphibie participe à un exercice de l'Otan à Alta, dans l'Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 \"C'était un très long processus\", renchérit le commandant Joakim Sjögren. \"Mais on a toujours cru que ce serait un oui en définitive, donc on s'était préparé à cela\", ajoute-t-il. Le Nordic Response exercise (exercice de réponse nordique), fait partie de l'opération Steadfast, le plus important exercice militaire lancé par l'Otan depuis la fin de la guerre froide, avec quelque 90.000 hommes et femmes mobilisés. Et si la Suède y participe cette fois à part entière, ce n'est pas la première fois que son armée se retrouve aux côtés des Alliés pour un exercice militaire ou une mission de l'Otan. le commandant suédois pour les opérations conjointes, Carl-Johan Edström, lors d'un exercice militaire de l'Otan, à Alta, dans l'Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 \"Je dirai qu'au niveau tactique, au niveau des unités, pour les soldats et les officiers, il n'y a pas vraiment de gros changements, parce que nous nous entraînons avec l'Otan ou participons à des opérations de l'Alliance depuis les années 2000\", a expliqué de son côté le commandant suédois pour les opérations conjointes, Carl-Johan Edström. \"Mais pour la Suède en général, il s'agit bien sûr d'un gros changement. C'est le plus important depuis 200 ans, un vrai changement d'état d'esprit\", a-t-il ajouté. Le vice-amiral norvégien Rune Andersen estime de son côté que l'adhésion de la Suède à l'Otan, après celle de la Finlande l'an dernier, ouvre \"une nouvelle ère dans la manière de coopérer en matière de défense dans la région nordique\". Un soldat suédois participe à un exercice militaire de l'Otan, le 8 mars 2024, à Alta, en Norvège \"Nous travaillons ensemble depuis longtemps, mais l'adhésion élimine beaucoup d'obstacles\", souligne-t-il depuis le pont d'un navire des garde-côtes norvégiens. Selon ce gradé norvégien, la Suède peut maintenant être totalement intégrée aux plans de défense de l'Otan, ce qui n'était pas le cas auparavant. Et surtout, elle va désormais bénéficier de la protection de l'article 5 du traité de l'Atlantique nord, qui a créé l'Otan en 1949. Pilier de l'Alliance, cet article prévoit l'obligation pour chaque pays membre, y compris la Suède, d'aider les autres alliés en cas d'attaque, a encore expliqué cet officier norvégien. Des soldats suédois d'une unité amphibie participent à un exercice de l'Otan à Alta, dans l'Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 Et pour le vice-amiral américain Douglas Perry, à la tête du Norfolk Command de l'Otan qui contrôle l'Atlantique et les régions arctiques, l'adhésion de la Suède va permettre à l'Alliance de l'intégrer totalement à ses scénarios de défense contre la menace russe. Et sur ce point, \"ils mettent beaucoup de choses sur la table\", a-t-il affirmé, en soulignant la position stratégique de la Suède dans les Mers baltique et arctique. La Suède a décidé de rejoindre l'Otan au moment où la perspective d'un conflit entre la Russie et les Alliés semble désormais moins éloignée depuis l'invasion russe de l'Ukraine. La nouvelle recrue Vera Nylander à bord d'un navire de guerre suédois, lors d'un exercice militaire de l'Otan, à Alta, dans l'Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 A bord d'un navire de guerre suédois, la nouvelle recrue Vera Nylander, appuyée sur sa mitrailleuse, garde cependant tout son sang froid. \"Je prendrai les choses comme elles viennent\", affirme-t-elle avec flegme. \"Je pense que nous sommes prêts, on s'est entraîné pour cela, si cela doit se produire\".",

A key pillar of the Montana Jewish Project’s mission is inclusivity, and their Pride Shabbat celebrated the LGBTQ+ community.\nThe July 11 event was open to all with free admission, and about 50 guests attended. Drinks and appetizers were served on the synagogue’s lawn at 5 p.m., followed by Shabbat blessings, including candle lighting, prayer and kiddush, which involves a blessing said over a full cup of wine or grape juice to welcome Shabbat.\nGuests watch Erin Vang, who donned a prayer shawl and a kippah, lead the Pride Shabbat blessings on Friday.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project “Traditionally, Jews growing up have only heard the word of God in Masculine Hebrew,” Julie Bir, board chair of the MJP, explained as Shabbat Blessing pamphlets were dispersed among the crowd. “We wanted to provide Shabbat blessings for all identities.”\nThe Blessing pamphlet included traditional masculine and feminine Hebrew, as well as a gender-neutral words developed by Jewish musician Emily Joy Goldberg.\nThe rainbow Challah from Helena bakery Dear Potato that was served at Friday night's Pride Shabbat.\nCourtesy, Dear Potato The food offered was from Dear Potato, a Helena bakery that specializes in Eastern European baking. They brought piroshkis — a savory pastry filled with meat — and rainbow-dyed challah, a braided bread served for ceremonies and special occasions in Jewish cuisine.\nThe Temple Emanu-El was completed in 1891 and was for a time the only synagogue between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Portland, Oregon. As the Jewish population in Helena steadily decreased, the building was sold to the state government in the 1930s. It was then purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Helena in the ‘80s, who sold the building to its current owners, the Montana Jewish Project, in 2022.\nA child and adult lounge Friday on the lawn of the Temple Emanu-El. One of the Shabbat blessings is a Blessing over the Children, which celebrates Jewish heritage and honors family connection.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project “This temple is more than just a building. It’s a symbol of resilience and belonging,” Erin Vang, an avid member of MJP gatherings who led the Shabbat blessings on July 11, said during her introduction to the event.\nRebecca Stanfel is the executive director of the Montana Jewish Project, and Pride Shabbat is one of her favorite events of the year.\n“Our main goals are to connect Jewish people across Montana, and to uplift other minority groups in the state as they have a rich history here just like the Jewish community,” she said.\nDonna Andersen, an MJP board member and a New York native, is proud of the organization’s work.\n“I came from one of the largest Jewish communities in the country to an incredibly small one when I moved here three years ago,” the 27-year-old said. “But since joining the board in 2021, it’s been amazing to see how we can find people outside of Helena who are curious about the messages of Judaism.”\nGuests listen to the introduction of Friday night's Pride Shabbat event on the lawn of Temple Emanu-El.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project In her conclusion of the Shabbat Blessing, Vang addressed an environment of hatred and division she felt was facing the LGBTQ+ community, which she is a part of. Her final blessing was the Shehecheyanu, one not traditionally said during Shabbat. But it is said as an acknowledgement of new beginnings.\n“Take this Shabbat as a time of rest, because when it ends, we have work to do,” she said.\nKaty McCumber is a news intern at the Helena Independent Record.\n0 Comments",

    "text": "About 37 million U.S. adults are estimated to have chronic kidney disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and most are undiagnosed.\nLeft untreated, chronic kidney disease, or CKD, can progress into kidney failure or cardiovascular disease.\nExplore AAP updates child obesity treatment to include medication, surgery for some One way to lessen the risk of developing the condition might be to get BMI under control as a teenager, a new study has found . According to the National Survey of Children’s Health , about 1 in 6 U.S. children ages 10-17 are obese, defined by having a BMI higher than 30.\nResearchers led by Gilad Twig from the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research in Israel analyzed nearly 600,000 youths ages 16-20 to explore any relationship between risk of high BMI and early CKD.\nThe scientists had previously shown a link between higher youth BMI and the need for kidney replacement surgery, Newsweek reported . Their new study revealed a link between high BMI and early chronic kidney disease, even when there was no indication of diabetes.\nExplore Here’s how many Georgia youth are obese, according to 2020 report Although the scientists are still unclear how the biochemical mechanisms work, they said they believe fat tissue can secrete molecules that can inflame the kidneys. In addition, soluble fats can build up in other organs.\nMales appeared to be more at risk than females, the researchers found. They said this could be because estrogen protects the kidneys and because the fat distribution between the sexes differs.\nThe scientists said they hope their study will help parents and teens control BMI before it leads to more serious conditions.\nAbout the Author\nNancy Clanton Nancy Clanton writes and edits stories of local interest about health, travel, events and entertainment.
