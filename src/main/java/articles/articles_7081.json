    "title": "Protest at Catholic girls school a sign of ‘deeper malaise’ in Northern Ireland | The Independent",
    "text": "A loyalist protest at a Catholic girls school in north Belfast in 2001 was a sign of a “deeper malaise” in Northern Ireland according to Bertie Ahern , new archives show.Officials who compiled documentation of efforts to resolve the protest also noted criticisms of DUP MP for Belfast North Nigel Dodds for his actions, and said that then First Minister David Trimble’s efforts were integral.For months in 2001, locals at Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast stood outside the school as girls and parents walked inThe protest began following a clash in June 2001 as a man collected his child.“He was, according to nationalists, attacked by loyalists when he objected to them putting up paramilitary flags on the Ardoyne Road,” a briefing note stated.Efforts to resolve the issue over the summer break failed, and the protests resumed in the autumn.Loyalists said they were protesting because of attacks on their community, which they claimed were prompted by the larger Catholic population and wanted better security in the Ardoyne area as a result.The note from November said: “The hate-filled aggression the loyalist protesters showed to the primary school girls and their families has disturbed, dismayed, and angered people throughout Northern Ireland and in the wider world beyond.”On October 18 2001, Fr Aidan Troy had an hour-long meeting with Mr Ahern in which he discussed the impasse over the protest, which had been ongoing for months.Fr Troy, parish priest of Ardoyne and chair of the board of governors of the Holy Cross school, said that there were around 20 people on both sides of the road in the morning, and 60-70 people on each side in the afternoon.“A hard core” of local residents took part in the protests and there was also a “sinister” loyalist paramilitary involvement, as well as people from other loyalist areas taking part, according to notes taken of the meeting.Fr Troy said that some residents from Glenbryn, the protestant and loyalist area around the school, expressed support for his work, usually anonymously because of the “climate of fear” surrounding those who opposed the protest.He said that some children and parents had been subjected to abuse including “balloons filled with dog excrement and urine, scalding water, stones and a blast-bomb”.A blast bomb attack had taken place the day before the meeting on Alliance Avenue.Of the 220 pupils at the school, 35 were stressed and receiving counselling and medication, and 10 had been transferred to other schools.The priest expressed concern that the protest could “drag on indefinitely”, as it was a no-cost effort from protesters, and said this could put an “intolerable strain” on the school community.He also said that there was “a leadership vacuum” in Glenbryn, which was an impediment to progress, and the referral to a committee of 14 people with “no common agenda” made it difficult to find a resolution.Fr Troy also said that while he appreciated the work of police to protect children on the way to school, he was “unhappy” that protesters were allowed to be so close that they were able to “spit at the children” and was confused as to why armed soldiers faced towards the parents and children.Mr Ahern said that the root causes of the protests were a “symptom of a deeper malaise within Northern Ireland”.He offered to raise the issue during a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair the next day, but said that genuine progress could only be achieved through engagement and agreement at local level.Fergal Mythen, an Irish official in the Security Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, compiled the notes of the meeting on October 22 2001.In notes taken by the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat, dated November 21, it said Fr Troy was “reasonably confident” of an end or suspension to the protest ahead of a meeting with Mr Trimble and deputy first minister Mark Durkan.Mr Dodds, who was to chair a meeting of residents at Stormont, was noted as a sign of a possible deal, as “Dodds has sat on the loyalist fence on may issues and is not known to stick his neck out unduly”.In a briefing dated November 26, it called Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan’s meeting with Glenbryn residents the previous week, as well as a prompt follow-up letter “instrumental in creating the climate for a discontinuation of the protest”.The material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/67.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "text": "U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee and Co-Chair of the U.S. Senate Navy Caucus, Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) introduced the Protecting Public Naval Shipyards (PNSY) Act to exempt the workforces of America’s four public shipyards, like the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, from recent hiring freezes and mass layoffs. The Senators’ new bipartisan bill ensures that the maintenance and overhaul of America’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet continues uninterrupted by requiring the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to exempt certain positions at public shipyards from workforce reductions.\n“Our shipyard workforce represents an essential component of our national defense and preparedness – they should have never been subjected to this administration’s ill-considered hiring freezes,” said Senator Shaheen. “The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workforce is supposed to be exempt from the hiring freeze, but there continues to be issues with implementation. Our bipartisan bill enshrines that exemption in federal law and ensures that no public shipyard is subjected to such chaos and uncertainty in the future, allowing them to focus instead on the vital role they play in our national security.”\n“The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is a critical hub that helps power our economy and protect our national security,” said Senator Hassan. “This bipartisan bill will ensure that important naval operations continue without disruption by exempting public shipyard employees from the chaotic mass firings, workforce reductions, and hiring freezes directed by the Trump Administration. I will always stand up for legislation that helps keep America safe, secure, and free.”\n“Our nation’s public shipyards depend on a highly skilled and experienced workforce,” said Senator Collins. “At Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, workers set the gold standard for repairing, retrofitting, and refueling our nation’s nuclear submarines. This bipartisan bill would protect the men and women at PNSY, and at all four of our nation’s public shipyards, helping sustain the critical contributions these shipyards make to our national defense, the readiness of our Navy, and the economies of their surrounding regions.”\n“Our commitment to our national security relies on continued, sustainable investments in our shipyard workforce — not a reckless hiring freeze,” said Senator King. “Portsmouth Naval Shipyard plays a critical role in keeping our country safe, but there has been a lack of follow-through on the unprovoked employment pauses and mass layoffs there, so we are elevating this issue to legislation in order to maintain our nation’s safety and security, as well as the livelihoods of the men and women who power the shipyard. The Protecting Public Naval Shipyards Act will ensure the public shipyard workforce stays exempt from further pauses, empowering our shipyards to focus on defense unfettered by irrational hiring policies.”\nThe Senators’ Protecting PNSY Act would require DoD to exempt positions at the public shipyards from workforce reductions that are critical to maintenance of our submarine fleet and that support the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program (SIOP). The bipartisan bill also removes hiring limits for these positions.\nThe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard needs to hire 550 personnel every year to meet the Navy’s demand for maintenance and overhaul for the submarine fleet. Under current administration personnel management policies, the Navy is limited to hiring no more than 1,550 external personnel across all naval institutions each month – far too few to meet the demand of America’s public shipyards.\nAfter calls from Shaheen and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), the U.S. Department of Defense exempted the shipyard workforce from the civilian hiring freeze – but issues persist in its implementation. Shaheen, Collins and Angus King (I-ME) recently visited Portsmouth Shipyard with Navy Secretary Phelan, and subsequently sent a letter to OPM urging the agency to process personnel that have been hired and are awaiting onboarding into jobs. Shaheen secured Secretary Hegseth’s commitment to investigate these hiring delays at a recent SASC hearing.\nSenator Shaheen has long advocated for New England’s shipbuilding industry and workforce, including through authorizing funding and workforce development for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. In the Committee-approved FY26 NDAA, Shaheen secured full authorization for the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program (SIOP) investments at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. She also secured a number of other provisions to increase capacity at the Shipyard and improve quality of life.\nSource: Jeanne Shaheen",
