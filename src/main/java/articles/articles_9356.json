    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "Matthew Ehret: The Plymouth Brethren, British intelligence and mystic cults in Palestine",
    "text": "Historically, British intelligence has supported both Islamist cults throughout the Arab world and the most fascist and violent Zionist ideologues, writes Matthew Ehret. This “should not be seen as contradictory in any way.” He highlights the role of British intelligence assets in Palestine in the mid-1800s and first half of the 20th century. These intelligence assets were also either Plymouth Brethren or Freemasons. George Hawkins Pember, another Plymouth Brethren, whose works on ancient mystery cults, Zionism, prophecy, and even alien interpretations of scripture have done an incredible amount of damage in shaping imperial strategic planning for over 150 years, Ehret says. Previously Ehret described that without the force of numerous anti-Semitic fascists throughout the last two centuries, Zionism would have never been possible. He continued to set the scene by describing “apostolic” cults operating under the banner of Christianity which contributed to the belief that all Jews should be sent to Palestine and describing the role of the Knights Templar. Ehret recently wrote an essay titled ‘Sir Henry Kissinger: Midwife to New Babylon’ describing how Henry Kissinger’s 2012 prophecy that “in 10 years, there will be no more Israel” is linked to mystical Babylon. As his essay is more than most would read in one sitting, we are republishing it in sections over a series of articles, you can read Part 1 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/24/the-babylon-conspiracy-two-angles/), Part 2 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/26/without-numerous-anti-semitic-fascists-zionism/), Part 3 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/27/gnostic-cults-masquerading-as-christian-movements/) and Part 4 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/28/knights-templar-and-the-kingdom-of-jerusalem/).

Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox… The Plymouth Brethren Start Religious Fires Another Plymouth Brethren cultist played an important role in British Mandate Palestine. Colonel Charles Wingate was a leading figure in Darby’s sect and ensured that his son, Colonel Orde Wingate, would follow in his father’s shoes as a deviant imperialist and Christian Zionist. Orde Wingate worked closely with Christopher Sykes (son of Mark Sykes of Sykes-Picot fame) and was sent to British Mandate Palestine in 1935 to train Zionist paramilitary groups. He created a network of elite ‘Night Squads’ working in tandem with [Jabotinsky’s Haganah paramilitary group.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah) [As demonstrated by the pioneering work of Steven P. Meyer,](https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2009/eirv36n03-20090123/eirv36n03-20090123_036-netanyahus_godfather_how_british.pdf) Vladimir Jabotinsky was a British intelligence asset from Ukraine who was groomed in the Freemasonic Young Turk operation set into motion by Lord Palmerston and Giuseppe Mazzini in the 1840s. He was a Jewish fascist admirer who Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, called “Vladimir Hitler” due to his adoption of Nazi practices and his rabidly racist ethnonationalist attitude. In a letter to his cousin, [Orde wrote](https://larouchepub.com/pr/site_packages/2002/sharon/dec2000brit_darbyites.html): “The Jews are loyal to the Empire… Palestine is essential to our Empire – our Empire is essential to England – England is essential to world peace. We have the chance to plant here in Palestine and Transjordan a loyal, rich and intelligent nation, with which we can hold for us the key to world domination without expense or effort on our part.” It is a notable irony that Col. Orde Wingate had two very influential “pro-Arab” Orientalist cousins: 1) E.G Browne, sponsor of Al-Afghani, the spiritual father of Salafiyyism and 2) T.E. Lawrence, whose manipulation of Bedouin Hashemite tribes drove the British Empire’s first ‘Arab Spring’ against the weak Ottoman Empire during World War I. British Mandate Palestine Grand Mullah Haj Amin [ frequently collaborated with British intelligence](https://cynthiachung.substack.com/p/nazis-the-british-and-the-middle) from Britain’s Cairo office, including the Muslim Brotherhood, to 1) assassinate moderate Arabs seeking economic cooperation with the Jews and 2) kill Jews to stoke revenge sentiments similar to the earlier programme of keeping Protestant vs. Catholic wars ablaze in Europe. Haj Amin’s story as a British asset and provocateur is told in full by Cynthia Chung in her book ‘ [The Empire in Which the Black Sun Never Set](https://canadianpatriot.org/untold-history-of-canada-books/)’. [ [4]] British intelligence’s support of Islamist cults throughout the Arab world, from al-Afghani (founder of Salafyyism) [to the Muslim Brotherhood,](https://vigilantcitizenforums.com/threads/muslim-brotherhood-connection-with-the-british-freemasons-dr-raslan-documented.9551/) and their simultaneous support of the most fascist and violent Zionist ideologues should not be seen as contradictory in any way. Rather, this support is united by one firm principle: maintain global dominance for the Church of the British Empire. With a game so dirty, one shouldn’t be surprised to discover that Wingate’s [fellow British intelligence agent](https://archive.org/details/secret-agent-666-spence-crowley) and self-professed satanist Aleister Crowley himself [emerged out of Darby’s Plymouth Brethren sect.](https://julesevans.medium.com/crowleys-children-d1eb234c050) Mystery Babylon from a New Lens Plymouth Brethren grand strategist George Hawkins Pember (1837-1910) is known as one of the most influential of Darby’s sect. His works on ancient mystery cults, Zionism, prophecy, and even alien interpretations of scripture have done an incredible amount of damage in shaping imperial strategic planning for over 150 years. In his book ‘ [The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming of the Kingdom](https://therabbithole.wiki/mystery-babylon-the-great-and-the-mysteries-and-catholicism-an-exposition-of-revelation-17-and-18-and-an-account-of-the-rise-of-the-roman-catholic-church-under-pagan-influences-by-g-h-pember-1941/)’, Pember laid out the challenge of interpreting what the “Whore of Babylon” might be. This information is very important for anyone wishing to calculate the days until the End Times. Pember followed the Pre-Millennial Dispensationalist line by extracting the cataclysmic events into the future. “It would seem, that Babylon must be rebuilt and become again the centre of the world and the glory of kingdoms, as we have it represented in the eighteenth chapter of the apocalypse,” he wrote. But who is this Babylon that must rise to power to usher in the End Times? Is it Russia? Is it the papacy? Is it the British Empire? Or is it something else? As a devout Christian Zionist cut from the cloth of Palmerston, Churchill, or Eichmann, the answer is clear, according to Pember. In his book ‘The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming of the Kingdom’, he wrote: “The wonder is that the restoration of Babylon has never yet been attempted … As soon, however, as Christendom is united in the form of the Ten Confederate Kingdoms, all jealousy will be at an end, and the great prize may then be seized for the common good. No doubt commerce will be the exciting motive: the civilised world will, perhaps, combine to build a great central emporium, which by their united exertions will quickly surpass all other cities, and finally become the capital of the Antichrist.” Keeping in mind the role of the Plymouth Brethren and gnostic intelligence operatives of the Palestinian Expedition Fund in creating Zionism in the first place, let’s review once more the region proclaimed by Herzl, Jabotinsky, and other Greater Zionists as the divine land ordained by God’s covenant for the “chosen people”… Today, the Anglo-Zionist project has grown from an aggressively demonic foetus to a vicious, full-grown monster. It appears intent on fulfilling a divine prophecy to recreate a new Babylon while provoking a war with literally every Arab neighbour surrounding them. The maps of Babylon 539 BCE and Herzl’s fantasy are eerily similar. America’s nuclear arsenal will likely support Zionist ambitions to purge the land of Arabs, starting with Palestine and followed by Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and possibly Saudi Arabia, as outlined by the [neo-con Clean Break Doctrine](https://canadianpatriot.org/2023/11/29/the-clean-break-doctrine-a-modern-day-sykes-picot-waging-war-and-havoc-in-the-middle-east-2/) submitted to Netanyahu in 1996. But are all Americans (or even Israelis) happy about this scenario? Judging from the mass protests in the US against Netanyahu’s current war and the collapse of his support within Israel itself, the answer is no. But do the voices of the people who will be exterminated in the wake of a global nuclear war have any influence over the decisions made by imperial ideologues marching about Washington, London or Tel Aviv? That remains to be seen. I would also pose the question: Is it at all possible that the forces that birthed the Zionist project may ultimately see their creation as a disposable pawn in the great game? Is it also possible that these same forces don’t even see the US as a permanent fixture of the “end of history” some imperialists wish to see emerge onto the scene? These are just a few questions to ponder. With all of this in mind, it is worth revisiting [Henry Kissinger’s 2012 prophecy](https://infiniteunknown.net/2012/10/05/henry-kissinger-in-10-years-there-will-be-no-more-israel/) that “in 10 years, there will be no more Israel.” Footnotes: [4] Specifically Chapter 11: “ [Nazis, the British, and the Middle East.”](https://cynthiachung.substack.com/p/nazis-the-british-and-the-middle) Part 6, and the final part, in our series is the sections of [Ehret’s essay](https://canadianpatriot.org/2023/12/21/sir-henry-kissinger-midwife-to-new-babylon/) titled ‘The Fall of Babylon 2.0?’, ‘Kissinger’s Role as a Midwife to Satan’ and ‘Kissinger’s Devotion to the British Empire Means More Than You Think’.

    "text": "LOS ROSTROS DEL AÑO (V) Luis Rubiales, el beso que inició la revolución Sus actitudes machistas empañaron el histórico Mundial ganado por la selección, pero permitieron que se iniciará una ola de empoderamiento con un poderoso lema: #SeAcabó Con perdón... Quizá, ahora, pasados ya cuatro meses, con tiempo para acercarse al escándalo, a la presunta agresión sexual y a las presuntas coacciones posteriores, con perspectiva y distancia, haya casi que dar las gracias (entiéndase) por ese beso no consentido que [Luis Rubiales](/es/personajes/luis-rubiales-5815) le propinó a [Jenni Hermoso](/es/deportes/20231214/jenni-hermoso-deporte-hecho-inmune-95863076) tras la final del Mundial femenino de Sídney, el pasado 20 de agosto. Sí, es algo que nunca debió haber pasado. Sí, fue [un acto machista](https://www.epe.es/es/deportes/20230831/tio-luis-rubiales-asegura-sobrino-91526269), como sus tocamientos de genitales en el palco, que degradó a las mujeres, a los hombres, a España, al fútbol, al deporte, al buen gusto, al sentido común... Sí, fue la perfecta definición gráfica del machismo que sigue impregnando nuestra sociedad, del que se ve y del muchos aún no perciben a simple vista, porque siguen creyendo que, \"bueno, mujer, un fue un piquito sin importancia, tampoco es para tanto\". Es, además (y por encima de todo), una presunta agresión sexual, conviene no olvidarlo, que muy probablemente le lleve a juicio, a la espera de que el juez escuche el día 2 de enero [el testimonio de la víctima](https://www.epe.es/es/deportes/20231124/audiencia-nacional-traslada-2-enero-declaracion-hermoso-rechaza-prueba-rubiales-95047404), Jenni Hermoso, y cierre la instrucción. Un presunto delito que sirvió para que muchos hombres en España comprendieran lo que debía ser evidente por sí mismo: que un hombre no puede besar a una mujer sin su consentimiento, que un superior no puede besar a un empleado/a a su cargo como si tal cosa. El tuit de Alexia No, no fue un «piquito» amistoso y eufórico, fruto de la alegría de haber ganado un Mundial, como defiende una y otra vez el expresidente de la RFEF. Fue el desagradable e indeseable germen de una revolución. Hoy, todos sabemos lo que significa y lo que implica ese #SeAcabó acuñado, de manera espontánea, por [la dos veces Balón de Oro Alexia Putellas](https://www.epe.es/es/deportes/20230825/alexia-putellas-defensa-jenni-hermoso-caso-rubiales-91335493) en un tuit, tras aquella asamblea de la vergüenza en la que Rubiales pronunció su quíntuple \"no voy a dimitir\" que dinamitó cualquier posible vía para que escapara con cierta dignidad del bochorno en el que se había ido sumergiendo. Para siempre quedará aquella secuencia de la vergüenza, narrada por Rubiales, en la asamblea: \"Ella me dijo: ‘Eres un crack’. Y yo le dije: ‘¿Un piquito’?. Y ella me dijo: ‘Vale’\". Conviene no olvidarlo, Rubiales fue cavando su propia tumba con determinación durante una semana en la que había una noticia sobre el tema cada hora. Empezó con el beso y siguió con ese vuelo de vuelta de Sídney en el que trató de convencer a Hermoso de que sacara la cara por él. Ella misma no le dio la importancia a la agresión en un primer momento, como reconoció, pero sí cobró conciencia horas después de que aquello no era una anécdota. Era algo muy grave. Aquella asunción en frío de la gravedad de los hechos por parte de Hermoso fue interpretada por Rubiales como una traición, una venganza. Y no dudó durante la semana posterior en utilizar su poder en la RFEF para [tratar de humillarla](https://www.epe.es/es/deportes/20231106/jenni-hermoso-rompe-silencio-rubiales-94276386) (otra vez), con mensajes que se movían entre el paternalismo y la condescendencia, afirmando que a Jenni le habían lavado el cerebro para mancharle a él. Nos abrazamos y ella me dijo: ‘Eres un crack’. Y yo le dije: ‘¿Un piquito?’. Y ella me dijo: ‘Vale’ Seis días después de la final del Mundial, la FIFA, contra todo pronóstico, intervino [suspendiendo temporalmente a Rubiales](https://www.epe.es/es/deportes/20231030/fifa-inhabilita-luis-rubiales-durante-tres-anos-93994212) de todos sus cargos, para posteriormente inhabilitarlo durante tres años. Una contundencia inesperada por parte del organismo que rige el fútbol mundial, acostumbrado a mirar hacia otro lado cuando uno de los suyos es el afectado.

Si no llega a ser por la FIFA, Rubiales habría seguido siendo el presidente de la RFEF hasta el domingo 10 de septiembre, cuando anunció su dimisión en una entrevista (muy bien pagada, según se cuenta) con el periodista británico Piers Morgan. El Gobierno llegó muy tarde Quedaba apartado del fútbol un dirigente que había hecho crecer de manera exponencial en cinco años el presupuesto federativo, pero que también había instaurado una toxicidad insoportable en su relación con el resto de agentes de la industria. Sobrevivió tanto tiempo porque el Gobierno le protegió, algo de lo que se sigue arrepintiendo a día de hoy, aunque nadie lo vaya a decir en voz alta. En paralelo a la reestructuración de despachos, con la llegada como interino de un [Pedro Rocha que ansía convertirse en unos meses en presidente de pleno derecho](/es/deportes/20231124/elecciones-federacion-rocha-territoriales-candidaturas-plazos-94966811), el fútbol femenino asistió a una revolución. Las campeonas del mundo, empoderadas por su victoria en Sídney, recibieron también un apoyo masivo ante la actitud de Rubiales en los días posteriores al beso. Desde entonces, han logrado mejoras en sus condiciones como internacionales, han contribuido a regenerar la RFEF y han colocado el fútbol femenino en la agenda políticas, mediática, social. Quizá, en cierta medida, todo valió la pena. Con perdón...

    "text": "[[German](https://www.borncity.com/blog/2025/01/09/eu-kommission-verstoesst-mit-datentransfer-an-meta-gegen-dsgvo/)]Big slap on the wrist for the EU Commission from the European Court of Justice. In proceedings before the ECJ, the Commission was ordered to pay damages to a German activist because the EU Commission had given data to Meta and thus transferred it to the USA.\nAdvertising\nI came across the EU judgment T-354/22 issued on January 8, 2025 via the following [BlueSky post](https://bsky.app/profile/bo-datenschutz.bsky.social/post/3lfae6ztxs22v), among others.\nThe judges from the European Court of Justice ruled that the EU Commission must pay damages to a German citizen (plaintiff) because it did not comply with data protection regulations (GDPR). The background was that the plaintiff from Germany, who is interested in IT and data protection, visited EU Commission websites in 2021 and then in March 2022 and logged in to a conference page of the EU Commission via his Facebook account or the \"Log in with Facebook\" option. The plaintiff discovered that data was allegedly transferred to Meta USA and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe plaintiff then asked the Commission's Data Protection Officer for GDPR information regarding the data transmitted during the website visits. Secondly, the citizen asked to be informed which personal data concerning him had been processed or stored and which, if any, had been transferred to third parties. Thirdly, he asked to be informed of the legal basis for this transfer and any guarantees for the transfer of data to third countries without an adequate level of protection.\nOn December 3, 2021, the later plaintiff received information from the Commission's data protection officer. He could view the data collected via a link. In addition, the later claimant was informed that the personal data concerning him had not been transferred to recipients outside the European Union and would only be stored and processed on the website of the Conference on the Future of Europe.\nAdvertising\nAfter several inquiries from the data subject were not answered comprehensively, the data subject brought an action against the EU Commission on June 9, 2022, as can be read in the text of the judgment. In the action, he requested,\n- annul the transfers of personal data concerning him to third countries without an adequate level of protection that took place on March 30 and June 8, 2022.\n- He also applied for a declaration that the Commission had unlawfully failed to take a position on his request for information of April 1, 2022.\n- And he requested that the EU Commission be ordered to pay him 1,200 euros plus interest.\nThe damages should amount to 800 euros as compensation for the damage caused by the violation of his right to information and 400 euros as compensation for the non-material damage caused by the transfer of the personal data concerning him to third countries without an adequate level of protection. Furthermore, the applicant wanted the Commission to be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.\nThe EU Commission's application resulted in the action being declared null and void and the damages being dismissed and the plaintiff being ordered to pay the costs.\nIn the judgment, the EU Commission's application for \"nullity\" was rejected and the EU Commission was ordered to pay damages of EUR 400. The ECJ considered it proven that when registering under \"EU Login\" on the conference page on March 30, 2022, personal data relating to the plaintiff, in particular his IP address, was transferred to servers of the social network Facebook in the United States.\nWith the hyperlink \"Sign in with Facebook\", which is displayed on the \"EU Login\" website, the EU Commission has created the conditions for the transmission of the plaintiff's IP address to Facebook. At the time of registration, however, there was no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for a data transfer to the USA.\nThis adequacy decision was overturned by the ECJ and was only later (2023) replaced by a new decision (see [European Commission adopts adequacy decision for EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework](https://borncity.com/win/2023/07/10/european-commission-adopts-adequacy-decision-for-eu-u-s-data-privacy-framework/)) – which is now also being challenged before the ECJ. The ECJ lists the following decisions in the judgment:\n- The action is dismissed as inadmissible as regards the application for annulment [of the data transfer to the USA].\n- As regards the application for a declaration that the European Commission unlawfully failed to take a position on the applicant's request for information of April 1, 2022, there is no longer any need to adjudicate on the substance of the case.\n- The Commission is ordered to pay the plaintiff EUR 400 as compensation for the non-material damage suffered. Further claims for damages are rejected.\nThe court orders the Commission to bear its own costs and to pay half of the applicant's costs. The applicant has to bear half of his own costs. Reuters has compiled the decision made be the Judge within [this article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/first-eu-court-fines-eu-breaching-own-data-protection-law-2025-01-08/).\nAdvertising",

    "title": "How Idaho became the target of an influence campaign to protect pesticide companies - East Idaho News",
    "text": "Published at | Updated at POCATELLO ( Idaho Statesman ) — Clutching handwritten notes on yellow sheets of paper, Idaho state Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, stood up to debate against a bill. The proposal before lawmakers, a month into the legislative session, would have limited the damage pesticide manufacturers faced from thousands of lawsuits. Those manufacturers included Bayer, an agrochemical giant and major employer in eastern Idaho. Ruchti, a trial lawyer, argued that the bill would bar Idaho residents harmed by chemicals from any way to seek relief. There’s “only one place” where they “can go toe to toe with a multibillion, multinational corporation and have a shot at getting justice,” the Democrat said. “It’s in a courtroom.” Ruchti’s broadside against the bill and subsequent testimony from far-right Republicans signified an unusual bipartisan coalition of lawmakers aligned against legislation that would grant wide immunity to manufacturers of agricultural chemicals . The bill failed by four votes. But the proposal marked the beginning of pesticide companies’ expensive, nationwide push to limit the damage from court actions filed over the potential harms caused by their products . A day later, Syngenta, a Chinese government-owned pesticide maker, registered two lobbyists with the Secretary of State’s Office. In the three months of the legislative session, the push from the industry brought tens of thousands in public advertisements, thousands of dollars of campaign donations, free bottles of Roundup, and private calls with Bayer’s CEO — all aimed at convincing legislators to seal off prominent herbicides like Roundup from most liability lawsuits. Sens. Rick Just and Janie Ward-Engelking, Boise Democrats who opposed the bills, told the Idaho Statesman they were both offered and accepted phone calls with Sebastian Guth, Bayer’s CEO, and that lawmakers were given free bottles of Roundup. “It seemed to be a pretty full-court press,” Jonathan Oppenheimer, a lobbyist with the Idaho Conservation League , which opposed the bill, told the Statesman by phone. Nearly identical bills followed in Iowa and Missouri, which along with Idaho represent a trio of states where Bayer, the German manufacturer that controls Roundup, located its U.S. operations. Bayer, which purchased Roundup’s creator , Monsanto, has already paid out billions in jury verdicts and settlements. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and paraquat, used in herbicides made by Syngenta, are two of the most popular weed killers in the U.S. Both have disputed links between their products and fatal diseases and have settled with plaintiffs for billions in total. Bayer and Syngenta have denied their products cause disease. To critics, the slate of proposed bills and influence campaign were attempts by an industry player to inoculate itself from liability for harming people. An unusual alliance between the state’s most hard-line Republicans and Democrats kept the bills from passing this year, and the efforts in Iowa and Missouri also failed to become law. But lawmakers and analysts in Idaho expect similar pesticide bills to make another appearance next year. Khaldoun Baghdadi, a lead attorney on a case involving 5,000 farmers who sued Syngenta, told the Statesman by email that if such a bill became law, “Idahoans exposed to paraquat who have since developed Parkinson’s disease would have been prevented from pursuing justice for their injuries.” Some of the plaintiffs live in Idaho. “The bill would have also sent the message to foreign agrichemical giants like Bayer and Syngenta that they are free to sell their dangerous products in Idaho with impunity,” he said, “even when they conceal and ignore science in pursuit of profits.” Bayer wants protection from lawsuits Sen. Mark Harris, R-Soda Springs, in February introduced the first version of the pesticide liability bill to a Senate committee. He explained that it would protect farmers, agriculture, and the state’s mining industry, and would reduce reliance on foreign countries for chemicals. Then he turned his time over to James Curry, Bayer’s deputy director for state and local government affairs. Though corporations are rarely listed as crafting Idaho bills, Roger Batt, a lobbyist for Bayer, was a listed sponsor of Harris’ bill. Curry told senators that the bill would protect companies like his from “frivolous” lawsuits and argued that glyphosate is safe. He said his company needed help from the Legislature and that legal costs were threatening Bayer’s bottom line and its ability to conduct new research. Two lobbyists for Bayer spent more than $8,000 on travel and entertainment of lawmakers, according to secretary of state records. At least six lobbyists pushed this winter to pass the pesticide legislation. The Idaho Grain Producers Association took out full-page print advertisements in newspapers across the state, including the Statesman, asking lawmakers to pass a version of the bill. “Side with Idaho Farmers Not Trial Lawyers,” read one. “Protect Idaho Farmers’ Access to Glyphosate,” read another. “Don’t make Idaho farmers reliant on China.” In total, the association spent nearly $50,000 on advertisements for the bill. Stacey Satterlee, a spokesperson for the association, said Idaho’s wheat and barley farmers rely on the chemical. “We need to have access to chemistries, we need to have access to pesticides,” she said. “The threat of having them taken away is real.” Monsanto, the company that originally sold Roundup, later developed genetically modified seeds that were resistant to the chemical, cornering a profitable market by offering farmers a means to kill weeds without affecting their crops. Producers of sugar beets, corn and soybeans in Idaho use the chemical and the seeds, Satterlee said, while wheat and barley farmers use Roundup. Idaho’s crops are a $5 billion industry, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture . International and U.S. regulatory agencies have sparred over whether glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, could cause cancer. While the Environmental Protection Agency told the Statesman the “overwhelming consensus” is that it’s “unlikely ,” some studies have found a “compelling link” between glyphosate exposure and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer. The disputed links to cancer have led to a flood of lawsuits over the last decade. Though Bayer has won most of its recent trials, the German company has sustained major losses: Since it acquired Monsanto six years ago, Bayer has settled nearly $11 billion worth of claims, and juries have awarded billions in damages . Tens of thousands of cases are still outstanding. In the six years since Bayer acquired Monsanto, its stock prices have fallen by 76%. The lawsuits against Bayer have focused on a type of court action known as “failure to warn,” which means plaintiffs allege a company did not properly warn consumers about its product’s risks. The pesticide bills, if passed, would prohibit those claims entirely so long as the company placed the EPA-approved pesticide label on the product. Records have shown both Monsanto and Syngenta tried to foreground scientific research displaying their products’ safety and discount research that found the opposite , according to national reports. Curry, a Bayer lobbyist, said efforts in California to label Roundup as a carcinogen, as well as the litany of lawsuits, are “creating uncertainty about how we move forward providing that product here in the United States.” Representatives of Bayer maintained in an interview with the Statesman that passing their proposed law would still leave companies open to legal liability if people believed they had knowingly withheld information linking its products to disease. Jess Christiansen, a Bayer spokesperson, said the company is heavily regulated and that its glyphosate products are safe. The company adjusted its off-the-shelf Roundup formula to remove glyphosate, while the version sold to farmers still contains the chemical, she said. But a legal expert and opponents of the legislation, like Daniel Hinkle, a senior counsel at the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers, told the Statesman the new law would bar most lawsuits. “Bayer’s lawyers in court and Syngenta’s lawyers in court would argue that this (law) completely eliminates and wipes out” future lawsuits, Hinkle said. David Pimentel, a University of Idaho law professor who teaches tort law, told the Statesman that removing “failure to warn” lawsuits would be a “huge” win for the industry because it “insulates them from a huge layer of liability.” It also puts “tremendous confidence” in the EPA, he said. Paraquat, another type of pesticide, is also widely used in the U.S. Syngenta produces many of these paraquat products and is owned by the Sinochem Corp., which the Defense Department previously classified as a Chinese military company . Syngenta faces thousands of lawsuits over its own products and registered its own lobbyists on the Idaho bills. Paraquat used as labeled has “no link” to Parkinson’s disease, the EPA told the Statesman by email. In a written statement, a spokesperson for Syngenta said products approved by the EPA “do not pose any unreasonable risks.” “Syngenta rejects the claims of a causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease because it is not supported by scientific evidence,” spokesperson Kathy Eichlin said. She added that “no scientist or doctor has ever concluded in a peer-reviewed scientific analysis” that paraquat causes Parkinson’s. A hard push to pass Idaho pesticide bill The sequence of pesticide bills displayed the behind-the-scenes workings of the Capitol, where lobbyists and lawmakers carefully count votes in committees and on the floor to see whether a bill would pass. In the three weeks after the first bill failed on the Senate floor, lawmakers introduced two other versions that made concessions: one that wouldn’t outright ban lawsuits against the manufacturers, but would set a high bar for lawsuits to proceed, and another that would put a sunset on the bill after 2027. Sen. Scott Herndon, R-Sagle, told the Statesman that lawmakers dropped the later versions of the bill in part because Bayer’s lobbyists were keeping tabs on how senators felt about the new bills, and eventually concluded they would have failed on the floor, too. A similar course was proceeding in Iowa, where the state’s Senate amended one of the early bills to exempt any pesticides manufactured by Chinese state-owned companies . The proposal would have kept in place protections against Roundup lawsuits but potentially allowed claims against Syngenta to proceed. Syngenta opposed that version of the Iowa bill. Other industry supporters of the Idaho bill included the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, and Amalgamated Sugar. The Idaho Freedom Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, gave the versions successively better ratings, ranging from a poor -2 to a neutral zero on the final version. Bayer and a political action committee of its employees made contributions in January to Republican leaders’ re-election campaigns. Senate Pro Tem Chuck Winder, R-Boise, Senate Majority Leader Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, bill sponsor Harris, and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, each received the maximum $1,000, while House Majority Caucus Chairman Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, and Assistant House Majority Leader Sage Dixon, R-Ponderay, got $500. The company also gave $10,000 to the Idaho Prosperity Fund, a business-aligned PAC. Oppenheimer said his environmental group became particularly worried about the potential for a pesticide bill to pass after the third version was backed by Senate Republican leaders in the waning days of the session. At a Senate hearing, Winder said the pesticide bill was a “going home bill,” a term lawmakers often use to describe their highest-priority agendas. The bill never got a hearing. Ruchti told the Statesman that without legal recourse, corporations can secure protection simply by going to the Legislature. “They’ve got the resources to bring a bunch of lobbyists in and tell a very one-sided story,” he said. Herndon, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus who coordinated the limited Republican opposition to the bills with Ruchti, said he can understand why lawmakers are concerned about farmers in their districts losing access to products they feel are essential to their operations. But he said those same agricultural workers are the people most likely to be harmed by a dangerous chemical. Herndon said lobbyists for Bayer were “constantly” meeting with lawmakers during the session and were particularly focused on swaying Republicans who had voted against the first version. The company’s lobbyists likely hoped some who opposed the bill would no longer be at the Capitol next year, he added. Herndon lost his re-election bid in the GOP primary last month. When days remained in the session, he said the efforts escalated, and that Batt and other lobbyists told him Bayer would have to fire their 800 employees in Southeast Idaho and declare bankruptcy two weeks after the session ended if the bills didn’t pass. “I bet you two weeks after the session you’re not going to file bankruptcy,” Herndon said he told them. “And guess what? I was right. But nice threat.” In an email, Batt told the Statesman that he never said the company would be filing for bankruptcy, but rather shared with lawmakers a Bloomberg report that the company was considering a bankruptcy filing. Batt said Bayer representatives shared with legislators that if the company were “forced to continue to pay out billions in ridiculous punitive damage awards,” it could be making some cuts that impact those employed in Idaho. Bayer could bring another bill forward in Idaho next year and scheduled a luncheon for lawmakers in January 2025, according to a copy of the calendar obtained by the Statesman. Harris told the Statesman that a bill next year might get more votes if lawmakers get more “education” from Bayer beforehand. “I was surprised how many Republicans were using environmentalist talking points on the issue,” he said. “It kind of made for a strange alliance between those Democrats and those Republicans that opposed the bill.” He said Bayer brought the idea for the bill to him because they were “going on the offensive.” Harris represents Soda Springs, where the company located its phosphate mines and manufacturing plant, and said residents of his district have relied on Bayer for jobs for years. Though tens of thousands of claimants have brought lawsuits against Roundup around the country, none have yet been filed in Idaho, according to the company. Herndon said the proposed sunset provision was a “dead giveaway” that Bayer hoped to make Idaho a model state, which could help it pass similar legislation across the country. The company also looked to change laws at the federal level. In Washington, D.C., U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, is a cosponsor on a bipartisan federal bill that would extend immunity protections against labeling lawsuits across the country. Simpson has received $12,500 in donations in the past two years from PACs connected to Bayer and Syngenta and thousands more from other agriculture industry groups. Oppenheimer said he recognizes that the science about harms is disputed and that farmers see value in the chemicals. But he said courts give plaintiffs an opportunity for their injuries to be evaluated, and that he is concerned about the tradeoffs for public health and the environment of using these chemicals. “Ultimately it’s a question of, ‘If this is such a certifiably safe product, then why in the world would you need immunity from any liability?’” he said.",
