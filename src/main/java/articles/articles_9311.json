    "text": "Kaavia James experienced what pretty much every adult has experienced this holiday season — the infuriating frustration that comes with knowing you know the right way to do something (stuff the turkey, wrap the presents, yada yada), and being downright ignored by your family. The 6-year-old looked like she might lose her mind in a new video where she’s gearing up to sing “The Twelve Days of Christmas” with her parents Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade .\n“You need to play the song,” she says to the adults who are listing off the lyrics and repeating them back to one another. Kaavia — who keeps throwing her head back, sighing, and rolling her eyes — is clearly thinking, “Why are we yapping when we could just get to singing?” Related story Kaavia James Models Matching Pjs With Her Mom Gabrielle Union in a New Video & She’s the Cutest Kid Influencer",

    "text": "Residents of a swampy area in central South Sudan battled with cattle herders who moved in looking for water and pasture during the dry season, and at least 38 people were killed and 52 suffered gunshot wounds, officials said Thursday.\nThe fighting started Wednesday and tensions remained high Thursday night, with officials reporting “minor clashes” and apprehension over revenge attacks in the remote area.\nThe information minister of Warrap state, William Wol Mayom, said fighting took place in the Alor area, which is in Lakes state and borders both Warrap and Unity states.\nMayom said security forces had been sent to calm the situation and to move the cattle herders away from the disputed wet lands.\n“The violence has been de-escalated, but minor clashes are still being reported in inaccessible swampy areas and casualties cannot be fully verified,” Mayom said.\nA police spokesperson for Lakes state, Maj. Elijah Mabor Makuach, said 19 of the dead and 17 of the wounded were civilians from Warrap state and 19 of the dead and 35 wounded were from Lakes state.\nMakuach said young herders from Warrap migrated to the Alor area with their cattle two weeks ago and began burning brush and the temporary shelters of residents. He said the herders were looking for pasture and water in the swampy lands of Alor.\nThe bloodshed came four days after at least 52 people, including a U.N. peacekeeper, were killed and 64 wounded by gunmen who attacked villagers in Abyei, an oil-rich region that is claimed by both Sudan and South Sudan. Officials said that violence also arose from a dispute over land.\nSouth Sudan won its independence from Sudan in 2011 after more than 39 years of war and then plunged into a ruinous internal conflict from 2013 to 2018 that stagnated development. Many guns remain in the hands of civilians who fought in the conflicts.",

    "title": "Why Your Smartphone Battery Is Making Noise- and How to Fix It",
    "text": "Battery noises are a whole different story, and a battery that makes noise is not a normal situation we’ve all thought to cont with. If your smartphone battery starts to emit a strange, hissing, whistling sound, then pay attention. Why does this happen and how can we fix it? Let’s take a look.\nWhy is there a whistling battery? Gassing Lithium-ion batteries are known to release gases, if over heated or damaged. Usually, this takes place if the battery has been over pressed or mishandled. Internal Short Circuit Heating occurs from a short circuit inside the battery, which produces faint hissing or clicking sounds. It’s easy to see how this could turn into a full blown problem though, like a fire hazard. Fluid Leak Noise caused by pressure buildup or leakage can also be caused if a battery starts to swell or leak fluid. It’s a clear warning sign if it’s visible swelling. Faulty or Aging Battery Older or defective batteries may even make strange noises or otherwise not work as they should. The Whistling Sound — What to Do. If your phone’s battery is making noise, take immediate action:\nTurn Off Your Phone: Let it stay down until it stops being a threat. Disconnect from Charging: If it’s charging, safely unplug the device. Inspect for Damage: Look for signs of swelling, leak, or crack (if it’s possible). Place in a Safe Area: Don’t place the phone near flammable items. Contact a Professional: Contact the manufacturer or a certified technician for help. Pro Tip: Don’t overly handle a damaged battery, as it could be unsafe.\nOther Noises to Be Aware Of Not all sounds from your phone indicate a battery problem:\nLoose Components: Camera lenses, or internal parts which aren’t part of the battery, may make a rattling sound. Electrical Interference: Charging can cause some faint electrical noises due, but they are usually harmless. If the sound doesn’t go away or you sense there is something wrong, see a specialist to get them for a thorough examination.\nWhen in Doubt, Act Fast A whistling phone battery isn’t normal and can be an indicator of overheating, leaks, or even an electrical risk of explosion. Be serious about any unusual noise you hear and deal with it quickly to ensure you and your device are safe.",

    "text": "San Francisco 49ers defensive star\nFred Warner and one-time reality dating show contestant Sydney Hightower Warner announced this week that they're expecting a baby boy.\nSydney, who grew up in Alabama, was cast on pilot Peter Weber's season of \"The Bachelor\" that aired in early 2020. Although she was eliminated in week six, the show still led to love for the then-retail marketing manager: Sydney said Warner hit her up on social media. “He actually sent me an emoji [because] he didn’t think I was gonna respond and that’s why he got really casual,\" she told\nUS Weekly, \"but it was sweet.\"\nThe pair began dating and got engaged in May 2021 —\ncomplete with a red rose a la \"The Bachelor.\" The Warners married about a year later in Vista, San Diego County. This is their first child together.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nOn Tuesday, the pair announced they're having a boy with an adorable video posted to Instagram. \"Can I look at it first?\" Sydney asks nervously as they wait to click on the news, presumably from their health care provider. \"Stop, let's go,\" Fred says. Then, spoiler for your ears, Fred lets out a joyful scream as they learn they're having a boy.\nIt's a busy time for the Warner family. On Sunday, the 49ers end the regular season at home against the Rams. Then, they're set for a first-round bye week after\nwrapping up the NFC's top seed last week. Baby Warner is due in March.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad",
