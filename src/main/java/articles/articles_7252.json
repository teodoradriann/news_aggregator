    "text": "Actress Ashley Judd has described it as “unfair to survivors” after a court overturned Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 conviction for rape.\nDouble Jeopardy star Judd, who was among the first women to make allegations on the record against Weinstein, is also a campaigner on women’s rights.\nWhile sharing an article that stated that Weinstein’s 23-year sentence for rape had been overturned in an Instagram story, Judd wrote: “This is unfair to survivors. We Live In Our Truth. We know what happened.”\nAshley Judd was among the first women to make allegations against Harvey Weinstein (Anthony Harvey/PA) Hollywood producer Weinstein is still in prison after being sentenced to 16 years for rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles last year.\nJudd previously alleged she thought she was attending a breakfast hotel meeting in 1997, while filming the thriller Kiss The Girls, when he began pressuring her to give and receive massages and to watch him shower.\nIn a bid to get out of the bathroom, she claims she resorted to striking a deal with him that she would say yes to his advances when she won an Oscar for one of his films.\nSpeaking at a press conference in New York City on Thursday, Judd said: “This today is an act of institutional betrayal.\nHarvey Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in jail last year (PA) “And our institutions betray survivors of male sexual violence, and we need to work within and without the systems to start having what is known as ‘institutional courage’.”\nActivist Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo movement, also spoke at the event and said: “Many people, many survivors and those who love and support survivors probably thought that that original verdict meant that there was going to be a change, that it marked a change, marked a difference in how this justice system was going to move and operate.\n“And I think that we felt, and a lot of us felt, that we were on a road to seeing a different America. And this moment makes it feel like we were wrong.”\nShe added: “What does this mean for the MeToo movement?”\n“I want you to hear this. This is not a blow to the movement. It is a clarion call. And we are prepared to answer that call.”\nAllegations against Weinstein, the once powerful and feared studio boss behind such Oscar winners as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare In Love, ushered in a global #MeToo movement in 2017, where women across the world shared stories of their own experiences with sexual assault.\nIn 2019, the United States District Court in Los Angeles dismissed a sexual harassment claim made by Judd against Weinstein in which she said he defamed her, damaging her career.\nTarana Burke, an activist who started the MeToo movement (Ian West/PA) Mira Sorvino, who previously made allegations against Weinstein and won an Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite, tweeted that she was “disgusted” at the justice system and “horrified”.\nDuring a press conference, Weinstein’s lawyer Arthur Aidala called the Court of Appeal’s ruling “a great day for America”.\n“It may sound like an exaggeration but it’s not, today’s legal ruling is a great day for America because it instils in us the faith that there is a justice system,” he said.\nThe majority decision by the Court of Appeal in New York read that “the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes” and this was “an abuse of judicial discretion”.\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told the PA news agency: “We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault.”",

    "text": "La band crossover brasiliana\nRatos de Porão ha appena annunciato il membro fondatore Jarbas “Jabá” Alves è morto all’età di 60 anni.\nAlves è stato nella band tra il 1981 e il 1993 e si è esibito in tutti gli album tra Crucificados Pelo Sistema nel 1984 e RDP Vivo nel 1992, inclusi Descanse Em Paz (1986), Cada Dia Mais Sujo e Agressivo (1987), Brasil (1989) e Anarcofobia (1991).\nLeggermente meno conosciuti negli Stati Uniti, ma ancora amati in tutto il mondo nei circoli metal e punk, i Ratos de Porão sono acclamati come una delle band crossover originali che uniscono punk e thrash e gettano le basi per l'hardcore e il metalcore. Hanno iniziato e sono rimasti fuori dal Brasile, ma sono stati anche in tournée negli Stati Uniti, in Europa e in altre parti del mondo.\nLa notizia è stata originariamente condivisa su Instagram, dove la band ha postato dicendo: “Descanse em paz amigo Jarbas”, che si traduce in “Riposa in pace, amico Jarbas”.\nAnche Max Cavalera , probabilmente il musicista brasiliano più famoso della musica pesante nel corso della storia, ha reso omaggio dicendo:\n“Descanse em paz irmão Jaba Xoba !!! Riposa in pace fratello Jaba.\"\nFinora, la causa della morte di Jabá non è stata rivelata, ma ha avuto problemi al fegato per gran parte della sua vita, quindi questa potrebbe essere probabilmente la ragione per cui è morto. Dopo aver lasciato la band negli anni '90, il cantante João Gordo intervenne e si unì al gruppo.\nJabá ha anche\nlottato con problemi di dipendenza mentre era nella band, e se ne è andato poco prima che pubblicassero il loro album di testi interamente in inglese del 1994, Just Another Crime in Massacreland .\nI nostri pensieri sono rivolti agli amici e alla famiglia di Jabá mentre apprendono la sua perdita.\nIl post\nIl bassista originale dei Ratos de Porão Jarbas “Jabá” Alves morto a 60 anni è apparso per la prima volta su MetalSucks .",

    "text": "Contrasting Claims on Women's Rights in Taliban-Ruled Afghanistan\nRohit Sharma Guides India to Victory in Historic Double Super Over\nA cricket match that was a spectacle on all fronts unfolded at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as India faced Afghanistan in the third T20I. Marked by a top-order collapse, a remarkable recovery, two Super Overs, and a series victory, the match was a rollercoaster ride that kept spectators on the edge of their seats.\nRohit Sharma’s Unforgettable Knock\nIn a surprising turn of events, Captain Rohit Sharma, after two consecutive ducks, found himself steering the Indian innings from a precarious 22/4. Sharma, with his back against the wall, crafted a masterful 61-ball 121 not out, becoming the most successful century maker in T20Is with his fifth century. His performance was not just about the runs, but the timing and the situation, which made it even more special. Alongside him, Rinku Singh made a significant contribution, scoring a quickfire 69 off 39 balls, helping India to reach a formidable 212/4.\nUnprecedented Super Over Drama\nThe match was far from over, as an extraordinary conclusion ensued with not one, but two Super Overs – a first in international cricket. The first Super Over ended in a thrilling tie at 16 runs each, setting the stage for a second decider. India, under pressure, managed to secure the second one, scoring 11/2 compared to Afghanistan’s 1/2, thus securing a nail-biting 10-run victory.\nLooking Ahead: World Cup Preparations\nThe series served as a testing ground for team composition ahead of the World Cup. Despite the initial top-order collapse, the performance of players like Rinku Singh and Yashasvi Jaiswal provided glimpses of India’s bench strength. However, it was Rohit’s stellar century and astute captaincy that may have tilted the ongoing debate about the team’s lineup in his favour.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/ghana-reports-significant-decline-in-childhood-mortality-rates-a-step-towards-improved-health-outcomes/",

    "text": "India to maintain growth velocity in 2024: Assocham “India’s macro picture looks convincing with the economy following a trend growth of seven per cent with critical building blocks combining to give it brighter prospects,’ Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said. NEW DELHI: India is likely to remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world in 2024 on the back of strong consumer demand leading to a pick up in investment across sectors such as construction, hospitality and infrastructure including railways and aviation, Assocham said on Thursday. India retained the tag of the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with its GDP expanding by a faster-than-expected rate of 7.6 per cent in the July-September quarter on booster shots from government spending and manufacturing. The country’s Gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.6 per cent beat most estimates, including 6.5 per cent projected by the RBI. The growth compares to 6.2 per cent in the same quarter last year and 7.8 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter, official data showed. India’s GDP growth beat China’s 4.9 per cent rise in July-Sept, while the Western economies are getting crushed under high-interest rates and energy prices. “India’s macro picture looks convincing with the economy following a trend growth of seven per cent with critical building blocks combining to give it brighter prospects,’ Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said. According to the industry body, India Inc led by financials, construction, hotels, aviation, automobile and other manufacturing areas like electronics are on a strong pitch to further improve performance in the coming year.",

    "title": "Several healthy diet patterns are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes regardless of ethnicity - shows meta-analysis of more than 800,000 people | EurekAlert!",
    "text": "A large new meta-analysis of more than 800,000 participants to be presented at this year’s Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (15-19 September) shows that high adherence to three well-established healthy eating patterns is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, regardless of one’s ethnicity. The study is led by PhD student and Gates Cambridge Scholar Ms Jia Yi Lee, Professor Nita Forouhi, and colleagues from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, UK.\nThe study investigated three healthy dietary patterns: the Mediterranean Diet, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). All three have been recommended for general health and their potential to reduce chronic disease risk.\nThrough a systematic search of published studies, the authors identified 33 publications reporting the association between these dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes. When all the available evidence was combined, the results showed that people who were in the top 10% for adherence to each dietary pattern had significantly lower risks of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the 10% lowest adherence : a 17% lower risk for the Mediterranean Diet, a 21% lower risk for AHEI, and a 23% lower risk for the DASH diet. Importantly, the potential benefits of these dietary patterns did not appear to vary significantly across African, Asian, European, and Hispanic ethnic groups, despite known ethnic differences in dietary culture, as well as diabetes risk.\nWhile some of the lowered risks did not reach statistical significance among Hispanics and mixed ethnic groups, this may be due to the limited data available from non-European ethnic groups in existing studies. Over one-third of the data included in this analysis came from people of European descent, highlighting the need for more research from underrepresented populations.\nThe authors conclude: “Although more research is needed in specific populations, this study strengthens the evidence that the Mediterranean, AHEI, and DASH dietary patterns may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes across diverse ethnic groups, and that they can be promoted across all populations.”\nThis analysis is part of a larger ongoing review examining the associations of various dietary patterns, including plant-based dietary patterns (that include vegetarian and vegan diets) with type 2 diabetes risk. The researchers will further determine whether similar benefits extend across ethnic groups for these other dietary patterns.\nMs Jia Yi Lee, MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK E) JiaYi.Lee@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk (note Ms Lee is currently in Singapore, 7 hours ahead of UK time)\nProfessor Nita Forouhi, MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK E) nita.forouhi@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk\nAlternative contact: Paul Browne in the MRC Epidemiology Unit Comms Team: E) paul.browne@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk\nAlternative contact: Tony Kirby in the EASD Press Office T) +44 7834 385827 E)\ntony.kirby@tonykirby.com\nNotes to editors:\nFigure available in link to full abstract",

Por otro lado, tormentas y lluvias pondrán en riesgo a Guadalajara, Lérida, Tarragona, Castellón, Teruel, Barcelona y Gerona, aunque en el caso de las cuatro últimas ascenderá a naranja por tormentas. Las olas activarán el aviso amarillo en Gerona y Menorca lo estará por rissagas. Finalmente, en las Islas Canarias, Gran Canaria, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro y Tenerife estarán en alerta por fenómenos costeros, y solo Gran Canaria por altas temperaturas. La jornada estará marcada por la posibilidad de tormentas en la mitad noreste, siendo más probables y localmente fuertes en Pirineos e Ibérica, así como por las temperaturas significativamente elevadas en la mitad sur, interior sureste, Cataluña y sur de Gran Canaria, aunque habrá un descenso localmente notable de las máximas en el Ebro.

En cuanto a las temperaturas, descenderán en general en la Península y Baleares, acusadamente las máximas en zonas del nordeste peninsular y se esperan pocos cambios en Canarias. Pese a los descensos, seguirán superándose los 35º C en interiores de la mitad sur y depresiones del nordeste peninsular, sin descartar puntos de Mallorca y sur de las islas Canarias, incluso los 40ºC en zonas del Guadalquivir y las mínimas tampoco bajarán de 25ºC en el área mediterránea.
