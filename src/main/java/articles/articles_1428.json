    "text": "MADRID, 13 (EUROPA PRESS)\nEl sindicato de los trabajadores de Boeing en en la región de Seattle (EE.UU.) ha convocado una huelga por primera vez en 16 años y ha rechazado la oferta del fabricante para subir un 25% los salarios.\nSegún recoge DPA, el 94,65% de los trabajadores votaron que no a la oferta que lanzó Boeing para evitar los paros, que contemplaba una subida salarial del 25% en cuatro años, mejorar en las coberturas sanitarias y las jubilaciones, dado que el sindicato IAM había pedido inicialmente un incremento del 40% en los salarios. Además, el 96% apoyó la convocatoria de huelga.\nLa huelga ha comenzado a las 00.00 hora local de este viernes para unos 30.000 trabajadores. Los representantes sindicales han señalado en una rueda de prensa recogida por 'Bloomberg' que los puntos del acuerdo no eran lo suficientemente buenos y que la oferta no compensaba los 16 años de estancamiento salarial, el aumento de los gastos sanitarios y la deslocalización de miles de empleos sindicales.\nPor su parte, Boeing ha emitido un comunicado en el que muestra su compromiso para restablecer la relación con los trabajadores y el sindicato, además de volver a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo.\nBoeing atraviesa una crisis de reputación, de seguridad y económica desde 2019, cuando dos aviones 737 MAX sufrieron accidentes fatales. Tras esto, se han producido otros incidentes, como la caída de una parte del fuselaje de un avión de Alaska Airlines a principios de este año.",

    "text": "There was a stunning display of colour on Thursday night as the Northern Lights put on a show.\nAccording to BBC Weather, it was the strongest and most widespread exhibition of the phenomenon in the UK since May.\nHowever, we are unlikely to get such a show in the Midlands on Friday, as solar activity is expected to weaken.\nHere are some of the best examples of photos from across the region.\nsabphotos69 / BBC Weather Watchers Enville, Staffordshire Otto the dog / BBC Weather Watchers Walsall Josh / BBC Weather Watchers Malvern, Worcestershire From about 19:00 BST many people were able to see the Northern Lights, also called the aurora borealis.\nNot everyone in the region could see the display, which was often clearer on cameras than with the naked eye.\nThe phenomenon is caused when charged particles from the sun hit gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the North poles.\nJack March / BBC Weather Watchers Stockingford, Warwickshire Eric / BBC Weather Watchers Bloxwich Andrew Fusek Peters Walcot Lake, Shropshire Views of the northern Lights have become more common in the UK in recent years.\nHow far south they can be seen is determined by the level of solar activity.\nThe lowest part of an aurora is typically 50 miles (80 km) above the Earth's surface. The highest part could be 150 miles (800km) above the Earth.\nPhil Harrison / BBC Weather Watchers Worcester Snaphappydave / BBC Weather Watchers Kinver, Staffordshire Thursday night's display was caused by a G5 solar storm - the highest on the 1-5 scale.\nBut such storms can also interfere with satellites and power grids around the world.\nThe Northern Lights have been visible several times during the year.\nIf you want to take photos of them, meteorologists advise using a long exposure camera.\nGraham's Vista / BBC Weather Watchers Sutton Coldfield CaineWolf / BBC Weather Watchers Wolverhampton We love to feature your photographs from across the West Midlands.\nUpload your images via BBC Weather Watchers or email us at midlandstoday@bbc.co.uk .\nFor inspiration, view some top tips from three of England's Big Picture photographers.\nFollow for more pictures on Instagram from BBC Birmingham , BBC Coventry & Warwickshire , BBC Hereford & Worcester , BBC Shropshire , BBC Stoke & Staffordshire and BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country .\nMore on this story Northern Lights shimmer over UK in stunning photos Eyes to the skies for Northern Lights spectacle What are the Northern Lights?

    "text": "The wife of an allegedly murdered Queensland man has shared her heartbreak in a touching online tribute.\nZdravko Bilic, 57, was found stabbed to death in the front yard of his Napalle St home in Warana on the Sunshine Coast.\nBilic was found just after 7.30pm on Monday with two stab wounds to his abdomen, police said.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nHis wife, Gry Tomte, runs a popular skincare clinic in Melbourne’s St Kilda and was interstate at the time.\nShe had contacted a neighbour to check in on Bilic when he couldn’t be reached.\n“There is no way I can capture the immense grief I feel over losing the most beautiful man,” Tomte said.\n“My world for 28 years.”\nTomte said Bilic was “so much more than the beauty mogul’s husband”.\n“He was my everything.”\nA tribute site was set up for friends and family on Thursday, with more than 100 posts added within three hours of its creation.\n“The circumstances surrounding his death make it even more heartbreaking,” one post read.\n“I can’t even begin to imagine the pain you’re carrying right now,” said another.\n“Please know I’m holding you close in my thoughts and sending you all my love and an abundance of strength to help you through these impossible days.”\nIn a statement released by police on her behalf, Tomte said the void Bilic leaves behind is “unbearable”.\n“From the moment we met, both of us living away from family in the new country we had fallen in love with, we knew instantly we were each other’s person.\n“We were complete opposites, and together we made a whole.\n“People say I’m the strong one but I could only be strong because he allowed me to be, and because he wrapped his arms around me daily to make sure I could.”\nBilic was an avid soccer fan and supporter of Melbourne Victory, and youth coach at Ginger Sports, Tomte said.\n“He was loved by more people than I can put into words,” she said.\n“He will be missed by the children, who are constantly asking for him and looking forward to seeing him.\n“If you’ve had the privilege of being in Zed’s presence, you’ll know that he was literal sunshine.\n“And the world is a little less bright without him in it.”\nA 15-year-old boy from West Woombye and a 17-year-old boy from Beerwah have been charged with murder after what police described as a disturbance at the home.\nThey are due to appear at Maroochydore Children’s Court on Thursday.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information or security vision from the area between 11pm on July 13 and 7.35pm on July 14 is urged to contact police.\nStream free on",
