    "text": "A North Carolina father's quick actions and knowledge of CPR saved his 2-year-old daughter's life after she almost drowned in the family's pool over Memorial Day weekend. The Gastonia Police Department said that one family's Memorial Day cookout took a turn for the worse after the family's two-year-old daughter, named Mila, fell into the pool without a flotation device. Home surveillance footage showed the critical moment when family and friends rushed to provide assistance to the young child, who quickly began drowning. \\\"My 10-year-old daughter is screaming out my youngest daughter's name.

    "title": "6 easy ways to nudge yourself closer to a net zero lifestyle",
    "text": "By Yolanthe Fawehinmi ,\n56 minutes ago\nThere are various ways we can try to help the planet, including supporting the drive towards net zero.\nThe goal is to reach a balance between the carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere and the amount of carbon removed from it – and Net Zero Week (July 6-12) puts this very issue in the spotlight, highlighting how global industries, businesses, policy-makers and academics can aid in these goals.\nWhile widescale action at those levels is key, what can individuals do to help reduce carbon emissions in their own lives?\n1. Turn devices off when not in use\nAccording to Kelly Becker, president of UK & Ireland , Belgium & Netherlands at Schneider Electric , things like heating and running a shower or hot bath is what consumes most energy at home – but every little helps when it comes to reducing energy usage. “That’s the biggest drain on our energy bills. However, we can economise by turning devices off before we go to bed or while we’re at work,” says Becker.\n2. Instal smart temperature controls\nUltimately, the cheapest energy is the energy you don’t use – and this is better news for the environment too.\n“That’s why you should think about installing smart temperature controls for both heating and cooling to help save money and reduce carbon emissions.For example, using smart thermostats to control the temperature for individual rooms, alongside smart mode settings, can save you up to £420 a year,” says Becker.\n“We recently asked 2000 UK consumers questions about saving energy at home and found that 68% want to install smart thermostats. Smart home technologies can learn your routines and provide you with intel that lets you cut energy waste. They can also be programmed to manage heating and lighting automatically, or you can control everything yourself via a smartphone app.”\nFor Becker, smart plugs connected to electrical devices, kitchen appliances, white goods, and indoor and outdoor lighting, can save you over 30% on your energy bill.\n“Now is as good a time as any to start making energy-efficient improvements in the home,” she adds. “There is a strong appetite for these home improvements amongst consumers. We also discovered that 35% have already replaced older light bulbs with LED lights, which are now cheaper to buy and use significantly less energy.”\n3. Set goals\nDenise Johansson, co-founder and co-CEO of Enfuce, suggests making greener choices part of your spending goals. This might be being more mindful of purchases and researching sustainable brands.\n“It all boils down to making a few smart choices about how you spend your money and what you spend it on,” says Johansson. “Let’s get real, making changes to our habits takes commitment. That’s why setting up a plan, a fun challenge or mapping out the goals we want to crush can be extremely motivating and can keep us on track.”\n4. Choose more sustainable transportation\nDitching your car for public transport, walking or cycling is an easy way to cut down your carbon footprint, stay healthy and get closer to a net zero lifestyle. Fewer cars on the roads mean less pollution, and you can skip the hassle of traffic and parking.\n“Enfuce’s latest research with Deedster, the climate action app, revealed that daily commutes make up around 13% of people’s total carbon emissions, outweighing both food and shopping. So, finding more sustainable ways of transport is a simple yet impactful action you can take to reduce your carbon footprint,” says Johansson.\n5. Embrace a plant-based diet\nIf you don’t want to go fully vegan, Monika Liikamaa, fellow co-founder and co-CEO of Enfuce, suggests giving things like ‘meatless Mondays’ a go.\n“Reducing your meat intake can seriously slash your carbon footprint. Load up on delicious plant-based meals and opt for local, seasonal produce for extra eco-points,” says Liikamaa. “You can also opt to eat at home instead of out at a restaurant, and use the money you save to purchase healthy, environmentally-friendly produce to use to cook up a storm.” 6. Educate yourself and your community\nLiikamaa adds: “Knowledge is literally power. Most people have no idea how their everyday actions affect the environment. Learning more about climate change and sustainability, and having real talks with friends, family and colleagues on these topics can help everyone make more environmentally-conscious decisions”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Maltempo in arrivo, pioggia e freddo nel weekend\nArticolo Precedente\nArticolo Successivo\nUna nuova perturbazione atlantica, già in avvicinamento da ovest, porterà un significativo cambiamento meteorologico nel corso del weekend. Sabato 14 dicembre, infatti, una massa di aria instabile raggiungerà la Puglia e la Basilicata, determinando un peggioramento delle condizioni atmosferiche con piogge e temporali, particolarmente intensi nelle prime ore della giornata su Barese, Brindisino, Tarantino e Leccese.\nIl Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, in collaborazione con le regioni coinvolte, ha emesso un avviso di condizioni meteorologiche avverse, sottolineando la necessità di attivare i sistemi di protezione civile nei territori interessati. La perturbazione, che attraverserà l'Italia nelle prossime ore, porterà diffuso maltempo soprattutto al centro-sud, con piogge sparse o pioviggini e qualche nevicata tra le aree montuose.\nIn particolare, tra la sera di oggi e la giornata di domani, è attesa una fase di spiccata instabilità sulla Campania, con estensione ai settori tirrenici di Basilicata e Calabria settentrionale. Le temperature, oscillando attorno ai valori tipici di dicembre, contribuiranno a creare un clima invernale, con possibilità di nevicate nelle zone più alte.\nIl quadro meteorologico delle prossime ore, confermato dai modelli fisico-matematici, prevede dunque un fine settimana caratterizzato da piogge e freddo, rendendo indispensabile l'uso dell'ombrello in diverse aree del Paese.",

Francesco lo ha evidenziato nel suo discorso ai membri della Fondazione Gaudium et Spes, organismo che si occupa di progetti di assistenza sociale e di conservazione culturale con sede a Puerto Rico e nel mondo. Il Papa li ha ricevuti questa mattina, 14 febbraio, a Casa Santa Marta, e nel suo discorso ha rammentato come il documento conciliare, da cui la Fondazione trae il nome, evidenzia “lo spirito sinodale della Chiesa” che si “manifesta nella solidarietà, specialmente verso quanti più soffrono” (Vatican News).\nIl Movimento internazionale dei sacerdoti sposati sottolinea la distanza abissale che esiste tra le affermazioni del Pontefice e la vita reale dentro la Chiesa. ad esempio spesso i preti sposati sono ancora oggi discriminati in molte diocesi del mondo e il loro valido ministero sacerdotale non è consentito dal Diritto Canonico.

    "title": "Nearly half of non-terminally ill Canadians who choose euthanasia say they are lonely - LifeSite",
    "text": "OTTAWA ( LifeSiteNews ) – Official government data shows that about half of Canadians who are not terminally ill yet wanted to end their lives via state-sanctioned assisted suicide did so last year because they said they were lonely. According to data published by Health Canada on December 11 in its fifth annual report on medical assistance in dying (MAID), 15,342 people were approved for and died by euthanasia in 2023. A total of 14,721 of these deaths were in cases where illness or disability were likely down the road or considered “reasonably foreseeable.” These are called Track 1 MAiD deaths. However, 662 deaths were people who were not dying. Of these Track 2 deaths, 47.1 percent cited as reasons for wanting to die “isolation or loneliness.” By comparison, about 21.1 percent of Track 1 deaths reported the same feelings for wanting to die by doctor-led suicide. The report stated that “social isolation and loneliness are shown to have a serious impact on physical and mental health, quality of life, and longevity.” Of the Track 2 deaths, 35.7 percent lived alone, compared with 30.2 percent of Track 1 deaths. Of Track 1 deaths, the average age was 77.7 years. The average age of Track 2 deaths was 75. Of note is that this year’s Health Canada report on MAiD is the first to include so-called “verbal” requests from individuals as official. Previously, those who wanted to die via assisted suicide had to submit a form to Health Canada in order to be officially recorded as a request to die by suicide. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal government legalized MAiD in 2016, the deadly program has continued to relax its rules on who is eligible for death. As reported by LifeSiteNews, 1 in 20 Canadian deaths in 2023 came from assisted suicide. Instances of people being offered MAiD as a solution to their health issues have become commonplace in Canada, as reported by LifeSiteNews. Last week, LifeSiteNews reported how a senior Canadian couple said that a hospice care center presented euthanasia to one of them as an option because they could not afford increased care costs on their fixed income. Canadian pro-life leaders have criticized the Trudeau government’s continued push for expanding MAiD. Indeed, most Canadians fear the nation’s euthanasia regime unfairly targets those who are financially and socially vulnerable while still supporting the immoral practice in general. In 2021, the program expanded from killing only terminally ill patients to allowing the chronically ill to qualify. Since then, the government has sought to include those suffering solely from mental illness. The number of Canadians killed by lethal injection under the nation’s MAiD program since 2016 stands at close to 65,000, with an estimated 16,000 deaths in 2023 alone. Many fear that because the official statistics are manipulated the number may be even higher. Canada had approximately 15,280 euthanasia deaths in 2023.",

    "title": "Environmental groups sue Hobbs, state water agency over San Pedro flow",
    "text": "Environmental groups sue Hobbs, state water agency over development near San Pedro River Environmental groups on Thursday sued Gov. Katie Hobbs and the state water resources director, demanding that they review and revoke the water certificate of a proposed commercial and residential project in Sierra Vista that the groups say imperils the San Pedro River. The project of nearly 7,000 homes is stalled after the developer, Castle and Cook Inc., pulled out late last year. If it were built, the Center for Biological Diversity and San Pedro 100 argued in the lawsuit, it would diminish the San Pedro River's flow, hurting critical habitat for wildlife. The groups sued Hobbs and Arizona Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Buschatzke for failing to review the 100-year designation of adequate water supply given to Pueblo del Sol Water Company for the project known as Tribute. That certificate of adequacy was issued over 10 years ago but was [contested from the start](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2018/08/09/arizona-court-ruling-clears-way-development-near-san-pedro-river/948915002/). Congress designated a section of the San Pedro River as a federal conservation area 36 years ago. The riparian area is a refuge for biodiversity in the arid Southwest and draws national interest to protect this remnant of river life. The designation gave the Bureau of Land Management power to claim [water rights to protect the river](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/10/30/san-pedro-river-federal-water-rights/71161641007/) and its biodiversity. Conservation groups said regulators knew once the river's water rights were quantified, it would impact certificates of water adequacy for new development. The water department issued a water certificate anyway and [said it could revoke the permission](https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/2014/04/16/help-embattled-san-pedro-river/7765741/) later if Pueblo del Sol's pumping violated water rights. Both the development company, Castle and Cooke, and Pueblo del Sol are owned by billionaire David H. Murdock, who has other two housing developments in Sierra Vista. \"(Pueblo del Sol wells) are already stealing water that belongs to the San Pedro River National Conservation Area,\" said Robin Silver, co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity, who is leading the lawsuit. Water law maintains a \"first in time, first in right\" doctrine, which means that water users who came after the conservation area was created have less priority. A judge last year quantified how much water the conservation area was entitled to, giving conservation groups and federal agencies a tool to demand reduced groundwater pumping from newer users. Tribute does not have a century-worth of water if the state accounts for the river's rights, the lawsuit asserts. \"ADWR has the responsibility to review those certificates when the conditions change,\" Silver said. That change happened a year ago with the water rights quantification, and he wants to force the water department and the governor to act. Less than two months ago, the groups filed a similar lawsuit against Hobbs and Buschatzke for failing to consider an Active Management Area, stringent [groundwater regulation](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/06/25/conservation-groups-sue-arizona-gov-hobbs-over-san-pedro-river/74205813007/), in the Upper San Pedro River basin. The state water agency said it would not comment on pending litigation. Imperiled waterway: [Environmental groups seek groundwater protections around Arizona's San Pedro River](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/09/22/the-san-pedro-river-is-a-threatened-desert-oasis-conservationists-say/70936159007/) An abandoned project The ambitious development project in Sierra Vista is already facing an uncertain future. The city approved it in 2006, but after nearly 20 years of planning, Castle and Cooke never broke ground. Last year, the developer announced it was pulling out of the project permanently. The announcement came not long after a judge quantified the conservation area's water rights, but the company said its decision was financial and that it would focus its investment on California and Hawaii projects. Tribute's development plan, east of State Route 92 and about 5 miles from the river included a maximum of 6,959 single- and multi-family units, plus offices, shopping stores, and community parks. The city also identified potential land plots for a fire and police station, and a branch library, according to a 2014 development plan. Sierra Vista Mayor Clea McCaa told Arizona Public Media last year that the city is working with Castle and Cooke to market the property so that other developers can come and take over the work. A buyer would inherit an \"immensely valuable\" certificate of adequate water supply for the project, said Silver. The project could also face legal challenges—and litigation costs—to prove that pumping would not interfere with the river water rights and that there is 100 years' worth of water. Riparian areas: [On Arizona's San Pedro River, hummingbirds reflect the health of a landscape](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/06/30/san-pedro-river-arizona-water-hummingbirds/70184907007/) Many users and a dragging legal case The quantified water rights of the conservation area will definitely affect the housing market, said Rhett Larson, a professor of water law and senior research fellow with the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. The court order that quantified the conservation area's water rights was not challenged by the January 2024 deadline. BLM filed for a decree, which is the last step to assert the water right. But it could still be hard to enforce. Other users' water rights have not been quantified or given a priority, said Larson. The San Pedro River adjudication is a small piece in a much larger legal case that seeks to adjudicate water rights to the Gila River and its tributaries. While many water users began pumping groundwater after the 1988 conservation area was declared, there are others that have higher seniority. The U.S. Army's Fort Huachuca, which has been the target of Center for Biological Diversity lawsuits for years, was built in 1877 during the campaign against Chiricahua Apaches. Silver recognized the Fort has seniority over the conservation area's water rights, but he added they also have to abide by the Endangered Species Act. \"So even though they have senior rights in Fort Huachuca, they can't continue to suck the river dry,\" he said. But there is a long list of water users, in the Upper San Pedro River basin and other Arizona rivers, whose water rights have not been quantified or given a priority. This could create more legal issues down the road. \"This case is a really good example of why the state of Arizona needs to invest in expediting and finishing the general stream adjudications,\" Larson said. \"Because as long as they go on, it's difficult for us to know who owns which water rights, and it's difficult for us to protect our water supplies because there is so much uncertainty.\" Clara Migoya covers agriculture and water issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

    "text": "Syria's air defense units repel Israeli aggression near Damascus\nIran Press TV\nFriday, 29 December 2023 6:13 AM\nSyrian air defenses have intercepted most Israeli missiles near the country's capital city of Damascus, amid an upsurge in the regime's acts of aggression against the Arab nation following the bloody onslaught against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\"At around 11:55 p.m. local time (2055 GMT) on Thursday, the Israeli enemy carried out an aerial attack from the direction of the occupied Golan Heights, and targeted a number of sites in the southern flank of Damascus,\" the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) quoted an unnamed military source as saying.\nThe source added that Syrian air defenses shot down most of the missiles.\nThe report noted that there were no injuries in the strike, but there were material losses.\nThe strike comes a day after Damascus International Airport reopened following repeated Israeli strikes.\nIsrael waged the bloody war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian Hamas resistance movement launched Operation al-Aqsa Storm in the occupied territories in retaliation for the Tel Aviv regime's incessant crimes against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\nSince the start of the aggression, the Tel Aviv regime has killed 21,320 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and injured more than 55,600 others.\nIt has also imposed a \"complete siege\" on the coastal sliver, cutting off fuel, electricity, food and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.\nIsrael frequently targets military positions inside Syria, especially those of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah which has played a key role in helping the Syrian army in its fight against foreign-backed terrorists.\nThe Tel Aviv regime rarely comments on its attacks on Syrian territories, which many see as a knee-jerk reaction to the Syrian government's success in confronting and decimating terrorism.\nIsrael has been one of the main supporters of terrorist groups that oppose the democratically-elected government of President Bashar al-Assad since the foreign-backed militancy erupted in Syria.\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list\n|\n|",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: On the second day of the first Test between Pakistan and Bangladesh in Rawalpindi, the hosts declared their innings at 448/6, with Mohammad Rizwan just 29 runs short of a double century. Rizwan remained unbeaten on 171 off 239 balls, partnering with vice-captain Saud Shakeel, who scored 141, to build a commanding position for Pakistan. The declaration decision by captain Shan Masood, which came before Rizwan could achieve his double century, sparked debate among fans.Social media was abuzz with fans expressing their disappointment that Rizwan was denied the rare feat of a double century. Many believed that Masood should have allowed Rizwan more time, given the strong platform established by the 240-run partnership between Rizwan and Shakeel for the fifth wicket.— jalali_amit (@jalali_amit) — Hesy_R0ck (@Hesy_R0ck) — AhmadRehanKhan (@AhmadRehanKhan) In the post-day press conference, Saud Shakeel explained the team’s decision.\\\"See, as far as Rizwan bhai's double century is concerned, I don't think there was any haste in taking the decision to declare the innings,\\\" Shakeel stated. \\\"Rizwan bhai was clearly told an hour before that we would be declaring at this point in time. So, he had an idea of when we would declare. He was told we would try to get near 450 before declaring.\\\"— imransiddique89 (@imransiddique89) Shakeel emphasized that the decision was strategic and communicated well in advance. He highlighted the importance of the team's position over individual milestones.\\\"We wanted to ensure we had enough runs on the board to put pressure on Bangladesh and set ourselves up for a win,\\\" Shakeel added.Pakistan are now in a strong position, and Bangladesh face a substantial first-innings deficit and an uphill battle in the remainder of the match.",
