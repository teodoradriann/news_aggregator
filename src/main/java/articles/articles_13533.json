    "text": "Jeannie Mai became frustrated after discovering her personal property was stored in damaged boxes by her ex-husband Jeezy and In Touch has the exclusive bodycam footage of the incident.\nIn Touch obtained bodycam footage of Jeannie’s encounter with police on December 9, 2024.\nJeannie, 46, arrived at Jeezy’s home in Georgia to pick up her items, including her clothing, Emmy and photos that she left behind after they split. She showed up with her assistant and had a moving truck on the way.\nJeannie called the police after Jeezy, 47, instructed his team to not allow her inside the home.\nJeannie Mai Calls Police in Fight With Ex-Husband Jeezy Over Property She claimed the court order allowed her to do a walk through to check for any items, but Jeezy did not want her inside the property.\nThe rapper filed an emergency motion requesting the court order that allowed Jeannie to pick up her items be modified to restrict her from entering. However, Jeannie showed up at the home before the judge ruled on his request.\nJeezy, who was not home, did allow his team to walk Jeannie to the garage, where he had her boxes stored. Jeannie was not happy when Jeezy’s house manager finally allowed her into the garage.\nJeannie Mai Accuses Jeezy of ‘Harassment’ After He Subpoenas Bank Records The house manager had Jeezy’s lawyer on speaker phone during the exchange. In the bodycam footage, Jeannie can be heard asking the house manager, “This is my stuff right here? Like this?”\nJeannie told Jeezy’s lawyer, “I just want you to know as I’m looking through some of the boxes are damaged with the clothing completely exposed . It’s damp in here. I just want you to be aware of that.”\nThe police walked out of the garage while Jeannie and the lawyer continued their back and forth.\nJeannie can be heard telling Jeezy’s lawyer, “The box is damaged. The clothing is exposed. The garage is damp. That’s what I wanted to tell you.”\nJeannie could be heard telling the house manager and Jeezy’s lawyer, “Let’s like make sure … make sure about having respect for a woman’s belongings.” Jeannie said she always showed Jeezy’s property respect.\nThe police took a report of the dispute for Jeannie, but were unable to force Jeezy or his team to allow her inside the home. In court documents, Jeannie described the state she found her boxes.\n“The boxes were wet, with water having soaked through the boxes, damaging personal items. There were mouse traps set in the garage, presumably set for mice which had eaten through some of the boxes,” Jeannie’s lawyer wrote. “Many of [Jeannie’s] awards were broken and scratched.”\nJeezy’s lawyer told Jeannie that they would have to resolve the matter in court.\nAs In Touch first reported, in his emergency motion, Jeezy claimed he did not “feel safe” with his ex-wife being allowed to roam around his home.\n“[Jeezy] does not feel safe having [Jeannie] in his home. Given [Jeannie’s] history of attempting to destroy [Jeezy’s] career with misleading information, [Jeezy] would have no way of knowing if [Jeannie] is planting listening devices or cameras in his home,” his lawyer said.\nJeezy Slams Ex Jeannie Mai's 'Frivolous' Accusations Amid Legal Battle Jeezy’s lawyer added, “[Jeannie] is angry about the parties divorce and she is revengeful. In addition, the mere presence of [Jeannie] inside [Jeezy’s] home and personal space, after the highly contested nature of the divorce case, would absolutely destroy [Jeezy’s] peace and tranquility, as well as invade his privacy.”\nJeannie scoffed at Jeezy’s claims. She denied being revengeful or angry about the split. Her lawyer wrote, “The only party that seems to be angry or revengeful is [Jeezy].” The case is ongoing.\nCrosswords Celebrity Crossword 131 Play now A source close to Jeannie tells In Touch , “[Jeannie] been trying to get her stuff for over a year. She wants this to be over with and he won’t resolve.”\nJeannie and Jeezy wed in 2021. They split in September 2023 and their divorce was finalized in June 2024.",

    "text": "Assoc.Prof.Dr Neak Chandarith, Director of the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy under the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), told the Vietnam News Agency that Lam’s visits to Laos and Cambodia, his first overseas trips since he took office, demonstrate Vietnam’s strategic priority of developing ties with the neighbouring countries in its foreign policy. The Cambodia visit will create a chance for the leader to engage in discussions at the highest level, contributing to enhancing the Vietnam – Cambodia relations and cooperation across various domains, he said, adding both sides will exchange their views on and seek solutions to issues of mutual concerns. That the Vietnamese President will lay wreaths at the Independence Monument and the Cambodia – Vietnam Friendship Monument nearby affirms the country’s respect for its traditional and historical relations with Cambodia, the official said. He went on to say Lam’s visit also aims at bolstering the people-to-people exchanges and the people-to-people diplomacy, helping promote mutual understanding between the two peoples, stressing that Vietnam and Cambodia have worked to preserve their sound neightbourliness, comprehensive cooperation, and time-tested friendship over the past years. The Cambodian scholar said the two sides should maintain regular delegation exchanges at all levels and set up dialogue mechanisms to discuss priorities and share practical experience, while stepping up collaboration in such domains as economy, science, technology and innovation, education and training, climate change response, energy, environment, and health care.",

Miller, Raven program manager for the 315th Security Forces Squadron, received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts as part of Operation Allies Refuge, during which he helped firsthand to evacuate hundreds of people from Afghanistan. The Distinguished Flying Cross is presented to persons who distinguish themselves by single acts of heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight. The medal was presented by 315th Airlift Wing Commander Col. Stephen Lanier. Ravens are specially trained Security Forces personnel dedicated to providing force protection for Mobility Air Force aircraft transiting through austere locations with potentially high terrorist and criminal threat levels. “It’s a specialized mission, you go with the aircraft and make sure that there is adequate security for that aircraft and its personnel,” said Miller. Miller highlighted the fact that the experience underscored the need to always be ready for rapid global deployment at any time. “Being in the Reserve, we are the first to deploy and we can get called up at a moment’s notice,” he continued. “So it is critical to mission success to be fit to fight.” Operation Allies Refuge was an evacuation effort carried out by the United States during the 2021 Taliban offensive. It took place in the final weeks of the war in Afghanistan and saw the airlifting of certain at-risk Afghan civilians (particularly coalition-allied interpreters), employees of the American embassy in Kabul, and other prospective applicants for the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa. American personnel also helped NATO and other regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the capital city of Kabul. The operation was concurrent with the broader American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the multinational evacuation of eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans.

    "title": "In Setback For Siddaramaiah, Karnataka Bill To Tax Temples Defeated",
    "text": "Siddaramaiah said allegations regarding the amendments to the bill \"appear to be misrepresented\". In a setback for the Congress-led government in Karnataka, a bill that mandated a 10 per cent tax on the income of temples that have revenues of more than Rs 1 crore was defeated in the state legislative council late last evening. This comes two days after the bill was passed in the state assembly. The bill sparked a huge controversy in Karnataka with the opposition BJP accusing the Congress of implementing 'Anti-Hindu' policies. The National Democratic Alliance led by the BJP has more numbers than the ruling government in the legislative council or Upper House in Karnataka. The Congress has 30 MLCs, BJP has 35, eight MLCs are from the JD(S) and there is one independent candidate. One seat is vacant in the council. The Karnataka government passed 'Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment Amendment Bill 2024' that mandates the state to collect 10 per cent tax from temples that have revenues exceeding Rs 1 crore and 5 pe rcent from those with revenues ranging between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. After flak regarding the government's amendments to the bill, state ministers Ramalinga Reddy and Dinesh Gundu Rao defended the move and criticised the BJP for its opposition to it. Minister for Transport, Ramalinga Reddy alleging that BJP is \"anti-Hindu\" claimed that the party which was in power in 2011 had made the amendments to the bill. \"We are not anti-Hindu. Actually, the BJP is anti-Hindu. This Act came into existence in 2003. In 2011, they made some amendments. At that time, up to Rs 5 lakh, there were about 34,000 temples - they did not give any money for Dharmika Parishad. From Rs 5 Lakhs to Rs 10 Lakhs, there are about 193 'B grade' temples - they have to give 5 per cent. More than Rs 10 Lakhs, there are about 205 temples - they have to give 10 per cent. They approved this amendment in 2011 in the Assembly. Who is anti-Hindu? BJP,\" he said. Minister for Health Dinesh Gundu Rao said that the BJP should realise the bill is for the benefit of the temples, alleging that when the government is trying to help smaller temples, the BJP is trying to mislead. After the bill was cleared in the lower house of the state, former Chief Minister and BJP veteran BS Yediyurappa questioned why only Hindu temples are being scrutinized and not the incomes of other religions. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the allegations regarding the amendments to the bill \"appear to be misrepresented\", \"aiming only at misleading the public\" and \"polarizing people along communal lines for political leverage.\"",

    "text": "Pruebas. El líder de Morena en la capital, Sebastián Ramírez, expuso una boleta que fue anulada y era un voto por Caty Monreal en la alcaldía Cuauhtémoc. La posible sobrerrepresentación de Morena y aliados en la próxima integración de la Cámara de Diputados generó alerta entre expertos, partidos y consejeros del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE). Mientras analistas ven la posibilidad de que Morena, PT y PVEM obtengan una mayoría calificada en la Cámara de Diputados de manera artificial y con rebase del tope constitucional, los partidos de Sigamos Haciendo Historia señalan que la ley les permite la sobrerrepresentación, la oposición pide que se ponga lupa en ese tema y la autoridad electoral señala que es muy temprano para discutir ese tema. Expertos coincidieron en que la coalición legislativa de Morena, PT y PVEM podrían obtener una sobrerrepresentación de 18% en la Cámara de Diputados, lo cual es inconstitucional. Con datos preliminares de la jornada electoral, Javier Martín Reyes, investigador del Instituto de Investigaciones Jurídicas de la UNAM, publicó una proyección de la confirmación legislativa de la Cámara de Diputados, en la que los tres partidos rebasarían el tope constitucional de sobrerrepresentación que es de 8%. De acuerdo con los datos, Morena obtuvo 40% de los votos y obtendría 241 curules, de mayoría relativa y plurinominal, con la aplicación del tope máximo de sobrerrepresentación. A su vez, el PT obtuvo 8% de los votos y se sumaría una sobrerrepresentación de 6%, lo que lo dejaría con 72 curules. Por su parte, el PT obtuvo 5% de los votos y se le sumaría un 5% de sobrerrepresentación, lo que lo dejaría con 49 diputados. En total, la coalición Sigamos Haciendo Historia tendría 362 diputados en la proyección presentada por el investigador Javier Martín Reyes, lo que significa mayoría calificada con posibilidad de hacer cambios constitucionales. Aunque por separado Morena, PT y PVEM estarían dentro del límite de 8% de sobrerrepresentación en la Cámara de Diputados, si se toman en cuenta los datos globales de la coalición Sigamos Haciendo Historia, la sobrerrepresentación sería de 18%, lo que se consideraría inconstitucional. “Antes que hablar de fraude -que no es lo mismo que las documentadas irregularidades-, la oposición debería dar la batalla contra la sobrerrepresentación. Como coalición, Morena y aliados tienen una sobrerrepresentación ¡del 18%!”, indicó el experto en sus redes sociales. Por su parte, el exconsejero del INE, Ciro Murayama, coincidió en que en coalición se rebasaría el límite constitucional que pueden tener las fuerzas políticas. “Ésta es la batalla que vale la pena: evitar una sobre representación anticonstitucional que acabe con la democracia. No en inventar fraudes porque hay quien no se explica la derrota”, aseveró Murayama en su cuenta de X. En otro tuit, apuntó que “ahora necesitamos que ese voto bien contado no se altere al traducirlo en curules. El gobierno busca que su 54% del voto ciudadano se vuelva 73% de los diputados. Eso sí sería un fraude. Durante la sesión de instalación de los cómputos distritales, la consejera del INE, Carla Humphrey, consideró que había quien se estaba adelantado con especulaciones sobre la conformación de la Cámara, pues faltan los cómputos distritales y el periodo de impugnaciones por lo que será hasta agosto cuando se de la discusión y análisis sobre la sobrerrepresentación que tendrá cada partido y el INE dará a conocer la integración de la Cámara de Diputados hasta el 23 de ese mes. Por su parte, el consejero Ucc-Kib Espadas manifestó que la ahora oposición, en especial PRI y PAN, se beneficiaron de la sobrerrepresentación legislativa y tuvieron décadas para impulsar un modelo más equitativo, por lo que dijo que se aplicará lo que señala la Constitución. Señaló que en la composición de la Cámara de Diputados y la asignación de plurinominales se aplicará lo que indica la Constitución, que es el tope máximo de 8% de sobrerrepresentación y los inconformes podrán acudir al Tribunal Electoral. Los partidos de oposición, durante la sesión del INE, se pronunciaron por una revisión con lupa durante el proceso de asignación de plurinominales, para evitar que Morena obtenga una mayoría calificada artificial a través del PT y PVEM. Emilio Suárez, representante del PRI, aceptó que el propio sistema y la ley autorizan una sobrerrepresentación, por lo que pidió a los consejeros no aplicar la Constitución literal, sino interpretarla para alcanzar una conformación equitativa en la próxima Cámara de Diputados. Mientras que el representante legislativo del PT, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, dijo: “nosotros no hicimos la ley que hoy se duelen y que fueron favorecidos permanentemente por décadas con una sobrerrepresentación. No la hicimos nosotros, la hizo el PRI y el PAN fundamentalmente”. Análisis La impugnación de la elección presidencial que prepara la alianza Fuerza y Corazón por México es legítima y procedente, aseguró José Perdomo, académico en Derecho Administrativo de la Universidad La Salle, y a la vez criticó la firmeza con la que Xóchitl Gálvez, abanderada del PAN, PRI y PRD, reconoció su derrota en las urnas. “Cuando sale Xóchitl Gálvez a reconocer su derrota, bien, al fin honró su palabra de comprometerse con el resultado de la elección, sin embargo, ahora de repente nos dicen que van a impugnar, correcto, por eso no hay que arriesgarse a aceptar los resultados”, dijo. En entrevista con 24 HORAS, Perdomo indicó que los actores políticos en el país, tienen derecho a exigir a una autoridad superior la revisión de los resultados de una jornada electoral, esto a partir de una argumentación sólida. Asimismo, el especialista en Derecho enfatizó que el Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) se comprometió en abrir 67% de los paquetes electorales presidenciales, por lo que restaría confirmar las inconsistencias señaladas por el PAN, PRI y PRD en la elección. Los dirigentes nacionales del PRI, Alejandro Moreno, actualmente diputado federal y del PAN, Marko Cortés, están en el primer lugar de la lista de plurinominales para el Senado, por lo que a pesar de la baja votación que consiguieron, tienen garantizada su entrada al Congreso. No así el líder del PRD, Jesús Zambrano, que debido a los pocos votos que consiguieron se quedaría el partido sin representación proporcional y solo con los dos escaños conseguidos como primera minoría por José Sabino Herrera Daddug en Tabasco y Araceli Saucedo Reyes en Michoacán.",
