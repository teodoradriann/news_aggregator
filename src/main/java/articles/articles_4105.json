    "text": "Make Holiday Hosting More Peaceful With These Thoughtfully Designed Items\nAs much fun as entertaining during the holiday season can be—twinkling lights! cookie swaps! eggnog!—we’ll be the first to admit that it can be a very stressful time of year, too.\nNavigating the beautiful chaos of the holidays starts with cultivating a comfortable space that also reflects your personal style: think elegant glassware, cozy throws, and dining setups big enough for family and friends. And once you’ve got your own space settled, it becomes easier to know which accessories could simplify hosting for everyone on your gift list.\nWhether you’re gathering for beloved holiday traditions or simply taking a moment for yourself, these timeless designs from [Unison](https://www.unisonhome.com/?utm_content=Dwell_BrandedArticle_Q42024_LearnMore) will make sure all remains calm and bright.\nFreshen up your flatware\nEntertaining is far easier with the essentials on hand—like the right amount of forks. Be sure to splash out on some extra sets of flatware this season. We’re partial to a gold finish; it’s warm and luxurious without being overly flashy, and elevates everything from the classic turkey dinner to Chinese takeout.\nShop the Look\nGreat drinking glasses\nYour famous (or infamous) New Year’s Eve punch deserves a great vessel. Look for well-crafted tumblers to elevate your home bar—ideally something versatile that can serve everything from sparkling water to mulled wine with equal elegance. An amber or smoked glass option keeps it moody and holiday cool.\nA tip-top table\nThe table is the heart of holiday entertaining, of course. You could pull out that folding table that’s been gathering dust in your garage—or you could invite your guests to pull up a chair around something sturdy and stylish. A solid oak number is always a winner, anchoring your dining space with warmth and character year round.\nShop the Look\nAccent pieces with a punch of color\nBelieve it or not, you can embrace festive decor without breaking out the elf-print tea towels. A little bit of color goes a long way when infusing a space with holiday cheer. For instance, a more muted sage-green cake stand can add the perfect amount of holiday magic for your spiced bundt cake (or Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired gingerbread house).\nShop the Look\nChic serving tools\nNothing brings peace, love, and goodwill towards men like a cheese board—and nothing makes your beautiful charcuterie tray more inviting than a great set of cheese knives. A well-designed set can handle everything from creamy bries to aged cheddars.\nShop the Look\nTextiles galore\nFestive throw pillows are the easiest way to transition a space into holiday mode. Opt for rich, seasonal hues or subtle holiday motifs rather than overly kitschy designs. And don’t forget a cozy throw (or two) too—a high-quality blanket is a visual cue to your guests to slow down and stay a while.\nShop the Look\nTouches of texture\nTo create a space with warmth, you’ll want to incorporate materials with warmth too. Whether it’s a metallic gold vase for winter berries or a cork bowl brimming with rustic pine cones, the finishing touches are everything when it comes to cultivating a cozy vibe.\nShop the Look\nSimple, sophisticated storage\nHalf the stress of hosting happens before your guests even walk in the door. Do yourself a favor and invest in floor baskets and artful bins for speedy, stylish storage. They’re the ultimate trick to tossing everything out of sight in a snap before guests ring the doorbell.\nShop the Look\nA better guest bedroom\nIf you’re hosting overnight guests this holiday season, invest in a well-crafted bed frame with clean lines and quality craftsmanship. Not only will it give the in-laws a great night’s sleep (a gift to everyone!), you’ll be able to host guests in style far beyond the holiday season. How’s that for a little comfort and joy?\nShop the Look\nShop the Look\nTimeless gifts\nNow that you’re the host with the most, it’s time to give the gift of effortless entertaining to others: Avoid overly trendy home accessories here—instead, stick with functional pieces that will stand the test of time, like a well-crafted vase, homey mug, or serving set.\nShop the Look\nExplore the entire Holiday Collection at [unisonhome.com](https://www.unisonhome.com/?utm_content=Dwell_BrandedArticle_Q42024_LearnMore).\n[Stacey McLachlanDwell Contributor](/@staceymclachlan)\nPublished\nLast Updated\nGet the Pro Newsletter\nWhat’s new in the design world?

    "text": "Todo San Estanislao de Kostka -Arenal- se emocionó el miércoles 28 de febrero. Y ese día quedará en la retina de dos padres Féliz De Ávila y Belén Pájaro, que lo han dado todo para que su hijo haga realidad sus sueños. El prospecto arenalero Luis De Ávila debutó el miércoles en el Sprint Training con los Bravos de Atlanta.

El zurdo entró en el quinto episodio en auxilio del zurdo Hayden Harris. Al primer bateador que enfrentó en su debut fue nada más y nada menos que a Bryce Harper, a quien dominó con rola a pitcher; luego retiró a Nick Castellanos con ponche.

En el sexto solo colgó un out, recibió 3 hits y una carrera. El mánager Brian Snitker lo relevó por Jonathan Hughes. Para ser su debut podemos decir que fue excepcional, ya que enfrentó a un verdadero ‘carro de leña’, como lo es el linup de los Filis. De Ávila tiene 22 años (nació el 5 de mayo de 2001) y su debut es un vaho de alegría para San Estanislao, una población que respira béisbol desde los años 50, pero que no ha tenido el privilegio de tener pelotero grandes ligas. Recordemos que Arenal tuvo peloteros de la talla de Álvaro Castro -tenía todo para llegar-, Joaquín Torres, Argemiro Beleño, José Narváez, entre otros. “Me emocionó ver a mi hijo lanzando allá donde están las estrellas. Era su sueño desde niño y le pido a Dios que le haga realidad ese sueño para que sea grandes ligas. Creo que se lo merece por su dedicación y disciplina”, aseguró desde Arenal su padre Félix De Ávila. Arenal, la potencia número uno de la provincia, muy pronto tendrá el privilegio de tener un hijo suyo en grandes ligas. Urshela, Mercado y Jordan Por su parte, Giovanny Urshela se fue en blanco en dos turnos, en el triunfo de su equipo Tigres de Detroit 5-3 sobre Piratas. Óscar Mercado negoció un pasaporte en dos turnos, anotó una carrera, en el triunfo de Padres de San Diego 3-1 sobre Medias Blancas de Chicago. Jordan Díaz se fue de 3-0 en el triunfo de Atléticos de Oakland 7-4 sobre Gigantes.",

(IROZ GAIZKA / AFP)\nA preliminary investigation into sexual assault and violence at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) was opened by the Bayonne public prosecutor’s office on Thursday December 28,\nlearned France Bleu Pays Basque. No complaint had been filed, the prosecution took matters into its own hands. Of the “images” of a “concerning incident that took place on the hotel premises” ont “circulated” on social networks, indicates the American group Hyatt which manages the site. Michelin-starred chef Aurélien Largeau, dismissed Thursday December 21, for its part refutes the existence of a “humiliating hazing of a kitchen assistant”.\nThe hotel group states in a press release that “This incident does not reflect the values that we all defend, an investigation was carried out and the appropriate decisions were taken.” “I would like to formally deny the allegations made against me,” answers Aurélien Largeau. “I condemn any form of mistreatment, hazing or humiliation within the brigades and more broadly, and I will never associate myself with such behavior.” he continues, indicating that he is preparing his defense with his lawyers in order to “stop the defamation”.\nView comments\nRead more: The Steam version of the yellow-haired masterpiece \"NTRaholic\" will be released in May, and \"After Stories\" will be added in the future talk | 4Gamers\n1703800807\n#investigation #opened #sexual #assault #violence #palace #Hôtel #Palais",

Stating that 'nation first' was not just a slogan but his life's aim, the PM asked the young trainees to walk with him in this journey.As some of the officers shared their experiences from the training they received as assistant secretaries, Modi recalled the earlier interaction with them as part of the Aarambh programme in 2022. He said the intent behind the assistant secretaries programme was to provide the officers the opportunity of experiential learning from the top to bottom of the administrative pyramid.Referring to schemes like Lakhpati Didi, Drone Didi, PM Awas Yojana etc, he asked the trainees to work with a saturation approach to take these schemes further to the people, adding that it shall ensure social justice and prevent discrimination. tnn",

    "title": "Cong-led Karnataka government targets temples with a controversial bill - Telugu News - IndiaGlitz.com",
    "text": "The Karnataka government's recent passage of the Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment bill has sparked controversy, with the BJP accusing the Congress-led government of \"anti-Hindu policies\" and misuse of funds. The bill mandates that the government will collect 10 percent of the income of temples that have revenue of more than Rs 1 crore, and 5 percent from those with revenues ranging between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. The BJP has alleged that the state government is targeting Hindu temples and that the collected funds will be used for other purposes, rather than for the benefit of the temples themselves. BJP's Karnataka unit president Vijayendra Yediyurappa questioned why the state government was only collecting revenue from Hindu temples and not other religious structures. He also expressed concern that the funds would be misused.Karnataka's transport minister and Congress leader Ramalinga Reddy dismissed the BJP's accusations, saying that the government is not taking the money, but rather using it for \"dharmic parishad\" purposes, such as the upliftment of economically weaker priests and the provision of quality education to children of priests. Reddy also accused the BJP of bringing religion into politics and claimed that the Congress is the true proponent of Hinduism, pointing to the party's record of safeguarding temples and Hindu interests over the years. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate in India over the role of the government in religious affairs. Some argue that the government should not interfere in religious matters, while others believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that religious institutions are managed properly and that funds are used appropriately. The Karnataka government's decision to collect revenue from Hindu temples is likely to face legal challenges, as some argue that it violates the constitutional right to freedom of religion. The outcome of these challenges will have implications for the relationship between the government and religious institutions in India. Follow us on Google News and stay updated with the latest!
