    "title": "Court Rejects Trump's Request to Halt E. Jean Carroll Case",
    "text": "By Theodore Bunker | Thursday, 28 December 2023 05:06 PM EST Former President Donald Trump's request to halt proceedings in his upcoming defamation trial was rejected by a federal appeals court on Thursday, NBC News reported. Attorneys representing Trump filed a request with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to grant a 90-day stay on proceedings in the case, which concerns comments he made about E. Jean Carroll and her allegations of sexual assault in 2019. Trump had attempted to argue that he couldn't be sued over the remarks, which were made while he was president, due to presidential immunity. However, the court ruled unanimously that Trump waited too long to raise the issue of presidential immunity as a defense. The trial is set to start on Jan. 16. It concerns comments Trump made — calling Carroll a \"whack job\" along with other disparaging remarks — and will focus only on the monetary damages to which Carroll is entitled. A previous trial involving Trump and Carroll resulted in a jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarding Carroll $5 million in damages. Trump is appealing that verdict and continues to deny the allegations. Theodore Bunker, a Newsmax writer, has more than a decade covering news, media, and politics. © 2023 Newsmax.

    "text": "Nairobi — Former Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has expressed optimism for the future of Kenya after President William Ruto sacked the entire cabinet following pressure from Gen Zs.\nIn a statement on his X account, Kibwana praised the decision which he stated reflected the growing clamor for accountability and good governance.\n\"New Kenya, nothing less! A land where the citizen & the constitution are sovereign under God. Gen Zs, you sting like Bees. You worthy heirs of Dedan Kimathi whom you will bury in dignity.\" noted Kibwana.\nHis message resonated with many, particularly the younger generation, who have been vocal about their desire for change and economic liberation. By invoking the legacy of Dedan Kimathi, a revered figure in Kenya's fight for independence, Kibwana underscored the historical significance of the moment, calling on the youth to continue the struggle for a just and prosperous Kenya.\nKibwana's reference to the \"Third (Economic) Liberation\" echoes a sentiment growing among Kenyans who see economic reforms as the next crucial step in the nation's development. The concept of Ubuntu, emphasizing shared humanity and community, further reflects the collective aspirations for a united and equitable society.\n\"Asante. We can smell the Third (Economic) Liberation & Ubuntu,\" Stated Kibwana\nIn announcing the changes on Thursday, President Ruto stated that Principal Secretaries will manage the respective ministries until a new Cabinet is named.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Governance Kenya Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

The demonstrations, which saw tens of thousands of youths take to the streets, resulted in violent clashes with police forces, leading to tragic outcomes.\nMore than 40 protesters were killed, and over 300 others were injured in the worst police brutality seen in the country, sparking widespread condemnation both locally and internationally.\nRead the original article on Capital FM .",

    "text": "Se mejora así la seguridad en entornos exigentes\nPilz añade la ampliación de campo visual y la conexión FSoE a su sistema PSENradar\nPilz, empresa experta en automatización segura, ha actualizado las prestaciones del sistema de radar seguro PSENradar con nuevas aplicaciones, gracias al campo visual ampliado, y conexión FSoE. A partir de ahora, el dispositivo es capaz de realizar la supervisión de espacios de protección en entornos más exigentes gracias a la ampliación del campo visual. Esto facilita la integración de los sensores de radar en diferentes entornos de producción. Además, el radar es compatible con la conexión al protocolo de seguridad EtherCAT FSoE, en consecuencia, se reduce el volumen de cableado y de los costes.\nMás productividad gracias al ángulo de visión flexible\nAl sensor de radar con alcance de 0 a 5 metros, ahora se le une el radar seguro PSEN rd1.2 sensor F-FOV LR con un alcance de 0 a 9 metros. Con este aumento se asegura la protección eficaz de aplicaciones móviles.\nComo novedad, ambos sensores permiten la configuración flexible de campos visuales: además del ángulo de visión simétrico, se pueden configurar también ángulos de visión asimétricos y de tipo corredor. Este avance asegura la fiabilidad de PSENradar en diferentes entornos de producción y permite liberar espacio en la producción, especialmente en condiciones de poco espacio, por ejemplo, máquinas contiguas sin separación o zonas de paso adyacentes a las máquinas. La personalización del campo visual permite posicionar el sensor de radar de forma que no limita las tareas de producción y mejora la seguridad en entornos exigentes y la productividad.\nRadar conectado al protocolo FSoE\nPSENradar y el microcontrol configurable PNOZmulti 2 de Pilz constituyen una solución completa y segura para la supervisión de espacios de protección. Además, incluyen la transferencia de datos segura con FSoE en el sistema de comunicación EtherCAT. El nuevo dispositivo de evaluación del sistema de radar PSENradar soporta la funcionalidad FSoE para aplicaciones de seguridad hasta SIL 3 según IEC 61508. Como FSoE-MainInstance (FSoEMaster), PNOZmulti 2 concentra en un dispositivo la supervisión de todas las funciones de seguridad de una aplicación de radar y proporciona conexiones con FSoE SubordinateInstances (FSoE-Slaves) seguras en la red. El conjunto completo, formado por el microcontrol seguro PNOZmulti 2 funcionando como FSoE-MainInstance y el sistema de radar seguro, permite implementar fácilmente esta conexión en red segura. Con ello, se consigue reducir el volumen de cableado y minimizar costes.",

    "text": "ST. JOSEPH COUNTY, Mich. (WSBT) — The National Weather Service surveyed the damage and confirms an EF 2 tornado touch downed in St. Joseph County. This part of St. Joseph County, between Centreville and Mendon has widespread damage. A swath of destruction can be seen for quite a distance. “I’ve been involved in law enforcement for 28 years, and I don’t remember a storm that came through that caused the path of destruction like this one in our county,” said Jason Bingaman, St Joseph County Undersheriff. Undersheriff Jason Bingaman recalls what his community experienced Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms spawned a tornado, causing extensive damage throughout the county. County officials immediately went into action. “We were doing life-saving measures, making sure that we can account for all the people in to make sure that people were safe,” said Bingaman. According to St Joseph County officials, two minor injuries were reported in Tuesday’s storm. Undersheriff Bingaman is thankful the injuries weren’t any worse. “This particular storm went right through a section of our county where there are several houses that are Amish. We had to make sure we were reaching out to them individually to make sure that they were safe,” said Bingaman. Property damage is the biggest thing left to clean up days after the storm. Farm fields littered with debris, grain bins are squished, irrigation equipment is bent and for some the damage is worse. “There are total losses of houses. For those folks, it’s a matter of being able to find a place for them to stay for now, and then, immediate making sure they have shelter,” said Bingaman. Now that the storm is done, the cleanup continues.",
