    "text": "The New Year Honours list takes centre stage on the front pages of several of Saturday’s newspapers. The Daily Mail concentrates on “poignant honours” for parents who have campaigned for justice after losing their daughters. The Daily Mirror labels the honours a “farce” as it says former rugby league stars turned “charity heroes” Kevin Sinfield and Rob Burrow have been “refused knighthoods” while former prime minister Liz Truss’s resignation list was also “slipped out”. The Daily Express calls for more unsung heroes to receive honours. The i warns of rail chaos heading into the new year while The Guardian says the next government will inherit a backlog in the courts and NHS which will run until the next decade. The Sun carries Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s advice to players after thieves broke in to steal £1 million worth of jewellery from Jack Grealish’s Cheshire home. The Times focuses a plan to combat long-term sickness benefits by allowing employers by enforcing out-of-hours health therapy. The Daily Telegraph tells of a new push by the government to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders in the wake of a brutal attack on Kyiv. The Financial Times says equities and bonds have made big gains since late October after global interest rates peaked, but the UK has lagged behind the US and Europe. The Independent echoes the words of Lord David Cameron calling for China to drop charges against Hong Kong businessman and activist Jimmy Lai. The Daily Star focuses on how beavers are doing their bit to help the British countryside.

    "text": "Mason Miller, the A’s All-Star closer and perhaps their most valuable trade candidate, is heading to the injury list with a broken left hand.\nThe rookie reliever fractured the fifth metacarpal in the pinky of his non-throwing hand after Monday night’s win over the Houston Astros,\naccording to Martín Gallegos of MLB.com. It was initially unclear how Miller suffered the fracture, but Gallegos later clarified that Miller “put his hand down awkwardly on the training table while getting ready to do an exercise.”\nMiller has been placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Tuesday. He pitched a perfect ninth inning on Monday to seal the\nA’s 4-0 win over the Astros.\nMiller is in the middle of a sterling season, posting a 2.21 ERA with 15 saves and 15.5 strikeouts per nine innings. He is a potential trade-deadline acquisition for contending teams in need of an elite closer, though ESPN’s Buster Olney recently\nreported that he appears unlikely to be moved by next Tuesday’s trade deadline.\nThe A’s have not given a timeline for Miller’s return, but a metacarpal fracture typically takes at least three to four weeks to heal,\naccording to the British NHS.",

    "text": "Non-Brahmin priests, appointed under landmark Tamil Nadu reform, say they were banned from temple sanctum\nThey said they have never been allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the temple’s main deity, Lord Murugan, despite serving for over three years\nTwo non-Brahmin priests at a Tamil Nadu temple, appointed under a landmark caste-inclusive reform by the state government, have accused hereditary priests there of barring them from entering the sanctum sanctorum. With a major religious ceremony approaching, they have now sought the intervention of the state authorities.\nThe priests, S Prabhu and Jayapal, appointed in 2021 under the Tamil Nadu government’s initiative to open priesthood to all castes, alleged that they have been restricted to performing rituals only in secondary shrines at the Kumaravayalur Subramania Swamy Temple in Tiruchirappalli.\nThey said they have never been allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the temple’s main deity, Lord Murugan, despite serving for over three years.\nIn a formal petition addressed to Chief Minister M K Stalin and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) Department, Prabhu and Jayapal detailed their plight, complaining that their exclusion has persisted despite legal and administrative backing for their role.\n“We were appointed by the government under a historic scheme that enabled individuals from all castes to become temple priests. But since our appointment on August 14, 2021, we have not been allowed to perform pujas inside the sanctum sanctorum of the presiding deity,” they wrote. “Now, with the Kumbabishekam (consecration ceremony) scheduled for February 19, we are being completely sidelined.”\nThe two priests alleged that while temple devotees have treated them with respect, the hereditary Sivacharyas (Brahmin priests) continue to deny them equal rights within the temple. “This discrimination has caused us immense mental distress and humiliation. We wonder how we can face our families and our villagers when we are kept away from the very rituals we were appointed to perform,” they wrote.\nHR and CE Minister P K Sekar Babu was unavailable for comment, as was the temple administration.\nTamil Nadu’s decision to appoint non-Brahmin priests in 2021 was a significant shift from a centuries-old tradition where temple priesthood remained largely hereditary and Brahmin-dominated. The policy, an extension of the Dravidian movement’s long-standing push for social justice, aimed to break caste barriers in religious spaces. However, its implementation has faced persistent resistance.\nWhile 382 individuals, including 15 women, have completed government-certified training as priests and are awaiting temple placements since 2022, only 29 have been officially appointed so far. Additionally, 95 individuals are currently undergoing training.\nAppointments of non-Brahmin priests at major temples in significant religious sites, like Tiruvannamalai, Madurai and Srirangam, remain a challenge with caste-based opposition continuing to hinder full implementation of the reform.\nV Ranganathan, president of the Tamil Nadu Association for Trained Archakas, told The Indian Express that non-Brahmin priests appointed in Trichy temple, in August 2022, have not been allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum even once.\n“Reports from multiple temples highlight continued discrimination and intimidation against non-Brahmin priests. At the Naganathan Swamy Temple in Tiruchirappalli, Brahmins in the locality have been questioning the knowledge of non-Brahmin priests in Sastras, engaging in discriminatory remarks to undermine their legitimacy. In the Tindivanam Perumal Temple, non-Brahmin priests are being used primarily for cleaning tasks within the temple and domestic work at the homes of Brahmin priests rather than being permitted to perform religious rituals. A similar case has emerged at the Vellappillayar Temple in Salem, where a trained non-Brahmin priest has been appointed to serve as the priest for the Murugan deity. Despite possessing a formal appointment order, local Brahmin priests have allegedly refused to let him perform his duties, subjecting him to caste-based humiliation,” Ranganathan said.\nIn September 2024, NDA ally PMK criticised the government for failing to enforce the rights of non-Brahmin priests. PMK leader S Ramadoss alleged that at least ten out of the 24 priests appointed under the scheme had faced exclusion from temple sanctums and were relegated to cleaning temple premises instead of performing religious duties.\n“The government introduced this reform, but it has failed to ensure dignity and equal treatment for these priests,” Ramadoss said in a statement. “Many non-Brahmin priests continue to be treated as second-class members within temples.”\nThe Tamil Nadu Association for Trained Archakas has repeatedly called for stronger legal measures to prevent discrimination against non-Brahmin priests. The HR & CE Department, which oversees temple administration in the state, sought reports on these in September, 2024.",

    "text": "By Travis Case ,\n27 minutes ago In a perfect world, teachers would be just as well-known and beloved as big-name actors.\nWell, two Maryland teachers, Maggie Arnold from Fredrick High and Bradley Absher from Bodkin Elementary School, got the red carpet treatment today.\nBoth classroom heroes won the \"Oscar\" of education, the Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987 to recognize excellent instructors.\nThe winners don't get just a shiny new trophy or blue ribbon.\nThey receive a whopping $25,000 check with an all expenses paid trip to Los Angeles with other Milken winners.\nArnold immigrated to the US as a kid, and eventually fell in love with teaching. Her students see her as the perfect balance of demanding and encouraging.\nAbsher is known for his hands-on, creative approach. For example, he teaches his kids how to multiply fractions with the end result of creating a “No Bake Cheescake.”\nBefore they begin the main lesson, he gets students number engines revved up through his “Number Talks” warm-up lesson.\nWith teachers like Arnold and Absher leading the way, Maryland's future is bright.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
