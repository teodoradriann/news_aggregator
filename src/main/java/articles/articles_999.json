    "text": "Residents in parts of Queensland smashed by multiple extreme weather events have been warned it will take time to recover.\nThe state was hit by flooding, tornado-like winds and rain that claimed the lives of seven people in the days after Christmas.\nTens of thousands of homes around the Gold Coast have also endured four days without power as heatwave conditions built.\nFederal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said some suburbs’ power networks had been “completely smashed”.\n“The scale of the damage we’ve seen across a pretty big part of southeast Queensland is very large and therefore is going to take some time to work through,” Senator Watt said.\nEmergency services have been stretched by flooding in Cairns and far north Queensland followed immediately by storms in the southeast.\nSome suburbs’ power networks have been “completely smashed”, federal minister Murray Watt says. (JASON O’BRIEN/AAP PHOTOS)\n“When you’re dealing with disasters from one end of the state to the other, literally, that is a real test for people and there’s incredible work being put in,” Senator Watt said.\nPort Douglas residents and businesses were told to stop using water immediately on Friday after a landslide halted operations at a treatment plant.\nDouglas Shire Council has organised collection points for bottled drinking water with a limit of two litres per person and trucks will supply non-potable water at Port Douglas Community Hall and Mossman State High School.\nActing Inspector Nick Sellars said police were attending 22 road intersections where power had been cut to traffic lights, including near the Gold Coast’s major theme parks.\nDisaster Recovery Minister Nikki Boyd said five homes had been destroyed across the Gold Coast, Logan and Scenic Rim regions and 27,400 customers were without power.\nMs Boyd said 90 per cent of homes and businesses should have their power restored by New Year’s Eve and 80 SES workers were en route to assist.\nFederal Nationals leader David Littleproud warned Australia was only at the start of the disaster season, casting doubt on the accuracy of weather warnings.\n“We’ve got a lot of recovery to do in fixing a lot of roads, a lot of infrastructure and helping farmers out who have lost a lot of produce,” he said.\n“If they haven’t provided the right warnings with the right information at the right time, then questions should be asked.”\nGovernment Services Minister Bill Shorten said the bureau faced unpredictable circumstances in tracking Cyclone Jasper in far north Queensland.\n“The Bureau of Meteorology does, on balance, a pretty good job,” he said.\n“But this was just an extraordinary set of circumstances and now the focus has got to be helping people.”\nTemperatures are expected to soar across most of northern Australia.\nParts of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face extreme to severe heatwave conditions.\nMarble Bar in WA’s Pilbara region may reach 49C on Saturday and temperatures up to 45C are expected there for six days.\nIn the Northern Territory, it’s predicted to reach 40C in Katherine and 43C in Tennant Creek, and warm minimums in Darwin are likely to make for uncomfortable nights.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43C, while up to 37C is forecast for Gympie in the storm-ravaged southeast.\nHighs of up to 36C are predicted in Brisbane, while Longreach in the state’s west is forecast to get to 47C.\nPeople in the worst impacted areas have been urged to stay indoors, close windows and blinds to keep heat out of homes and seek out fans or air-conditioners.",

    "text": "A DJ is facing furious backlash and a [police ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/police)probe after filming himself urinating on a cancer patient. Leigh Brookfield, 40, was playing tunes for a [wedding ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/weddings)when he carried out the nasty act. Footage of the stunt was shared on Snapchat, which sees him appear to show fake sympathy for an older gentleman in the men's toilets. The man tells him of prostate problems he has been suffering with, about which Brookfield says he’s “sorry to hear”. But while he does this, he appears to deliberately spray urine on the man’s back while he’s not looking.

Dyfed Powys Police in Wales have been made aware of the incident and are looking into complaints of “assault”. Brookfield performs around Llanelli, West Wales, in pubs and weddings. The DJ posted an apology on Facebook and his account has since been deleted. In it, he wrote: “I'm apologising to you all regarding my actions this evening. I'm deeply sorry for those who I have offended and if I could take it all back I would. “It's just something me and the boys do when we are drunk and until watching the video back I didn't realise that the nice gentleman next to me was going through health problems.” The apology, though, did not have the desired effect and ended up causing more uproar. One outraged social media user posted in response: “It's something you and your mates do when you are drunk? So this isn't the first time you've p",
