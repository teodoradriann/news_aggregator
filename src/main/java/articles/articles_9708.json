    "title": "Time capsule discovered in backyard of Los Angeles home connects woman to her late father",
    "text": "By Josh Haskell\nClick here for updates on this story\n LOS ANGELES ( KABC ) — Jacqueline Louise Bennett, who now goes by Lyn Campbell, holds a letter her father wrote over 60 years ago and then buried in the backyard of their Northridge home without telling anyone.\nThe time capsule marks the completion of a playhouse her father and grandfather built, which was central to the 27 years that she lived there.\n“It’s very emotional for me and I have so many memories here from this home. I mean, I was my parent’s only child. My dad died when I was only 8 and so the memories of him are tied this house. It feels like he’s around me and that’s very special because I was a daddy’s girl,” said Campbell, who the letter was addressed to dated Nov. 26, 1961.\nCampbell no longer lives in Northridge, but she would come back a few times a year to see her old house, her old school and celebrate memories. On one particular visit last month, she was able to connect with the current homeowner, which is how she learned of the time capsule.\n“We only kept it because it was a little history of this house when we started our own family,” said Grace Medrano. “I figured it must have been important to somebody. We kept it for my daughter so as she got older, I could tell her look what we came across. This was your home and it belonged to a little girl also.”\nBack in 2019, Medrano and her husband made some upgrades to their backyard, which included demolishing the playhouse. That’s when their contractor found the time capsule.\nJacqueline Louise Bennett, who now goes by Lyn Campbell, shared this letter with ABC7 that her father wrote over 60 years ago and buried in the backyard of their Northridge home.\n“If the playhouse was still standing, we wouldn’t have seen this. We wouldn’t have known it was there and then I thought, how is it that Grace kept it?… They could have thrown it out. They didn’t know me. They didn’t expect to see me or meet me or meet anyone related to this home,” said Campbell.\nCampbell says she’s already showed the time capsule to her son and grandson and plans to pass it onto them – so they can carry on her memories of the people and places that matter most.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "He said that the work done by the Government of India during the ten years since 2014 has helped to improve India's performance from a dysfunctional government to an efficient government. Rajeev Chandrasekhar was speaking as the Indian representative at an international conference held in London on the topic of \"Future of Britain in a Changing World Order’. Digital identity for 1.2 plus billion Indians is the core of our government architecture, which has, in many ways, transformed the narrative of India, which was earlier described as having a dysfunctional government. Before 2014, the general narrative about most of Asian countries was also that they could not deliver to their people. It was after 2014 that we embraced technology and transformed the narrative of a dysfunctional democracy and government. Our approach to technology and digitizing governance transformed the narrative. He said India has successfully established its digital public infrastructure, which could be adopted by other democratic countries. The address by Rajeev Chandrasekhar was well appreciated by Mr. Tony Blair, in his commitments, subsequently. While addressing the audience along with Lord William Hague referred to the initiatives and leadership taken by Rajeev Chandrasekhar for establishing the digital system of governance.",

Many airlines globally are revising their schedules to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace while also calling off flights to Israel and Lebanon amid growing fears of a possible broader conflict in the region after the killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. The Chicago-based airline suspended its daily Newark, New Jersey-Tel Aviv service on July 31, citing security reasons. The flight, however, was available for booking from Sept. 1. On Thursday, United said it was now removing the Tel Aviv flights from its schedule. Customers can seek refunds or rebook United flights to any city in Europe or the Middle East, it said. Its rival Delta Air Lines has halted its flights between New York and Tel Aviv through Aug. 31. REUTERS",

    "title": "The Urban Oasis of Urban Shaman Donna Henes",
    "text": "Donna Henes is an expert at expunging bad spirits from bad apartments. She [calls herself an “urban shaman”](https://someseriousbusiness.org/donna-henes-biography/) and has deployed oils and semiprecious stones to [keep ghouls out of other people’s spaces](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/30/garden/turf-cleaning-out-those-pesky-old-poltergeists-in-the-closets.html). But to find her own apartment — where she has performed marriages, tarot readings, and various rituals — she needed a different set of tools. Henes was bopping around Manhattan apartments before 1972 when [she got word](https://www.amazon.com/Bless-This-House-Creating-Sacred/dp/0486818454?tag=thecurbedsite-20&ascsubtag=__cb0418aam__clv5kt3e7000l0ifdyr0wkbdm ) about a 5,000-square-foot loft in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. There was no heat, no hot water, and the space was so undesirable that the landlord gave her three months rent free. Henes made upgrades herself and stayed for 17 years, through a period of gentrification. Then came the [MetroTech project ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Commons)— the office complex across from Borough Hall, designed around Polytechnic University. The development displaced [220 people](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/realestate/metrotech-a-test-for-a-new-form-of-urban-renewal.html), including Henes. She organized tenants, leading a movement that won them a major concession: comparable apartments nearby, or cash [settlements.](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/30/nyregion/metrotech-agrees-to-pay-2-million-to-aid-tenants.html) The agreements were confidential, but property records show that MetroTech’s developer, [Forest City,](https://thebridgebk.com/forest-city-in-brooklyn-a-real-estate-pioneer-on-the-way-out/) moved tenants into eight apartments in a former school house that the company [had been redeveloping](https://www.brownstoner.com/interiors-renovation/ps-9-apartments-brooklyn-school-history-279-sterling-place/). Sitting on Vanderbilt Avenue, the building was an ornate [1895 Romanesque revival](https://hdc.org/buildings/public-school-9-annex/) with carved petals in its brick and terra cotta facade, and a high-ceilinged arch entry. It had been occupied by [squatters](https://www.brownstoner.com/interiors-renovation/ps-9-apartments-brooklyn-school-history-279-sterling-place/) and the top floor, where Henes ended up, had never been designed for living. The 3,000-square-foot space toward the back of the fourth floor had been used for storage. Forest City’s renovation aired the space out by adding nine skylights and turned two squares of roof into outdoor terraces. But ceilings sloped all the way down to the floor — making visitors bop their heads. Henes blocked off those triangular nooks with closets and custom cabinets, which she filled with her drums, candles, art books, and ritual supplies. (Her broker, Myrel Glick, counted 29 closets.) Henes also added color — pink and green and yellow — and turned one room into an art studio, another an office where she wrote six books, and another became a guest bedroom for a granddaughter to visit every summer. An industrial sink was useful for potting plants, which lined the terraces. She and her partner, Daile Kaplan, sourced antiques as far as France and fit them into every last nook. Henes had what she calls a “thing” for painted furniture, mirrors, flamingos, and palm trees — a style that a friend labeled as “Palm Beach 1940s,” though Henes also [describes](https://www.amazon.com/Bless-This-House-Creating-Sacred/dp/0486818454?tag=thecurbedsite-20&ascsubtag=__cb0418aam__clv5kt3e7000l0ifdyr0wkbdm ) the aesthetic as “the self-portrait of my soul.” Glick has sold in the building before, but says [the top-floor unit is special](https://myrelglick.elliman.com/sales/detail/527-l-536-17_22952267/279-sterling-pl-prospect-heights-brooklyn-ny-11238) — not just because it’s never been on the market, and because it’s the only apartment with a terrace (two, actually). But because other units in the building feel more like typical apartments. Here, the masonry of the old storage space is still visible, with walls of exposed brick arches. “It’s the most beautiful place in the building because you see the structure of how the building is built,” she said. The apartment gave Henes room to grow her business as a shaman. She’s best known for performing ceremonies out-of-doors: [leading](https://www.amny.com/news/urban-shaman-to-lead-the-village-halloween-parade/) the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade with a crew of friends in white and silver, to “clear the streets of any negative energy,” as she [told Gothamist](http://gothamist.com/2007/10/31/donna_henes_urb.php), and welcoming the Vernal Equinox by leading crowds to [balance 360 eggs on their tips at sites across downtown Manhattan](https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/above-and-beyond/eggs-on-end). But her apartment was also a home for rituals that earned her commissions. She conducted weddings, taught classes, and read cards in a great room that she dubbed Mama Donna’s Tea Garden and Spirit Haven. And all those rituals left a mark. “Because it holds three decades of blessings,” she wrote in one of her books, [Bless This House](https://www.amazon.com/Bless-This-House-Creating-Sacred/dp/0486818454?tag=thecurbedsite-20&ascsubtag=__cb0418aam__clv5kt3e7000l0ifdyr0wkbdm",

    "text": "Pressione alta, la cura è nel pomodoro: ecco l'ultimo studio spagnolo L'ortaggio, tipico della dieta mediterranea, si caratterizza per l'elevato numero di minerali e vitamine, tra cui il licopene ed i flavonoidi Il pomodoro abbassa la pressione: ecco i benefici dell'ortaggio I pomodori, ortaggi tipici della dieta mediterranea, abbassano la pressione e si caratterizzano per l’elevato contenuto di minerali, vitamine liposolubili e soprattutto licopene, un carotenoide cui sono state attribuite proprietà antiossidanti e antinfiammatorie. Lo riporta il quotidiano \"l'Erborista\". Nuove prove di efficacia, riguardo i benefici dei pomodori, sono emersi dall’analisi dei dati dello studio spagnolo sulla dieta mediterranea denominato “Predimed”, un trial randomizzato e controllato che ha valutato l’effetto di un intervento basato sulla dieta mediterranea in soggetti che presentavano un elevato rischio cardiovascolare. La suddivisione della popolazione esaminata in base all’assunzione giornaliera di pomodoro ha permesso innanzitutto di rilevare tra i consumatori regolari di questo ortaggio una maggiore adesione alla dieta mediterranea e un maggiore consumo di frutta e verdura nell’alimentazione quotidiana. [LEGGI ANCHE: Tumore, i cibi che prevengono il cancro. Ecco cosa dovresti mangiare](/medicina/tumore-i-cibi-che-prevengono-il-cancro-ecco-cosa-dovresti-mangiare-893670.html) L’analisi dei risultati, raccolti nel corso di tre anni di osservazione, ha mostrato inoltre una correlazione lineare tra il consumo di pomodori e i valori della pressione sistolica e diastolica nei soggetti con ipertensione di I grado. La valutazione separata dei dati relativi soltanto alle persone che non avevano una diagnosi di ipertensione all’inizio dello studio ha mostrato una riduzione del 36% del rischio di sviluppare questo disturbo tra coloro che consumavano in media 110 g di pomodori al giorno. Trattandosi di uno studio osservazionale non è possibile definire dei rapporti di causalità tra l’assunzione alimentare e parametri di salute, tuttavia questi dati suggeriscono che il consumo di pomodoro, all’interno della dieta mediterranea, svolge un ruolo favorevole sia nella prevenzione che nella gestione dell’ipertensione. Questi effetti protettivi sembrano correlati con l’azione antiossidante, antitumorale e antinfiammatoria attribuita ad alcuni composti del pomodoro, come per esempio il licopene e altri flavonoidi, l’acido ascorbico e il potassio, che esplica un effetto di stabilizzazione dei valori pressori.

    "text": "O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) sancionou a lei que cria o protocolo \"Não é Não\" em todo o Brasil, para proteger mulheres de assédio e violência em shows, bares e boates. A publicação foi feita na edição desta sexta-feira (29/12) do Diário Oficial da União (DOU). A nova norma entrará em vigor em seis meses. Ao serem vítimas de constrangimento ou violência, as mulheres terão o direito de ser prontamente protegidas pela equipe do estabelecimento, que deverá receber com respeito o relato sobre o acontecimento. Nesta ocasião, a mulher deverá ser informada sobre seus direitos e também terá o direito de decidir sobre a medida a ser adotada diante do episódio, por quem quer ser acompanhada na ocasião e de ter sua segurança garantida caso ou quando decida deixar o local. [Lei cria programa de proteção às mulheres vítimas de violência](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/cidades-df/2023/05/5095054-lei-cria-programa-de-protecao-as-mulheres-vitimas-de-violencia.html) [Projeto das forças de segurança estimula mulher a registrar violência](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/cidades-df/2023/11/6661396-projeto-do-governo-estimula-mulheres-a-registrar-violencia-domestica.html) [Mulheres manifestam na Rodoviária do Plano Piloto contra o feminicídio](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/cidades-df/2023/12/6776955-mulheres-manifestam-na-rodoviaria-do-plano-piloto-contra-o-feminicidio.html) Para o cumprimento do protocolo, as casas deverão dispor de pelo menos uma pessoa na equipe preparada para lidar com a situação, inclusive com os números da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher (180). Estes números de telefone e as formas de acionar o protocolo também devem estar em locais visíveis. São dois os tipos de violência: constrangimento envolvendo qualquer insistência, física ou verbal, sofrida pela mulher depois de manifestada a sua discordância com a interação e violência com uso da força que tenha como resultado lesão, morte ou dano, entre outros, conforme legislação penal em vigor. Em caso de indício de violência, a equipe do estabelecimento tem a obrigação não só de proteger a vítima e afastá-la do agressor, mas também colaborar com as autoridades na identificação de possíveis testemunhas do fato, chamar a polícia, isolar o local do acontecimento até a chegada da polícia e disponibilizar imagens de câmeras de segurança, caso haja, entre outras providências. O descumprimento da lei pode acarretar advertência, revogação do selo Não é não – Mulheres seguras, exclusão do estabelecimento da lista de “Local Seguro para Mulheres”, além de outras penalidades previstas em lei. A lei, assinada também pela ministra das Mulheres, Cida Gonçalves, pelo ministro da Educação, Camilo Santana e pelo ministro substituto da Justiça e Segurança Pública, Ricardo Cappelli, institui ainda o selo ‘Não é Não – Mulheres Seguras’, a ser concedido aos estabelecimentos comerciais não abrangidos pela lei que, mesmo assim, adotarem o protocolo de prevenção à violência contra as mulheres. O protocolo é parecido com o implantando em Barcelona, o \"No Callem\". Na Espanha, ele foi aplicado no episódio que envolveu o jogador brasileiro de futebol Daniel Alves, acusado de estuprar uma mulher em uma boate. São deveres dos estabelecimentos: - assegurar que na sua equipe tenha pelo menos uma pessoa qualificada para atender ao protocolo “Não é Não”; - manter, em locais visíveis, informação sobre a forma de acionar o protocolo “Não é Não” e os números de telefone de contato da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher - Ligue 180. Se houver indícios de violência: - proteger a mulher e proceder às medidas de apoio previstas nesta Lei; - afastar a vítima do agressor, inclusive do seu alcance visual, facultado a ela ter o acompanhamento de pessoa de sua escolha; - colaborar para a identificação das possíveis testemunhas do fato; - solicitar o comparecimento da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente; - isolar o local específico onde existam vestígios da violência, até a chegada da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente. Se o estabelecimento dispuser de sistema de câmeras de segurança deverá também garantir o acesso às imagens à Polícia Civil, à perícia oficial e aos diretamente envolvidos e preservar, pelo período mínimo de 30 dias, as imagens relacionadas com o ocorrido.

This week, former CIA programmer gets 40-year sentence, zero trust prevents widespread damage, possible ransomware attack in Georgia, alleged hacker detained in Ukraine, USB-spread malware in Italy, LockBit attack on non-bank home mortgage lender, and Ukrainian critical infrastructure disrupted.

Joshua Schulte's sentencing encompasses a 2022 [guilty verdict](/ex-cia-employee-convicted-in-theft-covert-hacking-info-a-19561) handed down for causing the largest data breach in CIA history in 2017, as well as a separate trial last year for possession of child sexual abuse materials that also resulted in a jury verdict of guilty. A 2020 trial on the leaking charges that ended with a hung jury also produced convictions of contempt of court and making material false statements. Schulte, 35, developed penetration tools for the espionage service and sent WikiLeaks a trove of techniques used for snooping on iPhones, Cisco networking devices, Skype and smart TVs (see: [7 Facts: 'Vault 7' CIA Hacking Tool Dump by WikiLeaks](/7-facts-vault-7-cia-hacking-tool-dump-by-wikileaks-a-9766)). \"Joshua Schulte betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen, heinous crimes of espionage in American history,\" [said](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-cia-officer-joshua-adam-schulte-sentenced-40-years-prison-espionage-and-child) U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York. \"And all the while, Schulte collected thousands upon thousands of videos and images of children being subjected to sickening abuse for his own personal gratification.\" Hacker Used Stolen Okta Tokens in Cloudflare Attack A probable nation-state hacker used an access token and three service account credentials stolen from Okta in September to access a self-hosted Atlassian server used by internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare, Cloudflare disclosed Thursday. The company said it \"failed to rotate\" the credentials after Okta [disclosed](https://sec.okta.com/harfiles) the attack in October. Cloudflare said no customer data or systems were affected by the penetration, a fact it attributed to its embrace of zero trust architecture. Zero trust is \"like bulkheads in a ship where a compromise in one system is limited from compromising the whole organization,\" company executives [wrote](https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident) in a blog post. Cloudflare called the attacker - whom it didn't name - \"sophisticated\" and said they had a \"thoughtful and methodical manner\" and likely hailed from a nation-state operation. According to the company's timeline, from Nov. 14 to Nov. 17 the hacker conducted reconnaissance and accessed the internal wiki, which is based on Atlassian Confluence, and the bug database, which is based on Atlassian Jira. \"On November 20 and 21, we saw additional access indicating they may have come back to test access to ensure they had connectivity,\" Cloudflare said. On Nov. 22, the hacker used a Jira automation and customization tool called ScriptRunner to establish persistent access. The attacker \"tried, unsuccessfully, to access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in São Paulo, Brazil.\" Cyber defenders terminated the attacker's access on Nov. 24, the company said. Cybersecurity Attack on Georgia's Fulton County Causes Outages Georgia's Fulton County is grappling with a cybersecurity attack that disrupted phone lines, the court system and the tax system over the weekend. Among the affected county employees is District Attorney Fani Willis, who leads an election interference criminal case against former President Donald Trump and alleged co-conspirators. \"At this time, we are not aware of any transfer of sensitive information about citizens or employees, but we will continue to look carefully at this issue,\" county Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts said during a Monday press conference. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution [reported](https://www.ajc.com/news/many-fulton-systems-still-down-experts-suggest-money-motive/AKUGPBQCS5CBDJPSYQHA4VPG5M/) Thursday that cyber experts believe the attack was a ransomware attack and was likely not politically motivated. The county is recovering from the attack although many public services and internal county operations are still inoperative, the newspaper said. Ukraine Detains Alleged Russian 'Cyber Army' Hacker The Ukrainian domestic security service agency [said](https://t.me/SBUkr/10967) on Telegram that it has arrested a suspected member of Russian intelligence-backed hacker group Cyber Army of Russia. Authorities said the individual, identified as a tech specialist from Kharkiv, had conducted DDoS attacks on government websites. The suspect allegedly joined the group through a hacker channel on Telegram. Authorities said the man fed target information for missile attacks, including one that struck a hospital. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison. USB-Based Malware Campaign Targeted Italian Organizations A financially motivated threat group tracked by Mandiant as UNC4990 is using USB devices to infect Italian organizations - and using third-party websites such as GitHub, Vimeo and the forum section of news site Ars Technica to host malicious payloads. The threat intelligence company [said](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc4990-evolution-usb-malware) the hackers behind the threat actors have been active since at least 2020 and favor targets in the health, transportation, construction and logistics sectors. The legitimate services used by hackers to host payloads weren't hacked. \"Nor did any of these organizations have anything misconfigured to allow for this abuse,\" Mandiant said. In the case of Vimeo, hackers inserted an encoded payload into the description of a video about spacy progressive rock band [Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53N99Nim6WE). The video is no longer available. An infection starts with a victim clicking a malicious LNK shortcut file on a USB device, which leads to the execution of a coded PowerShell script that loads a downloader Mandiant dubbed Emptyspace, also known as [BrokerLoader](https://fortgale.com/blog/featured/nebula-broker-offensive-operations-italy/) and [Vetta Loader](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/202311-Vetta-Loader_Def-min.pdf). The downloader communicates with the executable payload hidden on a third-party website. Threat actors use a backdoor Mandiant calls Quietboard that's capable of arbitrary command execution, clipboard content manipulation for crypto currency theft, removable drive infection, screenshotting, system information gathering, and communication with the C2 server. Planet Home Lending Notifies Customers of Ransomware Attack Planet Home Lending said it had been hacked by Russian-speaking extortion gang LockBit and notified nearly 200,000 customers of a November data breach incident. The non-bank lender [attributed](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/5f9aa393-9c7a-49e0-855f-5e36adfb9e6c.shtml) the breach to a vulnerability in NetScaler devices known as Citrix Bleed (see: [ Amid Citrix Bleed Exploits, NetScaler Warns: Kill Sessions](/amidst-citrix-bleed-exploits-netscaler-warns-kill-sessions-a-23653)). Compromised personal identifiable information includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, loan numbers and financial account details. The company said it had not paid a ransom demand and does not plan to pay any ransom to the threat actor. Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure Targeted Several state-owned Ukrainian critical infrastructure operators reported service disruption last week stemming from a cyberattack on their cloud-based information systems maintained by [Parkovy](https://www.facebook.com/ParkovyiDC/posts/pfbid02UbSXANaQkZGqD32G3bA5bNerPiAq6E7CyRxBPGCDFCwbkaHS3zeFj8uunrrY6nfSl) data center facility in Kyiv. At least five Ukrainian organizations confirmed the service disruption, including state-owned energy company [Naftogaz](https://t.me/NaftogazUA/1836); national postal service provider [Ukrposhta](https://www.facebook.com/igor.smelyansky/posts/pfbid06MTAwgYgHKqCDrsexZNJJQcTumLSRA7JcQE5GLDRYKAjxfprXwoftzemndBhqmRVl); state railway [Ukrzaliznytsia](https://t.me/kyiv_city_express/516), [DSBT](https://www.facebook.com/DSBT.UA/posts/pfbid027jPiFaUSaVnQ7aWyAziQwaRYQELNENLC45BV7AEGhnpZ3zadDCxfufep4zxnbabel), the agency responsible for transport safety; and the state [television channel](https://detector.media/infospace/article/222165/2024-01-25-u-roboti-chastyny-saytiv-mpiu-stavsya-zbiy-cherez-kiberataku/) established for residents of the occupied areas of Ukraine.

    "title": "Longshoremen strike could hit hybrid port operations in Georgia, North Carolina",
    "text": "A looming East and Gulf Coast dockworker strike by the International Longshoremen’s Association could be detrimental even to cargo container ports in right-to-work states such as Georgia and North Carolina, experts said. Talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which negotiates on behalf of management of the ports, terminals and shipping lines, have stalled. No new contract talks have been scheduled. The six-year ILA master contract covering about 25,000 dockworkers and other port employees from Maine to Houston expires Sept. 30. Ports with hybrid work models – employing both union and nonunion workers – in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, could see a significant impact to operations if there is a work stoppage. Under the hybrid model, non-union employees operate lift equipment to load and unload the containerships and ILA members perform the rest of the longshore work. “It’s expected that the Port of Savannah will not operate in the event of a strike. Based on the direction of previous strikes, even as a hybrid employer, it’s unlikely that non-union workers will continue working,” Mia Ginter, director of North American ocean at C.H. Robinson, told FreightWaves in an email. The Georgia Ports Authority has about 1,500 nonunion workers, according to state [documents](https://gaports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GAPortsAuthority01-FINv2.pdf). Although employees at the Georgia Ports Authority are currently not unionized, employees of the stevedoring companies operating at the Port of Savannah are members of the ILA. They include clerks and cargo checkers. North Carolina State Ports Authority, which includes the Port of Wilmington, employs 145 union workers and 250 nonunion employees. Nari Viswanathan, senior director of supply chain strategy at Coupa Software, said an ILA strike at the Port of Savannah could affect the entire global supply chain. “Ports in Georgia, especially the Port of Savannah, are critical gateways for goods entering the southeastern U.S. These ports play a pivotal role in global supply chains, handling diverse products for the entire nation’s imports and exports,” Viswanathan told FreightWaves in an email. “Given that these ports connect to major trade routes, a halt in operations would mean massive delays in the shipment of goods, increase transportation costs, and potentially cause shortages across the world.” Officials for the Georgia Ports Authority did not respond to a request for comment. Related: [Could East Coast port strike spread to West Coast?](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/could-east-coast-port-strike-spread-to-west-coast) Ginter said a strike would close five of the 10 busiest ports in North America and could impact import and export freight around the world. “Not only would no country be outside the impact, but also no industry would be immune,” Ginter said. “It is likely that industries like automotive and pharmaceuticals would be more affected than others, though. As a rule of thumb, a one-week disruption at a port can result in one month of congestion, backlogs and delays.” Viswanathan also said an ILA strike could force shippers to reroute their cargo to ports on the West Coast. “Continuous disruptions should compel businesses to rethink their reliance on these ports, potentially redirecting more traffic to other regions or investing in alternative logistics solutions. For instance, businesses might opt to reroute shipments to less affected West Coast ports or other international ports,” Viswanathan said. “This shift could trigger changes in trade patterns and logistics strategies, accentuating the importance of flexibility, timely reconfiguration of supply chains, and robust contingency planning.” The ILA recently won a court battle against port authorities in South Carolina and Georgia over nonunion jobs. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a dispute between the state of South Carolina and ILA dockworkers at the Port of Charleston’s Leatherman container terminal. State officials in Georgia and South Carolina as well as the National Right to Work Foundation also filed briefs asking the Supreme Court to hear the case between the ILA and South Carolina Ports Authority regarding unionized jobs. The ILA had won a ruling against the state of South Carolina in July 2023, giving unionized dockworkers the right to staff every job at the Leatherman container terminal. The South Carolina Ports Authority employs 700 workers, with ILA members performing the majority of the longshore work, while 270 nonunionized state employees operate state-owned lift equipment. Mark Mix, president of the foundation, said the ruling could mean the ILA could eventually fight to take all nonunion jobs at the ports of Savannah and Wilmington. The National Right to Work Foundation is a nonprofit whose mission is “to eliminate coercive union power and compulsory unionism,” according to its website. “I suspect that the ILA will push very hard … to say that all ports under the authority of this master contract with United States Maritime Exchange, they all need to be union jobs,” Mix told FreightWaves in an interview. “Those nonunion employees at the other ports that have the hybrid model will be under pressure to change the way they operate.” Mix said an ILA strike would make it hard for hybrid ports like Savannah and Wilmington to continue operating. “The Port of Savannah might try to continue, but it would be awfully difficult,” Mix said. “I don’t think anybody tries to work during a strike. They’ll likely try to get some boats in, and get some people to try to do things, but that’s a pretty complex operation.”",
