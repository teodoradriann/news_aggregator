October 24, 2024 at 04:50 PM 6 minute read [Regulation](/topics/regulation/) What You Need to Know - After fighting tooth and nail to get an amendment on the November ballot, Florida's cannabis players are still expecting more obstacles. - With Gov. Ron DeSantis coming out against the bill full force, lawyers in the space expect the implementation period to be cumbersome. - But if the ballot measure passes and a reasonable regulatory environment blooms, lawyers expect more transactional opportunities. After spending over $100 million to bankroll an amendment that would ask Florida voters whether to legalize marijuana recreationally, cannabis industry players might still face an uphill battle to get the law implemented even if voters approve the ballot initiative.

Microsoft Xbox Series X\nWhat is your Gamertag/PSN ID/Switch ID?\nWhich mode has this happened in? Career Mode\nWhich part of the mode? Manager Career\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Load a manager career mode match and try to make subs late in the second half (75-80 minutes)\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? You can't change subs and starting players and then pressing B to back out does not work\nWhat should be happening instead? Should be able to switch players between the starting 11 and the bench and also should be able to back out of team management\n‌\nEvery time I try to make a sub in a manager career mode match whether playing the match or in sim mode the screen will get stuck on team management if you try to make subs later in the second half. It's ridiculously frustrating having to close the whole game and reload, in turn then losing all progress. Hopefully this can be fixed without us all having to restart our saves.",

    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has apologised for the incorrect translation of a 'shloka' from the Bhagavad Gita which had created a row. Mr Sarma's post on X had landed him in the crosshairs of the Opposition with several leaders accusing him of promoting caste divisions. In his apology, Mr Sarma said that the verse had been posted on his X account by his team to keep up his tradition of sharing one Gita 'shloka' daily with his followers. \"As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation,\" Mr Sarma said on Thursday. The BJP leader said he deleted the tweet as soon as he noticed the mistake. \"As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,\" he said. As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas.\nRecently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation.\nAs soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly… The post which sparked a political row had incorrectly said that according to the Gita, it is the duty of the Shudras to serve the other three castes - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi had launched a sharp attack on Mr Sarma saying that he was not fulfilling his oath of treating every Indian citizen equally. \"In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras.” Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It's reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam's Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,\" Mr Owaisi said on X (formerly Twitter). In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras.”\nHolding a constitutional position, your oath… Himanta Sarma in his apology post also said that Assam was the picture of a casteless society and the incorrect translation was a mistake.",

    "text": "【环球时报驻埃及特派记者 黄培昭】一个以意大利科学家为首的科研团队日前宣称，通过卫星雷达等技术，他们在埃及吉萨金字塔群的哈夫拉金字塔下方发现了一处疑似“庞大地下城市”的神秘结构。虽然这一考古发现尚存争议，但在科技手段、科技设备的助力下，埃及近期不断取得各类考古发掘成果，却是不争的事实。\n意大利团队发现“地下城”？\n根据意大利等国科学家的说法，他们主导的“哈夫拉项目”在哈夫拉金字塔底下大约640米的地方，发现藏有巨大石灰石的平台，里面有两个80米见方的长方形房间，还伸出来8条直径在10到12米之间的圆柱井。\n这些井壁像个旋转的楼梯，接近650米的地方，还连着更深的水流通道。科学家团队认为，竖井的形状可能就是通往地底世界的大门。更不可思议的是，距离地面约1219米深处，雷达扫描出来的图像竟显示有“复杂发光体”，它的振动频率跟地上的建筑截然不同。\n研究团队表示，这一发现可能意味着哈夫拉金字塔下方存在尚未被记录的地下通道系统，甚至可能与其他金字塔或古代遗址相连。不过，埃及等国考古学者对于这一发现仍持谨慎态度，认为需要进一步的探测和物理挖掘来确认这些结构的真实性和历史背景。埃及当地媒体认为，学者们对此莫衷一是，这也是考古界学术交锋的正常现象。\n此次研究被认为可能进一步揭示了哈夫拉金字塔内部的特殊结构。早在2022年10月，该研究团队就在《遥感》期刊发表论文，认为哈夫拉金字塔内可能隐藏着密室、斜坡通道，并在基座附近发现了热异常。最新研究在此基础上，借助卫星雷达等技术探测到更深层的结构。埃及学家阿尔曼多·梅表示，这些发现可能会改变人们对金字塔功能及建造技术的传统认知。\n多项硬核科技助推埃及考古\n此次金字塔“庞大地下城市”的考古中，多种先进雷达技术发挥了关键性作用。\n研究团队首先利用高频地质雷达对金字塔周围的地层进行扫描。这项技术通过向地下发送电磁波，并分析回波信号的不同变化，来识别地下密度异常的区域。扫描结果显示，金字塔下方存在可能为人工开凿的通道，这一发现为进一步研究提供了基础。\n据多家外媒报道，哈夫拉项目的研究团队通过使用尖端合成孔径雷达 （SAR）技术，将金字塔考古探索向前推进了一步。这项技术使他们无须挖掘就能发现地下结构。\n据报道，为了进一步确认地下结构的性质，研究人员还引入电磁层析成像技术。这种方法类似于医学中的CT扫描。通过分析卫星雷达数据和电磁层析成像结果创建地下3D模型。结果显示，一个垂直竖井贯穿多个岩层，通向一个宽敞的地下空间，内部包含多个房间和疑似通道系统。\n事实上，近年来，围绕金字塔的考古发掘取得了一系列突破性发现，而这些发现的背后，现代科技手段扮演了至关重要的角色。从扫描技术到遥感探测，从人工智能到DNA分析，从内窥镜摄像到μ子成像技术，科技的进步使考古学家能够在不破坏文物的情况下深入探索金字塔的奥秘。\n例如，2017年，科学家利用宇宙射线μ子成像技术，在胡夫金字塔内发现了一个长约30米的巨大未知空间。2023年，研究人员再次利用该技术，在胡夫金字塔主要入口附近发现了一条长约9米、宽约2.1米的隐藏通道，可能有助于理解金字塔的建造方式和内部结构。\n“该方法的优势是非侵入性，可以在不破坏金字塔遗址的情况下探测密闭空间。”埃及《消息报》称，宇宙射线中的μ子可以穿透密集的岩石，而其在不同密度材料中的衰减方式不同，使得科学家能够绘制地下空腔的轮廓。通过这一技术，考古学家和研究人员发现了宽敞的地下空间，并推测其可能与尚未发现的建筑群相连。\n与此同时，内窥镜摄像技术也被大量运用。研究人员使用一根小型光纤内窥镜，通过极细的孔洞进入通道内部，获取了通道的高清图像。这项技术不仅用于对金字塔内部结构的探索，也广泛地应用于古墓和其他遗址的探测性考古工作。\n2024年5月，研究人员通过卫星成像和沉积物分析，绘制出一条名为“Ahramat支流”的古代尼罗河支流。这条长约64公里、宽约0.5公里、深至少25米的水道曾流经吉萨地区，被认为在金字塔建造期间用于运输建筑材料和工人。\n具体来说，研究人员利用卫星图像，分析地下水文和地貌变化，推测古代尼罗河的河道位置。通过激光雷达技术的数据构建古代地貌模型。这一发现为金字塔建造提供了新的解释，即古埃及人可能利用这条水道将巨型石块从采石场运往吉萨地区。\n此前，考古学者还分别在萨卡拉、吉萨等地，发现了十多座失落的金字塔以及大量墓葬群，依靠的主要科技设备是红外成像和人工智能（AI）技术。科学家们利用红外热成像技术，发现了17座疑似被埋没的金字塔，以及数千座古墓和村庄遗址。通过分析昼夜温差，红外相机可以识别地表下埋藏的建筑结构，从而揭示被沙漠掩盖的秘密。\n研究人员还使用AI分析卫星图像，识别地貌异常区域，提高考古发现的精准度。AI还可以比对已知遗址的地貌特征，预测可能存在的未被发现的遗址。这项技术突破了传统考古的限制，使得考古学家可以在大范围区域进行无损探测，大幅提高效率。\n近年来，科学家们还对埃及古代木乃伊进行了基因测序，揭示了古埃及人与地中海、中东乃至撒哈拉以南非洲人的基因联系。通过对古代木乃伊的DNA进行测序，科学家能够重新了解古埃及人的族群关系、遗传病和饮食习惯。DNA分析填补了历史文献的空白，帮助学者更好地理解古埃及文明的种族构成和文化交流情况。\n稳定同位素分析也被运用在考古发掘工作之中。通过研究食物残留中的碳、氮、氧同位素，科学家们可以推测出古埃及人的饮食结构，如主食是否为小麦、大麦，是否依赖尼罗河渔获等。\n未来考古将迎来更大突破\n埃及考古界认为，展望未来，有理由相信，在科技新成果的助力下，埃及的考古发掘工作将会取得更加辉煌的成就，科技考古将揭开更多古埃及文明的神秘面纱，让世界更加了解和认识这个古老而伟大的文明。\n一方面，随着尖端合成孔径雷达、地质雷达技术、三维扫描与建模技术以及宇宙射线成像技术等现代科技手段的不断完善和发展，人们将能够更加深入地探索古埃及文明的奥秘。例如，通过合成孔径雷达和地质雷达技术，可以更加精确地探测地下遗址的结构和布局；通过三维扫描与建模技术，可以更加直观地展示遗址的全貌和细节；通过宇宙射线成像技术，可以更加深入地了解地下遗址的内部构造和材质。\n另一方面，随着人工智能、大数据、云计算等前沿技术的引入和广泛应用，各国科学家们将能够更加高效地处理和分析考古数据。例如，通过人工智能技术，可以对考古遗址进行自动识别和分析；通过大数据技术，可以对考古数据进行深度挖掘和关联分析；通过云计算技术，可以实现考古数据的共享和协同研究。这些先进技术的应用将为考古工作者提供更便捷和高效的研究工具。\n“未来，随着AI、3D建模和 机器人 探测等技术的发展，埃及考古学可能会迎来更多革命性的突破。”埃及《金字塔报》这样写道。",

    "text": "TORONTO — The case of an Ontario man who carried out a deadly attack on a Muslim family was the first to recognize terrorism on grounds of white supremacist ideology and further emphasized that terrorism isn't limited to those who belong to specific groups, experts and observers said after the landmark trial ended this week. Nathaniel Veltman was sentenced Thursday to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years for each of four counts of first-degree murder in the June 2021 attack that killed four members of the Afzaal family in London, Ont. Veltman, 23, was also sentenced to life in prison for the attempted murder of a boy who survived. All five sentences are to be served concurrently. In handing down the sentencing decision, Ontario Superior Court Justice Renee Pomerance said Thursday it was an \"inescapable conclusion\" that Veltman committed a terrorist act in hitting the Afzaal family with his truck. She noted he targeted them because they were Muslim, and expressed white nationalist beliefs in a manifesto and in his statements to police. \"Terrorism is not exclusive to any group or ideology,\" she said. \"Right-wing extremism is as potentially destructive of the social order as any other belief system promoting hate and violence.\" Forty-six-year-old Salman Afzaal; his 44-year-old wife, Madiha Salman; their 15-year-old daughter, Yumna; and her 74-year-old grandmother, Talat Afzaal were killed in the attack. The couple's nine-year-old son was seriously hurt but survived. The case was the first time Canada's terrorism laws were put before a jury in a first-degree murder trial. It also \"marks the first time in Canadian history that a case involving white nationalism has met the threshold of terrorism,\" Amira Elghawaby, Canada's Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, said after the ruling. \"This decision will have profound reverberations across Canada,\" Elghawaby said. Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen's University's school of religion, said the terrorism finding was important in light of the overwhelming evidence of ideological motivation. \"If Veltman, of all people, who mowed down a family, who left a manifesto ... who literally called himself a white nationalist and called for the deportation of certain minorities -- if that isn't ideology and if that isn't defined that way, then what exactly is the point of these words?\" he said. \"It's important for these things to be applied fairly across ideologies and movements,\" he added. It will be interesting to see what happens in the future in cases involving \"more nebulous, far-right individuals who don't leave much behind,\" he said. While the terrorism ruling wasn't a surprise given the evidence heard at trial, Pomerance's decision provides details on how to consider political purpose and ideological motivation -- both key elements of terror under law -- \"in a way that we haven't seen before in criminal trials,\" said Michael Nesbitt, an associate professor of law at the University of Calgary who specializes in anti-terrorism. In the past, someone accused of terrorism would be linked to a group, and that group with an ideology, which would then tie the person to that ideology, he said. That made things more difficult when dealing not only with lone actors, but also with individuals \"drawing from a potpourri of different ideological influences,\" rather than a focused movement or group, he said. Thursday's ruling shows that the anti-terror laws in place are capable of capturing that sort of activity, which better reflects what officials have identified as the current security threat environment in Canada, he said. \"This is an example of a successful prosecution where they made the case with the available evidence just associated with the individual,\" he said. In her decision, Pomerance said Veltman \"did not need to commune with a group and he did not even need to leave his apartment in order to become wholly immersed in extremist doctrine.\" While radicalization is complex, based on the evidence presented at trial, Veltman \"drew much of his rage from internet sources, which he repeatedly accessed in the days and moments leading up to the attack,\" she said. The judge said she would not refer to Veltman by name or repeat his beliefs in order to avoid giving him the attention he sought. That position is understandable, but it also makes it more difficult to parse out how the things Veltman said stack up against our understanding of white nationalism, which is part of assessing ideology, said Barbara Perry, the director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University. \"So that was, I think, something that will be food for lots of conversation and debate in months to come,\" she said. Faisal Bhabha, an associate professor at York University's Osgoode Hall law school, has long opposed anti-terrorism laws, arguing they are deployed in a discriminatory fashion and serve no real purpose since the acts they cover are already illegal. Veltman is facing the same sentence for the first-degree murders as anyone convicted of those offences without a terrorism component, he said, which shows terror convictions are largely symbolic. \"If it doesn't lead to different sentencing principles, then what is the point of a terrorism offence at all?\" he asked. Bhabha pointed to the case of Alexandre Bissonnette, the gunman who killed six people in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. Bissonnette pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder, none of them with a terrorism component. Bissonnette was initially sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years, under a law in place at the time that allowed judges to stack the mandatory 25-year parole ineligibility periods in cases involving multiple first-degree murders. That sentence, and the law allowing it, were then struck down by Quebec's top court, a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. Bissonnette's parole ineligibility was brought down to 25 years. However, the fact that Pomerance considered terrorism as a key factor in sentencing Veltman to life for attempted murder was \"noteworthy,\" he said. \"That might be the future of anti-terrorism legislation, to be able to capture acts ... that might not attract significant sentences, for acts that are short of murder that advance a terrorist cause,\" he said.
