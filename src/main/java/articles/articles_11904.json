    "text": "- Hull invented and commercialized the first 3D printing technology, Stereolithography, which gave birth to the 3D printing industry\n- Adoption of additive manufacturing transforming how products are developed, healthcare is delivered\n- Hull and fellow laureates honored at ceremony at The White House on October 24, 2023\nROCK HILL, S.C., Oct. 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today,\n3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced Charles (Chuck) Hull, its co-founder and chief technology officer for regenerative medicine, has received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (NMTI). Established in 1980, the NMTI is the United States’ highest honor for technological achievement, awarded by the President of the United States for outstanding contributions to America’s economic, environmental, and social well-being. Mr. Hull is being honored for the invention, development, and commercialization of Stereolithography (SLA), which launched the 3D printing industry, and for continuing innovation and leadership in additive manufacturing technology. He received the honor from President Joseph Biden at a ceremony held at The White House on Tuesday, October 24, 2023.\nMr. Hull was Vice President of Engineering at UVP, Inc. (now owned by Analytik Jena), a company that manufactures ultraviolet light sources for industrial and scientific applications when he began working on a way to fuse UV resins into three-dimensional structures to create product prototypes. In 1983, he produced the first 3D-printed part, an eye wash cup, using Stereolithography. Mr. Hull applied for a patent for this technology, and in 1986 he co-founded 3D Systems through which the SLA-1, the first 3D printer, was commercialized. With the founding of 3D Systems, he initiated the 3D printing industry.\nIn 2014, Mr. Hull was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame at the United States Patent and Trademark Office for his globally impactful and transformative work inventing and pioneering 3D printing. The same year, he received the European Patent Office’s prestigious European Inventor Award in the non-European countries category for his contributions to technological progress and the advancement of society. In 2016 Mr. Hull received the Manufacturing Leadership Lifetime Achievement Award from Frost & Sullivan’s Manufacturing Leadership Council, and The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) honored him and named the SLA-1, the first commercial 3D printer, a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. He also received The Economist’s prestigious 2013 Innovation Award, recognizing significant contributions across the fields of science and technology. Mr. Hull is a named inventor on 85 United States patents, plus numerous other patents around the world in the fields of ion optics and 3D printing.\n3D Systems remains a leader in innovation with state-of-the-art production 3D printers, materials, software, and application experts that have changed how products are manufactured and healthcare is delivered. As 3D Systems’ Chief Technology Officer for Regenerative Medicine, Mr. Hull continues to bring his pioneering spirit to the next frontier of 3D printing — bioprinting. He leads the 3D Systems team collaborating with United Therapeutics in a joint development program to establish an unlimited supply of human lungs, requiring no immunosuppression, potentially allowing patients with end-stage lung disease to benefit from an unlimited supply of tolerable, transplantable organs.\n“On behalf of the entire company, I congratulate Chuck as a recipient of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation,” said Dr. Jeffrey Graves, president & CEO, 3D Systems. “He has had a remarkable career with his efforts not only changing the trajectory of manufacturing but also impacting the human condition by changing how healthcare is delivered. Chuck’s invention of Stereolithography gave birth to an industry and since that time, the number of 3D printing technologies has proliferated, as have the applications for which they are used. Advancements in applications such as satellites, electric vehicles, medical implants, dental aligners, chip manufacturing, carbon capture — 3D printing is playing an integral role in each one — all made possible by Chuck taking the first step with SLA. I’m inspired by his passion and believe we’ll see the possibility of bioprinted human organs becoming a reality in his lifetime. It’s a pleasure to collaborate with Chuck and I am so very grateful and privileged to call him a colleague and friend.”\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    "title": "Florida demanda a EE. UU. por bloquear investigación de intento de asesinato contra Trump",
    "text": "La fiscal estatal de Florida, Ashley Moody , ha interpuesto una demanda en un tribunal federal para impedir que el Departamento de Justicia (DOJ, por sus siglas en inglés) de EE. UU. bloquee la investigación del estado sobre el intento de asesinato contra el expresidente y candidato republicano a la Casa Blanca, Donald Trump , ocurrido en septiembre pasado.\nSu oficina presentó este miércoles una queja en un tribunal federal de Florida contra el DOJ por su supuesto “ intento ilegal de bloquear la investigación penal ” del segundo intento de asesinato del expresidente (2017-2021).\nFlorida había anunciado una investigación estatal independiente de Ryan Routh, el hombre acusado de intento de asesinato de Trump en un campo de golf de su propiedad en West Palm Beach, por el que permanece detenido sin derecho a fianza.\nEFE “ En conversaciones con funcionarios federales y en correspondencia posterior, estos funcionarios han declarado que Florida no puede realizar su propia investigación, no puede entrevistar a testigos y solo puede cooperar con la investigación del gobierno federal ”, se lee en la demanda contra el DOJ.\nMoody dijo este jueves que Florida quiere una investigación del atentado de “ doble vía “, al tiempo que expresó su inquietud por el hecho de que las agencias federales que manejan exclusivamente este caso “ investigan e intentan procesar simultáneamente ” a Trump.\nDado que el DOJ “ está impidiendo que se lleve a cabo nuestra investigación independiente “, “ presentamos una demanda para asegurarnos de que Florida pueda tomar las medidas adecuadas para hacer cumplir sus leyes “, señaló la fiscal.\n“ Frustrar la investigación “ La denuncia de 18 páginas presentada en el Tribunal Federal del Distrito Sur del estado indica que es común que los estados investiguen violaciones de la ley estatal en paralelo a las investigaciones federales. Pero que, no obstante, poco después de que Florida anunciara la puesta en marcha de su investigación, el DOJ “ comenzó a tratar de frustrar la investigación ” del estado.\nEn una carta dirigida a Markenzy Lapointe, fiscal federal para el Distrito Sur de Florida, y al director del FBI, Christopher Wray, la fiscal Moody señala la “falta de confianza pública en la investigación federal” como uno de los argumentos para esta investigación en paralelo a la federal.\nApunta también la demanda al hecho de que, según Moody, el agente especial del FBI que lidera la investigación en Miami, Jeffrey B. Veltri, “ ha hecho declaraciones en el pasado que algunos creen que demuestran un sesgo en contra de Trump “. Por ello, pide la fiscal al tribunal que “ declare que Florida puede lleva a cabo su investigación sin violar ” ningún artículo.\nLa demanda de la fiscal general Moody explica que el Departamento de Justicia interpreta incorrectamente uno de los artículos y que, además, esa interpretación “ se entromete inconstitucionalmente en el poder estatal “.\nDe cualquier manera, Florida solicita al tribunal que impida que el fiscal general de EE.UU., Merrick Garland, bloquee su investigación oportuna para que Florida pueda, así, hacer cumplir la ley estatal y presentarle cargos estatales, si corresponde.\n*Con información de EFE",

    "text": "By Lindsey Toomer ,\n7 days ago The East Portal of the Moffat Tunnel near Tolland is pictured on June 26, 2023. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)\nColorado officials reached an agreement announced this week allowing Union Pacific Railroad to lease the Moffat Tunnel for another 25 years.\nUnion Pacific has paid Colorado $12,000 a year under a 99-year lease of the Moffat Tunnel that expires Jan. 6. Union Pacific also covers maintenance and insurance costs for the 6.2-mile tunnel that cuts through the Continental Divide near Winter Park at 9,239 feet above sea level. It is the highest railroad tunnel in the United States.\nThe 1926 agreement will be extended for four months as the state and Union Pacific finalize terms of the new agreement, which will start on May 1.\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\nA press release from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gave limited details on what the agreement will entail, but it said Union Pacific will access the tunnel in exchange for state access to Union Pacific tracks for passenger rail.\n“This is a big step forward in making Mountain Rail from Denver to Craig a reality,” Polis said in a statement. “Passenger Rail on this corridor will relieve traffic to one of Colorado’s iconic mountain communities and provide safe, reliable, affordable transportation options for tourists and skiers as well as workers traveling along the corridor. This historic agreement is an important step to protect continuous freight operations and finally deliver on the promise of passenger rail to Coloradans and I thank Union Pacific for its partnership.”\nSky-Hi News reported that Colorado can use Union Pacific’s tracks for up to three round trips per day in addition to existing routes run by federal passenger rail operator Amtrak. The Granby outlet said Union Pacific will allow the state to run passenger rail on its tracks between Denver and Craig in exchange for the lease on the tunnel.\n“We’re excited about the opportunity this renewed lease gives us to continue to serve our customers, while strengthening our partnership with the State of Colorado,” Union Pacific President Beth Whited said in a statement.\nAmtrak already uses part of Union Pacific’s tracks in the Colorado mountains for its daily, long-distance California Zephyr between Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area and its seasonal Winter Park Express ski train between Denver and the city-owned ski area. The Colorado Legislature passed a bill this year intended to set the state up for passenger trains to continue northwest at Bond and head up to Steamboat, Hayden and Craig.\nIn recent years the Moffat Tunnel has been the scene of a wastewater spill and the subject of scrutiny in a battle over proposed Utah oil trains traversing Colorado. A lawsuit over the oil trains made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court . The 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway, which would connect Utah’s largest oil field to the national rail network, was approved by federal regulators in 2021 but has been tied up in litigation ever since.\nJohn Putnam, a senior adviser for the Colorado Department of Transportation who led negotiations on the Moffat Tunnel, said the agreement allows the state to connect people and freight on the Western Slope and Front Range, which is what the state built the tunnel for 100 years ago.\n“We need alternatives to I-70 and the high mountain passes, and Moffat Tunnel and Union Pacific’s line provides that whether you’re traveling with kids or freight,” Putnam said in a statement.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n48",

    "text": "Iván Velez on the Joy of Helping Others\nSmile Train’s Program Manager for South America shares his journey and why he loves this work\nWhen Iván Velez thinks about generosity, he thinks about his parents.\nHe grew up in Medellín, Colombia, in the era of Pablo Escobar, when the drug trade and its spoils held a vice grip on the city. As a teenager, he watched friends get lured in with the promise of easy money and fast cars. Many of those friends did not survive to adulthood.\n“What you see in the movies, we lived,” he says.\nDespite dangerous surroundings, Iván enjoyed a warm and supportive home life. His mother and father worked minimum-wage jobs, but they always sent him to good private schools. He always received gifts at Christmas. Years later, with the perspective of adulthood, he marvels at his parents’ efforts.\n“When I was able to talk to my dad man-to-man, I told him, ‘You’re a magician. How did you manage everything?’ And he said, ‘Well, we had your mom, too,’” Ivan remembers.\n“My mom is 85 now, and she just gave up her driver’s license. She’s a strong, strong woman. She and my dad are why I believe in persistence, discipline, and hard work.”\nThanks to a loving home and a good head on his shoulders, Iván avoided the fate that befell so many other young men and women he knew in Medellín. He went to college, earned a degree in business, then settled into a job in the city.\nExpanding Horizons\nWhen Iván was in his late 20s, he got a phone call. It was his cousin in Los Angeles, who offered an idea.\n“Come stay with us for six months,” he said, “Take an ESL class.”\nSounds fun, Iván thought. He packed his bags and booked a flight, looking forward to his first taste of the US.\nHe stayed for 15 years.\n“I had trouble learning the verb ‘to be,’” he laughs.\nIván loved LA. He was smitten with American culture and values — freedom, democracy, equality. His aunt, a social worker with the city’s youth, became like a second mother. She reinforced his parents’ ethos of generosity and kindness.\nWorking for American companies, Iván realized the kind of professional he wanted to be: dedicated, driven, invested in others. He describes the lessons he learned during this time as “treasures.”\n“A Higher Purpose”\nIván returned to Medellín in 2008 a changed man. He landed a job as an English teacher at the Winston Salem Institute. His bosses recognized his commitment to his students right away. Before long, he was promoted to general director.\nIván proved to be a fierce advocate for transforming people’s lives through education. The Institute received municipal funds to focus teaching in crime-afflicted neighborhoods, and Iván soon found himself sitting down with gang leaders to discuss helping local kids. Children, some as young as eight or nine years old, would walk into these meetings and pull weapons out, setting them on the table before getting down to business.\n“I would come in to meet with the ‘bad guys’ and they would ask, ‘What would you bring to this community?’” Iván recalls.\n“My answer was always the same: ‘A brighter future for the kids.’ Then I explained: ‘We’ll bring in language, music, IT programs. Let’s show them a different path. If they see it, they’ll take it.’\n“We changed the lives of many children that way,” he smiles.\nTeaching at Winston Salem taught Iván a lot about himself. It made him realize that he liked work that had a higher purpose and he liked empowering others, allowing them to live with greater fulfillment.\nSo when he discovered a job opening at Smile Train 10 years later, he felt the promise of another exciting opportunity to do what he loves most — change people’s lives for the better every day.\nHis dedication and enthusiasm rang loud and clear in his interviews, even over Zoom. In October 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, he hit the ground running as Smile Train’s new Program Manager for South America.\nOn Call\nIn this role, Iván oversees Smile Train’s local medical partners offering cleft care in Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.\nPartnerships like these are at the heart of Smile Train’s sustainable model. Rather than fly outside doctors in for one- or two-week “short-term programs,” Smile Train provides local doctors and medical professionals in 75+ countries the ongoing training and resources they need to establish permanent, sustainable centers of cleft care in their own cities and towns.\nIván ensures that his partners always have what they need to run smoothly. He stays in regular communication with them, conducts quality-of-care oversight, helps to implement new programs, and assists with whatever issues may arise.\nIt’s a non-stop job. Which is why Iván’s first move was to let every partner under his purview know they could reach out to him 24/7, and he would answer.\n“I understand surgeons and practitioners have different schedules,” he says. “They respond to emails and make calls after hours, on holidays, on Sundays.\n“I always tell them — there's never too early, there's never too late. I am always a click away.”\nHe begins every week by doing his “rounds,” checking in with all of his doctors and teams, even if it’s just a brief call or message.\n“I let partners know that we’re here and we care,” he says.\nIván prioritizes in-person visits whenever possible. For partners within traveling distance of Medellín, he goes as often as he can, whether to help with Smile Train’s regular safety audits or to assist with special events such as\nJourneys of Smiles or Smile Train Choir performances.\nFor partner centers farther away, he tries to visit at least twice a year. When a new partner center joins, he goes immediately.\n“The virtual world is important,” he notes. “But when you shake hands or share a hug, that’s something else. You can achieve a lot more together.”\nSpreading Smiles\nOne of Iván’s proudest accomplishments is helping to significantly expand non-surgical cleft care offerings across his region, like the\nlifesaving nutritional support that makes surgery possible, as well as post-surgical orthodontics, speech services, psychosocial counseling, and more.\n“Cleft surgery partnerships are just the beginning of the path,” Iván observes. “When you add other comprehensive care into the equation, you get far greater results.\n“Let me tell you a beautiful story. We had a patient at Fundación Clínica Noel, our amazing partner here in Medellín. He was in his 50s, and he was single. He had lived his whole life with a cleft. Then he fell in love, and he decided to seek cleft treatment. He came to Clínica Noel, received surgery plus comprehensive cleft care, and at the age of 60, he finally got married.”\nIván could go on and on telling stories like this. There’s the young patient who brought\nDentsply Sirona executives to tears with his speech of thanks. There’s the Venezuelan doctor who performed cleft surgeries pro-bono for years, undeterred by the political instability that made it impossible for Smile Train to transfer money into his country. For Iván, each story is living proof of why the work matters: the courage of patients, the dedication of medical teams, the human spirit that brings them all together.\nSpreading the Message\nEven with all he has achieved, Iván has ambitious plans for the future. He wants to do more outreach to rural areas where internet connection is sparse and cleft-affected people are far less likely to be aware of Smile Train. Colombia is also home to indigenous populations who live autonomously in remote regions and often hold distinct cultural beliefs about clefts. He believes reaching these communities and educating them about clefts would be an absolute game changer, saving lives.\n“Awareness campaigns are extremely important for us,” Ivan says. “We have a lot to do in this area.”\nNo matter the challenge, Iván is up for it. He will continue to be on call unconditionally for patients, partners, and the wider cleft community.\n“I’m very grateful to be here doing this.”\nHelp support the staff who bring life-changing cleft care to children all around the world.",
