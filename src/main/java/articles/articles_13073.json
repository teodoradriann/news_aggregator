The exact number of employees affected and which countries or business units will see the largest impact remains uncertain. The sources requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the job cuts. [Samsung Electronics](/tag/samsung+electronics), a global manufacturer of smartphones, TVs, and memory chips, is reducing its international workforce by as much as 30% in certain divisions, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke to Reuters. The South Korean tech giant has directed its subsidiaries worldwide to cut sales and marketing teams by around 15% and administrative staff by up to 30%, as reported by two of the sources. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of this year, affecting jobs in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Six additional sources confirmed Samsung’s plans for [global staff reductions](/tag/global+staff+reductions). The exact number of employees affected and which countries or business units will see the largest impact remains uncertain. The sources requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the job cuts. Samsung, in a statement, described the workforce changes at some international operations as part of regular adjustments to enhance efficiency. The company clarified that there are no specific targets for the reductions and that production staff will not be affected by the plans. A source with knowledge of the plans indicated that the job reductions are being made in anticipation of a decline in global demand for technology products due to the slowing global economy. Another insider mentioned that Samsung aims to strengthen its financial performance by reducing expenses. It is currently unclear whether the company will also implement layoffs at its South Korean headquarters. Be the first one to comment. [Comment Now] COMMENTS [Comment Now] [Read Comment (1)]",

    "title": "India’s far-right cow vigilantes bolster clout before highstake elections - World - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "Vishnu Dabad attributes his rise from poverty to a powerful local politician to an animal: the cow. The 30-year-old is one of many Gau Rakshaks, or cow protectors: activists who have taken Indian laws banning cattle slaughter and beef consumption into their own hands since Prime Minister Narendra Modi [came to power](https://www.dawn.com/news/1106714) in 2014 at the head of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Scores of cow protectors in recent years have been accused of using [violence](https://dawn.com/news/1495016) to carry out extra-judicial activities, often finding themselves at odds with law enforcement, even as many won acclaim for defending the Hindu faith. Now some of these operatives are transferring their clout into grassroots political power, where they are pursuing a hardline majoritarian agenda, according to interviews with more than 90 activist-vigilantes, as well as senior leaders of the BJP and other parties, government officials, and political analysts. They described how cow vigilantism has become a finishing school for the young men who mobilise large groups against alleged cattle smugglers and used the resulting popularity to catapult into politics. Many are now campaigning and preparing for elections in 2024 that the BJP and allied right-wing parties are favoured to do well in. Forty-one of the cow protectors who spoke to Reuters have been elected to positions such as village chief, town council member, or local legislator in the past six years, roles that can involve governing tens of thousands of people. Another 12 said they were lobbying their family members to seek local office. “All of what you see: my success, my existence is only because cows have blessed me,” said Dabad, who started a cow protection force in 2014 and was elected as village chief in 2016. He is now a full-time political campaigner in the northern state of Haryana for a party allied with the BJP and is keen to seek higher office. Ancient Hindu religious texts praise cows, who are regarded as deities, for their nurturing ability. But India’s minority Muslims and Christians, as well as some Hindus, consume beef as part of their diet, generating some sectarian tensions. There is no publicly available official estimate on the number of cow activists nationwide, but activist leaders said they believe more than 300,000 Hindu men in the nation of 1.4 billion are directly involved with their groups. India’s interior ministry, which oversees national law enforcement, did not return a request for comment on that figure or the role of cow activists. Reuters previously reported that some of them have stopped cow traders, many of them Muslim men, with [deadly force](https://www.dawn.com/news/1421585), according to prosecutors, witnesses, and the families of victims. Some states have enacted laws enabling cow vigilantes to patrol alongside police. While government data does not distinguish general violence from cow-related lynching, Human Rights Watch found that at least 44 people, 36 of them Muslims, were [killed](https://www.dawn.com/news/1482673) in cow-related violence between May 2015 and December 2018. The independent, New Delhi-based Documentation of the Oppressed database found 206 acts of cow-related violence involving 850 victims, mainly Muslims, between July 2014 and August 2022. The proximity of cow activists to power has raised concerns among many Muslims, who allege that some BJP members and their affiliates have engaged in anti-Islam hate speech and violence. Modi and the BJP have denied that religious discrimination exists in India. Cow protectors “are very powerful men … and there is a climate of fear”, said Jaan Mohammed, a Muslim man whose brother was one of the first victims of a cow-related lynching after Modi took power. “I don’t think this can ever change now.” Legal proceedings are pending. Seventeen men accused of involvement in his brother’s 2015 killing were released on bail, and another suspect later died. Police at the time of the slaying said the alleged perpetrators behaved as if they had a “licence to kill”. Modi has repeatedly criticised activists who engage in “criminal” violence, even as his party courts their support. Giriraj Singh, a BJP minister responsible for rural development, said his party welcomed anyone who wanted to “genuinely serve the cows”. “Anyone who saves mother cow must be respected and recognised,” he told Reuters. Image of modern-day Hindu warriors Half of India’s 36 states and union territories have partial or complete bans on cow slaughter, most of them governed by the BJP. But enforcement has often fallen into the hands of activists. By posting videos of their raids on alleged cow smugglers on social media, they have mobilised money, as well as thousands of Hindu men. Religious cow protection movements have a long history in India, but many activists, including Dabad, said they were emboldened by Modi’s sweeping 2014 victory. Dabad recounted bloody fights between his activists who he said are often armed with batons, stones, machetes, and sickles, and alleged Muslim smugglers. He described spreading beds of nails on the road to stop vehicles suspected of smuggling cows, as well as high-speed chases and brutal attacks. “The journey to protect cows has not been easy,” said Dabad, who previously spent more than a month in jail for his vigilante activities. The police responsible for the area around his hometown of Chamdhera said Dabad has been the subject of nine criminal complaints related to religious clashes and that he was arrested once for allegedly beating up a Muslim trader. Investigations continue on one complaint, while the other probes have been dismissed, they said. The image of lawlessness has not stopped politicians from seeking the support of such activists. Six officials from the party of Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, who identified himself as Dabad’s political patron, said the activist was an effective campaigner and a rising star. Influential right-wing organisations such as the ruling party-affiliated World Hindu Council have helped legitimise the activists by depicting them as modern-day warriors waging a war against cow slaughter. Council spokesman Vinod Bansal likened cow protectors, some of whom he said were killed in clashes, to brave religious warriors. He added that achieving political fame was only a side-effect of the efforts of some activists. Christophe Jaffrelot, a professor of Indian politics at King’s College London, said the Indian state cannot harass minorities openly but by allowing vigilantes to do so, it keeps majoritarian feelings satisfied. “And now these private armies … are being given a share in governance and power at the local level,” he said, adding that they would continue their penetration of politics. During an interview in his guesthouse, as his aides smoked on a brass water pipe, Dabad looked at them and said: “We can all kill or get killed to protect the cow.” Force of their own Of the 41 vigilante-politicians, eight said they joined the BJP at its encouragement. Another eight, including Dabad, joined other regional parties because they said they had doubts about the BJP’s commitment to cows and Hindu values. “If police would effectively identify and apprehend the alleged violators of cow protection laws, then not a single Gau Rakshak will be needed,” said Ram Charan Pande, a cow vigilante leader who serves as a village head in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Narendra Raghuvanshi, a member of a regional nationalist party and a Gau Rakshak based in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, said that politicians often approached cow protectors for their support: “They know we can tilt the Hindu vote in their favour”. Some of the activists-turned-politicians have created power bases of their own. Dabad, the son of an illiterate farmer, now zips around Haryana in a convoy of four SUVs, while running a centre for injured and ill cows. He said his political clout helped him secure licences and offices for business ventures such as an alcohol store, an eatery and a real estate company. “I have been able to set all of these businesses because now people know me as a man committed to protect cows,” he said. That has caused unease within India’s opposition parties and the country’s security establishment, according to interviews with three officials and one lawmaker. A top Indian interior ministry official who was interviewed on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with media, said the cow vigilantes have managed to blend popularity with nous on local issues. “Even politicians feel threatened by the enormous network of cow vigilantes,” he said. “They have become a force of their own.”",

    "text": "Las ballenas jorobadas , esos enormes cetáceos acrobáticos que reinan sobre las aguas de todos los océanos, fueron más felices durante la pandemia de la Covid-19, cuando la actividad humana en el mar era muy limitada. Así lo revela un estudio realizado por la Universidad de Queensland en Australia que, apoyado en imágenes de drones y muestras de grasa, señala que las estrictas medidas de confinamiento que impuso el país oceánico a su población trajo consigo el contento de estos animales.\nA lo largo de 2020, la Covid-19 hizo que el mundo se parase. Las medidas de confinamiento que obligaron al ser humano quedarse en casa influenciaron el descenso de los niveles de estrés en las ballenas. Los resultados genéticos \"plantean la hipótesis de que las ballenas pueden haber estado respondiendo a una disminución de los contaminantes en sus remotas aguas de alimentación\", detalla el autor principal del estudio, Jake Linsky , publicado en la revista Marine Environmental Research .\nLas imágenes observadas permitieron conocer la condición corporal y valor energético de las ballenas jorobadas durante su migración anual por la costa australiana y durante su vehemente periodo de crianza. Asimismo, los científicos midieron genéticamente las concentraciones hormonales de las muestras de grasa extraídas ( cortisol y testosterona ) \"durante un periodo de cambios sin precedentes en la actividad antropogénica y los procesos naturales\", según el estudio.\nAdemás, el análisis de las muestras reveló concentraciones de cortisol, la hormona del estrés, significativamente más bajas en las ballenas estudiadas en 2021 respecto a las de 2020. \"Este cambio en su fisiología sugiere una disminución de los factores de estrés ambiental entre estos dos años\", señala Linsky.\nEstudios previos ya habían registrado cambios parecidos en las hormonas del estrés de las ballenas del lado opuesto al continente antártico, pero la investigación que ahora nos atañe sugiere que podría haberse tratado de un incidente generalizado en todo el Océano Austral.\n¿Es posible clonar a tu mascota en España?

    "title": "Richard Branson to co-pilot space balloon's first crewed flight to edge of Earth's atmosphere",
    "text": "Sir Richard Branson will co-pilot a hydrogen “space balloon” that will float a small group of high-paying passengers higher into the stratosphere than any commercial balloon has gone before — with the addition of cocktails and fine dining onboard.\nThe Virgin Galactic founder will be at the helm of the Spaceship Neptune which will take him and seven others 20 miles above Earth – with each passenger on the hook for $125,000 for the ride, the Florida-based company Space Perspective announced Thursday .\n3 A computer-generated image of what the Space Neptune will look like as it floats 20 miles above Earth. Space Perspective / SWNS The luxe capsule designed by Space Perspective features a window-filled cabin, plush chairs, fine dining, cocktails, and even onboard wi-fi. The floatable lounge also has a “proper” bathroom dubbed the “Space Spa,” according to the company website.\nThe total trip time is six hours. Of those six, two hours will be used to ascend to the maximum height and another two hours will be reserved for passengers to peer out of the capsule at the awe-inspiring curvature of the third rock from the Sun.\nPassengers don’t need to worry about being as physically fit as astronauts. Space Perspective said that the six-hour flight will be no more stressful on the body than a plane flight.\nExplore More Top Russian naval commander accused of war crimes is assassinated in Ukraine-planted car bombing: report Russia sends disguised troops to break through Ukraine defense, end up getting 'destroyed' Israeli soccer fans clash with France supporters as Paris put on high alert after Amsterdam attacks More than 1,800 people have already reserved seats on the commercial vehicle, which completed its first successful test flight just last month.\n3 Space Perspective boasts that each luxurious seat has the house’s best view. Space Perspective / SWNS Branson is an investor in Space Perspective and an avid ballooner. In 1987, he traversed the Atlantic Ocean and in 1991, the Pacific Ocean, setting world records with each trip.\n“Some of the most magnificent experiences of my life have happened on ballooning expeditions and I’m excited to support Space Perspective in its journey,” Branson said in a statement.\n3 The cabin of the space balloon will have room for eight tourists with a total of three pilots on the first flight. Space Perspective / SWNS The British billionaire will be joined on the trip by the company’s founders Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter.\n“Richard’s pioneering efforts in the ballooning industry were a key inspiration for us when we founded Space Perspective,” MacCallum said in a statement.\nThis won’t be the playboy billionaire’s first trip to suborbital space.\nBack in 2021, he won the billionaire space race by being the first person in that tax bracket to surf the ether in a self-funded rocket when he flew aboard Virgin Galactic’s VSS Eve. That space plane reached a height of 53 miles above the Earth.\nVirgin Galactic hit some turbulence earlier this year when their $450K-per-flight space tourism flight was grounded after a pin that held the ship in place “detached”.\nThe Space Perspective balloon flight is set to take off in 2025.",

    "text": "（菱傳媒／台北報導）政治評論員李正皓日前批評民眾黨立委麥玉珍國文程度差，今（17日）又指控，麥玉珍年初在自己創立的協會臉書社團公開PO出父母不詳的幼童照片，卻未去識別化，赤裸呈現在網路，公然違反《兒少法》，他要求麥玉珍請辭立委、民眾黨公開道歉。\n李正皓在臉書發文指出，收到檢舉，麥玉珍在今年1月23日用自己私人臉書帳號，在其創立的「社團法人台灣新移民協會」臉書社團公開發文，這篇貼文的照片是協會去拜訪關愛之家基金會，並且致贈物資給關愛之家基金會這些父母不詳的移工之子（黑戶寶寶）。\n李正皓說，但離譜、讓人憤怒的是，麥玉珍竟然不知道這些小朋友的照片，根據《兒少法》的規定在公布之前是要去識別化的，麥玉珍就這樣赤裸的將10幾張未去識別化小朋友的照片放上網路。\n他指出，據《兒少法》第69條第1項，媒體或其他公開渠道，不得報導或記載第56條第1項兒童之「姓名或足以識別身分之資訊」，其中56條第1項兒童即包含遭棄養的黑戶寶寶型態，且《兒少法施行細則》第21條規定，所謂「足以識別身分之資訊」包括：照片或影像、聲音、住所、親屬姓名、學校或班級等。\n李正皓痛批，麥玉珍此舉是一個極度低級的錯誤，也證明了麥玉珍不僅不識字，也不懂法，而且不懂法的下場是傷害了一群無辜的幼兒、小朋友，「這種不識字、不懂法的人根本沒有資格當立法委員」。\n李正皓喊話，請民眾黨表態，違反兒少法的立委還有資格當民眾黨的不分區立委嗎？請國民黨表態，大罷免在即，是否要繼續跟違反兒少法的立委與政黨繼續藍、白合？\n更多新聞：\n抓到了！桃園罷免選舉公報夾帶藍委「反罷文宣」　王義川轟：可以這樣發？\n鍾小平、游淑慧告發京華城案　陳佩琪：此生不忘這兩人得意嘴臉\n菱傳媒原始網址： 又槓上麥玉珍！李正皓控她曝光黑戶寶寶照片違兒少法　「沒資格當立委」",

    "text": "Intactdia Reveals Key Web Design Factors for Improving Google Search Rankings 04-02-2025 11:28 PM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nImage: https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcv1btORwqhLIXBefQREweWVqqV6WljKmU4umv2873AIbSSCLg6X_nje4BR9NsboL0cvCF4GT6fbso4qrc9mu93NxsQ2FtZkEY9b9inQ9JWVB6cuRhhiyJJK6F94SGdjw?key=mJAMVpF6mQmRvg_4H9moLwBT\nIn the digital era, a website's ranking on Google is a crucial factor in attracting organic traffic and gaining visibility. While many businesses focus on search engine optimization (SEO) strategies like keyword usage, backlinking, and content marketing, they often overlook a fundamental aspect-web design. A well-designed website not only enhances user experience but also plays a significant role in search engine ranking. Here's what a professional web design company [ https://www.intactdia.com/ ] should consider when building webistes.\n1. Mobile-Friendliness and Responsive Design\nGoogle prioritizes mobile-first indexing, meaning that a website's mobile version is considered for ranking before the desktop version. A responsive web design ensures that your site adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience for users across devices. Websites that are not mobile-friendly tend to have higher bounce rates, negatively impacting their ranking on search engines.\nAdditionally, Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool allows webmasters to check if their site meets mobile usability standards. Features such as touch-friendly buttons, scalable images, and a flexible grid layout contribute to a better mobile experience and improved rankings.\n2. Page Speed and Performance\nSite speed is a critical ranking factor in Google's algorithm. Slow-loading websites frustrate users, leading to higher bounce rates and lower engagement. Google's Core Web Vitals emphasize the importance of fast-loading pages. Efficient coding, optimized images, caching mechanisms, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) contribute to improved site performance and better search rankings.\nTo improve site speed, consider:\n*\nCompressing images and videos without sacrificing quality.\n*\nEnabling browser caching to store frequently accessed data.\n*\nMinimizing HTTP requests by reducing unnecessary scripts and stylesheets.\n*\nUsing lazy loading for images to load content only when needed.\n*\nImplementing Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to improve mobile page speed.\n3. User Experience (UX) and Navigation\nA well-structured, intuitive website design enhances user experience, which is a key ranking signal for Google. Websites with clear navigation, logical page hierarchy, and user-friendly layouts encourage visitors to stay longer and explore multiple pages. When users find what they need quickly, it reduces the bounce rate and increases dwell time-both crucial for better rankings.\nKey Elements of Good Navigation:\n*\nClear and concise menu structure.\n*\nLogical page hierarchy with internal linking.\n*\nBreadcrumb navigation to help users and search engines.\n*\nA well-structured footer with important links.\n*\nSearch functionality to improve content accessibility.\n4. SEO-Friendly Website Architecture\nImage: https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfG1bAVIU9sGvY5xQf_OcZsxs0c98ZvoWs0FDaiCJzeql15jYTAf-yQ7EyiIluhJQwvb53VY-Or0-ZRRZvx_Y1mJ5QRyQfUVylSIvopZ2kGxWtWVetPcDBYxuUTtbIlzB4?key=mJAMVpF6mQmRvg_4H9moLwBT\nA properly designed website should be structured to help search engines crawl and index content efficiently. Clean URL structures, an XML sitemap, internal linking, and proper use of heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) contribute to a well-optimized site. Search engines favor websites that are easy to index, leading to improved rankings.\nBest Practices for SEO-Friendly Architecture:\n*\nUse descriptive, keyword-rich URLs.\n*\nEnsure a logical and organized site structure.\n*\nOptimize robots.txt to control search engine crawling.\n*\nCreate an XML sitemap and submit it to Google Search Console.\nRelated: Search Engine Land - Site Architecture & Search Engine Success Factors [ https://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/site-architecture-search-engine-ranking ]\n5. Optimized Multimedia Elements\nImages, videos, and other multimedia elements play an essential role in web design, but if not optimized, they can negatively impact website performance. Large, uncompressed images slow down page speed, affecting SEO rankings. Properly labeled images with alt text also improve accessibility and provide additional opportunities for search engines to understand your content.\nOptimization Tips:\n*\nUse next-generation image formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF) for faster loading times.\n*\nProvide alternative text for images to improve accessibility.\n*\nOptimize video files and use video sitemaps to enhance search rankings.\n6. Secure and Accessible Website (HTTPS and ADA Compliance)\nGoogle prioritizes secure websites using HTTPS encryption, ensuring safe browsing for users. Websites without an SSL certificate may be flagged as unsafe, deterring users and harming rankings. Additionally, accessibility features such as readable fonts, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation enhance the user experience for all visitors and contribute to better SEO.\nEssential Security Measures:\n*\nInstall an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS encryption.\n*\nRegularly update software, plugins, and frameworks.\n*\nUse strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\n*\nImplement security headers to protect against attacks.\n7. Content Readability and Visual Appeal\nA well-designed website must also consider readability. Text should be easy to read, well-structured, and engaging. Proper use of whitespace, contrasting colors, and an organized layout keeps visitors engaged, reducing bounce rates and improving time-on-site metrics. Google rewards websites that provide value through high-quality, readable content.\nReadability Best Practices:\n*\nUse a clear, legible font with an appropriate size.\n*\nBreak up text with headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.\n*\nUse contrast between text and background for better readability.\n*\nImplement dark mode options for user convenience.\n8. Minimizing Pop-ups and Intrusive Interstitials\nGoogle penalizes websites that use excessive pop-ups [ https://kinsta.com/blog/google-mobile-popup-penalty/ ] or intrusive interstitials that hinder user experience. A clean, professional web design should focus on user engagement without aggressive disruptions, ensuring compliance with Google's guidelines for better rankings.\nTips to Use Pop-ups Effectively:\n*\nAvoid full-screen pop-ups that obscure content.\n*\nUse exit-intent pop-ups instead of immediate overlays.\n*\nKeep pop-ups relevant and provide easy close options.\n9. Schema Markup and Structured Data Implementation\nSchema markup helps search engines understand content better and can lead to rich search results like featured snippets.

By prioritizing a well-optimized web design, businesses can improve their search rankings, increase traffic, and drive conversions effectively. Investing in high-quality web design is not just about aesthetics-it's a fundamental element of digital success.\nBy implementing these web design strategies, businesses can create a seamless, engaging, and optimized experience that boosts their online presence and drives long-term success.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Intactdia\nContact Person: David Jones\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=intactdia-reveals-key-web-design-factors-for-improving-google-search-rankings ]\nAddress:1178 Broadway 3rd Floor\nCity: New York\nState: NY, 10001\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.intactdia.com\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
