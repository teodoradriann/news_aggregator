[Garvit Parashar](/anchors-and-authors/garvit-parashar/) [India](https://www.republicworld.com/india) - 2 min read Advertisement The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) recently announced a heartening milestone in their conservation efforts as they released two Himalayan Vultures back into the wild. The species, categorized as \"near endangered,\" found themselves in peril after being involved in a poisoning incident last March. However, thanks to the diligent care and rehabilitation provided by the BNHS team, these majestic birds were able to recover despite an extended period of rehabilitation. The release took place at VCBC-Rani, where a larger flock of Himalayan Vultures had been sighted, ensuring a supportive environment for the newly liberated birds. Prior to their freedom flight, both vultures underwent comprehensive health checks to ensure their readiness for reintroduction into their natural habitat. Additionally, the BNHS team took the precaution of fitting them with identification rings for monitoring purposes. The successful release of these vultures marks a significant victory in the ongoing battle to protect endangered species. With forest officials on hand to witness the event, it underscored the collaborative effort required for effective conservation. Advertisement Published February 16th, 2024 at 14:03 IST Your Voice.

    "text": "La importancia de la educación en términos de obtener más y mejores oportunidades laborales es una realidad. Hay muchas personas que por distintos motivos no han podido cursar o concluir el bachillerato, y ellas deben saber que siempre hay una alternativa para alcanzar las metas propuestas y superarse. Es sabido que concluir el nivel medio superior o bachillerato resulta un desafío para muchos, pues quizá les es necesario integrarse pronto al mercado laboral para apoyar económicamente a la familia, o tal vez en ese momento de juventud no percibían la relevancia de concluir estos estudios o les pareció difícil el programa académico. Sin importar el motivo, concluir el bachillerato puede ser un objetivo más fácil de alcanzar en la actualidad, y Unimedia, el Centro Universitario Megamedia, está dispuesto a ayudarte a hacer realidad este objetivo. El 9 de enero próximo Unimedia arrancará el primer curso de preparación para presentar el examen Ceneval de la SEP y así obtener el grado de bachiller. Karen Madrigal Ulín, responsable del área de vinculación de Unimedia, indica que el curso tiene una duración de dos meses, a lo largo de los cuales los alumnos recibirán capacitación y enseñanzas necesarias para aprobar el citado examen. Las clases serán en línea en vivo, lo que facilitará que cualquier persona, sin importar dónde se encuentre, pueda tomar el curso, que se impartirá los martes y jueves de 7 a 10 de la noche. Todas las sesiones de clases serán grabadas, por lo que si el alumno por algún motivo no puede conectarse a una sesión tendrá acceso a la grabación de la clase para que pueda ponerse al día. Los inscritos contarán con una guía de estudios y la asesoría de profesores altamente capacitados que son parte del personal de Unimedia. El programa abarca cinco áreas: Matemáticas, Ciencias Sociales, Humanidades, Ciencias Experimentales y Comunicación, que son las que marca el programa de estudios de la SEP respecto al bachillerato. Cualquier persona, incluso un menor de edad, puede tomar el curso y presentar el examen para obtener el grado de bachiller, aunque en el caso de los menores de edad éstos deben presentar un permiso de los padres y documentos personales. Para inscribirse al curso, los mayores de 18 años que deseen cursar o terminar la preparatoria deberán presentar credencial del INE, CURP, acta de nacimiento y certificado de secundaria. Al concluir los dos meses de preparación, Unimedia los guiará en el proceso de inscripción para presentar el examen de Ceneval. Cada alumno es responsable de realizar el trámite pertinente, pero la institución los apoyará en el proceso a manera de asesoría. Los alumnos que tomen el curso en Unimedia y obtengan su certificado de bachillerato tendrán acceso a becas especiales si deciden estudiar una licenciatura en el Centro Universitario Megamedia.
