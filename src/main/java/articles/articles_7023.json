    "text": "NEEDHAM, Mass. (WHDH) – A woman in Massachusetts is celebrating her 113th birthday. The reason she gave for making it so long may be surprising. At 113 years old, Herlda Senhouse may be the oldest resident in Massachusetts. The centenarian was born the same year as Lucille Ball and Ronald Reagan. The president at the time was William Howard Taft. It was also the year construction began on Fenway Park in Boston. During her birthday celebration, Senhouse was surrounded by loved ones at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Needham. She was honored with a special cane given to the oldest resident of her hometown in Wellesley. Senhouse’s friend, Margaret Robinson, was there to help celebrate. “She’s a lovely person and very kind, very giving, very inspirational, absolutely a wonderful person,” Robinson said. Senhouse was born in West Virginia before she moved to Massachusetts at a young age. “I’m so happy. It’s awesome,” she said. A fan of the slot machines, Senhouse said she is looking forward to her next trip to the casino. Senhouse said she credits living a more stress-free life as the reason for her longevity. “I didn’t have children,” she said. Copyright 2024 WHDH via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "El número de casos de sarampión en el oeste de Texas (EE.UU.) va en aumento, con al menos 58 infecciones reportadas, en lo que ya es el mayor brote de la enfermedad en el estado en los últimos 30 años.\nEl Departamento de Servicios de Salud del estado (DSHS, por sus siglas en inglés) ha reportado que, de los 58 casos que se conocen, 13 personas han sido hospitalizadas y solo 4 estaban vacunadas contra la enfermedad, altamente contagiosa y considerada erradicada de EE.UU. desde el año 2000.\nSin embargo, las autoridades sanitarias creen que el número real de casos es mayor: entre 200 y 300 contagios, según informó la cadena NBC .\nLos primeros casos de este brote, que empezaron a ser reportados en enero , tuvieron lugar en el condado de Gaines , una de las regiones con una tasa particularmente baja de vacunación. Desde entonces, la enfermedad se ha propagado a por lo menos tres condados contiguos.\nEn el año escolar 2023-2024, un 18 por ciento de los menores en edad pre-escolar en el estado no fueron vacunados, según datos recopilados por los Centros para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC).\nLa región afectada es conocida por ser hogar de la comunidad menonita, un grupo religioso cristiano de origen anabaptista.\nEl brote de sarampión se da en medio de un resurgimiento del movimiento anti-vacunas en la política estatal, con más de 20 proyectos de ley actualmente en consideración para suavizar las regulaciones sobre las vacunas y la vacunación.\nEl Senado confirmó la semana pasada a Robert F. Kennedy Jr, quien ha sido crítico de las vacunas, vinculándolas falsamente con el autismo, como director del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS).\nCon información de EFE",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nFestler wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.
