    "text": "Tras el escándalo de Argentina vs Marruecos por el primer partido de fútbol masculino en los [ Juegos Olímpicos,](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/deportes/los-hinchas-franceses-volvieron-a-abuchear-el-himno-de-argentina-en-los-juegos-olimpicos-y-sigue-la-polemica/) la ministra de Deportes de Francia, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra habló sobre lo sucedido pero de una forma insólita. La FIFA abrió una investigación tras el escándalo entre Argentina y Marruecos en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 La insólita frase de la ministra de Deportes de Francia tras el escándalo de Argentina vs Marruecos Después de la suspensión del encuentro por la invasión de los hinchas marroquíes y el reinicio del juego tras casi dos horas, la funcionaria dio su mirada sobre el bochornoso momento y aseguró que fue una “intrusión bastante bondadosa”. En declaraciones para la televisión francesa, la ministra de Deportes detalló: “En este partido de Saint-Etienne entre Marruecos y Argentina, hubo un pequeño momento de confusión, no quiero negarlo, pero estuvo ligado a una dificultad del arbitraje”. La AFA pedirá los puntos tras el escandaloso partido ante Marruecos en los Juegos Olímpicos y se amparan en un bochornoso antecedente del fútbol argentino Luego, agregó: “Fue una pequeña intrusión que no debió suceder, pero que era bastante bondadosa de la parte de los fanáticos marroquíes”, y sumó: “Hubo un largo tiempo de detención en el que hubo un poco de tergiversación en el plano de arbitraje”. Con respecto a los problemas de organización de los Juegos Olímpicos, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra cerró: “Un análisis fue hecho entre el comité de organización y la FIFA. Todo va a estar en orden. Habrá un próximo partido entre Ucrania y Marruecos el sábado próximo en Saint-Etienne. Todo será absolutamente genial”. El duro comunicado de Chiqui Tapia tras el escándalo en Argentina vs Marruecos en los Juegos Olímpicos: “Va contra las reglas” La AFA pedirá los puntos tras el escandaloso partido ante Marruecos en los Juegos Olímpicos y se amparan en un bochornoso antecedente del fútbol argentino En un duro comunicado tras la polémica, el presidente de la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino informó que elevaron un reclamo formal a la Comisión Disciplinaria de la FIFA “para que se tomen las medidas reglamentarias pertinentes y se imponga una sanción a quien o quienes corresponda”. La justificación del reclamo es, resumidamente, que el partido no debía reanudarse. Si eso sucedía, el agónico gol de Medina no podía ser anulado y el seleccionado nacional rescataba un punto en la última jugada del encuentro.",

    "text": "With 2023 drawing to a close, we take a look back at our most downloaded whitepapers, sentiment papers and surveys over the course of the past year. These reports are Finextra-led and cobranded, based on editorially balanced, independent, referenced desk-based and online research.\nTop research reports of 2023\n5. From Cloud to Multicloud, Pathway to Resilience\nThis industry survey, conducted by Finextra in association with Form3, which was designed to glean the general attitude and approach multi-cloud infrastructure, perceived benefits and perceived challenges around implementation. Notably, it sought to establish the general awareness of various new and incoming regulations around resilience and systemic risk, of how cloud and cloud providers can navigate this and how much, if any, business opportunity firms see in resilience and risk compliance.\n4. Can FIs lead the World’s ESG charge with Pioneering and Transparent Data Visualisation?\nThis Finextra report takes a view on the rapidly unfolding story of ESG within banking and financial services at large. Regulation is being dramatically reshaped such that financial organisations become increasingly obligated to make consciously ethical investment decisions, becoming responsible for non-compliant ESG parties in their own value chains. However, different rules and formats apply in different countries, which causes significant compliance challenges.\n3. Customer Experience – Is Hyperpersonalisation the next frontier?\nThis Finextra survey, produced in association with SoftServe and conducted in late 2022/early 2023, aimed to quantify priorities and ambitions in financial services with regard to improving the digital experience of services for the customer, and to what extent services have or will become personalised, or even hyperpersonalised. The findings show a genuine and growing appetite by banks and other financial service providers to invest more in making customers’ online engagements easier and more fulfilling.\n2. Embracing Technology to shape the Future of Digital Banking\nThis whitepaper, produced in association with Worldline, explores the current landscape of models and what factors may influence further evolution. There has been a tidal wave of transformation – the pace of it is accelerating, technology is proliferating, and customer behaviour and expectation are advancing all the time; the banking industry is in flux and it is a challenging time but also an exciting one.\n1. Payments Modernisation: The Big Survey 2023\nThis Finextra survey, produced in association with Volante Technologies, builds on the previous 2021 and 2022 industry surveys. The latest 2023 edition captures and examines ongoing priorities within payments modernisation, with a particular focus on the growth or need for partnerships and cloud-facilitated account-to-account (A2A) payment applications and payments-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings. The report analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of the status and adoption of real-time payment networks within domestic markets and increasingly through intra-regional schemes and cross-border networks globally.\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "text": "San José, 28 dic (EFE).- El sacerdote nicaragüense Carlos Áviles, vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, capital de Nicaragua, fue detenido este jueves por la Policía en medio de tensiones entre el Gobierno del presidente Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica, denunció la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina.\n\"El Ministerio del Interior amanece realizando su primera arbitrariedad. Han secuestrado a monseñor Carlos Avilés, vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, quien en años anteriores declaró que el presidente Daniel Ortega miente al decir que en Nicaragua hay libertad\", denunció Molina, autora del estudio titulado 'Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?', a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).\nLa opositora Unidad Nacional Azul y Blanco también denunció la detención del sacerdote de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, que dirige el cardenal nicaragüense, Leopoldo Brenes, quien aún no se refiere a esa denuncia.\n\"Otro zarpazo represivo de la dictadura contra la Iglesia católica. Su secuestro se suma al encarcelamiento del obispo Isidoro Mora, dos sacerdotes y dos seminaristas en los últimos días\", indicó la Unidad Nacional en una declaración.\nEn el caso de Mora, obispo de la diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, quien fue encarcelado junto a dos seminaristas, fue detenido el 20 de diciembre un día después de invocar en una homilía al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nNi el Gobierno que preside Daniel Ortega ni la Policía Nacional ha confirmado o negado la presunta detención de otro sacerdote.\nEn el caso de Mora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en cadena nacional lo calificó de \"soberbio\", \"desquiciado\" y \"energúmeno\".\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas, y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.EFE\nmg/rao/laa",
