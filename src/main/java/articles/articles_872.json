    "text": "King Charles has reportedly given royal aides the green light to prepare for a tour of Australia.\nThis comes as his\ncancer treatment appears to be having positive effects, two months after he publicly confirmed his diagnosis after undergoing treatment for an enlarged prostate.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: The King to visit Australia.\nStream the world's best reality, entertainment and true-crime shows free on\n7plus\nThe King, 75, and his wife\nQueen Camilla, 76, are set to return to Australian shores in October.\n“The King is raring to go and keen to get on with the job,” a palace source told\nThe Sun.\nThe source reported the King is “over the moon” with how his treatment is progressing, prompting the King’s team to “supercharge” the Australia plans.\n“He knows he can’t hang around and is feeling extremely positive after tests meant he could attend the\nEaster Sunday service and spend time meeting the public, which he has missed,” the source said.\n“Although his doctors are keeping an eye on his\nhealth, he’s itching to take the reins and get back to his public role as head of state.\n“He wants to follow his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s mantra, that he needs to be seen to be believed.”\nThe King and Queen are set to embark on a two-week trip across Australia, New Zealand and Samoa.\nHowever, the insider reports the itinerary will be stripped back to allow for more downtime, ensuring the King has enough recovery between commitments.\nIt was announced in February that the King has been receiving treatment for cancer after undergoing a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate.\nWhile he kept a low profile following the news, Charles and Camilla made a significant public appearance at an\nEaster Service last weekend, shaking hands and speaking with onlookers.\nThe milestone was a major positive sign of his recovery.\nThe King’s most recent visit to Australia was as the Prince of Wales in 2018, for the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane.\nHe has previously made the trip to Australia at least 15 times, with official visits to every state and territory, as well as attending Geelong Grammar School’s Timbertop campus as a student in 1966.\nIt is believed Charles’ visit could coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Samoa in October.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese released a statement on March 4 about preparations for King Charles to tour Down Under.\n“The King has shown his compassion for Australians affected by recent natural disasters, just as Australians have shown compassion and support for the King following his cancer diagnosis,” he said.\n“The King, Queen, and members of the royal family are always welcome in Australia.”\nThe late\nQueen Elizabeth II last came to Australia in 2011, visiting Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra.\nElizabeth, who died in 2022, currently remains the only serving monarch to have made the trip to Australia — visiting 16 times throughout her reign.\nStream free on",

    "text": "Vídeos relacionados:\nEm meio à grave crise energética que afeta os cubanos, a quebra de um tubo de gás manufaturado agrava a situação para os residentes em dois municípios de Havana, onde o fornecimento de combustível doméstico será interrompido até que o trecho danificado seja substituído nos próximos dias.\nA Empresa de Gás Manufaturado anunciou nesta quarta-feira em um comunicado que, devido a uma falha, será substituído um trecho de tubulação na avenida 51, entre 96 e 100, para “garantir a estabilidade do serviço de gás na rede Playa-Marianao”.\nPara executar os trabalhos, será realizada uma \"parada total\" da planta de produção #2, entre às 22 horas da próxima sexta-feira, 9 de maio, e às 4 horas da manhã de sábado, 10, o que afetará completamente o serviço nos municípios de Playa e Marianao, indicou a entidade.\nA empresa vinculada à petrolífera estatal CUPET pediu desculpas à população afetada pelas “inconvenientes que esta interrupção possa causar” e assegurou que mantém seu “compromisso de oferecer um serviço de qualidade aos seus clientes”.\nOs problemas com o serviço de gás manufaturado na capital são parte da aguda crise energética que sofre Cuba, na qual também impactam a escassez de gás liquefeito em todo o país e os constantes e prolongados apagões.\nNo final de abril, a planta de produção #1 (Melones) de gás manufaturado em Havana interrompeu o serviço nos municípios de Plaza de la Revolución, Havana Velha, Centro Havana, Cerro e Diez de Octubre, para realizar trabalhos de manutenção “imprescindíveis”. Um mês antes, a indústria também havia realizado outra parada inadiável para “garantir a estabilidade do gás” nos cinco municípios.\nEnquanto isso, a escassez de gás liquefeito continua a prejudicar a vida cotidiana de grande parte da população cubana, e o governo não fornece uma solução para meses de falta do combustível.\nDesde há meses, os cidadãos têm enfrentado longas filas para tentar comprar gás, esperando durante horas ou dias sem sucesso.\nSem nenhuma outra alternativa, milhares de famílias se viram obrigadas a cozinhar com lenha e carvão, diante da falta de combustíveis básicos.\nHace menos de duas semanas, CUPET confirmou que persiste a escassez de gás liquefeito devido à falta de suprimentos. “A até o momento não entrou nenhum barco de gás liquefeito e continua o déficit a nível de país”, afirmou a Unidade Empresarial de Base de Distribuição de Combustíveis Camagüey, em um comunicado divulgado expressamente para esclarecer uma confusão que circulava nas redes sociais.\nPerguntas frequentes sobre a interrupção do serviço de gás em Havana\nPor que o fornecimento de gás será interrompido em dois municípios de Havana?\nA interrupção do fornecimento de gás manufaturado nos municípios de Playa e Marianao se deve à quebra de um tubo. A Empresa de Gás Manufaturado indicou que será realizada uma \"parada total\" da planta de produção #2 para substituir o trecho danificado, com o objetivo de garantir a estabilidade do serviço. Isso faz parte da crise energética que afeta Cuba, onde a escassez de gás liquefeito e os apagões são comuns.\nQuanto tempo durará a interrupção do serviço de gás em Havana?\nA interrupção do serviço de gás está programada para começar na noite de sexta-feira, 9 de maio, e espera-se que termine na madrugada de sábado, 10 de maio. A Empresa de Gás Fabricado estima que o serviço será restabelecido nos próximos dias após a substituição do trecho danificado.\nComo a crise energética em Cuba afeta os cidadãos?\nA crise energética em Cuba gerou múltiplos problemas para a população, incluindo a escassez de gás liquefeito e apagões prolongados. Os cidadãos enfrentam longas filas para adquirir gás e, diante da falta de suprimentos, muitos se veem obrigados a recorrer a métodos alternativos como o uso de lenha e carvão para cozinhar. Esta situação deteriorou a qualidade de vida e aumentou a frustração entre os cubanos.\nQuais medidas a Empresa de Gás Manufaturado está tomando para resolver a situação?\nA Empresa de Gás Manufacturado anunciounciou que realizará a substituição do trecho danificado do tubo na avenida 51 para garantir a estabilidade do serviço de gás. Além disso, expressaram seu compromisso em oferecer um serviço de qualidade a seus clientes e pediram desculpas pelos inconvenientes que a interrupção possa causar. No entanto, a solução a longo prazo ainda é incerta devido à persistente crise energética no país.\nArquivado em:",

    "title": "Police call new license plate cameras around metro Detroit a 'game changer'",
    "text": "By Faraz Javed ,\n52 minutes ago A new type of license plate reader cameras are being used across metro Detroit to apprehend criminals.\n\"They are just tracking license plates to give us leads in our investigations,\" said Taylor Police Chief John Blair.\nSince the beginning of this year, 50 of the cameras have been installed across Taylor and another 27 on patrol cars. Chief Blair says the cutting-edge technology has been a game changer.\n\"It gives us an advantage. Vehicles are used in more than 80 percent of crimes. We know criminals use those to facilitate their crimes, and if we can get the license plates, it's going to help catch them,\" he said.\nThe city-funded camera system clocks in around 9 million license plate reads a month.\n\"This month in May we had 220+ vehicles that have been wanted. We have used Flock to solve all sorts of crime,\" he said.\nThese cameras have also helped in the recovery of stolen vehicles. Body cam showed an officer receiving an alert from the Flock cameras about a stolen vehicle, and then, a traffic stop is made. As per Taylor police, since the installation of the Flock cameras, they are now recovering up to 10 stolen vehicles a month.\n\"If we want to do surveillance on somebody. If we knew what car they were coming in from, instead of running an entire team of 6-8 officers in cars, we can actually track that offender as they move from location to location,\" he said.\nBut Joseph Holme, who frequently visits the city's Heritage Park, says this is the first time he has noticed the cameras and feels more needs to be done to create awareness.\n\"Like this guy here, he doesn't know that his license plate is being read even though it's for public safety, that I understand. The question is, what else can it be used for?\" asked Holme.\nYes, with great power comes great responsibility. I met with Lt. Jeff Adamisin to get more information about the cameras.\n\"So, the plates are state owned, the plates and the vehicles are not protected, and this camera is only taking pictures of vehicles and the plate. It's not taking any pictures of drivers or passengers. It eliminates the right to privacy. Because as we are driving down the road, we are all able to see vehicles that are passing us,\" said Lt. Adamisin.\nLt. Adamisin says the cameras are real-time and are also being used in other cities across metro Detroit.\n\"I have 6,300 different cameras throughout the United States,\" said Lt. Adamisin.\nHe showed me this map of Flock cameras across the country and as you zoom in, there's Michigan and metro Detroit.\n\"You got to remember these vehicles traveling 45 to 50 miles an hour and their newest cameras are good for 100 miles an hour,\" he said.\nMoreover, the police can also use the technology to search for vehicles without a plate by just typing the car's description.\nACLU's Liz Balck has been studying the Flock camera system.\nBalck says there are talks of a statewide statute; if passed, all law enforcement agencies will have to discard the collected data after the pre-determined timeframe.\n\"A policy that we would see is that Flock may not sell or share that data, even the government, except for limited situations like warrants or on-going investigations,\" said Balck.\nFor people who are concerned about privacy, Lt. Adamisin says, \"Now that the information stored within this program is only kept for 30 days, so we are not sharing this information, Flock doesn't share this information.\"\nTo learn more about the Flock system, go here.\nWhere Your Voice Matters\nContact our newsroom Have a tip, story idea or comment on our coverage?

    "title": "高管控家长正批量生产不婚不育的年轻人，也更容易让孩子成年后陷入PUA|上海市_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "“今天我不管孩子，孩子的学业就会不好，未来就考不上好大学，孩子就会找不到好工作，就不能拥有好的生活……”这是很多父母在日常生活中都曾经考虑过的问题、曾经说过的话，甚至有父母会引申到“孩子没有好工作，未来很可能找不到满意的对象”“孩子未来在自己的小家庭中会没有地位”……当你总是这样想、这样说的时候，那么你很可能在这类思维逻辑支配下，陷入对孩子采取高管控养育模式的陷阱。但很多人会认为，大多数父母都是如此思考的，这有什么错？事实上，父母对孩子，尤其是对青少年的高管控，其影响很可能比我们想象的更深远。笔者团队近年来围绕中国父母的高管控养育模式进行了系列研究，发现父母高管控影响的不仅是孩子的学习习惯、身心健康，甚至还会影响孩子成年之后的婚恋状况。\n父母面对不确定，往往身不由己\n根据发展心理学的观点，幼儿园阶段的孩子最重要的“工作”应该是游戏，儿童总是在游戏中发展认知和社交能力。而知识类学习应该是小学阶段才开始，世界各国不论是什么国情，小学都是在差不多同样的年龄段开始，因为这是无数科学研究验证的结果。但事实上，现在绝大多数孩子在幼儿园阶段就已经开始严格的书本知识学习，他们进入小学时都已经能够熟练书写和流利阅读。这些都是源于父母的“付出”。在生活中稍加观察，我们就可以发现很多父母正“揠苗”式地抓知识类教育，比如，4岁孩子的父母希望孩子熟练掌握20以内加减法，5岁孩子的父母为孩子不能熟练计算100以内加减法而着急。但是，学龄前儿童不论从认知水平还是注意力特征来看，显然在知识学习方面不容易达到父母的期望。于是，父母对孩子的高管控通常从幼儿园阶段就开始了。从家庭教育的角度而言，多数父母当然都懂得对孩子管得太多，让孩子没有自主成长的空间，会严重影响他的成长，但是父母为什么依然会这样做？而且为什么我们在与父母交流中，即便是高管控的父母也从来不会认为自己对孩子的管控过高，这是为什么？我们的研究发现，高管控的父母很多时候真的确实是“身不由己”，所谓身不由己，是因为大环境让很多父母“不得不”这样做，即面对未来的很多不确定性——整个环境的不确定以及孩子未来发展前景的不确定，父母的压力快速增加，这让他们不由自主地采取了高度管控的养育模式。\n高管控更容易让孩子成年后陷入PUA\n作为学者，我们关心的问题是，在中国如此多的父母从孩子年幼就开始了以知识灌输为主导的高管控的养育，到底会带来什么样的后果？首先是年轻人的生育意愿。调查发现，中国当代年轻人的生育意愿呈明显降低趋势。从人口学研究的角度来看，经济发展水平越高，教育竞争压力越大，孩子长大之后的生育意愿就越低。对很多父母而言，他们也许会认为自己花费了很多精力和资源养育孩子、“卷”孩子，是为了孩子未来有更圆满的生活。但结果却是，孩子读了很好的大学，学历提升很高，但是毕业后却不想结婚、不想生育孩子。这正是父母对孩子养育过度卷入的后果之一。当然，对比国外的数据，中国的数据相对乐观。上海近期人口普查结果显示，49岁女性没有生育孩子的比例是1/20，42岁女性没有生育孩子的比例是1/10。而日本目前超过1/4的女性一辈子都没有生育孩子。在一些发达国家，这个数字甚至达到27.4%。就目前而言，以上海为例的中国女性生育率还不算太低。但10年、20年之后，中国女性的未生育率会达到什么水平，需要持更谨慎的态度。此外，很多父母希望孩子能够成为自律的人。他们通常会通过管控的约束来帮助孩子建立自律。但对青少年而言，父母的高管控很难达到相应的效果。以网络成瘾为例，高管控父母对孩子沉迷手机的第一应对办法通常是“看得更紧一点”“控制得再严一些”，甚至把孩子的手机藏起来，乃至一怒之下砸碎。事实上，这种管控模式下，孩子对网络的使用管理不会变得更自律，网络成瘾行为也不会改善，甚至只会恶化。与高管控父母的做法不同的另一种应对模式是当孩子网络成瘾、缺乏自律的时候，不是去管控孩子，而是“父母更加爱你，对你的情感关注更多”。事实上，这是有效的应对模式。因为人类每一个个体都需要情感的滋养，从儿童到成年人，情感关注都是一个人精神的营养剂，也是他们抵抗外部问题的重要支持力量。我们追踪研究的结果也非常明确：应对孩子的不自律或者网瘾，如果父母采取的是高管控方式，也就是常说的“直升机养育模式”，那么半年后孩子的自律和网瘾行为不会有任何改变。而当父母给孩子更多情感上的关注、沟通和互动时，或者在情感上给孩子更多接纳时，孩子的网瘾会减弱，自律能力也会变得更好。当我们把研究视野拓宽，我们又发现，青少年时期被父母高管控的孩子，成年后建立亲密关系模式时同样也会受到影响。尤其是那种父母自我感觉对孩子管控不多，但孩子感觉父母对自己管控过多的家庭。这样的孩子在成年后更容易在亲密关系中成为掌控对方或者被对方掌控的那个人，即通常所说的PUA（隐性心理操控）对方或者被对方PUA，而不是构建平等的亲密关系。不过，令人意外的是，那些父母觉得自己对孩子管控比较多而孩子有同感，或者父母和孩子都觉得父母管控不多的家庭，这些孩子在成年后的浪漫关系模式并没有受到影响。这意味着，孩子成年后建构关系是否被影响，重要因素是孩子本身是否感受到被父母高度管控。\n那些高管控父母可以这样识别\n我们所说管控的标准是针对孩子，其实随着年龄的增长，父母对孩子的管控也在不断调整，处于动态平衡中。所谓高管控，判断往往基于父母与孩子的互动模式。大多数青春期亲子关系特别不好的家庭，父母都是高管控父母。那么高管控父母在孩子早期是不是有迹可循呢？这些高管控的家长在孩子年幼时，又有什么样的表现呢？\n心理学的研究发现，在孩子年幼时，高管控父母通常会过度关注，甚至是溺爱孩子。这些父母在孩子年幼时更有可能展现出“密集母职”，简言之，就是养育孩子已经成为她/他的一个职业，他们自己全方位地把养育孩子作为职业，并且对孩子过度投入。我们发现，那些特别爱晒孩子的家长往往是高管控家长。\n虽然陪伴是孩子成长过程中特别重要的一件事，但过犹不及，对孩子陪伴过多，对孩子关注过多的这类家长，在孩子进入青春期后，往往进入到一种新的养育模式，就是高度管控，其背后的心态就是生怕孩子有一点闪失。所以随着孩子年龄的不同，高管控父母的养育模式即便不一样，但其核心点不变，就是太爱、太重视、太关注孩子，把孩子看得特别重要。\n事实上，更有利于孩子发展的应该是家长在与孩子的亲子互动中，更关注情感互动，尤其是提供给孩子情感的支持、接纳和互动，让孩子拥有自身前行和发展的动力。\n虽然当下所有人的焦虑水平比10年前、20年前要都会增加，我们对大环境的改善也许有限，但是，让我们每个人都可以尽可能从优化自己的家庭环境开始，改善焦虑、内卷。\n（作者为复旦大学心理学系教授，本报记者姜澎采访整理）\n原标题：高管控家长正批量生产不婚不育的年轻人，也更容易让孩子成年后陷入PUA",
