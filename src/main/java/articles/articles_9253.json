    "title": "Polémica por los casamientos entre primos en Salta: desde el registro civil aclararon la situación",
    "text": "Salta ha sido sorprendida por un anuncio notable del Registro Civil provincial: el matrimonio entre primos de segundo grado de consanguinidad es legal. María Fernanda Ubiergo, subsecretaría del Registro Civil de Salta, confirmó esta información durante una entrevista con el medio FM Profesional. Según ella, el Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación (CCC) autoriza el matrimonio entre primos de segundo grado, que son los hijos de primos hermanos, perteneciendo a la misma generación y compartiendo bisabuelos. Las declaraciones de Ubiergo provocaron una gran controversia en Salta, lo que lo llevó a aclarar sus comentarios para evitar malentendidos. En una entrevista con CNN Radio Salta, explicó que no se refería al matrimonio entre primos de segundo grado, aunque señaló que “siempre han podido casarse”. En este contexto, enfatizó que sigue en vigor la prohibición de casarse con cuñados o exsuegros. “El parentesco por afinidad se refiere a la relación entre una persona casada y los familiares de su pareja”, comentó Ubiergo al citar el artículo 536 del Código Civil y Comercial. Entre los ejemplos mencionados se encuentran las relaciones entre suegros y yernos o nueras, así como entre sobrinos y tíos políticos. De este modo, la normativa aborda tanto los vínculos biológicos como los jurídicos. Además, precisó que las uniones prohibidas son aquellas en las que existe parentesco en línea recta por consanguinidad, es decir, entre ascendientes y descendientes como padres, hijos, abuelos y bisabuelos. También están excluidos del matrimonio por afinidad los suegros, los abuelos de los suegros, nueras, yernos, cuñados y los hermanos en segundo grado de consanguinidad.",

    "text": "Defending the U.S. against an attack on its satellites may be another day on the job for Space Force Sgt. Robert Brown, but he admits to getting a little sweaty when guardians undertook their first orbital warfare simulation in December.\nThe four-day Red Skies exercise, hosted by Space Training and Readiness Command’s 392nd Combat Training Squadron, intended to flex the muscles of Delta 9 Guardians who are training to defend U.S. satellite systems that form the\nbackbone of American military operations.\n“Our strategic competitors are preparing space capabilities to find and target and attack our terrestrial forces, right? We know they’re planning and building to deny, degrade our space capabilities as well. So our nation’s responding,” Brig. Gen. Todd Moore, deputy commander of STARCOM, told Air Force Times.\nThough details are classified, more than three dozen guardians from Deltas 9, 2, 3, 7 and 11 worked together for the first time through a simulated exercise to maintain tactical command and control of several satellites while building awareness of what physical and digital threats might be lurking.\n“Not all plans survive,” Brown, a member of Delta 9, which focuses on orbital warfare, said of the exercise. “On-the-fly planning is essential for crews to understand how to get after and how to accomplish [the mission].”\nRed Skies followed a series of electronic warfare-focused\n Black Skies exercises, which began in September 2022. A cyber warfare exercise, Blue Skies, is expected later this year.\nThe exercises also come as Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman seeks to boost the service’s combat readiness through more\nrobust and realistic operational test and training infrastructure, including by building live ranges and investing in mission-specific simulators, while accelerating the tempo and increasing the scope of exercises. The results of those exercises will shape the force’s development and design.\nIn the past, Saltzman said, readiness metrics reflected whether troops could operate military space systems unthreatened. That has changed.\n“It will no longer be sufficient to fight for space superiority against our pacing threat. We have provided space effects with impunity for decades. … These days are over,” Saltzman said in a Feb. 13 keynote speech at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Air Warfare Symposium.\nBecause it’s rare for deltas to work together, crew integration and coordination between them during Red Skies was a top priority for Capt. DeShawna Moore, the 392nd CTS’ lead exercise planner.\n“My overall objective was seeing that play out, and seeing where the efficiency is to help direct where the training or where Red Skies goes next,” Moore said.\nRELATED\nRed Skies is one of several events that the Space Force will use as it builds toward running several simultaneous exercises in what 392nd CTS Commander Lt. Col. Scott Nakatani called a “cohesive space sortie.”\n“We need to catch up to that level of proficiency that all the other services have in operating in their domain in support of the combatant commanders’ [operational] plan,” Nakatani said.\nWhile there’s no date set for the overarching exercise, Moore and Nakatani said they hope to introduce live fire into the next Red Skies simulation, which could come in fiscal year 2025.\nCourtney Mabeus-Brown is the senior reporter at Air Force Times. She is an award-winning journalist who previously covered the military for Navy Times and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va., where she first set foot on an aircraft carrier.

    "text": "Southeastern services in Kent are being 'severely delayed' between Ebbsfleet and Stratford due to flooding in one of the tunnels under the Thames. The incident is causing signalling problem which means trains in both directions are forced to only use one line. Passengers can expect delays of up to 50 minutes, according to Southeastern Railway. People have been told to use alternative routes into London. A Southeastern spokesperson said: \"Our highspeed services are being severely delayed between Ebbsfleet and Stratford and are likely to be altered at short notice which may include terminating at a station before their destination, or starting at an alternative station.\" READ MORE: [Kent weather: Met Office issues 16-hour wind warning for New Year weekend with 75mph gusts](https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/kent-weather-met-office-issues-9003054) READ MORE: [Man who lives in his Ford Fiesta spends ‘perfect Christmas’ alone in Kent woods](https://www.kentlive.news/news/real-life/man-who-lives-ford-fiesta-9001236) Those travelling this afternoon (December 29) can use services from Charing Cross or London Bridge for trains between London and Gravesend, Ashford, Folkestone, Dover, Ramsgate and Canterbury West.
