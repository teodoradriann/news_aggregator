    "text": "A University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist is participating in a U.S. government effort to design a satellite and instruments capable of detecting space debris as small as 1 centimeter, less than one-half inch.\nDebris that small, which cannot currently be detected from the ground, can damage satellites and other spacecraft in low-Earth orbit.\nThe idea is to outfit future satellites, such as those vital for communication systems, with technology to avoid space debris collisions.\nSpace debris travels at high speeds, about 17,500 mph. A 1-centimeter object traveling at that speed has an impact energy equivalent to that of a small explosive such as a hand grenade.\nSpace debris comes in many shapes and sizes and consists of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, fragments from collisions, and other human-made objects that no longer serve a purpose.\nUAF Geophysical Institute research professor Paul Bernhardt and colleagues from the University of Calgary in Canada have devised a method to determine a small object's distance from a satellite or spacecraft and the angle of its approach.\nThe method is based on their discovery that an object in orbit creates waves as it passes through naturally occurring plasma disturbances — known as striations — that occur along Earth's magnetic field lines. Plasma is a gas-like state of matter made of free-floating negative electrons and positive ions.\nBernhardt and colleagues are developing the instruments that would use that method. He also is designing the satellite that will carry the instruments for this initial test. He calls it the Space Debris Hunter.\n\"The whole satellite will be dedicated to detection of space debris too small to be seen from the ground,\" he said.\nThe direction to a piece of space debris would be determined by an on-board sensor that simultaneously measures electric and magnetic wave fields to detect signals emanating from the space object. A separate sensor would record changes in signal frequency over time. Analysis of these data would then be used to determine direction and distance to the space debris to reveal its location.\n\"Several measurements of this type are sufficient to predict the future path of the debris,\" Bernhardt said. \"That's the new science we're exploring.\"\nThat knowledge will allow satellites to be steered away from the path of the debris, Bernhardt said, adding that operators of the Starlink system take more 20,000 collision avoidance actions per year.\nThe new detection method was detailed in a Jan. 8 paper in Physics of Plasmas . Bengt Eliasson of the University of Strathclyde in Great Britain is the lead author.\nThe work is part of a U.S. government effort to track space debris. It is based on work supported in part by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. It was performed in collaboration with contractor Blue Halo in the IARPA Space Debris Identification and Tracking program.\nThe U.S. debris-tracking program estimates that more than 100 million objects greater than 1 millimeter in size orbit Earth but that less than 1 percent of debris that can cause mission-ending damage is tracked. Because of that, the program's website states, \"there is an increased interest\" in tracking small debris.\nhere.",

    "text": "By Julia Donovan ,\n3 hours ago KRDO MANITOU SPRINGS, Colo. (KRDO) - Manitou Springs Police confirmed with KRDO Thursday that Manitou Springs Elementary School was evacuated again. Officials believe this go around, it was because the vacuum used to clean up a suspicious powder substance after the first evacuation had not been emptied properly.\nWe're told the evacuation Thursday morning was due to staff on the basement level of the school coughing and experiencing watery eyes. One staff member was checked out by medics who arrived at the school, but did not go to the hospital, according to a statement from the school.\nThis comes after the elementary school was evacuated Tuesday for similar circumstances where students were reportedly suffering coughing fits and burning eye s in the school's auditorium.\nManitou Springs Elementary School released a statement saying in part \"a visible powder was found in the Manitou Springs Elementary School auditorium, where 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students were present... The auditorium was closed until it could be deep cleaned, which happened on the evening of Wednesday, December 18.\"\nSome of the powder substance that is believed to have caused the symptoms was still in the vacuum, and when it was turned back on Thursday, the powder dispersed again, Commander Corey Sevene with the Manitou Springs Police Department told KRDO.\nCommander Sevene told KRDO over the phone Thursday that the substance has been sent to the Colorado Bureau of Investigations for further testing after preliminary testing could not identify the powder.\nKRDO13 is still working to confirm what the powder could have possibly been. During the first evacuation, the district also reported that there was a smell, with one student telling KRDO13 it smelt like gas.\nManitou Springs Elementary School will be closed Friday for another deep cleaning, according to school officials.\nThe post Manitou Springs Elementary evacuated for 2nd time, likely over powder substance in vacuum appeared first on KRDO .",

    "title": "AI divide could deepen existing disparities, warns study",
    "text": "A new report from the US-based National League of Cities (NLC), in collaboration with Google, highlights how cities across the US are using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance services and address local challenges.\nThe AI in Cities report explores how municipalities leverage AI for improved public safety, efficient traffic systems, and enhanced citizen services. Featuring contributions from NLC’s AI Advisory Committee, the publication provides a toolkit that guides local leaders on adopting AI in ways that are practical and sensitive to community needs.\n“Technology has always been an essential tool to help local governments respond to the changing needs of their residents,” said Clarence Anthony, CEO and Executive Director, National League of Cities. “Our Artificial Intelligence report is a collection of both the potential pitfalls and the overwhelming opportunities that exist for our local communities with AI.”\nOne of the report’s central themes is the importance of addressing the “AI divide”—a growing gap between cities with ample digital infrastructure and those lacking it. Many AI tools rely on high-speed internet and advanced data centres, resources more readily available in larger or wealthier cities.\nThis disparity risks leaving smaller, or underfunded areas at a disadvantage, as they struggle to implement the same technological advancements accessible to more digitally connected cities. As a result, the report warns that this divide could deepen existing inequities, affecting education, transport, public safety, and overall community well-being.\nTo bridge this divide, the study emphasises the need for intentional policies to ensure equitable access to AI technology. Cities are encouraged to involve diverse community voices in AI planning and implementation, allowing local residents to play a role in shaping how these technologies are used.\nFor instance, Seattle has implemented a Racial Equity Toolkit that requires city departments to assess AI tools for potential biases, helping ensure that AI supports fairness across all communities. Such frameworks are deemed essential, as they address risks of discrimination and help prevent AI from unintentionally reinforcing existing social disparities.\nThe analysis also underscores the importance of building digital literacy among city staff and residents. Partnering with educational institutions and private-sector entities, cities can create foundational training programmes that empower individuals to understand and responsibly utilise AI.\nThese initiatives aim to ensure that marginalised communities are not left behind as AI becomes a staple in public services. Ultimately, the review advocates for policies and practices that make AI accessible to all, urging cities to host public forums, develop feedback mechanisms, and foster transparency to build resident trust in AI applications.\nImage: NLC",

    "text": "Every point matters in Iowa's National Duals victory\nTalk about making an entrance on the biggest stage.\nThe first-ever Iowa Hawkeye women’s wrestling team did just that on Friday and Saturday at the UNI-Dome – nabbing the first of what many hope (and expect) to be countless national championship honors going forward.\nOn this first-ever occasion that just so happened to encompass the NWCA National Duals at which the best of the best teams from across NCAA women’s wrestling gathered in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\nIn the end, it would be the Hawkeyes who prevailed, capping a 4-0 run through the tournament bracket with a dramatic 21-20 victory over North Central College (IL) in the finals on Saturday afternoon.\nBut before breaking down the championship bout heroics (and there were more than few), here’s a quick look back at how Iowa was able to navigate its path just to get there:\nFriday’s Action\nA 49-1 opening round rout over 15-seed Adrian College (MI) somewhat belies the admirable fight put up by the opposing Bulldogs – particularly in the early going. But by dual’s end the Hawkeyes had amassed bonus point wins across all 10 weights, including seven pins, two forfeits and one victory by technical fall.\nNext up, seventh-seeded Presbyterian, whom Iowa faced nearly two months prior at the program’s inaugural home duals inside of Carver-Hawkeye Arena.\nTurns out that even 50-plus days later not much had really changed other than a few names in the Hawkeye lineup. The ‘sequel’ to November’s 44-1 trouncing was a 39-4 victory to advance Iowa into the semi-finals.\nThe highlights of the dual included two Iowa back-ups notching wins over top-10 opponents – Ava Rose over #10 Alyssa Mahan (4-2) at 123 pounds and #3 Haley Ward over 10th-ranked Henlee Haynes (10-0) at 170 pounds – while another, #2 Ella Schmit, earned a measure of belated revenge over Presbyterian 143-pounder Madeline Kubicki.\nLast April it was Kubicki who prevailed over the Bettendorf, Iowa native Schmit for a spot on the U.S. Under-20 World Championship team – taking two-out-of-three matches in wild back-and-forth affair.\nOn this latest occasion Schmit fought back from an early 4-0 deficit courtesy of a few gritty takedowns and took her first lead of the match with barely a minute remaining in the second period. Hardly satisfied, she then muscled Kubicki over for the fall shortly thereafter.\nOne last notable development was the season debut of 191-pound junior Jaycee Foeller.\nThe previous two-time national finalist at both McKendree (IL) and Central Methodist University (MO) had been presumed to be spending the 2023-24 season in redshirt at Iowa due to her status as a second-time transfer athlete. But with that NCAA stipulation now tied up in the courts – and perhaps ultimately unenforceable – Foeller was able to step into the Hawkeye lineup for the first time this weekend.\nIn totality Friday’s pair of duals resulted in 19/20 match wins for Iowa, 18 of which were accompanied with some form of bonus points.\nNot too shabby.\nSaturday semi-finals\nIts first dual on Saturday morning would see the Hawkeyes pitted against #3 seed King University (TN), the two-time reigning champions of this event.\nThrough four bouts, what had been a thoroughly competitive showing on the mat was not nearly so on the team scoreboard. Iowa would hold a 14-0 advantage thanks to a fall at 101 pounds by #2 Sterling Dias over King’s #6 Mia Zuniga plus a trio of decision victories over top-five ranked Tornado foes.\nKing would finally get on the board and narrow the gap to 14-8 after its pair of highly ranked middleweights earned 10-0 technical fall victories at 130 and 136 pounds (remember that nugget for later).\nHowever, if the proverbial ‘door’ had been opened even just a crack then the back half of Iowa’s lineup slammed it shut with authority.\nA 7-0 win at 143 pounds by #1 Reese Larramendy plus a forfeit victory at 155 pounds for top-ranked Marlynne Deede put the final nail in the coffin for the dual. Subsequent bonus point wins by #1 Kylie Welker at 170 (10-0 over #2 Tiffani Baublitz) and the aforementioned Foeller at 191 (fall over #6 Alexa Garcia) merely served to shovel dirt upon it.\nIowa 31, King 8.\nAll of that would set up the titanic finals matchup that everyone was hoping to see.\nIowa vs. North Central\nThis inaugural Hawkeye team truly is the ‘new kid on the block’ in the sport of women’s college wrestling, but they’ve also made their debut backed by a state and a school synonymous with wrestling greatness.\nThey entered Saturday afternoon ranked 1st in the latest NCAA coaches rankings but seeded second at National Duals.\nMeanwhile, top-seeded North Central entered as the reigning NCWWC national champs (the equivalent of the NCAA Tournament you’re familiar with on the Iowa men’s side of things) and hot on the Hawkeyes’ heels at #2 in the coaches’ poll.\nThe Cardinals are a private Division III school out of Naperville, Illinois that has risen to the top of the sport in relatively short order following the inception of its women’s program.\nSo, in a bizarre ‘narrative’ twist, both sides of the matchup could’ve conceivably painted themselves as either David or Goliath.\nOf course, a brief glance at the scoresheet from today’s dual would quickly dispel any such notion that either of these two were merely ‘slinging stones’ once they stepped onto the mat:\n101 – #2 Sterling Dias (IA) vs. #4 Maddie Avila (NC) – Dias W by tech. fall (11-0)\n4-0, Iowa\n109 – #2 Ava Bayless (IA) vs. ‘unranked’ Jaslynn Gallegos (NC) – Bayless W by dec. (5-5)\n7-1, Iowa\n116 – #3 Brianna Gonzalez (IA) vs. #2 Sydney Petzinger (NC) – Petzinger W by dec. (6-4)\n8-4, Iowa\n123 – #2 Felicity Taylor (IA) vs. #1 Amani Jones (NC) – Jones W by dec. (12-3)\n9-7, Iowa\n130 – #10 Emily Frost (IA) vs. #6 Salome Walker (NC) – Walker W by dec. (8-2)\n10-10, tied\n136 – unranked Lilly Luft (IA) vs. #1 Yele Aycock (NC) – Aycock W by dec. (6-2)\n11-13, North Central\n143 – #1 Reese Larramendy (IA) vs. ‘unranked’ Alara Boyd (NC) – Boyd W by dec. (9-4)\n12-16, North Central\n155 – #1 Marlynne Deede (IA) vs. #4 London Houston (NC) – Deede W by fall (1:38)\n17-16, Iowa\n170 – #1 Kylie Welker (IA) vs. ‘unranked’ Yelena Makoyed (NC) – Welker W by dec. (11-3)\n20-17, Iowa\n191 – ‘unranked’ Jaycee Foeller (IA) vs. #2 Traeh Haynes (NC) – Haynes W by dec. (6-1)\nIowa 21, North Central 20\nFor even greater context on the overwhelming amount of talent on the mat today for both teams enjoy these tidbits:\n- Each member of the North Central trio carrying with them an ‘unranked’ designation into Saturday’s final (at 109, 143 and 170 pounds) also happens to be a former national champion. All three were late roster additions entering the New Year after electing to utilize an extra fifth year of eligibility. Yelena Makoyed (170 pounds) is the three-time defending NCWWC champ.\n- As mentioned previously, Iowa’s ‘unranked’ Foeller is a two-time national finalist herself.\n- Between the two teams there were three current top-ranked athletes (at 101, 109 and 191 pounds respectively) left out of today’s dual due to either injury or a coach’s decision.\n- The Hawkeyes were also without the services of their top two options at 136 pounds – #2 Nanea Estrella and #8 Esther Han.\nBut enough of the background factoids, let’s get into the action.\nTo start things off, Iowa couldn’t realistically have asked for much more than the tech. fall it got from #2 Sterling Dias at 101 pounds followed by a last-second come-from-behind win by #2 Ava Bayless over the defending NCWWC 116-pound national champion.\nThe redshirt freshman Bayless trailed 5-0 with under 1:50 left, and 5-2 with barely 30 seconds on the clock before securing a takedown plus an additional penalty point as Gallegos (North Central) fled the mat amidst the sequence to avoid giving up additional exposure points. That made the match 5-5 in the Hawkeye’s favor on criteria, and she was able to stymie a few last-ditch efforts from her opponent to get the win.\nMomentum would stall, however, as previously undefeated Brianna Gonzalez (116) and Felicity Taylor (123) – both bumping up from their ideal weights this season – fell by decision to top-tier opponents.\nThe slide would continue at 130 and 136 as the only true freshmen in Iowa’s lineup – Emily Frost and Lilly Luft – dropped their matches by 8-2 and 6-2 scores respectively (more on the importance of that later). And it would conclude with a fifth consecutive defeat for the Hawkeyes, this one at 143 pounds (9-4) as #1 Reese Larramendy couldn’t climb out of an early hole against former national champ Alara Boyd.\nNow trailing by four, Iowa was in search of a spark to turn things back in its favor.\nIt would find just that at 155 pounds with Marlynne Deede.\nThe Augsburg University graduate transfer (and defending NCWWC champ) gave up a counter takedown for the match’s opening score, but responded with one of her own, dumping her opponent to her hip for two points and then eventually working to secure the fall to put her team back in front by one.\nMeanwhile, 170 pounds would feature the marquee bout of the dual, as Iowa’s RS freshman Kylie Welker took on North Central fifth-year senior Yelena Makoyed in a battle of two of best wrestlers at their weight not only in America, but worldwide. In this meeting it was Welker who would control the majority of the action on her way to an 11-3 decision.\nNow holding a 20-17 lead entering the 10th and final weight Iowa had two paths to winning the dual.\nA Foeller victory would obviously cinch things, but so too would a loss via decision…so long as Foeller scored at least one point of her own during the match. A loss by tech. fall or pin would swing the dual in North Central’s favor, as would a shutout defeat by regular decision (anything from 1-0 to 9-0).\nIt took her a while, but Foeller would finally get on the board courtesy of a second period passivity point and ultimately win the dual for the Hawkeyes (21-20) despite losing her own match 6-1.\nA wild conclusion befitting an equally wild dual if ever there was one.\nIowa brought home the National Duals crown despite only winning 4/10 matches. How?\nFirst, by notching two bonus points victories (one pin and one tech. fall). Second, by not ceding any bonus points to North Central. And third and perhaps most crucially, by scoring points, win or lose.\nYes, ‘scoring points’ helped to win a wrestling dual. Shocker, right?\nWell for those unfamiliar with freestyle team scoring in a dual meet setting it truly is more important than you may realize.\nWithin this criteria Iowa tallied 15 points courtesy of its four wins and an additional six via its six losses – good for 3.75 team points/win and 1.0 points/loss.\nMeanwhile, North Central racked up 18 points via six wins and another two across four defeats – that’s 3.0 team points/win and 0.5 points/loss.\nSimply put, the Hawkeyes got more bang for their buck in both victory and defeat, and it ultimately won them a national title.\nTrue freshmen like Frost and Luft who had both taken 10-0 drubbings earlier in the semi-finals came back just a few hours later against another pair of equally high-powered opponents and not only prevented bonus points but got on the scoreboard themselves – a four-point swing from their previous results.\nThose were the sorts of unsung moments that made this championship result achievable, and they were at the heart of the message that head coach Clarissa Chun had for her team post-match.\nOf course, this is hardly the end for these two teams and their battle for national supremacy.\nWith 10 individual titles (plus another team championship) to be contested at NCWWC’s in early March there’s still plenty left out there to accomplish – especially for these first-year Hawkeyes.\nThat said, it sure seems like a sign of great things to come that they’ve already proven themselves capable of beating the very best that women’s college wrestling has to offer despite being just three months into the program’s first official season on the mat.",

    "text": "Lebanon said Thursday that the death toll from Israeli assaults across the country hit 1,540 since last October. The Disaster Risk Management Unit said in a report the number injured stands at 5,410 and \"the number of displaced individuals registered in approved shelters had risen to 77,100 by Wednesday afternoon.\" The report said shelters in public facilities have increased to 565, including public schools, educational complexes, vocational institutes and agricultural centers. It noted that thousands more have traveled by air or crossed Lebanese territory to Syria, and the agency estimated that the actual number far exceeds the official count. The statement indicated that during the last two days, the General Security registered the passage of 15,600 Syrian nationals and 16,130 Lebanese citizens into Syrian territory. Regarding Israeli assaults, the report stated that since Monday, there had been 7,034 airstrikes or bombings, 248 phosphorus bombings and 133 instances of gunfire. Israel has pounded Lebanon since early Monday in strikes that have killed at least 677 victims and injured more than 2,500, according to figures released by the Health Ministry. The Lebanese resistance group, Hezbollah, and Israel have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the start of Israel's onslaught against Gaza, which has killed more than 41,500 victims, mostly women and children, following a cross-border attack by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas, last Oct. 7. The international community has warned against the strikes on Lebanon, as they raise the specter of spreading the Gaza conflict regionally.",

    "title": "EV charging vandalism could undermine Washington state's environmental goals",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – Washington state aims to have fast-charging electric vehicle ports every 50 miles across the entire span of its 2,633-mile road system, and 3 million total in both public and private charging ports. However, these efforts to electrify the state's transportation sector could be undermined by copper wire thefts that have already hit newly-installed charging stations in various locations, leaving the chargers unusable and costing taxpayers. It’s a problem already noted by the Washington State Department of Transportation. According to the state agency, total wire theft on their properties has cost taxpayers $1.5 million since 2021. “Drivers and taxpayers are the ones being ultimately harmed by these crimes,” a WSDOT webpage states. “Unlike private companies or members of the public who may be insured by commercial insurance companies, WSDOT is self-insured. Since there is no insurance company with which to file a claim, WSDOT losses are paid by taxpayers.” Metal thefts isn’t a recent phenomenon. It was a big enough problem in 2007 for the Legislature to enact Senate Bill 5312 , which increased penalties for those found guilty of stealing metals. In a May 2023 WSDOT blog post, Sean Quin, social media lead for WSDOT's Northwest Region, wrote that the agency is facing thefts like this on a daily basis. “Not only is this theft costly to taxpayers, it also puts people at risk who have to make those repairs and the public loses critical infrastructure that helps traffic flow smoothly,\" he wrote. \"Despite the effort put forth by us and law enforcement, it’s no guarantee that our equipment will be protected from further damage or theft. Copper wire thieves have also hit other public entities, including Seattle City Lights, which between March 2023-January 2024 had eight of its 13 stations subject to theft. Puget Sound Energy has also experienced thefts. In March, a newly-unveiled $500,000 EV charging station in Sumner had wires stolen, making them unusable for EV drivers. While the direct cost to taxpayers via WSDOT for metal thefts may not seem high, the thefts can cost the state in multiple ways. WSDOT also experiences metal thefts with its tolling operations, which cost them $440,000 in lost revenue annually. Additionally, the repairs every year are around $96,000. In five counties, WSDOT has invested $310,000 in security upgrades in the last biennium. Although the 2007 state law upped the penalties for metal thieves, it’s still classified as “other” among crimes deemed “destruction/damage/vandalism offenses” in annual crime reports compiled by the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. However, as drivers transition more and more toward EVs and the state 2030 mandate banning sale of new fossil fuel vehicles takes effect, thefts of EV charging ports could have much greater implications for transportation infrastructure. WSDOT says “it can often take several days if not weeks to make repairs to the infrastructure and replace the wiring due to delays in materials or availability of crews to go out and complete the work.” While WSDOT says WSP “aggressively investigates these crimes as they risk public safety by disabling traffic signals and other devices,” WSP Captain Deion Glover wrote in an email to The Center Square that “many of these events occur in city or county areas, and the WSP does not track those crime rates.” He added that although “WSP is always looking to reduce crime in all areas of the community … we do not have a specific plan to address copper wire theft at this specific time frame.” The Center Square reached out to the state Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council’s co-chairs, but both were unavailable for comment.",

    "title": "Oldest inhabited termite mounds have been active for 34,000 years",
    "text": "Scientists in South Africa have been stunned to discover that termite mounds that are still inhabited in an arid region of the country are more than 30,000 years old, meaning they are the oldest known active termite hills. Some of the mounds near the Buffels River in Namaqualand were estimated by radiocarbon dating to be 34,000 years old, according to the researchers from Stellenbosch University. Michele Francis, senior lecturer in the university’s department of soil science who led the study, said: “We knew they were old, but not that old.” Her paper was published in May. Ms Francis said the mounds existed while sabre-toothed cats and woolly mammoths roamed other parts of the Earth and large swathes of Europe and Asia were covered in ice. They predate some of the earliest cave paintings in Europe. The mounds are older than the earliest recorded cave paintings (Alamy/PA) Some fossilised termite mounds have been discovered dating back millions of years. The oldest inhabited mounds before this study were found in Brazil and are around 4,000 years old. They are visible from space. Ms Francis said the Namaqualand mounds are a termite version of an “apartment complex” and the evidence shows they have been consistently inhabited by termite colonies. Termite mounds are a famous feature of the Namaqualand landscape, but no-one suspected their age until samples of them were taken to experts in Hungary for radiocarbon dating. “People don’t know that these are special, ancient landscapes that are preserved there,” Ms Francis said. Some of the biggest mounds – known locally as “heuweltjies”, which means little hills in the Afrikaans language – measure around 100ft (30 metres) across. The termite nests are as deep as 10ft underground. Researchers needed to carefully excavate parts of the mounds to take samples, and the termites went into “emergency mode” and started filling in the holes, Ms Francis said. Termite mounds can benefit the local plant life (Alamy/PA) The team fully reconstructed the mounds to keep the termites safe from predators like aardvarks. Ms Francis said the project was more than just a fascinating look at ancient structures. It also offered a peek into a prehistoric climate that showed Namaqualand was a much wetter place when the mounds were formed. The southern harvester termites are experts at capturing and storing carbon by collecting twigs and other dead wood and putting it back deep into the soil. That has benefits in offsetting climate change by reducing the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere. It is also good for the soil. Masses of wildflowers bloom on top of the termite mounds in a region that receives little rain. Ms Francis called for more research on termite mounds given the lessons they offer on climate change, sustaining ecosystems and maybe even for improving agricultural practices. “We will do well to study what the termites have done in the mounds. They were thought to be very boring,” she said.",
