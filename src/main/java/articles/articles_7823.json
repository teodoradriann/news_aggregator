    "text": "The Oldest Complete Book of Psalms is Back on Display\nOne of the most treasured artifacts in the collections of the Coptic Museum in Cairo, the so-called Pillow Psalter, is back on display. Dating to about 400 CE, this oldest complete Coptic manuscript of the Book of Psalms returned to public view in February, following almost five years of restoration work. As reported by several Egyptian outlets, including the\nState Information Service, the ancient codex has been fully restored and documented and is now presented in a newly designed permanent exhibit, ready to awe and inspire many more generations of visitors to the Coptic Museum.\nThe psalter owes its nickname to the unusual circumstances of its discovery. In 1984, the codex was excavated by antiquities inspectors from a humble Christian grave at al-Mudil, an Egyptian village some 25 miles northeast of al-Bahnasa (ancient Oxyrhynchus, known for its\npapyri). It was found open and placed as a pillow beneath the head of an adolescent girl. It was the only object buried with the girl and one of immense value. The purpose of such arrangement is unclear, but it brings to mind the ancient Egyptian practice of burying the Book of the Dead with the deceased to aid their passage into the afterlife. The girl’s family must have loved her exceedingly to send her off with such a precious object; they may have believed the holy book would aid her chances of resurrection. The psalter is more commonly known as the Mudil Codex, having been discovered at al-Mudil. It has since found its way to the Coptic Museum in Cairo, where it was first displayed in 1992 and given catalogue number 6614.\nDespite favorable environmental conditions, which preserved the parchment codex for more than one and a half millennia, the manuscript was in desperate need of professional treatment. Over the past five years, a team of Egyptian conservators from the Coptic Museum and the Museum of Islamic Art worked to address various forms of damage that had resulted from ancient usage, contact with the corpse, and dry climate. The whole book had to be dismantled to allow for thorough treatment of individual pages and the binding. Throughout this process, the Mudil Codex was documented using ultraviolet and infrared digital photography. Upon completion of the restoration work, it was finally sewed together and given a prominent place in the museum.\nThe Mudil Psalter is significant not only because it is the oldest surviving complete translation of the Book of Psalms in Coptic. Its text differs from other contemporary or later Coptic translations of the Septuagint psalms, thus adding to the history of text transmission. The two major questions are (1) what the model texts for this translation were (i.e., to which text family it might belong), and (2) in what ways it was revised. In fact, it contains some linguistically difficult passages and curious readings. It is also important to consider that, unlike so many manuscript finds (including much of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the “Gnostic library” from\nNag Hammadi), this codex comes from a controlled excavation.\nUnfortunately, the only book-length study of the manuscript appeared recently\nin German. Meticulous and highly technical, this monograph is written only for the selected few who read German and the relevant original languages (Hebrew, Greek, and Coptic), which are quoted without accompanying translations. Luckily, an accessible summary is available in the form of an English book review.\nCleaned and restored, the Mudil Codex is now back on view, in a special permanent exhibit at the Coptic Museum—the Book of Psalms Hall. This museum space includes interactive screens for visitors to engage with the artifact. Also available are digital photographs of the entire manuscript, label text in seven languages, and an audio guide. For their accomplishment, the restoration team won the Dr. Zahi Hawass Award for the best restoration project in 2023.\nThe world of the Bible is knowable.

    "text": "莆田市涵江区：一加一减，重塑“海上森林”\n2025-03-13 09:32:26 来源：东南网 责任编辑：周冬\n|\n东南网3月13日报道（福建日报报业集团记者 陈汉儿） 春和景明万物长。在位于莆田市涵江区三江口镇的木兰溪入海口流域，一望无际的滩涂上红树林绵延成片、迎风摇曳。 海岸带蓝碳是地球上最密集的碳汇之一，其中最为重要的当数红树林。2023年起，涵江区人民法院、检察院、公安分局等单位，在“全国最美家乡河”木兰溪入海口设置“木兰溪口湿地红树林保护区”，开展以蓝碳增汇模式进行的替代性修复，以“生态+执行”模式不断织密“海上森林”，优化木兰溪流域生态司法保护。 执行环节做加法 蓝碳增汇添保障 沿着蜿蜒泥泞的小道行走，一幅生机勃勃的“海上森林”画卷随之铺展开来。其间，300平方米新种植的红树林冒着新绿，倔强地挺立着。 这片“五月龄”的红树林幼苗，是去年涵江区人民法院一起休渔期非法捕捞案件当事人，以“造林增汇”蓝碳替代性修复补植的。 促淤保滩、防风消浪、降解污染、调节气候……红树林素有“海洋绿肺”“海岸卫士”的美誉，是生物多样性最丰富的生态系统之一。去年起，针对部分无法进行原地生态修复的生态环境资源破坏类案件，涵江区人民法院引导当事人通过专业第三方，在“木兰溪口湿地红树林保护区”补植红树，以“造林增汇”蓝碳替代性修复方式履行生态环境修复义务。 实际上，从种苗培育到造林管护，红树林种植修复是一个系统性工程。如何种植？能否成功？后续如何管理？ 资料显示，红树林生长的海岸环境风浪大，土壤泥泞松软且厌氧，为了适应环境，红树衍生出了特殊的海绵组织结构根系，但这样的结构在受伤后难以产生愈伤组织，加上海水盐度高、病虫害侵入等，导致红树林在人工定植修复中的成活率通常偏低。 “生态补偿，不是‘一种了之’。”涵江区人民法院生态环境审判庭庭长蔡林莉告诉记者，从种植到验收，生态资源环境案件办理普遍存在着生态司法技术要求高、生态修复难度大、修复执行监督缺失等难点。 为了让每批红树林幼苗能在泥泞中“站稳脚跟”，涵江区人民法院在全省率先在生态环境资源案件的执行程序中引入“生态技术调查官”制度，由农林领域专家介入执行环节，协助第三方企业为涉生态环境鉴定、评估、修复等提供专业指导，填补执行法官在生态技术领域的“知识盲区”。 调查取样、分析论证、制定方案……作为涵江区人民法院聘用的“生态技术调查官”，莆田市农业农村局正高级农艺师原瑞芬一上任就忙了起来，她全程协助参与案件审理，对案件造成的环境损害程度、可行性生态修复方案等给出专业意见，并对后续执行展开监督。 “‘司法蓝碳’已经不是一个新概念了。”蔡林莉表示，涵江的特色是在执行环节做加法，引入“生态技术调查官”，通过涉生态司法领域的技术赋能，发力案件后半程，为生态系统保护加码。 探索“减量”新模式 生态修复增质效 2024年夏季，三江口镇的两名村民在伏季休渔期间，先后两次到兴化湾海域使用违禁的电鱼设备捕鱼，以此出售获利。当年12月初，这起非法捕捞水产品案件进入审判阶段，但时值冬季，并不是补种植绿、替代修复的适宜季节。 “我们在保护区选用的红树林苗是秋茄品种，系Ⅰ级苗。秋茄适宜生长的温度为20~30℃，最佳生长温度为25℃左右，它不耐寒，温度低于15℃时，生长速度较为缓慢，也不适合大量种植。”原瑞芬告诉记者。 为探索更丰富的海洋环境修复路径，生态法官组织相关部门、专业第三方共赴保护区现场商谈。众人注意到，正值互花米草大范围萌发的时节，借助无人机视角，大家发现整个入海口沿岸滩涂都有互花米草的入侵痕迹，且有愈演愈烈之势。 实际上，除了寒冬，红树林在自然界还有一个“劲敌”——互花米草。作为全球危害最大的外来入侵物种之一，互花米草凭借其根系发达、繁殖力强、种群扩散快等特性，不断挤压红树等原生植物的生长空间及可获取的营养成分。此外，互花米草生命力强、复萌率高，除治方式、管护工序均需要专门力量完成。 几经考量，大家一致决定将案件的生态修复费用用于除治互花米草，以外来入侵植物防治的“减量型”生态司法修复模式，反向推进生态修复。 临海滩涂边，一人高的草丛圈着一片龟裂结块的土地。七八名工人头戴斗笠，拎着镰刀、锄头等工具，以人工刈割法、深翻法、挖拔除法，清理了木兰溪沿岸滩涂约10亩的互花米草。翻整后的土地露出原有面貌，散发阵阵春泥气息，再过一个月，这里将成为红树林的新家园。 “与通常的补植复绿、碳汇认购等蓝碳‘增量’方式替代性生态环境修复模式不同，我们开创性地将生态修复目标对准保护区内互花米草的除治和管护，通过‘减量’修复反向推进蓝碳保护，促进海洋生态服务功能提升。”蔡林莉说，涵江区人民法院的这一保护新模式被最高人民法院予以推广。 “人民法院环境资源审判作为生态环境法治工作的重要组成部分，既要依法惩治环境资源犯罪，又要积极引导被告人修复受损生态环境，让破坏者成为守护者。”涵江区人民法院党组成员、刑事审判庭庭长姚丹表示，将继续秉持生态恢复性司法理念，探索碳汇多元修复方式，以司法实践助力天更蓝、地更绿、水更清、山河更多彩。 |\n相关阅读:\n|\n|\n闽ICP备05022042号) 互联网新闻信息服务许可证 编号：35120170001 网络文化经营许可证 闽网文〔2019〕3630-217号\n信息网络传播视听节目许可（互联网视听节目服务/移动互联网视听节目服务）证号：1310572 广播电视节目制作经营许可证（闽）字第085号\n网络出版服务许可证 （署）网出证（闽）字第018号 增值电信业务经营许可证 闽B2-20100029 互联网药品信息服务（闽）-经营性-2015-0001\n福建日报报业集团拥有东南网采编人员所创作作品之版权，未经报业集团书面授权，不得转载、摘编或以其他方式使用和传播\n职业道德监督、违法和不良信息举报电话：0591-87095403（工作日9:00-12:00、15:00-18:00） 举报邮箱：jubao@fjsen.com 福建省新闻道德委举报电话：0591-87275327",

    "title": "Virgin Galactic Unveils Next-Gen Spaceplane-Here's When It Will Fly",
    "text": "Virgin Galactic is gearing up for a major step forward in its goal to make space tourism a reality with the upcoming construction of its first Delta SpaceShip. This next-generation suborbital spaceplane is set to begin assembly in March 2025 at a new facility located near Phoenix, Arizona. This move is a crucial part of the company’s plan to start commercial flights by mid-2026.\nThe timeline for getting the Delta SpaceShip ready for commercial operations is ambitious but appears to be within reach. Assembly starting in March 2025 will lead to test flights in the spring of 2026. These test flights are expected to be more efficient than those conducted with the company’s previous spacecraft, VSS Unity, because they will use the extensive flight data collected from Unity to make comparisons and streamline the testing process.\nCommercial flights are planned to begin in mid-2026, initially focusing on carrying research payloads. These research flights, which are expected to number between six and ten, will serve two purposes: advancing scientific research and providing additional operational testing before the company starts flying private astronauts in the fall of 2026.\nOnce private astronaut flights begin, Virgin Galactic plans to quickly ramp up the number of flights, aiming to reach a rate of two flights per week. The company hopes to achieve this increased flight frequency by early 2027 at the latest. This aggressive schedule is a key part of Virgin Galactic’s strategy to become profitable.\nThe Delta SpaceShip is not just a minor upgrade from its predecessor, VSS Unity; it represents a major technological advancement. While it builds on the successful design of Unity, the Delta benefits from the knowledge and data gathered during Unity’s operational life. This allows the testing phase for Delta to be more focused and efficient, as the company can concentrate on confirming Delta’s performance against established benchmarks rather than making gradual improvements.\nRelated: China Poised To Benefit As U.S. Space Industry Prepares To Lose Money In Trump’s Trade Policies\nVirgin Galactic’s financial future is closely tied to the success of the Delta SpaceShip program. In 2024, the company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $288.5 million, which is an improvement over the $427 million loss in 2023.\nThe company has $657 million in cash and equivalents, which should be enough to fund the completion of the Delta SpaceShip program. The shift to regular commercial flights is essential for the company to achieve positive EBITDA and long-term financial stability.\nIn addition to space tourism, Virgin Galactic is looking into other opportunities to expand its business. The company’s unique “mothership” aircraft, VMS Eve, which can carry heavy payloads to altitudes of 15,000 meters, is a valuable asset.\nVirgin Galactic is exploring the possibility of creating new versions of VMS Eve for high-altitude, long-endurance missions, with a focus on securing government and research contracts in areas like intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This initiative is still in the early stages of design but could open up new opportunities for the company to grow its operations and revenue.\nLearn more about our Affiliate Policy",

    "title": "Nigerian airports shut out PWDs, decaying terminals worsen passengers trauma",
    "text": "People living with disabilities have been complaining about the lack of facilities to meet their special needs at airports across the country. This happens as business and leisure travellers groan over decaying airport facilities, JUSTICE OKAMGBA reports About one billion people living with disabilities are estimated to be travelling by air globally, according to the International Air Transport Association. For many of them, the travel experience is a nightmare as most airports have no provision for their special needs. In Nigeria, airports were constructed without facilities such as consumer desks, special toilet facilities, and flight display systems specifically designed for people with disabilities. PWDs have described the lack of provision of special facilities for them as discrimination against them. The challenges of accessing onboard toilets and managing special accommodation requests have continued to create a challenging environment for travellers with disabilities. While Nigerian airports often provide wheelchairs, some international airports have gone further to implement technology solutions and smartphone applications to assist people with low vision. Airports like Boise Airport in the USA and Vancouver International Airport in Canada have introduced virtual reality training, specifically designed for autistic passengers. Experts said such an innovative approach helped individuals with disabilities familiarise themselves with the airport environment, ultimately reducing stress during travel. The PUNCH reported that people with disabilities find Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos more stressful than Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, which are the two busiest airports in Nigeria. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority acknowledged the need for better airports and the challenges hindering progress, including inadequate finance, insufficient infrastructure, and security risks. The Federal Government has budgeted N23.1bn for the “rehabilitation and repairs” of airport facilities across the country in the 2024 fiscal year. N21.0bn has been earmarked for the rehabilitation and repairs of airports and aerodromes, with an additional N2.1bn allocated for the rehabilitation of air navigational equipment. Our correspondent cannot independently verify if these proposed rehabilitations and repairs will cater to the needs of passengers with disabilities. PWDs’ experiences A cripple and PWD advocate, Waheed Oguntade, told our correspondent that most of the country’s airports are disability-friendliness. Oguntade, who disclosed that he frequented airports like Akwa Ibom, Lagos (both local and international), Abuja, and Enugu airports, said, “I still find the Lagos airport the most disability-friendly compared to even the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja. This is what I will attribute to the level of awareness and interaction with the international community.” He urged airlines to capture PWD data during flight bookings as that would enable operators to make informed decisions and enhance airport services. “If the data of PWDs are captured during booking, this will enable airlines to make provision for the PWDs, instead of just improvising on the spot. This information will also determine the type of plane to put PWDs based on their disabilities.” According to Oguntade, the public address system is not audible enough for people with auditory impairments, especially those travelling alone. “There is a need to have an information board close to the departure gate for those with total hearing loss,” he suggested. The PWDs advocate asked the government to establish designated parking lots close to departure halls for people physically challenged persons in all airports in the country. He claimed that this would facilitate easy movement for PWDs in the airports A member of the Coalition of Disability Organisations, Susan Ihuoma, told The PUNCH that physical barriers such as stairs, narrow corridors and a lack of ramps posed challenges for individuals with mobility impairments, hindering their independent navigation through the airport. “Restrooms, seating areas, and other facilities may not be designed to accommodate various disabilities, affecting their comfort and convenience,” she stated. Ihuoma noted that individuals with certain disabilities encountered challenges with airport security measures. “For example, those with mobility issues face challenges during body scans or when they are asked to remove shoes and other items.” According to Ihuoma, many airport workers lack adequate training in communicating with individuals who are deaf or dumb. “Airport personnel are not fully aware of the specific needs of persons with disabilities, leading to a lack of appropriate assistance and support. “Access to real-time flight information, gate changes, or boarding announcements pose challenges for individuals who are blind or deaf, particularly when the information is not provided in accessible formats,” she remarked. She added some PWDs had challenges with navigating from one terminal to another or accessing transportation options like shuttles or taxis due to a lack of accessible transportation services. PWDs’ experiences in foreign airports The challenges PWDs face in airports are not limited to Nigeria. Some foreign PWDs also shared their stories. The story of Craig Nolan, who has a spinal cord defect and uses a wheelchair, suffered discrimination at the hands of airline workers staff in Melbourne, Australia informed him that he couldn’t travel alone, was published in the UK Guardian. Nolan, intending to return home to Finland, was told by airline staff that he could not travel alone as a disabled person. Despite his plans and preparations, he was taken off the flight in the middle of the night, leaving him stranded without a clear solution. After he was ejected from the plane, Nolan had nowhere to go. After negotiations with the airline, he was given an accommodation. The incident involving Nolan was one of the evidence presented to the Disability Royal Commission, revealing systemic challenges faced by Australians with disabilities in air travel. A quadriplegic passenger, Victoria Brignell, shared how her experience when she left on a plane for over an hour and a half upon landing at Gatwick Airport, London. Brignell, who had pre-booked assistance three months in advance, said she had to wait for a long time because the assistance she required to disembark the plane did not arrive as scheduled. Despite reminders two weeks before her journey, the service was not provided promptly. “I can’t use my arms or legs. To get off a plane I need two people to lift me from the airplane seat into an aisle chair, which is a specially-designed narrow wheelchair to push me along the aisle off the plane and lift me into my wheelchair waiting outside,” Brignell. She criticised Gatwick Airport for failing to provide the necessary support, adding that the delay not only affected her but also inconvenienced other passengers awaiting their flights. “I have been very nervous about travelling by plane because I had heard so many horrible stories about people’s chairs going missing,” he disclosed. Brignell said British Airways staffers got her off the plane and she received an apology from Gatwick via Twitter, but she planned to submit an official complaint. “As a disabled person, I now expect to be treated poorly in airports. I have experienced inaccessible air travel many times,” Celestine Fraser wrote in a column on Metro UK, published on Oct 17, 2021. According to Fraser, her first ugly experience at the airport was when she and her family travelled to Morocco. She disclosed that dropped out of the university, because of a series of health problems. “Looking back, I can’t help but see it as my rude awakening into life as a disabled person — disabled not by my body, but by barriers in society,” the 18-year-old noted. Fraser said that on arrival at the airport, her brothers suggested that she sat on the luggage trolley like it was a makeshift wheelchair, wheeling her through the airport to the special assistance desk, where she was given a real wheelchair, pushed through security, and given priority to board the plane. “So far smooth enough. It was when we landed that I faced my second barrier; this one attitudinal. I was met by a special assistance attendant who wore a permanent smirk and kept asking me why I needed the wheelchair,” she narrated. According to Fraser, at the time, he hadn’t had any diagnosis yet, and she struggled to give a perfect answer to the airport attendant. She explained, “I told him simply that ‘I had an illness that makes it hard for me to walk’, to which he replied that I was ‘too young’ and looked ‘too well’ to need a wheelchair. I felt ashamed, like I was somehow guilty, and I worried that maybe I would never be believed, because my illness was invisible. “The attendant wheeled me reluctantly through security. Then suddenly, without a word he disappeared, leaving me in the corner of the airport, my wheelchair facing a wall. The experience was humiliating. “When my family eventually found me – as they had to go through separately – they were shocked, but we were still all new to the lived reality of being disabled. We brushed this off as a singular bad experience and didn’t complain.” Fraser believed disabled people don’t have to disclose the intimate details of their medical conditions just to get the basic access that they deserve. Fraser also shared another ugly experience at the airport in 2018, this time in her home country, Italy. She disclosed that she was in return flight from Madeira, Portugal, when flight attendants announced that all passengers requiring special assistance would be driven to passport control in a separate buggy. “All the PWD were isolated from their friends and families but assured that they would soon be reunited. “After a long wait on the plane, they were made to board a small van and were driven to a room just off the tarmac. “An attendant told us that someone would come and pick us up; then she left, locking the doors behind her. The only exit was a towering staircase, which clearly, none of us could climb,” Fraser enunciated. According to her, they had to wait, “I phoned my family and they tried to find me, but none of us could work out what room I was in, and the airport staff were no help in trying to reunite us”. Fraser said they were there for almost two hours before they were picked up, adding that some of them missed their connecting flights. She noted, “Once we got home, we complained — but the short apologetic email did little to alleviate the harm that was caused.” The airport blamed the airline and the airline blamed the airport. There was no explanation, and certainly no compensation. “But these experiences are not mine alone. They happen to disabled travellers all the time,” Fraser wrote. People like Fraser are requesting for the right things to be done at the various airports in the globe for PWD. She concluded, “Because disabled people are not asking for seats in business class or complimentary champagne. “What we want is simple: To safely board a plane. Order an overpriced Bloody Mary. Get tipsy with the altitude. Empty our bladders. And land on the ground with our wheelchairs – and our dignity – intact. That doesn’t sound like special assistance. It sounds like a human right.” The PUNCH contacted Fraser but she declined to provide more details. However, Fraser responded, I’m afraid I won’t be able to help you with this story as it has now been years since I have travelled abroad by plane. So, I don’t feel I can provide an honest and up-to-date insight into what air travel is currently like for disabled people.” Poor facilities PWDs are not the only ones concerned by the poor state of transportation facilities in Nigerian airports. Chijioke Ejemba, a frequent air traveller, expressed worry about the deteriorating state of transportation facilities at Murtala Muhammed International Airport. He complained about non-functional buses and malfunctioning toll gates, leading to severe passenger inconvenience. Ejemba pointed out that all buses designated to shuttle passengers between parking lots and the airport were out of service due to a lack of maintenance. “They were all bought brand new some years back. Passengers have to trek miles to move from the parking lot to airport and vice versa. “I was unfortunate enough to have been at the airport recently and I ended up with severe back pain due to the trekking and load I tagged along,” Ejemba said. Another passenger, Raphael Falola decried the unprofessional conduct of customs officers at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, emphasising the stark contrast between the entry processes for Nigerians and non-Nigerians. “It is so sad that in Nigeria the process of entry is easier for foreigners than Nigerians! We talk about the ease of doing business, display SERVICOM banners at the airport and say nice things but we are wicked to ourselves,” he noted. Despite global advancements in electronic and efficient services, he lamented that the officials still expect gratification. This, according to Falola, contributed to a nearly two-hour wait in the passport queue after his 8 pm scheduled landing. “What is the KPI for these officials? What do they really understand by service delivery? Do they realise that their conduct is enough to put sand in the mouth of any visitor?” he queried. Beyond customs issues, Falola criticised the management of the airport, describing his experience as “horrid.” He highlighted poorly lit exit tunnels, security risks posed by rogues and unfamiliar faces harassing travelers. He stressed the need to create a positive and secure experience for travellers, especially at the port of welcome for those entering Nigeria. Falola urged the airport management to take immediate action to address those issues, to enable the airport to be run more efficiently. Another foreign traveller identified as Diani Ski, recounted an experience at the Lagos airport, dubbing it “possibly the worst in the world. He complained about the lack of transit facilities, coupled with intimidating encounters with military-looking personnel. The traveller, en route to The Gambia, said he faced a daunting situation with only two hours before departure. “We asked the military-looking guy directing people to immigration controls that we were in transit and where we could pick our boarding passes for our en route flight. “He told us that we had to go through immigration. He was very intimidating and aggressive,” he narrated. Despite explaining the lack of visas and the urgency to catch their connecting flight, Ski said they were coerced into going through immigration, ultimately finding themselves in Nigeria illegally. He noted, “We were taken to the Air Nigeria departure section, where there was a passport controls check. One of the personnel told my partner, who has a British passport that he needed a visa to go to the Gambia. “Despite providing evidence to the contrary, Ski and her partner faced unnecessary complications. Luckily he had gone to the Gambia the previous month and his visa had not expired.” According to Ski, the security checks added to the distress, with an incident where money was openly solicited during a bag inspection. “As we boarded our flight, there was a security check where the lady checking my bags openly asked me to give her money. I managed to wangle my way out of it. I was extremely relieved to be on the plane,” he added. The traveller expressed relief upon boarding the flight, highlighting the oppressive heat and stuffiness within the airport. However, the nightmare extended with delayed baggage, which only arrived two days later. Despite the challenges, the bags remained intact, providing a surprising silver lining to an otherwise nightmarish experience, Ski added. Further, the traveller drew a sharp contrast upon arriving in The Gambia, where staff exhibited friendliness and warmth “Staff was nice and friendly. If you can avoid it, try to connect through a different country even if it takes longer. Our bags only arrived two days later! None of them had been broken into which I am surprised about,” Ski concluded. In a review on TripAdvisor, one of the largest travel websites, an Australian traveler simply identified as Jenny B recounted her experience at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, labelling it as the “very worst airport” she has ever encountered. Jenny expressed frustration over the absence of a proper transit system at the airport. “They have no transit; they take your passport off you and send you to get your bags without explanation. Then, I was left to sit for two hours; they would not give my passport back to me,” he stated. A staff member, Jenny described as rude and aggressive in military-style attire, guided her through a convoluted route involving multiple stairs and outside areas. Jenny said, “He (staff member) waited impatiently at the top while I struggled up the stairs with 2 suitcases weighing 20 kilos each and an 8 kilo backpack. It was so difficult and on the last lot of stairs a kind man helped me.” Due to the extended wait, Jenny faced a delayed check-in, with the flight eventually closing. After an argument, she was finally checked in five hours after the original departure time, only to be informed that the flight was cancelled. “They take the entire planeload of people to some dodgy dirty hotel that actually seems to be a house with personal items in it.” Jenny recounted her discomfort at the makeshift hotel, describing dirty beds and shared accommodations. She said the lack of basic amenities like toilet paper and ineffective air conditioning further contributed to her dismay. “On my way back through this airport, I was scared to death, but hey, they only lost one of my suitcases this time…..and believe it or not it actually did arrive in Australia two days later, “ the Australian said. Jenny described the airport as a “debacle,” highlighting the lack of a proper transit system, issues with cleanliness and amenities, and expressing concerns about the overall quality of service. PWD law The Discrimination Against People Living with Disabilities Provision Act signed by former President Muhammadu In 2019 is aimed at safeguarding the rights of individuals with disabilities by mitigating discrimination and fostering inclusion. Additionally, it mandates public buildings to undergo necessary adjustments to accommodate people with disabilities. The convener of the Coalition of Disability Organisations, David Anyele, urged airport authorities and airline operators to ensure inclusive travel experiences for people with disabilities. “We are worried that despite the passage of the Discrimination Against People Living with Disabilities Provision Act, PWDs still struggle to access airports. “Air travel is the most convenient means for long-distance trips for Nigerians, so PWDs patronise airport services regularly, “ he stated. In the past, persons with disabilities had submitted petitions outlining alleged violations of their rights. Those petitions led the House of Representatives in 2021 to issue a directive to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and other pertinent agencies, instructing them to establish operational disability desks at airports. However the implementation of this directive has not alleviated the plights of PWDs in the airports.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "NYC Council votes to expand 'advice-and-consent' oversight of mayoral hires over Adams objections Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) NEW YORK — The City Council voted by a wide margin Thursday to expand its ability to block top mayoral hires, teeing up another potential veto battle with Mayor Eric Adams, whose team has sharply criticized the move as a power grab that’d hamper municipal government operations. The hot-button issue relates to “advice-and-consent,” the process that requires the mayor to secure the Council’s approval before making hires for certain top city government posts. As it currently stands, only a handful commissioner-level posts, including the corporation counsel, need to undergo advice-and-consent. But a bill passed by the Council on Thursday — in a 46-4 vote — would add another 20 agency commissioners to the list of positions subjected to advice-and-consent. The posts that previously didn’t have to undergo advice-and-consent that would under the legislation include everything from the commissioners of Sanitation, Parks and Buildings to the heads of Social Services and Children’s Services. In a press conference before the vote, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who authored the bill, said it is about increasing government transparency, ensuring candidate quality and protecting against corruption. “It incentivizes the nomination of qualified appointees who are accountable to New Yorkers and the public interest, not political loyalty or patronage,” she told reporters. “Advice-and-consent is a safeguard against … a Tammany Hall-like environment, where commissioner positions are doled out simply because of their political allegiance to one person or another.” The speaker’s reference to Tammany Hall, the infamously corrupt organization that controlled New York politics in the 19th century, comes after the mayor and his advisers made the case in a press conference Tuesday that it’s actually the Council’s advice-and-consent expansion that would foster a Tammany-like process around commissioner appointments. In the news conference, Lisa Zornberg, the mayor’s chief counsel, said that’s because the “deeply misguided” bill would tie the mayor’s hands from staffing city agencies and politicize the appointment process by requiring consent from a majority of the Council’s 51 members. The mayor hasn’t said whether he’ll veto the bill. Spokespeople for him did not immediately return requests for comment after Thursday’s vote in the Council. Since taking office in January 2022, the mayor has used his veto pen several times, though, including in trying to block bills passed by the Council expanding housing voucher access, banning solitary confinement in city jails and implementing more rigorous reporting requirements on NYPD officers. In each of those instances, the Council responded by overriding the mayor’s vetoes, forcing the bills into laws over his objections. At the pre-vote press conference, the speaker said her Democratic Council majority is ready to override the mayor again on the advice-and-consent issue should he pick the veto route. “In the unfortunate circumstance that it is vetoed, the Council will proceed as we normally have with past vetoes with this administration,” she said. The veto issue aside, if the speaker’s bill ends up going into law, the advice-and-consent expansion cannot be officially implemented before New York City residents vote on the matter via a ballot referendum. The question has to be approved via referendum because it involves amending the City Charter, the local constitution. Council Democrats have said they’re aiming to get the advice-and-consent question onto this November’s general election ballot, though that may be preempted by a separate charter revision effort initiated by the mayor.",
