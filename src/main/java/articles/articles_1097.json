Una sfida molto ambiziosa e difficile da realizzare, quella che Bologna, assieme ad altre 99 città europee, si è data all’interno di un progetto pilota finanziato dall’Unione europea, la Missione \"100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030\". Non è però solo una dichiarazione di intenti. Al contrario, le 100 città, di cui 9 italiane, hanno redatto un vero e proprio contratto climatico (il climate city contract) sottoposto alla Commissione Europea nel 2024, che raccoglie azioni, strategie e linee applicative, con indicatori e investimenti previsti. Obiettivo è la riduzione delle emissioni tale da azzerare il bilancio tra CO2 emessa e assorbita in città.\nCaricamento in corso: attendi un istante...\nSi è verificato un errore: prova ad aggiornare il tuo browser.\nProva ad aggiornare questa pagina|\nGestisci il tuo abbonamento\nGestisci il tuo abbonamento\nGestisci il tuo abbonamento",

    "text": "[CRN](https://robbreport.com/tag/crn/)’s [superyacht](https://robbreport.com/tag/superyacht/) [Comfortably Numb](https://www.crn-yacht.com/en-us/News-and-events/Detail/t/MY-Comfortably-Numb-is-the-perfect-blend-of/n/2289) has a lot in common with Pink Floyd’s 1979 hit: It’s epic, powerful, and totally unique. The bespoke 197-footer was actually delivered in December 2022, but the Italian yard released all the juicy details regarding the build on Wednesday. Comfortably Numb was designed by the Italian architects at Nuvolari Lenard and handcrafted by the team at CRN’s superyacht yard in Ancona, Italy. As such, the vessel showcases true made in Italy flair and finesse. Comfortably Numb was developed for “expert owners” who wanted a high-performance displacement vessel capable of traversing the globe. To that end, the all-aluminum cruiser has a draft of under eight feet that allows it to cruise in the shallow waters of the Caribbean, for instance. (For comparison’s sake, 200-foot steel superyacht, like say, [Majestic](https://www.merlewood.com/luxury-yacht-for-sale-52676/majestic-yacht-specs), has a draft of around 11 feet.) It also meets the rigorous IMO Tier-III emissions standards, meaning it can cruise in protected waters. To meet the exacting weight and speed requirements stipulated by the owner, CRN also incorporated innovative technologies and materials into the design. The Italian yard created a system of precise strain gauges, for example, that constantly monitor the vessel’s weight and center of gravity via Wi-Fi. The team also opted to use lightweight cork during the application and leveling of the teak decking rather than other higher-density alternatives. As a result, the yacht has a lower fighting weight and is faster on the waves. Comfortably Numb is also the first CRN fleet member to be equipped with two MTU 20V 4000 M93L engines. This setup allows the yacht to reach a top speed of over 25 knots and a cruising speed of 22.5 knots. In addition, a SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system ensures bump-free jaunts. Comfortably Numb has a distinctive stylistic identity like her namesake, too. Inspired by automotive design, the 197-footer showcases long, sleek lines and a sharp, pointed bow. “The sculpted silhouette and bold exterior styling are eye-catching even from a distance, breathing life into a one-of-a-kind, full-custom icon,” CRN said in a statement. The light-filled interior is characterized by soaring ceilings and large floor-to-ceiling windows that provide sweeping ocean views. Spanning five decks, the yacht can accommodate up to 12 guests across six suites and 13 crew. She also has generous living areas and an outdoor Jacuzzi. Pink Floyd would be proud.",

    "text": "„Geschmacklos“: Müller-Produkt stößt Kundin auf – Drogeriemarkt zieht Konsequenzen\nEine Müller-Kundin findet ein anzügliches Modellbau-Set in der Spielwarenabteilung. Der Drogeriemarkt reagiert prompt. Auch der Hersteller äußert sich.\nMünchen – Ein unscheinbares Modellbau-Set erregt aktuell viel Aufsehen: Das Figuren-Set „Voyeure“ der Firma NOCH aus Wangen im Allgäu zeigt halbnackte Frauen, einen Mann mit Fernglas – und ein Kind, das sich die Augen zuhält. Es ist Teil einer Produktreihe für Modelleisenbahn-Landschaften. Das eigentlich unauffällige Set aus dem Standardsortiment wurde zum Zentrum einer hitzigen Debatte über Geschmack, Ethik und die Grenzen der Miniaturdarstellung.\nAuslöser für den Wirbel war eine Beschwerde: Christine B. entdeckte das Set in der Spielwarenabteilung einer Müller-Filiale in München. Gegenüber Bild kritisierte sie: „Hier wird Voyeurismus verharmlost und Kindern als harmlose Unterhaltung vermittelt.“ Für sie sei das „nicht nur geschmacklos, sondern auch höchst verantwortungslos.“\nFiguren-Set verschwindet nach Beschwerde von Kundin aus dem Müller-Sortiment\nDer Drogeriemarkt Müller reagierte prompt. Ein Sprecher des Unternehmens erklärte gegenüber der BILD-Zeitung: „Beim Handelskonzern Müller legen wir größten Wert auf ein verantwortungsvolles und familienfreundliches Sortiment. […] Die betreffenden Artikel wurden umgehend entfernt.“ Man bedaure den Vorfall sehr und prüfe derzeit, wie ähnliche Fehler in Zukunft vermieden werden könnten. Das Figuren-Set ist mittlerweile aus dem Sortiment und Online-Handel entfernt worden.\nDie Firma Noch GmbH, ein traditionsreiches Familienunternehmen mit 114-jähriger Geschichte und europäischer Marktführerschaft im Bereich Modellbauzubehör, zeigt sich angesichts der Empörung gelassen. Geschäftsführer Rainer Noch erklärte gegenüber dem SWR: „Die Verkaufszahlen haben am Dienstagmorgen schon deutlich angezogen.“ Er rechne damit, dass das Set bald ausverkauft sein werde. Dass gerade dieses Figuren-Set für Diskussionen sorgt, verwundert Noch: „Die Realität kennt keine Tabus, und um ein wirklichkeitsnahes Abbild zu schaffen, ist es notwendig, auch jene Aspekte darzustellen, die zum menschlichen Leben gehören.“ Das Set sei seit Jahren im Sortiment und habe bislang kaum Kritik ausgelöst.\nHersteller äußert sich: „Wir wollen das Leben in all seinen Facetten darstellen“\nDas Set „Voyeure“ ist Teil einer Linie von Miniaturfiguren, mit denen Noch laut eigener Website „humorvolle oder ungewöhnliche Szenen“ darstellen will. Im Online-Shop wird es als geeignet für „erotische Szenen in Ihrer Modelllandschaftsgestaltung“ beworben. Die Figuren sind übliche Miniaturfiguren, wie man sie zum Beispiel aus dem Miniaturwunderland in Hamburg kennt. Während kritische Stimmen, wie die von Christine B., das Set als sexualisierte Darstellung mit problematischer Botschaft einstufen, betont der Hersteller seine künstlerische und realitätsnahe Freiheit. „Wir wollen das Leben in all seinen Facetten darstellen,“ sagte Rainer Noch gegenüber dem SWR.\nDie Aufmerksamkeit ist für das Unternehmen aus dem Allgäu offenbar kein Nachteil. Bereits auf der Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg präsentierte die Noch GmbH eine neue Linie namens „Funny-Scenes“, die Sets mit Bezeichnungen wie „Saufbrüder“, „Seitensprung“ oder „Straßenstrich“ umfasst. Diese sollen ab Oktober im Handel erhältlich sein. Das, was der eine lustig findet, dem anderen sauer aufstößt, ist keine Seltenheit. So erhiet etwa auch ein Mafia-Brettspiel heftigen Gegenwind.

    "text": "Indian Army Awards Contract to Johnnette Technologies for Supply of Made-in-India Johnnette JF-2 Tactical, India’s First Crash Resistant Drone Johnnette Technologies, a leading Indian Unmanned Systems manufacturer headquartered in Noida, has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its flagship tactical fixed-wing UAV, the Johnnette JF-2, for border surveillance. The company proudly asserts that the JF-2 is India’s first crash-resistant drone, representing a significant milestone in the nation’s pursuit of self-reliance in defense manufacturing. Founded in 2014 by Lt Cdr John Livingstone, a retired Indian Navy officer, Johnnette Technologies has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge unmanned systems technology for both military and commercial applications in India. The company’s commitment aligns with the ‘Make in India’ initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Lt Cdr John Livingstone, Founder, and CEO of Johnnette Technologies, expressed his pride in contributing to national security: “It is a great feeling to be able to serve the nation even after retiring from the Defence Forces. My team has done prolonged R&D and have created this tactical fixed-wing UAV, Johnnette JF-2, for the Military requirements. The uniqueness of our lightweight JF-2 is its ability to be crash-resistant in multiple terrains due to its sturdy belly-landing design.” The Johnnette JF-2 is a hand-launched fixed-wing tactical UAV designed specifically for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. Equipped with a high-definition day camera and a thermal imaging camera, the platform is tailored for day and night operations. Noteworthy features include a crash-proof avionics bay, anti-jamming, and anti-spoofing capabilities, making it an ideal solution for land forces. This marks the first deployment of a fixed-wing UAV in its class by the Indian Army for border surveillance. Johnnette Technologies Pvt Ltd., established in November 2014, has been a trailblazer in Unmanned Systems Technology in India. The company has consistently delivered cutting-edge aerospace systems to the paramilitary, commercial, aerospace, and defense sectors, with a primary focus on unmanned systems technology. In addition to the Johnnette JF-2, the company also manufactures low-cost loitering munitions (Kamikaze drones) and has ambitious plans to produce Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) in the future. As India continues to strengthen its indigenous defense capabilities, Johnnette Technologies’ innovative contributions underscore the growing role of domestic firms in meeting the evolving requirements of the armed forces.

    "title": "Die Stadt der Kanäle - und Taschendiebe",
    "text": "Man hätte gewarnt sein können. Die Hinweistafeln hängen ja in der ganzen Stadt, am Bahnhof Santa Lucia, auf dem Markusplatz, an den Vaporetto-Anlegestellen, und das in allen möglichen Sprachen. \"Attenzione borseggiatori\". \"Attention pickpockets\". \"Beware pickpockets\". Und \"Achtung Taschendiebe\" selbstverständlich auch. Aber dann ist das Portemonnaie halt doch nicht mehr in der Hosentasche. So geht es in Venedig ein paar Dutzend Urlaubern jeden Tag.\nWas das Delikt Taschendiebstahl in der Kriminalitätsstatistik angeht, kann die italienische Lagunenstadt mit ihren nicht einmal mehr 50.000 Einwohnern locker mit Millionenmetropolen mithalten. Vor allem jetzt in der Hauptsaison: Die täglich bis zu 150.000 Besucher aus aller Welt versprechen lohnende Beute. In den engen Gassen sind keineswegs nur Kleinkriminelle aktiv, sondern richtige Banden: Männer, Frauen, Kinder. Und auch sie kommen in der Regel von außerhalb, Tagesbesucher sozusagen.\nIn Venedig ein altes Problem\nNun ist das Problem mit den geklauten Geldbörsen in Venedig nicht ganz neu. Die Lokalzeitung \"Il Gazzettino\" klagte schon 1961: \"Nessun giorno senza ladri\" (\"Kein Tag ohne Diebe\"). Mit dem zunehmenden Tourismus ist es inzwischen aber so schlimm geworden, dass Bürgermeister Luigi Brugnaro jetzt einen Hilferuf an Regierung und Parlament in Rom richtet - was die Venezianer mit ihrem in mehr als anderthalb Jahrtausenden angesammelten Stolz eher ungern tun. Er fordert dringend härtere Gesetze.\n-\nAuf dem Markusplatz ist die Gefahr besonders groß. (Archivbild) Foto: Christoph Sator/dpa\nEinen Eindruck, wie groß das Problem inzwischen ist, bekommt man im Polizeirevier gegenüber dem Markusdom. Dort gibt es einen Raum mit 15 schwarzen Säcken voller Taschen und Brieftaschen - allein die Fundstücke aus den vergangenen anderthalb Monaten. In der Regel werfen die Diebe ihre Beute weg, wenn sie das Bargeld und die Kreditkarten herausgenommen haben. An Ausweispapieren sind sie wenig interessiert. Man findet die Portemonnaies dann auf dem Pflaster, in Briefkästen, in Gärten oder auch in den Kanälen.\nDie \"baby borseggiatori\" - die \"Baby-Taschendiebe\"\nLängst handelt es sich dabei um organisierte Kriminalität, das Werk von Banden. Meist sind es Leute vom Festland, aus Städten wie Mailand, die für ihr kriminelles Tagwerk nach Venedig gebracht werden, manchmal eigens in Kleinbussen. Inzwischen werden sogar Kinder im Alter von 12 oder 13 Jahren erwischt - gerade noch unter 14, der Altersgrenze für Strafbarkeit. Man nennt sie \"baby borseggiatori\": \"Baby-Taschendiebe\". Auf Italienisch klingt das natürlich besser und harmloser. Meist kommen sie nach ein paar Stunden auf dem Revier am selben Tag wieder frei.\n-\nAn den Anlegestellen von Gondeln und Fähren empfiehlt die Polizei besondere Wachsamkeit. (Archivbild) Foto: Christoph Sator/dpa\nAls besonders gefährliche Gegenden gelten Santa Lucia, wo die Züge vom Festland ankommen, der Busbahnhof an der Piazzale Roma, die Anlegestellen der Gondeln und sonstigen Boote sowie die engen Gassen zwischen Rialtobrücke und Markusplatz. Manchmal ist dort in diesen Tagen kaum noch ein Durchkommen. Im dichten Gedränge haben Taschendiebe leichtes Spiel. Zwar hat die Stadt mehr als 850 Überwachungskameras aufhängen lassen. Die Aufnahmen laufen auf einer der vielen Inseln in einem Kontrollraum zusammen, der rund um die Uhr besetzt ist. Aber bis die Beamten da sind, ist es oft zu spät.\nPolizeichef: \"Große Blase der Straflosigkeit\"\nAußerdem, und das sorgt aktuell für enorm Ärger, ist die Gefahr, ins Gefängnis zu müssen, auch für erwischte Diebe nicht hoch. Polizeichef Marco Agostini klagte diese Woche in der Tageszeitung \"Corriere della Sera\" über eine \"große Blase der Straflosigkeit\". \"Weil Taschendiebstähle nur auf Anzeige hin verfolgt werden können. Und wenn der Beraubte nicht zur Verhandlung erscheint, gilt die Anzeige als fallengelassen.\" Die meisten Opfer sind Ausländer. Viele reisen am selben Tag wieder ab. So kommt es nur selten zum Prozess. Derzeit sitzen wegen Taschendiebstählen in Venedig gerade einmal vier Häftlinge ein.\nBürgermeister Brugnaro forderte die Politik in Rom deshalb in einem landesweit verbreiteten Appell auf, die Gesetze zu verschärfen. Eine vor einiger Zeit verabschiedete Reform, wonach zahlreiche kleinere Delikte nur noch auf Antrag der Geschädigten verfolgt werden, will er rückgängig machen. Bislang gab es jedoch nur einige kleinere Änderungen; beim Taschendiebstahl blieb alles beim Alten. \"Wir dürfen uns nicht daran gewöhnen, dass solche Delikte zum Alltag gehören\", so der Bürgermeister.",
