    "text": "Kiowa Casinos holds grand opening ceremony for the Elk Creek Kiowa Casino\nLAWTON, Okla. (KSWO) - Kiowa Casinos held a grand opening ceremony on July 23, for the Elk Creek Kiowa Casino.\nThe new Hobart location was opened with a tribal blessing, opening remarks from tribal leadership and community partners, and the official cutting of the ribbon.\nThe new casino’s general manager, David Perez, was impassioned to discuss the many opportunities that this opening will bring to the community.\n“Now that we have a casino here, we have so many ways that we can create jobs, different pathways, education programs, training programs, for you to come into these doors and be somebody,” Perez said. “I remember 15 years ago, I was given that opportunity. I was a security guard, and I worked my way up, learnt skills, and became the person I am today. So, I want to be an example for that. We have so many people here that have the same story that I do, and I just wanna be able to open that door for many people in the future.\nThe 25,000 square foot location features over 250 slot machines, table games, bar, and the debut of a full-service Boomarang Diner.\nCopyright 2025 KSWO.

    "text": "OSAGE COUNTY, Okla. — A 10-year-old in Osage county is donating part of his pumpkin patch proceeds to a cancer center in Bartlesville. His family says after their own battles with cancer, it was important to him to do what he could to help. “That’s what it’s all about is giving back,” said Glenda Dick, grandmother. We first told you about 10-year-old Casey Dick back in October, when we visited his pumpkin patch in Osage County . Casey was working to raise money for rodeo competition costs and equipment for his horse. Since we shared his story, his family saw an overwhelming response of people wanting to buy pumpkins or make a donation. Casey was able to use the proceeds to pay for all of his rodeo costs, and barrel racing entry fees for both him and his 13-year-old sister, Bailey. “If you give with an open heart, it’s going to come back to you, and it really has,” Glenda said. “This pumpkin patch went from just a few, you know, he might have made close to $100 each year to making $1,000, so it came back to us already.” And with the money leftover, Casey and Bailey were able to make a donation to Hopestone Cancer Support Center of Bartlesville. “It was really good because we got to help some of the cancer stuff, and it just felt really good,” Casey said. Casey’s father was set to take over the family ranch when their grandparents retire, but tragically, the kids lost their dad to cancer about six years ago. Then, their grandpa had to retire due to his own fight with cancer. That’s when Casey decided to step up to keep the ranch going. Thankfully, their grandfather has successfully beat cancer, so the kids wanted to give $113 of their remaining pumpkin sales to the center as a thank you. “It felt good, and I was really happy about it because I like to help people,” Bailey said. “I’m sure you can tell, I am proud of my grandkids,” Glenda said. “I think they’re two of the best grandkids any grandmother can have.” The family plans to continue to raise money for the cancer center moving forward, and they hope to inspire others to do the same. “Hopefully it won’t be the last time they see my grandkids, and more donations hopefully are on the way,” Glenda said. Casey says he is planning to run his pumpkin patch again next fall, and he and his sister both plan to make it a tradition to always try to give back a portion of what they earn.",

    "title": "Friday has chances for both morning frost and afternoon strong storms",
    "text": "There are two threats for Friday: one is the potential for morning frost and the second is afternoon thunderstorms that could become strong to severe. First, the frost. A Freeze Warning is in effect for Rusk County and a Frost Advisory is in effect for Barron, Chippewa, Clark, Eau Claire, Jackson, Taylor, and Trempealeau counties from 2am until 8am Friday morning. Cover up or bring inside any sensitive plants you have put outside. It is most likely outside of the Eau Claire-Altoona-Lake Hallie-Chippewa Falls metro area with the greatest chance north and east of Eau Claire. Still, patchy frost can't be ruled out anywhere in the Chippewa Valley even outside of the alert area. Frost is possible when low temps drop to 36, but doesn't become likely until the low drops to 34. The exact air temperature frost forms at depends on several factors, including wind speed and availability of near-ground moisture. It requires the temperature within inches of the ground to hit the freezing mark, but all of our temperature sensors and forecast low temps are for 2 meters above the ground, so that's why the ice can form on grass and trees when the air temp is above freezing. That makes it difficult to track when the average date is for the last frost of the year, but the average last 34 or colder low temperature is May 14. Any evening shower tonight will end before 9pm, and then the sky will clear out to allow for these colder low temperatures tonight into tomorrow morning. Tomorrow will begin sunny, but a few clouds will begin to form ahead of the afternoon chances for scattered showers and storms. Expect them to begin after noon in Polk County and arrive in the Chippewa River Valley between 2 and 4 PM. A few isolated showers and storms will continue after that first broken line moves through, though chances quickly decrease during the late evening and the sky will clear out overnight into Saturday morning. Western Wisconsin is yet again under the Storm Prediction Center's (SPC's) level 1 risk for severe weather, meaning that an isolated severe storm is possible. The main threat will be marginally severe straight-line wind gusts. The severe threshold is 60 mph wind, and the strongest storm may be capable of hitting that mark. Hail is a very low secondary threat while tornadoes and flash flooding are both incredibly low risk, if not zero risk. Temperatures will warm up this weekend with highs near 70 with sunshine on Saturday and possibly hitting 80 for the first time this year on Mother's Day Sunday! There is a return of a slight chance for showers and storms in the afternoon and evening on Mother's Day, with isolated showers and possibly storms possible Sunday and Monday. Tuesday looks dry before better chances for rain and storms arrive Wednesday and Thursday.",

La estación de esquí de Sierra Nevada ha cerrado este viernes por las fuertes rachas de viento que se registran, según ha informado Cetursa. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología anuncia viento moderado o fuerte del este y sureste, con rachas muy fuertes en cotas altas y zonas expuestas a primeras horas.

    "title": "A year after auto strike, Stellantis workers face an uncertain future : NPR",
    "text": "In a major win for the UAW, Stellantis agreed in late 2023 to reopen its plant in Belvidere, Ill., investing in a new parts hub in 2024, a new stamping operation in 2025, and production of a new midsize truck in 2027. Stellantis has since delayed those plans, citing market conditions. Scott Olson/Getty Images North America hide caption\ntoggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images North America TOLEDO, Ohio — For months last year, United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain had warned the Big 3 automakers that September 14 was not a suggestion, but a deadline.\nAfter failing to reach new contracts by the stroke of midnight, he kept his word, calling on workers at three major assembly plants to walk off the job.\nNow a year later, there’s no doubt autoworkers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, formerly Chrysler, are earning more money. For some, significantly more.\nAt the same time, Stellantis workers say they face a highly uncertain future, with little faith that their new record contracts , achieved after a painful six-week strike, will keep their jobs intact.\nSponsor Message “This is the lowest that morale's been in the 11 years that I've been here,” says Jim Cooper, a team leader at Stellantis’ Toledo Assembly Complex where the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator are built.\nJim Cooper, a team leader at the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, says morale at the plant today is lower than it's ever been in his 11 years with the company. Andrea Hsu/NPR hide caption\ntoggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR Weaker car sales have dampened contract gains A downturn in sales this year at Stellantis, which formed when Fiat Chrysler merged with the French automaker Peugeot in 2021, has led to production slowdowns at U.S. facilities, layoffs for as many as 2,450 assembly workers outside Detroit next month, and a delay in plans to reopen a plant in Belvidere, Ill.\nIn the first half of this year, Stellantis profits dropped 48% from the year before, the company reported this summer.\nHow inflation is impacting America Are greedy companies to blame for grocery inflation? We looked at the data In August, the company confirmed rumors that it was putting on hold plans to start production of a midsize truck in Belvidere in 2027.\n\"To ensure the company’s future competitiveness and sustainability, which are necessary to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs, it is critical that the business case for all investments is aligned with market conditions,\" the company wrote in a statement. Stellantis declined NPR's request for an interview.\nNow, workers are wondering how committed the trans-Atlantic automaker is to remain in the U.S. at all.\nFor years, Cooper says, old-timers at his plant in Toledo have warned that if wages rose too much, the company would move jobs to Mexico. It's a threat he's always shrugged off, given how profitable the Jeep plant has been for Stellantis.\nUAW vs. the Detroit Big 3 automakers Why you shouldn't be surprised that autoworkers are asking for a 40% pay raise But now?\n\"I could see it,\" he says.\nHigher pay but fewer hours The strike and contract wins last year were supposed to be a turning point for auto workers. After decades of concessions, auto workers were finally getting what the UAW said was long overdue: Raises of 25% or more over the life of the contract, the return of cost-of-living adjustments, and new job protections, including the right to strike over plant closures and in some cases, broken investment promises.\nNational 17,000 AT&T workers have been on strike for three weeks. Here's why. The raises have indeed materialized. Since the strike, pay has jumped by more than $5 an hour, including a cost-of-living adjustment, for most workers. Some temporary workers who were converted to permanent, full-time employees under the new contract have seen their hourly wages nearly double.\nBut scheduled overtime, common in the auto industry, has fallen dramatically, cutting into workers' paychecks. Last year, Cooper says he was routinely working 60 hours a week to meet production demands. That has since evaporated.\nUAW vs. the Detroit Big 3 automakers Sky-high CEO pay is in focus as workers everywhere are demanding higher wages Not only has there been far less overtime for workers, but over the past three weeks, production in Toledo and elsewhere has been halted for a couple days at a time as too many cars remain on dealer lots.\n\"My checks are smaller than they were before the strike,\" says Cooper.\nOf course, there are upsides to working less.\n\"I don't feel like a zombie in the afternoon. I can go do stuff with the kids, go to Scouts, do some yard work,\" he says.\nSponsor Message \"But losing overtime is a big hit.\"\nA strike threat over broken promises Losing American auto jobs all together would be an even bigger hit, and something the UAW is fighting aggressively to prevent.\nLast month, the union began a formal grievance process over the delay in reopening Belvidere. That process could eventually lead to a strike at one or multiple plants, even as the union and Stellantis spar over whether a strike would even be legal under the current contract.\nWhile the UAW won the right to strike over the failure to fulfill product and investment commitments, Stellantis has pointed to what's essentially an escape clause in the contract, allowing them to push back investments if market conditions change. The UAW argues that the company is at fault for failing to plan for and fund its commitments.\nUAW President Shawn Fain speaks on the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, on August 19, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images \"Let me be clear, Stellantis must keep the promises made to America in our union contract,\" Fain said in a fiery speech before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last month. He vowed that the union would take \"whatever action necessary\" to hold the company accountable.\nMarick Masters, professor emeritus at Wayne State University, says behind the scenes, the two sides are no doubt negotiating in an effort to avoid another strike. But with the headwinds facing carmakers — not only slower sales but also the costly transition to EVs — he says the UAW is in a bit of a quandary.\n\"There's no language that I can find in that memorandum of understanding that explicitly gives the union the right to strike\" given the current conditions, he says.\nIn Toledo, Cooper says unlike last fall, he has little hope that a strike would be successful anyway.\n\"We would probably stand out here by burn barrels in the cold for two weeks, and then have a judge tell us, 'Go back to work or you'll be fired,'\" he says.\nCooper on the picket line outside the Jeep plant on October 3, 2023. \"A year ago, it felt like we were fighting for something, and we were going to advance things,\" he says. Andrea Hsu/NPR hide caption\ntoggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR More union wins elsewhere Elsewhere in the U.S. auto industry, there are more positive signs that last year's strike is making a difference for workers — and for the UAW.\nSponsor Message In a major win for the union last fall, General Motors agreed to bring workers from its EV battery joint venture Ultium Cells under the national labor agreement.\nThat's already paying off for 1,600 Ultium workers in Lordstown, Ohio, who this summer ratified a new contract with raises of 30% over three years, and for a thousand more Ultium workers in Spring Hill, Tenn., who joined the UAW earlier this month.\nBusiness A road trip in an electric vehicle doesn't have to be nerve-wracking anymore \"The workers organized without facing threats or intimidation and won their union once a majority of workers signed cards,\" the UAW said in a statement, describing a process known as card check recognition.\nLife-changing raises come with some twists Even at Stellantis, the pay raises have changed some workers' lives.\nKevin Pinson had worked at the Toledo Jeep plant as a temporary employee for six years, far longer than the one to two years he thought it would take to be rolled over to permanent status.\nAs part of last fall's negotiations, the UAW got Stellantis to agree to reduce its heavy reliance on temps and convert several thousand of them to full-time employment. With his tenure at the plant, Pinson was among the first to be converted. His wage went from about $19 an hour at the time of the strike to more than $35 an hour.\nA father of two, Pinson says the raise has given him a cushion — something he desperately needed.\n\"Before the raise, I actually had to donate plasma to make extra income just for bills and stuff,\" he says. \"My hours were not steady.\"\nA restored World War II era Jeep serves as a Veterans memorial outside the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. hide caption\ntoggle caption But there was a catch. Stellantis assigned a group of workers, chosen based on the digits in their social security numbers, to new jobs at a warehouse in Detroit, 90 minutes away. Despite his seniority, Pinson was one of them.\n\"They basically gave us a week notice,\" says Pinson. \"None of us even knew where it was. Never even heard of it.\"\nSponsor Message Suddenly, his work days grew significantly longer. He was leaving home at 3 am to make his 5 am shift. Gas money was eating into his raises. He went from filling his tank once a week to filling it every two days.\nThen in July, he was brought back to Toledo and put on the evening shift, working some nights until 2 am.\nUAW vs. the Detroit Big 3 automakers UAW members aren't all assembling cars. More and more are unionized grad students \"I don't know what the future holds,\" he says. \"There are so many rumors about being laid off until stuff starts selling.\"\nLast fall, even with record raises and the promise of permanent status on the table, Pinson voted against the contract, doubtful that Stellantis would make good on its end of the deal.\nWhile his doubt remains, he's not too worried about his job — at least for now.\n\"We're going to be starting the 2025 [models] soon, so at least we'll have that to build,\" he says.",

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
