    "title": "Some older D-Link routers are vulnerable to attack | Digital Trends",
    "text": "Getty Images A few legacy D-Link routers can be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks since the company refuses to send any updates to patch them up, claiming they have reached end-of-life, as recently posted on its announcement page .\nThe vulnerability is a serious issue since it allows hackers to take control from anywhere in the world and use a stack buffer overflow. This attack sends more data than the buffer size can handle, potentially corrupting critical information like the return address. Thus, hackers can take control of your PC. However, the company did not detail how the threat works, possibly not informing the hackers too much about the issue.\nRecommended Videos The lack of a fix puts users at risk since they are exposed to malware, data theft, spyware installation, DoS attacks, and more. The routers that are at risk include the following:\nDSR-150 DSR-150N DSR-250 DSR-250N DSR-500N DSR-1000N The company’s only solution for those affected is to get a new router, and if that’s what you’re going to do, you may as well buy one of the best routers . Unfortunately, though , four of the listed routers were discontinued this year, which is bad news considering D-Link said, “If a product has reached End of Support (“EOS”) / End of Life (“EOL”), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.”\nRelated AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D details leak, and there’s some bad news TP-Link’s new Kasa mesh router doubles as an Alexa smart speaker The 20% discount D-Link offers on new routers is a nice gesture, but the report says many of the listed routers are open to third-party firmware. That’s not a great solution since it voids the warranty.\nBut let’s face it: when a device becomes obsolete, it makes sense that the company wants to forget about it and concentrate on the new models.\nEditors’ Recommendations Oh great, new malware lets hackers hijack your Wi-Fi router TP-Link’s Wi-Fi 6E router comes with motorized antennas for better reception TP-Link’s new blazing-fast Wi-Fi 6E routers coming later in 2021",

    "text": "La Casa Blanca afirmó este jueves que no está considerando otorgar un perdón presidencial al f [undador de WikiLeaks, Julian Assange](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/mundo/2024/6/26/assange-ya-esta-en-australia-arriba-al-pais-tras-quedar-en-libertad-por-acuerdo-con-eu-822003.html), como lo han solicitado sus abogados. La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Karine Jean-Pierre, respondió con un escueto \"no\" cuando los periodistas a bordo del avión presidencial Air Force One le preguntaron si se estaba considerando esa opción. La pregunta surgió a raíz de las declaraciones de los abogados de Assange y de su esposa, Stella Assange, quienes en las últimas horas anunciaron que pedirán al presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, un perdón presidencial con el objetivo de limpiar el historial delictivo de Assange. Esta semana, Assange selló con el Departamento de Justicia de EU un acuerdo judicial por el que se declaró culpable de un cargo penal relacionado con la mayor filtración de documentos clasificados de la historia de Estados Unidos, ocurrida en 2010 y que cuestionó el papel de ese país en el mundo al revelar atrocidades en las guerras de Irak y Afganistán. Assange ya es hombre libre A cambio de reconocer su responsabilidad, Assange fue condenado formalmente a 62 meses de cárcel, pero se le dio crédito por el tiempo que ya había cumplido en una prisión de alta seguridad en el Reino Unido. De esta manera, pudo salir en libertad y regresar a su Australia natal. El fundador de WikiLeaks llegó el miércoles a Camberra, Australia en un avión privado después de haber formalizado el pacto para su libertad ante un juez de las Islas Marianas del Norte (EU), tras pasar cinco años recluido en el Reino Unido y otros casi siete refugiado en la embajada de Ecuador en Londres. \"Tras casi 14 años de detención arbitraria en Reino Unido, y 5 años en una prisión de máxima seguridad por su trabajo innovador, Julian Assange ha regresado a casa en Australia\", apuntó WikiLeaks en su cuenta de X. El australiano fue recibido en la pista de aterrizaje por su esposa, Stella Assange, a quien besó y con quien se fundió en un abrazo, y por su padre, el arquitecto australiano John Shipton.",
