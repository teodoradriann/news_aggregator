[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 26-04-2024 03:11 IST | Created: 26-04-2024 03:11 IST Haiti's transition council took power in a ceremony on Thursday, formalizing the resignation of former Prime Minster Ariel Henry as the Caribbean country seeks to establish security after years of gang violence wreaking chaos and misery. Henry's finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister until the transition council appoints a new head of government, a cabinet and a provisional electoral council set to pave the way for an eventual vote. \"Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution,\" Boisvert said after the nine-person transition council were sworn in on Thursday morning. Regine Abraham, a non-voting council member, thanked Haiti's security forces and international mediators, and said the council would focus on security, a national consultation on constitutional reform, preparing for elections, rebuilding the judiciary system and the economy. \"We are seeing the total collapse of our institutions and failure of a government,\" she said. Port-au-Prince residents have \"literally been taken hostage,\" she added. \"Facing this unprecedented crisis, the entire population has recognized the urgent need of a firm hand to take us out of this spiral of despair and destruction.\" Even as the council was sworn in, local media reported houses being set on fire and shooting in the capital's downtown and Delmas areas, posting photos of tall columns of gray smoke rising above the skyline and videos of families leaving the area with their belongings. Armed gangs, equipped with weapons trafficked largely from the United States, have for years tightened their grip on the capital and sought to topple Henry. Since he pledged to resign last month, they have called for a broader \"revolution\". Earlier this week, gang leader Jimmy \"Barbeque\" Cherizier warned members of the transition council to \"brace\" themselves. Unverified voice recordings circulated on social media over the weekend in which Cherizier appeared to order his soldiers to indiscriminately burn houses in Lower Delmas, an impoverished part of the capital where he grew up. At the ceremony, hosted amid tight security at the prime minister's Villa d'Accueil office, Boisvert and members of the transition council were flanked by top police and military officials. Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place, initially expected to happen within a couple of days but delayed amid disagreements as to who should sit on it. Henry had left Haiti in late February seeking support for the country's outgunned police, but was left stranded in Puerto Rico as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Boisvert has served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence. The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed. No date has been set for its naming of a new prime minister or council president. SECOND PHASE \"We just hope the council will quickly choose a president or coordinator in order to move onto the second phase, which is the appointment of a prime minister and the members of government,\" said James Boyard, a security expert at the State University of Haiti. \"The new transitional government has a lot of work ahead of it, and alongside security all the issues are urgent.\" Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, warned of tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, and a \"long and rocky road ahead.\" Local organization Together Against Corruption (ECC) published a letter calling on the new authorities to be financially transparent to \"prove their will to help build a government that breaks with the past.\" The council's installation is seen as a key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission Henry requested back in 2022 and the United Nations approved over six months ago. Though Kenya offered to lead this mission, plans were put on hold last month pending the establishment of a new Haitian government. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the new authorities to swiftly implement new governance arrangements to allow for the mission's deployment. The mission has received less cash and troops than the U.N. has said it needs. The council members must, as per the decree installing them, support the mission's \"accelerated deployment.\" But some Haitians are wary after previous international interventions left behind a deadly cholera outbreak and sexual abuse scandal. Others hope the mission could help restore much-needed security and pave the way for eventual elections. According to U.N. estimates, more than 2,500 people were killed or injured in gang violence from January through March, while hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced and millions are facing catastrophic hunger. Key ports have been closed for over a month, but on Thursday Florida-based non-profit Hope for Haiti said a first humanitarian flight since the capital's airport shut down had landed in Port-au-Prince: a U.S. military plane bringing 20 pallets of rehydration solution for cholera patients. The U.S. government welcomed the installation of the council on Thursday, saying it marked a step towards free and fair elections, while several ambassadors to the country hailed the ceremony as an important step to reestablish security. The council members installed were the same as announced last week: seven voting members, all men, including representatives from various political parties as well as former diplomats, a barrister, and a businessman, and two non-voting observers: a pastor and former government adviser. \"We continue the fight for the transformation of our country,\" former central bank governor Fritz Alphonse Jean, one of the council members, said on X. \"The country needs the talents of all its sons and daughters here and in the diaspora for the construction of the new Haiti.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "title": "How to Build a UI/UX Portfolio That Gets You Hired - Employment & Business News",
    "text": "Breaking into the UI/UX design field — or leveling up your current role — depends heavily on the strength of your portfolio. In a landscape where attention spans are short and first impressions matter, your portfolio needs to showcase more than just beautiful screens. It must tell a story, reflect your design thinking, and prove that you can solve real problems for real users.\nThat’s where services like uitop.design come in. Whether you’re creating your first case study or refreshing an outdated portfolio, uitop.design helps designers structure their work professionally, emphasize business impact, and present their skills with clarity. They specialize in helping UI/UX designers, startups, and product teams elevate their interfaces — and their stories — to a higher standard.\nStart With Strategy, Not Screens\nBefore you open Figma, take a step back. Think about the story you want your portfolio to tell. Are you showcasing user-centric problem solving? A knack for clean UI? Or deep research and usability testing? Structure your portfolio to reflect your unique value, not just your visual style.\nA great portfolio includes 3–5 strong projects, each walking the viewer through your process: the problem, your role, the research, ideation, wireframes, testing, and final solution. This structure mirrors what hiring managers look for — your ability to think, not just design.\nShow Business Value, Not Just Aesthetics\nOne common mistake junior designers make is focusing too much on aesthetics. While clean visuals matter, employers want to see how your design choices impacted real metrics — increased conversions, reduced churn, improved task completion rates, and so on. That’s why working with a studio like uitop.design can be game-changing: they design with business goals in mind and help professionals reflect that same focus in their case studies.\nDon’t Forget Mobile, Accessibility & Microinteractions\nThe modern portfolio should showcase responsiveness and accessibility. Include mobile and tablet versions where applicable, demonstrate awareness of WCAG principles, and, if possible, highlight the role of microinteractions in improving UX. Even a simple GIF of a hover animation can leave a lasting impression.\nMake It Personal (But Not Cluttered)\nAdd a short, thoughtful “About Me” section — no need for clichés like “I’m passionate about design.” Instead, share how you think, how you collaborate, and what kind of problems excite you. And keep the layout clean: let your work do the talking.\nTools and Platforms That Help You Build Better Portfolios\nHere are some recommended tools and platforms to level up your portfolio:\n- Figma – for UI/UX design and prototyping\n- Notion – to document your case studies and research\n- Behance and Dribbble – for exposure and feedback\n- Webflow or Framer – to create an interactive portfolio site\n- uitop.design – for expert help with professional presentation and UX-focused storytelling\nWhat Recruiters Actually Look For\nWhen hiring managers and recruiters scan your portfolio, they’re often looking for:\n- Clear problem definitions and user goals\n- Thoughtful wireframes and UX decisions\n- High-fidelity UI and consistency\n- Measurable outcomes or project impact\n- Clean presentation and intuitive navigation\n- Bonus: collaboration with teams or developers\nFinal Thoughts\nA UI/UX portfolio is more than a gallery — it’s your design voice. With the right storytelling, structure, and presentation, you can open doors to top design roles. And if you’re stuck or need a professional touch, uitop.design is a trusted ally in transforming good work into unforgettable narratives.\nLet your portfolio be the one that speaks before you do.",

    "text": "Pythom Inc. Pythom Inc.'s lease agreement for rocket testing at the Tonopah Airport is in jeopardy, with a notice of intent to terminate recently issued by the county due to the company's failure to comply with FAA requirements. Two years ago, Swedish-American based aerospace company Pythom Inc. secured a five-year lease with Nye County for land at the Tonopah Airport, a location the company feels is prime for its rocket testing. However, Pythom’s apparent refusal to adhere to recently issued requirements laid down by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has now prompted the county to put the company on notice – if it does not do as required by mid-December, the lease will be terminated.\n“Back in 2022, we went into an agreement with Pythom to do standing rocket testing at the Tonopah Airport. Beginning of this year, they approached the FAA to do hot testing, which brought them under the light of the FAA,” Nye County Utilities Superintendent Darrin Tuck told Nye County commissioners this month.\nHot testing differs from static rocket testing in that static tests, as the name implies, occur with the rocket engine mounted on a stand firmly affixed to the ground.\n“So they changed their mind on the hot testing, they wanted to continue with their static testing but the FAA says there are certain requirements they need to meet just to be there,” Tuck detailed. “We’ve approached them a couple of times on this. They feel that is it our responsibility to take care of the FAA and so I think we need a serious approach to get them into compliance.”\n“Bring down the hammer,” commission chair Debra Strickland affirmed. She then added that the action being considered was simply a notice of intent, not a formal termination, leading commissioner Frank Carbone to ask about the termination timeline.\n“We’re giving them until Dec. 15 to decide they want to comply with FAA and if not, I can put an item on the (Dec.) 17th meeting to issue that termination,” interim Nye County Manager Lorina Dellinger explained.\nCommissioner Bruce Jabbour made the motion to issue the notice of intent to terminate the lease, with a second from Carbone. The motion passed with all in favor.\nContact reporter Robin Hebrock at rhebrock@pvtimes.com",

Está muy claro para la mayoría del pueblo venezolano, Estados Unidos y un número creciente de países que Edmundo González Urrutia obtuvo la mayor cantidad de votos el 28 de julio”, dijo el jueves un portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.\nBiden había dicho a los periodistas “Sí, lo apoyo”, cuando se le preguntó sobre su respaldo a la idea de unas nuevas elecciones en el país.\nEl presidente estaba hablando con los periodistas en el Jardín Sur de la Casa Blanca después de que los líderes de Brasil y Colombia hicieran comentarios similares durante este jueves.\nLa respuesta, luego fue aclarada en los términos expresados por el portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.\nEl presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, sugirió este jueves”nuevas elecciones libres”, en un mensaje publicado a través de su perfil de X.\nEsas declaraciones vienen después de que, Celso Amorim, el principal asesor de política internacional del presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, propuso celebrar nuevas elecciones para contrarrestar la crisis generada en el país por la controversia sobre el ganador de los comicios del 28 de julio.\nEn tanto, la líder opositora María Corina Machado rechazó la posibilidad de celebrar nuevas elecciones como solución a la profunda crisis política del país.\nCon información de Samantha Waldenberg, Stefano Pozzebon, Ivonne Valdés, de CNN.",

    "text": "Revolutionary Alzheimer's Treatment Creates Hope as NKGen Biotech Announces Promising Results\nPublished / Modified Dec 28 2023\nCSIMarket Team / CSIMarket.com\nNKGen Biotech,Inc. Announces Promising Results in its Groundbreaking Alzheimer's Treatment Trial\nIn a groundbreaking development, NKGen Biotech, a leading biotechnology company, has recently initiated the first patient dosing for its Phase 1/2a clinical trial utilizing their autologous natural killer (NK) cell product, known as SNK01. This innovative treatment aims to address the urgent need for effective therapies for patients suffering from moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide.\nRecent findings from NKGen Biotech's Phase 1 dose-escalation safety trial have demonstrated promising results, showcasing the potential of SNK01 to improve neuroinflammation and cognitive function among AD patients. The trial involved carefully selecting and administering autologous NK cells to patients, with the aim of harnessing the innate immune system's ability to combat the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's Disease.\nNeuroinflammation, characterized by chronic inflammation in the brain, is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. By\neffectively targeting and reducing neuroinflammation,NKGen's SNK01 product candidate offers a novel approach to combating the disease and potentially slowing its progression. The Phase 1 safety trial showed encouraging improvements in both neuroinflammation levels and cognitive function among the participants, signifying a significant step forward in Alzheimer's research.\nNKGen Biotech's dedication to advancing Alzheimer's therapeutics is driven by their mission to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of life for those affected by this devastating disease. With the initiation of their Phase 1/2a trial, the company is taking steadfast strides towards developing a viable treatment option that could potentially transform the lives of millions of individuals worldwide.\nThe groundbreaking potential of SNK01 lies in its utilization of the patient's own NK cells, which are carefully modified and expanded before being reintroduced into the body. This autologous approach eliminates the risk of rejection, making it a safe and promising treatment alternative. By harnessing the strength of NK cells, which possess extraordinary capabilities in identifying and eliminating abnormal cells, NKGen Biotech aims to redefine the landscape of Alzheimer's treatment.\nDr. John Collins, Chief Medical Officer at NKGen Biotech, expressed his enthusiasm for the success displayed in the Phase 1 trial, stating, These compelling results provide a solid foundation for moving forward with our Phase 2a trial, and we are eager to delve deeper into the potential therapeutic benefits that SNK01 may offer to Alzheimer's patients.\nLooking ahead, NKGen Biotech is committed to further advancing their novel therapy through subsequent clinical trials. Their Phase 2a trial is set to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of SNK01 in a larger pool of AD patients, aiming to replicate and build upon the positive outcomes observed in the Phase 1 safety trial.\nIn conclusion, the commencement of patient dosing for the Phase 1/2a trial with SNK01 marks a significant milestone in NKGen Biotech's pursuit of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's Disease. With encouraging results from the Phase 1 trial, the company is well-positioned to continue blazing a trail in Alzheimer's research, contributing to the collective effort towards improving the lives of those affected by this devastating disease.\nPrevious News\n<a href=\"https://csimarket.com/news/breaking_news_leading_law_firm_encourages_milestone_pharmaceuticals_inc_investors_to_inquire_about_securities_class_action_investigation_into_potentially_mis2023-12-28210107\">\nBREAKING NEWS: Leading Law Firm Encourages Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc Investors to Inquire About Securities Class Action Investigation into Potentially Misleading Business Information </a> <a href=\"https://csimarket.com/news/allied-gaming-bounces-back-strategic-investment-from-elite-fun-entertainment-a-stepping-stone-to-recoveryn-from-setback-2023-12-28210115\">\nAllied Gaming Bounces Back: Strategic investment from Elite Fun Entertainment, A Stepping-Stone to Recoveryn From Setback to Comeback: Allied Gaming and Entertainment Inc.

Une décision «imprudente» selon la Corée du Nord.\nPublié aujourd’hui à 02h53\nUn hélicoptère Apache, de fabrication américaine, en Pologne le 15 août 2024.

S'abonner Se connecter BotTalk La Corée du Nord a qualifié jeudi d’acte «imprudent et provocant» la vente par les Américains d’hélicoptères Apache à la Corée du Sud, affirmant qu’elle y répondrait par un renforcement de son propre arsenal.\n«Il s’agit d’un acte imprudent et provocant» qui vise à «délibérément augmenter l’instabilité sécuritaire dans la région», a fustigé dans un communiqué le ministère de la Défense nord-coréen.\n36 hélicoptères «Nous nous opposons fermement (…) au renforcement militaire (…) des forces vassales» des États-Unis, a-t-il déclaré, critiquant par la même occasion des ventes récentes américaines au Japon et à d’autres alliés de Washington en Asie-Pacifique.\nLes États-Unis ont annoncé lundi avoir approuvé la vente de jusqu’à 36 hélicoptères d’attaque Apache, ainsi que du matériel lié, dont des missiles, à la Corée du Sud pour un total d’environ 3,5 milliards de dollars (2,9 milliards de francs).\nSelon l’agence américaine pour la coopération en matière de défense (DSCA), elle doit permettre «d’améliorer les capacités de la République de Corée (nom officiel de la Corée du Sud) à faire face aux menaces actuelles et futures» avec «une force capable de dissuader les adversaires».\n«Dissuasion stratégique» La transaction doit encore être validée par le Congrès américain avant d’être effective. Cet accord va amener Pyongyang à «renforcer encore» ses propres moyens de «dissuasion stratégique», a souligné vendredi le régime nord-coréen.\nL’annonce de la vente est intervenue au premier jour des traditionnels exercices militaires annuels menés conjointement par Washington et Séoul. Baptisées «Ulchi Freedom Shield», elles mobiliseront des milliers de militaires jusqu’au 29 août. Washington est le principal allié de Séoul en matière de sécurité.\nNewsletter «Dernières nouvelles» Vous voulez rester au top de l’info? «24 heures» vous propose deux rendez-vous par jour, directement dans votre boîte e-mail.
