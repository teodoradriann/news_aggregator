    "title": "A country in the Pacific sells its citizenship to finance survival of its population in the face of climate",
    "text": "Nauru, a small island in the Pacific, has implemented an unpublished strategy to face the threats derived from climate change. Faced with the growing threat of the increase in sea level, which endangers the habitability of its territory, the country has decided to launch a gold passport program. Through this measure, it seeks to obtain the necessary resources to relocate its population in safer areas, protecting their future against climatic consequences.\nThis measure, taken in response to an existential crisis, underlines how island countries are forced to adopt innovative solutions due to the effects of global warming. Without the necessary resources to counteract these impacts, small nations are forced to explore out of common alternatives to guarantee the survival of its inhabitants.\nYou can see: NASA reveals the only country in South America that would be uninhabitable in 2050 due to lethal temperatures and climate collapse\nWhat is a golden passport and how does it work? The golden passport is a mechanism by which individuals can obtain citizenship in exchange for a significant economic investment. In this case, the initial cost of the citizenship of Nauru is US $ 105,000. This citizenship grants access without visa to countries such as the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.\nAlthough golden passports have been controversial due to their use in situations of high risk and illegal activities, this country has decided to use them to finance their fight against climate change. The income generated by the program will be used to create a plan to relocate 90% of its population in higher and protected areas of climatic threats.\nYou can see: the surprising finding about the ‘memory’ of the trees that affects their survival\nWhy has this country resorted to the sale of citizenship? Nauru faces a serious climate threat, with the increase in sea level, which would be a direct danger to its inhabitants. With just 20 square kilometers, the island is seeing how its lands are invaded by the waters, which affects both the infrastructure and the life of the 12,500 inhabitants. The exploitation of phosphate, which was the main source of income for decades, has left areas of uninhabitable island, which further complicates the situation.\nThe president of the nation, David Adeang, told CNN that, “while the world debates climate action, we must take proactive measures to ensure the future of our nation.” This statement underlines the urgency with which the country must act to guarantee the survival of its population, given the lack of external resources and support.\nHow will the income of the sale of citizenship be used? The funds raised with the sale of citizenship will be used to finance a relocation plan, which will involve transferring a large part of the population to safer areas and less vulnerable to the increase in sea level. The program is expected to generate approximately US $ 5.6 million in the first year, with a long -term projection of reaching US $ 42 million annually. This amount represents a significant percentage of government income, since the program is expected to cover about 19% of the total budget.\nDespite the risks associated with gold passports, this strategy highlights how the countries most vulnerable to climate change are taking innovative measures to obtain financing. Experts such as Kirstin Surak, associate professor of political sociology at the London School of Economics, have highlighted the importance of ensuring that these funds are used transparently and with adequate control to avoid possible abuse.",

Many lizards can lose their tails on purpose and then make them grow back. Many lizards can lose their tails on purpose and then make them grow back. (Image: Unsplash) Nature is full of amazing things, and one of the coolest things is how lizards can grow back their tails. Many lizards can lose their tails on purpose and then make them grow back, a process called autonomy and regeneration. In this article, we'll explore how the lizards are able to regenerate their tails. How do lizards grow back their tails? Lizards have a remarkable ability to grow back their tails through a process called 'autotomy and subsequent regeneration'. We describe the process below: 1. Losing the tail on purpose Lizards have a smart trick to escape from danger. They can drop their tails when a predator is after them. This tail-dropping trick helps distract the predator, giving the lizard a chance to get away. This is the first step in the interesting process of growing a new tail. 2. Broken part squeezes shut When a lizard loses its tail, some special cells make the broken part squeeze shut. This helps stop the lizard from losing too much blood. Also, the lizard's body releases stress hormones, which quickly close up the blood vessels and lessen the impact of losing part of its tail. 3. The regrowth begins After the tail is gone, the lizard begins to grow it back by creating something called a blastema at the spot where it lost its tail. The blastema is a bunch of special cells that can turn into different types of cells needed to rebuild the tail. 4. Lots of new cells Inside the blastema, cells start multiplying very quickly. They make a bunch of new cells that can turn into muscles, bones, skin, and nerves. Special signals guide these cells to do their specific jobs in making a new tail. The role of genetics and epigenetics The process of growing back a tail in lizards is guided by specific genes. These genes tell the cells what to do during tail regrowth, like when to divide, how to repair tissues, and how to create new structures. Another important thing in tail regrowth is epigenetics. This means small changes in how genes are used without changing the actual DNA. Scientists are studying how these changes affect which genes are turned on or off during tail regrowth. Tail regrowth in different lizards While many lizards can grow back their tails really well, some can even make a new tail that looks almost exactly like the original. This includes complex things like the spinal cord and blood vessels. However, not all lizards can do this, and some might only grow back a simpler version of their tail. The ability to regrow tails can vary among lizards. Factors like where they live, what they eat, and how they evolved over time can make a difference in how well they can regrow their tails. Practical implications Scientists are excited about what they can learn from how lizards regrow their tails. 1. Tissue regrowth Scientists hope that understanding the process of how lizards regrow their tails might help them figure out ways to help people heal and grow back tissues in their bodies. 2. Comparing lizards to people Studying how different animals, like lizards, can regrow body parts helps scientists see what is similar and different across species. This helps them find important ideas that might help improve how we heal and grow tissues in our bodies. The process of how a lizard grows back its tail is a miracle of nature that can not only help us understand animals better but also enable us to find new ways of helping people heal and grow stronger. FAQs 1. How do lizards lose their tails, and why? Lizards can voluntarily shed their tails through a process called autotomy. This happens when they feel threatened by a predator. The purpose is to distract the predator with the wriggling tail, giving the lizard a chance to escape. 2. Do all lizard species regrow their tails? No, not all lizard species can regrow their tails. While many lizard species possess the ability to regenerate their tails, the extent of regenerative capacity varies. Some can regrow near-perfect replicas, while others may only regrow simplified versions. 3. How quickly do lizards regrow their tails after shedding? The regrowth rate varies among species, but generally, lizards can regrow their tails within a few weeks to months. The process involves the formation of a regenerative blastema and the subsequent differentiation of cells into the various tissues needed for the tail. 4. Is the regenerated tail identical to the original one? The extent of similarity between the regenerated tail and the original tail depends on the lizard species. Some species can regrow tails with complex structures, including spinal cords and blood vessels, closely resembling the original. Others may regenerate simpler versions of their tails. 5. Does tail regrowth impact a lizard's overall health? In general, tail regrowth does not negatively impact a lizard's overall health. It is a natural and beneficial adaptation that enhances their chances of survival by providing a distraction for predators. The regrown tail typically functions well, allowing the lizard to resume normal activities. [Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news) End of Article Subscribe to our daily Newsletter!
