    "text": "It's always a win when public spaces go greener – especially when it means more room for relaxation and recreation for us. Whether you're a local or just visiting, you'll soon be able to enjoy a brand-new community space in the heart of the city, just steps away from Deák Ferenc tér. The transformation of Városháza Park, located in front of City Hall, was first announced by the City of Budapest in 2021. If all goes to plan, work will begin next year, with plenty of exciting changes and innovations to improve the area's climate and overall livability.\nOnce a private parking lot, the space is set to become Budapest's new main square. Last summer, a pop-up park already gave a taste of what's to come, offering a glimpse into the vision created by Lépték-Terv Landscape Architecture Firm. The full transformation is expected to be completed by 2026, delivering a vibrant new community space to the city.\nHere, the city's new, very green and super cool main square is being created, finally freeing City Hall's 3rd courtyard from its confinement. This space might easily become a central meeting point in the heart of Budapest, in an area where the amount of green space per person is currently the lowest. The conceptual plans for Városháza Park are now complete – wrote Mayor Gergely Karácsony on his Facebook page.\nItt készül a város új, nagyon zöld és nagyon menő főtere, ami felszabadítja végre a Városháza 3-as udvarát a...\nKözzétette:[Karácsony Gergely]–[2025. január 19., vasárnap]\nThe redesign features smart, eco-friendly solutions to help cool the area rather than trap heat. Green space will increase by 50%, rainwater will be collected for watering plants, and a lush green wall will be added to the City Hall façade.\n(Cover photo: City of Budapest)",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.The search was on then.“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "title": "Drivers warned visibility will be down by up to 60% until January 3",
    "text": "Drivers have been warned that fireworks are a driving hazard and can cut visibility by over half. As New Year’s Eve approaches, motoring experts at\nLeaseCar.uk have advised motorists to avoid driving during firework displays.\nAlthough enjoyed during New Year celebrations, fireworks can affect short-term air quality and lead to a significant reduction in visibility which is a hazard for all road users. Using data from meteorological stations throughout the UK, scientists found that on average visibility is reduced by a quarter when there are fireworks.\nIn some parts of the UK, significantly higher visibility reductions have been recorded, including 64% in Nottingham. The visibility-reducing effects can last for up to two days after a fireworks display, meaning drivers should be extra cautious until at least January 3.\nThe reduction in visibility is caused by atmospheric particulate matter from fireworks which is scattered after detonation. If humidity is high, the effects can be even worse because the particles can scatter light more effectively.\nMotorists who are unable to avoid driving during the New Year celebrations must take extra precautions to stay safe including lowering speeds. The Highway Code also states that motorists must use headlights when visibility is seriously reduced, and that they can use front or rear fog lights until it improves.\nOther tips for driving in low-visibility conditions include braking slower to give drivers behind more time to slow down and listening for other vehicles before changing lanes. Tim Alcock from\nLeaseCar.uk said: “Many motorists will be shocked to find out that fireworks can dramatically cut visibility on the roads.\n“Although firework displays can be distracting, the majority of drivers know the importance of keeping their eyes on the road. However, it is not common knowledge that fireworks can affect air quality which has visibility-reducing consequences which are dangerous for all road users.\n“On average, fireworks displays cut visibility by a quarter, but in some parts of the UK, it has been recorded at over 60 per cent. This is a real concern for motorists heading out over the New Year period, and for the days after, because their chances of getting involved in a car crash are increased.\n“It is important that motorists alter their driving style if they know firework displays are on because there is evidence to suggest it will lower visibility, even if you don’t see a difference.\n“Use headlights, reduce speeds and brake slower on the day, and the days that follow a big display, to avoid getting into an accident.”",
