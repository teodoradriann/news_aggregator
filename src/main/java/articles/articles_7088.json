    "text": "CARNATION, Wash. — In response to the deadly flash floods in Texas, King County leaders are taking proactive measures to prevent a similar disaster.\nThe King County Flood Control District Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a motion to enhance flood preparedness and community awareness.\nThis is my worst fear for this community to have flooding like this,\" said King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn. \"To make sure we’re doing everything we can to make sure if something like this were to happen here, that we are the best prepared to handle it.\nRELATED: Texas officials defend quick response to flooding as number of missing hits triple-digits\nThe approved motion calls for a review of the county’s early warning systems, increased community outreach, and the distribution of flood preparedness videos and updated brochures in multiple languages. The initiative aims to improve flood risk reduction and expand educational efforts.\nJulia Moreno, a lifelong resident of Carnation, emphasized the importance of preparedness.\n\"Roads will close, we’ll have to find a new route from work and school, and home, and it's just something you learn to live with, is the flooding,\" Moreno said. \"There could be more preparedness for sure.\"\nRussell Hartwig, another Carnation resident, expressed appreciation for the county's efforts.\nALSO SEE: Texas flooding: 161 people missing in Kerr County as state death toll rises above 100\n\"I appreciate all the effort the county has put in for flood awareness and flood mitigation, and they’ve done quite a bit of both here,\" said Hartwig.\nKing County has faced 29 federally declared flood disasters since 1956, with smaller events occurring nearly every year. Officials stress that the focus is on preparedness, not panic.\nOur hearts are with the residents of the Texas Hill Country as they grieve the lives lost and begin the long road to recovery,\" Dunn said. \"Their tragedy is a sobering reminder of the importance of preparedness.\nFor more information on King County’s flood safety programs, click here.",

    "title": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor Calls Out Catch-22 In Trump's Immunity Argument",
    "text": "HuffPost Justice Sonia Sotomayor Calls Out Catch-22 In Trump's Immunity Argument Igor Bobic 26 April 2024 at 12:21 am · 3-\nSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor identified a key contradiction underlying former President Donald Trump ’s defense at Thursday’s Supreme Court hearing on whether he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\nThe discrepancy lies in Trump’s legal team arguing that presidents can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” committed while in office unless they are both impeached and convicted by the U.S. Congress.\nFor example, even if a president ordered a military coup or sold nuclear secrets to a foreign power — two hypotheticals posed by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan during the hearing — Trump couldn’t be held criminally liable without an act of Congress, his attorney, John Sauer, argued.\nFurthermore, Trump’s legal team said that there needs to be a “clear statement” in the statute covering such acts that directly apply to the president. Otherwise, their liability would be moot.\nBut the liberal justices on the court, including Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, pushed back against that line of reasoning aggressively. They noted that it essentially created a Catch-22 by preventing a president from being impeached at all.\n“If we say a president can’t be included in a criminal law unless explicitly named, then that would bar the Senate from convicting him for high crimes or misdemeanors because that means that he’s not subject to the law at all,” Sotomayor said.\n“If he’s not covered by the criminal law, he can’t be impeached for violating it at all,” she added.\nJackson also said the legal team’s argument “seems completely tautological to me.”\n“For us to hold that presidents cannot be prosecuted under any criminal statute without a clear statement from Congress to avoid the question of whether or not the Constitution allows them to be prosecuted, we’d have to have a reason,” she said.\nImpeachment doesn’t necessarily require criminal behavior to take place, but Trump’s legal team argued during his January 2020 impeachment trial that only a charged crime can be grounds for impeachment.\nThe 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, meanwhile, seemed poised to sidestep having to rule on Trump’s claims for absolute immunity by remanding the case to a lower appeals court for additional hearings. They suggested that the court needed more information to determine what is or isn’t an “official act” carried out by a president. Trump’s team has said that his actions in seeking to submit alternate slates of electors were official acts.\n“What concerns me is the court of appeals did not get into focused consideration about what acts we’re talking about,” Supreme Court Justice John Roberts said.\nA further delay in the proceeding would likely mean that the Department of Justice case against Trump for his unprecedented efforts to overturn an election he lost won’t be heard in court until after the November 2024 presidential election, if at all.\nDemocrats reacted to the hearing on Thursday with dismay, slamming the Supreme Court for dragging their feet.\n“He’s obviously not immune,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “SCOTUS is only protecting Trump and slowing his trial. SCOTUS should not have taken this case or frozen the district court. SCOTUS speeds up trials when it wants—but not in this case.”\nRelated...

    "text": "(The Shopping List)\nThese Cozy Hats Are My Ultimate Winter Weather Accessory\nDon’t sleep on these styles.\nDespite being an October baby, winter has become my favorite season. Don’t get me wrong, I still like fall. The\nvampy makeup, knee boots, and earthy colors are always welcomed come September. But with prolonged summer seasons becoming more the norm, I’m beginning to appreciate the coldest months of the year. The main reason? The fashion, of course. While I enjoy changing up my outerwear looks, it’s the cozy accessories that I’ve come to love most. And at the top of my list are comfy winter hats. No matter what coat I decide on, I’ve found that having a couple of head covers to play with keeps things interesting.\nTo be fair, I love a good hat regardless of the time of year. But the options for winter just hit differently. Beanies, for example, are one of my go-to cold-weather staples. Yes, they keep my head and ears toasty, but they also come in a\nrainbow of colors that instantly brighten any look. Caps of all sorts are another of my seasonal go-to’s. A sporty, wool five-panel never fails me, whether I’m pairing it with a car coat or cropped puffer. Sailer, cabbie, and newsboy styles are also well-beloved and have become a favorite for denim outfits with sweaters and nubby scarves.\nOver the years, I’ve grown my collection winter hats and look forward to digging through them all when the weather finally permits. Still, I’m always keeping an eye out for something new. Below are a few of the hat options that are currently on my radar.\nGrace Eleyae Everyday Beanie$44I love beanies but they aren’t too kind to my hair. The wooly material can cause breakage, and during a season when I feel my hair is at its most vulnerable, that’s the last thing I need. Enter this satin-lined option. It protects my hair and is Black woman-owned — a winning combo in my book. Free PeopleOver My Ribbed Balaclava$48To be honest, I’m still getting into balaclavas. But this bubblegum knit from Free People has me ready to dive in head first. The looser fit is reminiscent of a scarf, lightly wrapped around the head, and the shoestring-like ties remind me of a cozy hoodie. I can easily see myself pairing it with everything from a bubble coat to fur. Câbleami Boa Aviator Hat In Olive$155There’s something so cool about this trapper hat — the earthy color, the fuzzy ear flaps, and the rustic suede string that keeps them tightly secured. While I can almost guarantee I’d wear it as is, it’s nice to have the option to drop the flaps for some extra warmth.",
