    "title": "Asian Markets Trade Mostly Higher",
    "text": "Asian stock markets are trading mostly higher on Friday, despite the broadly negative cues from Wall Street overnight, as data showing the bigger-than-expected increase in US consumer prices further offset optimism the US Fed will continue to aggressively lower interest rates in the coming months. China is also falling as the markets await potential fiscal stimulus announcements on Saturday. Asian markets ended mostly higher on Thursday. Following the data, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told the Wall Street Journal he was \"definitely open\" to leaving interest rates unchanged in November.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 is falling to near the 8,200 level, with weakness in iron ore miners and financial stocks partially offset by gains in gold miners, technology and energy stocks amid spike in crude oil and bullion prices. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index is losing 10.60 points or 0.13 percent to 8,212.40, after hitting a low of 8,200.00 earlier.

In the currency market, the Aussie dollar is trading at $0.674 on Friday. Extending the gains in the previous two sessions, the Japanese stock market is notably higher on Friday, despite the broadly negative cues from Wall Street overnight. The benchmark Nikkei 225 is moving above the 39,600 level, with gains across most sectors led by index heavyweights and financial stocks. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index closed the morning session at 39,612.82, up 231.93 points or 0.59 percent, after touching a high of 39,662.42 earlier. Japanese stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday. Market heavyweight SoftBank Group is losing almost 1 percent, while Uniqlo operator Fast Retailing is gaining more than 3 percent.

In economic news, the M2 money stock in Japan was up 1.3 percent on year in September, the Bank of Japan said on Friday - coming in at 1,252.0 trillion yen. That was unchanged from the August reading, although shy of forecasts for 1.5 percent. On a monthly basis, M2 was up 1.0 percent - accelerating from 0.6 percent in the previous month. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar is trading in the higher 148 yen-range on Friday. Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan is up 1.2 percent, while New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Indonesia are higher by between 0.1 and 0.6 percent each. China and Malaysia are down 1.5 and 0.2 percent, respectively. Hong Kong is closed for the Double Ninth Festival. On Wall Street, stocks saw modest weakness during trading on Thursday after turning in a strong performance in the previous session. The major averages all gave back ground, with the Dow and the S&P 500 pulling back off yesterday's record closing highs. The major averages moved to the upside going into the close of trading but remained in the red. The Dow slipped 57.88 points or 0.1 percent to 42,454.12, the Nasdaq edged down 9.57 points or 0.1 percent to 18,282.05 and the S&P 500 dipped 11.99 points or 0.2 percent to 5,780.05.

While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged down by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both dipped by 0.2 percent. Crude oil prices rose sharply on Thursday as worries about escalating tensions in the Middle East outweighed uncertainty about the outlook for demand. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for November ended higher by $2.61 or about 3.56 percent at $75.85 a barrel. For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com Business News October 04, 2024 15:01 ET Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech was the highlight of the week that saw tensions in the MiddleEast escalate causing concerns for markets as well as for policymakers.

    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main) Sha'Carri Richardson prend sa revanche sur Julien Alfred à Zurich La pluie en début de soirée puis le froid ont sapé jeudi soir les espoirs de grands records lors du meeting de Zurich, quand même marqué par des duels de haute volée en sprint et les victoires de Sha'Carri Richardson et de Letsile Tebogo. Sur la piste détrempée du stade du Letzigrund, la flamboyante sprinteuse américaine, 2e du 100 m aux JO de Paris, s'est offert une petite revanche en battant la championne olympique Julien Alfred, pour sa première course depuis les Jeux. En tête tout au long de la course, Alfred s'est fait souffler la victoire sur la ligne grâce à un retour canon de Richardson, flashée en 10 sec 84 (10,88 pour Alfred). « Pour moi c'était une course formidable », a brièvement réagi Richardson après avoir célébré sa victoire. À Paris le mois dernier, Richardson - la plus rapide sur la ligne droite cette saison (10,71) - était favorite pour décrocher l'or olympique mais avait dû se contenter de l'argent, largement battue par Alfred qui avait apporté la première médaille olympique de l'histoire de son pays Sainte-Lucie. Le 200 m masculin offrait aussi un duel entre les deux premiers des JO, le Botswanais Letsile Tebogo et l'Américain Kenny Bednarek. Mais sans revanche puisque Tebogo a continué sa série de victoires de prestige en coupant la ligne en 19 sec 55, deux centièmes plus vite que Bednarek. Duplantis sous les six mètres La soirée n'a pas été marquée par de grosses performances, même si les champions olympiques présents (Mahuchikh à la hauteur, Crouser au poids, Holloway sur 110 m haies...) ont souvent tenu leur rang. Le public suisse espérait un nouveau record du monde du côté de la perche avec Mondo Duplantis, mais le Suédois, pas aidé par la météo et fatigué après son improbable 100 m la veille, s'est arrêté à 5,82 m. « Mon corps était brisé après la course d'hier et il faisait froid », a expliqué Duplantis, quand même vainqueur du concours même si c'est la première fois de l'été qu'il ne passe pas six mètres (hors qualifications) Mercredi, le recordman du monde suédois (6,26 m) avait remporté un 100 m exhibition face au recordman du monde du 400 m haies, le Norvégien Karsten Warholm, un défi que les deux amis s'étaient lancé l'année dernière. Le Suédois a gagné (10,37) et en guise de gage, le Norvégien a dû effectuer un « Walk of Shame » sur la piste avec un maillot suédois sur les épaules. Chebet et Ingebrigtsen ratent les records En demi-fond, la double championne olympique kényane Beatrice Chebet (5.000 m, 10.000 m) visait à Zurich le record du monde du 5.000 m (14:00.21). Aidée jusqu'à la mi-course par une lièvre, elle a ensuite tenté de s'accrocher aux lumières de la « wavelight » en bord de piste mais elle a progressivement lâché le rythme pour finir en 14 min 09 sec 52. « La météo n'était pas bonne pour une record du monde, a réagi Chebet. Je l'ai manqué et je pense que c'est à cause des conditions, et ma lièvre a lâché plus tôt que prévu. » Sur 1500 m hommes, la \"wavelight\" indiquait également l'allure du record du monde mais là encore, personne n'a réussi à la suivre. La course ressemblait pourtant à une grande explication entre les médaillés olympiques - l'Américain Cole Hocker, le Britannique Josh Kerr et Yared Nuguse - et le 4e Jakob Ingebrigtsen, éjecté du podium à Paris où il était pourtant favori. Ingebrigtsen, malade la semaine dernière après avoir battu le record du monde du 3 000 m, a suivi dans un premier temps l'allure du record (3:26.00) mais a finalement lâché et s'est fait doubler dans les derniers mètres par Yuguse, vainqueur en 3 min 29 sec 21 (3:29.52 pour Ingebrigtsen).",
