Notably, these batteries are the bread and butter for Tesla as they are used in some of the company's electric vehicles, such as the Cybertruck. However, Robin Zeng, the founder of the world's biggest EV battery company, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), [told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-battery-giant-catl-would-build-us-plant-if-trump-allows-it-2024-11-13/) that Musk's big bet on 4680 cylindrical cell technology \"is going to fail and never be successful.\"\nCATL batteries are used in some Tesla vehicles and are also used in other branded EVs such as Ford and Mustang. However, the company specializes in a different type of battery technology called lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP), which can't provide as much as the cylindrical cell units. Zeng also spoke about meeting with Musk and discussing batteries, to which he said he wasn't impressed with the CEO's knowledge on the subject. Zeng did acknowledge that he was impressed with Musk's knowledge on chips, software, hardware, and \"mechanical things\".",

    "title": "How Often Should You Do Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy?",
    "text": "How Often Should You Do Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy? Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has gained traction for its promising health benefits. Many people turn to HBOT for enhanced healing, improved energy levels, and recovery support for various conditions. However, one of the most common questions is: How often should you undergo this therapy? The answer depends on a few key factors, including your specific health needs, goals, and medical guidance. Let’s explore these considerations and uncover how frequently you should plan your HBOT sessions. Understanding Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment where you breathe pure oxygen inside a pressurized chamber, called a [hyperbaric chamber](https://oxygen8america.com/hyperbaric-chambers/). The added pressure helps more oxygen dissolve into your blood and tissues. This boost promotes cell repair, helps combat bacteria, and speeds up healing. HBOT is popular among those seeking wellness benefits, athletes recovering from injuries, and individuals dealing with chronic conditions like diabetes, brain injuries, and infections. Its applications vary widely, and so does the recommended frequency of treatments. Key Factors that Influence Frequency of HBOT The right frequency of HBOT sessions isn’t one-size-fits-all. Here’s what affects how often you should consider HBOT: - Your Health Condition: Certain conditions, like severe infections, may require more intensive treatment. Meanwhile, for wellness and general recovery, fewer sessions may suffice. - Therapy Goals: Whether you’re seeking quick recovery, enhanced performance, or long-term health benefits can influence session frequency. - Doctor’s Recommendation: Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. They will assess your needs and advise accordingly. Let’s break down recommended schedules based on common uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Recommended HBOT Frequency for Different Purposes 1. For Chronic Health Conditions If you’re managing a chronic condition like diabetes, non-healing wounds, or radiation injuries, HBOT can be an effective part of your treatment plan. Typically, for chronic conditions, more sessions are recommended: - Frequency: 3 to 5 times a week - Duration: 1–2 hours per session - Total Course: Often 20 to 40 sessions or more, depending on the severity Patients with these conditions may notice significant improvement with consistent treatments. The high frequency is designed to help your body utilize oxygen for healing and cell repair more effectively. 2. For Injury Recovery and Post-Surgery Healing Athletes, or anyone recovering from surgery, may benefit from HBOT to speed up healing and reduce inflammation. By increasing oxygen levels in the body, HBOT supports cell recovery and promotes faster healing times. - Frequency: 3 times a week - Duration: About 1 hour per session - Total Course: 10 to 20 sessions, based on progress Many athletes or post-surgical patients experience faster recovery times and reduced pain with HBOT. Consistent sessions over a short period allow for concentrated benefits without prolonged breaks. 3. For Wellness and Preventative Care Some people use HBOT as a preventative measure or for general wellness. The aim here is to boost energy levels, support immunity, and maintain overall health. - Frequency: 1 to 2 times a week - Duration: 1-hour sessions - Total Course: Ongoing as desired, but usually around 10 to 15 sessions initially In this context, HBOT can be seen as a wellness “booster.” Weekly sessions maintain a steady increase in oxygen levels, which may enhance mood, focus, and energy. After the initial set of sessions, many people choose to continue once or twice a month. 4. For Brain Health and Cognitive Benefits Emerging research suggests that HBOT may have benefits for brain health. Conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cognitive decline related to aging may benefit from regular sessions. - Frequency: 3 to 4 times a week - Duration: 1–1.5 hours per session - Total Course: 30–40 sessions, depending on improvement HBOT’s potential to support neuroplasticity, increase blood flow to the brain, and reduce inflammation makes it an appealing option. If you’re pursuing HBOT for cognitive health, close monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential to track progress. What to Expect During Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Sessions Each session begins with you entering a sealed hyperbaric chamber, either soft-sided or hard. The chamber pressurizes gradually, reaching a level above standard atmospheric pressure. You’ll then breathe 100% oxygen. Most sessions last about 1 to 1.5 hours, although times may vary based on the treatment purpose. During the session, some people read, listen to music, or rest. The pressurization might cause a slight popping sensation in your ears, similar to the feeling during a plane ascent. How to Know if You’re Overdoing HBOT While hyperbaric therapy is generally safe, there’s a limit to how much oxygen your body can safely absorb over time. Overdoing HBOT can lead to side effects such as oxygen toxicity, ear discomfort, or fatigue. If you experience any of the following symptoms, it might be a sign to reduce frequency or pause treatment: - Dizziness or nausea - Shortness of breath - Blurred vision or ringing in the ears - Extreme fatigue Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help prevent these effects. They can also adjust your frequency based on your body’s response. Finding the Right Balance The key to HBOT’s effectiveness lies in consistency, not overuse. By finding the right balance, you can maximize benefits while minimizing risks. Here are a few tips to ensure you’re on the right track: - Start with a Consultation: Before beginning HBOT, consult with a licensed provider. They will recommend a plan based on your health and goals. - Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how you feel after each session. Minor fatigue is normal, but persistent discomfort should be discussed with your provider. - Adjust as Needed: Over time, your frequency might change. Regular check-ins with your healthcare team ensure you’re not overloading your system with oxygen. Summing Up Hyperbaric oxygen therapy offers a versatile approach to healing, wellness, and recovery. The right frequency for [hyperbaric oxygen therapy](https://oxygen8america.com/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/) depends on your individual needs, health conditions, and goals. While some conditions benefit from frequent sessions, others require only occasional maintenance. Finding your ideal HBOT schedule may take time, but with guidance from healthcare providers and by listening to your body, you can determine a routine that enhances your health without overdoing it. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, when used thoughtfully, can become a powerful part of your wellness toolkit.",

    "text": "HOMINY, Okla. — The May 6, EF-4 tornado began on the outskirts of the city of Hominy, which did not experience much damage but did go days without power — and still does not have drinkable water. The city issued a boil water notice May 5, after its water supply from Hominy Municipal Lake tested positive for [E. coli,](https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/index.html) but the Oklahoma [Department of Environmental Quality](https://www.deq.ok.gov/divisions/wqd/) couldn't get investigators to check its testing systems until Thursday because the plant was also without power the first half of the week. The city announced Thursday afternoon the boil water notice will continue through at least the weekend as it follows guidance from DEQ. In the meantime, Hominy Fire & Rescue has collected crates of water bottles and water buffaloes with help from American Legion Post 142 for anyone who needs them. In the first day and a half, volunteers said the number of residents to come by numbered in the hundreds. \"That's what we do. We take care of our communities,\" John Hamilton of Post 142 in Hominy said. \"We help where there's a need. We fill that need, or try to.\" Residents receiving the emergency bottles like Deborah Martin and Maria Sivils told 2 News there was never a time they didn't trust the water until now. They also only regained electricity Wednesday night. \"It was terrifying really. You just see nothing but blackness,\" Sivils said. \"We're managing. We are adapting. It's just part of the situation, you can't do anything about it,\" Martin said. Previous coverage >>> [BOIL ORDER: E. coli in Hominy water causing disruptions](https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/boil-order-e-coli-in-hominy-water-causing-disruptions) The contamination continues to disrupt daily life in town, residents said. Hominy Public Schools moved to distance learning temporarily due to the dirty water and storm damage, but its superintendent said Thursday the district will tough out for the final weeks of the semester. After all, it could be worse. \"We're getting by. We're going to do it. At least we're not as bad as Barnsdall,\" Sivils said. \"We are blessed we didn't get hit like poor Barnsdall,\" Martin added.
