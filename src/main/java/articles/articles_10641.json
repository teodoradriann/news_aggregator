    "text": "The effort began after Bronxville resident Shana Kesel Sabatini was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer in September 2023.\nSince then, Sabatini, a well-known daughter, friend, and mother to two young children, 13-year-old Isabella and 8-year-old Dominic, has bravely battled the disease, according to her friend Jenna Brunelli, who began\na GoFundMe page to collect donations for the family.\n\"As expected by all who know her, she has put up a brave and truly remarkable fight against this unrelenting and devastating disease,\" Brunelli wrote. However, the battle may be over soon, as Sabatini has been brought home under the care of hospice.\n\"Though her fight is coming to an end, there is still much that can be done to honor her beautiful soul,\" Brunelli wrote on the fundraiser page, continuing that Sabatini's last wish is for her children to have enough financial means to pursue their future without having to worry.\nAll funds collected by the page will go toward the Sabatini family for this purpose. As of Thursday, April 18, the fundraiser had collected a whopping $70,700 out of an $80,000 goal.\nThose who wish to donate to the GoFundMe page can do so by clicking here.\n\"Let's shower this family with love and light,\" Brunelli said.\nSabatini's friend Baret Upham also urged community members to consider donating to the family in a Facebook post: \"Sometimes life just isn't fair and some of the best are taken from us too soon. Shana is an amazing person, friend, wife, and mother. Please consider donating to her legacy.\"\nThe fundraiser garnered several words of support from those who contributed.\n\"No words can express the sadness I feel for you and your family...\" commented Nicole K.\nKristy A. also reached out to the family: \"Sending our love and prayers!\"\n ",

    "text": "Sunday World Newsletter\nSign up for the latest news and updates\nKaren’s Diner only opened its first outlet in Ireland on Dublin’s O’Connell Street in February of last year\nThe operator of Karen’s Diner in Dublin - where as part of the concept staff are supposed to be obnoxious to customers - has been ordered to pay over €1,000 in compensation to an ex-worker in a row over unpaid tips.\nKaren’s Diner only opened its first outlet in Ireland on Dublin’s O’Connell Street in February of last year and the themed restaurant centres on purposely offensive staff.\nIt comes from the use of the name ‘Karen’ as shorthand for the stereotype of an entitled, middle-aged, white woman who prides herself on asking to speak to the manager.\nThe international chain only opened in Australia in 2021 and quickly became a TikTok sensation.\nMaria Wilkinson started working at Karen's Diner here last year and after finishing up on April 19, 2024, she lodged a complaint with the Workplace Relations Commissions (WRC) over unpaid tips in October.\nMs Wilkinson told the WRC at a hearing on March 5 that when she started to work at Karen’s Diner she was told that she and her colleagues would be paid the service charge received from the customers, to be divided between all employees.\nHowever, she stated that at no stage did she ever receive any share of the service charge. At first, she understood it would be nearly €2,000 each and then it changed to nearly €1,000 so she was not sure how much exactly is owed.\nNo one from her employer, Dining Experience Ltd trading as Karen’s Diner, appeared at the WRC hearing to rebut Ms Wilkinson’s allegations over the unpaid tips.\nIn his findings, WRC adjudicator Pat Brady ordered Dining Experience Ltd to pay Ms Wilkinson four weeks’ wages, or €1,018.40, for the breach of the Payment of Wages Act concerning the unpaid tips.\nIn his findings, Mr Brady stated that he was satisfied that there was an agreement between Dining Experience Ltd and Ms Wilkinson, and her colleagues, that tips would be distributed, and this was clearly not honoured.\nHe said that while it is not clear what became of any tips collected by the employer, Section 4B (2) of the Act makes it clear that an employer “may not retain any share of tips or gratuities received” subject to a number of exceptions.\nMr Brady stated that it was clear from Ms Wilkinson's evidence that significant tips were being generated as she was told that she might expect payments initially around €2,000 and later around €1,000.\nHe said: “Whatever became of the tips is not clear except to the extent that neither the complainant nor her co-workers received any of them.”\nMr Brady stated that Ms Wilkinson was paid €12.73 per hour for a 20-hour week, or €254.60 per week.\nHe said: “For the breach of her rights under the Act, I award her four weeks wages in the amount of €1018.40.”\nMr Brady pointed out that from December 1, 2022, the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Act 2022 introduced new rules as to how employers have to share tips, gratuities and service charges generated electronically amongst employees.",

    "title": "Confederate statues in Florida could be off limits if lawmakers pass this bill",
    "text": "Confederate monuments have come down in Orlando, Tampa and most recently Jacksonville as part of a nationwide reckoning with public memorials that commemorate the Confederacy.\nBut if a bill becomes law next year, local leaders could be fined and even booted from office if they remove those monuments.\nState Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville, is pushing the measure to protect monuments, including memorials to the Confederacy, and punish local officials who remove them. He said his bill is retroactive and seeks to restore monuments removed by local governments after Jan. 1, 2017.\n“It is history, and history belongs to all Floridians,” Black said. “We have started tearing down statues and memorials for all sorts of things. This is cancel culture. What we are trying to do is right the wrongs of cancel culture as they have been expressed against our public art.”\nBut state Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville, said Confederate memorials were erected to “scare and intimidate the Black community post-slavery,” and local elected leaders and their constituents should decide whether the monuments remain standing.\n“It is a horrible bill,” Nixon said. “It is meant to throw red meat at a base of voters at a time when they know it is an election year.”\nNixon added about the Confederate memorials: “We should not be uplifting losers who wanted to keep my people enslaved.”\nThe proposal ( HB 395 ), filed in November, prohibits local governments from removing monuments or memorials. Violators would be fined $5,000 or the cost of replacing the monument, whichever is higher. Elected officials who defy the state law could be removed from office by the governor.\nContextual plaques could be added if the director of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, state historic preservation officer and the Florida Historical Commission decide they provide “a more accurate understanding of the monument or memorial.” Monuments could also be temporarily moved for construction but must be returned to their original location or “as close as possible to the original location in a prominent place.”\n“It is the intent of the Legislature that the state not allow a historical monument or memorial to be removed, damaged, or destroyed,” the bill states. “Accurate history belongs to all Floridians in perpetuity.”\nThe bill doesn’t specifically reference the Confederacy, but it protects memorials for “any armed conflict since settlers from other countries came to what is now the United States.”\nAfter years of debate, Jacksonville Democratic Mayor Donna Deegan ordered the removal of the “Tribute to the Women of the Southern Confederacy” monument, which had stood in the city’s Springfield Park since 1915. Crews took down the memorial early Wednesday.\n“Symbols matter. They tell the world what we stand for and what we aspire to be,” Deegan said in a statement. “By removing the confederate monument from Springfield Park, we signal a belief in our shared humanity.”\nGet insights into Florida politics Subscribe to our free Buzz newsletter\nWe’ll send you a rundown on local, state and national politics coverage every Thursday.

The 9-ton monument topped with a concrete solider known as “Johnny Reb” was erected in 1911 on Main Street — now Magnolia Avenue — before being moved in 1917 to the park.\nElsewhere in Florida, Confederate memorials in Gainesville and Tampa were moved from courthouse grounds to cemeteries. In 2020, former Republican Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry ordered the removal of a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier that stood for more than a century in the city’s downtown.\nThe Florida Legislature has also voted in recent years to remove symbols of the state’s Confederate past. In 2015, the Senate agreed to strip the Confederate battle flag from its seal. Lawmakers voted to replace a statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall with one of civil rights Mary McLeod Bethune.\nBethune’s statue was unveiled in 2022, making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in Statutory Hall. Every state is represented by two statues.\nBlack’s bill includes a provision requiring state authorities to make the statue of Kirby Smith available first to Bob Grenier for free to display in Lake County. Grenier, former volunteer curator of the Lake County Historical Museum, pushed a plan to put the relic on display in the first-floor museum of the Historic Courthouse in Tavares.\nIf a suitable site in Lake County isn’t found by July 1, 2025, the state would find an alternative location to display the statue for free, according to the bill. The Confederate commander was born in St. Augustine, but otherwise spent little time in the state.\nGov. Ron DeSantis has been mum on whether he would sign the bill protecting monuments. In November, he told reporters he wasn’t familiar with the measure and would need to review it. A similar bill failed to gain traction in the 2023 legislative session.\nThe removal of the Jacksonville monument wasn’t the only time this week that the Civil War made headlines 158 years after the fact. DeSantis’ presidential campaign was sharply critical of his GOP opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, for not mentioning slavery when asked Thursday about the cause of the war.\nAs of January 2022, Florida had 77 Confederate memorials, according to The Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Whose Heritage?” project. Thirty-three have been removed since 1880, according to the report.\nLawmakers will start their 60-day legislative session on Jan. 9.",

Para ello, han sometido muestras de esperma humano a condiciones de microgravedad utilizando un vuelo parabólico, es decir, un cometa del vómito. Los resultados obtenidos no han sido precisamente positivos. En el experimento participaron quince voluntarios cuyos [espermatozoides](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2024-07-18/elon-musk-marte-colonizar-espacio-semen-fertilidad_3925782/) se dividieron en dos grupos. Uno fue expuesto a los cambios gravitatorios durante el vuelo parabólico, mientras que el otro permaneció como grupo de control en tierra. Los investigadores analizaron las muestras antes y después del vuelo, observando que los cambios gravitatorios redujeron de forma significativa la motilidad y la vitalidad de las células espermáticas. El impacto de la gravedad en la reproducción El análisis demostró que incluso breves exposiciones a la microgravedad, como las experimentadas en estos vuelos, pueden comprometer la calidad del esperma humano. Aunque las razones exactas detrás de este fenómeno siguen siendo desconocidas, los científicos alertan de que misiones más largas, como las dirigidas a [Marte](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2024-11-04/elon-musk-nuevos-planes-marte-proyecto-mas-ambicioso-1qrt_3996890/) o la [Luna](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/novaceno/2022-11-16/nasa-artemis-ii-futuro-mision_3484467/), podrían intensificar estos efectos.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nTeleVox, the industry-leading provider of omnichannel patient relationship management technology, will display its platform designed to help healthcare providers move from simple, episodic patient interactions to more comprehensive and meaningful relationships at ViVE 2024 (booth 1730), held February 25-28 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.\nViVE attendees will get a firsthand look at\nTeleVox’s Enterprise Edition, which redefines patient engagement, turning episodic interactions into continuous, evolving relationships. Leveraging SMART SMS, this omnichannel solution enhances patient experiences, optimizes care, lightens the staff workload, and contributes to the financial success of health systems.\n“The transition towards patient relationship management (PRM) is essential as we navigate the shift to value-based care in the face of escalating healthcare costs,” said Vik Krishnan, President of TeleVox. “We look forward to showing ViVE attendees why PRM is instrumental in enhancing patient communication and health outcomes, significantly optimizing healthcare service delivery and accruing substantial operational and financial benefits for healthcare systems.”\nTraditional healthcare engagement models often silo patient interactions, leading to fragmented communication efforts. Call centers, EHR, CRM, and other digital health applications all communicate with patients in different channels. TeleVox’s Enterprise Edition unifies disparate communication channels into a cohesive ecosystem with the patient relationship at its core.\nAdditionally, unlike EHR-driven episodic communications that typically only target existing patients through web and mobile channels, Enterprise Edition champions omnichannel communication to engage both existing and prospective patients.\nAt TeleVox’s ViVE booth, attendees can also explore Practice Edition. This variant is purpose-built to meet the unique needs of physician practices. Practice Edition addresses common industry challenges – such as inefficient scheduling, lack of automated and scalable communications, patient retention, and reputation management – further highlighting TeleVox’s dedication to redefining healthcare communication through advanced technologies like SMART SMS.\nAbout TeleVox\nTeleVox is a leading provider of omnichannel digital patient relationship management technology. Our solutions are used by more than 7,000 healthcare organizations—from hospitals and health systems to community health centers—to engage, educate, and empower patients throughout their care journey. Our patient relationship management platform integrates with the electronic health record (EHR) to support automated, personalized, two-way interactions with patients. And our pharmaceutical team partners with life science companies to develop strategic disease state awareness, education, and vaccination reminders by reaching more patients through customized communication.
