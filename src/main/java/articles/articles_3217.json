    "text": "Home policy Status: 22.08.2024, 21:27\nFrom: Erkan Pehlivan\nPress Split\nUkraine has attacked an air force base in Russia. Videos show a fireball and smoke rising.\nKursk – For weeks, Ukraine has been increasingly attacking targets in Russia. Ukrainian air strikes have been reported from western Russian regions – including in the Volgograd region, where a Defense Ministry facility caught fire. However, the fire has been extinguished, regional governor Andrei Bocharov said on the Telegram online channel without giving any more details about the location.\nAs the news agency AFP According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, the target of the attack was a Russian air force base in Marinovka, more than 300 kilometers from the border.\nFireball and explosion at Russian air base Footage circulating on social media shows a fireball erupting over a Russian air base. Tactical and strategic bombers, including Su-24 fighter jets, are said to have been stationed at the Marinovka air base. According to Newsweek The town is said to have been attacked with drones. Explosions can be heard and thick smoke can be seen on video.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Air Force Chief Mykola Oleshchuk reported on the successful operations of his fighter jets during the offensive in the western Russian region of Kursk. Precision bombs were mainly used against Russian positions and troop concentrations.\nUkraine deploys fighter jets over Russia Even though Russian units have now started to integrate abandoned houses into their defense lines, they cannot escape the attacks. “We see everything, we know everything,” Oleshchuk wrote on the Telegram platform. “Our precision bombs will find you everywhere.”\nUkraine is increasingly attacking targets in Russia. © IMAGO/Chubotin Kirill Precision bombs are glide bombs that can be guided to their target by pilots remotely. During the advance in the Kursk region, two important bridges over the Sejm River were destroyed by fighter planes. Oleshchuk did not provide any information on which types of aircraft Ukraine used in its attacks. According to Ukrainian military experts, the American F-16 fighter planes provided by the West have not yet been used.\nUkraine wants to establish buffer zone on Russian soil There are good reasons why Ukraine is attacking Russian troops on its soil. “The creation of a buffer zone on the territory of the aggressor,” said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his evening video address. In view of the heavy fighting there and in eastern Ukraine, he asked Western partners for a rapid supply of weapons and ammunition. “War knows no holidays,” Zelensky said, addressing the USA, Great Britain and France in particular.\nThe Ukrainian soldiers are doing “excellent work,” said Zelensky. “But we need to speed up the supply from our partners, we are asking for that.” Ukraine needs solutions, and is especially dependent on the timely arrival of the promised aid packages.\nUkraine under pressure in the east Ukraine, on the other hand, is under pressure on its own territory. They have already had to withdraw from some places in the east of the country. The area around Toretsk in particular is “more than just defense for Ukraine, the main goal of our defense measures in general is now to destroy as much of Russia’s potential as possible, the potential for war, and to carry out a maximum of counterattack work,” stressed Zelensky.\nIn addition to Toretsk, Pokrovsk has also been a constant hotspot in recent weeks. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported heavy fighting around the towns. In Pokrovsk alone, 24 Russian assaults were registered during the day, some with the support of fighter planes. In Toretsk, a total of 15 Russian attacks were repelled. The information could not be independently verified. (erpe/dpa/AFP)\n#Ukraine #targets #base",

    "title": "Está no streaming, ganhou 2 Oscars e é um dos melhores filmes de guerra do século XXI: Uma impressionante exibição de cinema de guerra que inspirou vários videogames",
    "text": "Os catálogos das plataformas de streaming estão repletos de títulos que foram originalmente lançados nos cinemas. Na verdade, mais de uma vez eles ocupam as primeiras posições entre os mais assistidos nesses serviços, mas hoje quero chamar sua atenção para um que talvez tenha passado um pouco despercebido no catálogo Max. Estou falando de\n[Falcão Negro em Perigo](/filmes/filme-35144/), um dos melhores filmes de guerra do século XXI.\nVencedor de dois Oscars na época - levou para casa os prêmios de Melhor Som e Melhor Edição de Som - é um filme que não teve o impacto que merecia. E há três razões principais pelas quais Falcão Negro em Perigo talvez seja o filme de guerra mais importante deste milênio (posso pensar em vários outros melhores).\nO primeiro - e provavelmente o menos importante - é o incrível elenco que Scott conseguiu reunir aqui, pois é quase impossível listar o número de rostos conhecidos que aparecem no filme, embora vários deles não fossem muito conhecidos na época.\n[Josh Hartnett](/personalidades/personalidade-8766/), [Ewan McGregor](/personalidades/personalidade-17043/), [Orlando Bloom](/personalidades/personalidade-64908/), [Eric Bana](/personalidades/personalidade-61734/), [Jason Isaacs](/personalidades/personalidade-12219/), [Hugh Dancy](/personalidades/personalidade-66099/), [Tom Sizemore](/personalidades/personalidade-17396/), [William Fichtner](/personalidades/personalidade-19386/), [Nicolaj Coster-Waldau](/personalidades/personalidade-85775/) e [Jeremy Piven](/personalidades/personalidade-24378/), para citar apenas alguns.\nA segunda é que se trata de um título com uma enorme influência posterior, especialmente no mundo dos videogames. Por exemplo, no ano passado, nossos colegas do site espanhol Vidaextra destacaram sua importância no desenvolvimento do novo Delta Force, enquanto o latino-americano 3DJuegos comentou que ele foi uma das influências claras do Battlefield 3. Além disso, seu peso foi sentido em outros títulos, como Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare e Medal of Honor.\nPor último, mas não menos importante, Falcão Negro em Perigo é um ótimo filme, cheio de energia e com um impressionante trabalho de encenação de Scott. É verdade que, na época, houve alguma controvérsia sobre a maneira como o filme retratou a história real que ocorreu na Somália e que serviu de base para o filme, mas, por si só, é um trabalho incrivelmente envolvente que leva seus personagens ao limite tanto quanto o espectador.\nÉ claro que não é um filme para todos os gostos, pois a violência é muito explícita, mas não podemos nos esquecer de que as guerras são cenários sangrentos em que tudo de mais selvagem pode acontecer. Às vezes, isso é um pouco esquecido ou limitado ao foco em tragédias mais ou menos individuais, quando se trata de algo que pode afetar qualquer pessoa que esteja por perto.\n*Tradução de site parceiro do AdoroCinema\nFique por dentro das novidades dos filmes e séries e receba oportunidades exclusivas.\n[Ouça OdeioCinema no Spotify](/noticias/filmes/noticia-1000051206/) ou em sua plataforma de áudio favorita, [participe do nosso Canal no WhatsApp](/noticias/filmes/noticia-1000075152/) e seja um Adorer de Carteirinha!",

    "text": "California House Passes Bill Barring Schools From Informing Parents of Students’ Gender Identity\nThe bill passes after a heated Assembly hearing on Wednesday.\nA bill to prevent California school boards from requiring staff to notify parents if their child requests to use different pronouns passed the California Assembly Thursday after a heated debate over parental rights.\nThe bill passed 60-15 and will now go to California Governor Newsom for approval. Whether Mr. Newsom will choose to veto the bill or sign it into law, however, is uncertain.\nWhile the Democratic governor identifies as an LGBTQ ally, he previously vetoed legislation that would have required courts to consider parents’ acceptance of a transgender child’s gender identity in determining custody.\nThursday’s vote follows an emotional hearing on Wednesday, which drew hoards of opinionated opponents and supporters of the bill and incited screaming matches, prompting one supporter to be escorted from the chamber.\nThe legislation would bar districts from implementing what LGBTQ advocates describe as “forced outing” policies and protect employees who defy such policies from punishment.\nThe proposal follows Republican efforts to mandate parental notification policies in all California schools last year. Though the GOP bills never gained any traction in the Democrat-majority Assembly, individual school boards across the state began to implement their own notification policies.\nAssemblyman Chris Ward, a gay member of the Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, described the notification policies as having “torn apart the fabric” of California’s communities, adding that they “put teachers in a very awkward space.”\nMr. Ward warned that the policies can result in teachers “jumping ahead” of “an individual’s timeline” of when and where to go public with personal details, which he says “can do an incredible amount of harm.”\nThe president of one of the first school districts to implement such a notification policy last summer, Sonja Shaw, testified against the bill during the hearing.\nShe noted that the policies in place only require parental notification when students request to change their name or pronouns or to use facilities of the opposite sex. In such cases, Ms. Shaw argues, the child has already come out.\n“It’s really bizarre to me that you’re saying a child can come out to potentially thousands of their peers and hundreds of staff members, but not their parents,” she\ntold the Sacramento Bee ahead of the hearing.\nRepresentative Josh Hoover raised his concern that the bill is “encouraging parents to be kept in the dark.”\nA veteran teacher of 22 years and mother of a formerly transgender identifying son, Arienne Adamčíková, testified against the bill, saying that “teachers don’t want to be the gender police” nor do they want to be “liars” or “co-conspirators” in hiding information from parents.\n“Parents should be trusted to make decisions for their own kids,” she added.\nHer testimony evidently offended transgender activist Ebony Harper, prompting Ms. Harper to call out: “Y’all might as well have a racist up there, that is a gender critical monster.”\nMs. Harper was escorted from the hearing shortly thereafter.\nTensions continued to run high on Thursday morning, as Representative Corey Jackson tried to aggressively confront Representative Bill Essayli after he voiced concerns about the bill.",

    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Wednesday marked the beginning of Chanukah which runs through January 2nd.\nThe Chabad Jewish Center of South Dakota will host a public Menorah Lighting ceremony at the Alliance Sunday, December 29th at 3:30 pm.\n“This year we have a special addition to the Chanukah festivities, a giant seven-foot Menorah built by local children all out of Lego that is going to be something very exciting, you’re not going to want to miss seeing that, a Menorah built entirely out of Lego, we’re going to have Sioux Falls Fire & Rescue dropping from their ladder hundreds of Chanukah treats, gelt, all different dreidels and treats and things that the children love in honor of Chanukah, it’s a special addition by Sioux Falls Fire & Rescue, we did it last year and it was a hit and we’re happy to do it again this year,” said Rabbi Mendel Alperowitz.\nIn addition to the public Menorah lighting, Chabad Jewish Center has two Menorah displays in downtown Sioux Falls this year, one located outside the Wells Fargo Building on Phillips and 9th and another at The Plaza at the Federal Court Building on Phillips at 12th. These public Menorahs are part of Chabad Jewish Center’s mission to make the message of Chanukah accessible to everyone.\n“Chanukah began on Wednesday and it’s an eight-day holiday. Every night of the holiday we light an additional candle of the Menorah, the eight-branch candelabra, every night we light an additional candle to symbolize and remember that a little bit of light dispels a lot of darkness, that’s what Chanukah is all about, to take that message home and live with it the entire year,” said Rabbi Alperowitz.\nMore information about this weekend’s public Menorah lighting, as well as Chabad Jewish Center of South Dakota can be found here.\nCopyright 2024 Dakota News Now.
