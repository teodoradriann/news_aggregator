    "text": "Pintar los edificios de blanco contribuye a combatir el calor en las ciudades, un remedio conocido en el Mediterráneo desde hace siglos y que ahora podría empezar a aplicarse en ciudades como Londres, según un estudio publicado este jueves. La temperatura en una gran ciudad como Londres podría reducirse hasta 2º C si el uso del color blanco, o de materiales reflectantes, se generalizara, según este estudio publicado en Geophysical Research Letters. [ Lee También ](/noticia/tendencias/quien-noelia-pace-medium-llegara-chile-entradas-hasta-50-mil-pesos-4-7-2024) Quién es Noelia Pace, la médium que llegará a Chile con entradas desde los 28 mil pesos Los tejados pintados de blanco son mejores que los que utilizan vegetales, una moda arquitectónica que se generalizó en ciudades, o los paneles solares, según este estudio. \"Si se generalizaran en todo Londres\", esos tejados \"podrían reducir la temperatura exterior en la ciudad en una media de 1,2º C e incluso en 2º C en algunos lugares\", según este estudio, elaborado por científicos de la l'University College de Londres (UCL). Los paneles solares y la vegetalización solo permiten hacer bajar el termómetro en 0,3º C de media. El aire acondicionado, al transferir el aire caliente en el interior de los edificios al exterior, calentaría la ciudad en 0,15º C, si se generalizara ante la amenaza del cambio climático. En el centro de Londres la situación podría empeorar hasta 1º C, causando verdaderas \"islas de calor\", advierte el estudio. En los países de la cuenca mediterránea, encalar o pintar completamente de blanco las casas, desde la azotea hasta la fachada, es un método secular para combatir el calor. Otro estudio, realizado en marzo en un barrio de Singapur, constató que al pintar totalmente de blanco tejados, fachadas y calzadas, la temperatura podía bajar hasta en 2º C en la tarde, y que el confort térmico de los peatones mejoraba en hasta 1,5º C. Ello se debe al efecto albedo, es decir, que cuanto más clara es una superficie, más luz rebota, y con ello disminuye el calor, aunque aumenta notablemente el deslumbramiento.

    "title": "Detective testifies that defendant lied to Elyria police investigating 2022 Midview Crossing killing",
    "text": "ELYRIA — Confined to a hospital bed at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland in November 2022 and unable to speak due to his injuries, Henry Spooner lied to Elyria police detectives investigating his killing of another man at a Middle Avenue apartment complex 11 days earlier, one of those two detectives testified Wednesday. Spooner, 23, is charged in Lorain County Common Pleas Court with murder, felonious assault, having weapons under disability, tampering with evidence and improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle in the death of Jordan Flanigan, 24. Judge Giovanna Bremke is hearing the case. Flanigan was shot outside Building H at the Midview Crossing Apartments, 1864 Middle Ave., the night of Oct. 27, 2022. His death was a homicide caused by a single gunshot wound above his left eye that was fired from less than 2 feet away, Lorain County Coroner Dr. Frank Miller testified. Prosecutors allege Spooner executed Flanigan. Spooner's defense is that he shot and killed Flanigan in self-defense during an ambush. The whole incident was caught on motion-activated security cameras, jurors learned Wednesday. Seeing Flanigan killed, two of his friends returned fire with Flanigan's gun and another weapon. Spooner was hit twice including once each in the head and abdomen and driven to University Hospitals Elyria Medical Center before being taken to MetroHealth. Eleven days later he was in a hospital bed, being read his Miranda rights and willingly answering questions from detectives Zach Kasperovich and James Wise without an attorney. Most of Spooner's answers were lies based on evidence police already had, Wise testified Wednesday. Unable to speak with his jaw wired shut and a tracheostomy tube in his windpipe, Spooner wrote his answers on a piece of paper, according to a recording of the interview played in court by Assistant Lorain County Prosecutor Matt Kern. Spooner seemed awake, alert, oriented and able to answer detectives' questions, Wise testified. The jury, including 11 women and three men, watched Kern and Wise review Spooner's written statement line-by-line. A veteran detective with \"probably a hundred\" shooting investigations under his belt, Wise testified that Spooner lied when he claimed he didn't know who Flanigan was. Wise said Spooner lied about being an innocent bystander to the shooting when he could be seen, on video, shooting Flanigan. \"I was jus caught in the crossfire wrong place wrong time,\" Spooner wrote during the interview. Spooner lied when he said he wasn't carrying a gun that night, Wise testified, again pointing to surveillance video. \"I never pulled a gun on nobody WTF I was drinkin' w(ith) sum females,\" Spooner wrote. Spooner further lied about knowing who was shooting that night, according to detectives. \"I was drunk IDK,\" Spooner wrote, despite being one of three men police could prove pulled a trigger. He didn't know at the time Elyria police already had video evidence and didn't believe them when the detectives showed him, Wise said. The detectives at one point described exactly what Spooner did that night and how it was caught on video. He kept denying it. \"I never pulled a gun on no one,\" Spooner wrote. He added that instead, he was hanging out with \"some girls I was finna leave get some (sex) and then that (the shooting) happened.\" Just caught in the crossfire, the detectives asked him? \"Exactly only thing that was on my mind is which one of these hos I'm f---in',\" he wrote. Hearing the shots, Spooner wrote that he \"took off running\" and \"honestly can't even remember who brought me to the hospital, it happened so fast.\" Wise testified he refused to show Spooner the video, but Kasperovich showed Spooner low-quality screenshots of Spooner from the video. \"I told you, man. We're not playing games here,\" Kasperovich told Spooner. \"We're not here to trick you at all,\" Wise told Spooner. \"We're here to get your opinion on it, that's all.\" Spooner was honest when he said he was driving around that day \"just drinkin', normal youngin stuff.\" That was backed up by video evidence Leigh mentioned in her opening statement. On cross-examination by defense attorney R.J. Budway, he admitted he didn't know if Spooner was on painkillers or other medication at the time of the interview. As far as Flanigan's killing goes, \"I do not believe it's self-defense\" Wise testified. Four other men were charged with crimes related to the shooting. Harold Willis, now 22, tossed Spooner's handgun out of a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo while fleeing Elyria police, a Jeep that his cousin Demetrius Willis, now 23, crashed near Elyria High School. The two men pleaded guilty to felony charges in March and Bremke placed them on community control for three years. Through his attorney, Harold Willis said he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent if called to testify in Spooner's trial. Antwon President Jr., now 25, is serving 4½ years in prison after pleading guilty last year to having weapons under disability, tampering with evidence and aggravated assault, all felonies. His expected release date is in February 2029, according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. President's younger half brother, who was 15 at the time, shot Spooner in the head and nearly killed him after Flanigan's killing. Prosecutors said the teen acted in self-defense and he was only found delinquent of a misdemeanor in Lorain County Juvenile Court. His mother, Courtney Hollis, testified Wednesday that the teen was \"subpoenaed (to testify) but not served.\" She said she knew how to get in touch with him but not where he is currently living. Testimony resumes this morning. Reporter Carissa Woytach contributed to this story. Contact Dave O'Brien at (440) 329-7129 or dobrien@chroniclet.com.",

    "title": "7 tacky habits of middle class people who try to look wealthier than they actually are",
    "text": "Tension: The middle class often strives to signal wealth in ways that ironically reveal insecurity rather than success.\nNoise: Pop culture and influencer marketing fuel misguided ideas of what wealth looks like, distorting our understanding of genuine affluence.\nDirect Message : True wealth doesn’t need to be performed—it reveals itself quietly through confidence, ease, and freedom from the need to impress.\nTo learn more about our editorial approach, explore The Direct Message methodology .\nWhy trying to look rich can make you look the opposite I remember the first time I saw a car with Gucci seat covers. It was parked in a busy Tesco lot in East London, wedged between two standard hatchbacks. I couldn’t stop staring. Not because it looked luxurious—but because it didn’t. It looked desperate.\nIn my research into digital well-being and media narratives, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern: the performative pursuit of wealth often backfires. Especially for the middle class, there’s a cultural pressure to demonstrate success through visible symbols—designer brands, expensive-looking gadgets, opulent decor. But these symbols, when curated too loudly or out of context, often have the opposite effect.\nThe irony? In trying to look wealthy, many reveal just how unsure they feel about their place in the economic ladder. This isn’t about judgment. It’s about a deeper, quieter discomfort that we don’t talk about enough.\nPerforming wealth to soothe internal insecurity The middle class occupies a strange cultural space: not struggling, but not truly secure. There’s upward aspiration, but also the fear of slipping down. This creates a psychological tension that often manifests in how people present themselves.\nBuying a designer belt on credit. Flaunting a fake luxury watch. Over-decorating a small flat to mimic a hotel lobby. These habits don’t just reflect personal taste—they stem from a deep desire to belong to a class that seems just out of reach.\nSocial media intensifies this. Influencers, often projecting curated versions of affluence, set the aesthetic bar impossibly high. Middle-class viewers internalize these cues, leading to mimicry instead of authenticity. What emerges is not confidence, but costume.\nIn the UK, this is visible in high streets lined with aspirational branding. Nail salons offering “celebrity” makeovers, cafes with gold-painted lattes, council houses with rented Range Rovers in the driveway. These are not signs of economic freedom. They’re signs of performative anxiety.\nThe illusion sold by mass media and marketing One of the biggest distortions around wealth today comes from how it’s portrayed in media. What we see in reality shows, Instagram feeds, and celebrity profiles isn’t wealth—it’s the appearance of wealth. And that appearance has been algorithmically optimized to grab attention.\nIn my analysis of lifestyle marketing campaigns, I’ve seen how luxury gets repackaged for mass consumption. Brands know that middle-class consumers crave symbols of status, so they sell the illusion: high-end packaging, influencer partnerships, language that signals prestige. But the actual product? Often average.\nThis noise obscures the truth: genuine wealth rarely shouts. It doesn’t rely on bold logos or rented opulence. Instead, it shows up in time freedom, emotional ease, and the confidence not to perform.\nYet the noise persists. Pop psychology often reinforces this by linking self-worth to outward success. “Manifest your abundance,” “Dress for the job you want” —these messages blur self-esteem with status signaling. And in doing so, they fuel the cycle.\nThe clarity that changes everything The quietest people in the room often have the most.\nTrue wealth doesn’t need to be performed—it reveals itself quietly through confidence, ease, and freedom from the need to impress.\nThe people I’ve met who are genuinely wealthy rarely feel the urge to prove it. They wear what’s comfortable. They invest in experiences over appearances. They understand that money is a tool—not a personality.\nThis insight isn’t about shame. It’s about liberation. When we no longer feel pressured to look rich, we create room to actually be rich—in time, in mental clarity, in choices.\nLetting go of the performance So what does it look like to step off the stage?\nIt means dressing for your life, not for Instagram. Choosing quality over labels. Curating your home for comfort, not show. Talking about ideas instead of purchases. Spending money on things that matter to you , not things that signal mattering to others.\nOne woman I interviewed recently swapped her rented luxury car for a used hybrid. “I realized I was paying to impress people who weren’t even noticing,” she told me. Now she saves hundreds a month and feels lighter.\nLetting go of performance doesn’t mean giving up on aspiration. It means redirecting it inward. Toward security, freedom, and genuine joy. And perhaps most importantly: toward the quiet confidence that doesn’t need an audience.\nThat, in the end, might be the richest look of all.",

    "text": "El [Real Madrid](/tags/real-madrid-de-baloncesto/), impulsado por el argentino Facundo Campazzo con 17 puntos, despidió el año líder de la Liga Endesa tras ganar a Valencia Basket, que pasa a ser quinto de la clasificación. El partido comenzó en los primeros minutos con muchas alternativas y con dos triples, uno de Eli Ndiaye para el Real Madrid y otro de Xavier López-Aróstegui para Valencia Basket, que levantaron al público de sus asientos. El equipo blanco llevó la iniciativa ofensiva del partido, acertado en ataque con Facundo Campazzo y Edy Tavares liderando a sus compañeros en el primer cuarto, aunque el conjunto valenciano no permitió que su rival se escapara en el marcador pese a los fallos en los tiros libres, con una estadística de solo un punto de siete posibles al descanso. La entrada de Sergio Rodríguez a la pista dio otro aire al Real Madrid, que agradeció las asistencias del canario frente a un Valencia Basket al que sostuvieron en ataque el ugandés Brandon Davies y el armenio Chris Jones. Tras el descanso, cuando parecía que las fuerzas se volvían a igualar, sobre todo tras un triple de Semi Ojeleye que acercó a cuatro puntos a [Valencia](/tags/valencia-basket/), el Real Madrid reaccionó. Mejoró su fiabilidad defensiva, obligó a su rival a cometer fallos forzados y en ataque se mostró contundente, llegando al final del tercer cuarto con catorce puntos de ventaja y teniendo protagonismo de jugadores como Alberto Abalde, que deleitó a los asistentes con un gran triple. En el último cuarto el Real Madrid no quiso dejar margen a la sorpresa después de tres triples seguidos de Robertson y se encomendó a Ndiaye y Sergio Rodríguez, que respondieron con otros dos lanzamientos de tres que frenaron los ímpetus de Valencia. La defensa del equipo blanco, aguerrida en los últimos minutos, terminó por desesperar a Valencia Basket, que no encontró los mecanismos para hacer daño a su rival, sobre todo bajo el aro, con Tavares como mariscal defensivo. Con esta victoria el Real Madrid se mantiene líder con quince victorias y una sola derrota, mientras que Valencia Basket, que empezó el partido tercero, se sitúa quinto con diez victorias y seis derrotas. Ficha técnica: 83 - Real Madrid (20+21+26+16): Campazzo (17), Causeur (5), Musa (4), Ndiaye (12) y Tavares (13) -quinteto inicial- Abalde (7), Hezonja (6), Poirier (9), Llull (7), Hugo González, Sergio Rodríguez (3), 74 - Valencia Basket (15+19+19+21): Jones (19), López-Arostegui (10), Ojeleye (7), Inglis (2) y Davies (10) -quinteto inicial- Puerto, Reuvers (5), Anderson (2), Jovic (7), Pradilla (2) y Robertson (10).
