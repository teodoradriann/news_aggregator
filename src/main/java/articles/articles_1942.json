La empresa Aerolíneas Argentinas dejará de volar a Cuba desde el 8 de marzo próximo, a raíz de que ese destino no le resulta rentable. La compañía estatal ofrece una frecuencia semanal a La Habana y, según fuentes de la línea aérea, cada vuelo representa una pérdida de US$16.000: en 2023, ese tramo generó un rojo de US$500.000. La decisión se basó en un análisis comercial, que apunta a priorizar destinos que sean más beneficiosos desde el punto de vista económico. Por caso, se va a potenciar la ruta a Cancún, México, según publicó Infobae. ►TE PUEDE INTERESAR: [Se extiende la vigencia del Certificado Único de Discapacidad: ¿hasta cuándo es válido?](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/sociedad/se-extiende-la-vigencia-del-certificado-unico-discapacidad-hasta-cuando-es-valido-n1283088) Las fuentes consultadas indicaron que aquellos pasajeros que ya hubieran comprado su ticket para La Habana serán reubicados en vuelos de otras aerolíneas, sin ningún costo adicional. Pero en caso de querer cancelar su viaje, se les reintegrará el valor total del ticket. Recientemente, el Gobierno anunció la reducción en un 43% de la cantidad de destinos de la empresa, y de recortar en un 35% los reportes directos a la gerencia general. En consecuencia, Aerolíneas pasará de 14 direcciones a 8 y de 17 reportes directos a 11, como parte de su plan de racionalización. ►TE PUEDE INTERESAR: [Alertan que bebés y adultos mayores corren riesgos frente a la ola de calor en Mendoza](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/sociedad/alertan-que-bebes-y-adultos-mayores-corren-riesgos-frente-la-ola-calor-mendoza-n1283393)",

    "title": "Nigeria: A new dawn for women in irrigated farming",
    "text": "With over 220 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and the sixth most populated in the world. The country’s extreme poverty rates – approximately 46% of the country lives below the national poverty line of $2.15 per person per day – have severely impacted access to education and employment, particularly for females and marginalized groups. In Northern Nigeria alone, more than 48% of girls are not attending school. And while the country has low unemployment rates, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently reported unemployment rates of 5.3% in 2022 and 4.1% in early 2023 ( Nigeria Labour Force Survey (NLFS) , 2023) – underemployment and work in subsistence agriculture have trapped many in a cycle of poverty. Women farmers in Northern Nigeria were struggling with poor farming methods resulting in low yields. This was exacerbated by irrigation infrastructure in dire need of rehabilitation. \"Before, we used to experience a lot of hardships,\" says Baballiye Muhammad, one of the farmers at the Hadejia Valley Irrigation Scheme in Jigawa State, Nigeria. Increasing the competitiveness and productivity of Nigeria’s agricultural sector and raising incomes sustainably for the large share of the labor force working in agriculture will have an immediate impact on reducing the number of people living below the poverty line. The Federal Government of Nigeria, with financing from the World Bank, launched the Transforming Irrigation Management in Nigeria (TRIMING) Program. The program aims to achieve its transforming impact through the modernization of irrigation systems, improved water resources management, and assistance to women and men farmers in Northern Nigeria. TRIMING is contributing to Nigeria’s efforts in tackling poverty, food insecurity, and gender inequality. Through this project, Nigeria has rehabilitated irrigation infrastructures, expanded 30,000 hectares (ha) in five intervention schemes and reached 930,000 beneficiaries, of which, 45-50% are women. Among the completed schemes are the 5,750ha in Hadejia Valley Irrigation Scheme Jigawa State, and 14,444ha in Kano River Irrigation Scheme Kano State. The renovations have increased access to water for agriculture which has in turn bolstered women’s economic empowerment. The women who received support through the program are now fully engaged in irrigation farming, with an increase in crop yields of up to 60 percent. Participants are also more financially independent and contribute to household incomes. “The availability of water is making it possible for women to participate in farming. We have plenty of women farmers in Argina village who are getting good yields and profits from farming,” says Hajjala Adullahi, a farmer at Argina village in Jigawa State. Amina Salisu Tasiu, from Kura, Kano State, is another farmer benefitting from this development. Before participating in the TRIMING Program, she struggled with poor crop yields. The irrigation infrastructure she was using was old and dilapidated, and she lacked access to modern irrigation farming techniques. As her income dwindled, she could no longer afford tuition fees for the local school and her daughter, Rabi’atu, was forced to drop out. Around the world, women farmers like Amina have struggled to overcome the gender productivity gap. While women make up almost half of the global agricultural workforce, they consistently have less access to technologies, information, resources, and finance for their activities. Through the intervention of the TRIMING Program, Amina is one of the 20,000 women who are benefitting from the Kano River Irrigation Scheme, which rehabilitated local dams and irrigation infrastructure to improve water supply and water resource management. TRIMING implemented a Business School and Farmer Field Schools, where Amina was trained in modern farming techniques. She also received farming input, including fertilizer and seeds and implements. The support provided through the program helped Amina increase her crop yields by more than 60% and improve her income and livelihood. Today, her daughter Rabi’atu Salisu Tasiu is back in school. “The profits from my mother’s farm helped pay for my school fees. I was able to pass my exams and now want to go for higher education,” adds Rabiatu. The program takes a comprehensive approach of increasing farm productivity, building climate resilience, reducing flooding risks while improving the lives and well-being of millions of Nigerians. Due to various cultural barriers and outdated irrigation facilities, women like Rabiatu Bello could not participate in irrigated farming activities. The TRIMING Program encouraged women’s participation in farmer field and business schools, where farmers were taught modern farming techniques, business, and marketing. After training in the business school, Rabi joined Da Rarrafe Women Farmer Fields and Business Group in Zamfara State in Northern Nigeria. She has acquired knowledge of modern irrigation farming techniques and is now farming. \"The Triming Program has taught us modern farming technics which has helped increase my income from farming. I used the proceeds to buy a machine which helps me make more money from the farm,\" says Rabiatu. The program also created about 839 Water User Associations (WUAs), training and behavioral change programs, mobilization of youth as agents of change in the farming communities across all TRIMING intervention schemes. This support has strengthened Nigeria’s efforts around integrated water resources management planning, improved dam operations and safety, agricultural productivity and market linkages, innovations including research and development. The rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure under the TRIMING Program is transforming communities in Northern Nigeria. Improving access to water, even in times of severe drought. This is helping to ensure food security and economic stability. The inclusion of women has been equally transformative. When women like Amina and Rabiatu receive the same access to irrigation technologies, training, and inputs as men, agricultural production increases and nutrition improves, resulting in healthier, more resilient communities.",

    "text": "In the thrilling world of crime-fighting canines, there’s one Labrador Retriever who’s been making headlines for his exceptional olfactory prowess. Meet Odin, the electronic detection K9 who recently played a role in investigating a covert camera operation at Hoyland Elementary School .\nOdin, the four-legged detective, is not your average dog. While some canines might spend their days chasing squirrels or playing fetch, Odin is on a mission to sniff out hidden electronics. His latest adventure led him to the halls of Hoyland Elementary School, where hidden cameras were found in a staff bathroom.\nA janitor named Erik Fernando Carreon was identified as the culprit and promptly terminated from his position.\nRELATED: Spring ISD janitor arrested, accused of installing cameras in staff bathrooms at elementary school According to court documents, Carreon admitted to buying and installing cameras in two bathrooms, capturing footage of unsuspecting female employees using the facilities. Carreon now faces charges of invasive visual recording.\nIn the aftermath of the discovery, Odin combed through the entire campus to ensure no other lurking devices remained hidden. Fortunately, no additional cameras were found.\nAs for Carreon, he posted a $10,000 bond and has been released. Meanwhile, Odin continues to be a canine hero, tirelessly patrolling the world of electronics to keep hidden cameras and other devices at bay.\nBut how does Odin do it? Detective Clint Beasley, Odin’s human partner in crime-fighting, spilled the beans on the Lab’s incredible abilities. According to Beasley, Odin is trained to detect a specific chemical compound that’s sprayed onto storage devices and memory chips during the manufacturing process.\n“Odin is an electronic storage detection K-9 and he detects anything with digital storage,” Beasley explained. “So USBs, hard drives, cellphones, SD cards, micro SD cards, anything that can hold evidence.”\nRELATED: ‘Protect your privacy’: How to protect yourself from hidden cameras Odin is the first electronic detection dog in Harris County and one of only four in the entire state. Beasley and Odin are integral members of the Houston Metro Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program, focusing primarily on child exploitation cases.\nBeasley emphasized Odin’s love for work, describing him not just as a partner but as a tool that they’ve been fortunate to have and utilize extensively.\n“Odin is a tool we’ve been lucky enough to get and use as much as we can,” Beasley stated.\nThe tale of electronic-sniffing dogs, like Odin, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Beasley shed light on their history, referencing the case of Bear, a black Labrador who played a pivotal role in the arrest of former Subway pitchman Jared Fogle in 2015. Bear’s keen nose unearthed a thumb drive that had eluded human detection during a search of Fogle’s Indiana house.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "CSS y Hospital Santo Tomás firman convenio para suministro de alimentos desde la Ciudad de la Salud\nMás 3,000 comidas diarias suministrará la cocina de la Ciudad de la Salud al Hospital Santo Tomás.\nCiudad de Panamá, Panamá/Con el objetivo de optimizar la atención alimentaria en el sistema público de salud, autoridades de la Caja de Seguro Social (CSS) y el Patronato del Hospital Santo Tomás firmaron un convenio para la preparación y suministro de alimentos destinados a pacientes, personal médico, de enfermería y administrativo del Hospital Santo Tomás.\nEl acuerdo establece que, a partir del 1 de mayo y durante un periodo de 60 meses, la moderna cocina de Línea Fría ubicada en la Ciudad de la Salud preparará y trasladará diariamente unas 3,000 comidas al Servicio de Nutrición y Dietética del Hospital Santo Tomás.\nDurante el acto de firma, el director general de la CSS, Dino Mon, destacó que los menús son diseñados con criterios clínicos definidos por profesionales de la salud.\n“Cada menú responde a las condiciones médicas, el estado nutricional y la etapa de recuperación del paciente. No es lo mismo alimentar que nutrir” subrayó.\n- Te puede interesar:\nPanamá y Costa Rica inauguran de forma conjunta la Semana de Vacunación en las Américas 2025\nEl ministro de Salud, Fernando Boyd Galindo, explicó que este sistema de distribución funciona bajo el modelo de \"comida en frío\", donde los alimentos se trasladan en estructuras especiales con temperaturas controladas y se calientan cerca del lugar donde se encuentra el paciente. Este mecanismo permite mantener la calidad e inocuidad de las comidas durante el traslado.\nPor su parte, el contralor general de la República, Anel Flores, resaltó el valor estratégico del convenio.\n“Estas son las cosas que hay que hacer con transparencia. Hay una ganancia por parte del Seguro Social, por el uso de sus instalaciones, y un ahorro por parte del Ministerio de Salud, por el servicio que se le brinda. Esta es una muestra de que estamos todos empeñados en buscar mejores ahorros para que el país sea mejor” afirmó.\nEste acuerdo representa un paso más en la modernización de los servicios hospitalarios del país y busca garantizar una alimentación adecuada y segura para miles de personas que reciben atención médica en uno de los principales centros hospitalarios de Panamá.",
