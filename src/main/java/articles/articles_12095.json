    "text": "The state Economic Development Authority has granted Explore Siouxland a $ 10,000 tourism grant. The funding is intended to support the Wheel the World project, which aims to make attractions more accessible for travelers with access needs.\nSpokesperson Kristen Heimgartner shares about the Wheel the World project and the support for Explore Siouxland: \"We pick a couple of restaurants, hotels, and attractions that we think would be a good fit.\" Then, people with mobility issues are asked to take a survey in order to help the project leads assess how accessible the hospitality establishments and attractions really are. The feedback is taken into consideration and the businesses, alongside Explore Siouxland, take proactive steps to address the issues associated with access.\nIn this initial round, ten businesses are taking part in the Wheel the World initiative.\nImage Credit: Explore Siouxland\nExplore Siouxland Receives a Grant to Bolster Accessibility\nReferences:\nwheeltheworld&radioiowaTrend Themes\n1.

También se reportó la caída de un árbol en las inmediaciones de la avenida Camelinas en su cruce con Ventura Puente, por lo que la circulación tuvo que ser cerrada mientras el personal trabajó en el retiro de las ramas. Protección Civil del estado y el cuerpo de Bomberos y Protección Civil de Morelia se movilizaron en distintos puntos de la capital del estado para evaluar los daños y auxiliar a las personas afectadas.

    "title": "Top 3 Cryptocurrencies Under $1 That Could Surge in Q1 2024",
    "text": "The cryptocurrency market faced a sharp correction this week. However, the market seems to be regaining traction, with Bitcoin (BTC) gaining 2.5% in the daily charts and the global crypto market cap rising 2.2% in 24 hours to $1.75 trillion.\nMoreover, there is a possibility that the crypto market will enter a bull run very soon, as analysts anticipate the US\nSEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) to approve a spot BTC ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) this month. A spot BTC ETF coupled with BTC’s halving event in April could usher in a 2021-like bull run for the cryptocurrency industry.\nTherefore, let’s look at three cryptocurrency projects under $1 that could surge in the first quarter of 2024.\nTop 3 cryptocurrencies under $1 for Q1 2024\nCardano (ADA):\nCardano (ADA) is one of the most developmentally active crypto projects. The token has faced a sharp correction of over 9% in the weekly charts. However, the low prices create an opportunity for new investors to buy the token for cheap. Since January 2023, ADA’s price has surged by over 100%. A similar, if not better, scenario may unfold for the ninth-largest cryptocurrency in 2024.\nAlso Read: Cardano: How High Can ADA Trade In 2024?\nXRP:\nRipple’s XRP token is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies for cross-border remittance. However, there is some legal unclarity regarding the status of XRP. The SEC alleges that Ripple’s sale of XRP breaches securities laws. Although a district court ruled that selling XRP to retail clients did not breach securities laws, the suit has entered the high court, and investors are awaiting a verdict. If the high court rules in Ripple’s favor, XRP’s price may surge to new heights.\nDogecoin (DOGE):\nDogecoin (DOGE) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there. However, the token took a backseat in 2023. Since January 2023, DOGE’s price has surged by only about 13%, while other altcoins surged by triple digits. Despite the lackluster performance last year, there is a possibility that DOGE will surge to a new all-time high in 2024. There is talk about DOGE’s inclusion in X’s upcoming payment feature. If so, the memecoin may see a surge in adoption and hence a price rise.",
