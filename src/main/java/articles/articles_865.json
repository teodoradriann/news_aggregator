    "text": "12/03/2025 - 20:55\nA Defesa Civil estadual de São Paulo testou, pela primeira vez, um drone de grande porte para a pulverização de larvicidas no combate ao mosquito Aedes aegypti, vetor da dengue, na cidade de Mairiporã, região metropolitana de São Paulo.\nO modelo Agras MG1P, geralmente usado para pulverização agrícola, foi testado em residências com pontos de proliferação do mosquito, como piscinas sujas, locais de acúmulo de lixo, caixas d’água abertas, e em áreas que não atendem a apelos dos agentes de saúde.\nNotícias relacionadas:\nO drone escolhido tem autonomia de voo de 15 e 20 minutos, por bateria, podendo chegar a 50 metros de altura e voar a até um quilômetro do operador. O limite de operação durante o teste foi menor, em torno de 150 metros, uma vez que a região é urbana e há maior risco de interferência. O equipamento carrega até 10 litros de larvicida.\nEmbora Mairiporã tenha baixa incidência da doença (15,9/100 mil habitantes), o município tem imóveis de veraneio em áreas rurais, com terrenos grandes e dificuldade de acesso pelas equipes de saúde, segundo informou Maxwell de Souza, porta-voz da Defesa Civil do Estado de São Paulo.",

    "text": "Why is this guy driving? Democrat Senator John Fetterman (PA) and his wife Gisele Fetterman, were injured in a car crash Sunday morning in Maryland and transported to a nearby hospital. Stroke victim John Fetterman was driving and crashed his vehicle into the back of a Chevy Impala. According to a Maryland State Police report, Senator Fetterman is ‘at fault’ for the car accident. The report stated that Fetterman was traveling “at a high rate of speed, well over the posted speed limit” when he slammed into the Chevy Impala. The posted speed limit was 70 miles per hour and a witness said Fetterman flew by her at a high rate of speed! Fetterman was NOT tested for drugs or alcohol. No citations were issued. Both vehicles involved in the accident were towed away. According to The Washington Post, Fetterman had speeding tickets before his car accident. The Democrat Senator has also texted and FaceTimed aides while driving! Fetterman got two speeding tickets for going 24 miles per hour over the speed limit. He was required to complete a driver’s improvement course after getting caught driving 34 miles per hour over the speed limit. The Washington Post reported : Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) was speeding and at fault for a Sunday morning auto accident in western Maryland, where he rear-ended another driver, a 62-year old woman who was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, according to a Maryland State Police report. Fetterman was also treated for a shoulder injury, and he and his wife were taken to the hospital by ambulance, according to the police report and information from his office. Fetterman brushed off the wreck afterward, brandishing a bag of frozen peas and Tylenol in a video Monday with his wife and thanking people for their well wishes. The accident was the latest example of unsafe driving by Fetterman, according to public records and people with knowledge of the situation. He has received two speeding tickets for violations of at least 24 miles per hour above the speed limit, one in 2016 and one in March, according to Pennsylvania state records. After the ticket this year, when he was driving 34 miles per hour over the limit, he was required by the state to complete a driver’s improvement course, according to a person familiar with the outcome who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the episode. Neither record said exactly where he was driving or how fast he was going.",

    "text": "Beautiful Day to Kick Off the New Year! Sunny Day for Boating SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - After a chilly pineapple drop in downtown Sarasota with temperatures in the mid 50s at midnight, a warm and sunny New Year’s day will be a welcoming start to 2024. Dew points remain low, winds will be light and no rain is in the forecast to kick off the year. It will be a gorgeous day with high temperatures around 70 degrees. Morning lows will linger between in the upper 40s and low will stay mostly in the 50s for the next few days. If your New Year’s resolution involves more boating in 2024, then Monday will be the perfect day to kick off the New Year on the water. Bay and inland waters will have a light chop with seas two feet, then dying down to a foot later in the day. Winds will be fairly light out of the southwest. A moderate ultraviolet index is expected, but with the sunshine you will probably appreciate sunglasses and maybe a hat on the boat. Highs will hit the upper 60s to around 70 along the beaches. The gulf water temperature remains chilly in the mid 60s. Two fronts will make their way through the Suncoast later this week. One will bring rain early Thursday morning, and the second will be a bit more intense bringing rain and possible thunderstorms Saturday. Both storms will pass through in one day, bringing drier cooler air in their wake. Highs remain in the mid 60s to low 70s this week, with lows mostly in the mid 50s. Copyright 2023 WWSB.
