    "text": "Liver health is finally in the spotlight, and honestly, it’s about time. For the longest stretch, people only paid attention to their liver when binge-drinking or during a serious doctor’s visit involving hepatitis. But now? From fatty liver concerns to detox advice and enzyme level checks, the liver is suddenly front and center—and for good reason.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is on the rise, quietly becoming a global health issue. The kicker? You don’t need to touch alcohol to have liver problems anymore. Unhealthy eating habits, excess sugar, a sedentary lifestyle, and stress are enough to mess it up. What’s worse—most people don’t even know their liver’s struggling until things are already serious.And let’s not forget—your liver does way more than process alcohol. It’s your body’s detox champion, filtering toxins from medications, pollutants, processed food, and more. If your liver is under strain, your whole body feels it. From breakouts and hormone issues to fatigue—your liver may be behind the scenes of it all.Thanks to the wellness wave and growing focus on holistic health, people are now looking beyond visible muscles or calorie counts. They want to feel good from the inside out—and a healthy liver is key to that.What Dr. Saurabh Sethi has to sayPopular on social media for his health insights, Dr. Saurabh Sethi recently explained how liver disease develops—starting from fatty liver, progressing to inflammation, and ultimately, cirrhosis if ignored. In his video, he highlighted two key strategies for maintaining liver health:Cutting back on alcoholImproving metabolic healthLet’s break them down.Your liver is a powerhouse, but it needs helpYour liver is like the hardest-working employee in your body—it detoxes, stores energy, breaks down fats, and keeps your internal systems running smoothly. But today’s lifestyle—marked by sugary snacks, lack of movement, and weekend drinking—is taking a toll.Alcohol is a known liver enemy, and not just in large quantities. Even moderate drinking, when consistent, can silently harm your liver. That’s because when the liver breaks down alcohol, it produces a toxic byproduct—acetaldehyde—which causes inflammation and scarring. Left unchecked, this can progress to fatty liver, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis. The scary part? These changes often come without warning signs.The good news: Your liver can regenerate—but only if you stop stressing it. Reducing alcohol intake, even slightly, can give your liver space to heal and function better.The other culprit: Poor metabolic healthEven without alcohol, your liver can suffer—especially when your metabolic health is off. Think high blood sugar, insulin resistance, belly fat—this combo can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now a leading cause of liver damage globally.When your diet is overloaded with refined carbs and sugar, your liver stores the excess as fat. Pair that with low activity and poor sleep, and you’ve got a recipe for chronic liver stress.How to support your liver—The right wayForget expensive liver detox powders or week-long juice cleanses. Real liver care comes down to simple lifestyle shifts:Cut the sugar and processed carbsBe more active—even daily walking helpsEat real, whole foodsGet enough sleepMaintain a healthy weightEven small improvements can pay off. Losing just 5–10% of your body weight can reduce liver fat. Better sleep reduces inflammation. Moving more boosts insulin sensitivity. It's all connected.[With TOI inputs]",

    "text": "Cardale Jones wasn’t impressed with\nMiami in its latest bowl loss to Rutgers. The former Ohio State quarterback ripped both the coaching staff and fanbase, saying he “feels bad” for recruits headed to The U.\nThe Hurricanes were beaten soundly by the Scarlet Knights on Thursday, falling 31-24 in the Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl.\nMiami scored a late touchdown to make the score seem closer than it actually was, but for the most part, it was all\nRutgers.\nGreg Schiano’s bunch jumped out to a quick 14-0 lead before the ‘Canes bounced back with 17 straight points. Over the last 25 minutes of play, however, they’d be outscored 17-7, with that lone touchdown coming with the game in hand.\nRutgers controlled the line of scrimmage, rushing for over 200 yards against the Miami defense. They only needed seven passing completions to win the game.\nCardale Jones was tuned into that B1G-ACC matchup, providing commentary for his online following throughout.\nNever thought I’d see a day where Rutgers DOMINATES a team lol\n[#BIG10]!!!!\n— Cardale Jones (@CJ1two)\n[December 28, 2023]\nMost of that reaction was negative towards the Hurricanes.\nHe went for the kill after seeing Miami fall behind by two scores in the second half, blasting both the staff and university in a\nwarning to recruits.\n“Man, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami for NIL,” Jones wrote. “Bad staff, no stability within program, and one of the worst college home game atmospheres. Chasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck.”\nJones points to the\ntypically awful environment at Hurricane home games, one that a multitude of gameday promotions couldn’t help this past season.\nHe also noted the NIL program, which has made waves with\nlucrative offers to prospective athletes over the last few years.\nMany at Miami believed they’d found the savior for a struggling program in head coach Mario Cristobal, but he’s gone just 12-12 in two seasons at the helm with\nlosses to the likes of Middle Tennesse State, Duke, and Georgia Tech.\nHis 2023 loss to the Yellow Jackets\nreceived immense criticism after he refused to kneel the ball with the game in hand, leading to a turnover and subsequent game-winning score for GT.\nMiami’s season came to a deflating end with the bowl game loss on Thursday. We’ll see if Cristobal and Co. can change Cardale Jones’s mind next year.",

    "title": "UN Security Council demands Iran-backed Yemen rebels halt their attacks on ships in Mideast waters",
    "text": "By Edith M. Lederer ,\n1 hour ago\nThe U.N. Security Council on Thursday approved a resolution demanding Yemen’s Houthi rebels halt all attacks on ships and urged that the disruption to maritime security in a critical Middle East waterway be urgently addressed.\nThe resolution made no mention that the Iran-backed rebels claim they are staging the attacks because of the Israel- Hamas war in Gaza .\nThe resolution, which also extended the requirement that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres report monthly on the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, was approved by a 12-0 vote, with Russia, China and Algeria abstaining.\nShipping has reduced drastically through the route crucial to Asian, Middle East and European markets in a campaign the Houthis say will continue as long as the war rages in the Gaza Strip.\nThe resolution condemns the Houthis’ continuing attacks, which the rebels say are aimed at ending the war in Gaza, now in its ninth month — emphasizing the need to address root causes, “including the conflicts contributing to regional tensions and the disruption to maritime security.\"\nSparked by Hamas’ surprise attack on Oct. 7 in which the militants stormed into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the war has so far killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nThe Houthis have targeted more than 60 vessels in the waterway, firing missiles and drones. Four sailors have been killed, one vessel was seized and two others have been sunk in Rebel attacks since November.\nThe Houthis maintain they target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the vessels attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war — including some bound for Iran.\nIn response, a U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, including a series of strikes on May 30 that killed at least 16 people and wounded 42, according to the rebels.\nYemen has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Houthis seized much of northern Yemen and forced he internationally recognized government to flee from the capital, Sanaa. A Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year in support of government forces, and in time the conflict turned into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nThough fighting has decreased considerably since a six-month truce in 2022, the war has devastated the Arab region’s poorest country and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters.\nThursday's resolution, which was a follow-up resolution to one adopted Jan. 10 that condemned and demanded an immediate halt to Houthi attacks, “urges caution and restraint to avoid further escalation of the situation in the Red Sea and the broader region.”\nSpeaking on behalf of the United States and Japan, which sponsored the resolution, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said after Thursday's vote that the Houthi attacks “threaten international peace and security” and that they are “a global challenge” that \"necessitates a global solution.\"\n\"With this resolution the council once again sends a clear message to the Houthis: Cease these attacks immediately,” he said.\nHe stressed the need to deprive the Houthis of weapons, noting that the resolution reiterates all countries are required to implement a 2015 U.N. arms embargo on Houthis and others undermining Yemen’s stability.\nRussia’s deputy ambassador Anna Evstigneeva said Moscow supports the safety of navigation in the Red Sea and other waters adjacent to Yemen, but she accused the “so-called U.S. coalition” of using the January resolution to justify its attacks on the Houthis.\n“We urge all participants in the coalition to immediately halt illegal attacks and to transition to political and diplomatic means to reduce tensions in the waters adjacent to Yemen,” Evstigneeva said.\nChina’s deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang said Beijing has repeatedly called on the Houthis to end their attacks on commercial ships but abstained as it did in January because some key elements in the resolution “could have negative consequences and lead to further escalation of regional tensions.”\nHe pointed to actions by “certain countries” against Yemen that have not only killed civilians and damaged infrastructure, “but also heightened security risks in the Red Sea waters.”\nAn immediate and lasting cease-fire in Gaza “will help cool down the situation in Yemen and the Red Sea,” Geng said.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Así es cómo Elon Musk ha convertido X en una red social \"tóxica\" de la que están huyendo cientos de miles de usuarios",
    "text": "\"La campaña electoral presidencial de EEUU ha subrayado lo que hemos considerado durante mucho tiempo: X es una red social tóxica y su propietario, Elon Musk, ha usado su influencia para dar forma al discurso político\", así anunciaba The Guardian el pasado miércoles 13 de noviembre su salida de la que siempre se ha conocido como Twitter. En España se han sumado otros medios y usuarios a la que ya es la mayor pérdida de usuarios de la historia de esta red social.\nEl día que Donald Trump ganó por segunda vez la presidencia de Estados Unidos, más de 46 millones de usuarios visitaron la red social propiedad de Musk, más que cualquier otro día de 2023, según datos de Similar Web . Sin embargo, ese mismo día, más de 115.000 usuarios entraron en X y tomaron la decisión de eliminar su cuenta. Desde entonces el goteo de bajas ha seguido creciendo, incluyendo a importantes medios de comunicación. Según Financial Times , en Estados Unidos, la plataforma ha perdido una quinta parte de sus usuarios.\nUna pérdida así no se había producido, ni siquiera cuando el nuevo dueño de la red social desbloqueó la cuenta del teórico de la conspiración y de extrema derecha, Alex Jones, decisión que tomó en base a una encuesta informal que había realizado en un tuit . Entonces se fueron 65.000 usuarios, el pico anterior a la actual debacle. Estas son las cifras estadounidenses, las más pronunciadas, pero a nivel global, se han marcharon más de 280.000 personas.\nGráfico con la eliminación de cuentas de X (Twitter) en los últimos años Similar Web Omicrono\nAún no hay datos sobre una disminución de la actividad, pero sí de la repercusión de este éxodo masivo en la competencia. En busca de un nuevo hogar, Threads y Bluesky se están llevando el premio gordo. Threads, la alternativa creada por Mark Zuckerberg como respuesta al primer año de Elon Musk como propietario de X, asegura haber recibido \"más de 15 millones de registros solo en noviembre. Por su parte, Bluesky dice haber superado los 15 millones de usuarios el pasado miércoles.\nLa dirección del multimillonario ha suscitado constantemente la polémica desde que compró Twitter en 2022. Su simple llegada provocó 200.000 cuentas desactivadas. Hasta ahora con su apoyo y participación en la campaña del Partido Republicano contra Joe Biden, primero, y Kamala Harris, después. Esta semana Trump le ha recompensado con un puesto de liderazgo en el Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental .\n[Cómo migrar de X a Bluesky: así puedes abandonar el servicio de Elon Musk por la nueva red social del creador de Twitter] Cuando compró la empresa de redes sociales en octubre de 2022, Musk prometió que, bajo su dirección, la plataforma no tomaría partido en la política. \"Para que Twitter merezca la confianza del público, debe ser políticamente neutral, lo que significa efectivamente molestar a la extrema derecha y a la extrema izquierda por igual\", publicó Musk en su perfil . En pocas semanas, abandonó las pautas de moderación de la plataforma en nombre de la libertad de expresión, de la que se considera el mayor defensor. Este fue el principio de la mayor transformación que ha sufrido esta red social.\nX, un altavoz político Tras la victoria de Trump, el podcaster de extrema derecha, Joe Rogan indicó que cualquiera que pensara que Twitter alguna vez valió 44.000 millones de dólares era un \"maldito imbécil\". La que fue calificada por Wall Street Journal como \"la peor compra de bancos desde la crisis financiera\", se entiende ahora como todo lo contrario al quedar patente el poder social que tienen las redes sociales .\nSemanas después de que Musk asumiera el cargo, la aplicación restauró más de 62.000 cuentas que habían sido suspendidas previamente por violaciones a las políticas, en una acción que Musk llamó \"amnistía general\" . Entre ellos estaban Donald Trump que había sido expulsado por realizar afirmaciones falsas sobre el voto por correo, tras perder la presidencia en las elecciones de 2020. Entonces, Twitter se limitaba a etiquetar estas publicaciones con enlaces a información verificada, pero no fue suficiente y terminó por borrar mensajes y expulsar a usuarios de gran relevancia como el expresidente.\nElon Musk, adalid de los discursos de odio: de la violencia en Reino Unido a su charla con Trump\nOtra gran medida que tomó el magnate al llegar fue destacar su cuenta oficial. Gran parte de la influencia de Musk en X se debe al ritmo con el que publica, pero también está propiciada por los cambios en el funcionamiento de la red social. A principios de 2023, el multimillonario hizo que los ingenieros de Twitter agregaran una línea de código para promocionar su propio perfil , la cual aparece en el muro \"Para ti\" con frecuencia aunque no se sea seguidor suyo. Con más de 202 millones de seguidores, la cuenta de Elon Musk es la más seguida de X , por un margen de más de 71 millones con el segundo, Barack Obama.\nLa semana de las elecciones, en solo cuatro días, Musk llegó a publicar 400 mensajes sobre política celebrando la victoria de Donald Trump . Es solo una muestra de la intensa campaña a favor del republicado a la que ha servido de altavoz X, en general, y la cuenta de Musk en particular. El magnate entrevistó al reelegido presidente durante dos horas en una conversación amistosa y plagada de afirmaciones falsas . El día de las elecciones, The New York Times recoge que usuarios de otras plataformas populares entre la extrema derecha como Gab, Parler y Truth Social, recurrían a X para obtener noticias electorales.\n[Musk ignora los avisos de la Justicia: sigue otorgando premios de un millón de dólares a votantes de EEUU] Durante la campaña Musk promovió una Comunidad X, formada por un gran grupo de usuarios, llamada Election Integrity Community y creada por su súper PAC, América PAC. Un super PAC es una organización privada que tiene el propósito de ayudar o influir en las elecciones y la adopción de ciertas leyes en EEUU mediante la inversión de dinero. La comunidad se agregó automáticamente al muro que los usuarios ven cuando entran en X.\nNBC indica que la comunidad se llenó de teorías de conspiración, desinformación, rumores y sospechas sobre fraude electoral. Recientemente ha instado a los tuiteros a reemplazar a los medios de comunicación e informar sobre el regreso triunfal de Trump al poder. El magnate ha compartido noticias falsas y bulos en su perfil en más de una ocasión, además de despreciar la labor de periodistas y medios .\nOdio y pornografía Musk entró en las oficinas del entonces Twitter dispuesto a hacer limpieza (con un lavabo en la mano a modo de metáfora), despidiendo sin contemplaciones a la mitad de la plantilla de la empresa , cerca de 3.700 personas. Incluso hubo despidos fulminantes de quienes se atrevieron a llevarle la contraria públicamente en Twitter. Según un informe publicado por el propio Twitter en 2023, la compañía sólo cuenta con 20 moderadores de contenidos que hablan español, del total de 2.294 empleados destinados a regular el contenido de la plataforma, aunque no queda claro si esa cifra se refiera sólo a Europa o a todo el mundo.\nLet that sink in pic.twitter.com/XvYFtDrhRm\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 6, 2024 Sin personal que revise y modere las millones de publicaciones delicadas que se realizan a diario, la red social se ha convertido en el salvaje oeste. En diciembre de 2022, poco más de dos meses después de que Elon Musk comprase Twitter, varios estudios llevados a cabo por investigadores de organizaciones como la Liga Antidifamación y recopilados por The New York Times apuntaban que el discurso de odio (incluidos ataques racistas, antisemitas y homófobos) se habían disparado en la red social. Por ejemplo, mientras que antes aparecían una media diaria de 1.282 insultos racistas contra los negros, desde que el hombre más rico del mundo pasó a controlar la plataforma, la cifra se ha triplicó hasta los 3.876.\nLas pocas respuestas que ha dado la empresa, al margen de las contestaciones provocadoras de Musk, redirigen directamente a las notas de la comunidad, anotaciones que los usuarios pueden añadir a las publicaciones . Todos los usuarios de la red social pueden ver los mensajes con o sin ilustraciones y un comentario debajo donde se aclara el contexto o correcciones de ese contenido que puede ser falso o engañoso. Las notas las escriben y supervisan los propios usuarios que son libres de apuntarse a esta comunidad de supervisores. Antes de que el resto de usuarios puedan verlas, las anotaciones deben recibir un mínimo de votos de la comunidad de colaboradores.\nEuropa Pres | X El Androide Libre\n[Elon Musk se rinde al porno: la red social X se convierte en un rival de OnlyFans, siempre y cuando sigas estas reglas] Además de insultos y desinformación, la pornografía también se ha convertido en un contenido habitual de la red social. En 2023, investigadores de Stanford han detectado imágenes de abuso infantil que ya se encontraban en bases de datos usadas para filtrar contenido. En ocasiones, basta con pinchar un hashtag relacionado con algún tema de actualidad para que el visitante acabe sin pretenderlo en una secuencias de tuits con contenido pornográfico .\nBots verificados y bloqueos light La Comisión Europea tiene varias investigaciones abiertas sobre X, sobre todo en relación con el sistema para moderar la desinformación y el contenido ilegal. Antes de dimitir el pasado mes de septiembre, Thierry Breton, Comisario de Mercado Interior de la Unión Europea, publicaba esta semana su segunda carta en menos de un año para instar a X a cumplir con las reglas de la región contra el contenido dañino. Musk le contestaba con burlas.\nPixabay Omicrono\n[Del intento de Reino Unido a la censura de China: así evitan las redes sociales la legislación contra el anonimato online ] Además de la falta de moderación, Musk también fue duramente criticado por deconstruir el sistema del tick azul que antes reflejaba las cuentas verificadas, para otorgarlo solo a los usuarios de pago. Fue necesario crear nuevas marcas de otros colores para destacar las cuentas oficiales de empresas, organizaciones e instituciones, así como algunos famosos .\nNo obstante, el check azul sigue significado que la persona ha pagado por tener funciones exclusivas, no que se trate de una persona real cuyos datos han sido verificados. Esta marca se ha denostado hasta el punto de que algunos suscriptores quisieran ocultarla , posibilidad que la empresa ha eliminado.\nFotomontaje con el logo de X y el verificado. Manuel Fernández Omicrono\nEl también dueño de SpaceX y Tesla prometió que su sistema de pago en Twitter sería la respuesta para limpiar la red social de bots y cuentas falsas , pero aún no lo ha conseguido. El anonimato de las cuentas no verificadas y la falta de transparencia de la compañía dificultan saber hasta dónde llega el problema de bots generadores de bulos y spam, así como detener a los infractores de delitos de odio.\nEn medio de toda esta crispación, Musk ha seguido aplicando medidas controvertidas como cambiar la función de bloqueo que sirve como herramienta ante el acoso en todas las redes sociales. Aunque bloquees a un usuario, este podrá seguir leyendo lo que publiques , aunque no podrá interactuar contigo. Otro clásico elemento que quiere borrar es el recuento de likes y retuits, aunque aún no está claro cuándo o si realmente llevará a cabo esta promesa. Ya en agosto del año pasado Musk generó discordia con la decisión de eliminar los titulares de los artículos enlazados en los tuits de X; algo de lo que se acabaría retractando en los meses posteriores .\nAprovecha su IA, sin filtro Toda la masa de mensajes publicados durante años, veraces o no, ofensivos o no, se han utilizado y se siguen utilizando para entrenar al modelo de lenguaje natural de la empresa. Musk también se ha querido subir a este caballo con su estilo propio, Sin avisar a los usuarios y teniendo estos que buscar en los ajusts como rechazar el uso de sus mensajes para nutrir a la IA. Grok 2, así se llama, no ha dejado indiferente a nadie, la nueva versión de su alternativa a herramientas de generación de contenido como ChatGPT o Gemini se ha lanzado recientemente, sin censura.\nLa IA de Musk no tiene reparos en generar las imágenes que otras IA se niegan a crear : desde escenas de propaganda política, imágenes de mujeres sexualizadas y personas famosas en situaciones embarazosas, como Barack Obama frente a unas rayas de cocaína. Así es la \"IA más divertida del mundo\", según la describe el multimillonario, el mismo que pidió parar el desarrollo de esta tecnología el año pasado por el riesgo que supone para la humanidad. Ahora es uno de sus mayores clientes, compartiendo numerosas imágenes generadas por IA .\nTuit de Elon Musk con imagen generada por IA Captura de X / Omicrono Omicrono\nMás allá de las bromas de mal gusto, esta tecnología ya se usa para difundir más rápido desinformación y ciberataques, incluso en casos donde sí se intenta evitar que se use mal. OpenAI ha denunciado varias operaciones contra campañas de desinformación que usaban ChatGPT para crear bulos y después los subían a las redes.\nRedes sociales X Elon Musk Inteligencia artificial España Tecnología Fake News Twitter NEWSLETTER - TECNOLOGÍA Recibe de lunes a viernes las noticias clave sobre tecnología Apuntarme De conformidad con el RGPD y la LOPDGDD, EL LEÓN DE EL ESPAÑOL PUBLICACIONES, S.A. tratará los datos facilitados con la finalidad de remitirle noticias de actualidad.",
