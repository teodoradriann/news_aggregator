    "title": "How Air Pollution Threatens The Success Of IVF According To A New Study",
    "text": "The demand for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is higher than ever, but a new study reveals that air pollution may be impacting the success of these procedures. Published last month, the research indicates that the delicate process of IVF, which already has a success rate of less than 50%, could be hindered by environmental factors, specifically air pollution.\nUnderstanding IVF and Its Vulnerabilities IVF is an assisted reproductive technology that involves extracting eggs from a patient and fertilizing them in a laboratory setting. The resulting embryos are matured for several days, after which they can either be frozen for future use or implanted back into the patient, hoping one will successfully implant and result in a healthy pregnancy. However, recent findings suggest that environmental factors, such as air quality, could significantly influence the outcome.\nResearchers at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health conducted a study that linked air pollution data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with addresses associated with the eggs and sperm used in IVF cycles. The study analyzed the effects of air pollution on egg development, ovarian stimulation, and sperm quality.\nTracking air quality during critical stages of IVF By tracking the air quality during the critical stages of IVF, the team found a clear connection between increased exposure to pollutants and decreased egg survival and embryo quality. Notably, higher concentrations of certain pollutants, particularly on the day eggs were thawed, were associated with lower egg survival rates and fertilization success.\nA unique aspect of this study, published in Environment International , was the inclusion of donor eggs, allowing researchers to examine how pollution affects both the egg and sperm separately. The use of donor eggs, which come from women living in different environments, enabled the team to distinguish the impacts of pollution on the male and female contributors.\nStudy Sample and Findings The study involved data from 500 egg donors and 915 couples, with the male partner providing sperm. The researchers found that organic carbon, a component of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), showed a consistent negative effect on egg survival and embryo quality. PM2.5 particles, which are small enough to enter the lungs and bloodstream, are often produced by vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and wildfires, making them a significant environmental health concern.\nMary Willis, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, praised the study, noting its innovation in examining the timing and biological mechanisms involved. “This is probably one of the only studies where you can get at really, really specific biological mechanisms and timing,” Willis said. “Because it’s IVF, you know exactly when ovarian stimulation is happening. You know exactly when fertilization is happening. So you can get some really specific answers to biological questions that haven’t been answered in the literature.”\nWidespread Air Pollution and Public Health Concerns Despite its significant findings, the study has its limitations. It primarily focused on individual pollutants, like organic carbon, but air pollution is typically composed of a mix of various pollutants. LaPointe mentioned that future research will involve multi-pollutant analysis to better understand the complex ways in which air pollution affects IVF outcomes.\nAlthough air quality has improved in the U.S. over recent decades, nearly 40% of the population still lives in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone or particulate pollution, according to the American Lung Association. Communities of color are disproportionately affected by poorer air quality, increasing the urgency of understanding the health implications, particularly for individuals undergoing fertility treatments.\nThis study follows similar research published earlier in the year, which analyzed data from 3,659 frozen embryo transfers in Australia. That study also found a decrease in the chances of a live birth associated with higher levels of air pollution.\nAlso Read: Cancer Vaccine Is ready!

    "text": "A newspaper said, Wall Street Journal The Ukrainian army is currently ordering its forces around 3,000 Russian soldiers trapped near a river in Russia’s Kursk region, in an attempt to deal a new blow to Moscow in the third week of the sudden attack.\nThe newspaper said that Kiev forces used American “Himars” missile systems and drones to overcome floating channels and bridge equipment, while Russia is trying to block its forces between the Sim River and the border of Ukraine.\nThis Ukrainian offensive, which began on August 6, embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Ukrainian forces captured dozens of towns and cities in an area equal to what Russia captured there the total year of attacks in Ukraine, according to the newspaper report.\nThe Ukrainian army is now expanding its control of the border and striking Russian supply lines, while Moscow is increasingly fighting back attacks using bombs and captured forces in from displaced areas of Ukraine and other parts of Russia.\nA fatal mistake by a general and a “loophole” again… How did Ukraine join Russia?\nThe sudden Ukrainian attack inside the Russian territory revealed the tactical deficiencies of the Russian military base and the way of making field decisions.\nThis attack has not yet changed the dynamics of the main battlegrounds in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is advancing towards Pokrovsk, a key supply hub for Ukraine, and Turistich , a strategically important city.\nCivilians flee Pokrovsk, Ukraine, as Russian army advances\nResidents of Pokrovsk fled on Wednesday, as Russian forces continued to move towards this important logistics node in eastern Ukraine, despite the attack by Kiev floated in the Russian border region of Kursk.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine used drones to attack an airbase in Russia’s Volgograd region as part of its campaign for long-range attacks.\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said it responded to drone attacks in five other regions overnight.\nIn Kursk, Ukraine is widening the scope of its attack rather than making deep breakthroughs that are easily breached, according to Mick Ryan, a military strategist and retired major general in the Australian army. in an interview with the American newspaper.\nThe Ukrainian army in Kursk aims to control the most defensible territory near Ukraine, making it easier to support.\n“dilemma” This approach puts Putin in front of a major dilemma, according to the newspaper, because trying to remove Ukrainian forces would require the withdrawal of large forces from Ukraine, which would weaken the continued attacks of the Russia against strategic targets in the east and that allows the Ukrainians to take advantage of the gaps. and get the land back.\nSo far, it appears that Russia is largely moving forces from reserves and regions in Ukraine where fighting is not intense, such as the south and northeast.\nThere are those who believe that it is prudent for Russia to monitor the situation and slow down the progress of the Ukrainians by sending just enough troops.\nFor Russia, regaining control of the entire Kursk region may be a secondary goal compared to the strategic goal of advancing into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. , which Putin has declared as part of Russia.\nMoscow recruits about 25,000 men a month, but is suffering from a shortage of experienced soldiers needed to push the Ukrainians out.\nSo far, “Moscow is not very concerned about the situation in Kursk,” according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Center on Russia and Eurasia.\nStanovaya, who spoke to the Wall Street Journal, believes that Putin sees the Ukraine invasion as having a limited impact on his broader strategic calculus, which aims to control Donetsk and finally influencing the government of Ukraine to create conditions for negotiations that are in Russia. interest\nShe said that the Russian army does not want to be drawn into a costly attack in Kursk that may require the scorched earth strategy that has been applied in Ukrainian cities such as Avdiivka and Bakhmut to use.\n“blow” But the Ukraine operation dealt a blow to Putin’s promise that the war, which he calls a “special military operation,” would remain limited to Ukraine and not affect the lives of ordinary Russians.\nSome Ukrainian military leaders have long argued that making Russians feel wary should be a key part of Kiev’s strategy, as it puts pressure on Putin to end the war\nThe commander of a Ukrainian drone battalion with the code name “Kold” told the newspaper in this regard: “We want to bring war to their territory​​​​”.\nCold drone units were among the first forces to enter Kursk, and are now stationed in the basements of houses north of Sudja, where they will use their reconnaissance and attack aircraft to target the forces of the to help Ukraine move forward.\nAfter the “Ukrainian invasion”… Russia begins preparing “shelters” in the Kursk region\nThe acting governor of the Kursk region in western Russia, Alexei Smirnov, said on Thursday that Russian authorities have begun installing concrete shelters in the region in an effort to protect civilians in the wake of the ongoing Ukrainian offensive.\nCold explained that Russia is fighting hard. Earlier this week, they sent a force of 80 soldiers to one of the Ukrainian towns involved, and before the attack, dropped 21 cluster bombs on the town in an hour, making it difficult for The Ukrainians repelled the attack.\nHe pointed out that the deployed Russian forces are well equipped and have extensive combat experience, as they successfully used electronic warfare systems to shoot down some of his unit’s planes .\nHe revealed that Russian troops, whose movements he is monitoring via drone screens, are currently digging trenches and installing defensive positions along the new front line, indicating they are expecting a long campaign.\nThe biggest attack The increase in Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian regions coincides with an increase in attacks on military airports to prevent Russia from using them to launch drones and fighters.\nLast week, Ukraine launched what an official said was the largest drone attack on Russian military airfields since the start of the war, targeting airports in Voronezh, Kursk, Savaslykha and Borisoglebsk.\nDrones, which are locally produced and are considered cheaper and more accessible than cruise missiles, have been able to circumvent political restrictions placed on the use of weapons provided by Western allies in attacks inside Russian territory.\nIn addition, Ukraine targeted Russian oil refineries using its drones.\nIn Sumy, a city located in the Ukrainian border region with Kursk, military roads are lined with vehicles used to transport supplies into Kursk, including food and fuel for the soldiers.\nElectricity generators are also being brought in due to damage to infrastructure in the Kursk region, which caused a power outage there.\nAs the Russians assemble pontoon bridges to try to cross the Sim River, the Ukrainians continue to destroy them with artillery.\nBut Ukrainian troops believe that these moves will not succeed in cutting off the besieged Russian forces from their supply lines near the Sim River.\nA Ukrainian commander, with the name Croat, told the newspaper: “Now that we have destroyed three of their bridges, it is only a matter of time before the fort closes in on them.”\n#long #battle #ahead #Ukraine #moving #surround #Russian #forces #Kursk\n2024-08-22 23:47:46",

    "title": "Pikes Peak Children’s Museum to begin new year without a home",
    "text": "The Pikes Peak Children’s Museum, a nonprofit run in Colorado Springs since 2005, is homeless once again.\nThe museum operated at 2565 Airport Road, a storefront in a strip mall in the city’s southeast quadrant, until late July when the organization’s lease expired, will enter 2024 without a brick-and-mortar location.\nThe president of the\nPikes Peak Children's Museum, Catherine Roosevelt, a mother of two, said the organization declined to renew its lease because of rising rental costs and safety concerns with the locale.\n“It was never meant to be a permanent spot and rent was holding us back from making investments and changes,” Roosevelt said after the closure.\nWithout a location or rent, some of those changes included running intermittent pop-up events and in-school field trips while hiring a marketing team to redo the nonprofit's website, helping augment the museum's pool of volunteer staff.\nMeanwhile, Roosevelt said she is not giving up on a permanent location.\n“We saw a need for space,” Roosevelt said. “I put my career aside to get this space going in our community so that kids could have a safe place to grow and play and learn but also a place for parents to go and have their cup of coffee.”\nIn the search for a permanent location the problem is a simple one — money. The solution is much trickier, Roosevelt said.\nIn researching how other cities funded children's museums, Roosevelt said it often came down to finding wealthy donors or a shift in political and bureaucratic inertia.\n“Museums are not a great business model,” Roosevelt said. “They don't tend to be profitable.”\nIn July 2021, a year after the opening of U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum in downtown Colorado Springs, the museum operated with at least a $1 million deficit, The Gazette previously reported. Then in July 2022, under new leadership, museum staff said they ended the year in black but still owed long-term debt.\nUnlike the Olympic museum, Roosevelt said the Pikes Peak Children’s Museum would cater more to local families with young children than tourists. Seventy miles north in Denver, Colorado's Springs' larger counterpart sustains a museum of a similar stripe.\nThe\nDenver Children's Museum's 47,000-square-foot facility located on a 10.5-acre plot downtown has thrived for decades. According to museum staff, its revenue model consists of visitor admission fees, a membership program, donations, fundraising events, grants, corporate sponsorships as well as income from the museums café and gift shop.\nThe museum also benefits from being a part of Denver's Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (\nSCFD), a unique sales tax within Denver's seven-county metro area that devotes 1 cent on every $10 spent to fund cultural organizations including the Children's Museum.\nBut that's not the case in Colorado Springs. Instead, Roosevelt is grassroots fundraising with events such as the organization's\nNoon Year’s Eve balloon drop. Roosevelt said she faced pushback from families after the museum added an attendance fee instead of making the event donation optional.\n[\nBuild it and employees will come, developers say of 36-story apartment tower in downtown Colorado Springs](/premium/build-it-and-employees-will-come-developers-say-of-36-story-apartment-tower-in-downtown/article_a3a212fa-83f2-11ee-a7c8-5ba24fd1d882.html)\n“Please understand families make choices like this all the time,”\nFacebook user Brooke McCarty commented on the museums' event posting. “Would I rather spend $50 for a 2-hour event per person or save that money for season passes to the North Pole for right around the same amount per person?”\nAs a parent, Roosevelt said she realizes families with young children who would frequent the museum are often penny pinching. That's why Roosevelt has been trying to expand the museum's network of connection with politicians, other nonprofits and community leaders.\nJariah Walker, Executive Director of the Colorado Springs Urban Renewal Authority, met with Roosevelt about a future home for the museum, but said no urban renewal project has been established.\n“It would be something that I’m sure the board would have an interest with,” Walker said.\nHe noted that such a proposal must be well-planned because upon its approval a 25-year clock begins for that project to collect tax reimbursement as it generates sales or property tax revenue, which is not the character of a nonprofit, Walker said, rather a business.\nIn the meantime, Roosevelt said she will keep searching for Pikes Peak Children’s Museum's long-term home.",

Pero en cuestión de, escribiendo las canciones. Lleva mucho más tiempo y lo que puedo enseñarte del disco es que es muy fácil de escuchar. Me gusta porque tiene algo especial, todo lo que aprendo y vivo, alguna etapa de mi vida. Hice muchas cosas distintas en el estudio y creo que será mi disco favorito\", expresó el artista en Spotify.\n¿Qué colaboraciones tendrá el nuevo álbum?\nSe esperan artistas de talla mundial en este producto que trae Bad Bunny para el arranque de 2025.
