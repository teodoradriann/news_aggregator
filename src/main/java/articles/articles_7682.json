    "text": "灰瓦白墙，具有典型的豫东古建筑风格，在神火大道与团结路交叉口西南角的这处公共厕所完成升级改造之后，给人眼前一亮的感觉。3月12日，记者发现，该公共厕所升级改造之后，不但大幅度增加了厕间，而且还提升了多方面的设施，让广大市民方便的事情变得更加方便了。\n“这处公共厕所升级改造完成后，如同一处好看的古建筑。”家住附近的居民马涛说，升级后的公共厕所厕间增加了不少，可以更好地满足市民如厕的需求。\n记者看到，这处公共厕所不但外观更加美观，而且在功能上也更加贴近民生。以往设置在厕间内的洗手池有了单独的盥洗间，而且考虑到儿童洗手的需求，洗手池分为高低不同的标准，更好地关爱了儿童。\n“以前这里的公共厕所建于2013年，已经投入十多年，主体结构腐蚀、损坏严重，地面塌陷，安全隐患较大，已无维修价值。”梁园区城市管理局环境卫生事务中心公厕管理东站西片区片长张靖昊说，为了更好地服务市民，提升公共厕所设施，对该处和附近步行街的另外一处公共厕所重新建设，“新建设的公共厕所不但扩大了一倍厕间，而且在外观、内部洁具、绿化等方面均有提升及体现，此外还具有儿童友好、残疾人无障碍等方面的考量。”\n记者了解到，按照2024年省、市重点民生实事任务清单，梁园区城市管理局在公共厕所管理方面，已翻新修缮老旧公共厕所100处，整体提升公共厕所25处，迁移公共厕所2处，新建公共厕所1处。结合城市发展总体规划及广大市民对于公共厕所的需求，该局以公共厕所补建、提档升级为重点，拓展公共厕所文化等多种功能，打造地标式城市新名片，彻底颠覆人们对公共厕所脏、臭、差的旧思想观念，不仅有效缓解了群众“如厕难”问题，更通过技术创新与制度完善的双轮驱动，探索出城市公共服务提质增效的新路径。\n来源：商丘日报",
