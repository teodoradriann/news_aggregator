Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST IPSWICH, England :Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter both scored to end Brighton & Hove Albion's run of eight Premier League games without a win as their side beat Ipswich Town 2-0 at Portman Road on Thursday.\nThe victory lifts Brighton to ninth place on 31 points, while Ipswich slip to 17th on 16 and back into the relegation zone behind Wolverhampton Wanderers on goals scored.\nThe hosts started well despite Brighton enjoying plenty of possession and Nathan Broadhead created the first decent chance of the game for Ipswich with a shot from outside the box but Bart Verbruggen got down to steer the ball behind for a corner.\nFive minutes later striker Liam Delap had a go from a similar position but again the Brighton goalkeeper was equal to the task and the Dutchman had to be on his toes again when midfielder Omari Hutchinson let fly just before the break.\nIpswich fullback Wes Burns flashed a shot just wide after a well-worked long throw in the 57th minute but the home side's failure to take their chances finally cost them dear two minutes later when Mitoma struck.\nA sliced clearance fell to Swedish midfielder Yasin Ayari and he cleverly fed Matt O’Riley, who teed up the Japanese winger for a first-time finish.\nWith Ipswich reeling, keeper Christian Walton got a measure of revenge on Brighton's Joao Pedro, who got a yellow card for clattering into him early in the second half, by making a superb save to prevent his 67th-minute shot flying into the top corner.\nBrighton were not to be denied, however, and substitute Rutter fired home form close range in the 82nd to wrap up the three points and end the visitors' long winless run.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "Ariana Grande lookalike Paige Niemann has sparked concerns about her petite frame – and was accused of drastically losing weight to keep up with the singer.\nIn a recent video shared to her TikTok page, the 20-year-old internet personality and OnlyFans creator dressed up as Ariana’s Wicked character Glinda from Jon M. Chu’s recently released film adaptation of the Broadway musical.\nPaige played the role of the star in a pink and white striped button-up dress and a pink ruffled shirt in sync with the production’s famous hit, What Is This Feeling?\nAlthough it appeared to be just an innocent upload, alarm bells sounded for some of her followers.\nMany people on the\nOne viewer wrote: ‘The fact that she has gone to such lengths to continue losing weight [to look] like Ari is so messed up…put her in jail.”\nAnother agreed, adding, “Yes, I’m so glad someone finally talked about it because the weight loss part? Why? Like losing weight to look like Ari? Hello?’\n“She needs help,” said a third.\nAriana Grande lookalike Paige Niemann has sparked concerns about her petite body – and was accused of drastically losing weight to keep up with the singer\nPeople on X wondered if she lost weight so she could look like Ariana (seen earlier this month)\nEchoing a similar sentiment, a fourth user posted: ‘I swear this is so worrying…’\nA fifth wrote: ‘I don’t want to assume she did, but without a doubt she looks exactly like Ariana in every style phase she’s gone through, right down to a similar weight and appearance. It’s really about behavior.’\nOthers, however, couldn’t get past how much Paige looked like Ariana.\n“The fact that this isn’t Ariana Grande is scary,” one said, while another commented, “Wait, so this isn’t Ariana Grande?”\nAriana doppelgänger Paige was first compared to the chart-topper in her schoolyard when she was just 10 years old.\nFour years and a million TikTok followers later, the striking brunette found her own fame online in 2014 thanks to their uncanny resemblance.\nIn 2019, the California native said that after asking her mother to do her hair and makeup like the God Is A Woman singer, she started learning the beauty tricks herself.\nAnd the more she posted on Instagram, the more she caught the attention of Ariana fans around the world.\nPaige dressed up as Ariana’s Wicked character Glinda in a recent video shared to TikTok\nMany people took to the X, formerly Twitter, to share their concerns about her thin physique\nBut Ariana may not be a fan, as she once called people who imitate her’ bizarre.’\nThe former Nickelodeon star has raised concerns about her small figure in recent months.\nEarlier this month, she fought back tears when a French influencer and journalist asked her how she “deals” with criticism of her appearance and beauty standards in general.\nAriana said she has been dealing with the “noise” since she was a teenager.\nShe added that she has since learned to shut out the critics by leaning on her work and friends.\n‘I’ve been doing this for the public… a specimen in a petri dish actually since I was 16 or 17. So I heard it all,” she said.\n“I’ve heard every version of what’s wrong with me. And then you fix it and then it’s wrong for different reasons, but that’s everything, from even the simple thing: your appearance, you’re young and you hear all those things.\n‘It’s hard to protect yourself from that noise. And it’s something that’s uncomfortable no matter what scale you experience it on.\nThe former Nickelodeon star has raised concerns about her small figure in recent months\nIn 2020, California native Paige, left, used Ariana’s Bring It On costume, right, as inspiration for a look\n“Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone’s grandma says, ‘Oh my God, you look skinnier! What happened?’ or, “You look heavier! What happened?” That is something that is uncomfortable and terrible wherever it happens, whatever scale it happens. I think there is a comfort in today’s society that we shouldn’t have at all.\n“Commenting on appearance, other people’s appearance, what they think is happening behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves… from what you wear, to your body, to your face, to everything. ‘\nShe defiantly called the “comfort” people have with “commenting” on people’s appearance “dangerous.”\n‘There’s a reassurance that people are commenting on that, which I think is really dangerous. And I think it’s dangerous for all parties involved,” she said.",

    "text": "Christmas cheer has deserted the streets of Syria’s cities, where the main churches have limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with Palestinians suffering war in Gaza. “In Palestine, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, people are suffering,” the Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, Mor Dionysius Antoine Shahda, told AFP. The northern Syrian city’s central district of Azizia is usually home to a bustling festive market and a huge Christmas tree, while its streets are adorned with lights and trinkets. But this year, the main square is almost empty and there are no Christmas decorations in sight. “In Syria we cancelled all official celebrations and receptions in our churches in solidarity with the victims of the bombing on Gaza” by Israeli forces, Shahda said. The Syriac Catholic Church was not alone, with the leaders of three of Syria’s major churches — the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic patriarchs — announcing they were cancelling Christmas festivities and limiting celebrations to religious ceremonies. “Given the current circumstances, especially in Gaza, the patriarchs apologise for not receiving Christmas and New Year greetings,” the trio said in a joint statement, adding they were limiting ceremonies to “prayers”. The health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory says more than 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its massive air and ground offensive, in response to a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7. Most of the dead in Gaza are women and children, officials say. The Hamas attack killed about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Many Gazans have been displaced by the violence and forced into crowded shelters or tents, often struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical care. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said the ongoing Israeli military campaign left no safe place anywhere across the narrow territory. ‘No opportunity for joy’ Before Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, it was home to more than 1.2 million Christians, though huge numbers have fled since. The conflict had dampened Christmas celebrations, but festivities picked up in recent years as the main front lines froze and government forces retook control of large swathes of the country. Still, gloom now prevails in the streets of the capital Damascus. Festivities are limited to a lone market, while the Greek Orthodox Mariamite Cathedral in Damascus has put up modest decorations and a small tree in its courtyard. Damascus resident Rachel Haddad, 66, said she had been glued to her phone for more than two months, reading news of the devastation in Gaza, and did not have the heart to put up a Christmas tree. “This year was very sad. It began with the earthquake and ended with the Gaza war,” Haddad said, referring to the February 6 tremor that ripped through southern Turkey and Syria, killing at least 55,000 people. “There was no opportunity for joy,” she said, also blaming Syria’s economic woes. The country’s economy has been battered by war, with recurrent fuel shortages and long, daily power cuts a fact of life. “If there is no electricity, how will you see the decorations and lights anyway?” Haddad asked.",

El tema de la 'ocupación' (que no es tal), si no el 'desalojo' es lo problemático si no hay una vivienda social alternativa donde meter al moroso. El derecho a techo está por encima del derecho a hacer negocio, es el problema de montar tu negocio en base a servicios básicos. Y sí, la solución es construir viviendas públicas de alquiler, cosa que ningún gobierno hace, así que muy de izquierdas no serán.\n[#291](c291#c-291) no el resto.\nNo espero que todo el mundo lo haga.\nYo estoy lo deseo sobretodo por egoísmo. No quiero trabajar con gente que ponga trabas para tener una vida fácil en el trabajo y que \" no les mareé\".\nLos que cambian el mundo para mejor quieren cambiar las cosas no solo que les paguen bien.\nObviamente, en este sistema en el que estamos, quiero que me paguen bien por mi trabajo. Pero, fijate, para eso lo que hago es elegir trabajar en la industria que me pague más, no en la que creo que podría hacer mejores cosas.\nVes lo de digo?\n[#156](c156#c-156) Se presupone que alguien con 27 viviendas tiene dinero suficiente para hacer los arreglos pertinentes. El tío simplemente es un jeta y un aprovechado. A mí no me da ninguna pena que le salgan inquilinos morosos a este tipo de gente.\n[#244](c244#c-244) \". ¿Quién va a construirte una red de carreteras, una red eléctrica, o un sistema de suministro de agua si vives en un chalet aislado en un pueblo y quieren cobrar?. La respuesta es nadie, el Estado tiene que facilitarlo\"\nPues nadie, si has construido y no tienes servicios cerca, te aguantas, te lo pagas tu si quieres.\n\"porque te aseguro que las sociedades donde la gente vive en casas y no en chabolas funcionan mejor\"\nen donde viven en chabolas que no me he enterado? en paris?, londres? ny? berlin? madrid?\n\"pero no se hace porque esto es un sistema de extracción de renta de las clases bajas a los grandes inversores en vivienda.\"\npues juntante tu con muchos que quieran comprar, montais cooperativa, y listo, ya teneis la vivienda, que facil no?\nQue se haga cargo a quien le corresponda de la situcion de esta familia. Lo que nonpuede ser es que se pretenda que una persona regale sus propiedades para que otros vivan y se lucren(no paguen)\nTampoco puede ser que una familia sin recursos tenga tropocientos hijos como si fueran una gallina ponedora.",

    "text": "REGINA - Paramedics rush to the call of those most in need, providing care, support and transportation to medical centres. One of those paramedics is Jenna Davis, who broke down what preparing for the day is like. “We come in the morning. It's usually nice and early. We get our trucks ready, but as soon as we put in our radio and log on to our MBT in our units, we're logged on, and we're ready to go so our dispatch can see that we're ready, And we're ready for a call from right from the start of our 12-hour shift.” Davis said the number of calls they receive daily can vary between 3 and 11 for a unit. Davis became a paramedic to help the vulnerable and sick. While the job can feel rewarding, it does come with its challenges. Paramedics question what they could have done better or if they could have done something differently during a call. There can be a feeling of guilt at times after a call, said Davis. She added paramedics need to know when to put their safety first before a patient, no matter what is happening, as they are taught to do. Davis recalled a time she received a call to help out a person. Davis felt she needed to step away from the person rather than approach them. She was thankful to do so because that patient was unstable. Davis also alluded to the rise in violent cases paramedics are responding to. These challenges can impact a paramedic's personal life, which Davis said they try to avoid, but it’s not always possible. That’s why there’s an organization called Paramedics with Heart, which focuses on enhancing the quality of life for those in the field. Davis, the president of Paramedics with Heart, talked about their goals. \"We're trying to change the culture within EMS. We're trying to change it as we are here to help you, and your mental health does matter, and if you want, we're here to support you.\" Paramedics with Heart remembers every year a long-time paramedic, Robbie Curtis, who died from a battle with PTSD. Davis said sometimes a job or incident can slip through the cracks and cause a first responder to go through PTSD. The organization is trying to change the narrative of paramedics having to be tough for their job. Davis wants paramedics to be open and talk about their calls. Paramedics with Heart and the Robbie Curtis family have put together a scholarship for an individual studying to become a paramedic. The individuals have to be enrolled in Sask. Polytechnic and write an essay on a medical topic. The winner is decided based on who shares the same commitment to the field as Curtis did. The scholarship awards the winner $2,000 towards their education costs. While Paramedics with Heart focuses on current paramedics, they also educate people regarding the job. Davis said people can see paramedics as \"ambulance drivers.\" So, they showcase what paramedics can do to change people's minds about them and get them interested in working in the field. For those interested in the field, Davis recommended doing a ride-along with the EMS and seeing what it is like. She added not everything is going to be a life-threatening emergency, but typically, paramedics deal with sick people. As for Davis, she is going to continue working with paramedics and organizations to ensure the first responders get the support they need.",
