    "text": "Weekend Getaways\n9 Hotels for an Epic Weekend Getaway in EuropeBy Jessica Benavides Canepa\nFor many travelers, an ideal weekend getaway includes a mix of activities and relaxation. Some are drawn to cultural or adventure outings; for others, the perfect mini-break is lounging poolside with a good book. The key is selecting a hotel that caters to your particular needs while offering a variety of local experiences that enhance your stay.\nHere’s a selection of European hotels in the center of it all that will turn your weekend escape into a lifetime of memories. As always, check for travel guidelines and closures before planning your trip.\nThe Marmorosch Bucharest, Autograph Collection in Romania\nBucharest’s historic Old Town is filled with ancient treasures. Visitors can view artifacts at the National Museum of Romanian History; explore Curtea Veche, where Vlad the Impaler once ruled from; or behold the architectural beauty of Carturesti Carusel, a 19th-century bank-turned-bookshop. The Marmorosch Bucharest, Autograph Collection is a storied structure in its own right, with a history dating back to the Belle Epoque era. With ornate details like stained glass, wood paneling and marble tile, the property’s dazzling design preserves its heritage as a 1912 bank.\nThe vintage theme continues in the evening with period-inspired French cuisine at\nBlank restaurant and cocktails at The Vault, a speakeasy-style bar set in the building’s original vault.\nThe hotel is a quick stroll from Bucharest’s old-world attractions, and you can also coordinate visits to other notable sites like Transylvania’s\nBran Castle, the castle that inspired Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.”\nW Ibiza in Spain\nSanta Eulalia, a resort town with sleepier vibes than party-loving Ibiza Town, offers travelers a restful respite by the sea.\nAttractions of note include the 16th-century Puig de Missa church, a scenic promenade and a yacht-filled port.\nOn the south end of town,\nW Ibiza offers direct access to the Santa Eulalia promenade and is a short walk to the beach. Enjoy peace-inducing views of the Mediterranean Sea from the ground-floor Wet DECK pool area and the adults-only Glow – Rooftop with an infinity pool.\nThe guest rooms and suites have a relaxed, beachy vibe. Guests can continue the laid-back feel with in-suite AWAY Spa services, 24/7 FIT gym access, and alfresco meals and drinks while the sun sets.\nMoxy Athens City in Greece\nFor travelers who enjoy staying in charmingly quirky surrounds,\nMoxy Athens City provides urban artwork, clever signage, American-style eateries and sensational views of the Acropolis.\nAnd with proximity to\ncity attractions like neighboring old town Plaka, a villagelike district with cobbled streets lined with small shops and sidewalk cafés; local nightlife; and public transportation that takes visitors to major archeological sites, your weekend will surely be a well-rounded adventure.\nParagraph Freedom Square, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Tbilisi in Georgia\nFor a scenic outing through Tbilisi’s yesteryear, start your quest at\nParagraph Freedom Square, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Tbilisi, which fronts its namesake square, the oldest in Georgia. From here, you can stroll to the Georgian National Museum or the Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, in minutes.\nWhen you’ve had your fill of Tbilisi’s treasures, indulge in a massage or swim in the heated indoor pool at\nParagraph Spa, the hotel’s luxe, expansive, three-floor spa. At meal times, try the international menu at Ostigan, or stop for a bite and a spectacular skyline view of the city at Chinari Bar & Lounge.\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa in Malta\nIf a weekend of seaside cosmopolitan living is your dream, head to\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa. Located in St. Julian’s, just north of the capital city of Valletta, the hotel invites visitors to a leisurely escape surrounded by art nouveau architecture and overlooking the clear waters of tiny Balluta Bay.\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa has everything you need for a short holiday in the sun, from the hotel’s three pools (including an indoor spa option) to its\nfive on-site restaurants (four of which offer outdoor dining). Plus, you can easily reach Balluta Bay Beach via a promenade.\nWhen you’re ready to adventure further, explore St. Julian’s lively food and nightclub scene, venture to Valletta to dig into the area’s history and culture, or book a sailboat excursion around the Maltese Islands.\nSheraton Lisboa Hotel & Spa in Portugal\nLocated in the city center, the\nSheraton Lisboa Hotel & Spa provides an ideal base for discovering Lisbon’s best offerings. Tour the hilly streets of the Alfama district and listen to melancholic Fado music. Venture to Bairro Alto for gourmet eats and unusual wares. Or walk around the always-buzzy Praca do Comercio square.\nAfter a rejuvenating dip in the sparkling outdoor pool, relive the day’s journey from the\nhotel’s rooftop, which has panoramic views over the city and Tagus River.\nW Edinburgh in Scotland\nWith plenty of\nhistoric sites to visit, green spaces to explore, traditional food to try and much more, Edinburgh is a wonderful destination for a long weekend. The city is also very walkable — and from W Edinburgh, you can explore the UNESCO World Heritage Old and New Towns.\nIf shopping is among your favorite weekend activities, you’ll find items for all tastes at the centrally located\nSt. James Quarter, boasting 80 stores, a collection of international eateries, and fun activities like crazy golf and bowling. And a stay at W Edinburgh, situated inside the galleria, puts you at the center of it all.\nAfter a day of exploring and shopping, indulge in spa treatments at\nAWAY Spa and grab a bite to eat at in-house Sushisamba, a restaurant specializing in Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian flavors.\nDorothea Hotel, Budapest, Autograph Collection in Hungary\nIf spa lounging is more your speed, book a weekend at\nDorothea Hotel, Budapest, Autograph Collection, and kick back in the heated, 49-foot-long spa pool alongside a sleek, dark marble wall. The hotel also has a sizable gym, steam room, sauna and spa treatment spaces to level up your relaxation.\nBudapest is home to a host of soothing thermal baths, each offering a tranquil experience. For views over the Danube River, head to the\nLukacs Baths, a short drive from Dorothea Hotel. Some, including the oldest bath house in Europe, Szechenyi Baths, host nighttime “sparties” complete with music and drinks.\nOrtea Palace Hotel, Sicily, Autograph Collection in Italy\nHistory buffs will appreciate the thoughtful design behind\nOrtea Palace Hotel, Sicily, Autograph Collection in Italy. The former 1920s post office was reinvented as a hotel that honors the history of the building — and it’s a befitting base for exploring archeological sites in Syracuse, a city famed for its ancient relics.\nFrom the hotel, visit many fascinating finds, including the rock-embedded tombs at the Necropolis of Pantalica, the fifth-century B.C. Temple of Athena and the Neapolis Archeological Park, where travelers can behold the remnants of a Roman amphitheater.\nDuring your stay at Ortea Palace, Autograph Collection, be sure to savor Mediterranean dishes at\nIl Cortile, the hotel’s on-site restaurant, and reserve time at the Ortea Spa’s mosaic-tiled indoor pool to complete your weekend getaway.",

    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY: Strong to severe storms possible into the nighttime hours SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - Happy Thursday! It’s a KSLA First Alert Weather Day once again today due to the threat for strong to severe storms in the ArkLaTex this evening. After seeing temperatures reach the 90s again in some locations, and the dew point remaining out of control, we will likely deal with strong to severe storms, on a more widespread basis, across the region. The timing of the storms, unfortunately, coincides with the evening rush hours. Storms look to begin moving into the region around 5 or 6 PM and continue moving through the region into the 10 and 11 PM hours. The main threats are similar to yesterday with damaging wind and large hail being the main priorities along with a chance for isolated tornadoes. According to the latest data, storms look to be mostly over with by around midnight. Tomorrow, a nice and quiet day, will start off in the 60s for the first time I believe this week. We’re looking at plenty of sunshine and lower humidity as temperatures rise into the lower to mid-80s. Saturday will be similar with a little more cloud cover and a slight chance for showers late Saturday night. Sunday sees a more widespread shower chance with highs in the upper 70s and lower 80s. Nothing severe is expected. More rain and storm chances for next week as temperatures rise back into the mid-80s. Copyright 2024 KSLA. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Mysterious morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy.\nThe FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels.\n“The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance.\nEven then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.”\nPeople are also reading…\nJon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms.\nAaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said.\nMany highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms.\nParker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels.\n“They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said.\nAccording to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked.\nThe North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported.\nMarian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.”\nHeather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi.\nMushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died.\nBefore the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.”\nThe FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert.\nThe study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication.\nThe study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms.\nHallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs.\nIn the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said.\nThere hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",
