    "title": "Male U18 AAA Selects pick up key wins in quest for 7th place – The Carillon",
    "text": "Male U18 AAA Selects pick up key wins in quest for 7th place Advertisement The Eastman Selects male U18 team knows they have to avoid eighth place this year. It’s a flat year in the standings in the Manitoba AAA Hockey League, aside from the number one Brandon Wheat Kings, which have yet to lose in regulation this season. If the playoffs were to start today, Eastman would be forced to take on the juggernaut squad from Brandon, a fate the team is eager to avoid. The Selects quest to climb into seventh place got a big boost this past weekend, as the team managed to beat two teams ahead of them in the standings, defeating the seventh-place Pembina Valley Hawks 4-3 in a shootout Jan. 5, then returning to Beausejour the next day and taking down the fifth-place Winnipeg Wild 3-1. Head coach Bruce Sirrell said the team has come out of the holiday break strong, including one of their best performances of the season against the Wild. “It was all four lines, three pairs and we got sharp goaltending from Sammy (Fontaine) again,” Sirrell said. “I’m hoping we’re turning the corner. That’s two in a row for us, so we have to build on that.” The key point of the game came in the waning moments of the second period. Despite a strong first period, with Selects only give up three shots, they could only manage a 2-0 lead. Late in the second Branden Watson brought the Wild to within one, beating Fontaine on a two-on-one break. What followed was 30 seconds of pure domination from Eastman, capped off with a Jeremiah Warkentine goal. Warkentine received a pass from below the goal-line after his teammates won multiple puck battles, and made no mistake, restoring the Selects two-goal lead. Sirrell said Warkentine’s marker changed the tone of the rest of the contest. “That line with (Calem) Normandeau, Warkentine and Gags (Mario Gagnon) was phenomenal all game, I think they spent the entire night in (the offensive) end,” Sirrell said, noting the line was together to start the season, but injuries and other moves had separated them as of late. “We were finally able to get that line back together, and man, they dominate shifts. The 3-1 final would hold, as both teams were held scoreless in the third period. Only four points separate the Hawks and 10th-place Parkland Rangers this season. That seventh slot could be valuable for Eastman in particular, as the Selects have defeated the Southwest Cougars (currently the second place team) twice this season. “Outside of Brandon, everybody seems to be beating everybody,” Sirrell said. “Some of the higher teams have been coming back a bit. It’s a tough league. We just got to make sure we don’t take anything for granted.” Sirrell has his team aiming high in 2024, guessing they’ll need to win seven out of every 10 games they play to climb up the standings. A change of the team’s systems is driving those high expectations, as the Selects look to generate more goals as the season wears on. “We’re giving our players a little bit more opportunity to make reads, and if they we’re going to get the puck we’re flying the zone early,” Sirrell said. “We’re a fast team, and I think we were kind of bogged down… We changed a few things around, took the seatbelt off some guys and allow them to make those reads without any repercussions on the bench.” This weekend’s action will have massive implications on the rest of Eastman’s season, as the team travels to Thompson for a back-to-back against the Norman Wolves, who sit just two points back of the Selects. “Hopefully we can bring this same focus, and get four points out of there,” Sirrell said. “A split’s a split, but we need to get something out of that trip.” The male U18 selects play out of Beausejour, with their games broadcast on FloHockey.tv. The AAA regular season for Eastman is set to finish Feb. 25.",

    "title": "Monte Morris finding his offensive aggression with Timberwolves – Twin Cities",
    "text": "Timberwolves coach Chris Finch saw a clear silver lining in Mike Conley sitting out Wednesday’s win over Toronto, beyond the 36-year-old getting some well-deserved rest. Conley’s absence meant more run for Monte Morris. Conley is obviously the floor general for the Timberwolves. And Jordan McLaughlin’s emergence has created a few lineup combinations Finch simply has to get to on a nightly basis. That’s meant fewer minutes for Morris, who has been very good since his trade deadline acquisition. “He’s been playing great, but just the opportunity hasn’t been there,” Finch said. “So just getting him out there with different guys, it was good to see.” And Morris took full advantage. In 25 minutes, Morris finished with 13 points — on the strength of three triples — five assists, four rebounds, two blocks and a steal. The Wolves outscored Toronto by 30 points when the veteran point guard was in the game. It was exactly the type of performance the Wolves wanted to see from a guard they know they’ll need at the end of the regular season and beyond. Finch has noted on countless occasions that the Timberwolves need “low-usage, high-impact guys” to fill out their talented roster. Players who don’t need the ball in their hands, but when they get it, they’ll make something happen. If anything, Finch would like to see Morris be more aggressive with his offense early in possessions. Morris is still finding the necessary comfort to call his own number. “We’ve got a lot of talented guys, so I’ve got to keep finding ways, little play calls to stay into the flow of the game,” Morris said. “(Wednesday) I called a few. Even if I wasn’t shooting it, it just gave me a feel for the game. Early on, I was deferring a lot and trying to find my way but getting lost in the sauce, just because I wasn’t being aggressive. I’ve got to implement myself more into the game, whether that’s defense, rebounding, things like that. It’s been tough trying to find that flow. But I think I’ve found it a little bit.” It’s not easy to join any team in the middle of a season, let alone one that’s rolling. Morris is used to playing on championship-caliber teams dating back to his days in Denver, but finding ways to insert yourself into something that’s already so good is a challenge. The last thing you want to be is a disruption. “You’re No. 1 (in the West) and you’re coming in to try and find your niche,” Morris said. “It takes time. I just gotta keep trusting everything, keep trusting my work, getting in there every day and just keep working.” Morris said the final six games of the regular season will be “big” for him getting ready for the playoffs. “I know I’ve played in big playoff games, so I know the rhythm you need to be in going into that,” Morris said. “So I have to be more aggressive on that (offensive) end just so when the playoffs do come I’m in good rhythm and ready to go.” His teammates are all for it. “He can really shoot the ball, and we need that,” star guard Anthony Edwards said. “Especially him and J-Mac, they shoot the ball really well. So I just tell him, ‘Trust it. If you open, let it fly. Don’t think about it.’ ” It’s still a work in progress, but Morris is getting there. “I feel like I’m handling it the best way possible. (On Wednesday), Mike didn’t play, so it was an opportunity. I didn’t want the opportunity to slip. I wanted to leave this arena, whether I made or missed shots, just in a better feel and more confident with myself,” Morris said. “I just know being around the league, opportunities don’t come like that a lot. I just wanted to show I’m able to play, when my number is called, a lot more minutes.”",

    "text": "El entrenador de la Selección argentina, Lionel Scaloni, definió que Paulo Dybala y Giovani Lo Celso utilicen los dorsales que dejaron disponibles los ausentes Lionel Messi y Ángel Di María. La Selección nacional enfrentará esta noche a Chile y, ante la ausencia de dichos futbolistas, el DT de la \"Scaloneta\" designó los números que utilizarán los futbolistas y al nuevo capitán, tras no convocar al astro argentino. El emblemático número 10 quedó sin dueño -de forma provisoria-, ya que Messi aún no se recuperó de la lesión que sufrió en la final de la Copa América ante Colombia. En consecuencia, también liberó la capitanía. Lo mismo ocurrió con el dorsal 11 de Di María, ya que el rosarino se retiró de la Selección nacional tras la final que lo convirtió en bicampeón de América. De esta manera, el entrenador decidió que para el encuentro ante Chile, Paulo Dybala tomará el número 10 de Messi, mientras que Giovani Lo Celso heredará la 11 de “Fideo”. Por otra parte, Nicolás Otamendi será el capitán argentino ante la ausencia del jugador de Inter Miami. De esta manera, el experimentado defensor formará parte del equipo titular y liderará al plantel. \"El proceso de elección del capitán es en base al equipo que salga mañana. Es importante que el jugador que lleve la cinta sea alguien con quien el equipo se sienta representado. Tenemos muchos jugadores que así lo hacen\", explicó Scaloni este miércoles en conferencia de prensa. Si bien Otamendi ya la portó en algunas ocasiones, la incertidumbre pasaba por su presencia dentro del equipo inicial, algo que ya quedó despejado. El defensor disputó los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 con la Selección Argentina Sub-23, certamen en el que fue capitán.",

    "title": "Every Woman Prince William Reportedly Dated Before Kate Middleton",
    "text": "Prince William and Kate Middleton are one of the royal family’s most enduring love stories so it is hard to imagine that the future king had any other romantic partner before his now-wife. William and Kate met in college, back in 2001, while studying at St. Andrews University and began a friendship that soon developed into something more. “We were friends for over a year first,” William told People in 2010 after the couple got engaged. “It just sort of blossomed from then on.” They became roommates, with a group of friendship, before embarking on a romance in 2002. “[We] realized we shared the same interests,” William explained. “[We] just had a really good time.” After over two decades together, it is hard to remember a time before Will and Kate. However, if you dig back a little further, there was a time when William was known as a bit of a heartthrob. Despite the Prince and Princess of Wales having a fairytale-esque romance story, it wasn’t all royal jewels and family vacations. It seemed like William would never settle down, but now he and Kate have three kids, a gorgeous home, and are steadily on the path to becoming King and Queen. While a lot of royal relationships can’t be confirmed or denied unless they make an official royal outing, William was linked to quite a few classmates, notable society members and, erm, even a distant cousin (we’ll get to that too…) Check out every woman William has reportedly dated before he and Kate tied the knot in 2011! A version of this article was originally published on Nov 28, 2022. - 1999: Davina Duckworth-Chad Though their alleged fling was never confirmed, William was briefly linked to family friend Davina Duckworth-Chad in 1999. Per the Daily Mail, Duckworth-Chad and William were linked in 1999 after she joined the future king on a cruise ship, dubbed a “love boat” in the Aegean Sea. Not much is known, except for the fact that they’re technically related. According to E! News, her mom is Princess Diana’s cousin. - 2000: Rose Farquhar According to the Daily Mail , William dated his “first love” aspiring singer Rose Farquhar in 2000 after meeting at the Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire. Their relationship reportedly began not long after William finished his A-levels at Eton before his pre-college gap year. Rose is the youngest daughter of Captain Ian Farquhar, who died in 2024, a longtime friend of King Charles who once served as an equerry to Queen Elizabeth’s mother. In the years after their romance, William and Rose reportedly remained friends and Will even attended her 2022 wedding. - 2000-2001: Jecca Craig Jecca Craig and William met back in 1998 in Kenya during a school holiday but reportedly didn’t start dating until 2000 during William’s pre-college gap year. The two split before William headed off to St. Andrews but remained friends, even reuniting briefly on a family trip in 2004 while Kate and Will were allegedly on a break. Their friendship allegedly didn’t go over well with Kate. According to the book Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry, and Meghan, Kate was allegedly tired of being “threatened and humiliated” by her boyfriend and his friendship with his ex and insisted he distance himself from her. - 2001: Arabella Musgrave William and Arabella Musgrave reportedly dated in 2001, during his final summer before going to college. Vanity Fair’s royal correspondent Katie Nicholls reported that the pair, who had known one another peripherally since childhood, connected at a party before embarking on a whirlwind romance. “As she walked through the house party at the van Cutsems’ family home, William did a double take,” Nicholls wrote in 2010 . “They danced and drank into the early hours, and when Arabella said her good-nights, the prince quietly slipped out of the room to follow her upstairs. It was the beginning of a passionate romance, and the two spent as much time together that summer as possible.” The pair reportedly mutually agreed to end their relationship once William’s first semester at St. Andrews began. Musgrave’s went on to become the head of PR at Gucci. - 2001: Carly Massy-Birch Carly Massy-Birch and William were reportedly together for about “six or seven weeks when they first arrived at St Andrews,” per her parents. “I’m a real country bumpkin,” Massy-Birch later said, via Katie Nicholl in Vanity Fair. “I think that was why we had a connection. William was in the year below, and we just happened to meet through the general St. Andrews melee. It’s such a small place that it was impossible not to bump into William, and after a while, there was nothing weird about seeing him around. We got on well, but I think we would have got on well even if nothing had been going on romantically. It was very much a university thing, just a regular university romance.” - 2001: Olivia Hunt William allegedly also dated aspiring writer-now-journalist Olivia Hunt during their first year at St. Andrews. Actually, they were dating right at the time William met Kate, but there was no bad blood. In fact, per https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-448603/The-girl-make-Kate-jealous.htmlthey’re all pretty good friends to this day! - 2003: Bryony Daniels William was briefly linked to fellow St. Andrews student Bryony Daniels in 2003 while the pair were moving in the same social circle. However, when William and Kate’s relationship was first publicized in 2004, it was reported that the couple had been secretly dating for a year so we’re guessing Daniels was never anything more than a friend. - 2004: Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe According to the Daily Mail, William briefly pursued millionaire heiress Isabella Calthorpe in 2004 during a brief break in his romance with Kate. “William said he needed a break and that summer he went on a boys-only holiday to the Greek Islands,” a source alleged . “Isabella was very much on the scene that summer. I would go so far as to say that William dumped Kate because he thought he had a chance with Isabella and Kate knew that.” The source went on to claim that Calthorpe, who is now married to billionaire Richard Branson’s son Sam, rejected William’s advances. “He had fallen for her in a huge way and wanted to be with her. He propositioned her several times that summer and although Isabella was single, she knocked William back and said it would be too damaging for her and her career,” the source claimed, stating that Kate waited for William and took him back on the condition that he never speak to Calthrope again. - 2004: Anna Sloan Royal author Katie Nicholl’s 2010 book William and Harry, via Express UK , Calthorpe wasn’t the only woman William pursued in 2004. Nicholl’s called the break with Kate a “trial separation” that the pair agreed to do before reuniting. During that time, William alleged grew close to American heiress Anna Sloan. However, a romance never blossomed. - 2006: Natasha Hamilton Newspapers had a field day when Natasha Hamilton, an ex-member of the pop group Atomic Kitten, and William looked like they were making out at the Prince’s Trust 30th anniversary concert in 2006. She told the Sun per Female First, “It looks like I’m going in for the kiss. But I really was not. It’s all rather unfortunate. You’ve got to laugh it off.” And that’s all there is to it - 2007: Ana Ferreira After William reportedly dumped Kate Middleton over the phone in 2007, he was seen out partyingwith a woman named Ana Ferreira, per https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8973627/How-William-Kates-relationship-hit-rocks-Prince-weighed-expectation.html. However, they were never seen again and Will and Kate ended up reuniting for good in June 2007.",

In a release, ISRO said the RLV LEX-03 re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions and more severe wind conditions. The winged vehicle, named ‘Pushpak’, was released from an Indian Air Force Chinook Helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 km “from a release point 4.5 km away from the runway. Pushpak autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centreline,” it said. It added that this mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming ISRO’s expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). “Through this mission, the advanced guidance algorithm catering to longitudinal and lateral plane error corrections, which is essential for the future Orbital Re-entry Mission has been validated,” the space agency said.",
