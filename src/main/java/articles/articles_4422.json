    "text": "Beverage distributor offers safe options to avoid drinking and driving on New Year's Eve [Mike Randall](https://www.recordonline.com/staff/5327734002/mike-randall/) GOSHEN - The Orange County Sheriff's Office on Friday urged residents to take advantage of two programs offered by a local beverage distribution company to avoid drinking and driving on New Year's Eve. The sheriff's office said Goshen-based Dana Distributors offers the programs at participating establishments in Orange County and many surrounding counties. The first program, Decide to Ride, is a safe and easy way to get home when you are out and have had too much to drink to safely drive home yourself. Dana has provided participating establishments with a QR code for patrons to scan that will give them credit for an Uber or Lyft ride if they cannot drive home. Overpass removal: [Northbound Thruway in Orange, Ulster counties to close Jan. 6-7](/story/news/2023/12/27/northbound-thruway-to-close-for-overpass-removal-jan-6-7/72038683007/) The other program, Alert Cab, provides a similar service in the areas that Uber and Lyft do not reach: a voucher for a cab ride to return you to your residence. \"We encourage residents to take advantage of this service,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"It can save your life and the lives of those traveling on our roadways. There is no excuse for drinking and driving.\" Mike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

    "text": "Speaking from the podium at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference New York 2024, Columbia student Katie Aryeh is noticeably appalled recounting her experiences at the now infamous Ivy League university.\n“I worked my whole life to get into Columbia and was a very proud student there. And now, I am embarrassed to say that I attended the university. When I went to graduation, 80% of the students were wearing some form of terrorist garb. My fellow students are lining the halls chanting that they are the student intifada.”\nJoined by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) Executive Director Dr. Charles Asher Small and Vice Chair David Harris, the panel explored the disturbing prevalence of support for Hamas from both campus students and faculty.\n“We need a new playbook for the entire community. When it comes to the universities, it needs to be very clear,” David Harris bluntly states, “What they do understand is reputational damage, financial implications, lawfare and congressional legislation.”\nFounded in 2004, ISGAP approaches the subject of antisemitism from a scholarly viewpoint, identifying its origins and manifestations, while promoting excellence in research and developing an accessible socio-scientific understanding of how the contemporary manifestation of this millennia-old phenomenon threatens the Jewish community today. The influence of foreign funding\nSHOULD THE Qataris, who host Hamas leaders and fund the terrorist group with millions of dollars, be trusted? (credit: EVELYN HOCKSTEIN/REUTERS)\nAddressing the influence of foreign funding, particularly from Qatar, ISGAP founder Charles Asher Small explains, “Forty years ago, the Muslim Brotherhood created a strategic plan to distance Israel from the United States and the West and to use antisemitism to fragment and to weaken the United States of America .” This statement is not simply hyperbole but is being played out in real time as we have seen across campuses for months. In order to combat this nefarious strategy employed by foreign agents, Small expounds on the need for the best minds, strategy experts, philanthropists and business leaders to work together and learn from each other.\nThe Jewish nation has never been stronger, more successful, or better educated throughout its history, and Small surmises that ISGAP’s plan of action is to bring the best and brightest together at the table and move forward as a united people.\nBut this daunting task is facing one of the largest and most sophisticated enemies of the Jewish people, as Small shares how campus organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) are direct offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n“The Muslim Brotherhood takes a perversion of Islam, and they fuse it with European Antisemitism. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the words and ideas that led to the extermination of the Jewish people in the Holocaust, are the same words and ideas that the Muslim Brotherhood uses as their raison d’etre,” Small poignantly explains before adding that, “Qatar is funding at least tens of billions of dollars into our higher education, funding the shock troops, the thugs on campus, and they fund our intellectuals.”\n He ironically points out how two generations ago, the Jewish people were facing extermination for being defined as not being white, and yet now Jews are defined by the campus intellectuals, who are disseminating misinformation and falsehoods to the masses of students, as the epitome of white supremacy and settler colonialism.\nIn its efforts to uncover the truth through empirical data and first-hand accounts, Small announced that ISGAP was releasing a new report detailing the rampant antisemitism on Columbia, as reflected by Aryeh, and will continue its work to root out the sources of antisemitism throughout leading elite institutions of higher education.\nISGAP sponsored a portion of the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference 2024. www.jpost.com/AC24",

    "text": "Scientists in Australia and the UK have created ultra-pure silicon to make quantum computers error-free and more stable.\nAccording to scientists from the University of Melbourne and the University of Manchester, using a new technique, engineers have created an ultra-pure silicon that is the perfect material for building large-scale quantum computers.\nThese quantum computers could be revolutionary for humanity and solve problems that would take current technology hundreds of years to solve.\nThe invented material will help scientists overcome the problem of ‘fragile quantum coherence’ faced in building such computers. In this problem, quantum computers make mistakes very quickly, which means they can become unreliable very quickly.\nQuantum bits or qubits are the basis of quantum computers, just like bits in classical computers. However, even minor changes in their environment (such as temperature changes) can affect them. That’s why the quantum computers we have today, kept in refrigerators to keep temperatures low, can only run for fractions of a second without making mistakes.\nDevelopment of new materials will help to overcome this problem. It uses qubits made of phosphorus atoms, which are then embedded in crystals of pure stable silicon, making them even stronger.\n#pure #silicon #quantum #computers #errorfree\n**Interview with Dr. Emily Johnson, Quantum ​Computing Researcher**\n**Interviewer:**⁤ Dr. Johnson, it’s exciting to hear​ about the creation of ultra-pure silicon for quantum computing. How significant is this development for the future of quantum technology?\n**Dr. Johnson:** It’s immensely significant!⁣ This ultra-pure silicon⁣ allows us to create more stable qubits, which is crucial for building reliable quantum computers. ‍The issue of fragile quantum coherence has been a massive hurdle in the field, and this breakthrough⁢ could lead us to achieve‍ error-free computations.\n**Interviewer:** You mentioned ‍stability. Can you explain how this​ new ⁤silicon reduces errors compared‌ to⁢ previous materials?\n**Dr. ‌Johnson:** Certainly! Traditional qubits are incredibly sensitive to ‌their ‍environment, which can cause them to lose coherence quickly. By⁤ using​ phosphorus atoms embedded⁤ in ultra-pure ⁣silicon, we can enhance the strength and stability of qubits, giving them more resilience against environmental factors like temperature changes.\n**Interviewer:** If this technology paves​ the way ⁢for ⁣large-scale quantum‍ computers,⁣ what kind of problems do you foresee ​them ⁤solving that current computers struggle with?\n**Dr. Johnson:**‌ Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields like ‍cryptography, complex simulations ⁣in chemistry,⁤ and ‌optimization problems across various‍ industries. Tasks that would take classical computers centuries to⁣ solve could be completed in mere seconds or minutes‍ with quantum processing.\n**Interviewer:** It sounds intriguing, but there ​must be concerns⁢ about the ethical implications and accessibility of this technology. What are your thoughts?\n**Dr. Johnson:**‍ Absolutely, these‍ are critical discussions we must engage in. As ⁤quantum ‌technology⁣ progresses, ​we need to ensure equitable access ⁤and address‍ potential‍ risks‍ associated with its capabilities, particularly in cryptography and data security. Balancing innovation with⁢ ethical‍ considerations will⁤ be⁤ crucial as we move forward.\n**Interviewer:** Thank⁢ you, Dr. Johnson! This ​brings us to an important question for our readers: what do you think about the balance⁢ between advancing ​quantum ‍technology and ensuring⁤ its⁣ ethical use?⁤ Are we prepared for the‌ potential societal changes it⁤ could‌ bring?

More Share ✕ Twitter\nTwitter Facebook\nFacebook LinkedIn LinkedIn Whatsapp Whatsapp Email Email Getty\nAs COVID-19 and other respiratory infections rise across the country, some major health systems are bringing back mask requirements to stop the spread of infections.\nThis week, Mass General Brigham, the largest health system in Massachusetts, said it will require masking for health care staff who interact directly with patients in clinical care locations starting Jan. 2.\nPatients and visitors will be “strongly encouraged” to wear a facility-issued mask. Masks will not be required for staff in hallways and common areas.\nThe health system in a statement said its policy is based on the percentage of patients presenting to emergency departments or outpatient clinics with symptoms of respiratory illness.\nOnce this figure exceeded 2.85 percent for two consecutive weeks, the masking requirement took effect. It will end once the level falls below 2.85 percent for a week.\nMost hospitals eased or eliminated their masking requirements last spring, after the federal government ended the COVID-19 public health emergency.\nAnother major Boston hospital, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, began requiring masks for patients and staff on Dec. 18. The hospital said the policy would be in place for the “foreseeable future.”\nThe hospital said there is no single data point leaders use to gauge when the requirement will end.\n“We check a number of different data points, including rates of influenza-like illness, staff absenteeism, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations caused by respiratory viruses. We will lift the mask requirement when these data points remain consistently lower,” the hospital said on its website.\nMeanwhile, in D.C., the region’s largest rehabilitation hospital is requiring masks for all staff and patients who are admitted, but not for visitors or outpatient areas.\nIn a message to staff, Medstar National Rehabilitation Hospital said the move was meant to protect staff because there’s been an increase in positive COVID tests on admission. As a result, there’s been an increase in exposure from patients to staff members.\nAnd in Wisconsin, UW Health recently returned to requiring masks in medical clinics, outpatient care and waiting rooms.\nThe new requirements come as the JN.1 variant has become the most common strain of the virus spreading across the United States.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the variant accounted for 44 percent of COVID-19 infections nationwide by mid-December, up from about 7 percent in late November.\nTags COVID-19 Hospitals Masks",
