    "text": "Willem Dafoe convenció a que todas sus alpacas tienen ‘personalidades’ de estilo humano\nWillem Dafoe cree que cada una de sus alpacas tiene una personalidad humana.\nEl actor de ‘Poor Things’, de 68 años, lleva años siguiendo una dieta prácticamente vegetariana, pero reveló que tiene una granja en su casa a las afueras de Roma repleta de animales porque ama su compañía.\nAsí lo dijo al periódico The Observer que tiene un huerto y muchos animales:\n‘Soy básicamente vegetariano, así que lo hago sólo por el placer de su compañía y para tratar de darles una buena vida, lo cual es un poco ingenuo’.\nDafoe también se refirió a sus animales como ‘otras personas’ que viven en su casa en Italia.\nTambién habló de cómo hace unos meses una foto de él con su coprotagonista de ‘Poor Things’, Mark Ruffalo, de 56 años, se volvió viral de ellos con una de las alpacas de Willem.\nDijo sobre el animal:\n‘Un bebé. Son hermosos’.\nY cuando se le preguntó si creía que sus alpacas tenían personalidad, dijo:\n‘Sí, eso es todo. Cada uno es muy distinto. Con las ovejas y las cabras, algunas las conoces bien, algunas tienen nombres y realmente se quedan, pero algunas son solo ovejas y cabras. Pero con cada alpaca tienes una relación particular y conoces su carácter’.\nWillem pasó horas maquillando para interpretar al Dr. Godwin ‘God’ Baxter en la última película de Yorgos Lanthimos, ‘Poor Things’, que también está protagonizada por Emma Stone, Ramy Yousser, Christopher Abbott y Jerrod Carmichael.\nEn una nueva versión de ‘Frankenstein’, su trama se centra en el personaje de Emma, Bella Baxter, una joven victoriana que, tras ser crudamente recucitada por un científico tras su suicidio, huye con un abogado libertino para embarcarse en una odisea de descubrimiento y liberación sexual.\nHa sido nombrada una de las 10 mejores películas de 2023 por el American Film Institute y la National Board of Review, y ha sido nominada a siete Globos de Oro, incluida Mejor Película: Musical o Comedia, y ganó 13 premios Critics Choice Awards, incluida Mejor Película.",

En esta ocasión estuvo presente una periodista de El País , de Cali, perteneciente a la casa de SEMANA . “Durante uno de los conciertos privados de la Feria de Cali, en donde El Gran Combo era el protagonista del ‘show’, fueron varios los ciudadanos que se unieron para reprochar al presidente . El cántico, que ha resonado en diferentes escenarios del país en las últimas semanas, se escuchó hacia la 1:00 de la madrugada de este martes 26 de diciembre en el Centro de Eventos Valle del Pacífico”, se informó.“Con El Gran Combo en el escenario y en medio de un cambio de canción, algunos de los asistentes a este concierto comenzaron a gritar “fuera Petro”. Mientras unos solo se reían, otros se unieron al unísono de esta frase cada vez más popular. Sin embargo, el coro se disipó a los (pocos) minutos y la fiesta continuó al ritmo de la salsa”, agregó la periodista en el citado medio .

    "title": "New system alerts coastal First Nations about hazardous spills on land and water",
    "text": "A new notification system and app that alerts coastal B.C. First Nations about oil or hazardous chemical spills on their lands and waters was recently launched. The initiative was developed collaboratively between 12 First Nations and the province’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. The process was coordinated by Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative. The system uses technology from Alertable, an emergency alert system that is used by various local governments to notify residents about critical alerts in their communities such as those related to floods or fires. In 2021, when planning for a Reconciliation Framework for Bioregional Oceans Management and Protection was taking place, coastal First Nations recognized a need for improved spill notification systems on their territories, according to a news release from Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative. A total of 22 First Nations have signed up for the alerts. Locally, Nanwakolas Council — a group representing Mamalilikulla, Tlowitsis, Da’naxda’xw Awaetlala, Wei Wai Kum, We Wai Kai and K’ómoks First Nations — also participated in the development of the alert system. Julie Gordon, working on behalf of Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative, told The Discourse in an email that the app has replaced a manual approach to alert First Nations about spills and is paving the way for more timely responses to these spills. Subscribers to the app will now receive spill alerts right away. “[The manual approach] resulted in gaps and delays to First Nations getting timely information about spills. These delays could devastate marine ecosystems and the food stocks and livelihoods of Coastal First Nations communities,” Gordon said. Steve Diggon, marine program manager for Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative, said there have been various spills in the past as well as near-miss incidents that highlighted the importance of such an alert system. He said a few spills have also left a devastating impact on the environment and surrounding communities. In 2016, the U.S.-owned Nathan E. Stewart tugboat ran aground and spilled 110,000 litres of heavy oil and diesel and 2,000 litres of lubricants into the Seaforth Channel on Haíɫzaqv (Heiltsuk) territory. The area was a major source for shellfish harvesting for Heiltsuk Nation, with the clam beds in the area providing up to $200,000 in income each year for the Nation, according to a 2021 CBC News story that outlined how the nation was still heavily impacted by the incident five years later. The response to that spill from both the corporation behind the catastrophe and the provincial and the federal governments was “botched,” according to the Nation. The Canadian Coast Guard didn’t notify Heiltsuk leaders for three hours, and it took another 17 hours for a Transport Canada spill response team to arrive. In a 2017 news release from Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative, Kelly Brown, director of Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Department said ”we’re learning the hard way that Indigenous people and coastal communities can’t count on polluters, Western Canada Marine Response Corporation, or the governments of B.C. and Canada in a crisis situation.” In 2017, a storm left the Jake Shearer tugboat disconnected from its fuel barge off the coast of Bella Bella in an important Heiltsuk food harvesting location. The American fuel barge Zidelle Marine 277 was carrying 468,000 litres of gasoline and about 3.5 million litres of diesel and was marked as a potential risk of spill at the time, according to CBC News. Only one year after the Nathan E. Stewart spill, the incident left the community calling for a need for more Indigenous-led responses to potential spills. Other major spill incidents can be found on the province’s website, and many have occurred along the coastal regions that the new alert system will cover. These include various fuel spills along northern Vancouver Island, a diesel spill north of Haida Gwaii in 2020 and a storage tank diesel spill in Rivers Inlet in 2021. Diggon said the Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative is supporting First Nation communities in preventative work and pre-planning in the event of future incidents. Previously when a spill occurred, the incident report would be sent to a provincial environmental Emergency Coordination Centre where someone would then attempt to reach First Nation communities in the vicinity of the incident using lists of phone numbers. Diggon said a variety of factors could impact whether or not the phone call would get through or not, such as whether the numbers are up to date or if the spill incident happened during business hours. Now, Diggon said First Nations can choose to receive notifications through their smartphones and the app. First Nation members such as chiefs and councillors, as well as people who are working in the field such as “marine stewardship directors, Guardian Watchmen or marine officers can all sign up for specific areas and collectively receive the alert.” Using the app, First Nations are able to self-select their home territories, as well as adjacent areas that may affect them if there is ever a spill incident. By signing up for alerts, they can be notified about a spill incident in the areas they’ve signed up for. One group that will be using this new system is the Coastal Guardian Watchmen who lead an Indigenous stewardship program that works to look after the lands and waters for Coastal First Nations. Danny Hurry, Guardian Watchmen manager for Wei Wai Kum First Nation, told The Discourse that much of the Guardian Watchmen’s role involves restoration work and the protection of the natural resources within the nation’s territory. He said that he has run a lot of preparedness drills with the surrounding nations, such as K’ómoks and Wei Wei Kai. “We all know each other quite well, it’s kind of like a nice tight knit group,” Hurry said. He also said the new alert system is important for Wei Wai Kum. “In previous years, we’ve kind of been left in the dark with a lot of stuff like that. But as things have been moving forward, we’ve been more and more on the frontline aiding in spill response [and] being in the unified command,” Hurry said. “[The alert system has] been a faster process. It relays quite a bit of information, showing you where [the spill] is and gives you constant updates as things go along.” He said that they do get pings outside the nation as well, but when they’re within the territory, the nation can respond accordingly if there’s a big issue. “This really helps us with needs in that situation, and just keeps us on top of things,” he said.",

    "text": "Please consider a gift for Aleteia! Help us spread the joy of Christ's victory. Aleteia depends on your support. Join our Lenten Campaign 2024. DONATE NOW Holy Thursday beautifully demonstrates — in Christ’s washing of the feet and agony in the garden — the communion of God and man. The humble descent of the Son into human nature, however, doesn’t end with the Incarnation. It continues downward to the cross. “Love by its very nature tends to an incarnation,” Fulton Sheen wrote, “and an incarnation by its very nature tends to a crucifixion.” Thus, at the conclusion of St. Paul’s ode to the Incarnation, we hear: “He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death — even death on a cross” (Phil. 2:8). With the possible exception of the fish, the cross is the most ancient symbol of the Christian faith, and today, by far the most universal. No image summarizes the life of Christ and his followers so directly and clearly. And, undoubtedly, it communicates Christ’s victory over sin and death: “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 6:23). The cross is salvation, the “way out” (ex-hodos) of evil. But is it also the “way out” of the world itself? That is to say, is it a symbol of dualistic escapism and pessimism — of fleeing from this world and its problems? No; on the contrary, the cross itself speaks powerfully of the union of the higher and lower worlds — precisely in the union of its vertical and horizontal beams. Union of worlds The Scriptures themselves draw out this connection. They consistently speak of God’s “place” above and man’s “place” below: “The heavens are the Lord’s heavens, but the earth he has given to human beings,” (Ps. 115:16). But they also understand those two metaphysical “places” through the lens of the sky above us and the ground below. When the Bible speaks of heaven, we hear of the stars, moon, and sun; of lightning, thunder, and rainbows; of soaring birds, trees, and mountains. When it speaks of earth, we hear of clay and soil, dust and ashes, grass and flowers, worms and beasts. Just as light and rain falls down from the sky to enliven the soil, so, too, do eternal light and living water fall down to enliven man and the world. These associations aren’t meant to be taken literally, as if God’s “home” is physically atop the sky. Rather, the dome of the sky symbolizes the transcendent mystery of God’s dwelling, whereas the expanse of the earth symbolizes the familiarity of our own — sky and all. The physical vertical and horizontal (the heavens and the earth) orient us to the metaphysical vertical and horizontal. What does all this have to do with [Good Friday](/2022/04/15/why-is-it-called-good-friday-when-jesus-died/) and the cross? An embrace Just as Christ is the communion of both God and man, he is also the communion of both God’s place and man’s place. He is the kingdom of God in person, radiating holiness and perfection from above; yet he also embraces man’s world with all its shadows and sorrows, right down to the horrific suffering and death of the cross. All of this is captured symbolically in the convergence of its two beams, the meeting of the metaphysical vertical and horizontal for the life of the Church, and through the Church, of the world. As G.K. Chesterton wrote: “The cross, though it has at its head a collision and a contradiction, can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape. Because it has a paradox in its center it can grow without changing.” Does this mean that God celebrates all the suffering and sorrow of this fallen world in themselves? No — because such darkness won’t enter his light in the end: “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more” (Rev. 21:4). It does, however, mean that God embraces and transfigures that suffering and sorrow. After the Resurrection, we are given a striking detail: The wounds in his hands and his side from his Crucifixion remain (John 20:20). The Way doesn’t erase the wounds of earth; it radiates heavenly light through them. This communion of heaven and earth will one day reach its culmination in the “new heavens and the new earth,” when — far from escaping this world for a heaven above — the new Jerusalem will descend to this world below (Rev. 21:2). In the meantime, the people of God lift high the cross — a symbol not only of deliverance from sin but of God’s embrace of the world: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life” (John 3:16).",

[AGENCIAS](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=AGENCIAS) Los turistas, que poco a poco regresan, ambientan al puerto. Viajeros procedentes del Valle de México, principalmente, reaniman las actividades que habían estado casi paralizadas desde el pasado 25 de octubre, cuando golpeó el Huracán Otis. Acapulco registró para este fin de semana una disponibilidad de 4 mil 500 cuartos de hotel y una ocupación de 71 por ciento, según datos oficiales. Algunas familias, como el caso de los Vilchez, viajaron en caravana, rentaron casas y departamentos que sufrieron pocos daños y, no obstante los montones de desechos todavía visibles en la playa de la Zona Diamante, disfrutaron del mar. RECUPERACIÓN DISPAREJA Sin embargo, la recuperación no ha sido pareja para todos, Azael Chávez, encargada del restaurante Las Gaviotas en Playa Bonfil, explicó ayer a mediodía que solo tenía ocupadas seis mesas y había perdido una amplia zona de playa por los efectos del huracán. \"Estamos trabajando a un 30 por ciento de nuestra capacidad, de los 12 meseros que yo tengo trabajando en una temporada normal ahora estoy trabajando solamente con cuatro\", informó.",
