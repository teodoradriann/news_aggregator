    "text": "By REYNALD MAGALLON\nTNT may have left Game 2 with a broken wall in its dugout but not their spirits.\nRey Nambatac came to the rescue and nailed a clutch triple in the waning seconds as the Tropang Giga pulled off an 87-85 escape against Barangay Ginebra in Game 3 of the PBA Season 49 Commissioner’s Cup finals series at the PhilSports Arena in Pasig City on Wednesday, March 19.\nTied at 82 in the final minute, the Tropang Giga battled for three offensive rebounds before they found Nambatac wide open on the left corner for the go-ahead triple with 30.1 seconds left.\nRondae Hollis-Jefferson had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists but none bigger than the game-preserving steal off an errant pass from RJ Abarrientos in the final possession.\nAbarrientos and the Kings played without resident import Justin Brownlee for the last one and a half quarter after sustaining a dislocated right thumb at the 6:42 mark of the third.\nBrownlee dove for the loose ball off a fallen Calvin Oftana and seemed to have hurted his finger during his fall.\nHe immediately grimaced in pain as he retreated back to the bench, and later on to the dugout before he was brought to the hospital for further treatment and examination.\nEven without Brownlee though, the Kings remained very much in contention even knotting the contest at 82 apiece heading into the final minute.\nGinebra even had the chance to take the lead but the TNT defense held on and forced Stephen Holt to a reverse layup with the shot clock running out.\nOftana, then botched a wide open layup on the other end but the Tropang Giga crashed the board and still had multiple attempts before finding Nambatac for the go-ahead triple.\nBrownlee still topscored Ginebra with 19 points, four rebounds and six assists before exiting while Scottie Thompson finished with 15 points, eight rebounds, five assists in a losing effort.",

    "text": "Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said that only 10% of his budget promises are remaining to be completed and another 5% would be fulfilled in the next assembly session as various bills will be introduced. He added that 90% of his budgetary promises have either commenced or completed for the financial year 2023-2024. Chief minister told TOI that he will place an action taken report on the budget in the assembly to inform the public about the performance of his government.“I can say that only 10% budgetary promises are left to be started. Of these 5% are related to ease of doing business and some amendments to the existing law will be done in the budget session,” Sawant said, adding that most of the promised projects will take a year or two for completion. Last week, the cabinet granted its approval to summon the budget session from February 2. Sawant said that the assembly’s business advisory committee will decide the number of days for the session.Opening his second innings with the first budget of the newly-elected BJP government, Sawant presented a Rs 24,467.4 crore budget for 2022-23 with a strong focus on job creation and on making Goa self-reliant. The chief minister chose to leave taxes unchanged and promised to increase the state’s dwindling income through reforms. The Economic Survey makes the state government’s economic predictions clear, with deposits in banks outpacing the state’s gross state domestic product. Goa’s GSDP is estimated at Rs 91,416 crore in the coming financial year indicating a 7% growth, but total bank deposits have already outpaced the economy to stand at Rs 93,618 crore.Among the many reforms that Sawant promised to introduce is the implementation of e-governance measures such as e-office and e-HRMS, which will enable the government to go paperless and maintain a centralised database of employees.To promote entrepreneurship and job creation in the state, the budget promised to create women entrepreneurship development programmes at district and state level. He also said that the government would launch a dedicated entrepreneurship policy, while a study will also be conducted to identify the mismatch between demand and supply of trained workforce.",

    "title": "Biomarker predicts response to immunotherapy in liver cancer",
    "text": "It will soon be possible to determine which patients with a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from immunotherapy, according to a study by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine .\nPosted in ‘ Molecular Cell ‘, the research provides new insights into two proteins, p62 and NBR1, and their opposing roles in regulating the response of a critical immune response in the liver’s fight against tumors, interferon.\nData show that high levels of NBR1, an immune system inhibitor, in these specialized cells can identify patients who are unlikely to respond to immunotherapies. On the other hand, NBR1 reduction strategies have been seen to help reduce tumor size in animal models, suggesting a possible new therapeutic approach for the subset of patients who do not respond to treatment. immunotherapy .\n“p62 and NBR1 are yin and yang,” said the study’s co-principal investigator, Jorge Moscat . « Unlike NBR1, if p62 is high in hepatic stellate cells, the patient is protected against cancer, but if it is low, the immune system is affected. “If NBR1 is high, the immune system is affected, but if NBR1 is low, the immune response is increased.”\nUntil recently, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had few treatment options and those that were available extended life by only a few months. Immunotherapy has offered a new alternative and can prolong your life by up to two years.\nThe liver is an organ that is tremendously immunosuppressed, explains María Díaz-Meco, co-principal investigator. « Reactivating the immune system is a very attractive approach that is now bearing fruit ».\nHowever, not all patients respond to immunotherapy and only a small percentage achieve long-term remission. Doctors cannot currently predict which patients will benefit. “We need biomarkers to identify which patients will respond and who will achieve long-term survival,” he says.\nPrevious research showed that the p62 protein, key in the immune response against hepatocellular carcinoma, is reduced in patients with this disease. The new study reveals that p62 activates STING to promote antitumor immunity, while NBR1 blocks this response by degrading STING.\nDeleting NBR1 in mice restored the immune response and shrank tumors. The team seeks to develop therapies that degrade NBR1 and activate STING to improve immunotherapy and study whether eliminating NBR1 prevents metastasis and resistance to treatments.\n#Biomarker #predicts #response #immunotherapy #liver #cancer",

    "title": "Are Your Kids Phone-Obsessed? Here’s How to Reduce Screen Time",
    "text": "©ISTOCKPHOTO.COM / SCOFFEEANDMILK Highly addictive time-sucks.\nThat’s what the social media apps populating our smartphones were designed to be from the outset, Napster co-creator and former Facebook president Sean Parker said in a 2017 interview with Axios news outlet. The clicks, the likes, the constant scrolling. “It literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,” Parker told the interviewer. “It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.”\nGuess what? We know.\n“Ever hear of TikTok brain?” says Noreen Iqbal, LCSW, the owner and director of the Olive Branch Therapy Group, with locations in East Brunswick and Somerville. Our attention spans have decreased due to the effects these apps have on our brains and behaviors.\n“We have overprotected our children in the real world and under-protected them online,” Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at the NYU Stern School of Business, told CBS News while promoting his latest book, The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. His research findings are alarming.\nIn the past decade, as smartphone use has become more widespread, anxiety, depression, suicide, eating disorders, and other mental health-related issues have all increased exponentially among kids and teenagers, according to some of the statistics cited in Haidt’s book.\nAside from the health-related impact that smartphones have had on our children, there’s the effects these pocket-sized windows to the online world have had on education. Teachers complain that the distracting presence of smartphones in the classroom makes it harder to teach and more difficult for students to learn.\nOn June 18, the Los Angeles Unified School District became the largest school district in the country to ban cell phones from its classrooms. Some New Jersey schools, like those in the Red Bank Regional High School District, have enacted similar bans. Officials at Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls pre-K to grade 12 private school in Princeton, are about to begin their second year as a phone-free environment.\nSo now that the genie is out of the bottle and we know what smartphones are potentially doing to our kids’ brains and social development, the question is, “What should parents do about it?”\n©ISTOCKPHOTO.COM / LACHEEV BEGIN WITH REAL CONNECTIONS\nIqbal says it’s up to parents, not a classroom full of fifth graders, to decide when and if your child is ready for a smartphone. “Know the kid you’re raising, not the kid you want to raise,” she says. Often that means being connected to your child and having open, honest and ongoing conversations about cell phone use and what will be expected of your children. She suggests talking to them about the permanence of a digital footprint, bullying and being bullied, forwarding photos received from someone else, and general cell phone etiquette. She suggests telling them, “If you wouldn’t say that to someone in person, or you wouldn’t be comfortable having your parents see it, then don’t post it and don’t send it.”\nCONTRACTS AREN’T JUST FOR CELL PHONE CARRIERS\nOnce parents have talked with their kids about expectations and limits regarding cell phone use, Iqbal suggests putting it in writing. Before signing a contract with a cell phone carrier, sign one with your child. “There are many examples online,” Iqbal says. A quick Google search will produce a variety of samples and templates that address such topics as when and where cell phones can be used, with whom children are allowed to communicate, when it’s time to put away or turn off cell phones, and where phones can be charged.\nDON’T BLAME IT ALL ON SMARTPHONES\n“If we want to get kids out of the virtual world, we have to give them back the real one,” says Lenore Skenazy, president of Let Grow and founder of the Free-Range Kids Movement. “The real world is pretty engaging … three more senses are involved.” Preceding the introduction of the smartphone was a fear-driven, hands-on style of parenting that made it more difficult for children to do things without constant adult supervision, like playing at the park or running errands, she says.\nIqbal agrees that overparenting coupled with smartphone use has contributed to social anxiety in children and teens because they lack the necessary skills to build in-person relationships.\nSkenazy says kids become less anxious when they learn to problem-solve and make decisions in the real world without the help of a parent or adult. Let Grow, the nonprofit fostering childhood independence, offers two free programs for schools. The Let Grow Experience promotes “homework” in the form of having students do something on their own, with their parent or guardian’s permission, but without any help. It can be something as simple as baking and delivering cookies to a neighbor down the street, taking a city bus alone, or walking to a dance lesson or karate class by themselves. The Let Grow Play & Social Club, meanwhile, encourages schools to stay open before or after school to provide a place for kids to gather and play without cell phones and without adults organizing their interactions. The Let Grow website offers free information for parents to incorporate these same ideas at home without school involvement.\nDUMB PHONES MAY BE THE SMARTER CHOICE\nFlip phones and cell phones like Light Phone, which have limited features and no internet access, might be a better choice for younger children. “It teaches them to step up,” Iqbal says. Children can still communicate with parents and friends but won’t have access to downloadable content and apps that they may not be old enough to view. If parents do decide to purchase smartphones for their kids, Iqbal says they might consider software like BARK that can limit screen time, block inappropriate content, report searches in real-time, and monitor text messages. Parents should be continually educating themselves about all the available tools out there, she says.\nSEEK OUT LIKE-MINDED PARENTS AND EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS\nBut what about complaints that your child will feel isolated or different if they don’t have the most up-to-date smartphone by the time they’re 12? Iqbal says parents can join initiatives like Wait Until 8th (waituntil8th.org), an organization aimed at delaying smartphone use until after the end of the 8th grade. They can also find like-minded parents either in their towns or online with similar ideas about cell phone usage for their children. “If you don’t think your kid can handle it. Just wait,” she says.\nAnother option might be to seek out schools with a phonefree culture, like Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart. Marissa Muoio, Ed.D., Head of the Upper School, and Julia Wall, Head of School, say that as educators, they had been tracking and responding to the ongoing global mental health crisis, which has had a particular impact on teen girls. In the summer of 2023, they made the decision to have their Upper School (grades 9-12) join their Middle School (grades 5-8) as a phone-free environment and have students in those grades keep their cell phones in their lockers during the school day. The impact has been both profound and positive.\nWhen walking through the school’s lounge spaces and lunchroom, Muoio and Wall notice both are louder and more joyful. “Kids are actually conversing, not just swapping TikTok videos. They asked for board games and cards as tools for connection, and more students are now choosing to go outside during their free time,” Muoio says. “We deliberately did not use the word ‘ban’ when referring to our decision,” Wall adds. “Instead, we spent ample time with the word ‘freedom’ as a way to explain our goals to students and parents. Being a phone-free school means our students have the time and space for collaboration, creativity and sustained thinking.”\nMODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR\nAdults can be just as addicted to social media and their phones as their children. “If you’re constantly posting and always on your phone and not living outside of the phone world, then children see that,” Iqbal says. If parents normalize living a life without social media, then their children will do the same.\nLack of sleep is another cause of anxiety in children and teens—and you—and because of that Iqbal suggests using charging stations placed outside of everyone’s bedrooms.\nCONSIDER THERAPY\nAs cell phone and social media use increase, so too have things like anxiety and depression. Don’t wait until you need a therapist for your child to find a therapist for your child. Having another trusted adult to talk to can help children and teens navigate the highs and lows of childhood and adolescence and give them someone familiar to turn to when they are in crisis or need to work through a problem. When you introduce your children to therapy at a young age, it makes them more comfortable reaching out to a support system outside of their home, Iqbal says.\n—Jennifer Salvato Doktorski received a 2024 Fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts.

    "text": "Top 2025 NHL Draft Prospect Leads USA to Victory\nThe United States dominated their opening contest at the 2025 World Junior Championship thanks to one of the top [2025 NHL Draft ](https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/news-feed-page/top-2025-nhl-draft-prospects)prospects. The USA team took on Germany in their first Group A action of the tournament and blew the Germans out of the water. Thanks to a dazzling WJC debut for center James Hagens, the Americans won their first game by a score of 10-4.\n17-year-old [James Hagens](https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/prospects-feed/posts/james-hagens-tops-2025-nhl-draft-rankings) looked like a seasoned veteran for the United States in his first game of the tournament. USA Head Coach David Carle made a savvy decision to play Hagens with his two Boston College teammates, Gabe Perreault and Ryan Leonard, and the line was dominant nearly every shift. Hagens stole the show for the trio and the US, posting two goals and two assists for four points.\nThe New York native kicked off the scoring for the United States. After defenseman Cole Hutson's shot attempt in tight was turned aside by the German net minder, Hagens was able to find the puck in the mess of bodies and put it just barely over the goal line.\nHagens would then set up Team USA's second goal by feeding winger Gabe Perreault for his first of two goals in the game. It took less than one period of action for the 2025-draft eligible forward to make himself noticeable.\nHe also got his team back on track after the German team seemed to turn the momentum. With USA's lead cut down to just one goal, Hagens decided to just do it himself and buried an absolute rocket of a shot to give his team a two goal lead again. From there, they kept piling it on and Germany struggled to keep things competitive.\nAll in all, [Hagens](https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/news-feed-page/top-2025-nhl-draft-prospects-lead-canadas-wjc-roster) finished with four points and had an impressive and persuasive debut. For all NHL organizations keeping close tabs on these games, it's performances like these that shoot you up the rankings and convince teams to take you at the top of the draft. Hagens has made his presence known already and the United States team is off and running at the 2025 World Junior Championship.\n[Make sure you bookmark Breakaway On SI for the latest news, exclusive interviews, recruiting coverage, and more!](https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/)",
