    "text": "The first quarter of 2024 has seen the generation of coal-fired power and emissions scale new, alarming highs in India amidst a sweeping heatwave and a decline in hydropower generation\nFar from tapering, India's consumption of fossil fuel-fired energy and resulting emissions hit an all-time high in the first quarter of 2024, driven by a heatwave and reduced hydropower generation. Coal-fired power, which is still 70 percent of India's energy output, shot up by\nIndia, which still relies on coal for over 70 percent of its electricity output, saw its coal-fired power generation jump by 9.6 percent year-over-year to 338 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first quarter of 2024. Alongside, total power sector emissions spiralled by 316 MMT of CO2 and other toxic gases.\nThe year started with a surge in coal-fired units amid a prolonged heatwave and above-normal temperatures, which significantly increased electricity consumption. This was further fueled by the continued rise in power demand, a clear indicator of the country's expanding economic growth. The demand for thermal power heightened further because of the fall in hydropower output by 11 percent in March.\nGrid Controller of India data indicates that the share of coal in India's power generation increased to 77 percent during the first week of April, marking a rise of roughly 2 percentage points when compared to the same period in 2023.",

    "text": "Re: the Dec. 24 article \"Rumors, headlines factor in border rush.\" Thanks to Emily Bregel, for this article. Her report Christmas Eve? Politicians’ untruthful rhetoric and then news disseminating their misinformation don’t escape news-savvy people in the Americas. Statements we’ve heard, like “open borders” offer smugglers huge paydays from people dreaming of such opportunities, affirmed by American leaders’ quotes. Wouldn’t you act if you were desperate? Add rumors smugglers create, implicitly supported in December by Congress not moving on support for “CBP One Application” or personnel. Smugglers say the Program is closing. “Don’t apply and wait, just come.” Frustrated? Write Republican Rep. Ciscomani. Ask him what he’s been saying! Our Senators are working for solutions. Yet Republicans want immigration “broken.” Fundraising for 2024; “It’s all Biden’s fault.” Yet the Biden Administration’s Homeland Security Application Process initially slowed the migration process! Trump’s $15 billion wall? Impotent! Buy a $100 reciprocating saw. Wall breaching has occurred thousands of times, costing millions more for repairs. Republicans: Tell the truth! Cooperate!

    "text": "No green thumb? Tips for aspiring gardeners this Spring\nJACKSON, Tenn. — Spring is officially here and many people may want to get out to the garden.\nNot everyone has the resources for a giant garden or greenhouse in their backyard. Some people live in apartments, or have very small yards. That should not stop you from gardening, as there are other ways you can get involved.\n“You can garden in your flowerbed, you can garden in buckets, you can build a raised bed, some people even garden in bails of wheat straw,” said Ginger Kemp, owner of\nR & J Feed Supply. “It’s just open ended possibilities that you can garden without having a large garden that you have to till up and things like that.”\nIf you have never done any gardening before, Kemp gives us some great tips and advice to make sure we start off right.\n“You want a plant that has a really sturdy, like a stalk on it,” Kemp said. “So it is really easy for you to plant without having to break it off and things like that. When you put it in your soil, you want to plant it deep so you’ll have a good root system established.”\nThis can help make sure it does not get damaged by the wind. Kemp says it is also important to have good quality soil so your plants can flourish.\nKemp also says that if you have thought about gardening, you should simply give it a shot.\n“The big thing is don’t be scared to try. If you don’t try, then you don’t succeed or fail. That is one of my personal things. When I go home at night I love to work in the yard or work in the garden,” said Kemp.\nShe also says that it is a great tool for children, learning how to take care of a plant and watching it grow.\nIf you want to learn more, you can contact your local Ag center to ask any questions that you may have.\nFor more local news,\nclick here.",

    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) -Rescuers pulled three more crew members and a security guard alive from the Red Sea on Thursday, maritime security sources said, a day after Houthi militants sank the Greek ship Eternity C and said they were holding some of the crew still missing.\nThis brings the total number of those rescued so far to 10, including eight Filipino crew members, one Indian and one Greek security guard. The people found on Thursday had spent more than 48 hours in the water. Another 11 people are still missing.\n\"This fills us with more courage to continue to search for those missing, as the Greek vessel operator requested, and shows that our search plan was correct,\" said Nikos Georgopoulos, an official at the Greece-based maritime risk firm Diaplous.\nEternity C is the second Greek bulk carrier sunk this week by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia in Yemen. The attacks, which Houthis say are an act of solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war, have ended months of calm in the area.\nThe United States' Mission in Yemen has accused the Houthis of kidnapping crew members and has called for their immediate release.\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis' military spokesperson said in a televised address that the Yemeni navy had \"responded to rescue a number of the ship's crew, provide them with medical care, and transport them to a safe location\".\nThe Eternity C sank on Wednesday days after Houthis hit and sunk the Magic Seas, reviving a campaign launched in November 2023 that has seen more than 100 ships attacked.\nBoth of the vessels hit this week flew Liberian flags and were operated by Greek companies. All crew from the Magic Seas were rescued before it went down.\nEternity C was first hit on Monday with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speed boats. Four people are presumed dead, with maritime security sources saying they were killed in the attacks. If confirmed, the deaths would be the first fatalities in the area since June 2024.\nFollowing a second attack on Tuesday morning, the crew were forced to jump into the water. Rescuers have been searching for them since Wednesday morning.\nThe vessel's operator, Cosmoship Management, has not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.\n(Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Yannis Souliotis in Athens and Jonathan Saul in LondonEditing by Gareth Jones)\nBy Renee Maltezou\nShare © Reuters - 2025",
