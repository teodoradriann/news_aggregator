    "text": "New Delhi: Indians everywhere had good reason to rejoice on December 28, when the Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, revealed that the death sentence to eight former Indian Navy personnel in Qatar had been commuted. According to the MEA, the Court of Appeal of Qatar had reduced the sentences in the Dahra Global case. The eight Indian Navy veterans: Commander Purenendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Commander Amit Nagpal, Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma and Sailor Ragesh had been working for over five years with Dahra Global Technologies, a defence services provider company based in Qatar. In August 2022, they were detained by the Qatar State Security Bureau, Qatar’s intelligence agency. Although the charges against the eight were never revealed, it was reported that they had been detained on allegations of espionage. It took almost two months for the eight individuals to get consular access and then after just seven hearings, they were sentenced to death on October 26, 2023. It goes without saying that the story caught national attention when news about the death sentence broke in India. Former colleagues of the eight former Navy officials and Indians across the globe were shocked to hear about the nature of the charges and the harshness of the sentence. “It was really unfathomable for the colleagues in the Indian Navy to even imagine that the highly decorated, extremely professional officers who were handpicked and chosen few to train the Qatari Navy would ever indulge in any act that would tarnish their own and India’s image,” says Commander (Retd.) Rajiv Sardana, a former colleague of some of the officers who are presently detained in Qatar. Former Lt. Commander, Indian Navy and Advocate Bharat Singh too was elated to hear the news. “I can sense that there is a sense of joy and relief among veterans and citizens that death sentence has been commuted and the personnel are being brought back to India for the remainder of their sentence, where they would be close to their family, friends and have legal assistance available to them. I believe that continuous diplomatic efforts made by the government of India, meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Qatar Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the sidelines of COP28, and the good diplomatic relations between Doha and New Delhi have led to a successful outcome,” Singh says. A note of caution Commander Sardana too had a similar reaction but he did have a word of warning, “This is not a vindication or success yet,” he stated, adding “the past 40 days have helped commute the death sentence. The Indian government has been extremely supportive and the embassy in Qatar has played a vital role in the appeal process. While each of the naval officers have received varied sentences, the appeal process will be filed jointly just as before. The charges continue to remain confidential since it’s a highly sensitive matter between the two countries.” To be sure, the former Navy officers are not yet free to go home to their families. Indeed, a lengthy process of appeal remains before they can return to their homeland. According to Singh, there is a way forward. “The battle for securing the release of eight Navy personnel is far from over, and has only just begun. Though it is a relief that death sentence has been commuted by the Court of First instance in Qatar has held them guilty. Various aspects of the present case must be brought out to understand the gravity of the case. Most of these eight personnel are ex-servicemen from Indian Navy and holding President’s commission. By the nature of their status and past appointments in the interest of national security, the government of India should have pleaded sovereign immunity, and simply not allowed them to be arrested in foreign nation and be subjected to torture or unethical treatment,” he says. Setting a precedent? Lt. Commander Singh also pointed to a precedent that may hold a key to the proper resolution of the case of the Qatar 8. “I would like to highlight the famous case before Kerela High Court of Masiimilano Latorre & Ors Vs Union of India & ors, WP(C). No. 4542 of 2012, order dated 20 Feb 2012. On February 15, 2012, an Indian fishing vessel ‘The St. Antony’ engaged in fishing 20.5 nautical miles off the coast of Kerala came under small arm firing from two Italian men on board Italian Oil Tanker ship – Enrica Lexie enroute from Sri-lanka to Egypt,” he says. “The Italian contingent of Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) wrongly confused fishermen to be pirates and fired at them killing two fishermen. The Indian Navy and the Coast guard were pressed into action and it was found that sergeant Massimiliano Latorre and Sergeant Salvatore Girone, both involved in firing were members of VPD, who were serving under contract and were members of Italian Armed Forces. They both were arrested, charged with various provisions of Indian Penal Code, 1860, including charges of murder and attempt to murder,” Singh adds. “The case was plead by the Republic of Italy on behalf of detainees, with legal assistance provided to the accused. Italy plead provisions of United Nation Conventions of the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) and sovereign immunity, it was their primary argument that accused were the members of Italy’s armed forces and Indian courts have no jurisdiction to try their case. The issue subsequently came before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Hague, Netherlands, which in its arbitrary award, directed Italy to pay compensation for loss of life of the two fishermen and gave immunity to Italian Marines for their acts, declaring that Indian courts to cease proceedings and further declared that they have no jurisdiction,” he elaborates. As noted above, this is but the first step to the resolution of a controversy that has threatened to upend the close relations between India and Qatar. It should be noted that the government of India and the Indian Navy have been deeply invested in the case. The Indian Ambassador to Qatar and important Indian officials were present in the court when the death sentence was commuted. Now, thanks to their advocacy, the eight officers will likely be able to hear from their families in the three calls they are allowed to make each week. As Commander Sardana notes, “It is a long legal battle ahead but with the support of the Indian Navy and the MEA the families are hopeful that the officers will be back in India soon.” Read [Latest News](https://www.news9live.com/latest-news) and [Breaking News](https://www.news9live.com/) at News9 Live, Browse for more [India News](https://www.news9live.com/india)",

    "text": "Reflective, high-visibility clothing may stand out to human drivers at night, but a recent study suggests it may be invisible to a vehicle's automated crash prevention technology.\nThe study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in the US, set out to determine the effectiveness of autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems detecting pedestrians wearing reflective clothing at night.\nWhile IIHS research in the past has shown AEB systems reduce the rate of pedestrian-related incidents of all severities by 27 per cent, the safety system's night-time limitations are described as \"a serious problem\", as most fatal pedestrian crashes occur at night.\nAccording to the IIHS, automakers are working to address such issues, though the non-profit organisation aimed to further investigate \"the effects of conspicuous clothing and increased roadway lighting\" on the performance of pedestrian AEB systems with its latest research.\n100s of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. [Browse now](https://www.carexpert.com.au/new-car-deals/).\nAs part of the study, the IIHS gathered three 2023 cars – a [Honda CR-V](https://www.carexpert.com.au/honda/cr-v), [Mazda CX-5](https://www.carexpert.com.au/mazda/cx-5), and [Subaru Forester](https://www.carexpert.com.au/subaru/forester) – which are all fitted with pedestrian AEB systems.\nMultiple trials were subsequently conducted with an adult-sized dummy dressed in all black; all white; black pants with a fully reflective jacket; and all black with reflective strips – the latter of which intended to mimic outfits worn by road construction workers but without the typical bright yellow or orange.\nThe dummy would then traverse a pedestrian crossing in three different roadway lighting scenarios. One featured no roadway lighting at all, another at 10 lux (twilight), and the final at 20 lux (the legal requirement for crossings in the US).\nAll three vehicles approached the crossing at 25mp/h (40.2km/h).\nWhen the dummy was dressed in black, both the CR-V and CX-5 slowed substantially when using their high-beams with no road illumination. In the same lighting conditions but using low-beam lights, the CR-V failed to slow at all, and the CX-5 reduced its speed by less than one-third. Both vehicles performed better with 20 lux of additional light.\nThe Honda could not detect the dummy when it was dressed in white with no road illumination, but improved in the 10 and 20 lux scenarios. Both cars began to struggle significantly when reflective clothing was introduced.\n\"When the dummy was dressed in the reflective jacket, the CR-V didn't slow in any of the trials, regardless of additional roadway lighting,\" the IIHS wrote in its release\n\"In contrast, with no roadway illumination and with 10 lux of added light, the CX-5 slowed much more than it did when the dummy was clad in black. But with 20 lux of added light, it performed worse with the dummy in the reflective jacket than when it was wearing the black outfit.\"\nWhen the dummy was adorned with reflective strips, both the Honda and Mazda failed to slow in all lighting scenarios.\n\"The placement and motion of reflective strips on the joints and limbs of pants and jackets allows drivers to quickly recognise the pattern of movement as a person,\" IIHS senior research scientist and study author David Kidd said.\n\"Unfortunately, the moving strips didn't have the same effect for the pedestrian AEB systems we tested and probably confounded their sensors.\"\nThe IIHS says \"it's not clear\" why the CR-V and CX-5 struggled with the dummy's reflective strips or how many other manufacturers' systems also face the same limitiations.\nAs for the Forester, which was fitted with Subaru's established EyeSight safety technology, it came to a complete stop in every trial except one, in which the dummy was wearing reflective strips and the roadway was illuminated to 10 lux.\nEven in that test, the IIHS reports it slowed by \"more than 80 per cent\".\nThe IIHS suggests further research is required to fully understand how crash avoidance systems respond to the clothing worn by road construction crews and emergency workers, while organisation president David Harkey described the shortcomings as a \"worrisome blind spot\".\n\"These results suggest that some automakers need to tweak their pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems,\" Mr Harkey said.\n\"It's untenable that the clothes that pedestrians, cyclists and roadway workers wear to be safe may make them harder for crash avoidance technology to recognise.\"\nIt's not the first time issues with pedestrian AEB technology have been reported.\nGeneral Motors (GM) was in hot water for an incident in which [one of its Cruiser autonomous robo-taxis hit a pedestrian](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/gms-driverless-car-division-admits-failings-after-pedestrian-collision), after which the company admitted to many critical failings.\nContent originally sourced from: [CarExpert.com.au](https://www.carexpert.com.au)",

    "text": "At least six tornadoes hit Tennessee this week, destroying homes, flooding roads and killing two people , and the National Weather Service expects to identify more as damage assessments continue Friday. \"We know that there are other tornadoes from yesterday,\" the weather service said in a social media post Thursday, announcing plans for crews to continue surveys Friday. Preliminary reports from three confirmed Wednesday tornadoes were released late Thursday. Information from a fourth touchdown, in Giles County, was released Friday . Here are the details: Columbia tornado path: What path did the tornado in Columbia, Tennessee take? Weather service crews out looking at damage path Columbia, TN tornado In Columbia, an EF-3 with 140 mph winds that was half a mile wide traveled 11 miles, the weather service said. The tornado touched down at about 5:37 p.m. east of the city near Loftin Road and continued for about 30 minutes before it lifted near Flat Creek in Spring Hill. \"Multiple homes received damage along Cothran Rd and Cranford Hollow Rd before the tornado moved north of Highway 412,\" the weather service wrote in a public statement on the tornadoes. \"More intense damage began to occur on Old Highway 99 and Blackburn Lane where large sections of roofs were removed and hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted.\" It was on Blackburn Lane where the tornado reached maximum strength. Cheryl Lovett was killed when her mobile home was swept away. Penny Lovett, who was in the home with Cheryl, was critically injured and flown to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for care. Three other people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Maury Regional Medical Center said. Rutherford County, TN tornado About an hour after the Columbia tornado, an EF-0 with winds of 80 mph touched down in Eagleville and traveled just under 3 miles to Bell Buckle. \"The tornado moved east along New Zion Rd snapping large branches off from hardwood trees,\" the weather service wrote in the statement. \"Trees were uprooted near the intersection of Midland Rd and Jones Rd. The tornado continued east along Jones Rd snapping large limbs and uprooting a few trees before the tornado transitioned to straight line winds near the Gray Fox neighborhood.\" Storm related injuries: Rutherford Schools director shares new details about injured son, 'damage is substantial' Robertson County tornado The weather service identified a third tornado, an EF-1 at speeds of 90 mph, in Robertson County near Springfield. No specific details about that storm have been released as of Friday morning. On Wednesday, social media posts showed the tornado over homes, though no tornado-specific damage reports were released during the day. There were some reports in Robertson County, and photos, that showed downed trees that had landed on homes. Giles County, TN tornado On Friday, the weather service posted that it had identified a fourth tornado from Wednesday's outbreak, in Prospect, Tennessee out of Giles County. The EF-2 had winds of 115 mph and was 600 yards wide. It traveled about 5.7 miles and stopped just west of Interstate 65, the service said. One person was critically injured as a result of the tornado. No fatalities were reported, and no other details were released as of press time for this story. Earlier on Wednesday, in East Tennessee, a 22-year-old man was killed in Claiborne County when a tree fell on his car, emergency officials there told USA TODAY. On Monday, two tornadoes hit the Volunteer State, the weather service confirmed. Survey crews identified an EF-0 in Wilson County about eight miles northeast of Lebanon along Big Spring Road, just north of Old Rome Pike. The only known damage was to trees, meteorologists said. Winds reached about 70 mph and it traveled about half a mile. An EF-1 tornado also touched down Monday afternoon in DeKalb County and traveled about 3.3 miles at 100 mph, the weather service said. No injuries were reported in either of the Monday storms.",

[Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shows-special-pattern-indicating-potential-uptrend-controversial-xrp-outlook-shared-by) may be in a difficult market position because its recent rally seems to have stalled. Since SHIB's price fell more than 20% after hitting new highs, it may find it difficult to sustain its upward trajectory. Due to this recent drop, [SHIB](https://www.tradingview.com/) is now in a phase of consolidation, raising questions about where it will go from here. Shiba Inu's chart displays a candlestick pattern that looks like a spinning bottom from a technical perspective, which is usually an indication of market hesitancy. In addition to suggesting a lack of strong bullish sentiment at this point, this pattern frequently indicates a reversal or pause in the current trend. The spinning bottom pattern, which frequently suggests that the prior upward momentum may not be sustainable, emphasizes how buyers and sellers are achieving a temporary equilibrium. The moving averages emphasize this hazy outlook even more. The market may need to reconsider [SHIB's](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-burn-rate-slumps-but-theres-a-catch) chances for another rally, as the stock is currently trading closer to its support zones despite recent gains.

This would make it more difficult for SHIB to regain bullish momentum in the near future and run the risk of reversing a large portion of recent gains. In the hopes that consolidation around current levels could serve as a foundation for future gains, [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-shows-perfect-elliott-wave-pattern-heres-what-it-means) holders are currently keeping an eye out for indications of stabilization. Overall sentiment is still cautious, though, as the meme coin is under additional pressure due to recent losses and the absence of a clear recovery path. The key level to keep an eye on right now is $0.00002350, as a break above it could reignite bullish sentiment. A decline below $0.00002100, on the other hand, might indicate additional downside risk.",
