    "title": "Trader Joe's New Cookie Tiles Have Customers Hooked",
    "text": "If you are a Trader Joe's mega-fan or even an occasional shopper, it's impossible not to perk up when you see a new food hit the shelves. Recently, Trader Joe's shoppers have noticed a pleasingly pink box greeting them as they enter the affordable grocery chain known for its addicting snacks and multicultural frozen food offerings . The box, which boasts \"Dark Chocolate & Almond Cookie Tiles,\" is $3.99 for 5 ounces of crispy, crunchy, and sweet goodness. Trader Joe's is no stranger to the cookie game , but these are the first tile-shaped cookies in its repertoire.\nAdvertisement Of course, TJ's is (literally) breaking the cookie mold by offering these sweet-n-salty misshapen little squares, but it seems to be working. Early reviews on Reddit are unanimously positive, with some Redditors pointing out that these Dark Chocolate & Almond Cookie Tiles are reminiscent of a seasonal Trader Joe's offering, the Belgian Cookie Trio — specifically, the Milk Chocolate & Almond Cookie of the bunch. Others compared the flavor and consistency to brownie brittle and brownie cookies.\nHow TJ'S Dark Chocolate & Almond Cookie Tiles are made\n@traderjoesgeek/Instagram\nAccording to the Trader Joe's website , these tiles are made at the grocery store's supplier in Thailand. It states that the supplier takes \"a large, thin sheet of golden cookie batter and swirls in bits of dark chocolate and slivered almonds, then 'seals' in these inclusions with another thin layer of batter. The 'sheets' are baked until they reach a craveably crunchy, almost caramelized texture, then cut into bite-sized, snappy squares, or Tiles.\" Obviously, there's no wrong way to eat these cookies, but they would likely pair perfectly with a cup of coffee or tea and would be easily crumbled on top of ice cream or yogurt for some added sweet-treat texture.\nAdvertisement The Trader Joe's product page also lists these tiles as being around for a limited time, so if the above description — paired with the ever-growing online TJ's Cookie Tile fan club — has piqued your interest, we recommend that you add them to your shopping list ASAP. Our guess is that Trader Joe's has ordered a limited quantity of Cookie Tiles to test out the popularity and sales of these new snacks. Hopefully, the hype continues and they'll be added to a more consistent rotation — we are big fans of super crunchy cookies (here's the secret to baking them yourself if you're interested).",

    "text": "El Día\nLa Laguna 04 OCT 2024 6:01 Nuevos vehículos eléctricos para servicios del Ayuntamiento de La Laguna. La Concejalía de Servicios Municipales ha incorporado ocho nuevos vehículos eléctricos. El edil del Área, Fran Hernández, explicó a través de una nota de prensa que «esta adquisición forma parte de una estrategia más amplia para reducir la huella medioambiental en La Laguna, para promover la sostenibilidad y reducir tanto las emisiones contaminantes, como el ruido en las zonas urbanas».\nHernández se refirió a las ventajas que ofrecen estos vehículos en términos de funcionalidad y operatividad, «facilitando especialmente las tareas en áreas de acceso limitado, como el caso histórico de La Laguna, permitiendo realizar operaciones como la rotación de depósitos de quita y pon de forma más ágil y segura, sin causar molestias a los residentes, ni dañar el entorno». «Esta medida está alineada con nuestra estrategia de minimizar la intervención de grandes vehículos en estas zonas», agregó.\nLas unidades, con una capacidad de carga de hasta 3.500 kilos y un diseño de caja abierta , permiten también el traslado de enseres, recogida de electrodomésticos, aparatos eléctricos y electrónicos (RAEE), la carga y descarga de contenedores, baños químicos portátiles, así como el transporte de cargas pesadas y voluminosas. «Una forma de trabajo más eficiente y sencilla, reduciendo tiempos de maniobra y operando de manera respetuosa con el medio ambiente», dijo.\n«Esta incorporación es solo una de las muchas medidas que se están tomando desde la Concejalía», afirmó el Ayuntamiento lagunero en la nota de prensa enviada. «Esta semana también ha empezado a operar una nueva unidad especializada en la limpieza y desinfección de aseos públicos portátiles destinada a reforzar los dispositivos especiales de limpieza que se activan en festividades y eventos», añadió.\nFran Hernández indicó en la nota de prensa que «nuestra prioridad es asegurar que los usuarios puedan acceder a estos aseos públicos en las mejores condiciones posibles, especialmente cuando hablamos de eventos que atraen a grandes multitudes, donde la correcta gestión y mantenimiento de este servicio puede marcar la diferencia en términos de salubridad y comodidad». Y añadió: «Un recurso básico que, aunque a menudo pase desapercibido, es esencial para que la logística y el desarrollo de las celebraciones sea exitosa, generando entornos funcionales y bien gestionados».\nTEMAS",

    "title": "Vatican to make Carlo Acutis first millennial Catholic saint - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "The Vatican announced last week that an Italian teenager is set to become the first millennial saint after Pope Francis attributed him a second miracle.\nCarlo Acutis died from leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15. Nicknamed “God's Influencer” for his commitment to spreading Catholic teachings online, Acutis would be the first person from the millennial generation to become a saint.\nAcutis achieved the first step to sainthood — known as beatification — in 2020 after The Pope attributed Acutis’ first miracle to him, which involved healing a Brazilian child suffering from a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.\nLast week, Pope Francis attributed a second miracle to Acutis. In that miracle, Acutis is credited with healing a university student from Costa Rica who had a brain bleed after undergoing head trauma from falling off her bicycle.\nThe attribution of a second miracle clears the path to sainthood for Acutis. The Vatican has not yet announced a date for Acutis’ canonization, which would formally elevate him to saint status, according to the Catholic News Agency. People visit the tomb of Carlo Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006 aged 15, in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Assisi, Italy, May 26, 2024. Pope Francis has cleared the way for Acutis to be the first saint of the millennial generation. (credit: REUTERS/Matteo Berlenga) 'It was no surprise'\n\"I was happy, but I expected it because I knew Carlo was sainted. For me, it was not a surprise,” Acutis’ mother told Sky News in response to the news of his sainthood.\nMiracles usually undergo a thorough investigation and evaluation process that spans several months. After having two confirmed miracles, an individual becomes eligible for sainthood. Miracles typically achieve something beyond what is naturally possible, such as healing someone with a terminal illness, Catholic World Mission explained.\nBorn in London in 1991, Acutis was passionate about Catholicism from a young age. He used technology to spread the teachings of the Catholic Church and designed and managed websites for his parish and school.\nLater, Acutis created a website documenting every known reported Eucharist miracle, which generated thousands of views and has since been translated into multiple languages.\n\"For him, it was important to speak about these miracles because Jesus performed Eucharistic miracles,” Acutis’ mother told Sky News.\nHe died in Monza, Italy, and his body was moved to Assisi a year later, where he is on full display, to honor his wish to be buried in the city of St. Francis.\nAside from Acutis, The Pope also advanced sainthood cases for six men and one woman in the Vatican’s announcement last week.

    "title": "How to Implement a Winning SaaS Renewal Strategy",
    "text": "Updated December, 2023\nYou’ve heard the speech about renewals over and over. No one needs to tell you that a\nsuccessful renewal strategy is critical to the growth of a SaaS company. Or that it costs five times more to recruit a new customer than to retain an existing one. However, research shows that many companies are still not giving renewals the focus they deserve. That’s a shame, because really comes down to acknowledging just two facts about why you are losing customers shows that many companies are still not giving renewals the focus they deserve. That’s a shame, because it really comes down to acknowledging just two facts about why you are losing customers.\nWhile there may be a list of possible reasons why customers leave your product, they pretty much fall under these two scenarios:\nYou Have Poor User Adoption\nTo break it down, the goal of the\nuser onboarding experience is to validate what you’ve already sold. The prospect has already converted, signed up for the free trial or purchased the subscription, and they want to be convinced. So, what should you do to optimize your user onboarding process?\nBe aware of your activation criteria.\nThe\nactivation criteria is a task or a series of tasks you suggest to your customers so they will start using your product and benefit from it.\nYou’re basically being proactive and get your customers to warm up to what they’ve purchased. Some good examples for this are:\n- LinkedIn: Connect with these people you may know.\n- Uber: Complete your first ride.\n- Gmail: Send your first email.\nYour activation criteria – sometimes also referred to as “\ngetting to the promise of your product” – comprises the actions your customers take that increase their chances of returning to your product for a second, third or fourth time. Encouraging a new user to do these things is essential for driving long term user adoption because it helps your customer to understand the value of the product and why they’re using it.\nCreate eye-opening moments\nUsers appreciate those aha moments when they discover or are exposed to a feature than can help them complete a task or solve a problem in a novel or smarter way. If possible, you should create as many of these moments as you can throughout the onboarding process.\nHow? You must fully understand the problems and buying decisions of your target audience. Map out their conversion journey based on what you know about their persona and use that data to deliver personalized tips via email, live chat, or within the product itself. App designers often use this method to acquaint new users with their products. Think about the last time you set up a new phone or Google got a redesign. These designers often guide you through the product, revealing functionality you had no idea existed. Create these eye-opening moments for your customers and you’ll not only gain their loyalty, but you’ll get their referrals too.\nEnsure stellar customer service\nNot only do you need to be sure your users can easily contact you via e-mail, on the phone, or within the product, but you need to reach out to them early and often. Not hearing from a customer after they’ve been with you for two weeks isn’t necessarily a good thing: that silence might mean everything is going fine, but it might also mean they’re already disengaged and planning on dropping you. The adoption period is the most important time for your\ncustomer success team to form a relationship with a customer, and answer questions before they even arise.\nRead between the lines of your customers’ behavior in product usage\nThe user adoption process is not limited to only getting your customers to start using your product. This is also a timeframe to keep them engaged so they would want to continue leveraging what you’re offering, establishing a long-term relationship.\nOne key aspect you should consider is identifying your\nat-risk customers. They are the ones that are most likely to quit and target them through re-engagement emails. Remind them about your product/service and give them a reason to stay – great customer service and a great customer experience are what will make or break your relationship.\nThere is a Lack of Perceived Value\nIf you are losing a customer, it most likely is because they’re not seeing the full value of your product . Value is closely related to your onboarding process, like we discussed in the above steps. However, value can diminish over time. Like any relationship, you need to take steps to nurture it.\nConsistently demonstrate value\nAnd not just by having a stellar product. Customers need to see, in concrete terms, what they are getting out of your solution on a regular basis. For instance,\nZendesk, the support ticketing software, regularly sends emails to its customers with stats on how many tickets they’ve solved, and the average ticket response time compared with the previous month. By frequently reminding customers of its value, Zendesk knows few are even going to think about going without it. The bottom line is that concrete numbers can go a long way toward making your solution seem indispensable to your customers.\nInvest in customer marketing, not just in prospects\nAs a general rule of thumb, most businesses dedicate a significant portion of their marketing budget to acquiring new customers. However, just as you nurture your new leads, you also need to nurture your existing customers in order to keep them interested in your product and your company and to increase the likelihood of them\nrenewing their contract.\nBut when is the right time to market to your existing customers? Well, there are a few:\n- New feature announcements.\n- Product updates.\n- When you notice a drop-off in their product usage or activity.\nCustomer marketing is all about keeping your product top of mind and bringing your users back to your product. Make them happy with a new feature or encourage them to keep going with their subscription plan to get ready for success.\nLeverage your user community through social proof\nYour customers need to feel confident in their choice of your product and will collect enough\nsocial proof to support their decision to pay or renew. One of the most effective ways to collect social proof is through effective use of social media channels and showing commitment to it.\nIf you don’t know how to put social proof to good use, don’t worry, we have compiled a list of some of the most popular social proof strategies in eCommerce:\n- Persona Endorsement\n- Reviews and Testimonials\n- Rating Platforms\n- Case Studies\n- Trust Badges\n- Referrals\n- Expert Reviews\nBring customers behind the scenes\nKeep users in the loop when you are developing a new module or functionality. Ask power users to test out new features and provide valuable\nfeedback. This will make them feel like part of the process, as well as provide you with crucial insights. Gain customer loyalty by showing you take their problems, feedback and comments seriously.\nAsk for help: a Subscription Management Platform could be the key\nOne of the biggest challenges that SaaS businesses face is that they have to offer a product or service on a regular basis and be able to collect online payments for those services. Companies often have to deal with frustrations on the part of the users when their subscriptions are not renewed automatically because of issues like expired cards, failed payments and so on.\n2Checkout (now Verifone) can help track closely your subscriptions business using tools such as:\n- Account Updater Service to automatically update customers’ card information\n- Internal Account Updater to increase authorization rates for expired cards\n- Advanced Retry Logic helping to recover failed transactions due to soft declines\n- Dunning Management for recovery in case of hard declines\nBonus: Find out more about optimizing the\n Entire Subscription Lifecycle for your SaaS business growth.\nConclusion\nThe two main culprits of low renewals are poor onboarding experience and a lack of perceived value. If you can proactively engage new users from the start and keep showing them the value of your service, renewals will happen naturally. This is where\ncustomer retention strategies come into play because as competition intensifies and consumer options expand, the importance of retaining your existing customers cannot be overstated.\nAnd don’t forget that it’s not just about keeping customers; it’s about building long-term relationships that will take your business to the next level in the digital world.\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "title": "Guerra Russia-Ucraina, telefonata tra il Papa e Zelensky: “Parlato di pace”. Kiev: “I russi avanzano, dicembre è stato il mese peggiore dell’anno” - La Stampa",
    "text": "In Ucraina è stata una notte di bombardamenti, massicci e assassini: 110 missili, secondo il conteggio ucraino: «Un attacco così massiccio non si vedeva da tempo».\nRaid russi sull'Ucraina, incendi ed esplosioni a Kiev: allerta aerea in tutto il Paese\neri c’è stata una telefonata tra Papa Francesco e il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelensky che riaccende le speranze per un «lavoro congiunto sulla Formula per la Pace». La Russia non ha intenzione di abbassare l'intensità del conflitto e si prepara a combattere almeno per i prossimi cinque anni. Uno scenario allarmante che il presidente russo Vladimir Putin avrebbe descritto al suo omologo cinese Xi Jinping durante la visita di quest'ultimo a Mosca, a marzo di quest'anno. Parole che, secondo le fonti del settimanale giapponese Nikkei, smentirebbero l'apertura del Cremlino a un cessate il fuoco che era stata riportata dal New York Times la settimana scorsa. Sul terreno, dicembre è stato il mese più difficile dell'anno per le forze ucraine, « i russi hanno preso d'assalto Marinka e Avdiivka senza sosta , subendo perdite significative, ma continuando ad avanzare», ha spiegato il portavoce del raggruppamento delle truppe di Tavria, Oleksandr Shtupun. Ma l'esercito di Mosca non si muove solo in queste direzioni e sta cercando di avanzare su sette fronti tra la regione di Donetsk e quella di Lugansk. Il Cremlino prova a riaffermare la sua forza anche sul Mar Nero . Dopo aver subito l'ennesimo raid in Crimea, il Cremlino ha aumentato la pressione dispiegando contemporaneamente tre imbarcazioni da guerra.\nPer approfondire:\nRussia, i ribelli anti-Putin che leggono Orwell Cosa è successo ieri Punti chiave 17:13 Kiev: oggi l’attacco aereo “più pesante della guerra”\n11:46 Von der Leyen: “Sostegno a Kiev per tutto il tempo necessario”\n10:58 Kiev: salito a 22 il numero delle vittime degli ultimi attacchi russi, 108 i feriti\n09:54 Nove morti nei raid russi notturni\n09:42 Zelensky: “110 missili russi sull'Ucraina, risponderemo”\n09:28 Missili su un ospedale ostetrico e un centro commerciale a Dnipro\n08:52 Kiev: “Mai visti tanti missili lanciati contro l'Ucraina”\n07:56 Yermak: “Il mondo capisca che l'Ucraina ne ha bisogno”\n07:19 Esplosioni a Kiev, allarme aereo in tutto il Paese\n07:18 Massiccio attacco russo su Kharkiv\n17:13\nKiev: oggi l’attacco aereo “più pesante della guerra”\nIl ministro della Difesa ucraino, Rustem Umerov, ha definito il vasto attacco russo di oggi sul Paese il più massiccio dall'inizio dell'invasione. «Da molti mesi i russi accumulano missili per questo scopo: attacchi a edifici residenziali, centri commerciali, ospedali. Su pacifiche citta' ucraine. Questo è l'attacco aereo più massiccio di questa guerra», ha scritto il ministro su Facebook. «I russi hanno ucciso e ferito i nostri cittadini e hanno distrutto le infrastrutture. La Russia dimostra ancora e ancora al mondo intero che non ha altro obiettivo che il terrore, l'omicidio, il genocidio degli ucraini», ha denunciato Umerov. Secondo il ministro, la Russia ha accumulato abbastanza missili per continuare attacchi così massicci: «Ovvio che con le riserve di missili di cui dispone lo Stato aggressore, può e continuerà tali attacchi». Umerov ha aggiunto che la leadership ucraina continuerà il dialogo con i suoi alleati sulla fornitura di ulteriori sistemi di difesa aerea a Kiev.\n13:22 Mosca: “Tutti gli obiettivi sono stati colpiti”\nNella settimana dal 23 al 29 dicembre, l'esercito russo ha effettuato 50 attacchi, uno massiccio contro obiettivi delle forze armate e del complesso militare-industriale dell'Ucraina. Lo ha riferito il ministero della Difesa russo, citato da Interfax, osservando che gli attacchi sono stati effettuati anche contro le sedi delle unità delle forze armate ucraine e dei mercenari stranieri. «Tutti gli obiettivi designati sono stati colpiti», ha detto il ministero della Difesa russo. «Nella direzione di Kherson, complessi attacchi di fuoco e azioni preventive da parte delle truppe russe hanno ostacolato i tentativi di trasferire gruppi di sabotaggio delle forze armate ucraine sulle isole e sulla riva sinistra del Dnepr», ha affermato il ministero, «gli attacchi aerei e l'artiglieria hanno danneggiato il personale e l'equipaggiamento della 35esima, 36esima e 38esima Brigata marina, della 124esima, 126esima Brigata di difesa terrestre nelle aree degli insediamenti di Berislav, Tyaginka, Tokarevka, Nikolskoye, Zmievka e Chernobaevka, regione di Kherson». In questa direzione le perdite totali delle forze armate ucraine ammonterebbero a 390 militari, 25 veicoli, 17 imbarcazioni e 22 pezzi di artiglieria da campo\n12:34 Violato lo spazio aereo polacco, Duda convoca i vertici militari\nIl presidente polacco Andrzej Duda ha convocato una riunione urgente con la leadership militare dopo la violazione dello spazio aereo della Polonia da parte di un oggetto volante proveniente dall'Ucraina. Lo riporta la radio polacca Rmf, spiegando che l'oggetto volante è caduto nella zona di Wozuczyn-Cukrownia nel distretto di Hrubieszów. Non è chiaro se si trattasse di un oggetto russo o ucraino. Sull'account ufficiale di X del comando operativo dell'esercito polacco si legge che «questa mattina un oggetto volante non identificato è entrato nello spazio aereo della Repubblica di Polonia dal confine con l'Ucraina e dal momento in cui ha attraversato il confine fino alla scomparsa del segnale è stato seguito dai radar del sistema di difesa aerea del paese». Per questo, «in linea con le procedure, il Comandante operativo delle Forze Armate ha mobilitato le forze e le risorse disponibili».\n12:09 Sunak: “La Russia conferma che il suo obiettivo è sradicare la libertà”\nIl premier britannico Rishi Sunak è convinto che gli ultimi attacchi missilistici di Mosca sull'Ucraina abbiano dimostrato che il presidente Vladimir Putin \"non si fermera' davanti a niente per raggiungere il suo obiettivo di sradicare liberta' e democrazia\". \"Non lo lasceremo vincere - ha scritto Sunak sul suo profilo X - dobbiamo continuare a sostenere l'Ucraina per tutto il tempo che serve\", ha aggiunto.\n11:46 Von der Leyen: “Sostegno a Kiev per tutto il tempo necessario”\n«Siamo stati al fianco dell'Ucraina fin dal primo giorno della guerra di aggressione russa, con quasi 85 miliardi di euro di sostegno finanziario, umanitario e militare. Continueremo a sostenere l'Ucraina per tutto il tempo necessario. E ora stiamo aprendo le porte dell'Ue al nostro amico e vicino». Lo scrive su X la presidente della Commissione Ue, Ursula von der Leyen.\n11:32 Ksenia Fadayeva, collaboratrice di Navalny, condannata a 9 anni di carcere\nIl tribunale russo ha condannato Ksenia Fadeyeva, ex responsabile dell'organizzazione del leader dell'opposizione Alexei Navalny nella città siberiana di Tomsk, a 9 anni di carcere. Lo hanno fatto sapere i suoi sostenitori. Quella contro la sostenitrice di Navalny è solo l'ultima di una serie di pesanti sentenze contro l'opposizione russa, dopo che il Cremlino ha raddoppiato la repressione della società civile dall'inizio della guerra in Ucraina il 24 febraio 2022. Il reato per il quale Fadayeva è stata condannata, riferiscono i suoi sostenitori sui social media, è quello di estremismo, annunciando che la difesa farà appello alla Corte suprema. Ksenia Fadeyeva era a capo dell'ufficio politico di Navalny a Tomsk, proprio dove il leader dell'opposizione è stato avvelenato nell'agosto 2020 durante una visita preelettorale. Fadeyeva venne poi eletta nella legislatura della citta' di Tomsk nel 2020, in quella che fu considerata una vittoria dell'opposizione russa contro il governo del presidente Vladimir Putin. Nel 2021, però, le autorità hanno etichettato il gruppo come «organizzazione estremista», rendendo perseguibili i suoi membri e sostenitori. Molti degli alleati di Navalny hanno lasciato la Russia, ma Fadeyeva si è rifiutata di fuggire ed è stata arrestata nel dicembre 2021\n10:58 Kiev: salito a 22 il numero delle vittime degli ultimi attacchi russi, 108 i feriti\nSono almeno 18 i civili rimasti uccisi in Ucraina nell'ultima raffica di raid aerei russi, mentre almeno 108 persone sono rimaste ferite e un numero al momento non noto di altre persone sono rimaste sepolte sotto le macerie. Lo riferiscono le autorità locali ucraine. Secondo l'aeronautica militare ucraina, si tratta del più grande attacco aereo russo in 22 mesi di guerra. Sono state colpite diverse città in tutto il Paese, fra cui la capitale Kiev, Leopoli, Odessa, Dnipro, Kharkiv e Zaporizhzhia. Fra gli edifici danneggiati negli attacchi ci sono una clinica ostetrica, condomini e scuole.\n10:57 Esercito ucraino: 158 tra missili e droni lanciati dai russi\nL'Ucraina è stata attaccata nelle scorse ore da 158 tra missili e droni lanciati dalle forze armate russe. Lo ha denunciato l'esercito di Kiev parlando di «un attacco militare massiccio». Il comandante in capo delle forze armate ucraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, ha spiegato che in base ai risultati preliminari si è visto che i militari russi hanno utilizzato dapprima i metodi ''tradizionali'', ovvero i cosiddetti droni kamikaze di fabbricazione iraniana, i Shahed. Successivamente i militari russi hanno lanciato contro l'Ucraina almeno 55 missili da crociera, 14 missili balistici, cinque missili aerobalistici e altri missili anti radar. Zaluzhnyi ha affermato che le forze armate dell'Ucraina hanno abbattuto 27 dei 36 droni lanciati dalla Russia, oltre a 87 missili.\n10:26 Kuleba: “Mosca parla con i missili, ci servono più aiuti”\n«Solo una maggiore potenza di fuoco può mettere a tacere il terrorismo russo». Lo ha scritto in un post su X il ministro degli Esteri ucraino Dmitro Kuleba, confermando che «circa 110 missili russi e numerosi droni sono stati utilizzati per colpire i civili in Ucraina. Sono stati presi di mira un reparto maternità, scuole, ospedali, edifici residenziali e strutture commerciali». Kuleba ha scritto che «oggi milioni di ucraini si sono svegliati al forte rumore delle esplosioni. Vorrei che il rumore delle esplosioni in Ucraina potesse essere sentito in tutto il mondo. In tutte le principali capitali, sedi centrali e parlamenti, che attualmente stanno discutendo di un ulteriore sostegno all'Ucraina. In tutte le redazioni che scrivono di ''stanchezza'' o che la Russia è presumibilmente pronta per i ''negoziati''. Questi suoni sono ciò che la Russia ha veramente da dire. La nostra unica risposta collettiva può e deve essere un'assistenza militare e finanziaria continua, solida e a lungo termine all'Ucraina».\n10:23 Onu: “Attacco russo inaccettabile, prova sofferenze al popolo”\nGli attacchi russi sull'Ucraina delle scorse ore, che hanno ucciso una decina di persone ferendone decine di altre in tutto il Paese, sono «un altro esempio inaccettabile dell'orribile realtà che deve affrontare il popolo ucraino, che ha reso il 2023 un altro anno di enormi sofferenze». Lo ha dichiarato la responsabile umanitaria dell'Onu in Ucraina, Denise Brown.\n10:13 Estonia: “Mosca minaccia la pace mondiale, sostenere Kiev”\n«Il mondo deve sostenere l'Ucraina fino alla vittoria e autorizzare un tribunale speciale a giudicare Mosca per i crimini commessi in Ucraina». Lo scrive il ministero degli Esteri dell'Estonia in un messaggio, pubblicato sul proprio account X, in cui condanna gli attacchi compiuti oggi dalla Russia contro le infrastrutture civili ucraine. «Questo è il modo in cui la Russia fascista si sta vendicando per la distruzione della flotta del mar Nero», ha detto stamane il presidente della commissione Esteri del Parlamento estone (Riigikogu), Marko Mihkelson. Il politico estone ha inoltre esortato gli alleati a fornire all'Ucraina la maggior quantità di armamenti moderni possibile per sconfiggere «una delle maggiori minacce alla stabilità del mondo dei nostri giorni».\n09:54 Nove morti nei raid russi notturni\nSono almeno 9 le persone rimaste uccise in Ucraina nei raid russi avvenuti nelle prime ore del mattino. Lo riferisce l'Ukrainska Pravda, citando dati raccolti da diverse autorità locali. Esplosioni sono avvenute a Kiev, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, nonché Odessa, Kharkiv, Leopoli e nella regione di Khmelnitsky. L'emittente Suspilne riferisce che a Dnipro una clinica ostetrica è stata danneggiata da un razzo, in particolare con finestre rotte, ma che qui non sono state registrate vittime. A Kiev il sindaco Vitali Klychko ha riferito di 2 morti; nella regione di Dnipropetrovsk il bilancio riferito dal governatore Serhiy Lysak è di 4 morti e decine di feriti; una donna è morta inoltre nella regione di Zaporizhzhia, secondo quanto riferito dal governatore Yury Malashko; e 2 morti e 15 feriti sono stati registrati nella regione di Odessa, come riferito dal governatore Oleg Kiper.\n09:42 Zelensky: “110 missili russi sull'Ucraina, risponderemo”\n«Un totale di circa 110 missili sono stati lanciati contro l'Ucraina, causando morti e feriti», nel massiccio attacco russo di stanotte. Lo scrive il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelensky su X, ribadendo che «oggi, la Russia ha usato quasi ogni tipo di arma del suo arsenale: Kindzhal, S-300s, missili da crociera e droni. Bombardieri strategici hanno lanciato missili X-101/X-505». «Risponderemo agli attacchi terroristici. E continueremo a combattere per la sicurezza del nostro intero Paese, di ogni città e di ogni cittadino. Il terrore russo deve perdere e perderà», aggiunge.\n09:28 Missili su un ospedale ostetrico e un centro commerciale a Dnipro\nMissili lanciati dalle forze armate russe hanno colpito un ospedale ostetrico e un centro commerciale a Dnipro, in Ucraina. Lo ha confermato il primo ministro ucraino Denys Shmyhal spiegando che nell'attacco missilistico sono state uccise quattro persone.\n08:52 Kiev: “Mai visti tanti missili lanciati contro l'Ucraina”\nSecondo le prime informazioni delle autorità ucraine dopo il devastante attacco russo su diverse città ucraine, due persone sono morte a Kharkiv e a Leopoli, molte sono rimaste ferite, ci sono danni e distruzioni, palazzi in fiamme in diverse regioni, numerose esplosioni. «Non abbiamo mai visto così tanti missili contemporaneamente sui nostro monitor», ha detto il portavoce dell'Aeronautica militare ucraina Yuriy Ihnat, «sono stati lanciati Daggers, missili balistici, S-300, missili da crociera, UAV, X-22 o X-32. Circa 18 bombardieri strategici hanno tirato X-101-X-505».\n07:56 Yermak: “Il mondo capisca che l'Ucraina ne ha bisogno”\n«Massiccio attacco terroristico, i razzi volano di nuovo sulle nostre città e i civili vengono presi di mira. L'Ucraina ha bisogno di sostegno. Saremo ancora più forti, stiamo facendo di tutto per rafforzare il nostro scudo aereo. Ma il mondo deve capire che abbiamo bisogno di più sostegno e forza per fermare questo terrore». Lo ha scritto su Telegram il consigliere presidenziale ucraino Andry Yermak dopo la pesante ondata di attacchi russi nella notte su moltre città ucraine, compresa la capitale Kiev.\n07:24 Kiev: “Siamo interessati ad addestrare piloti militari in Francia”\nL'Ucraina è interessata ad addestrare i suoi piloti militari in Francia: lo ha reso noto il ministero della Difesa di Kiev, come riporta Ukrinform. Nel corso di un incontro con una delegazione del Senato francese, il viceministro della Difesa ucraino, tenente generale Ivan Havryliuk, ha sottolineato l'interesse di Kiev per la formazione dei piloti militari ucraini in Francia, in particolare per aumentare il numero dei siti di addestramento del personale tecnico e di supporto per la manutenzione degli aerei di tipo occidentale. Havryliuk ha inoltre osservato che il Paese ha bisogno di ulteriori missili guidati antiaerei e di attrezzature di ricognizione radar, soprattutto per individuare e distruggere i missili balistici russi.\n07:22 “Abbattuto un drone russo su Odessa, incendio in un grattacielo”\n«I rottami di un drone abbattuto hanno danneggiato un grattacielo a Odessa, è scoppiato un incendio. I soccorritori sono al lavoro. Le informazioni sulle vittime sono da chiarire». Lo ha riferito su Telegram Oleh Kiper, capo dell'amministrazione militare regionale di Odessa, secondo quanto riportato da Ukrinform. È successo durante un attacco con droni russi sulla città ucraina. Il capo della Rma ha sottolineato che l'attacco è ancora in corso e ha invitato i cittadini di Odessa e gli abitanti della regione a non trascurare la sicurezza e a rimanere nei rifugi.\n07:19 Esplosioni a Kiev, allarme aereo in tutto il Paese\nSi sono udite diverse esplosioni oggi a Kiev e il sindaco della capitale ucraina, Vitali Klitschko, ha invitato i cittadini a mettersi al riparo alle 7.35 ora locale. Le difese aeree sono al lavoro. Lo riferisce The Kyiv Independent, secondo cui la Russia nella notte ha lanciato una raffica di missili e droni contro diverse città in tutta l'Ucraina. Sei esplosioni di missili S-300, stando ai media locali, sono state registrate a Kharkiv mentre la Russia continua a colpire l'area con attacchi aerei. A Lviv, nell'Ucraina occidentale, sono state registrate esplosioni dovute ad attacchi di droni mentre le difese aeree operavano in città.

    "text": "( MENAFN - Khaleej Times) Published: Thu 5 Sep 2024, 7:04 PM\nLast updated: Thu 5 Sep 2024, 7:05 PM\nJapan cruised to a winning start in the third phase of Asia's preliminaries for the 2026 World Cup as Hajime Moriyasu's side thrashed China 7-0 at Saitama Stadium on Thursday.\nWataru Endo and Kaoru Mitoma gave Japan a two-goal lead at the interval in the Group C clash before Takumi Minamino hit a second-half brace.\nJunya Ito, Daizen Maeda and Takefusa Kubo added to the scoreline as China were comprehensively outplayed.\nThe Japanese have been slow starters in the final phase of Asia's qualifiers in recent years but there was little that was sluggish about Hajime Moriyasu's side against an outclassed China.\nEndo put Japan in front in the 12th minute after Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei had kept out Ritsu Doan's header seconds earlier.\nThe Liverpool midfielder was left unmarked at the resulting corner and he made no mistake when Kubo delivered the ball, scoring with a clinical header.\nDoan went close to adding a second in the 33rd minute while Hidemasa Morita hit the side-netting with two minutes left in the half.\nThe Japanese did manage to double their lead before the interval, Mitoma meeting Doan's curling centre to head the ball back across the helpless Wang.\nSeven minutes into the second half Moriyasu's side extended their lead when Mitoma's pass released Minamino into the penalty area and the Monaco forward bent his strike beyond Wang.\nMinamino claimed his second of the night six minutes later with a perfect finish into the bottom corner that left Wang sprawled on the Saitama Stadium turf.\nSubstitute Ito claimed the fifth 13 minutes from time when his shot was deflected past Wang by Jiang Guangtai and then set up Maeda to head in the sixth in the 87th minute.\nKubo lashed the ball into the roof of the net in injury time to complete China's embarrassment.\nThe top two finishers in the group, which also features Australia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Bahrain, will advance automatically to the World Cup while the third and fourth placed teams will progress to a further round of qualifiers.\nAsia has been given eight guaranteed places at the 2026 finals, with the possibility of a further place via an intercontinental playoff.\nALSO READ:\nHeroic Palestine hold South Korea to goalless draw in World Cup qualifier Bahrain stun 10-man Australia in World Cup qualifier\nMENAFN05092024000049011007ID1108642184",

    "text": "Viols et agressions sexuelles dans l'Eglise : l'ancien prêtre d'Orléans condamné à 17 ans de réclusion Par La Provence (avec AFP)\nPublié le 25/05/24 à 12:46 - Mis à jour le 25/05/24 à 12:46\nLe tribunal a jugé Marwane coupable des faits qui lui étaient reprochés.\nPhoto A.T. (illustration)\nL'ancien prêtre d'Orléans a été reconnu coupable de centaines de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées sur quatre garçons et condamné à 17 ans de réclusion criminelle, ce samedi 25 mai par la cour d'assises du Loiret. L'accusé, Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, 64 ans, a été reconnu \" coupable de l'ensemble des faits de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées \", a déclaré la cour. Elle a annoncé une période de sûreté de 10 ans qui va au-delà des réquisitions de l'avocat général. La veille, devant une salle interdite et suspendue à ses paroles, l'ancien prêtre - renvoyé à l'état laïc à sa demande - a \" reconnu tout sans réserve \".\n\" Je reconnais, puisqu'il faut utiliser les mots, les attouchements, les caresses, les fellations, les pénétrations digitales et péniennes, l'ensemble des faits \", a-t-il déclaré. Suivant les réquisitions, la cour a également condamné l'accusé à un \" suivi socio-judiciaire \", \" une injonction de soins \", \" l'interdiction d'exercer toute activité professionnelle ou bénévole impliquant un contact avec des mineurs \", entre autres.\n\" Ce qui est frappant c'est que les actes, les noms (des victimes) font masse \", avait déploré l'avocat général. Dans un rare exercice de confessions vendredi, l'accusé a également avoué, pour la première fois, des viols et agressions sexuelles sur deux autres victimes dès 1982 - des faits qui n'ont pu être jugés en raison de la prescription. Samedi matin, son conseil, Me Damien Brossier, a appelé la cour à la mansuétude soulignant que son client \" n'est plus un danger \", et qu'\" on en peut pas être condamné à 64 ans comme à 37 ans, l'âge est passé, l'usure est passée et du temps s'est écoulé sans infraction \" depuis les faits condamnés.\nÀ lire aussi : À Nice, un prêtre meurt avant son procès pour agressions sexuelles \"La gangrène\" Les faits jugés remontent aux années 1990 et 2000 lorsque Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, ordonné prêtre en 1989, se lie aux parents de ses victimes, une fratrie de trois, s'invitant régulièrement à leur table, restant dormir dans la chambre de l'aîné, qui sera agressé et violé dès ses 9 ans. \" La gangrène, c'est Olivier de Scitivaux parce qu'il s'est introduit partout dans la famille \", a dénoncé l'avocate d'une des victimes, Me Clémence Lemarchand.\nA leur domicile, pendant que les parents dorment au rez-de-chaussée, dans les demeures somptueuses de la famille Scitivaux, l'hiver au chalet à Abondance (Haute-Savoie) ou l'été en colonie de vacances à Perros-Guirec (Côtes-d'Armor), celui qui avait à l'époque 22 à 25 ans de plus que les victimes (âgées de 7 à 9 ans) va leur infliger des violences.\nÀ lire aussi : Violence sexuelle dans l'Eglise : le Vatican blanchit un cardinal canadien Devant une salle d'audience comble, dans laquelle de nombreux responsables de l'Eglise catholique et paroissiens ont pris place depuis mardi, les trois frères et un ami ont raconté à tour de rôle, avec minutie et pudeur, les sévices qu'ils recevaient chacun leur tour, sans savoir que les autres étaient également victimes.\n\" Quand il n'y en avait pas un de disponible, il y avait le deuxième ou le troisième \", a confirmé l'ancien prêtre, désignant ainsi les trois frères, des quadragénaires aujourd'hui unis sur le banc des victimes. \" Regardez bien ses mains \", a invectivé le cadet de la fratrie, \" ce sont dans ses mains que j'ai éjaculé la première fois, ce sont ses mains qui donnent l'eucharistie \".\nLe benjamin a lui raconté, devant une cour interdite, ces quelques mois où il \" y pass(ait) toutes les semaines, tous les jours, tous les soirs \", \" le moment où il a utilisé des outils sur mon corps \" ou lorsqu'\" il m'a rasé \". Les faits se sont produits jusqu'au début des années 2000. Pourtant, les premières alertes sont émises par des animateurs et familles auprès du diocèse dès les années 80, des familles ou des animatrices de l'aumônerie en 1998.

En France, un rapport rendu en octobre 2021 estime qu'en 70 ans, environ 330 000 personnes ont été agressées au sein de l'Eglise lorsqu'elles étaient mineures .\nEn continu\n12:31\nAprès un nouveau tour de vis sur les Airbnb, vers une saison estivale test pour la ville de Cassis",

    "text": "India’s Strategic Expansion: 50 New Satellites to Boost Geo-Intelligence\nIn a striking move to expand its space-based assets, India plans to launch 50 new satellites over the next five years. The initiative, led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), aims to develop a sophisticated satellite network to enhance the country’s geo-intelligence. The operation is set to address the strategic necessities such as monitoring border movements and comprehensively imaging landscapes for national security.\n**Summary**: Aiming to scale its space capabilities, India, through ISRO’s leadership, is set to enhance its satellite fleet. This strategic push involves deploying 50 advanced satellites to facilitate better geo-intelligence, particularly in monitoring borders and ensuring national security.\nISRO’s chairman, S Somanath notes the inadequacy of India’s current 54-satellite fleet to meet the growing aspirations of a global power. He underscores the necessity of a tenfold increase to tackle the intelligence and security demands effectively. Through a combination of varied orbital placements—geostationary, lower earth, and very low earth orbits—ISRO intends to establish a multi-orbit framework, ensuring thorough and expansive surveillance capabilities.\nSomanath also stresses the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve satellites’ observational efficiency. Anticipating a data-centric approach, the objective is to minimize irrelevant data downloads and foster real-time intersatellite communication for better coordination and rapid intelligence gathering.\nThe slated deployment underlines a significant enhancement of imaging capabilities, allowing India to monitor its vast territories, especially border areas, daily. This surge in geo-intelligence is a clear testament to India’s commitment to fortify its position as a formidable nation in the global arena.\nFAQ Section\nWhat is India’s goal with the launch of 50 new satellites?\nIndia aims to strengthen its satellite network to enhance the country’s geo-intelligence, particularly for monitoring border movements and ensuring national security.\nHow will the new satellites improve India’s existing capabilities?\nThe deployment of these advanced satellites is expected to offer better geo-intelligence with a tenfold increase in surveillance capacity, employing a variety of orbital positions and cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence for more efficient observation.\nWhat are the expected orbits for the new satellites?\nIndia’s ISRO plans to place satellites in geostationary, lower earth, and very low earth orbits to establish a multi-orbit framework for comprehensive surveillance.\nHow is technology like artificial intelligence anticipated to aid these satellites?\nArtificial intelligence is anticipated to improve observational efficiency, minimize the transfer of irrelevant data, and enhance real-time intersatellite communication, thereby enabling quicker and more coordinated intelligence gathering.\nWhat are the strategic benefits for India with this expansion?\nThe strategic benefits include improved imaging capabilities to monitor the nation’s vast territories on a daily basis, which is vital for maintaining security and demonstrating India’s fortified position on the global stage.\nDefinitions\n– Geo-intelligence (GEOINT): The use of satellite imagery, GIS, and geographical information to analyze and describe features on Earth for strategic purposes.\n– Geostationary Orbits: A circular orbit around the Earth’s equator at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers, where the satellite’s orbit period matches the Earth’s rotation, allowing it to remain stationary over a single point.\n– Lower Earth Orbits (LEO): Orbits relatively close to the Earth, typically between 160 to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth.\n– Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO): Orbits that are below the conventional LEO altitude, closer to the Earth’s surface, potentially increasing the resolution and quality of imaging.\n– Intersatellite Communication: The direct communication link between satellites, enabling the exchange of data without the need to relay it through ground stations.\nRelated Links\n– For more information on the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), visit\nISRO.\n– To learn about artificial intelligence advancements, access\nArtificial Intelligence Association.\n– For more on geo-intelligence and its applications, explore\nUnited States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation.\nMichał Rogucki is a pioneering figure in the field of renewable energy, particularly known for his work on solar power innovations.
