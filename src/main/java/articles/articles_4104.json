    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — The Austin City Limits (ACL) Music Festival is looking at new ways to be sustainable, and this year, that means powering one stage in a way they’ve never done before that’s set to save fuel and cut down on emissions. The IHG Hotel and Resorts Stage, as well as some backstage areas and lounges, will be powered by a hybrid-battery system. C3P Presents, the event management company that puts on ACL Music Festival, compared the system to a hybrid car. “There’s batteries that are paired with a generator, diesel generator engines that are running on biodiesel, and the batteries are powering everything,” said Jake Perry, the Director of Operations and Sustainability for C3 Presents. When battery power starts to run low, generators will automatically kick on until the batteries are fully charged again. They say the process results in about a 60-75% reduction in runtimes, which reduces their overall emissions. “We're doing everything we can to both bring this world class festival to Austin and limit our impact as much as possible,” Perry said. Typically, since music festivals happen in locations like parks that don’t have typical power infrastructure, most stages have to be powered by diesel generators. The festival, along with C3 Presents, have been partnering with REVERB’s Music Decarbonization Project, testing out this technology for about a year. C3 used it for the first time at this year's Lollapalooza. Now this will be the first time it’s used at ACL. “We care about the people that come and enjoy our shows and work on our shows, and we want to see a world and an industry in which we have longevity and we can control some of the emissions issues that we may be having,” Perry said. Since the technology is fairly new, Perry says it still comes with a high price tag. But they’re hopeful that as more festivals start using it, it will become a more common practice. “As we are investing in it, as our partners like Reverb are investing in it, as other people in the industry are investing in it, the demand continues to rise, but the investment in turn makes more supply readily available to us,” Perry said. Even though it is costly, it’s something important that C3 wants to invest in for the future of their music festivals, especially here in Austin to preserve Zilker Park.",

    "title": "House where 4 University of Idaho students were killed is demolished - OPB",
    "text": "The house where four University of Idaho students were [killed last year](https://apnews.com/article/idaho-pennsylvania-indiana-education-homicide-9051569249b988b5afaa2414aa3f9bc8) was demolished Thursday, marking an emotional step for the victims’ families and a close-knit community that was shocked and devastated by the brutal stabbings. The sounds of construction equipment pierced the early morning air as an excavator started tearing down the front part of the house. The former walls formed a large pile of crushed and smashed wood on the ground as debris was picked up and loaded into a dump truck. A few onlookers joined dozens of members of the news media. After about three hours, the home was fully demolished and its concrete foundation had been broken up. Multiple dump trucks continued to remove debris from the site. The owner of the rental home near the university campus in Moscow, Idaho, donated it to the university earlier this year. It has since been boarded up and blocked off by a security fence. Students Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves were fatally stabbed there in November 2022. School officials, who in February [announced plans to raze the house](https://apnews.com/article/colleges-and-universities-idaho-880b83391a0b356e4c97d9571feba4d9), view the demolition as a key step toward healing and finding closure, university spokesperson Jodi Walker said. “It's incredibly powerful and emotional to see it come down,” she said as she watched the demolition. “We've turned into that next chapter, whatever that next chapter is, and that definitely is a bit of a relief.” Moscow resident Lilly Topping, who lives on a neighboring street and could see the house from her window, also said she felt relieved as she passed by the demolition. She said she had felt unsafe for a time after the killings, and her grandparents gave her a door stopper to place underneath her door knob as a precaution against break-ins. “You could just feel the presence of sadness,” she said. “It was just a tragic event, and I feel like we need to renew everything.\" The fence that had surrounded the property is set to be reinstalled Thursday night and will stay up for about a week, until contractors return to grade and level the site so that it can be planted with grass at some point, Walker said. There are currently no other plans for the site, though the university may revisit that in the future, she said.

[Bryan Kohberger](https://apnews.com/article/university-of-idaho-students-killings-arrest-b3b1ffd8138827f0bdad16d20e17cf83), a former criminology graduate student at Washington State University in neighboring Pullman, Washington, has been charged with four counts of murder. A judge entered a [not-guilty plea](https://apnews.com/article/university-students-moscow-idaho-stabbings-kohberger-trial-1a827523479835293356998b51a1d897) on Kohberger's behalf earlier this year. The concerns from victims' families previously prompted the university to push back its timeline for demolition. After initially announcing the plan in February, the school in July said it would pause the process and revisit it in October. “On the one hand, some people want it taken down. It is a constant reminder of the heinous acts that went on inside it. It is also a place that continues to draw unwanted attention from media, YouTubers and others,” university President Scott Green wrote in a July memo. “On the other hand, it elicits deep emotional responses from those who are working through grief and who fear that its destruction could impact the court case. We hear all these arguments, take them seriously and weigh them against the greater good for our university.” Prosecutors, [who hope to try Kohberger next summer](https://apnews.com/article/idaho-kohberger-trial-dates-58258a8d58f1d30cd7e1afe31d07db3d), told university officials in an email that they don’t anticipate needing the house any further, as they were already able to gather measurements necessary for creating illustrative exhibits for a jury. They added that a jury visit to the site wouldn’t be authorized given that the current condition of the house “is so substantially different” than at the time of the killings. The Latah County prosecuting attorney’s office declined to comment, citing a [gag order](https://apnews.com/article/kohberger-gag-order-idaho-killings-first-amendment-13eb9c5a669323bb4a71eb27ee086554) from an Idaho judge that restricts what lawyers in the case can say to the news media. Kohberger's defense team was given [access to the home earlier this month](https://apnews.com/article/idaho-students-killed-university-kohberger-home-demolish-2e55293f26f8ca7a6e4119cb61382576) to gather photos, measurements and other documentation. And in October, the FBI gathered at the house to collect data that could be used to create visual aids for jurors at the upcoming trial. Related: [Suspect in Idaho homicides returns to court this week](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/01/12/suspect-moscow-idaho-homicides-court/) Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves lived together in the rental home just across the street from campus. Chapin — Kernodle’s boyfriend — was there visiting on the night of the attack. All of them were friends and members of the university's Greek system. The killings left many of their classmates and residents of Moscow reeling with grief and fear. Moscow is a rural farming and college town of about 26,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-central Idaho, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Spokane, Washington. ___ Rush reported from Portland, Oregon.",

    "title": "Stock Advisor Websites for Investors",
    "text": "Stock advisor websites provide individual investors with useful tools, research and guidance to build their wealth. Many investors count on these handy online sources for ideas and information on markets and individual securities. These sites offer stock screeners to identify opportunities, articles analyzing specific companies, model portfolios showing how to construct a diversified mix of holdings and communities to exchange ideas. Consider getting personalized guidance on stock investing from a qualified\nfinancial advisor.\nWhat Stock Advisor Websites Do\nStock advisor websites help average investors learn about\nputting money into stocks. They can show people which stocks seem to be priced below what they are really worth. Some advisor sites also point out risks of possible money-losing stocks. Several allow you to search for stocks meeting certain criteria important to you.\nMany advisor platforms provide model\ninvestment portfolios to demonstrate methods for mixing different types of investments. Additionally, these sites frequently have investing tips and education for beginners. On sites that allow users to exchange messages, the online communities that develop can provide insight and peer support.\n5 Stock Advisor Websites\nA large number of websites offer advice on stock investing. The quality and focus of these sites can vary widely. Some supply broadly applicable content generated by experienced professionals and vetted by experts. Others may consist of uninformed ramblings of amateurs, often on topics of little interest to average investors.\nThe good ones can be well worth a visit and many investors rely on them heavily for assistance. To help you get started with some quality sources, here are five stock advisor websites for investors:\nThis one offers easy-to-use stock screening tools to build portfolios matching your strategy. Morningstar’s analyst ratings on stocks and funds enable investors to home in on highly rated names.\nKnown for stock ideas across many categories and themes. Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor service claims its recommendations have beaten S&P 500 substantially over time. Beginners benefit from Motley Fool’s plain language education.\nComplete information on dividend-paying stocks makes this site appealing to investors pursuing income strategies. Easily see upcoming dividend payout dates, amounts and a company’s history of rising dividends.\nA good source of numerous articles doing deep dives analyzing individual stocks, SeekingAlpha’s marketplace of contributors results in a wide range of recommendations.\nValue investors are likely to appreciate this site’s estimated fair values of stocks calculated from discounted cash flows. Users can modify assumptions like growth rates to model different scenarios.\nWhen Stock Advisor Sites Fall Short\nAlthough advisor websites provide useful input and ideas for stock research, they also have drawbacks. If a site concentrates on one philosophy like value metrics or dividends, for instance, it may not present other viewpoints.\nMany sites provide free information. However, some platforms price premium memberships at well over $100 monthly. This limits their accessibility for many beginning investors.\nFollowing model portfolios from sites exactly can also carry risks if they don’t fit your situation. And, as is always the case, past performance doesn’t predict future returns. Eye-catching claims of huge past returns some sites claim could have been due to positive market trends and good luck more than stock-picking skill.\nChoosing Stock Advisor Websites\nRather than relying on a single stock advisor platform, consider utilizing multiple respected sites. Try to identify sites that offer different perspectives and tools and that cater to and complement the type of investments you actually make.\nFor instance, value investors can leverage Morningstar ratings plus ValueInvesting.io’s cash flow estimates. Income-focused investors may couple Dividend.com for payout details with Motley Fool recommendations across sectors. Newcomers seeking education plus stock ideas can turn to Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha articles.\nCheck a potential stock pick against various site to generate a balanced view of its prospects. This is the same idea as talking to a range of experts rather than listening to just one voice. Investors should ultimately analyze stocks independently too, instead of following advisors blindly without question.\nBottom Line\nStock advisor websites supply individual investors helpful services like screening for opportunities, evaluating stocks and presenting model portfolios. Leading platforms providing valuation estimates, risk assessments and diverse opinions can further success. However only depending on simple stock picks or ignoring bigger picture can mean missing out. Checking multiple trusted sites while staying thoughtfully engaged helps everyday investors access these powerful online tools.\nInvestment Tips for Beginners\n- A\nfinancial advisorcan suggest reputable online stock information providers with options tailored for you and supply hands-on, personalized advice. SmartAsset’s free toolmatches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n- Project how much your portfolio will be worth over time using SmartAsset’s\ninvestment growth and return calculator.\nPhoto credit: ©iStock/Milan_Jovic, ©iStock/Morningstar Investor, ©iStock/The Motley Fool, ©iStock/Dividend.com, ©iStock/SeekingAlpha, ©iStock/ValueInvesting.io, ©iStock/BalanceFormcreative",
