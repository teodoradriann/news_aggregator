    "title": "Mujeres y hombres necesitan desayunos diferentes",
    "text": "Cereales, huevos, croissants… Cuando desayunas, es muy probable que comas más o menos lo mismo. Sin embargo, esto no es necesariamente bueno. Investigadores de la Universidad de Waterloo en Canadá descubrieron que las mujeres y los hombres deberían desayunar de forma diferente. Como parte de este estudio, publicado en la revista especializada “Computers in Biology and Medicine”, el equipo de investigadores desarrolló un modelo informático. Se basó en datos de varios experimentos en los que a hombres y mujeres se les sirvió un desayuno diferente cada vez, con cantidades de grasa que oscilaban entre 17 y 45 gramos y cantidades de carbohidratos que oscilaban entre 58 y 289 gramos. Las mujeres tienen más probabilidades de almacenar grasa que los hombres, pero también la queman más rápidamente para transformarla en energía. Los carbohidratos, por otro lado, son una mejor fuente de energía para los hombres. Esto se explica por las diferencias en el metabolismo entre ambos sexos. Los huevos revueltos aportan proteínas y grasas buenas. El aguacate es rico en ácidos grasos insaturados, fibra y vitaminas. El salmón es rico en omega 3 que tiene un efecto antiinflamatorio. Las semillas de chía contienen omega 3, fibra y proteínas. El yogur o sus alternativas vegetales a base de coco, por ejemplo, contienen grasas buenas. La avena es una gran fuente de carbohidratos complejos. Se pueden comer con frutas y frutos secos o como muesli sin azúcar. El pan integral es rico en fibra y carbohidratos. Los panqueques integrales son una alternativa saludable a los panqueques de harina blanca y son ricos en fibra. Los investigadores señalan que tenían muchos más datos sobre hombres que sobre mujeres. Por lo tanto, existe una necesidad urgente de realizar una investigación más profunda sobre el metabolismo de las mujeres para poder hacer recomendaciones nutricionales aún más relevantes en el futuro.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analysts Caution Against Missing Out As BTC May Surge To $500k With ETF Launch",
    "text": "As the Bitcoin price has regained previously lost territory, following reports suggesting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would reject the long-awaited Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new developments have reignited hopes among investors. Although the approval of these index funds is not expected to occur on Friday, sources indicate that the upcoming week may bring positive news. ETF Approval To Drive Gradual Bitcoin Price Surge To $500,000 FOX journalist Eleanor Terret reports that amended 19b-4 filings and last-minute phone calls regarding comments on S-1s and possible launch dates are expected in the coming days. While approvals seem likely in the next week, according to Terret, the timeline ultimately depends on the SEC’s ability to review the comments and amendments submitted efficiently. Terret describes the current situation as a meticulous process of “dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” emphasizing the attention to detail required for regulatory clearance. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record On the other hand, crypto analyst Adam Cochran offers valuable insights into the potential impact of Bitcoin ETFs, as all signs point to the imminent approval of these investment products. Cochran suggests that many may “overestimate” the short-term effects of ETF approval while underestimating its long-term implications. In the immediate aftermath, market flows may not witness a significant surge. However, Cochran believes that investment advisors will review their clients’ portfolios over the next year and recommend diversifying even a small percentage, such as 1%, into the ETF. Cochran emphasizes that the Bitcoin price performance, with a remarkable 157% return in the latter half of 2023, will be a key factor driving investor interest. Cochran envisions a gradual upward trajectory for the Bitcoin price, characterized by persistent growth and occasional market volatility. Ultimately, Cochran’s long-term forecast indicates a potential Bitcoin price surge to $500,000 per coin, leaving sidelined investors regretfully waiting for a substantial market correction. Cochran further noted: Also, ETFs result in spot buys, not leverage, which improves system health. And are long-term holders, less likely to sell volatility. So it creates a slow grind up of underlying market health. Like the best DCA you could ask for. Bitcoin ETF Pricing Potential Not Fully Realized Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that the pricing potential of a Bitcoin ETF may not have been fully realized, providing insight into the current state of the Bitcoin market. Martinez points to a decline in the estimated leverage ratio across all exchanges, reaching a two-year low. This indicates that Bitcoin traders are adopting a more cautious approach, reducing their use of borrowed funds as they await regulatory clarity on the ETF. Related Reading: Ethereum Mega Whales Continue To Buy: Do They Know Something You Don’t? Furthermore, Martinez emphasizes the significance of Bitcoin’s price above $41,800. According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its position above $41,800 is crucial for establishing a bullish outlook. This level is reinforced by approximately 2.41 million addresses holding over 1 million BTC, creating a substantial support zone. The significant number of addresses with substantial Bitcoin holdings suggests a strong interest in maintaining the cryptocurrency’s value and provides a foundation for market stability. Martinez notes that the resistance levels ahead for Bitcoin appear relatively minor. This implies that fewer significant barriers are impeding potential price increases. With reduced resistance, the market conditions become more favorable for stable or rising prices, further supporting the bullish sentiment.

    "title": "Venezuela in military exercise over British warship ‘threat’ - Gulf Times",
    "text": "Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in a “defensive” exercise, in response to Britain sending a warship to waters off Guyana.Maduro said he was launching “a joint action of a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country.”Britain said Sunday it would divert the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, a former British colony, amid the South American country’s simmering territorial dispute with neighbouring Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region.A Guyana foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that the ship was due to arrive Friday and would be in its territory for “less than a week” for open sea defence exercises. The ship will not dock in Georgetown.The television broadcast accompanying Maduro’s announcement showed fighter jets participating in the Venezuelan exercise, as well as ships and ocean patrol vessels.The Venezuelan government earlier asked Guyana, in a statement, “to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the HMS Trent, and to refrain from involving military powers in the territorial controversy.”Maduro claims that Essequibo — which makes up about two-thirds of Guyana’s territory — is actually Venezuelan land, a decades-old contention that has flared since massive oil deposits were found in its waters.The flare-up has raised fears in the region of a potential conflict over the remote area of 160,000sq km (62,000 square miles). The South American neighbours agreed earlier this month not to resort to force to settle the dispute, during a meeting between Maduro and Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali.“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,” said Maduro.“But no one should threaten Venezuela, no-one should mess with Venezuela. We are men of peace, we are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,” he said.“The threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.”A UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated sovereign borders “must be respected” and that London would work internationally “to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld”.Maduro’s government held a controversial referendum on December 3 in which 95% of voters, according to officials in the hard-line leftist government, supported declaring Venezuela the rightful owner of Essequibo.He has since started legal manoeuvres to create a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to issue licenses for extracting crude in the region.Guyana’s Ali has branded the moves a “grave threat to international peace and security.”",
