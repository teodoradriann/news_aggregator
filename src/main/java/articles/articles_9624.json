    "title": "Blinken, Mayorkas migrant mission to Mexico yields no action — amnesty teased for illegals in US",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — The US and Mexico released a joint statement on the ongoing migration crisis Thursday that was heavy on platitudes and support for asylum-seekers, but mentioned no enforcement action to stop a record-breaking wave of illegal immigration — and even teased the prospect of amnesty for those already here unlawfully.\nOfficials claimed a three-hour Mexico City meeting involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was a success — but Thursday’s statement noted no agreed-upon steps to slow or staunch the deluge of migrants seeking asylum.\n“President López Obrador highlighted the commitment of President Biden to pursue regular, orderly, and secure migration. He stressed the need to continue the diplomatic and political engagement with all countries in the region, as well as investing in ambitious development programs throughout the entire hemisphere of the Americas,” the statement said.\n“Both delegations underlined the efforts that the Biden administration is pursuing through development assistance and humanitarian aid, as well as advancing new private investments in the region,” it added.\nThe communique went on to describe existing programs and policy debates without announcing any new initiatives — saying instead that “[t]he two delegations agreed to meet again in Washington in January 2024 to continue to advance our strong partnership on migration management.”\nA three-year surge in illegal crossings, which critics attribute to Biden’s policies, reached an all-time high with nearly 270,000 apprehensions in September alone and daily records topping 10,000 this month— as a single-party caravan of roughly 8,000 migrants treks north through Mexico.\n“The two countries reaffirmed their existing commitments on fostering an orderly, humane, and regular migration,” the joint statement said, vowing to reinforce “our partnership to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality, democratic decline, and violence, and for the two countries’ initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.\n“Ongoing cooperation also includes enhanced efforts to disrupt human smuggling, trafficking, and criminal networks, and continuing the work to promote legal instead of irregular migration pathways. Also, both delegations agreed on the importance of maintaining and facilitating the vital bilateral trade at our shared border.”\nThe statement also noted US and Mexico officials “discussed the benefit of regularizing the situation of long-term undocumented Hispanic migrants and DACA recipients, who are a vital part of the US economy and society” — suggesting the Biden administration might take another run at trying to legislate a pathway to citizenship for both adult illegal immigrants and those brought to the US as children.\nCritics ripped the administration for the lack of progress.\n“At a time when America is experiencing the worst border crisis in our nation’s history, it is unconscionable to hear the Biden Administration’s announcement that Secretaries Mayorkas and Blinken discussed with the President of Mexico amnesty for illegal immigrants,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement.\n“The United States must focus on policies that deter — not attract — people attempting to come here illegally, and the smugglers who profit from the catastrophe at our border,” Johnson added. “This development further demonstrates the Administration has no real intention of solving the humanitarian disaster and immediate national security crisis their policies have created. President Biden needs to stop vacationing and take immediate steps to stop the flow of illegal immigration into our country.”\n“Continue its efforts?” Fox News border reporter Bill Melugin wrote on X.\n“What efforts? Mexico is enabling the chaos at the border by mass issuing humanitarian visas to migrants that allow them to travel through [Mexico] straight to the U.S. border…then they discard the visas on the ground when they cross illegally.”\nBiden administration officials and the Mexican president, however, posted upbeat meeting recaps on social media as Republicans ripped the US emissaries for not driving a tougher bargain.\nLópez Obrador posted on X that “important agreements were reached for the benefit of our people and nations” — without giving any details.\nBlinken wrote, “As we made clear in Mexico City today, we are committed to partnering with Mexico to address our shared challenges, including managing unprecedented irregular migration in the region, reopening key ports of entry, and combating illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs,”\nMayorkas added: “We had a very productive meeting with President [López Obrador] and members of his Cabinet today in Mexico City. The regional challenge of migration requires regional solutions, and we appreciate Mexico’s commitment to continue its efforts alongside us and with others,”\nRichard Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany and acting national intelligence director under former President Donald Trump, questioned the vagueness of the statements.\n“What was accomplished? (Hello? DC reporters?),” Grenell tweeted.\nRep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) suggested that the talks were solely about election-year optics, writing, “Biden finally feels pressure because of the 2024 election — not because of the tens of thousands of lives ruined by fentanyl, trafficking, & migrant crime.”\nFormer Rep. Mayra Flores (R-Texas), the first Mexican-born woman in Congress, wrote on X in response to Mayorkas that the surge in illegal crossings was “orchestrated.”\nFlores, who is running for Congress again in 2024, also tweeted: “There have already been over 700,000 illegal migrant encounters at the southern border since October. December on pace to set highest month ever recorded. What has to happen for the Biden administration to secure our Border?”\nOther Biden administration officials, meanwhile, described the meeting in Mexico City as a success, with a National Security Council spokesperson saying Blinken and Mayorkas had enjoyed a “productive trip.”\n“President López Obrador has taken significant new enforcement actions yet we have a lot more work to do together,” the rep added.\n“President Biden’s Cabinet will meet again with Mexican leaders in DC in January to assess progress and decide what more can be done. We continue to address the root causes and build on legal pathways that incentivize orderly migration and enforcement of our laws.”\nThe NSC also did not specify any new enforcement actions taken by Mexico, but may have been referring to the Obrador government saying last week that it had flown a planeload of migrants from northern Mexico to southern Mexico for repatriation to their home countries. It’s unclear how many people were transported.\nPolling shows that border policy is an election liability for Biden, who is expected to face a rematch against former President Donald Trump, who routinely boasts that he coerced Mexican leaders into beefing up border security.\nA Harvard CAPS-Harris survey released Dec. 18 showed that 38% of registered voters approve of Biden’s handling of immigration — an eight-point drop from 46% in November.\nLópez Obrador previously credited Biden with sparking the border crisis, saying in 2021, “They see [Biden] as the migrant president, and so many feel they’re going to reach the United States.”\nOn his first day as president, Biden halted construction of Trump’s US-Mexico border wall. In June 2021, Biden scrapped Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that required most asylum applicants who reached the southern border to await decisions on their cases south of the Rio Grande.\nNearly 2.5 million people were apprehended after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border in fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, in addition to an estimated 670,000 “gotaways” who eluded authorities.\nThere were nearly 2.4 million arrests in fiscal 2022, following a record-breaking 1.7 million in fiscal 2021.\nMany people who illegally cross the border are allowed into the US to await court rulings on their claims of persecution.\nAfter an initial interval, asylum seekers are entitled to work permits as their claims move through a badly backlogged system of review.\nThe Biden-era illegal immigration figures are much higher than prior annual totals of illegal border crossings.\nFor example, in President Barack Obama’s final full year in office in fiscal 2016, there were 408,870 people arrested for illegally crossing the border.\nObama outraged immigration activists by regularly turning away people who crossed illegally — earning him the nickname “deporter-in-chief.”",

    "text": "Toronto, Dec 29 (IANS) Canadian police said it is investigating an incident in which shots were fired at the residence of a Hindu temple's head’s son in British Columbia in the early hours of Wednesday.Police said no one was injured during the incident at the 14900 block of 80 Avenue in Surrey -- the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.\n\"Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident,\" said Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\nKahlon added that the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes.\nAccording to the Indo-Canadian voice website, as many as 14 shots were fired at the Hindu businessman's house.\nPolice remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage.\nThe Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit is conducting the probe, and has appealed to anyone with more information, including dash cam footage of the incident, to get in touch with them.\nCanada has witnessed a rise in incidents of vandalism and attacks against Hindu temples and installations in the country with pro-Khalistan elements getting active beginning this year.\nThe situation worsened after Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey on June 18 this year.\nThe same Lakshmi Narayan Mandir of Surrey was targeted in August this year after anti-India and pro-Khalistan posters were found pasted on its front and rear walls.\nLast month, Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya shared a purported video of pro-Khalistan supporters in Surrey, claiming they want to create trouble at the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.\nIn September, Shri Mata Bhameshwari Durga temple in Surrey was defaced with anti-India and pro-Khalistan graffiti on its outer walls.\nIncidents of vandalism have also occurred at temples in Brampton and the Greater Toronto area.\n--IANS\nmi/dan\nAdd Chart to Comment",

The former UN Ambassador and South Carolina governor, who has seen her star rise in the first-in-the-nation primary state, was appearing at a town hall event in Berlin, New Hampshire, when a voter asked her to identify the cause of the war. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run,” she responded. “The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do. What do you think the cause of the Civil War was or argument?” The questioner, who could not be easily heard off camera, was apparently unpersuaded by Haley’s response. When she asked him what he believed the cause of the war was, he replied that he wasn’t running for president. “I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,” Haley replied. {snip} When the questioner said it was “astonishing” to hear her respond “without mentioning the word slavery,” Haley replied: “What do you want me to say about slavery?” She then asked for the next question. {snip}",

    "title": "Owner of bricked Pixel 6 feels like his phone was stolen by Google",
    "text": "Last month we told you that the Android 15 update had bricked some users' Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro handsets . Luckily, I was already running the Android 15 beta on my Pixel 6 Pro which might have been the reason that my phone was spared. However, one Pixel 6 owner who was among those not so lucky discovered that his handset had turned into a paperweight after he tried to install the latest major Android build. We're not privy to what this Pixel user's immediate response was, but we can guess that it included some choice words that you wouldn't hear on broadcast television.The Pixel 6 owner ended up sending his phone to Google for an inspection and ultimately to be replaced. He called this process \"the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my life\" anbd the situation has yet to be resolved by Google. Most of you already know that the reputation of Google's customer service is not a good one. This story will only damage its reputation even more. The Pixel 6 owner was supposed to receive a replacement after his phone was bricked by the Android 15 update Pixel 6 on the left, Pixel 6 Pro on the right. | Image credit-PhoneArena Since the last call, our hero was unceremoniously disconnected in the middle of a call about his phone. Even more frightening, another rep told him that the phone's unique IMEI number didn't match any device listed in Google's system. Yikes! He has been without a phone now for more than two weeks since he has not received the replacement he was supposed to receive. The whole situation has left this Pixel 6 owner without a phone, stressed out, and feeling as if Google stole his phone. Here's one solution that will make this customer happy Of course, Google didn't steal his phone. After all, it is a Pixel 6 which means that it has one of the worst modems ever found on a modern-era smartphone. And I can say that from having first-hand experience as a Pixel 6 Pro owner. My Pixel 6 Pro isn't my daily driver which is a job handled reliably by my iPhone 15 Pro Max . But the poor Pixel 6 owner who is the subject of this article has no other phone to use and Google has been stringing him along. Perhaps Google needs to make him a happy customer by sending him a Pixel 9 to replace his missing Pixel 6. Manufacturers have been known to do this.The fabulous HTC One (M8), my favorite phone of all time. | Image credit-HTC Back in 2013, I bought the underrated HTC DROID DNA which was known out of the country as the HTC Butterfly. I don't think I've owned a phone before or since that felt better in my hand. But my unit had a problem that couldn't be fixed and HTC replaced it for me by sending me an HTC One (M8), arguably one of the best phones of all time and my all-time favorite.Google does need to do something for this Pixel 6 owner. He sent his bricked phone back to Google and was told he would receive a replacement. Keep in mind that it wasn't his fault that the software update broke the device. It has now been weeks and he is out his phone and the replacement he was promised. If Google wants the Pixel to become a serious challenger to iPhone and Galaxy smartphones, it needs to improve its customer service operations. Loading Comments...",

    "title": "The Ferrari F80 Combines Le Mans And F1 Tech Into A 1,184 Horsepower Street-Legal Supercar",
    "text": "Only weeks after the reveal of [the McLaren W1](https://www.theautopian.com/why-the-mclaren-w1-is-every-engineers-dream-come-true/), Ferrari is answering back with this, the F80. On its face, it looks sort of like any other modern prancing horse, but under the skin this is a very different animal. The Italian automaker blended F1 and Le Mans tech to create this beast. As a result, its beating heart is a twin-turbocharged V6 hybrid that makes a total output of 1,184 horsepower. The F80 is a successor to the LaFerrari and as such it has big shoes to fill. Ferrari knows that, too. Here’s [what it says](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/f80-ferraris-new-supercar-corporate) of this new supercar (that’s right, Ferrari calls this a supercar, not a hypercar). “The latest addition to this family, the F80, is tasked with embodying the ultimate in engineering for an internal-combustion-engined vehicle and employs all the most advanced technological solutions, including latest-generation hybrid technology for the powertrain, to achieve unparalleled levels of power and torque.” Let’s first focus on the powertrain because it’s a dramatic departure from every other flagship Ferrari ever made. The LaFerrari and F50 leveraged [big V12 engines](https://www.theautopian.com/the-ferrari-purosangue-is-ferraris-first-ever-suv-and-its-got-a-v12-and-suicide-doors-2/). Before that, cars like the F40 and 288 GTO made use of V8s. Now, the “ultimate in engineering” is a twin-turbocharged V6 that shares much of its tech with Ferrari’s Formula 1 car and its Le Mans-winning 499P car. For example, the architecture of the engine itself is “closely derived” from the 499P. That includes the crankcase, the layout and drive chains of the timing system, the oil pump recovery circuit, the injectors, GDI pumps, and bearings. The front motor, a component called the MGU-K unit, is the first of its kind as it was developed, tested, and manufactured by Ferrari itself. Ferrari incorporated more technology to really push the limit of what the engine can manage as well. The knock control now allows for operation closer to the knock limit thanks to variable-phase valve timing. As a result, combustion pressures can be 20 percent higher than those found in the 296 GTB. The eTurbo system is tuned to react differently based on the load and the specific gear so as to reduce lag and make the engine feel naturally aspirated. All of the tech incorporated enables this engine to rev to a staggering 9,200 RPM. Ferrari says it’ll go from 0-200 km/h (124 mph) in 5.7 seconds. That’s 0.1 seconds faster than the McLaren W1. The car also features three electric motors including one in the rear incorporated into the engine and two more at the front. The trio makes a combined 296 horsepower to stack on top of the 900ish ponies created by the internal combustion engine alone. Drivers will have the option of using three different drive modes including Hybrid, Performance, and Qualify. Unsurprisingly, each has its own unique application on the road or track. Hybrid is basically normal mode, Performance mode is basically like a track mode with consistent boost and the goal of maintaining a 70-percent state of battery charge, and Qualify adds maximum boost without concern for how long the battery lasts. According to Ferrari, there is also a new “Boost Optimisation” setting that can learn a specific track and then use that data to deliver “an extra power boost in sections of the track where it is most needed.” Ferrari also built a new set of brakes to handle all of that power. Crafted in collaboration with Brembo, the new discs in the F80 use longer carbon fibers to make the disc not just stronger but also better at dissipating heat. According to the automaker, these brakes are twice as strong and three times as good at conducting heat. This car is also unique in terms of its cabin. Ferrari refers to this car as a 1+ layout with basically everything inside focused entirely on the driver. The center control stack wraps around the driver, the dash design also focuses on the driver, and even the driver’s seat is uniquely upholstered for the occasion that is this car. The steering wheel is new for the F80. It gets a new shape with what Ferrari claims are improved ergonomics. Notably, Ferrari also brought back physical buttons for the wheel rather than touch-sensitive ones. They rightly point out that one can use them without having to look at the switchgear. Underneath the cabin and bodywork, one will find a unique suspension. The upper wishbones are [3D-printed metal](https://www.theautopian.com/some-geniuses-are-3d-printing-parts-for-their-mazda-miata-builds/) that appears more organic than industrial. The car benefits from inboard dampers and in turn, doesn’t need an anti-roll bar to accomplish its goals. Ferrari says it’ll build just 799 examples of this new halo flagship supercar. Ferrari has sold every one of them already says [Autocar](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ferrari-f80-succeeds-laferrari-1184bhp-f1-v6-powertrain). Buyers willing to pony up the $3.2 million dollar price for this car also benefit from a seven-year maintenance program that’ll keep the F80 in peak condition. Now, all we need is a new Porsche flagship supercar so that we can have a new holy trinity.",
