    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — The typical pathway for most teenagers is to graduate high school before moving onto college.\nWhat You Need To Know Kaylee Burgess Lebron is a 15-year-old student\nShe graduated college before high school\nShe wants to pursue a career in cosmetology following her mother But in recent years, there have been more and more cases of students earning a college degree while they’re still in high school.\nAccording to the Ohio Department of Higher Education, more than 4,000 high schoolers did just that between 2016 and 2023.\nKaylee Burgess Lebron is a 15-year-old college graduate.\n“I’m really excited to be graduating so young,” said Kaylee Burgess Lebron, a Columbus State Community College Graduate.\nAt just 12 years old she enrolled as a college freshman at Columbus State Community College.\nThree years later, during her Sophomore of High School, she’s earned an associates degree.\n“It was really hard to do during high school because I would do my classes during school, and then I would get home and have a ton of homework to do from both schools,” Burgess Lebron said.\nIn the grand scheme of things, there aren’t many people who accomplish what Kaylee has done, but over the last few years, it’s become more and more common.\nAccording to the most recent data from the Ohio Department of Higher Education, about 700 high schoolers in the state have earned a college degree during each of the last three school years.\nThat number is nearly triple what it was back in 2016, and even includes three people who earned Bachelor’s degrees while still in high school.\nThe state’s College Credit Plus program gives students the opportunity to earn college credit while they’re still in high school.\nAccording to the chancellor of the department, it can help students save more than $30,000, and gives them opportunities to explore careers they might otherwise may never have.\n“When I was little, I always loved doing my makeup,” Burgess Lebron said.\nFor Kaylee that is a career in Cosmetology, taking after her mom.\n“I always loved having her do my hair, and so I used to go to work with her all the time when I was little so I guess I sort of looked up to her in a way,” Burgess Lebron said.\nBurgess Lebron is in a cosmetology program at C-TEC in Newark.\nAnd her mother, Christina, said she’s extremely proud of her daughter.\n“Kaylee’s very determined,\" Christina Lebron said. \"Very strict, I think she was the only 10-yea-old I knew that had a vision board, and she knew exactly what she wanted to do.\"\n“My friends think it’s crazy, they’re proud of me, they think it’s a great goal to have, and so does my family, they’re really proud of me,” Burgess Lebron said.",

    "text": "People Dad and Daughter Spent 6 Hours Stuck in Traffic Due to Icy Houston Weather: 'Lots of Bonding Time' Read full article Brian Brant 21 pm · 3-min read\n\"Four hours sitting in one spot not moving was scary for me,\" one driver said\nSmiley N. Pool/Houston Chronicle via Getty\nMotorist exit their cars as traffic comes to a stop on westbound 1-10 at I-45 due to icy conditions on Friday, Feb. 4, 2011, in Houston. A father and daughter were among the thousands of drivers who got stuck on a Texas tollway for hours amid icy conditions on Monday.\nBrent Hess was headed to the George Bush Intercontinental Airport to drop his daughter Courtney off for her 12:30 p.m. flight to Denver, but the duo ended up getting stuck in a six-hour traffic jam on the Hardy Tollway, NBC affiliate KPRC-TV reported.\n\"As soon as we got off from the Grand Parkway, it was literally five minutes [away], and we were dead stopped,” he said.\nBrent and Courtney weren't alone.\nRelated: Girl, 9, Among 3 Generations of a Family Killed in Texas Car Crash Just Days After Christmas\nAnother man told CBS affiliate KHOU that his 22-mile commute home from work took over six hours. He watched on as drivers slipped \"out of control\" on the ice. According to the station, the holdup was caused by an accident.\nThe man, identified by the outlet as Ariel M., went on to share that several drivers ran out of gas and were forced to shut off their cars to save fuel. \"Four hours sitting in one spot not moving was scary for me,\" he asaid.\nBrent said he didn't know what caused the standstill until his wife called the Harris County Toll Road Authority. That's when they learned there was still ice present after road crews treated the roadway twice to make it navigable.\nRelated: At Least 5 Dead as Cold Weather Rages Through Midwest\nThe HCTRA said in a Monday evening post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that crews had finally \"finished treating the northbound lanes of the Hardy Toll Road.\"\n\"However, icy conditions remain on the southbound lanes and crews are currently treating those lanes,\" they added. \"Even with a second treatment, icy conditions could remain due to the extreme cold and without a warming trend to assist the de-icing mixture.\"\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n“I used to work up I-70 in Colorado in the mountain area, and I still could get home. It was not this bad,” Courtney told KPRC-TV. “They just didn’t prepare. They don’t know. Houston, just, they have to learn to kind of de-ice the roads ahead of time.”\nStory continues The Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said in a statement on Tuesday that multiple agencies, including the Texas Department of Transportation and the Harris County Toll Road Authority, \"pre-treated freeways and roadways across the county, including the Hardy Toll Road.\"\nRelated: Grandmother and Baby Rescued from Partially Submerged Car After Crashing into Watery Ditch\n\"Even as conditions worsened, they responded to reports of icy conditions throughout the day, laying sand or aggregate to help create traction,\" the department added. \"Some freeway overpasses and bridges were ultimately closed in the interest of public safety.\"\nThe HCOHSEM shared that most residents \"do not have experience driving in wintery conditions and the result is always a large number of motor vehicle accidents and long traffic delays.\" Making matters worse, the office noted that \"first responders and road crews are often stuck in the same traffic as other motorists and unable to provide timely assistance.\"\n\"We are getting back to normal today as sunshine is eliminating the remaining ice and moisture on the roads,\" the agency continued. PEOPLE has reached out to the Harris County Toll Road Authority for comment.\nCourtney ultimately missed her flight, according to KPRC-TV. Still, there was one silver lining, according to the dad: they got \"lots of bonding time.\"\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\nRead the original article on People ",

    "text": "The Evolving Landscape of Protest in America: From Local Raids to National Flashpoints Over $20 billion – that’s the estimated economic cost of civil unrest in the U.S. annually, a figure poised to climb as political polarization intensifies and triggers increasingly frequent demonstrations. The recent wave of protests sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles, and the subsequent deployment of National Guard troops in multiple states, isn’t simply a reaction to specific policies; it’s a symptom of a deeper, evolving dynamic in American civic engagement, one that demands a closer look at its potential trajectory.\nFrom Los Angeles to a Nationwide Movement The initial unrest centered on the Los Angeles raids, drawing condemnation from Mayor Karen Bass who argued the actions were designed to instill fear rather than ensure safety. While many demonstrations remained peaceful, the clashes with law enforcement and instances of vandalism highlighted a growing frustration and, for some, a willingness to escalate tactics. The spread of protests to cities like New York, Seattle, Chicago, and San Francisco demonstrates the rapid mobilization capabilities of activist networks in the digital age. This isn’t a geographically isolated phenomenon; it’s a networked response.\nThe planned “No Kings Day” protests on Saturday, organized by progressive groups, represent a deliberate attempt to capitalize on this momentum and frame the demonstrations as resistance to the current administration’s policies. The juxtaposition of this event with President Trump’s planned military parade – celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and his 79th birthday – is a calculated move designed to amplify the contrast between perceived authoritarianism and grassroots dissent.\nThe Militarization of Domestic Response A particularly concerning trend is the increasing reliance on military and National Guard deployments to manage civilian protests. Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s order to mobilize troops in San Antonio and Austin, while framed as a measure to maintain order, raises questions about the appropriate role of the military in domestic affairs. This echoes historical patterns where militarized responses to civil unrest can escalate tensions and erode public trust. The presence of armored vehicles and heavily armed personnel can be perceived as an act of intimidation, potentially fueling further unrest rather than deterring it.\nThis trend isn’t limited to conservative states. The deployment of National Guard in Los Angeles, while requested by local authorities, underscores a broader national pattern. The line between maintaining public safety and suppressing dissent is becoming increasingly blurred, and the potential for missteps – or intentional overreach – is significant. For further analysis on the implications of militarizing domestic law enforcement, see the Brennan Center for Justice’s report on police militarization .\nThe Role of Social Media and Decentralized Organizing Social media platforms continue to be instrumental in organizing and amplifying protests. The speed with which information – and misinformation – can spread online makes it challenging to control the narrative and counter extremist voices. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of many protest movements makes it difficult for authorities to identify and engage with key organizers. This creates a dynamic where spontaneous actions and unpredictable escalations are more likely.\nThe use of encrypted messaging apps, like Signal and Telegram, further complicates matters, providing protesters with secure channels for communication that are difficult for law enforcement to monitor. While these tools are essential for protecting activists from surveillance, they also create opportunities for malicious actors to exploit the situation and incite violence.\nLooking Ahead: The Potential for Sustained Instability The current wave of protests is unlikely to dissipate quickly. Several factors suggest that we are entering a period of sustained civic unrest. The deep political divisions within the country, coupled with economic anxieties and social inequalities, create a fertile ground for discontent. The upcoming presidential election is likely to further exacerbate these tensions, regardless of the outcome.\nMoreover, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events – exacerbated by climate change – is likely to displace communities and create new sources of social unrest. As resources become scarcer and competition intensifies, the potential for conflict will only grow. Understanding these interconnected factors is crucial for anticipating and mitigating future crises.\nThe challenge for policymakers and community leaders is to find ways to address the root causes of unrest while protecting the right to peaceful protest. This requires a commitment to dialogue, transparency, and accountability. Ignoring the underlying grievances that fuel these movements will only lead to further polarization and instability.

    "text": "Hyderabad: The absence of Sthapathis during the ‘Maha Kumbhabhisheka Samprokshna’ (temple consecration) at the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple in Yadagirigutta on Sunday has not gone down well with many.\nThe temple management had made elaborate arrangements for the ceremony, but failed to extend a formal invitation to the Sthapathis. More so, a few present at the temple complained that they were denied permission to participate in the special pujas at the Vimana Gopuram and felt humiliated.\nAlso Read Development of Telangana’s Yadadri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple loses focus Sthapathis are traditional temple architects, who play an important role in selecting the rocks used to construct the temple, finalising the designs and other aspects.\nRight from Sthapathi Sundararajan, Padma Shri Anandachari Velu, architect Anand Sai and a few others, the Sthapathis had worked for the Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority (YTDA). However, none of them were present at the Maha Kumbhabhisheka Samprokshna. “I did not get any invitation from the temple management. I do not want to comment,” said a Sthapathi.\nThe presence of the Sthapathis during the Maha Samprokshana ceremony is considered important in many traditional temple practices. Their presence is generally considered as both an architectural and spiritual necessity.\nFurthermore, deputy Sthapathi J Mothilal was present at the temple. However, he was not permitted to participate in the ceremony.\n“Executive officer Bhaskar Rao said I was not invited to the ceremony and asked me not to participate,” Mothilal said. This happened in front of all other officers and media persons in the temple, he said.\nMothilal said he was involved in preparing the estimates for the Vimana Gopuram gold and copper plating and signing of the agreement with the agency.\n“Along with Sundararajan, I also helped the technical committee in executing the gold plating works,” Mothilal said.",
