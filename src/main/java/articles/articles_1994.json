    "title": "India experiences hottest October in 123 years, IMD expects heat to linger in November",
    "text": "India experienced its hottest October since 1901, with the average temperature hitting 26.92 degrees Celsius \\u2014 that\\u2019s 1.23 degrees above the normal October average, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). And it looks like November might not bring much relief either. IMD Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra explained that the warmer weather was largely due to the absence of cooling western disturbances and the unusual presence of easterly winds, caused by active low-pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal. Also Read:Weather Update: IMD issues orange alert for heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, three other states; Delhi-NCR witnesses smog blanket \"In north-western India, north-westerly winds are needed for lower temperatures. The monsoonal flow was also there that does not allow fall in temperature,\" Mohapatra said. The minimum temperatures also rose above normal, with the average reading reaching 21.85 degrees Celsius instead of the usual 20.01 degrees. In the coming two weeks, northwestern plains can expect to stay about 2-5 degrees warmer than average, but a gradual cooling trend should begin soon afterward. Also Read:Diwali Weather Update: Warm October surrounds Diwali in Delhi, THESE states could witness rainfall today Although November isn\\u2019t technically considered a winter month, Mohapatra said hints of cooler weather usually start in December, with January and February bringing the coldest days of winter. Southern region to receive heavy rains In the southern regions, the northeast monsoon is expected to bring heavy rains this November, especially in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Kerala, and Karnataka. Northwestern India, however, could see less-than-average rainfall. The delay in the arrival of cold weather might be due to neutral El Nino conditions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with predictions showing that La Nina could gradually take over by December. La Nina often leads to stronger cold winds from the Hindu Kush, which can make Indian winters chillier. Global forecasting on El Nino hasn\\u2019t been straightforward this year, but IMD remains optimistic about a shift toward cooler temperatures by December as La Nina strengthens.",

    "title": "B.C. civil lawsuit against Sex Pistols guitarist alleges 1980 sexual assault",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "CARLYLE - Michelle Cooper of Carlyle has always been a big supporter of her community. Recently she was awarded the Bowl of Hygeia, a prestigious award and the highest honour in the pharmacy profession. The Pharmacy Association of Saskatchewan held its conference Sept. 14-15 in Regina, and Cooper was presented with the honour. Cooper's connection to Carlyle runs deep. She and her husband Brad made their home in Carlyle where she was raised. Together they are raising two children, Jessica and Ryan, who attend school in Carlyle. The town has always been a strong anchor for Cooper, and she has continuously given back to the community that has shaped her for many years. Being a founding partner of Legacy Pharmacies, which operates seven pharmacies across Saskatchewan under the Pharmasave and Pharmachoice banners, she still finds time to be part of the community through volunteer work. Cooper is actively involved in several organizations, including the Carlyle Lions Club, the school community council, Carlyle Fun Dayz committee and the White Bear Cottagers Association. She has volunteered hundreds of hours to help keep organizations going, while being busy with her career. To be nominated for this award, one has to be a licensed pharmacist within the jurisdiction in which the award is presented, not have received this award before, and have an outstanding community service record apart from being a pharmacist. The Bowl of Hygeia was first presented in 1958 in the U.S. and came to Canada in 1961. It is now recognized in the 10 provinces, as each province holds its own awards. Nominations are usually done in secrecy. The word Hygeia is rooted from Greek mythology. It is said that Hygeia was the daughter of the god of health, and she tended to the temples and people of her time. Her cup has come to represent medicine and her snake to represent healing. This award is one of the longest-standing, continuously-presented pharmacy honours in Canada.",

De acuerdo con información del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN), dicho frente se desplazará al sureste de Estados Unidos, provocando afectaciones en México. Además, una línea seca en interacción con el flujo de corriente de vientos máximos y la advección de aire cálido y húmedo del Golfo de México provocarán rachas de viento y lluvias en distintas partes de la región. Otro factor que propiciará las lluvias, es el canal de baja presión que se extenderá sobre el oriente y sureste mexicano, e interaccionará con la entrada de humedad del golfo de México y el mar Caribe. Te podría interesar ¿En qué estados habrá lluvias durante el Día de Muertos? Los estados que sufrirán los aguaceros durante la celebración del Día de Muertos en México, según el pronóstico del SMN son los siguientes: Viernes 1 de noviembre - Chiapas - Oaxaca - Veracruz - Tabasco - Coahuila - Nuevo León - Tamaulipas - Guerrero - Puebla - Campeche Sábado 2 de noviembre - Guerrero - Oaxaca - Chiapas - Quintana Roo. - Michoacán - Veracruz - Tabasco - Yucatán Además de las lluvias que irán de fuertes a muy fuertes en los estados mencionados, puede haber intervalos de chubascos en otras regiones como la Ciudad de México, el Estado de México, Morelos, Hidalgo y Querétaro. Por otra parte, el SMN reportó que se mantendrá un ambiente vespertino caluroso a muy caluroso en las costas del Pacífico central y sur mexicano, por lo que algunos estados del norte tienen escasa probabilidad de 'mojarse'. Las temperaturas mínimas del fin de semana se encontrarán en las zonas montañosas de Baja California, Chihuahua, Durango, Sonora y Zacatecas. Es importante mantenerse alerta de las recomendaciones de las autoridades para que el clima no 'arruine' los planes durante los festejos del Día de Muertos.",
