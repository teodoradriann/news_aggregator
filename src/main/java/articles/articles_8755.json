    "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Snap (SNAP) is a Great Choice - December 29, 2023 - Zacks.com",
    "text": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores , helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Snap ( SNAP Quick Quote SNAP - Free Report ) , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Snap currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SNAP that show why this company behind Snapchat shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor SNAP, shares are up 0.77% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is up 0.83% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 23.28% compares favorably with the industry's 6.74% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Snap have risen 95.08%, and are up 93.53% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.75% and 28.39%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to SNAP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SNAP is currently averaging 25,882,772 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SNAP.\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SNAP's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.04 to $0.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SNAP is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Snap on your short list.",

    "text": "Pope Francis is a left-wing Jesuit and doesn’t represent Catholicism as I’ve known it. He is an outlier, as are most Jesuits. Some are perfectly fine people, and some are definitely not. The order is generally outside the mainstream of Catholicism.\nThe same goes for Catholic Charities and its offshoots.\nI had one priest tell me if Jose Bergoglio, Pope Francis, is chosen by The College of Cardinals, he would be the worst choice, and he is. Pope Francis is in the hospital right now, and we wish him well, but it would be nice if he retired.\nI remember talking to one Jesuit about a term paper I wrote, and he told me abortion was fine as long as you feel good about it. He told me people aren’t really sinners since they generally don’t mean it, and so on. Bigeye roll here.\nIf you want to commit a sin, you go to the Jesuits to get permission.\nRead the crazed email Libs of TikTok received:\nOur traditional Catholic K-12 makes this hole look like Karl Marx Central School. I thank God daily we never have to deal with these weirdos.\nJesuits are far outliers on the leftist margin of Catholicism. Their laity teachers are even worse. My family ignores them all entirely. https://t.co/uddZJ99BTF\n— Michael R. Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) February 15, 2025",

    "text": "À la ferme pédagogique du Moulin de bois à Farbus, on trouve même… des alpagas ! Pouvez-vous nous présenter les alpagas ? « Alors, je vous présente Paquito et Phébus. Ils ont le même âge : 2 ans. Ils viennent tous les deux de l’élevage de la cour Farroux, dans l’Aisne. Nous sommes allés les chercher quand ils avaient à peu près 8, 9 mois, quand ils étaient sevrés. Mais dans leur milieu naturel, ce sont des animaux qui vivent au Pérou, en Amérique du Sud. » De quoi se nourrissent-ils ? « Ce sont des animaux végétariens. Ils se nourrissent essentiellement d’herbe, de feuillage, de foin… Il ne leur faut pas grand-chose d’autre. L’alpaga est un ruminant. Il a des dents en bas, mais pas en haut. Un peu comme les chèvres. » Est-ce qu’ils aiment vivre seuls ? « Alors, non. Ce sont des animaux grégaires. Cela veut dire qu’ils aiment vivre en groupe. Donc quand on prend un alpaga, on sait qu’on ne va pas en prendre un, mais forcément deux. Sinon, il va s’ennuyer et il ne sera pas en bonne santé. » Sont-ils fragiles ? « Pas vraiment. Puisque ce sont des animaux qui vivent au Pérou, en altitude. Donc ils sont assez résistants. Le problème, c’est que ce sont des ruminants. Et un blocage de la rumination, ça peut être fatal. Et puis, le souci qu’on rencontre aussi, c’est que les vétérinaires ne sont pas forcément formés à la santé des alpagas. Chez l’alpaga, l’espérance de vie est d’environ une vingtaine d’années. » Quel est le rôle des alpagas à la ferme ? « Nous avons choisi de prendre des alpagas pour la médiation animale, parce que ce sont des animaux relativement doux. Évidemment, ils ont été aussi bien éduqués dans l’élevage, avant d’arriver ici. Ils ont été socialisés et habitués à l’humain. Mais il faut savoir quand même que ce sont des animaux très craintifs. Quand on les approche, il faut toujours beaucoup de précautions. » [Violences chez les jeunes : sanctions sur le diplôme, plus d’heures au collège, internat, ce qu’a annoncé Gabriel Attal](/1453345/article/2024-04-18/violences-chez-les-jeunes-sanctions-sur-le-diplome-plus-d-heures-au-college) [Au collège Jean-Jacques-Rousseau d’Avion, le théâtre utilisé pour réguler les émotions des élèves](/1453375/article/2024-04-18/au-college-jean-jacques-rousseau-d-avion-le-theatre-utilise-pour-reguler-les) [Le 24 avril, des aménagements pour plus de sécurité devant le lycée public d’Avesnes](/1452908/article/2024-04-17/le-24-avril-des-amenagements-pour-plus-de-securite-devant-le-lycee-public-d) Poursuivez votre lecture sur ce(s) sujet(s) : [Ta Voix Jeunes reporters](/tags/ta-voix-jeunes-reporters) [Ta Voix Loisirs](/tags/ta-voix-loisirs)",

    "title": "Pakistan Iran agree to 'de-escalate the situation' and strengthen coordination on counter-terrorism - The Week",
    "text": "Islamabad, Jan 19 (PTI) Pakistan and Iran on Friday agreed to \"de-escalate the situation\" and strengthen coordination on counter-terrorism as the two sides began to pick threads of tattered ties following their tit-for-tat military strikes in each other's territory.\nForeign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani spoke with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on the telephone and expressed his country's desire to “work with Iran based on the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement.\n\"The Foreign Minister stressed that respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty must underpin this cooperation,\" it said.\nThey \"agreed that working-level cooperation and close coordination on counter-terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,” the FO said, underscoring the close \"brotherly relations\" between the two neighbours.\nThe return of the Ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed.\nIn a separate statement earlier, the FO said Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan’s readiness to work with Iran on \"all issues and underscored the need for closer cooperation on security issues\".\nThe positive development came after Pakistan conducted \"precision military strikes\" against what it called \"terrorist hideouts\" in Iran's Siestan-Balochistan province that killed 9 people on Thursday. The attack was seen as retaliation to Iranian missile and drone attacks on Tuesday, which targeted two bases of the Sunni Baloch militant group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan's unruly Balochistan province.\nAccording to IRNA, Iran’s official news agency, Amir Abdollahian urged Pakistan to assist in “foiling plots and destroying terrorist hideouts in its territories.”\nThe top Iranian diplomat also called for the pursuit of security and military cooperation seriously, noting that Iranian forces will not allow terrorist groups to carry out sabotage in the country.\nPointing to Iran’s recent attack on a hideout of the so-called Jaish al-Adl terrorist group inside Pakistani soil, he argued that intelligence documents showed that over 50 terrorists were getting ready to conduct terrorist attacks on Iran.\nHe further said that under the current circumstances in Palestine, where the Israeli regime is committing crimes against the oppressed nation, influential countries of the Islamic world such as Iran and Pakistan are expected to maintain unity.\nPakistani foreign minister, for his part, emphasized that both nations have a common attitude in the fight against terrorism, adding that Islamabad underlines the need for maintaining constructive and brotherly ties with Tehran.\nIn the phone conversation, the Pakistani top diplomat officially invited his Iranian counterpart to visit Islamabad, the IRNA said.\nEarlier, Jilani and his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan discussed the “ongoing developments between Pakistan and Iran”, the Foreign Office said.\nHe told Fidan that the military strikes were aimed at terrorist camps inside Iran and added that Pakistan has no interest or desire for escalation.\nAlso, officials of the foreign ministries from Iran and Pakistan exchanged goodwill messages, belying fears of escalation and showing that the tiff between the two neighbours was cooling off sooner than it erupted two days ago.\nForeign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch shared an exchange of messages between Additional Foreign Secretary Rahim Hayat Qureshi and his Iranian counterpart Seyed Rasoul Mousavi on her X handle, saying: “Some positive exchanges.”\nIn a post on X today, the Foreign Office additional secretary responded to his Iranian counterpart’s letter saying he reciprocated the sentiments of “dear brother Seyed Rasoul Mousavi.”\nHe said Pakistan and Iran have fraternal relations and the countries need to move forward to resolve all issues through positive dialogue.\nHe said that it is important to restore trust and confidence that has always defined bilateral relations between the two countries. “Our common challenges including terrorism require coordinated action,” he added.\nMousavi said he believed that Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the endpoint of the prevailing tensions between the two countries. “Leaders and high officials of both countries know that only terrorists and enemies of both countries benefit from the existing tension between the two neighbouring countries,” he wrote on X in Persian.",
