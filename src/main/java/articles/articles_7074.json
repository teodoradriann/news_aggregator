    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Evan Ferguson on dry loan smart? Clearlake bitten off more than they can chew, time to hand over to Boehly? Big respect to Chilwell after being treated badly, Silva, Eghbali, & being Chelsea, More...\nThe Chelsea FC Newsletter: Friday 31st January 2025\nMorning all!\nFriday again already, that week flew by! They told us it was going to be ‘very busy’ for Chelsea in the market, but the fact remains we have not yet done a single permanent transfer deal outgoing or incoming. Still time left I guess…\nAnyways, round up all your very latest transfer news from across the last 24 hours in the same place in here. This will cover all the very latest transfer stories involving Chelsea. This has all the latest on Mathys Tel and anything else going on (not much in fact). I still feel a shock coming from nowhere, we simply have to get a striker in. Maybe a Benjamin Sesko comes from nowhere, or we drop the bag for Liam Delap. I’d be happy with either.\nWe also had our latest Podcast out last night to speak about any late transfer moves we can expect to see. You can listen to that here.\nEvan Ferguson on a loan deal might be one last minute option that Chelsea could turn to. Is that something you would go for? I would take it on a dry loan with an option, and I explain why here. It’s still an option for Chelsea, let’s see if they try it.\nThe Score jumped back on yesterday and he is once again spitting facts in his latest article here. Chelsea doesn’t feel like Chelsea these days, and he’s explained it so well in his latest titled ‘Thiago Silva, Behdad Eghbali, & being Chelsea.’\nHave Clearlake bitten off more than they can chew? One community member on here believes they have and has a feeling they might sell up to Todd Boehly. But we believe that might be more hopeful than anything else right now. The quotes in this here are an absolute MUST READ, this is all completely spot on.\nFinally, it’s been reported that Ben Chilwell might have to stay at Chelsea and rot some more. I want to say massive respect to Chilly for being so professional through all of this, even though he’s been yet another player treated like crap by this lot. I do hope he still finds a move, but it’s looking like a hard task now. My words on Chilly and how he has been treated in here.\nRight, I’ll jump on the Substack App this weekend if I get any info given to me or if any big stories go out. If not, I’ll be back on the site on Sunday so see you all then.\nHave a great weekend!\nSimon Phillips",

    "text": "His mother envisaged years of bliss married to her war-hero husband, Group Captain Peter Townsend, only for the dream to fall foul of Townsend's duties as equerry to George VI – and the proximity of the Monarch's vivacious younger daughter, Princess Margaret . Now Piers de Laszlo – Rosemary Townsend's only son by her second marriage – is coming to terms with a heartbreaking loss of his own following a debilitating battle with cancer . To his intense regret, it's forced him to abandon his hopes of establishing a haven for fellow artists, and for writers, in a Portuguese fishing town, Olhao, where, for several years, he's been buying up enchanting old houses which would otherwise have been knocked down or subjected to formulaic modernisation. 'I hoped to have an art school,' Piers, 65, tells me. He's the grandson of society portraitist, Philip de Laszlo, who painted almost all the crowned heads of Europe as well as Edward VII and a very young Princess Elizabeth. 'The idea was to call it The Crumbling Foundation,' adds de Laszlo, who rescued 14 houses in various states of ruination and inspired others – including the Earl of St Germans's widow, Jacquetta – to emulate him. Piers de Laszlo's battle with cancer has forced him to abandon his hopes of establishing a haven for fellow artists, and for writers, in a Portuguese fishing town, Olhao (pictured) For several years, he's been buying up enchanting old houses in Olhao (pictured) which would otherwise have been knocked down or subjected to formulaic modernisation He envisaged the emergence of an artistic community. Pictured are people relaxing in terraces in Olhao, Algarve, Portugal His hope was to make the houses habitable but otherwise leave them unchanged. 'Each is unique. The insides are very much part of why they're so marvellous. That's where the vast majority of the architecture and design and the domestic story has gone,' explains de Laszlo, adding that developers invariably preserve facades 'but knock down everything inside' and create 'sterile, open plan luxury'. He envisaged the emergence of an artistic community – with perhaps some of the uninhibited spirit that he encountered in the 1970s, when, soon after leaving Harrow, he went to Surrendell Farm in Wiltshire, whose owner, the Earl of Bessborough's sister, Sarah Ponsonby, created a commune which attracted Dame Helen Mirren and her then boyfriend, Prince George Galitzine, as well as Roddy Llewellyn, who was periodically visited by his then lover, Princess Margaret. With his dream over, de Laszlo hopes to find new owners for the houses 'who really like them'. If they do, he'll treat them to a bonus, he tells me: 'I'll paint their portrait when they move in.' If things were hotting up between Harry Styles and actress Taylor Russell, he has certainly found a way to make them cool off. The pop superstar, 29, plunged into the chilly waters of Hampstead Heath ponds in North London on Boxing Day with the Canadian, also 29. Both shunned wetsuits, with the As It Was singer showing off his strapping physique in a pair of swimming trunks, while Russell wore a black unitard. But they did both sport woolly hats plus swimming socks and gloves for their dip in the water, which was a rather bracing 8c. Brrr... Harry Styles showed off his ripped physique as he enjoyed a chilly dip in the Hampstead Heath swimming ponds with his girlfriend Taylor Russell, in a snap shared by a fan on Instagram Harry and Taylor (pictured earlier this month) were first romantically linked after they were spotted enjoying an art gallery date in London in June Having once declared that it is 'totally OK for a man to wear eyeliner at dinner', baronet's heir Robert Sheffield betrays no sign of losing his sense of adventure. 'Maybe my favourite day ooot hunting ever on Boxing Day,' he captions this snap of him with half-sister Emily Sheffield, former deputy editor of Vogue. 'We galloped, jumped and laughed our way out of a hangover,' adds Robert, 39. Perhaps he'll lure his half-sister, Samantha, and her husband, Lord (David) Cameron, back into the saddle? The Foreign Secretary has been rather shy of field sports in recent years, though in 2019 he was said to have shot a stag — and promptly named it 'Boris'. Robert Sheffield shared a snap of him with half-sister Emily Sheffield, former deputy editor of Vogue, saying: 'Maybe my favourite day ooot hunting ever on Boxing Day. We galloped, jumped and laughed our way out of a hangover' Samantha Cameron, David Cameron and Emily Sheffield at the Victoria & Albert Museum's Summer Party in June 2018 First it was bats, now a bent roof threatens to scupper Game Of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie 's plans to convert a barn at their Suffolk farmhouse. The couple want to build a huge rooflight along the top of the bowed outbuilding at their 15th-century retreat. But conservationists fear it will harm the quirky character of the Grade II listed Tudor home. Now the council has called for new plans. It said: 'The existing roof structure of the barn is very uneven and I am concerned about the implementation of this fenestration — would it be necessary to flatten this for installation, removing its character?' Game of Thrones star Kit Harington and wife Rose Leslie pictured in London in June 2019 Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie's £1.75m country property in Suffolk Clare Balding loved her genteel corner of West London so much that she and fellow broadcaster Alice Arnold were married at the local stately home, Chiswick House. But now they're quitting the capital for the countryside, because they are so worried about their pets being stolen or killed on the busy roads. 'We've bought a new house and we are going to knock it down and build, so that we have a protected space around it where the doors can be open,' says Balding, who longs to replace her late Tibetan terrier Archie. 'Consequently, either puppy or new young dog or whatever can get out all the time and the cats won't get either run over or kidnapped. We are changing our whole life to suit the dog that will come in.' Clare Balding loved her genteel corner of West London so much that she and fellow broadcaster Alice Arnold were married at the local stately home, Chiswick House. The couple are pictured outside Chiswick House at their wedding reception in September 2006 Damien Hirst's heavily pregnant girlfriend, Sophie Cannell, has taken to feeding their pet chihuahua from her navel (pictured) Strange goings-on in the household of Damien Hirst, whose heavily pregnant girlfriend, Sophie Cannell, has taken to feeding their pet chihuahua from her navel. Does the pampered pooch not know that if it doesn't behave, it could end up like one of Hirst's art works, such as the shark pickled in formaldehyde or the chopped-up cow? Former ballerina Cannell, 29, is expecting her first child with Hirst, who is 29 years her senior. She lives with the former enfant terrible of the art world at his £36million, 14-bedroom home in Regent's Park, London .",
