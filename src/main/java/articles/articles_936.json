(Image: Twitter) New Delhi : In a bid to reach out directly to the farmers and discuss their issue, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that he will hold regular meetings with them in his office in the first half of every Tuesday.\n“I will personally, on a regular basis, establish a seedha samvad (direct dialouge) with our farmers and their organisations to address their pressing concerns,” Mr Chouhan said, adding that the weekly meetings with the farmers will be held with prior intimation.\nGiving out the details of important decisions and achievements of the ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare in the first 100 days during the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Chouhan at a press conference in the national capital said that the government has a six-point strategy for the welfare of farmers and development of agriculture.\n“Farmers are the soul and life of agriculture. The Prime Minister said from the rampart of the Red Fort that he will work three times more than before. All the officers of the agriculture department, including me, have taken a pledge that why should the Prime Minister work alone, we will all work together. We have made this effort in the first hundred days. We have a six-point strategy for the welfare of farmers and development of agriculture.”\nThe Union agriculture minister announced that a new television and radio programme named \"Krishi Chaupal\" will launch next month with an aim to bridge the gap between farmers and the latest agricultural research and technology, ensuring that vital information reaches those who need it most.\nHe noted the government's strategy to boost both farm production and farmers' income by ensuring assured procurement at minimum support prices (MSP).\nMr Chouhan said: “Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy and is also the base of our life and it is the biggest responsibility of the government to provide food security to 140 crore countrymen.”\nThe Union minister mentioned that among the decisions taken recently, the major decision was that to increase the production of crops, the Prime Minister had dedicated new seeds of 109 varieties of 65 crops to the farmers, which are climate friendly, pest resistant and high yielding.\n“One way of reducing the cost of production, we are committed to ensuring that farmers get cheap fertilisers on time. A bag of urea costs `2,366. We make it available to farmers for `266. A bag of DAP costs `2,433 which we make available to farmers for `1,350,” he said.\nMr Chouhan noted that another special work has been done in 100 days and that the launch of the Digital Agriculture Mission has been approved. He said that the National Pest Surveillance System is important for farmers and they have started using it.\nThe Union minister said that modern kisan chaupal is going to be started in October, in which scientists will provide direct information to the farmers.\nThe minister further mentioned that India's rice production this year will be higher than last year despite heavy rains and flooding in some states.\n\"Our overall rice production will be more than last year despite flooding because rice planting is higher this year,\" Mr Chouhan said.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "EVERGREEN, Colo. — Wildfire risks are expected to increase in the years ahead in Colorado due to a warming climate, so state lawmakers are now exploring ways to help mitigate future impacts. Those who haven't visited Alderfer/Three Sisters Park in Jefferson County recently may notice it looks a little different these days, with many of the trees that used to adorn the landscape gone. Steve Murdock with Jefferson County Open Space told Denver7 Thursday it was part of a major mitigation project completed earlier this year. “Thinning these forests out leads to resilience,” said Murdock. “The trees that we keep out here are better able to withstand that fire that is inevitably going to come through.” Thinning trees removes some of the fuel that wildfires depend on to intensify and grow, helping firefighters protect nearby homes and roadways that serve as escape routes. \"We live in an environment that was designed to burn, and we have to be aware of those risks,” said Jessica Moore, the wildland fire coordinator for Evergreen Fire and Rescue. “We're working against the clock. We've been incredibly lucky in this area, in particular to avoid any major catastrophic wildfires.” On Thursday, Moore and Murdock gave local, county and state leaders a tour of the Alderfer/Three Sisters Park mitigation project, including members of the legislature’s wildfire matters review committee. \"We've been hearing from different departments and agencies about what kind of things they need in this space,” said State Sen. Lisa Cutter, D-Littleton, who chairs the committee. One area they’re focused on is easing the burden on firefighters, who are spread thin. A [2023 state report](https://dfpc.colorado.gov/2022FFNeedsAssessment) found Colorado needs about 1,100 firefighters and 1,300 volunteer firefighters. But filling that gap won't be easy. “We have severe constraints on our budget at the state level,” Cutter said. “And so, we're really trying to find that right balance between suppression, mitigation, detection, workforce.” The committee recently [advanced legislation](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/iwmrc2024alegislation) to boost the forestry workforce, promote firefighting opportunities, and strengthen wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts. One of the bills the committee advanced would also provide $7.5 million to study and develop artificial intelligence applications to help with fires.

[ ](https://www.denver7.com/news/wildfire/noaa-using-ai-to-scan-satellite-imagery-identify-wildfires-right-when-they-start) Wildfire NOAA using AI to scan satellite imagery, identify wildfires as they start But Cutter has doubts about the bill, given the tight budget. “I’m not sure that it’s going to pass to be honest with you,” Cutter said. “We’ve got a $920 million plus deficit in our budget, so I’m not sure really what path forward that bill will have or not.” The Legislative Council will review proposals submitted by the Wildfire Matters Review Committee in the coming weeks. If approved, the bills will be introduced in next year’s legislative session.

    "text": "It’s been a rollercoaster season for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, especially after missing out on the playoffs. But even with all the ups and downs, the Prescott family just got a big reason to smile. And it’s not on the football field in Dallas.\nTurns out, Prescott’s nephew, Jaymez Beaner, has officially joined the Angelo State Rams football team, and Dak couldn’t be prouder. He shared a story on Instagram, “Congratulations Nephew @_.jaymez @cobiloc29 Now y’all can have matching tattoos of a Ram lol.” Jaymez didn’t hold back either, sharing his own pic with the caption, “Go Rams💙💛 #Blessed.” It’s clear—Jaymez is ready to bring his A-game to the next level in the Lone Star Conference.\nView this post on Instagram\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAngelo State has a pretty solid football program, with a history of producing some serious talent. The Rams’ alumni list includes former NFL players like Chris Ivory and Brandon Johnson. With coach Jeff Girsch leading the charge, Jaymez is joining a team with a strong legacy of success. It’s extra special for him since he’s repping his home state of Texas. Where the football community is all about passion and pride for their teams.\nBefore making the move to Angelo State, Jaymez put in work at Lovejoy High School in Lucas, Texas (not to be confused with the other Lovejoy in Georgia). Known for its competitive football team, Lovejoy helped shape Prescott’s nephew into the athlete he is today, showcasing his skills and determination on the field.\nJaymez is clearly pumped for this next chapter. He posted on X, saying, “#AGTG BEYOND BLESSED 💙💛,” tagging Angelo State’s WR coach @Coach_JJohnson and Offensive Coordinator @KevinKilmer. He’s definitely ready to put in the work and take his game to the next level with the Rams.\nAs for Prescott, there’s been plenty of buzz about what’s next for him in Dallas. While trade rumors are heating up, he seems focused on celebrating family wins for now. Whether QB Prescott stays with the Cowboys or finds a new home, it’s clear his nephew’s success is a proud moment for the entire Prescott crew.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nWill Dak Prescott's family pride overshadow the swirling trade rumors about his future with the Cowboys?\nHave an interesting take?\nThe trade rumors and Dak Prescott’s future\nWhile Dak Prescott’s family is celebrating his nephew Jaymez Beaner’s big move to Angelo State, the rumor mill around Prescott’s future with the Cowboys is still spinning. Even though the QB has been a cornerstone for Dallas, there’s been talk about him potentially being traded, or his contract being restructured to free up cap space for other players to be added to the Cowboys’ roster.\nA Heavy article fueled the speculations of trade, wondering if the Cowboys might look to move on from Dak Prescott. But ESPN’s Adam Schefter quickly shut it down, calling the idea “fantasy football.” He made it clear that it’s super unlikely the Cowboys would trade their starting QB, especially given Dak’s leadership and importance to the offense.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nDespite his injury woes this season, it can’t be denied that the QB pulled in decent numbers. I mean, he pulled in 1900+ passing yards in mere 8 games that he attended with 11 TDs to his name. While interceptions remained an issue for the QB, overall, the team has multiple other pain points that could be better focused on rather than trading Prescott and losing a key player.\nFor now, the QB seems focused on supporting his family and staying positive through the offseason. Whether he sticks with the Cowboys or explores other options, one thing’s for sure—the Prescott family’s football legacy is only growing, with Jaymez now part of the Angelo State Rams, and Dak couldn’t be prouder. Rest assured, the pieces of the puzzle will slowly fall into place as the Dallas team will unravel their strategies for the next season.\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\nChallenge Your Sports Knowledge!\nSolve the puzzle and prove your knowledge of iconic players, terms, and moments.\nDebate\nWill Dak Prescott's family pride overshadow the swirling trade rumors about his future with the Cowboys?",
