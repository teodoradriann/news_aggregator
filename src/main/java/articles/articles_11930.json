    "text": "The Catholic Church on Thursday expressed concerns over the potential expansion of Sharia law in Southwest Nigeria .\nThe church warned that such move is possible of heightening religious tensions and could lead to conflict in the region.\nThe Church also called for careful deliberation, emphasising the importance of upholding religious freedom and ensuring that no religious group is favoured over another in the region.\nThe issue was deliberately upon during the 5th Edition of the media parley with the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) Community, held in Abuja.\nThe event featured key Church leaders, including Rev. Fr. Lawrence Emehel, Director of the Mission and Dialogue Department, who addressed the discussions surrounding the introduction of Sharia law.\nHe acknowledged the constitutional allowances for Sharia law in personal matters but urged that it be implemented cautiously to avoid disenfranchising other religious groups.\nHe stressed that any legal reform must ensure inclusivity and respect for religious diversity in Southwest Nigeria.\nThe CSN official said: “The question at hand is the introduction of Sharia law in Southwest Nigeria, and the position of the Church must be clarified first and foremost. The current desire for Sharia law stems from dissatisfaction with the existing system.\n“The Church views this situation through the lens of understanding and trust. It is essential to recognise that Southwest Nigeria is a melting pot of diverse religious beliefs. Favouring one group over another could lead to conflict, especially in families with different religious traditions.\n“The Catholic Church in Nigeria calls for caution—not to dismiss the legitimate desires of the people, but to acknowledge that we do not exist in isolation. It is crucial that the implementation of these laws does not inhibit or restrict others in their practices. Our identity as Nigerians is paramount, and this must not be undermined. The constitution guarantees religious liberty, but careful consideration is necessary to prevent discrimination or exclusion”.\nAnother critical issue discussed at the event was the rise of neo-paganism among youths, which the Church views as a growing challenge.\nRev. Fr. Boniface Idoko, National Youth Animator, addressed the alarming trend of young Nigerians turning to pagan practices as a temporary escape from socio-economic difficulties.\nHe attributed this shift to a decline in family values and the overwhelming influence of social media.\nThe priest said: “Our youths are drawn to whatever seems to offer immediate relief or support, often leading them to pagan practices as a temporary escape from their challenges. The socio-economic environment undermines their mental stability, and old practices are resurfacing.\n“The decline in family values has left children influenced by the streets and social media. Without proper guidance, young people are easily swayed. The Church recognises its role as a nurturing force and is organising training sessions to redirect young minds towards true faith and worship. We aim to instil values against materialism and moral neglect, and to renew hope and understanding of faith. With God’s help, we hope to reclaim our youth”.\nConcerning reforms, Rev. Fr. Augustine Okochi, Director of the Pastoral Agents Department, spoke about necessity of the Church’s active participation in ongoing consultations with the government regarding educational reforms, particularly the proposed 12-4 education system.\nFr. Okochi reiterated the importance of ensuring that all stakeholders, including the Church, have a say in the shaping of educational policies that affect the future of Nigeria’s youth.\nHe said: “We recognise the importance of consulting all stakeholders before major decisions. Collaboration between the Church and government has historically been successful, and we hope to continue this partnership. We are engaged in consultations and monitoring the government’s actions in education”.",

The Thursday 6pm accident involved a 14-seater matatu, a saloon car and a motorcycle. Confirming the incident to Nation.Africa, Kieni West Deputy Sub County Police Commander Bernard Muthomi said one of the motorists had swerved to avoid hitting a pothole when the accident occurred. \"The accident occurred in Solio area and six people died, 14 are seriously injured while one sustained minor injuries,\" Mr Muthomi said by phone. \"The driver of the saloon car was avoiding potholes on the highway and this is believed to have caused the accident,\" he added. He urged motorists to drive carefully during and after the festive season. Mr Stephen Ndegwa, an eyewitness and a regular motorist on the route, said the road had claimed the lives of many motorists and appealed to the government to fill the potholes. \"So many people have lost their lives along this bridge. It is a sharp bend and a very dangerous black spot at the entrance to Solio Ranch. Something should be done by the Kenya National Highway Authority to ensure the safety of most of us who use this road regularly,\" said Mr Ndegwa.",

    "text": "The governor of Florida declared a state of emergency on Thursday as a tropical system moved toward the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to bring heavy rain, gusty winds and the potential for flash flooding.\nKnown currently as Invest 97L, the storm could become Debby if it organizes itself into an official tropical storm. (“Invest” is meteorological shorthand for “investigative area.”)\nThe U.S. National Weather Service warned that heavy rains could cause areas of flash flooding across Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas through the weekend.\nFlorida braces for what could be a ‘major disaster.’ With heavy rainfall of at least 12 inches expected over the next seven days, Florida is bracing for the threat of flooding, along with gusty winds and erosion. On Thursday night, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in more than 50 counties, which gives emergency managers the authority to allocate resources to respond to the fallout of the extreme weather.\nThe order covers Orange County and Osceola County, and travel could be disrupted for the throngs of summer visitors who go to Orlando and the theme parks at Universal Studios Florida and Walt Disney World.\nWater tables in some areas are already saturated, the governor said, and the incoming rainfall “will cause significant river flooding that may last for several weeks.” The storm could damage “major interstates and roadways, bridges, airports, schools, hospitals, power grids and other critical infrastructure,” Mr. DeSantis said. It was expected to also cause widespread power outages from downed trees and power lines.\nThe National Hurricane Center said that an aircraft would investigate the storm on Friday if needed, and it warned officials in Cuba and the Bahamas to monitor its progress.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the forecast. The cluster of storms was over Cuba on Friday morning and will move over the Straits of Florida late in the day into Saturday, and over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. Over water, the thunderstorms are expected to organize into a tropical depression and will most likely become a named storm before making landfall sometime late Sunday into early Monday.\nForecasters in Tallahassee warned that landfall could occur anywhere from Apalachicola to the Tampa Bay area. The farther north the storm gets before it makes landfall, the more opportunity it has to strengthen, and a hurricane is not out of the question. When a storm system’s wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour, it becomes a tropical storm and is given a name. At 74 m.p.h., it becomes a hurricane.\nWhether the storm becomes a hurricane or even gets a name, three to five inches of rain are expected to fall across Florida in a short amount of time, posing a risk for flash flooding. Higher amounts are possible in some areas, depending on where the storm system tracks and evolves through the weekend. The heaviest rain will fall to the right of the storm’s path.\nAfter landfall, the storm will most likely move across Florida and emerge back over the Atlantic, slowly skirting up the East Coast along Georgia and the Carolinas. That is the likeliest scenario, but the forecast is unclear beyond Sunday.\nThere is significant uncertainty in this storm’s forecast. It may miss its exit ramp to the north and remain in the Gulf of Mexico, although this is no longer the most likely scenario. It is slightly more likely that after pounding the shores of the southeastern Atlantic coast with tropical rain and dangerous surf through most of next week, the storm will wander off into the open ocean. Or it could curve back toward the Carolinas, making another landfall. Forecasters expect much more clarity in the coming days, once they see what the storm does in the Gulf.\nThis hurricane season is expected to be busy. There have been three named storms so far this season. Alberto made landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico as a tropical storm on June 20, unleashing heavy rain, flooding and gusty winds. At least four people died in events related to the storm.\nBeryl formed a little over a week later and became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. It carved a path of destruction through the Caribbean before crossing into the Gulf of Mexico and hitting the Texas coast. Also in July, Tropical Storm Chris formed just before making landfall , in Mexico.\nForecasters have warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be much more active than usual.\nIn late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 17 to 25 named storms this year , an “above-normal” number and a prediction in line with more than a dozen forecasts earlier in the year from experts at universities, private companies and government agencies. Hurricane seasons produce 14 named storms, on average.\nThe seasonal hurricane outlooks were notably aggressive because forecasters looking at the start of the season saw a combination of circumstances that didn’t exist in records dating back to the mid-1800s: record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the potential formation of the weather pattern known as La Niña.\nLa Niña occurs in the Pacific because of changing ocean temperatures, and it affects weather patterns globally. When it is strong, it typically provides a calm environment in the Atlantic; this allows storms to develop more easily and to strengthen without interference from wind patterns that might otherwise keep them from organizing.\nThe post Parts of Florida Under State of Emergency as Storm Moves Toward the Gulf appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "Deutschland ächzt unter Extremtemperaturen: Jetzt könnte der Hitzekollaps kommen\nStraßen platzen auf, Züge versagen, Menschen kollabieren. Die Hitzewelle offenbart ein bitteres Versagen von Deutschlands Infrastruktur. Eine Wetter-Kolumne von Dominik Jung.\nFrankfurt – Es ist heiß, unerträglich heiß, und Deutschland beginnt zu brechen. Die aktuelle Hitzewelle jagt neue Rekorde, doch was wirklich erschüttert, ist nicht die Temperatur – es ist, wie wenig das Land der Extreme gewachsen ist. Es fehlt an entsprechender Infrastruktur und verpflichtenden Maßnahmen zur Schaffung dieser.\nWetter-Extreme im Sommer 2025 lassen Autobahnen aufplatzen und Technik versagen\nAuf Autobahnen platzen Betonplatten auf, sogenannte Blow-ups reißen metergroße Wölbungen in den Asphalt. Autos verunglücken, der Verkehr wird gesperrt, die Gefahr ist buchstäblich explosiv. Und das passiert nicht zum ersten Mal – aber immer wieder, mit steigender Regelmäßigkeit. Die Sonne trifft das Material – und unser System – mit voller Wucht.\nAuch die Deutsche Bahn kämpft. Züge bleiben liegen, Klimaanlagen versagen, Fahrgäste sitzen stundenlang in überhitzten Waggons fest. Fenster lassen sich nicht öffnen, die Temperatur klettert auf über 40 Grad – innen. Kinder weinen, Menschen kollabieren, Notärzte müssen anrücken. Die Leitungen hängen durch, die Weichen klemmen, und der Fahrplan ist längst ein Fantasieprodukt. Ein Land, das für Kälte gebaut wurde, sieht der Sonne hilflos dabei zu, wie sie alles zum Stillstand bringt.\nStädte als Brutöfen: Hitzeschutz? Fehlanzeige\nDie Städte glühen. Und mit ihnen die Gebäude, in denen Menschen arbeiten, lernen, gepflegt oder behandelt werden sollen. In Schulen herrschen Zustände wie im Backofen, in Pflegeheimen ist Lüften der einzige Plan, und viele Krankenhäuser haben weder Hitzeschutzfenster noch Klimatisierung.\nDie Politik mahnt zur Vorsicht, empfiehlt Wasser, Ruhe und Schatten – doch Schatten gibt es kaum in urbanen Betonlandschaften. Kein systematischer Hitzeschutz, keine hitzeangepasste Bauordnung, keine verpflichtenden Maßnahmen. Während Südeuropa längst handelt, streitet man in Berlin noch über Zuständigkeiten.\nGleichzeitig beginnt das Stromnetz zu ächzen. Die Klimaanlagen, wo sie existieren, laufen durchgehend. Supermärkte, Rechenzentren und Industrie kämpfen um Kühlung. Erste lokale Stromausfälle werden gemeldet. Und dann kommt das Wasserproblem: Flüsse wie Rhein, Elbe und Donau führen kaum noch Wasser – zu warm, zu wenig – und behindern damit die Kühlung von Kraftwerken. Die Hitze trifft alles gleichzeitig: Infrastruktur, Energie, Gesundheit – und niemand scheint darauf vorbereitet.\nwetter.net - das Wetter auf den Punkt gebracht!\nDieser Artikel entstand in einer Content-Partnerschaft mit wetter.net. wetter.net bietet Ihnen alles Wissenswerte rund um Wetter und Klima. Auf unseren Seiten finden Sie weltweite Stadt- und Ortsprognosen für die nächsten 14 Tage und das für die ersten 7 Tage in 1-stündiger und für die nachfolgenden Tage in 3-stündiger zeitlicher Auflösung. Wettervorhersagen, Niederschlagsradar, Messwerte, Wetterwarnungen, Deutschlandwetter und Wetter-News informieren über die aktuelle Entwicklung sowie die kommenden Stunden und Tage.\nHitzesommer 2025 ist der Beginn eines neuen Normalzustands – Jetzt ist schnelles Handeln gefragt\nDas Jahr 2025 wird als Wendepunkt in Erinnerung bleiben – oder als verpasste Warnung. Denn was wir gerade erleben, ist nicht das Extrem eines Jahrhundertsommers. Es ist der Beginn eines neuen Normalzustands. Der Klimawandel ist da, nicht als Schlagzeile, sondern als Realität, die Straßen zerreißt, Bahnen lahmlegt und Menschenleben gefährdet. Und noch immer fehlt ein flächendeckender Hitzeschutzplan, ein Konzept für hitzetaugliches Bauen, eine Strategie für Städte im Ausnahmezustand.\nDeutschland war vorbereitet auf Schnee, aber nicht auf Sonne. Wir streuen bei Glätte, räumen bei Frost, planen Umleitungen bei Eis. Doch gegen Hitze? Da hilft bisher nur improvisieren – oder hoffen. Und das reicht nicht mehr. Wenn der Sommer so weitergeht – und die Prognosen deuten genau darauf hin – steht nicht weniger als die Funktionsfähigkeit unserer Gesellschaft auf dem Spiel. Und das nächste Hochdruckgebiet wartet bereits.",
