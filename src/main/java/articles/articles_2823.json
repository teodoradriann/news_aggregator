    "title": "Common Sleep Aid Linked to Alzheimer's Risk by Disrupting Brain's Waste-Clearing System",
    "text": "A groundbreaking study has revealed that⁢ a widely used sleep ⁢medication may interfere⁤ wiht the brain’s natural waste-clearing system,potentially increasing the risk of⁢ neurodegenerative diseases.‍ Published in the journal Cell , the ​research sheds light on the⁢ intricate processes that occur during ​sleep and how they contribute to brain health.\nSleep is more than just a ⁢time for rest—it’s a critical ⁢biological process that supports ‍brain function, strengthens⁢ the immune system, and promotes cardiovascular ​health. However, sleep disorders such as insomnia and ⁢sleep apnea can disrupt these benefits, leading to​ long-term health issues. Poor⁢ sleep has even ⁢been linked to the onset of neurodegenerative conditions like‌ Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe study, led by Maiken nedergaard, codirector of the University of Rochester Center for Translational Neuromedicine, explores the‌ role​ of the glymphatic system—a network responsible for flushing out ‍toxic proteins like amyloid and ​tau from the brain. ‌“As the brain transitions from wakefulness to sleep, processing​ of external details diminishes while processes such ​as glymphatic removal of waste ⁣products are activated,” Nedergaard explains.\nthe⁣ Glymphatic System and⁢ Sleep Using advanced techniques‍ like flow fiber photometry,electroencephalography,and electromyography,researchers observed the brain activity of mice during natural ⁣sleep​ cycles. Unlike previous studies that relied on anesthesia, ‌this approach allowed the mice to move freely, providing a more accurate depiction of sleep dynamics.\nThe team discovered that⁤ during non-REM sleep, synchronized ⁣waves of norepinephrine—a neurotransmitter linked to arousal and stress—triggered rhythmic changes in ‌blood flow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement. These oscillations, known as vasomotion, act as a pump, driving the glymphatic ⁤system to clear waste ‌from⁤ the brain.\n“These findings, ​combined with what we know about the glymphatic system, paint the whole ⁣picture of the dynamics ​inside the brain,” says Natalie Hauglund, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral⁤ fellow at the ⁤University of Oxford. ⁢“The slow waves,micro-arousals,and⁤ norepinephrine were the⁣ missing link.”\nThe hidden Dangers of Sleep⁣ Aids One⁣ of the study’s most striking findings ‍involves the sleep medication zolpidem,commonly sold‌ under the brand ‍name Ambien. While the drug effectively induced sleep​ in mice, it also suppressed the norepinephrine oscillations ⁢essential for glymphatic function. This disruption impaired the brain’s ability⁣ to clear harmful proteins, raising concerns about the long-term use of ⁤such medications.\n“The research⁤ provides a mechanistic link between norepinephrine dynamics, vascular activity,⁤ and glymphatic clearance, advancing understanding of sleep’s restorative functions,” ‌Nedergaard notes. “It also calls attention to the potentially detrimental effects of certain pharmacological sleep aids on brain health, highlighting the necessity of preserving natural sleep architecture for optimal brain function.”\nImplications for Brain ⁣Health This‌ study not only deepens ⁤our understanding of how sleep supports brain health but ​also underscores the importance of natural sleep cycles. Disrupting these cycles, whether through sleep disorders or medications, can have far-reaching ‍consequences for neurological ⁤health.\nAs researchers continue‌ to explore​ the⁢ glymphatic system and its role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases, the findings serve as a⁢ reminder of the delicate balance required ‍for restorative sleep.​ For⁢ those struggling with sleep issues, the study suggests that non-pharmacological‌ interventions might potentially be a safer option to preserve brain health.\nThe research was supported by the Novo⁢ Nordisk Foundation, the⁣ National Institutes of‍ Health, the US Army ‍Research Office, the⁢ Human Frontier Science Program, the Dr. Miriam and‍ Sheldon G.‌ Adelson Medical ⁣Research Foundation,⁤ the Simons Foundation, and the Cure ​Alzheimer Fund.\nWhat are the implications of the study’s findings⁣ for individuals who use sleep medications? Interview with ⁤Dr. ‍Emily Carter, Neuroscientist ‍and Sleep Health⁢ Expert\nBy Archyde​ News\nArchyde: Dr. Carter, thank you for joining us today. A groundbreaking study published ‍in Cell has revealed that a common ⁢sleep medication may ​interfere with ⁤the brain’s natural waste-clearing system,potentially increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Can you explain the significance of this revelation?\nDr. Carter: Absolutely, and thank you for ⁣having me. ‌this study​ is a⁤ game-changer in our understanding ⁣of ⁢sleep and ⁣brain⁤ health. the research, led by Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, highlights the critical role of the glymphatic system—a network that‌ acts ​like a “plumbing system” for‍ the brain, flushing out toxic​ proteins such as amyloid and tau during‌ sleep. These proteins are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.The‌ study suggests that certain‌ sleep medications ​may⁣ disrupt this process, leaving the brain less able to clear these harmful substances.\nArchyde: That’s fascinating. Could you elaborate on how the glymphatic‌ system works and why⁢ it’s so crucial? ‌\nDr.​ Carter: of course. The glymphatic system is most active⁣ during non-REM sleep, which is the⁢ deep, restorative phase of ⁢sleep. during ⁤this time, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the brain, washing away⁢ metabolic waste products. Think of it as⁢ a nightly “detox” for⁣ the brain. This process is ⁣tightly synchronized with oscillations in neurotransmitters ⁤like norepinephrine and blood flow. When this system is disrupted—whether by poor ⁢sleep quality or certain medications—it can lead to a buildup of toxic proteins,which over time may contribute ⁢to⁣ cognitive decline and‌ diseases like Alzheimer’s. ⁢\nArchyde: The⁣ study mentions⁢ that sleep​ disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea⁢ can also disrupt these processes. How do these conditions affect the glymphatic​ system?\nDr. Carter: ⁢ Great question. Sleep disorders often prevent individuals from reaching or maintaining the deep,non-REM‌ sleep stages where⁣ the glymphatic system is most⁤ active.⁣ For example, insomnia can lead to fragmented sleep, while sleep apnea causes repeated awakenings due to breathing interruptions. ⁣Both ​conditions reduce the brain’s ability to perform its nightly “cleanup,” increasing the risk of long-term damage. This is why addressing sleep⁤ disorders is so crucial—not just for immediate rest, but for long-term brain health.\nArchyde: The study specifically⁣ points to a common sleep medication as a potential disruptor of this system. Should ​people ⁢be concerned about using sleep ⁤aids?​\nDr. ⁣Carter: It’s important to approach this with ‌caution. The study highlights a potential ⁣risk, but ⁢more ‌research is needed to ‌fully understand how different ⁣medications⁢ affect the ⁣glymphatic system. That said,this is a ⁢wake-up⁢ call for both patients and healthcare providers. Sleep ⁣medications should⁤ be⁣ used​ judiciously,and non-pharmacological approaches—like cognitive behavioral therapy⁢ for insomnia ⁢(CBT-I)‌ or ‍improving sleep hygiene—should be considered as first-line ​treatments.\nArchyde: What advice would you ​give to people who are struggling with sleep but⁢ want to protect their brain health?\ndr. Carter: My top ​suggestion is to prioritize good sleep hygiene. This‌ includes maintaining a ⁣consistent sleep schedule,​ creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding⁣ stimulants like⁤ caffeine close to bedtime.⁤ For ⁢those with chronic sleep issues, seeking professional help is essential. Addressing underlying conditions like sleep apnea‍ or anxiety can make a world ⁤of difference. And, of ‌course, staying ‌informed about new research ⁢like this study can‌ definitely help people make better decisions about their health.⁤\nArchyde: Thank you, Dr. Carter, for shedding light on this critically ⁤important topic. Your insights are‌ invaluable.\nDr. carter: ‌Thank you for having me. It’s always a pleasure‌ to discuss⁢ the fascinating intersection of ​sleep and brain⁤ health.\nEnd of Interview\nThis interview highlights the critical findings of the study while providing actionable advice for readers. It underscores ‍the importance of sleep for brain health and the potential risks ⁢associated with certain sleep medications, all while ⁣maintaining a ⁢professional and engaging tone.",

    "title": "A man defended himself on a murder charge and lost. Here's how the prosecutors beat him",
    "text": "A man who took a chance in representing himself on a murder charge failed to convince jurors that he did not shoot the 60-year-old woman to whom he owed $20,000. Ann Witherspoon was found dead in February 2019, days after she traveled from Mount Pleasant to Myrtle Beach to meet with Norman Phillip Browne, the 49-year-old defendant, in an attempt to recoup the thousands she invested in his company. She initially believed she would turn a profit but later began to feel uneasy about their deal. She died in her Old Village home, shot in the head by a gun her father gave her for protection. At first glance, the scene may have looked like a suicide. But DNA, photo, video and other evidence presented during the week-and-a-half-long trial in Charleston County Circuit Court convinced jurors that Browne murdered her and staged the scene to look like a suicide in a faulty attempt to cover up his tracks. It took the jury about an hour to decide Browne was guilty. He will serve a life sentence. ‘Smooth talker’ Witherspoon, a lifelong Mount Pleasant resident, was known for her kindness and devotion to her friends. The retired physical therapist enjoyed music, playing the guitar, admiring cars and riding her two motorcycles. She was extremely independent and lived alone on Seminole Street in Old Village, a historic Mount Pleasant neighborhood. She never married or had children. “She enjoyed getting to know people and doing nice things for her friends,” Chief Deputy Solicitor Jennifer Shealy told the jury during opening statements on April 15. When she met Browne at an area Honest-1 Auto Care, the two struck up a conversation about cars. Browne shared with her his dream of owning a Matco Tool Truck franchise. A “smooth talker,” he convinced her to give him a $20,000 loan to start the franchise, promising he would pay her back at a high interest rate, Shealy said. Witherspoon thought it would be a learning opportunity and profitable, according to Shealy. But she never asked for official paperwork documenting the loan. Little did she know that Browne’s girlfriend had already given him the money for his franchise, according to Shealy. Witherspoon’s money went to something else entirely, she alleged. Browne began “ghosting” Witherspoon after the deal. She started worrying she wouldn’t get her initial investment back, let alone any promised interest. “She really wanted to get that money back,” Mary Webb, a friend of Witherspoon’s, said. “It was a substantial amount of money.” Witherspoon agreed to meet Browne in Myrtle Beach on Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019, to discuss the loan. (Browne lived in a West Ashley home with his girlfriend but rented a Myrtle Beach apartment near his MetCo trucking route.) She chose to drive her ailing 90-year-old father’s Cadillac up the coast to put some highway miles on it. Taking care of her father was one of her primary responsibilities. It was rare for her to travel far from him. His house was less than a mile down the street from hers. She had agreed to spend the night in Myrtle Beach and head back south on Feb. 7. Webb said Browne and Witherspoon were not romantically involved. Witherspoon and Browne ate chipped steak, peas and carrots at Browne’s Myrtle Beach apartment, according to court records. He would later tell detectives he brought her to a storage facility nearby where he stored his Matco truck. But she allegedly got injured, walking out of the truck holding her head, Browne said, and he decided to drive her back to Mount Pleasant that night in her father’s vehicle. The injury allegedly caused a “significant amount of bleeding,” but no blood was found in her father’s car or on or near Browne’s truck, according to court testimony. Browne said he drove himself back home in her father’s car later that night. Cover-up By Thursday night, Witherspoon’s friends began to worry why they hadn’t heard back from her. Webb stopped by Witherspoon’s home on her way to work Friday morning. The shades were drawn and her doors were locked, which was not unusual. But Webb’s unease didn’t lessen throughout the day. She returned that afternoon with another close friend, Mary Dallas Moore. When they noticed both the Thursday and Friday newspapers were still stuffed into her mailbox, they knew something was horribly wrong. Witherspoon was an avid reader and never missed grabbing the paper, they testified. “I got a very bad feeling,” Webb said. She found Browne’s number online on one of his MatCo advertisements and called him that afternoon. He relayed the story of driving her home Wednesday night, saying they had met up in Wilmington, N.C., Thursday evening so she could get her father’s car back. A large, “long-haired man” was with Witherspoon, Browne told Witherspoon’s friend. But camera footage recovered from Front Street in Wilmington showed otherwise. Neither Witherspoon, nor another man, were spotted. But Browne could be seen stashing the Cadillac in a parking lot near Cape Fear Community College and walking back to a nearby restaurant to hail a cab. He drove to Wilmington alone, parked the car illegally in a college student lot and took an expensive cab ride 74 miles home, Shealy said and court testimony corroborated. That he met Witherspoon in Wilmington is a “bologna” lie, according to Shealy. “Witherspoon was dead the night he left her house,” Shealy said. “She didn’t go to Wilmington.\" Police agreed. Witherspoon’s friends reported her missing on Saturday, Feb. 9, 2019. When firefighters broke down one of her doors and entered the house, they found her dead on her bed under layers of sheets and blankets. Shealy described the scene as “haunting” in court. The coroner estimated she had been dead for more than two days. She had been struck in the head with an unknown object and shot in the back of her head. The revolver was laying near her head, but she was a lefty, and the gun was positioned in her right hand, according to court testimony. “How many people shoot themselves with their nondominant hand?” Shealy asked the jury. “He killed her, he murdered her.” Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal planted further doubt in the minds of the jurors, testifying she had never seen a person shoot themselves in the back of their head. Browne’s foot tapped rapidly as Shealy worked through crime scene photos and images during O'Neal's testimony, causing his body and chair to vibrate. “Find me guilty, I’ll hold no ill will’ Through the course of the seven-day trial, Shealy painted a picture of a man who worked hard, was a great mechanic and wore many faces. He always wanted more, and his sense of ownership extended to the people around him and what he could get from them, she said during a four-hour closing argument on April 24. “He had that feeling, that itching to live larger than he was living previously,” she said. He was calculating, and he used his “gift of gab” to manipulate relationships, Shealy said. In her search to recover her money, Witherspoon threatened to undo everything he built, she said. “His masculinity had been challenged,” she said. A video presented at trial showed Browne disparaging Witherspoon as a “druggie” and making other negative remarks about her to police. He told jurors in his closing argument that he isn’t a perfect person and that Witherspoon was his friend. It was Browne’s first time speaking directly to the group after choosing to waive his right to an opening statement. He said he knows he can be short with people and explode on them when he is stressed and anxious. He described himself as a detail-oriented person who has obsessive-compulsive disorder. “Have I made mistakes? Yes,” he said. But he argued the coroner didn’t follow her own policies and procedures in taking the victim’s temperature to determine the time of death. A key piece of his case to the jury was the lack of what Browne believed to be an accurate time of death. That could have proven he was not present when Witherspoon died, he contended. “What you have is a simple math problem,” Browne said in his closing argument. “Nowhere in evidence did they find a time machine.” Shealy called Browne’s reliance on time of death something straight out of a movie. Evidence from the coroner and pathologist, security cameras, Witherspoon’s unanswered texts and the growing pile of newspapers at her home did not support his claims, according to Shealy. “He is a totally self-absorbed man who has done the unthinkable,” she said. Throughout Browne’s 30-minute closing argument, Shealy lodged upward of 18 objections that Judge Deadra L. Jefferson upheld when Browne tried to introduce new facts as the trial wound down. He ended by telling the jurors they only needed a little doubt to acquit him. He said he would respect their decision if they thought Shealy did her job. “Find me guilty, I’ll hold no ill will,” he said. Witherspoon’s father didn’t live long enough to see the jury avenge his daughter’s death. He died two years after she was killed. “It preyed on his brain the whole time until his passing,” Witherspoon’s sister-in-law, Teddy Witherspoon, previously told The Post and Courier. “He’d always ask, ‘Well, anything about Ann? Anything about her murder?’” And Witherspoon’s brother didn’t have a chance to attend the trial either. He was in the hospital. So her friends bore the burden of telling the jury about the woman they lost too soon. “I loved her dearly,” Webb said, choking up on the stand. “We had a close relationship that lasted many years.” Unless he's paroled or his conviction is overturned on appeal, Browne will spend the rest of his life behind bars.",

Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar. Die Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: «Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.» Birtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland.

V.\nViernes, 10 de mayo 2024, 17:46\nNecesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad.\nCompartir\nLa Tierra sufrirá este fin de semana diversas alteraciones magnéticas. Un fenómeno astronómico se acerca en forma de\ntormenta solar que podrá interrumpir las comunicaciones, la red eléctrica, la navegación y las operaciones de radio y satélite. La NOAA (Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica de los Estados Unidos) ha emitido una alerta de tormenta geomagnética severa (clasificada como G4) para este mismo viernes, 10 de mayo, cuando este potente evento inusual (no se daba algo así desde 2005) podría perturbar significativamente nuestra tecnología e infraestructura. Para comprender la gravedad, el nivel siguiente de alerta sería la G5 que se considera de «peligrosidad extrema».\nLa actividad solar durante estos días ha sido particularmente alta, acercándonos al pico del ciclo solar, que\nse prevé para finales de este año 2024. Los pronósticos actuales proyectan que las luces podrían verse hasta el sur de Alabama y California, según el Centro de Predicción del Clima Espacial de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica. Las posibilidades de ver las luces serán mayores en el norte de Estados Unidos, Canadá y el norte de Europa.\nEste tipo de eventos son habituales y se presentan cuando la energía del viento solar se transfiere de manera eficaz al entorno espacial que rodea la Tierra. Este fenómeno se inscribe dentro del Ciclo Solar 25, el cual se encuentra en su periodo álgido.\nCada 11 años, el Sol invierte sus polos norte y sur, cruciales para entender la frecuencia y la intensidad de estas tormentas, que son frecuentes a causa de variaciones en el viento solar y que provocan cambios considerables en las corrientes, plasmas y campos dentro de la magnetosfera del planeta.\nAdemás, durante estas tormentas, se dan explosiones conocidas como fulguraciones solares, enviando toneladas de energía hacia el espacio, aunque los científicos hacen predicciones sobre cuándo y con qué intensidad se van a producir\nJunto con la atmósfera, la Tierra está rodeada por un campo magnético y ambos funcionan como un escudo protegiendo el planeta de los vientos solares y las fulguraciones del sol. No obstante, esta protección suele fallar y las partículas procedentes de estas tormentas atraviesan este caparazón. Así se producen las auroras boreales y australes.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nComentar es una ventaja exclusiva para suscriptores\n¿Ya eres suscriptor?\nNecesitas ser suscriptor para poder votar.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares speaks to the media on the day of the EU Foreign Ministers meeting addressing the situation in Ukraine, after Russia launched a massive military operation, in Brussels, Belgium, February 25, 2022. REUTERS/Johanna Geron/File Photo\nSpain said yesterday it would join South Africa's case at the UN's top court in which Pretoria has accused Israel of \"genocide\" in the Gaza Strip.\nThe statement came a week after Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognised the state of Palestine, sparking fury from Israel.\n\"Our sole goal is to put an end to the war and to advance on the road of applying the two-state solution\", Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told journalists.\nSouth Africa brought the case before the International Court of Justice last year. It alleges that Israel's Gaza offensive breached the 1948 UN Genocide Convention.\nIsrael has strongly denied the accusation.\nAlbares, asked if he felt Israel's actions in Gaza amounted to genocide, said it was up to the court to decide.\n\"At the moment we see a large-scale war that does not distinguish between civilian and military targets in Gaza, as well as the enormous risk of regional spillover,\" he added.\nSeveral Latin American nations, including Colombia and Mexico, have already joined South Africa's proceedings before the court.\nUntil now, however, no European country has taken that step. Ireland has also indicated it plans to join the case.\nSet up after World War II, the Hague-based ICJ rules in disputes between states.\nThe ICJ on Friday ordered Israel to ensure \"unimpeded access\" to UN-mandated investigators to look into allegations of genocide.\nIn a ruling on January 26, the ICJ also ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent acts of genocide during its military operation in Gaza.\nBut South Africa has since returned several times to the ICJ arguing that the dire humanitarian situation in the territory compels the court to issue further fresh emergency measures.\nOn May 24, the court ordered Israel to \"immediately\" halt its military offensive in the city of Rafah and keep open the key border crossing there for \"unhindered\" humanitarian aid.\nIt also called for the \"unconditional\" release of hostages taken by Palestinian resistance group Hamas on October 7.\n\"It is urgent that we all support the court so that precautionary measures aimed at stopping any military operation are respected,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at an economic forum.\n\"And it is essential that we all strengthen the United Nations, supporting the role of the court as the highest judicial organ of a rules-based international system.\n\"Have no doubt: Spain will stand on the right side of history.\"\nWhile ICJ rulings are legally binding, the court has no concrete means to enforce them. For example, it ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, to no avail.\nSpain is one of the European countries that has been most critical of Israel over the war in Gaza.\nIsrael's military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.",

ASSINAR JÁ ASSINAR JÁ O Brasil fechou 2023 com a confirmação de que nos primeiros 11 meses do ano foram gerados 1.914.467 postos de trabalho, segundo dados recentes do Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados (Caged), compilado pelo Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego. Diante dos números é de se esperar que o consolidado do ano ultrapasse a meta do próprio governo. O ministro do Trabalho e Emprego, Luiz Marinho, ainda no primeiro semestre, insistia na projeção de um saldo de 2 milhões de empregos formais criados no País. Os números de novembro, período tradicional de contratações para o Natal, trouxeram arrefecimento nas contratações, mostrando o segundo pior desempenho do ano - com 130 mil vagas criadas- atrás apenas do mês de janeiro, quando foram computados 86 mil postos. No acumulado de janeiro a novembro, a maior expansão do emprego com carteira assinada ocorreu no setor de serviços, com saldo de 1.067.218 e um peso de 59,8% das contratações do período. No entanto, o saldo positivo foi comum a outros quatro grandes grupamentos econômicos (comércio, agropecuária, construção civil e indústria), assim como nos 26 estados e Distrito Federal. São Paulo permanece como o maior empregador de 2023, com mais de 551 mil empregos, seguido por Minas Gerais, com saldo de mais de 187 mil e Rio de Janeiro, com mais de 165 vagas. Apesar dos números estarem em equilíbrio com a meta do governo, dezembro ainda pode surpreender negativamente, já que é um mês em que invariavelmente acontecem demissões passado o período de contratações de final de ano. Junta-se a isso, o temor de setores estratégicos da economia com os efeitos da Medida Provisória da Reoneração do governo federal em pleno fechamento de 2023. Contrariando decisão do Congresso Nacional que optou pela prorrogação da desoneração da folha de pagamento, a equipe econômica do governo Lula entendeu que a medida é onerosa e inconstitucional. Os efeitos do canetaço sobre o mercado de trabalho devem respingar nesse 2024 e dependerão fortemente dos 17 setores afetados que, juntos, empregam mais de 9 milhões de pessoas no Brasil. Reunidos na organização Movimento Desonera Brasil, tais segmentos chamam a atenção para a insegurança jurídica para as empresas e para os trabalhadores já neste início de ano. E está recém começando.",
