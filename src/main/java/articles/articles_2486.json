Following the surgery, his son LaMelo expressed support on social media, while details about LaVar's recovery remain unknown. LaVar Ball, a Southern California-based businessman who gained a global following as the father of current NBA players LaMelo Ball and Lonzo Ball, needed to get his foot amputated after a health scare.\nWhat we know:\nTMZ first reported the emergency amputation on Wednesday, February 19, saying the elder Ball underwent a procedure to get his right foot taken off. The next day, his youngest son LaMelo took to social media to pay tribute to his old man.\n\"Seen my dawg [before the] game,\" LaMelo Ball wrote in an Instagram story. \"It was only right [I love you] pops 5L and after.\"\nWhat we don't know:\nIt is unknown what medical condition prompted LaVar Ball to undergo leg amputation. A timetable for the basketball dad&apos;s full recovery has not been revealed to the public.\nThe backstory:\nLaVar Ball became a household name for his self-promotion campaigns during the late 2010s and his public support for his three sons: Lonzo, LiAngelo [former NBA player turned rapper] and LaMelo. He advocated for his oldest son Lonzo to get picked by the hometown Lakers, which ended up happening in the 2017 NBA Draft.\nThe Source: This report used information provided by TMZ, which first broke the story.

    "text": "Helena Oliviero | The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (TNS)\nA new report released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows gaps remain in Vaccines for Children, a federally funded program to provide free vaccines to low-income families, with lower vaccination coverage among children living in poverty remaining a persistent problem.\nThis study comes on the heels of another study by the CDC which found that over the past 30 years, routine childhood vaccinations have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations and 1.1 million deaths. But despite these substantial health benefits, attitudes toward childhood vaccinations have shifted, and they are increasingly tough sell.\nA Gallup poll published recently found that just 40% of Americans think it’s “extremely important” for children to get vaccinated, down from about 64% in 2001.\nReaching families at or below the poverty line can be even more difficult. CDC officials pointed to a lack of confidence and a lack of access to vaccines as key reasons for the lower rates among VFC eligible children. They noted vaccine uptake in the first year of life is generally higher and then falls especially among vaccinations requiring multiple doses over several years.\n“We need to do more,” said CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry at a press briefing Tuesday. “Health care providers are our crucial partners to increase the number of children who complete their vaccine series and reach those children living below the poverty level without health insurance.”\nThe study does not include state specific information but major findings of vaccination coverage from 2012 to 2022 in the U.S. include:\n— Only 61% of children born in 2020 who were VFC-eligible received the seven vaccines known as the “combined 7-vaccine series” by their second birthday. This series includes all recommended doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP) vaccine, polio vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the Hib vaccine protecting against Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria , the hepatitis B vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, and the a vaccine (PCV) that helps protect against bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. Among children not VFC eligible also born in 2020, the vaccination rate for this combined 7-vaccine series was 75%.\n— About 90% of VFC-eligible children born in 2020 received at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine. Among those not VFC eligible, coverage rate with at least one dose of MMR vaccine is about 93%.\n— Vaccination coverage was also lower among uninsured children than among Medicaid-insured children. Uninsured children are more likely to have not seen a health care provider in the past year. They are less likely to complete vaccine series that require multiple doses. The vaccination rate was about 62% for the combined 7 vaccines for those with Medicaid coverage and about 39% for those without insurance.\nHoury pointed to important steps by health care providers to help reassure families vaccines about the importance of getting the vaccine, including the following: Offering accurate information on vaccination benefits; giving catch-up vaccines and review for needed vaccines; strengthening relationships with families and setting reminders for families whose children are behind on vaccines.\nThe Vaccines for Children program supplies vaccines for free to participating providers. Children across the country can be eligible in this program aimed at helping those who would not otherwise be able to afford vaccinations. In Georgia, the vaccines are available to children up to 19 years of age who are:\n— Medicaid Enrolled\n— Uninsured (child has no health insurance coverage) or underinsured\n— is American Indian or Alaska Native\nThe Vaccines for Children program is administered nationally by CDC. The federal government purchases pediatric vaccines at a discount and ships them directly to enrolled VFC vaccine providers in Georgia and across the country. Administrative fees for administering vaccines in this program are generally covered by Medicaid.\nRelated Articles Health | US drug price measure to cut costs by $7.5 billion in 2026 Health | Surgeon general hones dual focus on mental health, gun violence Health | ‘I feel dismissed’: People experiencing colorism say health system fails them Health | Arizona and Missouri join states with abortion amendments on the ballot. What would the measures do? Health | Montgomery County to supply period products in county-owned facilities There are about 37,000 VFC providers across the country, according to CDC. In Georgia, there are 1,138 VFC providers which includes public health clinics and private practices. The number has remained steady over the past decade, according to DPH. About half the children in the U.S. receive their vaccinations through the VFC program, according to the CDC.\nOverall, vaccination rates routine childhood shots have still not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Georgia have also hovered below the national average and well below a critical threshold for keeping once-common, serious illnesses at bay, according to the most recent data available.\nIn Georgia for the 2023-2024 school year, 88% of kindergartners received routine vaccinations, which include the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine; the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; the poliovirus (polio) vaccine; and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.\nFor the U.S. overall, 93% of children in kindergarten met the vaccination requirements.\nThe coverage rate for incoming kindergartners likely won’t be available for several months.\n©2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

I'll bet if you put the checkout person at H-E-B in a third grade classroom he or she could teach that third grader to do math at grade level more than 40% of the time.\nThis is shameful.

    "text": "In a pioneering study funded by the UK Government, researchers at Imperial College London are set to examine the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy to treat opioid addiction . As Leafie reported , this marks the first time that the UK government has backed research into using psilocybin for substance addiction, a critical step in broadening the therapeutic tools available for opioid dependency.\nTraditional Treatments Fall Short Amid High Relapse Rates The UK, with some of the highest opioid use rates globally, faces relapse rates near 90% within a year despite treatments like methadone and talk therapies \"Finding new and effective treatments is essential,\" stated Dr. David Erritzoe , Clinical Director at Imperial's Centre for Psychedelic Research. \"If this trial is successful, it offers hope for a new type of treatment that could make a significant difference to this group of people.\"\nPsilocybin And Talk Therapy Combined The study will involve participants recovering from heroin and other opioids, including those on replacement therapies like methadone. Over six months, participants will receive psilocybin doses and therapy, with MRI scans tracking brain response. Dr. Louise Paterson from Imperial's Centre for Psychedelic Research noted, \"This trial will examine whether we can improve recovery in a severely under-served group of people… We want to see if it works equally well for opioid use disorder.\"\nA Collaborative Effort To Reduce Drug-Related Deaths In The UK Funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research under the Addiction Healthcare Goals program, the study is one of four initiatives aimed at reducing drug-related deaths. Professor Anne Lingford-Hughes , chair of the program, emphasized the urgency of innovation in addiction treatment, saying, \"The Addiction Healthcare Goals program is pleased to fund promising innovations that have brought together partnerships between industry, academia and treatment organizations.\"\nRecruitment for participants is slated to begin by spring 2025. If successful, this study could pave the way for psilocybin-assisted therapy as a revolutionary approach in treating opioid addiction.\nNow Read :\nOverdose Crisis In Shadows Of Elections As Black, Indigenous Americans Deaths Rise Cover image made with AI\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2024 Benzinga.com.

    "text": "A secret paper prepared by the Irish government of the day envisaged as much as two-thirds of the land area of Northern Ireland being integrated into the Republic by way of a negotiated repatriation. All of Co Fermanagh, all of Derry city and most of the west of the county including Strabane, Omagh, Castlederg, Dungannon, Cookstown and their hinterlands in Co Tyrone, south Down and south Armagh would be transferred to the Republic leaving Co Antrim as the only intact northern county. Almost 500,000 people living in the North in the mid-1970s would be transferred to the Republic constituting a population of 284,000 Catholics and 201,000 non-Catholics. A minimum area consisting of 40 per cent of the land area of Northern Ireland made up of 323,000 people, 205,000 Catholics and 118,000 non-Catholics was envisaged as an alternative scenario. [X case ‘horror’, ‘gay bashing’, and republican ‘headbangers’: State papers shed light on a turbulent decade](/history/2023/12/28/x-case-horror-gay-bashing-and-republican-headbangers-state-papers-shed-light-on-a-turbulent-decade/) [‘A deeply insecure leader’ and ‘an amiable villain’: What civil servants had to say about North’s politicians](/history/2023/12/28/deeply-insecure-bullying-awful-who-said-what-about-whom-in-the-state-papers/) The issue of who could live where would be decided by plebiscite – an option that was ruled out during the Boundary Commission negotiations of the early 1920s which was set up to draw the boundaries between the 26 and six counties entities. Those who wished not to be part of such arrangements would find the costs of repatriation borne by the British and Irish states. The scenario was drawn unit by the government’s inter-departmental unit on Northern Ireland as part of a series of discussion papers on the future of relationships on the island of Ireland. The paper was similar to an exercise carried out by the Boundary Commission in the 1920s which sought to redraw the Border in line with the wishes of the inhabitants, but shocked the Irish Free State by recommending only minimal changes including parts of the Republic that would be transferred to the North. The commission’s findings were shelved and the present Border remained intact. The cost of redrawing the Border in the 1970s was estimated at between £226 million (€1.7 billion today) and £652 million (€5.3 billion) depending on the amount of destruction that would be done to existing homes as a result of the repatriation exercise. The paper raised the possibility of an independent Northern Ireland rump state involving all the non-Catholic majority areas after repatriation. “One of the main attractions of such a solution for the loyalists would be the prospect of being masters in their own house,” the paper concluded. An alternative majority area rump Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom would need to have its laws supervised by Westminster to ensure that human and civil rights were observed towards the minority Catholic population. The paper was gloomy as to the prospects of such an undertaking being taken by peaceful means. It warned that it might end up in a civil war with more than 300,000 changing residences costing the Republic between £600 million (€4.8 billion) and £800 million (€6.4 billion). This was the equivalent of between a third and half of the total tax take in the State in 1975. “There seems little possibility, on present indications, because of the lack of trust between the two communities that repatriation could emerge as an agreed settlement without the prelude of large-scale violence,” the paper concluded. “Repatriation seems more likely to be adopted as a solution following large-scale inter-communal violence in the wake of British disengagement.”",
