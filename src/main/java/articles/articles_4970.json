    "title": "K-State to launch Donations for Citations program in 2025 - Kansas State Collegian",
    "text": "Kansas State Parking Services will allow students, faculty and staff to reduce one parking citation per academic year by donating 10 or more non-perishable food items or hygiene products to Cat’s Cupboard, K-State’s food pantry.\nThe Donations for Citations program will begin Jan. 21 after the Student Governing Association approved the senate resolution on Oct. 24.\nSenator Andrew Le authored the resolution and said he initially modeled the program after other regional colleges.\n“We looked at other institutions across the country that kind of have some similar programs, donations for citations, food for fines, whatever you call it,” Le said. “Schools like UT Austin have a program like this. Mizzou has a program similar to this, Oklahoma, and so that’s where it started.”\nLe said he worked closely with Parking Services director Adrienne Tucker to build the program after a previous resolution failed to pass the senate last year.\n“Adrienne Tucker came along as the new [parking services] director, and I met with her to kind of fill her in,” Le said. “From there we redid it again, because me and Miss Tucker both agreed that this program should be way more robust than it really was.\nA KSU Foundation survey found nearly 40% of K-state students will experience food insecurity at some point during their college lives.\nShelly Williams, Morrison family director for Cat’s Cupboard, said the program is “a great collaborative effort aimed at increasing food security.”\n“I’m really appreciative of SGA’s support for this, and the parking services support as well,” Williams said. “And the university administration has been really great at helping bring this to fruition.”\nTucker said she dealt with food insecurity in her childhood and wanted to help students save money on citations while also helping out the K-State community.\n“From my own personal experience growing up … It is a cause that is very near and dear to my heart because I’ve been there, and if there’s any way that I can help give back, then I’m all for it,” Tucker said.\nTucker said donation items should be taken to the parking services offices, not Cat’s Cupboard.\n“It’s not going to change parking services, per se, but anyone who receives a citation for a non-registered or parked in a wrong location, they’ll be able to donate 10 items,” Tucker said. “They’re going to bring them into parking services, and we’ll waive that citation as a one-time courtesy. Right now, we’re going to do one per person per academic year. We’re going to see in May what that looks like and how many citations that we’ve waived, and see if we can’t bump that up to one a semester, it’s all just going to depend on how many people took advantage of the program.”\nLe said K-state students can volunteer to transport the donated items to Cat’s Cupboard.\n“We need people to be able to take the goods from there to the Cat’s Cupboard, and so it’s just trying to find people who are willing to do that,” Le said. “People need volunteer hours, and so [we are] creating some incentive for senators and other people of SGA, or even just other people at K-State who want to volunteer, to be able to get them to do that.”\nLe said while working with other universities, he learned the University of Kansas wanted to implement a similar program.\n“This is a super cool program that we’re going to be able to implement here, and KU is trying to get something similar like this up,” Le said. “If we can get it before them, that’d be great.”",

Secondo uno studio , realizzato da ricercatori italiani dell'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia , dalle sedi di Bologna e Roma, e dell'Università olandese di Radboud , in alcune zone del Mediterraneo il livello del mare sta salendo a velocità tripla rispetto alle stime fatte finora . Le proiezioni realizzate dai ricercatori italiani fanno prevedere che come conseguenza di tale innalzamento oltre 38.500 chilometri quadrati di coste saranno presto a rischio inondazione .\nLe misurazioni dei mareografi (cioè gli strumenti che registrano le variazioni del livello del mare e ne stabiliscono il valore medio in un determinato luogo n.d.r ,) e i dati dell'altimetria radar satellitare mostrano che il livello medio globale del mare (GMSL) negli ultimi due secoli sta aumentando a ritmi più rapidi rispetto agli ultimi millenni a causa del riscaldamento globale, scrivono i ricercatori nell'introduzione. A complicare la situazione del nostro mare, però, c'è anche \"l'azione combinata delle variazioni della Terra solida e dell'oceanografia\" guidate da processi geofisici e climatici .\n\"La subsidenza, cioè il lento movimento verso il basso del suolo dovuto a cause naturali o antropiche, ha un ruolo cruciale nell'accelerare l'aumento del livello del mare lungo le coste, innescato dal riscaldamento globale a partire dal 1880\", osserva Marco Anzidei , dell'Ingv, autore dello studio con Antonio Vecchio ed Enrico Serpelloni . \"Le nostre analisi mostrano che, proprio a causa della subsidenza, in alcune zone del Mediterraneo il livello del mare sta aumentando a una velocità quasi tripla rispetto alle zone stabili \", aggiunge Vecchio dell'Università di Radboud, primo autore della ricerca.\nLa letteratura scientifica sugli effetti del cambio climatico da tempo sottolinea come siano molteplici le variabili che possono rendere una zona più vulnerabile rispetto a un'altra . In questo caso, i ricercatori sottolineano come \"la regione mediterranea sia il risultato dell'evoluzione della convergenza tra le placche africana ed euroasiatica attraverso un confine est-ovest attivo fin dal tardo Cretaceo. Queste placche si stanno ancora scontrando a una velocità di pochi millimetri all'anno e la sismicità della regione è caratterizzata da fasce sismiche ben definite\". In sintesi: insieme all'innalzamento del mare dovuto al cambio climatico, in questo complesso quadro tettonico, i processi geologici e geodinamici stanno causando continue ed episodiche deformazioni della crosta terrestre legate ai terremoti, che interessano anche le aree costiere .\nAll'interno della complessa situazione mediterranea l'Italia è seconda soltanto all'Egitto in quanto a esposizione a fattori di rischio . Nello studio si legge infatti che \"è possibile identificare le zone costiere del Mediterraneo più esposte alle inondazioni nei prossimi decenni. Queste corrispondono ad aree poco elevate , dove l'esposizione alle inondazioni aumenta quanto più bassa è la loro elevazione sul livello medio del mare\" e che \"molte di queste aree sono interessate da subsidenza del terreno, erosione costiera e pressione antropica che accelerano il processo di inondazione, esponendole a un crescente rischio costiero nei prossimi decenni , compresi i siti del patrimonio culturale\".\nTali siti più esposti sono quelli di Egitto (12.879 km 2 ), Italia (10.060 km 2 ) e Francia (3.681 km 2 ). \"In questi Paesi, i delta fluviali del Nilo (Egitto, circa 12.879 km 2 ), del Po (Italia, circa 4.000 km 2 ) e del Rodano (Francia, circa 2.000 km 2 ), che stanno subendo elevati tassi di subsidenza del terreno, a causa di processi naturali (compattazione del suolo) e antropici (sfruttamento dei fluidi sotterranei) sono così ad alto rischio di inondazioni nel 2050-2100-2150\" I ricercatori sottolineano poi una cosa importante: \"Vale la pena notare che la maggior parte della popolazione che vive lungo le coste del Mediterraneo non è a conoscenza dell'innalzamento del livello del mare , della subsidenza del suolo e dei relativi rischi costieri che hanno un impatto sull'ambiente, sulle infrastrutture costiere e sulle attività umane\".\nPer l'Italia, le coste più a rischio sono quelle di Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna e Puglia settentrionale per il versante adriatico, insieme a quelle di Toscana, Lazio e in parte della Sardegna per quello tirrenico. Nella ricerca, osserva Serpelloni , sono stati utilizzati i dati dei sistemi di navigazione satellitare, che permettono di calcolare in maniera estremamente precisa le velocità di spostamento verticale del suolo. Alla luce di questi dati, i tre ricercatori hanno ricalcolato le attuali proiezioni fino al 2150 in 265 zone del Mediterraneo. \"Nelle aree risultate più a rischio ci saranno maggiori impatti sull'ambiente, sulle attività umane e sulle infrastrutture\", dice Anzidei: \"È quindi necessario - conclude - intraprendere azioni concrete a sostegno delle popolazioni costiere \".\nArgomenti clima news mediterraneo",

    "text": "Man Saved By Tesla FSD Max Paul Franklin was saved by Tesla FSD recently and recounts the story as so: On April 1st, Tesla unlocked Full Self-Driving capability for all Tesla vehicles in America. In a moment of dire need, at 2:00 am the following morning, I found myself grappling with severe dehydration and a blood glucose level of 670 due to a malfunction in my insulin pump. With no time to spare, I turned to my Model Y for assistance. Engaging the new Full Self-Driving feature with a simple double click on the steering column stalk, I was astounded by the results. Without any intervention, the car skillfully navigated the 13-mile journey from my home to the VA Emergency Room, offering to autonomously park it upon arrival and let me seek immediate medical attention. Despite enduring a mild heart attack, I left the hospital with no restrictions on my exercise regimen, a testament to the swift and efficient response facilitated by the vehicle and the # 1 VA in America. As an owner of luxury vehicles including Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Acura, and Cadillac, I can unequivocally declare Tesla the pinnacle of automotive innovation today. Its lifesaving capabilities in critical moments underscore its superiority. The leap from traditional vehicles to Tesla's Full Self-Driving functionality is like upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone. As a resident of a solar-powered home, the cost of energy for the last 7000 miles has been minimal, I've saved nearly $1000. I extend my gratitude to Elon Musk for his crazy erratic leadership in advancing technology that is more than just transportation. As someone who shares Elon's place \"on the spectrum\", I am particularly appreciative of his commitment to excellence and innovation. He has profoundly impacted our world and personally impacted my own. Thanks, Tesla, and thanks, Charles George VA Medical Center team! Tesla FSD Avoids Oncoming Truck By Driving Up On a Curb To the Right [https://t.co/w3HZZppqXK] [$TSLA] [@Tesla] [@torquenewsauto] [@cgdavemac] [#evs] [#software] [#fsd] [#autonomy] [#safety] — Jeremy Noel Johnson (@AGuyOnlineHere) [April 4, 2024] Elon Musk even responded to the man, saying he was glad Tesla FSD was there to help and that he is feeling well. One could argue that making FSD not accessible - or even delaying its launch could be a moral hazard for those who need their car to drive them and are not able to at the moment. It is also a hazard for those who are on the road and have some kind of heart issue or stroke and need their car to continue driving. FSD will keep the person safe as it continues to improve and does not need intervention. With all this being said, it's important to remember - FSD is not yet autonomous and requires driver intervention where appropriate.

It will also save lives by being able to drive people who are unable to drive themselves, face a medical emergency, or have a medical condition that warrants a car that drives itself. These applications of FSD are the little known ways that it will benefit humanity. The AI can take over in case of an emergency and will also help an aging population drive into their later years. I remember when I had to have my appendix taken out in 2019. That was 5 years ago, and I had to drive myself to the hospital 15 minutes away. It was excruciating. It would have been a lot easier right now in a Tesla that can drive itself, which I am fortunate to have.

It will never get drunk. Nor distracted. It won't get emotional on the road or angry. The car will always do its very best to get from point a to point b. It treats all people, animals, and living things with the utmost respect. Situations like the one that happened here with Max Paul Franklin will happen in the future, and having a car that can drive itself will be very important. Autonomous technology is here to stay.

    "title": "Gov. Shapiro signs 2024-25 Pennsylvania budget, calls it a ‘major victory’",
    "text": "By Peter Hall ,\n8 hours ago Gov. Josh Shapiro signed into law a bipartisan budget for fiscal year 2024-25 on Thursday, July 11, 2024. (Commonwealth Media Services photo)\nGov. Josh Shapiro signed a $47.6 billion budget package on Thursday that represents a 6.2% increase in spending and provides more money for public schools, students attending state colleges and human services.\nThe spending plan, which is about $700 million less than Shapiro’s March budget proposal , nonetheless includes funding for several of his marquee initiatives. They include hundreds of millions for a strategic economic plan and a funding increase for public transit.\n“This budget is a major victory for the people we were all elected to serve,” Shapiro said in remarks before signing the budget. “I spent a lot of time outside this building in Pennsylvanian’s neighborhoods and towns, listening to them … folks basically want the same four things.”\nShapiro said the budget answers their desire for good schools, safe communities, economic opportunity, and personal freedom. It provides:\nA total of $11 billion in K-12 education funding; More money for public safety including $1.2 billion for state police allowing the agency to hire 400 new troopers for the second year in a row; Investments in main streets, tourism, agriculture, and $500 million to develop shovel-ready industrial sites for new businesses; and Tax cuts for senior citizens, tax credits to help families pay for childcare and interest on student loans, and new funding to end a waiting list for support professionals for the intellectually disabled and autism community. “We have proven that we can make progress. We can bring people together to solve big problems,” Shapiro said. “No one in the room got everything that they wanted. And there are some things we didn’t get done this time. We’re all going to come back and fight for next time.”\nIn that category are Shapiro’s proposals to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use and to regulate and tax skill games. Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) was critical of Shapiro for not following through on a taxpayer funded private school tuition voucher program for students in the state’s lowest performing school districts.\nThe budget increases funding for a similar program that provides tax credits for individuals and companies that contribute to private school scholarship funds by $75 million.\n“I am disappointed that we weren’t able to get something done for the children that are trapped in failing schools. … I want to go back at some point and fight for this program that the governor said he supports, but had no interest in pursuing at all this time around,” Ward said Thursday after the Senate finished voting.\nSenate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) praised Shapiro for continuing a reduction in the corporate net income tax to make Pennsylvania more attractive to businesses. Shapiro noted the budget also expands the ability for businesses to deduct operating losses from their tax liability to encourage startups to locate in the commonwealth.\nThe centerpiece of the budget is a response to the 2023 court order that declared the state’s school funding system unconstitutional . In a compromise between Senate Republicans and House Democrats, the budget will provide about $526 million to correct inequities in public education as part of more than $1.1 billion in new funding for school districts.\nHere’s some of what’s in the bill that directs historic new Pa. education funding\nAlthough the package is smaller than a version of the plan passed in the House last month, Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) called it a historic downpayment on the gap between the commonwealth’s wealthiest and poorer school districts.\n“We’re glad to see that the money is going to the districts that needed the most in accordance, in our view, with what the Commonwealth Court ruling said we should be doing,” Harris told reporters Thursday evening as the House and Senate held votes.\nHouse Speaker Joanna McClinton said the budget also provides for many Democratic priorities beyond education.\n“It delivers for our communities by investing in proven public safety initiatives and by providing tools to law enforcement to keep our streets safe. And it delivers for working families by helping them stay in their homes, afford childcare, and access the health care they need,” McClinton said.\nThe budget consists of more than a dozen pieces of legislation that provide instructions on how state agencies are to spend the money allocated to them in the general appropriations bill.\nThe appropriations bill, Senate Bill 1001, passed the House in a 120-80 vote, with all opposing votes cast by Republicans. The Senate concurred in House amendments to the bill in a 44-5 vote.\nRep. Seth Grove (R-York), who is the ranking GOP member of the Appropriations Committee, urged no votes on the appropriations bill, noting that since Shapiro took office, the state’s budget surplus has been reduced by nearly $5 billion.\n“What will he have gotten for it? Has state government changed all that much? Do constituents tell you, thanks for spending more money? Does it really improve government service? I don’t get those calls, and I doubt this budget will change much of anything,” Grove said.\nGrove has warned that depleting the surplus contributes to a structural deficit by spending money that is not certain to be replaced with new revenue.\n“The surplus will be gone next year, and this body will be looking for billions of dollars in new revenue. So citizens of Pennsylvania, the tax man is coming for your wallets. You can guarantee that,” he said.\nHarris countered that the state budget is a “moral document,” not just dollars and cents, but a statement of values.\n“You should vote for this budget for the educational spending that is in it, because at the end of the day, if our children can’t read or write or do math, it is not necessarily their fault,” Harris said. “It is the failure of the body to provide the resources that they need.”\nEducation funding was the central sticking point during budget negotiations, which lasted 11 days beyond the end of the fiscal year, when the state Constitution says a new budget should be in place.\nLawmakers have been working for nearly a year to craft an answer to Commonwealth Court President Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer’s order directing Shapiro and the Legislature put in place a system that corrects inequities created by the state’s reliance on property taxes to pay for public schools\nRep. Mike Sturla (D-Lancaster) was chairperson of the bipartisan commission that recommended the package to establish funding parity, provide relief to overburdened taxpayers and set a new funding baseline for all 500 school districts.\nAlthough the new budget provides less equity funding, Sturla said he is satisfied with the compromise.\n“It’s not heaven, but it’s not hell,” Sturla said, adding in an interview that “there is far more good than bad.”\nHowever, Sturla is unhappy with the data on poverty rates that will be used to distribute those funds. Instead of using numbers derived by the state Education Department from public benefit enrollment data, the budget directs the state to use U.S. Census data to determine poverty levels in individual school districts. Sturla believes that the census data will be less accurate.\n“The census numbers historically underreport poor people,” Sturla said.\nThe court decision was the outcome of nearly a decade of litigation on behalf of six school districts and the parents of children that attended those schools. The Education Law Center and the Public Interest Law Center, which represented the plaintiffs, praised lawmakers on Thursday for admitting that inequities exist while saying they had understated the problem.\n“Even though legislators artificially reduced the size of the state’s funding shortfall by undercounting students in poverty, at least now there is bipartisan agreement that adequately funded education requires, at minimum, an additional $4.5 billion, distributed to the communities that need it most,” the organizations said in a statement.\nThe Basic Education Funding Commission put the state’s share of the funding shortfall at $5.1 billion. Harris told reporters Thursday night that the $426 million in the budget will “come off the top” of that sum and that the Legislature will provide additional installments in future budgets.\nAlthough the education funding plan passed as part of the budget does not specify a timeline, Harris said lawmakers intend to stick to their plan to pay the full amount over the next seven years.\nThe House plan passed last month also called for reforming funding for cyber charter schools by setting a statewide tuition rate. School districts are currently required to pay cyber charter schools the same tuition they pay to brick-and-mortar charter schools, which advocates say results in massive overpayments beyond the actual cost of providing virtual education.\nUnder the compromise passed Thursday, the budget provides $100 million to reimburse school districts for cyber charter tuition. It also includes restrictions on advertising by requiring a disclaimer that charter schools are funded by taxpayers.\nSturla also took issue with a new mandate for each school district to hire security, money he said could have been better spent on education programs in struggling schools.\n“There’s only one mandate that’s in the constitution,” Sturla said. “If I don’t pave another road, if I don’t give another tax break, if I don’t do something for a corporation … If I don’t do any of that stuff, no one can take me to court and say I’m in violation of the constitution. The only thing someone can take me to court for — and by the way somebody did — is not funding education in an adequate and equitable manner.”\nThe budget also includes a slate of higher education reform bills to expand scholarships for students in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and to establish a state Board of Higher Education and a council to develop system performance measures to allocate state-related university funding.\nThe state-related universities, so-called because of the state’s limited oversight, will receive $500 million in the budget.\nRep. Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said the performance-based funding would provide confidence for lawmakers in funding the schools.\n“These are flagship universities in the Commonwealth that bring students here from all over the world. But that’s just what we hear. We need to see that reflected if we’re going to continue to support tuition through tax dollars. We need to see what exactly that is,” Topper said.\nDONATE: SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST\nThe post Gov.
