    "text": "23 agosto 2024 a a a Non si ferma l'offensiva ucraina in territorio russo. Le forze ucraine hanno colpito una base di truppe russe nella regione russa di Kursk utilizzando bombe di precisione plananti di fabbricazione statunitense, secondo quanto rivendica il comandante dell'aeronautica militare di Kiev, Mykola Oleshchuk , citato dal Kyiv Independent.\nLa base, ha detto, è stata colpita in serata con bombe Gbu-39. Intanto gli Stati Uniti ritengono che l'Ucraina abbia diritto al contrattacco nella guerra con la Russia: lo afferma il Pentagono, evitando però di entrare in una valutazione specifica di quanto sta accadendo nella regione di Kursk.\nAlla domanda se gli Usa sostengano l'incursione delle forze di Kiev in territorio russo, la viceportavoce Sabrina Singh ha affermato ieri sera in conferenza stampa che la politica del Pentagono è di \"consentire\" all'Ucraina di \"impegnarsi in tali contrattacchi\" ma che la difesa americana sta ancora cercando di \"comprendere meglio cosa sta facendo\" Kiev nel Kursk e come la volontà del presidente Volodymyr Zelensky di \"creare una zona cuscinetto si adatti agli obiettivi strategici\" ucraini. E l'esercito di Kiev ha messo a segno un colpo pesante. Un missile Neptune ucraino ha affondato una nave russa, la Conroe Trader, a bordo della quale viaggiavano 30 vagoni serbatoio colmi di greggio. Era nel porto di Kavkaz, nello stretto di Kerch che separa la Crimea dalla Russia, all’imbocco del mar d’Azov.",

    "text": "Ukraine’s Military Faces Major Shake-up Valery Zaluzhny, the general credited with many of Ukraine’s battlefield successes, is likely headed for the exits. Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep! Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep! For your radar: Jack and Robbie will be in Munich later this month with dozens of top world leaders and hundreds of senior national security officials from around the world for the Munich Security Conference. We’ll be sending out daily SitRep newsletters to round up all the news, scoops, and tidbits we’ll pick up along the way, so stay tuned for that. And if you or a colleague will be in Munich, send us an email or forward this one along. Alright, here’s what’s on tap for the day: Ukraine’s top general finds himself on thin ice, Biden greenlights retaliatory strikes against Iran in Iraq and Syria, and the United States moves ahead with selling pricey drones to India. Change of Course While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is still denying it, the country’s top general, Valery Zaluzhny, seems set to be [dismissed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/30/the-feud-between-ukraines-president-and-army-chief-boils-over) any day now. CNN [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/europe/zaluzhny-oust-ukraine-army-zelensky-intl/index.html#:~:text=Ukraine's%20popular%20army%20chief%20Valery,Zelensky%20and%20his%20top%20commander.) that the firing could happen as soon as this week. “The lack of success in the 2023 counter-offensive, the interview by General Zaluzhniy in The Economist in late 2023, and perceptions about his presidential aspirations all appear to have built to a crescendo in the past few days,” [tweeted](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1752482931866824807) Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general who recently traveled to Kyiv. Long-simmering tensions. Disagreements between Zaluzhny and the country’s political leaders occurred even before the war, with Zaluzhny trying to prepare Ukraine for the fight he believed was coming, while Ukrainian leaders, including Zelensky, downplayed the threat of Russia actually launching a full-scale invasion. And although in 2022 Zaluzhny mastered the military art of trading space for time by temporarily ceding territory in Ukraine’s east, the Ukrainian military got bogged down in the mineral-rich city of Bakhmut in 2023, [diverting](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/us/politics/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war.html) precious troops and resources away from the critical southern leg of the counteroffensive. Now, the Washington Post [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/31/zelensky-zaluzhny-ukraine-commander-ousted/) that Zaluzhny’s protests that Ukraine can’t reclaim more Russian-occupied territory without a fresh mobilization of troops and more weapons has further strained his relationship with Zelesnky. “We must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by the enemy in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures,” Zaluzhny wrote in an op-ed [published](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/opinions/ukraine-army-chief-war-strategy-russia-valerii-zaluzhnyi/index.html) by CNN on Thursday. Beyond the tactical tensions, there are also personal ones. [Experts](https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/91182) who traveled to Kyiv said that the friction between the two men was palpable, especially as Zaluzhny’s name was repeatedly bandied about in the press, even making Time magazine’s [list](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177692/valeriy-zaluzhnyy/) of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2022. “The general also showed political talent that he tried not to advertise,” researcher Konstantin Skorkin [wrote](https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/91182) for the Carnegie Endowment in December. “He managed to establish contacts with paramilitary and nationalist circles that were distrustful of Zelensky.” A November interview Zaluzhny gave to the Economist further [inflamed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia) tensions, after Zaluzhny publicly acknowledged the war was at a stalemate. Generational shift. Zelensky’s decision to promote Zaluzhny from a two-star post all the way to the top of Ukraine’s military in 2021 was seen as a major break with Ukraine’s Soviet past, as Foreign Policy previously [reported](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/01/how-ukraine-learned-to-fight/). Zaluzhny is part of a new generation of thinkers who came up after the fall of the Berlin Wall—he is the first Ukrainian military chief since independence never to have served in the Soviet Red Army—and who had bought into NATO’s “Mission Command”-style tactics that give individual troops greater flexibility to make tactical decisions in the heat of battle without having to ask headquarters first. Now, there is concern that Ukraine could reverse course on those tactics if Zaluzhny is fired. Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, one of Zaluzhny’s possible replacements, is eight years older than Zaluzhny. He’s a [graduate](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/08/who-is-oleksandr-syrsky-the-head-of-ukraines-ground-forces) of the Soviet equivalent of West Point and is hated by some of the rank and file of Ukraine’s military, as the Washington Post reported, who see him committed to operations like Bakhmut that focus on holding tactically unimportant territory instead of pushing to cut Russia’s access points out of Crimea. Another name that has been floated is Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s defense intelligence chief, who made [headlines](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/europe/budanov-ukraine-russia-war-intl/index.html) this week by downplaying the potential impact of another Trump term on Ukraine. Budanov has limited command experience but has taken credit for major sabotage missions [such as](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/04/21/7398888/) Ukrainian attacks on the Kerch Strait bridge in Crimea. Glimmers of hope. Projections for the year ahead in Ukraine are gloomy, as last year’s counteroffensive failed to reclaim significant ground and U.S. military aid remains in limbo in Congress. It’s not all bad news from Ukraine, though. “It’s important that we recognize the ways in which actually Ukraine has been having a great deal of success,” said a senior British official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the latest developments in the war. They pointed to what they described as “genuine lasting strategic change” in the Black Sea, noting that Ukraine has succeeded in establishing control over the western half of the sea, ousting much of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet from around Crimea. They added that Ukraine’s grain exports, which were brought to a near standstill by a Russian blockade that sent food prices soaring in much of the world, are projected to reach 80 percent of pre-invasion levels this year.

On the Button What should be high on your radar, if it isn’t already. Response incoming. U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a series of strikes on targets in Iraq and Syria, including Iranian personnel and facilities, [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-personnel-facilities-in-iraq-syria-approved-jordan-drone-attack/) reported on Thursday. The expected action is in response to a drone attack on a U.S. military outpost in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members and injured 41 on Sunday, which the Biden administration has [attributed](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2024/01/31/kirby-says-islamic-resistance-iraq-responsible-for-deadly-attack/8501706733258/) to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella term for a network of Iranian-backed militia groups. U.S. forces across the region have faced a barrage of rocket and drone attacks by Iranian proxies since war between Israel and Hamas began in October. Drones for New Delhi. The State Department has approved the possible sale of 31 MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones, produced by General Atomics, to India, as part of an arms package estimated to cost almost $4 billion. The proposed deal was first [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/22/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-india/) during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington last year and underscores the deepening defense ties between the United States and India. Washington has sought to bolster India’s defense capabilities to serve as a counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific. “The proposed sale will improve India’s capability to meet current and future threats by enabling unmanned surveillance and reconnaissance patrols in sea lanes of operation,” the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency [said](https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/india-mq-9b-remotely-piloted-aircraft) in a statement announcing the deal, which will now go to Congress for final approval. Spies like us. Members of Generation Z are entering the workforce in droves with new expectations about work-life balance that are causing another culture shock for organizations that were barely getting over the millennial influx.

They are tech savvy,” he writes of the new Gen Z cohort of operations officers. But that’s not all. “At this rate, according to my peers, one would not be surprised if the young officers unionized, with work stoppages and demands for better working conditions becoming more important than stealing secrets and penetrating terrorist networks.” Snapshot Put on Your Radar Thursday, Feb. 1: Adm.

    "text": "Bogotá (EFE).- El científico colombiano Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, descubridor de la primera vacuna sintética contra la malaria, falleció este jueves en su casa en Bogotá, confirmaron a EFE fuentes familiares.\nPatarroyo, de 78 años y ganador del Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica de 1994, sufría quebrantos de salud y «esta mañana murió en su casa», al parecer de un paro cardiorrespiratorio, según uno de sus familiares.\nEl científico, nacido el 3 de noviembre de 1946 en la localidad de Ataco, en el departamento del Tolima, era médico de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, institución a la que estuvo vinculado durante toda su carrera como investigador científico.\n«Hoy ha partido un gran científico colombiano: Manuel Elkin Patarroyo. Su legado está representado, más que en la primera vacuna sintética del mundo, en una generación de investigadores a quienes inculcó el valor de construir país, generando conocimiento. ¡GRACIAS!», escribió en su cuenta de X la decana de Ciencias de la Universidad Nacional, Gabriela Delgado.\nFotografía de archivo del inmunólogo colombiano y padre de la vacuna de la malaria Manuel Elkin Patarroyo. EFE/Ángel Medina G. Continuo perfeccionamiento de su vacuna Patarroyo descubrió en 1987 la primera vacuna sintética contra la malaria, con un rango de protección del 40 %, que donó a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) con el fin de que fuera de distribución gratuita como un regalo a la humanidad.\nDespués de ese descubrimiento, Patarroyo dedicó años de trabajo en la Fundación Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia (Fidic), de la cual fue director, a perfeccionar la vacuna y a ampliar su rango de protección, así como a desarrollar una fórmula madre para diferentes vacunas.\nLa Universidad Nacional recordó hoy que Patarroyo obtuvo su título de médico cirujano en esa institución en 1971 y al año siguiente «se vinculó como profesor ejerciendo hasta la fecha».\n«En su larga trayectoria docente e investigativa obtuvo múltiples reconocimientos y distinciones», agregó la Universidad Nacional en un comunicado.\nAdemás del Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica, Patarroyo fue galardonado, también en 1994, con el Premio Robert Koch, el más prestigioso galardón científico de Alemania, y con el Premio León Bernard, de la OMS, entre otros reconocimientos a su obra.",

    "text": "Desde su lanzamiento a mediados de 2023, Diablo 4 ha oscilado entre polémicas y los elogios de su comunidad. Con su fórmula de juego como servicio, Blizzard ha intentado evolucionar su ARPG al equilibriar las demandas de los jugadores con el paso de las temporadas. Ahora, con la Temporada 8 ya en marcha y la colaboración con Berserk y Diablo 4 a la vuelta de la esquina, el título se ha envuelto en otra polémica que está relacionado con su Pase de Batalla.\nEl Pase de Batalla de Diablo 4 ha cambiado\nBlizzard ha decidido dar un giro radical al Pase de Batalla de Diablo 4 con la Temporada 8: El Regreso de Belial. Este nuevo sistema divide las recompensas en relicarios separados (armas, monturas, etc.) que pueden comprarse individualmente por menos de 10 euros o en un paquete completo al precio habitual. Aunque la idea de elegir premios en cualquier orden suena bien, la comunidad ha detectado un problema: hay menos contenido de lo habitual.\nEste Pase de Batalla, dividido en relicarios, ofrece menos cosméticos (no hay emotes, lápidas ni títulos) y, lo más polémico, solo te da 200 de Platino (la moneda premium). La comunidad ha protestado porque en las temporadas pasadas Blizzard ofrecía 700 monedas de platino en Diablo 4 al completar todos los niveles. Esto significa que los jugadores ya no podrán reciclar parte del coste para aprovecharlo en la siguiente temporada, tendrán que pagar dinero de nuevo.\nEn este sentido, el descontento de los jugadores se ha reflejado en el subreddit de Diablo 4, donde se ha comparado el antiguo pase con el nuevo sistema, mostrando una reducción del 71% en la moneda premium y la eliminación de categoría enteras de recompensas. El usuario ITheDarkitect lamenta la decisión de Blizzard y señala lo siguiente: \"La masiva rebaja, especialmente de 500 monedas de platino, y la supuesta 'libertad de acción' que pretende hacerlo mejor, no me sorprenden en absoluto. Gastaré mi dinero en otra cosa\", apoyado de miles de votos.\nVía | Windows Central\nEn 3DJuegos | Guía Diablo 4 con TODOS los trucos, secretos, coleccionables, trofeos y misiones secundarias para completar el juego al 100%\nEn 3DJuegos | Los fans de Diablo 4 piden a gritos el Paladín y Blizzard ha respondido con una promesa que eleva las expectativas. \"Todo el mundo estará contento\"",

    "title": "Boeing Union Members Begin Strike; Stock Drops",
    "text": "Boeing Co.'s about 33,000 machinists union members have started a strike on Friday after majority of them voted to reject a proposed four-year contract by the aerospace and defence major. The first strike at the firm since 2008 is expected to hit the commercial airplane production of the aircraft manufacturer, which is already struggling with its various plane safety issues. In pre-market activity on the NYSE, Boeing shares were losing around 4 percent to trade at $156.23. The work stoppages by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers or IAM, who build commercial planes, happen in airplane assembly at Boeing's factories in the Seattle area as well as in Portland, Oregon and in southern California. Boeing, after months of negotiations, had reached a tentative agreement on September 8 with IAM Districts 751 & W24, which represent more than 33,000 Boeing employees. The agreement included a 25 percent raise over four years, along with improvements to health-care costs and retirement benefits, as well as increased job security for union members. The agreement also included a commitment to build the next new airplane at one of the union-represented plants in the Puget Sound region. Boeing said if the tentative agreement was ratified by September 12, employees would receive a one-time $3,000 lump sum payment. The previous agreement was set to expire at midnight on September 12. After reaching the agreement with Boeing, IAM 751 Union president Jon Holden had written that the union recommended acceptance of the deal, because they couldn't guarantee of achieving more in a strike. But, soon after, the union members, who had been advocating for raises of more than 40 percent, started complaining that the proposal was not good enough, and rejected the deal recommended by union leaders. The members also voted to go on strike. Around 95 percent of members of the IAM union voted against the deal, and around 96 percent voted to authorize a strike, which began in the midnight. In a statement on IAM District 751 and W24's rejection of the tentative agreement with Boeing, the union stated that the negotiating teams from District 751 and W24 will now regroup and plan the next steps on securing an agreement that their membership can approve. Further, in an update on the union's contract vote, Boeing said, \"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\" Boeing, in its website, commented that a strike would hurt local businesses of all sizes, from aerospace suppliers to restaurants and retailers, and could lead to economic disruptions across the state of Washington as well as in the Portland area. The latest strike by the union members is a major hit to the plane maker, which has been under severe scrutiny for the past few years amid safety concerns. In mid August, the company paused flight tests for its new 777X jetliner and grounded the four-aircraft test fleet after finding damage in a plane's structure. In April, the FAA announced an investigation into the emergency landing by Southwest Airlines' Boeing 737-800 flight after its engine cover fell off and struck the wing flap during take-off. Earlier, in January, a mid-cabin door plug on Alaska Airlines' Boeing 737-9 MAX airplane blew out in the middle of the flight, following which FAA grounded around 171 737 MAX 9 airplanes for inspections for several weeks. In March 2019, 737 MAX, which was then the world's biggest-selling aircraft, was grounded worldwide following two crashes within just six months, which together claimed 346 lives.

Across the Atlantic, remarks from the Bank of England Chief were in focus. Some of the main economic data released during the week included the results of the purchasing managers’ survey for different economies and labor market data from the U.S.",

    "text": "Última hora en elEconomista.es15\nLlega fin de mes y, con ello, la nómina para miles de trabajadores, documento en el que, además del salario, aparece otra multitud de conceptos que a veces son difíciles de entender para el ciudadano de a pie. Al no estar al tanto de estos términos es probable que, en caso de haber un error, no sepamos identificarlo y acabemos cobrando de menos.\nA pesar de que la ley obliga a las empresas a seguir un patrón común en sus nóminas, modelo que viene regulado en la Orden ESS/2098/2014, es cierto que el diseño entre unas y otras puede variar, aunque los conceptos van a seguir siendo los mismos, por lo que entendida una, entendidas todas.\nLa importancia de conocer el convenio\nAhora bien, primero hay que asimilar las palabras más importantes: salario base, devengos y complementos salariales son los parámetros fundamentales para entender nuestra nómina.\nDe entrada, lo que más importa es saber qué convenio colectivo se nos aplica, un acuerdo formal entre trabajadores y empresas que regula las condiciones laborales de los primeros y en el que aparece el salario base, los complementos salariales y todo lo que deberíamos cobrar.\nEstar al tanto de nuestro convenio es bastante fácil. Basta con ir a la cláusula 7 de nuestro contrato de trabajo y ahí debería aparecer \"y lo puedes buscar en Google\", señala Ignacio de la Calzada, abogado laboralista, en un vídeo publicado en su perfil de TikTok. Cuando lo tengamos, solo hay que ir a las tablas salariales que aparecen en el documento para ver qué salario base nos corresponde por convenio, o lo que es lo mismo, \"el mínimo que nos corresponde\".\nAhora vamos con los complementos salariales, pluses en los que se incluyen la antigüedad, peligrosidad, toxicidad, etc. \"Todos los complementos deben aparecer en el convenio y si no están es que no existen\", aclara de la Calzada. Asimismo, el abogado explica que es aquí donde deberían aparecer las pagas extra, que pueden ser dos, tres o cuatro, según lo establezca el convenio.\n[@laboral_tips]? ¿Sabes leer tu nómina? Te lo explico en 60 segundos\" ? Atención trabajadores: Si cada mes miras tu nómina y no entiendes nada, este video es para ti. ? ? Lo que necesitas revisar SÍ o SÍ: ? Salario base: Es lo mínimo que debes cobrar según tu convenio. ? Complementos salariales: Antigüedad, nocturnidad, peligrosidad… ¡Aquí pueden faltarte euros! ? ? Deducciones: Seguridad Social e IRPF. Cuanto más IRPF te retienen, más podrías recuperar en la renta. ? Líquido a percibir: Lo que realmente llega a tu cuenta. ¡Que no te engañen! ? Truco: Si dudas de tu sueldo, compara tu convenio colectivo y revisa que no falte nada. ? ¿Quieres que te ayude a revisar tu nómina? Déjame un comentario o escríbeme. ¡Que no te quiten lo que es tuyo! ?[#nomina][#sueldo][#trabajo][#derechos][#abogado][#laboral][? sonido original - Un Tío Legal]\nEs habitual que \"se equivoquen o engañen\"\nEl salario base más los complementos son los devengos, o lo que es lo mismo, nuestro salario bruto. Después, pasamos a las deducciones: lo que nos van a restar de Seguridad Social (contingencias comunes, formación profesional, desempleo) y el IRPF. \"No se puede elegir un tramo inferior al que te corresponde, como mucho puedes pedir que te retengan más\", recuerda el experto.\nA los devengos se les restan las deducciones y es entonces cuando aparece el salario neto, lo que cobramos tras impuestos y recibimos en nuestra cuenta bancaria cada mes.\nSin embargo, es posible que las empresas \"se equivoquen o engañen\" al trabajador, por ejemplo, obviando los complementos salariales. De ahí la importancia de revisar el convenio, incluso podríamos reclamar horas extras que no aparezcan en la nómina como tal.",

    "text": "Los estudiantes del máster en Ingeniería del Motorsport vivieron la emoción del Gran Premio GoPro de Aragón de MotoGP\nLos alumnos recibieron una masterclass sobre el papel del hidrógeno como combustible del futuro y visitaron las instalaciones de TechnoparkEl éxito de Marc Márquez tras su primera victoria desde el pasado año con Ducati y de nuevo en el trazado español fue un momento culminante que los estudiantes del máster en Ingeniería del Motorsport pudieron vivir en primera fila, observando el impacto del trabajo en equipo y la estrategia en tiempo real. Los alumnos no solo fueron espectadores, sino que también participaron en actividades técnicas exprimiendo al máximo el paddock de MotorLand Aragón, comprendiendo mejor cómo aplicar sus conocimientos en situaciones de alta presión, como las demás sesiones que se llevaron a cabo durante el evento.\nDe la mano de Marcos Rupérez Cerqueda, ingeniero zaragozano y uno de los pioneros en lograr el primer vehículo eléctrico que compitió en el Dakar Rally, los alumnos recibieron una masterclass sobre el papel del hidrógeno como combustible del futuro y el impacto que tendría en la transición hacia una variante del motorsport más sostenible, ha informado Motorland en una nota de prensa. Además pudieron conocer el proceso de cómo se llevó a cabo el proyecto dakariano para conseguir el logro, que no solo representa un avance tecnológico impresionante, sino también un paso crucial hacia un futuro en el que la alta competición y el respeto por el medio ambiente van de la mano.\nAdemás, el programa incluyó una visita a las instalaciones de Technopark MotorLand, donde conocieron la actividad de empresas e instituciones punteras como el Instituto de Investigación en Ingeniería de Aragón (I3A) de la Universidad de Zaragoza, cuyo laboratorio de seguridad vial es uno de los pocos en el mundo dedicados a esta especialidad y desarrolla proyectos innovadores como BioAdvance.\nLa importancia de la psicología deportiva y la neurociencia en la competición\nEl éxito en la competición no depende solo de la tecnología y la mecánica, sino también de la mente y el liderazgo. De esta manera en la sesión presencial de la asignatura Psicología deportiva y Coaching, se mostró cómo la neurociencia puede llegar a ser una herramienta poderosa para mejorar la comunicación y la cohesión dentro de un equipo de trabajo abarcando mecánicos, técnicos y pilotos.\nDe la teoría en el campus de SEAS, Estudios Abiertos a la práctica, y desde el inicio del proceso hasta la introducción de las piezas en autoclave. Los estudiantes han experimentado de primera mano en la empresa Magma Composites el meticuloso trabajo que requiere la producción de componentes de fibra de carbono. Una formación práctica entre Managing Composites y el Máster en Ingeniería del Motorsport es esencial para que los estudiantes comprendan la precisión y dedicación que exige trabajar con materiales compuestos en la industria del Motorsport.\nGracias a la colaboración de estructuras como Aprilia Racing, Pertamina Enduro VR46 Racing Team y Honda HRC Castrol, los alumnos pudieron conocer de primera mano el complejo engranaje que da vida a un equipo de la categoría reina. Las visitas ofrecieron una visión integral de la organización interna, la gestión operativa y los aspectos técnicos que rodean la preparación de una moto de competición.\nDurante la jornada, los estudiantes apreciaron de cerca máquinas como la Aprilia RS-GP25 de Marco Bezzecchi, las Ducati Desmosedici GP de Fabio Di Giannantonio y Franco Morbidelli, y la Honda RC213V pilotada por Joan Mir. Todo ello acompañado de explicaciones técnicas sobre el trabajo de ingenieros y mecánicos, tanto en equipos oficiales como satélite.\nEl trabajo en equipo que se respira en el ambiente y el aprendizaje en un entorno real como ocurre en las sesiones prácticas organizadas a lo largo del curso en el circuito, permiten observar de cerca el nivel de preparación, precisión y coordinación que exige una competición de este calibre.\nInscripciones abiertas\nLas inscripciones para la sexta edición del máster en Ingeniería del Motorsport, que comenzará en enero de 2026, ya están abiertas.\nUna formación única en España, desarrollada por MotorLand Aragón, SEAS Estudios Abiertos y la Universidad San Jorge, diseñada para aquellos ingenieros que sueñan con formar parte del mundo del automovilismo y motociclismo profesional.\nA lo largo del curso, los alumnos vivirán una experiencia 100% inmersiva, con profesores en activo en las grandes competiciones como MotoGP o Formula 1, acceso exclusivo a eventos reales, formación en pista, contacto directo con equipos de élite y profesionales del sector.\nLas plazas son limitadas, se recomienda reservar lo antes posible. Una vez completadas, se activará la lista de espera en orden de inscripción hasta el inicio de la nueva edición para la temporada 2026 de Motorland Aragón.",
