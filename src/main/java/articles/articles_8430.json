    "text": "近日，浙江温州乐清市人民医院微信公众号发布了一起死亡病例，一名老人在家处理青蟹时，不慎被其腿刺伤左手，经过9天时间抢救，仍不幸离世。\n文章称，该老人的左手被蝤蛑（记者注：即青蟹）刺伤后，本以为只是小伤，贴上创可贴了事。之后，手部伤口有些肿胀，但老人也没有及时到医院就诊。在刺伤23小时后，第二天一大早，老人的左手臂出现明显红肿热痛，并伴有头晕乏力症状，遂被家人送往乐清市人民医院急诊。急诊验血显示：肌酐 179.30μmol，医生考虑为“脓毒性休克创伤弧菌感染和急性肾衰竭”，并因病情随时可能变化，立即将患者收住重症医学科治疗。\n入住重症医学科后，老人的呼吸费力，胸闷，左上肢疼痛明显，评估疼痛NRS评分3分，医生用敏感双联抗生素、机械通气等对症支持治疗。入科1小时，老人的上肢伤情进展迅猛，出现了坏死性筋膜炎，手外科急诊行“筋膜皮瓣移植术+软组织病损切除术+筋膜间隙切开减压术”，不曾想局部清创效果不佳，老人的左上肢继续恶化并出现了肾衰表现，医生当机立断为其行左上肢截肢术，术后又进行血液透析治疗。遗憾的是，经过9天时间的抢救，老人还是不幸离世。\n澎湃新闻检索了解到，青蟹在温州当地被习惯称为蝤蛑，它栖息于温暖而盐度较低的浅海，体呈椭圆形，青绿色，头胸甲短而宽，肉质细嫩腴美，是当地老百姓喜闻乐见的美食。\n乐清市人民医院在文章中提醒，创伤弧菌广泛存在于近海海底、海底淤泥和海产品中，分布极广，富含蛋白质的牡蛎、毛蚶、贻贝均可能出现，对虾的污染率和污染水平较高，海鱼中该菌的污染水平较低，在淡水鱼虾中较少见。创伤弧菌感染后，临床上最常见的两种表现：伤口感染和脓毒血症，48小时内死亡率会达到50%以上；如果超过72小时未接受有效治疗，则感染的死亡率将会趋近100%。\n医生提醒，在处理海鲜时一定要佩戴防护手套，若不小心受伤后一定要彻底消毒，如果不慎受伤并出现疑似症状，请立即就医。创伤弧菌具有嗜盐性，切勿使用生理盐水或将盐撒到伤口上，以免加重感染。",

    "title": "Cook Islands: Mangaia residents turn to land and sea amidst shipping delays",
    "text": "The residents of a Southern Group Island continue to endure ongoing hardships due to inconsistent shipping, driving up costs and forcing reliance on subsistence living, while awaiting government-promised shipping improvements.\nMangaia’s executive officer Mia Teaurima says the island’s ongoing struggles with delayed shipping and high living costs are a reality that residents have become accustomed to, despite the challenges it brings.\nShipping delays are nothing new for the Pa Enua, with residents often seeing empty shelves in shops for weeks, sometimes months, due to inconsistent supply deliveries.\nThe difficult circumstances have encouraged Mangaia residents to turn to the land and sea to sustain themselves, demonstrating the resilience of the community.\n“In other words, it encourages people to resort to land and sea and that’s what’s happening,” Teaurima said.\n“We get two times for shipping, through Taio Shipping . Otherwise, to me, there’s always about two times of these domestic services coming around Mangaia every month and I think that’s normal for our island.”\nAccording to Teaurima, shipping to Mangaia has been delayed due to vessel repair issues.\nTaio Shipping’s co-director, Mona Taio, clarified that since January last year, they have been regularly servicing the Pa Enua, ensuring a minimum of one trip per month for every Southern Group Island, totalling to 12 confirmed trips per year and occasionally two trips per month “when possible”.\nHowever, extra trips to the Pa Enua were not possible because the private shipping service had not received a government subsidy since January of last year, which impacted their ability to service the Northern Group Islands.\nThis has forced Taio Shipping to resort to self-sufficient financing operations to prioritise consistent and reliable trips to the Southern Group Islands only.\n“Previously, when servicing both North and South, trips were longer and more delayed due to the extensive haul to the Northern Group,” Taio said.\n“By shifting our focus to the South, we have successfully maintained a regular and reliable monthly shipping schedule minimising delays and ensuring better service for the Southern Group islands.\n“With this regular shipping schedule in place, we believe there should be no major supply issues in the last 12 months. Taio Shipping remains committed to serving the Pa Enua to the best of our ability.”\nThe Cook Islands government has confirmed its plans to operate a domestic shipping service, a move intended to bring greater regularity and affordability to the Pa Enua’s supply chain.\nThis was recently confirmed by Prime Minister Mark Brown who provided an update on government’s plans to bring two cargo and passenger vessels from China and Japan to assist with such challenges.\nThe China vessel will be co-funded by the Cook Islands and China government. The Cook Islands government allocated $3 million (US$1.69) for its procurement in the supplementary budget passed last week. The other vessel is a donation from the Japanese government.\nIn Parliament last week, PM Brown, while responding to a question from the Cook Islands United Party leader, Teariki Heather, said: “Firstly, on the ship from China, I am not sure when this vessel will arrive. I will however ask the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management on the arrangements.”\n“Secondly, on the ship from Japan, what I know about this boat is that it is less than 10 years old, it is double propelled, and it is ideal to service the needs of the Pa Enua. Right now, the boat is undergoing modifications to expand the cargo holds. The cost of these modifications has been generously covered by the Government of Japan.”\nMangaia executive officer Teaurima noted that the government’s shipping fleet plan is still a work in progress.\n“With the Government’s plans to nationalise the shipping service, if that’s going to improve the current situation, then definitely,” he said.\n“It’s the government’s plan/strategy but it’s been an ongoing discussion and we’re hoping that it will materialise sooner than later.”\nThe lack of regular shipping not only affects access to goods but also drives up the already high cost of living on the island.\n“The cost of living is very high, very, very high,” Teaurima said. “And of course, the Pa Enua I suppose, is getting used to getting those costs at the end of the day but the government is doing their best to help out people in the Pa Enua.”\nTeaurima acknowledged government initiatives such as tax relief measures aimed at providing extra income for residents. Since April 2023, residents of the Pa Enua have not had to pay income tax unless they earn over $60,000 (US$33,9850 a year.\nHowever, Teaurima said the community still faces numerous challenges, from labour shortages and depopulation to a lack of heavy machinery and resources.\n“It’s hard life, but it’s not that it can’t be done,” he said.\nThe island’s administration is doing what it can to help, making government machinery available to support community projects and alleviate some of the burdens caused by resource shortages.\n“So, we’re making our machinery available to the communities to help out as much as we can.”\nWhile the government’s plans to nationalise shipping could offer a glimmer of hope, Teaurima remains realistic about the current situation.\n“I think the people in the Pa Enua are used to this life. I’m not saying that that’s good, but I’m saying that this is not new. It’s ongoing,” said Teaurima.",

    "title": "When Leaders Fall “They’re Only Human” Doesn’t Help Our Disillusionment",
    "text": "It seems like it is impossible to go through a month without hearing of another Christian leader and their misdemeanors. The phenomenon is interpreted differently. Some feel like Pastors are being victimized as believers post their judgements all over social media. Others would prefer to ignore it and avoid all discussions. But unfortunately some Christians have been trying their best to battle through the disillusionment that can often happen when people you trust are discovered to have\na secret life.\nSo what exactly is disillusionment? To be brief, it is the shock, confusion, emotional and/or psychological instability that arises when you realize that the world or aspects therein, don’t work the way you once believed it to. These beliefs that we put our trust in, aren’t necessarily doctrine. They are formulas we have derived through life experience, that we assume to be biblical. For example: “If I do Christian things like serve at church, regularly attend church, read my Bible, pray…I will avoid hard things”. Often it’s not until a challenging situation, that we discover we had these beliefs in the first place. But disillusionment can settle in, in the process of relearning such beliefs.\nFor any person who is genuinely struggling with the disillusionment that has arisen in relation to such leaders, it is inevitable at some point that you will hear the statement, “Well the fact is they’re only human”. The statement is meant to imply that leaders are only humans too, open to the same temptations and frailties that all humans are. For a disillusioned person the statement couldn’t be more frustrating. They know that the person is only human, but usually that’s not the problem upending your previously perfect worldview. Here are four reasons why this statement can be incredibly difficult for a disillusioned person to swallow:\nWhy “They’re Only Human” Doesn’t Help\n1. It can be dismissive\nFor the genuinely disillusioned person, they often can’t make sense of the mess in their head. All they have is a sense that something is not right, and no obvious way to organize that confusion. None of the confusion they are experiencing is intended to come across angry, or judgmental. They’re just doing the best they can to find psychological and emotional clarity, which is often buried underneath a massive mess of thoughts. Sometimes the reason we make a statement like this is because we feel some need to defend the leader. Maybe the disillusioned person is being too harsh or we can just sense that they have a really imbalanced view on the situation. And we may be right! Maybe we feel compassion for the leader…and that’s okay too. But if the cost of asserting our opinions equates to a dismissal of a believer’s very genuine and active process of internal reorganization, it probably isn’t worth it. At least not in that specific moment.",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEmpieza la respuesta judicial a la oleada de amenazas de la extrema derecha francesa contra los magistrados. El Tribunal de Bobigny (periferia norte de París) ... condenó este miércoles por la tarde a ocho meses de prisión condicional a un internauta, de 76 años, que había amenazado de muerte a la jueza que inhabilitó a Marine Le Pen hasta 2030. La pena para este jubilado, que no tenía antecedentes, incluye una multa de 3.000 euros.\nTras el anuncio del veredicto por el caso de los falsos asistentes en el Parlamento Europeo de la ultraderechista Agrupación Nacional (RN, por sus siglas en francés), Gérard B. publicó en la red social X la fotografía de una guillotina, acompañada por el mensaje «es lo que merece esta puta». Lo escribió refiriéndose a la jueza Bénédicte de Perthuis, que presidió la corte que declaró culpable a Le Pen de haber llevado a cabo «un sistema» que permitió a su partido malversar 4,5 millones del Parlamento Europeo. Además de una inhabilitación a efectos inmediatos de cinco años, la líder de la extrema derecha fue condenada a cuatro años de prisión (dos ellos condicionales) y una multa de 100.000 euros.\nEl mensaje por parte de ese simpatizante de la derecha radical solo fue visto por 200 personas en la red social de Elon Musk. A pesar de ello, lo detuvieron y lo procesaron a través de un juicio rápido. «En Francia, hay personas a las que cortaron la cabeza» tras haber sufrido una campaña de acoso en internet, ha recordado el fiscal. Lo ha dicho refiriéndose al caso del profesor Samuel Paty, asesinado en 2020 por un joven yihadista. «Detrás de su teléfono en su casa (…), uno no asume ningún riesgo. Pero eso puede ser un pretexto para personas violentas o con problemas mentales», ha añadido el representante del Ministerio Público.\nEl autor de esa amenaza de muerte es un francés 'pied-noir' que nació en la Argelia francesa y se fue a la Francia metropolitana cuando tenía 14 años, tras la independencia de ese país. Actualmente, está jubilado tras haber dirigido una empresa de informática. Durante el juicio, se defendió con que la foto de la guillotina «era un «símbolo de justicia. Lo que quería decir es que algunos jueces quizás merecerían ser juzgados». Tras la sentencia del 31 de marzo, se multiplicaron en internet los mensajes insultantes y amenazantes contra Bénédicte de Perthuis. Hasta el punto de que tuvieron que desplegar una protección policial específica para esta magistrada.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?
