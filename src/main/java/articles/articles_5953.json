Our Air Quality Advisory over Deschutes County is set to expire today and we’ll see good to moderate air quality, which is acceptable.\nWe had nice, crisp, near normal temperatures yesterday but a ridge of high pressure is building over our region again and will keep us above normal through the first half of next week.\nToday, we heat up a little from yesterday, back into the low and mid 70s. We’ll be under mostly cloudy skies again today but they’ll clear up tomorrow just in time for your weekend plans. Lows will be in the 30s and 40s. Tomorrow, we cool a degree or two into in the low 70s with sunny skies. Sunday and Monday we’ll heat up again, a few areas could reach those upper 70s.\nBy mid next week, temperatures drop quite a bit! We have a chance of seeing some rain Wednesday and some decent snow on our mountains the following day. Current models are showing a bit of a wintry mix even reaching us here on the eastern slopes. This is still a bit of a ways out, but it could be the “big weather event” that officially ends our fire season. Who’s ready for ski and snowboarding season to start already? We'll continue to track it for you here.\nHappy Friday, Have a fantastic weekend.

    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will reinforce its newly established permanent bases in northern Iraq in the coming months, after 12 Turkish soldiers were killed in the region, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday. The twelve were killed last week in northern Iraq in clashes with the militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) based there. \"In recent years, we have built hundreds of kilometres-long roads in northern Iraq for our permanent bases. We carry out the same activities in new places we have controlled,\" Erdogan told a televised meeting in Ankara. \"By the arrival of spring, we will have completed the infrastructure of our newly established bases (in northern Iraq), and make terrorists unable to set foot in the region.\" Turkish forces regularly carry out strikes in neighbouring Iraq as part of the country's offensive against PKK militants. Since 2019, Turkey has launched a series of operations in northern Iraq after Erdogan's declaration of \"a new security concept in combating terrorism\" and plan to \"neutralise terrorism and terrorists at source.\" The PKK, which demands greater Kurdish rights and has large fortifications around northern Iraq, is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. It took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and over the decades it has conducted many deadly attacks in Turkey. (Reporting by Huseyin Hayatsever; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

    "text": "Comme face à Aston Villa en Premier League fin août, le gardien d’Arsenal, David Raya, a réalisé un double arrêt de toute beauté face à l’Atalanta Bergame jeudi en Ligue des champions. L’Espagnol a notamment repoussé un penalty. C’est en passe de devenir une vraie spécialité. Sa \"spéciale\". Depuis le début de saison, David Raya montre qu’il est capable de réaliser des doubles arrêts aussi spectaculaires que décisifs. Ça avait été le cas fin août lors du match de Premier League entre Arsenal et Aston Villa . Le portier des Gunners a remis ça jeudi pour l’entrée en lice d’Arsenal en Ligue des champions sur la pelouse de l’Atalanta Bergame . Alors que le score était toujours de 0-0 en début de deuxième période, l’arbitre siffle un penalty en faveur des Italiens consécutif à un accrochage entre Partey et Ederson (48e).\nLes tuyaux du coach des gardiens d'Arsenal Alors que l’action, litigieuse, est checkée un long moment par le VAR, David Raya profite de l’arrêt de jeu pour aller consulter le coach des gardiens. Les deux hommes ont-ils échangé sur les choix préférentiels de Mateo Retegui en matière de penalty?\nC’est possible. En tout cas, le portier d’Arsenal ne se trompe pas de côté et repousse le tir de l’Italien. Le ballon revient plein axe sur le tireur qui pense pouvoir conclure de la tête. Erreur. Fort sur ses appuis et véloce, David Raya repousse une deuxième fois le ballon. Ecoeurant.\nABr Top Articles\nPSG-Gérone: l'incroyable occasion manquée par Dembélé",

    "text": "The weather is expected to remain misrerable throughout the week (Picture: PA)\nThe last few days of 2023 are set to be blighted by strong winds, rain and snow as the UK feels the aftermath of Storm Gerrit.\nAlthough the peak of Storm Gerrit has now passed, Thursday will continue to be blustery with showers, some heavy and more organised in parts. Friday continues this general theme with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions.\nThe move comes after a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester on Wednesday night that had a ‘strong rotating updraft’, which resulted in a ‘localised tornado’.\nAround 100 properties were damaged by the ‘tornado’ in Stalybridge, Tameside, and residents in the badly hit village of Carrbrook told of the states of ‘absolute disaster’ houses were in.\nHowever, the Met Office reported the ‘worst’ of Storm Gerrit has cleared away as of Thursday afternoon.\nMeteorologist Alex Burkill said the blustery and showery picture is expected to continue overnight and into Friday, with winds expected to ease slightly across most of the UK.\nA further bout of ‘very strong winds’ and a spell of ‘intense rain’ is expected on Saturday before more unsettled weather with ‘blustery, showery conditions likely as we go through New Year’s Eve’, the meteorologist added.\nMet Office Chief Forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: ‘Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit.’\nLooking further ahead into 2024, there is low forecast confidence. ‘Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely,’ said a Met Office spokesperson.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at [email protected] .\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more by signing up to Metro’s News Updates newsletter",

    "text": "Medellín (Colombia), 5 sep (EFE).- Después de vibrar al ritmo de la marea amarilla en Bogotá, la selección femenina Sub-20 de Colombia se mudó por unos días a Medellín para enfrentar a México y de paso remover recuerdos por la especial conexión que tiene esta ciudad con algunos miembros del equipo que buscará este viernes el primer lugar del Grupo A.\n\"Me llena de orgullo venir acá a la tierra que me vio nacer\", dijo a periodistas el entrenador sub-20 de Colombia, Carlos Paniagua, quien conoce muy bien el estadio Atanasio Girardot, el escenario en el que recibirán a las aztecas y donde hace cinco años disputó la liga colombiana femenina con Independiente Medellín antes cerca de 30.000 espectadores.\nEn esta ciudad, que acogió a Brasil, Francia, Canadá y Fiyi con los juegos del Grupo B, se agotó la boletería para ver a las cafeteras disputar \"el partido más importante porque nos define si pasamos de primeras\", dijo la delantera Karla Torres, de visión aterrizada sobre la Tricolor, al señalar que van \"paso a paso\" porque \"el día a día nos dará esa oportunidad de ser campeonas\".\nY para conseguirlo, el siguiente escollo será México, un seleccionado \"bueno y con buenas atacantes\", al que le \"gusta jugar\", por lo que esperan un película distinta a la vivida en la apretada victoria por 1-0 con Camerún, un rival \"muy físico\" al que dejaron atrás con el fervor de la afición.\n\"Estamos muy felices. No soñaba esto tan rápido. Quiero agradecerle a todas las personas por ese apoyo y por creer en el fútbol femenino\", comentó la atacante antes del entrenamiento en el Parque Estadio Sur, del municipio de Envigado.\nSu compañera Yunaira López, autora del primer gol de Colombia en la competición, también está con la energía arriba y en 'su salsa' al llegar a Medellín, donde ha crecido como futbolista profesional y actualmente desarrolla su carrera en el club Atlético Nacional junto a Mary José Álvarez y Katerine Osorio.\n\"Algunas tenemos a nuestras familias acá, somos de acá y jugamos acá\", soltó la defensa con una sonrisa tras haber tenido la oportunidad de reencontrarse con su mamá previo al partido con la Tri, \"un equipo demasiado fuerte\", al que enfrentarán \"aferradas a la idea de juego que venimos trabajando\".\nLo mismo piensa el técnico Paniagua antes del juego en el Atanasio Girardot, estadio en el que la estrella Linda Caicedo conquistó en 2019 su primer título como profesional con apenas 14 años de edad y siendo jugadora del club América de Cali.\n\"México tiene muy buena circulación del balón, posesión, posición. Es una selección con muchas variantes\", sostuvo el estratega, a la espera de un partido redondo en su ciudad para lograr el objetivo de clasificar en primer lugar, ojalá con nueve puntos tras superar a Australia y Camerún.\nPara conseguirlo, el cuerpo técnico viene trabajando con el psicólogo Rafael Zabaraín en el \"control de las emociones y en \"no creernos favoritos\", pese a que todo un país sueña con el título.\n\"Siempre vamos a trabajar para ganar, salimos a competir para ganar (...) en un mundial hay rivales con unas estructuras muy grandes y muy fuertes, y nosotros respetamos, pero sí digo que Colombia está para jugar mano a mano con cualquier selección\", aseguró Paniagua.\nJeimmy Paola Sierra",

    "text": "CUCARACHAS Ni laurel ni albahaca: la poderosa hierba aromática que asusta a las cucarachas al instanteOlvídate de esta plaga gracias a una desconocida planta que jamás se utilizó para esta práctica. En múltiples ocasiones te hemos recomendado utilizar plantas aromáticas para repeler cucarachas, como por ejemplo la albahaca, el laurel y hasta la menta. En este caso, te mencionaremos otro ingrediente estrella que incluso puedes tener en tu cocina en este momento. Se trata de una hierba que cuando se seca la utilizamos en diversos platillos. ¿Cuál es la hierba aromática que ahuyenta cucarachas? Estamos hablando nada más y nada menos que del orégano, un ejemplar con múltiples beneficios para la salud, pero también para tareas hogareñas, como esta para repeler plagas. En consecuencia, hoy te enseñaremos cómo utilizarlo para ahuyentar cucarachas del hogar, debido a que no será suficiente con poner la planta en puntos estratégicos o espolvorear las hojas secas por los rincones de la vivienda. Especialistas sugieren preparar una sencilla mezcla. La misma consiste en la combinación de agua, vinagre y orégano. De vinagre vas a añadir 500 ml, es decir, medio litro, y un litro de agua. Todo en un recipiente. Mezclarás y luego agregarás 50 gramos de orégano. Volverás a mezclar y luego será momento de aplicar fregando el piso con un paño y dejando secar para volver a pisar el suelo y evitar ensuciar todo. Si crees que las hojas de la planta ensuciarán, puedes previamente colar la preparación y recién allí trapear el piso. Con el fuerte olor de la mezcla, las cucarachas huirán al instante de tu hogar. Incluso, si no quieres que regresen, puedes volcar la preparación en una botella con spray y rociar por paredes, puertas y ventanas. Mientras que, si no quieres hacer todo este procedimiento, también podrás comprar aceite esencial de orégano y repeler a las cucarachas gracias al fuerte olor de este producto que suelen vender en las tiendas. Así, las plagas serán un problema del pasado, aunque debes tener cuidado al momento de aplicar porque puede irritar ojos y fosas nasales.",
