Jamal Bryant announces his engagement to fellow pastor Karri Turner on social media via a livestream of his sermon on May 26, 2024. CREDIT: Unsplash.com / Alekon Pictures Congratulations are in order for Rev. Jamal Bryant and Rev. Dr. Karri Turner, as the two are now engaged to be married. The couple announced their engagement on social media via a video that was shot during Sunday service at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church on May 26, where Bryant currently serves as senior pastor.\nIn the video, shared by Bryant on Instagram, he is seen explaining his decision to propose to Turner before bringing her out on stage.\n“Sometimes your blessings will be right in front of your eyes and you don’t even know what God’s got for you. an amazingly beautiful woman, an amazingly brilliant woman. Last year she graduated with her doctorate degree” he recalled. “As I saw her walk across that stage and get her degree the Lord said ‘You big dummy, what are you waiting on?’”\nCongregation members stood and cheered as Bryant continued to gush over his now fiance, noting how special she is to him.\n “She makes me a better man. I wanted to marry her because I wanted her to be the moon, because I don’t want there to be a night that I don’t see her,” declared Bryant. “I wanted her to be the sun, to be a reminder that the dark season of my life is over. I wanted her to be a rainbow, just to be a reminder that God’s promise is still good for my life. I wanted her to be the rain to let me know that the harvest is coming.”\n“For five years you’ve just had a pastor– but going forward for the rest of my days you’re going to have a first lady.”\nSince December of 2018, Bryant has been the senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. He was previously married to reality television star Gizelle Bryant, of Bravo’s “The Real Housewives of Potomac,” from 2002 to 2009.”",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Greenbrier County, West Virginia from 1901-2000 was 31.3. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Greenbrier County, West Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Greenbrier County, West Virginia history.",

    "text": "Amid Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s persistent attack on the Congress and CPI(M) — the INDIA bloc partners — a wave of Left workers and supporters joined Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which reentered West Bengal on Wednesday. CPI(M) state secretary Mohammed Salim, who met Rahul in Raghunathganj along with the party’s central committee member, Sujan Chakraborty and other leaders, said the Left party joined the Congress Yatra to be part of its fight against RSS- [BJP](https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/) and injustice. “We are fighting against the RSS-BJP. [Rahul Gandhi](https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/) also came out with Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra to combat RSS-BJP. We are fighting to save democracy in India. We came here to show our solidarity to this Yatra,” Salim said after the 45-minute-long meeting with Rahul. Claiming that TMC was eager to deboard the opposition INDIA bloc ‘train’, Salim said: “A lot of people boarded a train from the originating station, but one cannot say who will continue to be part of the fight against the BJP and who deboard en route. [Mamata Banerjee](https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee/) now wants to get down from the train and we welcome it.” Hitting out at the TMC chief for alleging that the CPI(M) was trying to control the Opposition bloc’s agenda, Salim said: “The Congress is a very big pan-India party. Does CPI(M) have such strength? But still, she is saying that CPI(M) is controlling the Congress.” “The country is at present divided between justice and injustice. We have come to join this fight against injustice,” he added. He said that while the real fight is for jobs and farmers’ problems, some parties are doing politics over religion. “2024 is a year of struggle for India to decide whether federal structure, secularism, parliamentary democracy will continue to remain in the country. The battle lines have been drawn… We who believe in secularism and federal structure are on one side to save parliamentary democracy. On the other side, the BJP is using central agencies and corruption cases to increase the strength of the NDA,” he said. Claiming that the yatra has been facing obstacles while traversing through Assam and West Bengal, Salim said, “We condemn such obstacles as this is not our political culture.” CPI(M)’s Murshidabad district secretary Jamir Mollah and CPI(M) state committee member Shatarup Ghosh were also present in the meeting. Ghosh had joined the Yatra on Wednesday at Debipur in Malda district. During Rahul Gandhi’s first leg of Yatra in Bengal, CPI(M) leaders like Jibesh Sarkar walked with Rahul in Siliguri. “The meeting took place in a very cordial atmosphere. We are very optimistic. Rahul Gandhi expressed his unhappiness over what the TMC did during his Yatra. What happened in Assam was expected but what happened in Bengal was beyond expectation,” a senior Left leader said. On Thursday, the Yatra began from Sujapur in Malda district from where veteran Congress leader late ABA Gani Khan Choudhury used to get elected. Choudhury was first elected as an MLA from Sujapur in 1967. Later, he became MP and Union railways minister. In 2021, for the first time the Congress lost Sujapur to the TMC. Thousands of people lined along the road to greet Rahul as the Yatra entered Murshidabad district from Farakka. The Yatra travelled more than 100 km to reach Berhampore, the Lok Sabha constituency of state Congress unit president [Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury](https://indianexpress.com/about/adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/). Throughout the roads, there were huge cutouts of Rahul, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, [Priyanka Gandhi](https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-gandhi/), and Congress president [Mallikarjun Kharge](https://indianexpress.com/about/mallikarjun-kharge/) were seen. The ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’, which started in Manipur on January 14, is scheduled to cover 6,713 km in 67 days, while passing through 110 districts in 15 states, before culminating in [Mumbai](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/) on March 20. Covering 523 km across six West Bengal districts so far, the yatra has traversed Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, and Uttar Dinajpur, with Malda and Murshidabad slated for the second phase. —With PTI Inputs Jharkhand Transport Minister and JMM leader Champai Soren was chosen as the new Chief Minister of the state, following the resignation of Hemant Soren. The decision came after a day of uncertainty and political tension, with the ruling alliance fearing horse trading and attempting to keep their MLAs together. Champai was finally appointed by the Governor, despite the Congress accusing the delay of being part of a larger conspiracy.",

    "title": "Ziggy Marley recalls dad Bob Marley's last words to him before his death",
    "text": "Ziggy Marley was 12 years old when his father, Bob Marley, died, and he cherishes their last memory together.\nIn a new episode of \"\nMaking Space with Hoda Kotb\" released Feb. 28, Ziggy Marley shared with Hoda his father's last words to him. Bob Marley died at age 36 in 1981.\nHe recalled being in his dad's intensive care hospital room a few days before the singer died from malignant melanoma.\n\"I was, like, peeping through the window,\" Ziggy Marley, now 55, said. \"And he was like, 'Come here.' So, I went in, and he was like, 'Hey ... well, young Bob, I have a song for you.' And he said these words: 'On your way up, take me up. On your way down, don’t let me down.'\"\nShortly after, Ziggy Marley said he learned his dad had died while visiting his grandmother in Miami.\n\"I think I was downstairs and the call came,\" he said. \"I told you I'm very observant. I listen and I look a lot. Nobody didn't say, 'Oh, your father died.' ... Then I saw my sister. I saw her face. I knew.\"\nThe heralded Jamaican reggae star is the namesake of the new film “Bob Marley: One Love,” released in theaters Feb. 14. Producers include his widow, Rita Marley, and two of his kids, Ziggy Marley and Cedella Marley. Kingsley Ben-Adir, Lashana Lynch and James Norton star.\nEntertainment News\nZiggy Marley, plus Lynch and Ben-Adir, previously shared with TODAY.com what it was like to bring Bob Marley's life story to the big screen. Read on to learn more about the music icon's life.\nWho are Bob Marley’s parents?\nNorval Marley and Cedella Booker had Robert Nesta Marley in 1945. The film briefly mentions them in select scenes, but does not go in depth about how they met.\nIn the scenes, an adult Bob Marley, portrayed by Ben-Adir, grapples with never really knowing his dad, who did not claim him, and having a mom who lived in the U.S. when he was in Jamaica.\nBen-Adir says he listened to the singer's discography to help him with his character development.\n\"Every week, I'd change an album. I was shifting between all of the music as we were filming. And the last song I really studied was 'So Jah S'eh' in Jamaica and I think that song has really stayed with me.\"\nThe song, which highlights Marley's Rastafarian religion, is a song about unity, hope and the need for social justice.\n\"Not one of my seeds shall sit on the sidewalk and beg bread,\" the lyrics say. \"And verily, verily, I'm saying unto thee, ignite oneself and love humanity.\"\nWho are Bob Marley’s children?\nThe \"One Love\" singer had 12 children.\nBob Marley had his three oldest children, Cedella Marley, Ziggy Marley and Stephen Marley, with his widow, Rita Marley, in 1967, 1968 and 1972, respectively. Bob Marley also adopted two of her kids, Sharon Marley, whom Rita Marley had in 1964 before marrying the singer, and Stephanie Marley, born in 1974. Rita Marley's sixth child, Serita Stewart, was born in 1985, after Marley’s death.\nBob Marley also had Rohan Marley with Janet Hunt and Robbie Marley with Pat Williams in 1972. The reggae legend had Karen Marley the next year with Janet Bowen and Julian Marley in 1975 with Lucy Pounder. In 1976, Ky-Mani Marley was born to the singer and Anita Belnavis, a table tennis champion in Jamaica. Two years later, in 1978, Damian Marley was born to Cindy Breakspeare, a jazz musician and model who was crowned Miss World in 1976. Lastly, Bob Marley had Makeda Jahnesta in 1981 with Yvette Crichton.\nZiggy Marley tells TODAY.com that his father’s life and legacy was all about “being a good human (and) being, really, someone who is of service to others.”\n“Not a selfish person — (he’s) a good example for all of us as human beings going into sacrifice for the betterment of the community and the people,” he added.\nKeep reading to learn more about Bob Marley and the true story behind the film.\nHow did Bob Marley die?\nMarley died of malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer, found when getting treatment for a foot injury sustained during a game of soccer. He was diagnosed in 1977 and died four years later at the age of 36.\nOne year before his diagnosis, the singer survived an assassination attempt, in which his wife was shot in the head. Rita Marley also survived the shooting.\nAlthough there's still debate over who shot Bob Marley and his wife, the documentary about the shooting,\n\"Who Shot The Sheriff? A Bob Marley Story,\" says that it was politically motivated.\nWhere is Bob Marley buried?\nMarley is buried at a mausoleum in his honor in Nine Mile, Jamaica, his birthplace.\nFans may visit and tour the burial grounds.\n\"I don't have to go there to visit my dad,\" Ziggy Marley said.\n\"Anywhere I go, I can visit my dad spiritually,\" he added. \"We're spiritual people, so we live in that world. We'll visit him or he visits me every now and again.\"\nWhere is Bob Marley's wife, Rita Marley, now?\nRita Marley currently lives in Miami. The couple married in 1966.\nAfter Marley's death in 1981, she converted their home in Kingston to\nthe Bob Marley Museum in 1987 and founded the Bob Marley Foundation in 1986. She continues his work of loving people through these initiatives.\nLynch, who portrays Rita Marley in the film, met her on a few occasions and says her presence has a \"kind of effect.\"\n\"Going in just with my knowledge I had already about her as one of Jamaican heritage, I had an abundance of respect and love for her from afar,\" Lynch says. \"It was wonderful.\"\n\"She was open and giving and loving, and just has such a generous spirit that it felt like anything that I needed was going to be provided just energetically,\" she continues. \"And I really appreciate her opening her doors for me because she didn't have to. So to do that on multiple occasions felt like an honor.\"\nWhat did Ziggy Marley tell Hoda about his family on the ‘Making Space’ podcast?\nZiggy Marley opened up on the Feb. 28 episode of “Making Space with Hoda Kotb” about his father’s last words to him not long before Bob Marley died.\n“I was, like, peeping through the window,\" Ziggy Marley said. \"And he was like, ‘Come here.’ So, I went in, and he was like, ‘Hey ... well, young Bob, I have a song for you.’ And he said these words: ‘On your way up, take me up. On your way down, don’t let me down.’”\nShortly after, Ziggy Marley said he learned his dad had died while visiting his grandmother in Miami. Ziggy Marley was 12 at the time.\n“I think I was downstairs and the call came,” he said. “I told you I’m very observant. I listen and I look a lot. Nobody didn’t say, ‘Oh, your father died.’ ... Then I saw my sister. I saw her face. I knew.”\nBefore Bob Marley's passing, Ziggy Marley said he tried to cut a deal with God that he'd be \"a good boy\" if he could see his father one more time. He also told Hoda that as a spiritual person, his father has never really left him.\n\"His presence is in me. I'm a part of his presence. And every now and again, I can see him in me. I can feel him in me and I can see some of his actions in me,\" Ziggy Marley said.\nZiggy Marley said looking back, he wishes he had spent more time with his father during his last days to make decisions on his end-of-life care.\n\"He had a lot of people around him, but I don’t think he had the right people around him,\" Ziggy Marley said.\n\"He was working hard and he was sick, and nobody could, like, pull the plug (and let him rest and heal),\" he said. \"It's like those guys around him were — I don't respect that at all.\"\n\"So I wish that I was around, if I could have given him the right advice. He wasn't getting it right,\" he said.\nThis story first appeared on\nTODAY.com. More from TODAY:",

    "title": "Public warned as mission to recovery huge whale from River Thames at Cliffe, Hoo Peninsula hit by delays amid Storm Gerrit",
    "text": "More on KentOnline People are being urged to keep their distance ahead of efforts to recover a dead whale washed ashore. The marine giant was first [discovered by a dog walker and his son](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/massive-whale-found-washed-up-onshore-299249/) off the River Thames in a remote part of Cliffe, on the [Hoo Peninsula](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/), yesterday. The Port of London Authority (PLA) has since confirmed it to be a juvenile female fin species. It had initially been believed to be a Minke whale but images posted to social media have helped the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme correctly reclassify it. In the meantime efforts to remove the whale have been hampered by Storm Gerrit. It is believed either a hide tide and strong winds have caused a mooring line to come loose. The whale remains on shore but is now further inland with a red strap and rope attached to it by the PLA as part of the recovery process. It is believed either a hide tide and strong winds have caused a mooring line to come loose. A spokesman for the PLA said: \"Currently the body of a whale that washed up on Wednesday at Cliffe is still on the foreshore. \"Our Marine Services team is working to determine the safest way to remove the body. \"Recovery efforts have been hampered by Storm Gerrit, the mudflats along the rocky foreshore and limited road access at the site. \"The removal of a buoy also set back our ability to remove the whale on Friday, [although] weather conditions appear likely to improve early next week.” The public are being asked to keep their distance and not to interfere with the carcass or remove any equipment. The spokesman added: \"As with any wild animal carcass, there is a risk of it carrying harmful bacteria, including due to decomposition - people should keep their distance.” New drone images from photographer and drone operator Geoff Watkins show the whale further inland today. Mr Watkins, who runs Aerial Imaging South East, captured images of the sad spectacle from above. Jack Theed, 33, who came across the whale yesterday, told KentOnline: \"It was just absolutely massive. \"I've lived in Cliffe for 23 years and never seen anything like this before. \"The bit I walked around isn't somewhere a lot of people go. \"I would guess it’s about 30ft, but it's hard to gauge of course.\"",

    "text": "Por Alex Ocaña - Miami enero 25, 2024 12:59 pm EST Este 25 de febrero llega a su fin la semana de la Alta Costura en París y, como cada año, los distintos eventos que se realizan en la ciudad francesa llaman a distintas celebridades de todo el mundo para conocer las colecciones más especiales y detalladas de reconocidas casas de moda.\nTe puede interesar: Zendaya debuta nuevo ‘look’ para el desfile Alta Costura de Schiaparelli\nA lo largo de la semana hemos visto la reaparición de personajes como Rihanna, quien asistió al desfile de Dior o Gwyneth Paltrow, quien hizo lo propio para conocer la propuesta de Armani Privé , pero también hay una mexicana que asistió a esta gran fiesta de la moda: la actriz Sofía Casto.\n©sofia_96castro La hija de Angélica Rivera y ex hijastra del anterior presidente de México estuvo en el desfile en el que Elie Saab presentó su colección de alta costura titulada “A Desert Rose” y la cual está inspirada en Marruecos. Para esta presentación el libanés hizo una oda a la femineidad y, como ya lo habíamos visto con distintas firmas, la utilización de colores neutros y tonos pastel fueron también protagonistas de su propuesta creativa.\nAsí fue el look de Sofía Castro para el desfile de Elie Saab Estamos viviendo una etapa en la que los colores claros son los más relevantes en todo lo referente a la moda y por tal motivo la guapa mexicana se decantó por una pieza en color perla, muy apropiada para lo que está en tendencia. Se trató de un vestido corto y one shoulder el cual cuenta con un gran moño de cristales en el hombro.\n©sofia_96castro Con la intención de crear un total white look Sofía combinó su vestido de la acual colección ready to wear de Elie Saab con unos altos tacones al tono de Yves Saint Laurent y como accesorio agregó un bolso Peekaboo de Fendi , también del mismo color de su atuendo.\nAlgo que llamó la atención de sus fotos fue que, aunque se guió por los tonos más actuales para su outfit , en cuanto a manicura ella no sigue tendencias y ha optado por continuar con un rojo quemado muy clásico que, a muchos, nos encanta, aunque el french tip y los colores claros sean lo más trendy.\nEn cuanto a joyas, Sofía se decantó por otros clásicos y solo utilizó una pulsera Love y una Juste Un Clou, ambas piezas de Cartier , aunque cabe destacar que lo que no dudó en presumir fue el gran anillo de compromiso que recibió hace unos meses por parte su prometido Pablo Bernot.\nSuscríbete a nuestra newsletter.
