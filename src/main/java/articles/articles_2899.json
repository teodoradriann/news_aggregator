    "title": "Infosys terminates more trainees at Mysuru Campus; offers alternative pathways",
    "text": "On Wednesday, March 26, 2025, Infosys, a leading Information Technology (IT) services company, terminated 30 to 45 trainees at its Mysuru campus after they failed to meet the qualifying criteria in internal assessments, according to a Moneycontrol report.\nThis follows a larger wave of terminations earlier this year, where hundreds of trainees were let go from the same campus, sparking significant controversy.\nSupport measures from Infosys\nUnlike the previous incident, Infosys has introduced alternative career options for the affected trainees.\nThe company is offering a 12-week training programme for potential roles in its Business Process Management (BPM) division, with training costs covered by Infosys.\nTrainees opting out of the BPM pathway will receive a one-month ex-gratia payment, a relieving letter, transportation from Mysuru to Bengaluru, and a standard travel allowance to their hometowns.\nAdditionally, they can stay at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure, provided they submit their travel and accommodation preferences by March 27, 2025.\nInternal assessment to maintain standards\nInfosys informed the trainees via email that they did not meet the standards of the Foundation Skills Training Program, despite being given extra preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, and mock assessments.\nThis move comes after earlier terminations drew criticism for alleged forceful exits, prompting investigations by the Karnataka Labour Department and directives from the Union Labour Ministry.\nPast controversy\nFollowing the earlier layoffs, the Karnataka Labour Department investigated and cleared Infosys of any labour law violations, stating that the trainees were not classified as employees and that the company adhered to its assessment policies, according to an India Today report.\nThey further introduced the mandate to work 10 days a month from the office to get the workforce back on campus.",

    "title": "'Stomping on her stomach over and over': Man gets life for murdering pregnant girlfriend",
    "text": "A Florida man will spend the rest of his life behind bars for beating his 6-months-pregnant girlfriend so badly that he reportedly left shoe tread marks on her skull. Jay Leonard Rodriguez, 49, was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder on Wednesday in a Hillsborough County courtroom for the beating death of Jennifer Barreras, 25, and her baby who died as a result of the attack. On Thursday he was given two life sentences . Berreras and her baby, a girl, died minutes after a premature birth, documents indicate. The victim’s friend, Jessica Gonzalez, testified to seeing Rodriguez pin Barreras against a bedroom wall and punch her repeatedly, according to Tampa Fox affiliate WTVT . “He was picking her up and slamming her to the ground at least four or five times,” Gonzalez testified. “Stomping on her and stomping on her stomach over and over again.” The outlet described Barreras as petite. The affidavit said that a female witness, which they do not name, called 911 at 3:25 a.m. “When officers arrived on scene they discovered the female victim to be unresponsive, severely bruised and swollen around her head and officers began life saving measures,” they wrote. “The victim was noticeably pregnant (approximately six months along).” The witness told police about Rodriguez beating the victim even after the victim “was cowering down to her knees,” the affidavit stated. This witness told him to stop and in response, he threatened her with physical violence too if she got involved. “The witness continued to watch as the defendant threw the victim down on the tile floor and kicked her several times in the face and stomach area,” the affidavit said. “She also observed the defendant stomp on the victim’s face and stomach area.” The victim fell unconscious, lying motionless and no longer screaming for help. Even then, the defendant kept kicking and punching her. The witness called 911 and the defendant left. “The witness observed the victim unconscious and having difficulty breathing and attempted CPR at the instruction of the 911 dispatcher,” documents said. According to authorities, the baby was born with a heartbeat at 4:15 a.m., but Barreras was declared dead at 4:25 a.m., and the baby lived only a few minutes more, being declared dead at 4:35 a.m. Hours before testifying, Rodriguez sought a plea deal with prosecutors, but they rejected him, according to WTVT. When he finally took the stand, he painted Barreras as the aggressor, and that if he ever touched her, it was to stop her from striking him. He denied ever hitting her, let alone killing her. “When I left that night she was alive, and she was cussing at me like she always do when you have little respect,” he said. But authorities reportedly said that shoe tread marks on Barreras’ skull matched the shoes Rodriguez wore that night. It took jurors less than an hour to return a verdict for two counts of murder in the second degree, according to the outlet.

    "title": "Ohmium International to double electrolyser manufacturing capacity to 4 GW by 2026 - The Economic Times",
    "text": "Mumbai: Ohmium International, a US-headquartered developer of electrolyser systems for green hydrogen production, plans to double the capacity of its electrolyser manufacturing facility near Bengaluru to 4 giga watts (GW) by 2026, a company official said.Ohmium on Friday commissioned a new giga factory in Dodaballapura, near Bengaluru, which is ramping up to ship 2 GW of electrolyser systems a year.Electrolysers are the core equipment for green hydrogen production. They split water into oxygen and hydrogen using electricity – a process known as electrolysis. Green hydrogen is gas made by electrolysers using power from renewable energy sources and is essential for decarbonising industries.Ohmium designs, manufactures, and deploys advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. It has two R&D centres in India – in Chennai and Bengaluru – besides its manufacturing facility in Karnataka.“As people place orders for now, 10s and 20s of megawatts at a time in 2024, we expect that might have our factory be something like 10% full. But what we see happening is that the sizes of projects are growing and next year, it's likely that orders are in the 100 to 200-megawatt range,” said Arne Ballantine, chief executive and cofounder of Ohmium International. “So, we feel that we’re right on time, having capacity to go to two gigawatts per year, and our cycle time to further double or triple is only two years,” he told ET.Ballantine said the company plans to continue to use India as an operations and engineering hub. “Our R&D centre is connected with IIT Madras and their tech park facility,” he said.The capacity of Ohmium’s current manufacturing facility is 500 MW.The new gigafactory is its second manufacturing facility in India, and its first to bring together key manufacturing, assembly, quality assurance, testing, warehouse and shipping facilities under one roof. “Ohmium’s unique hyper modular PEM electrolysers are designed for mass production and easy assembly,” said Ashwin Varma, chief operating officer of Ohmium.Ballantine said 2GW of electrolysers can abate four million tonnes of CO2 per year – equivalent to the CO2 captured by 180 million trees.The company said the new gigafactory represents major investment in local real estate, equipment and talent and is part of Ohmium’s consistent and growing track record of PEM electrolyser leadership in India – including its historic 400 megawatt (MW) deal with NTPC in 2023, its strategic partnership with Tata Projects in 2024, and its selection for the Ministry of Renewable Energy’s first round of Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Incentives.Ohmium’s research engagements with India’s CSIR-Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CSIR-CECRI) and IIT Madras Research Park (IITMRP) enable rapid transfer of innovation into production to meet the growing demand for green hydrogen projects in India and around the world, the company said.",

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sports Chiefs celebrate with Chris Jones as he gets a sack to hit a big contract incentive Frank Schwab NFL/betting writer Mon, Jan 8, 2024, 2:33 AM · 1 min read 285\nWhile many of the Kansas City Chiefs key players sat out Sunday's regular-season finale, defensive star Chris Jones was still on the field in the second half.\nHe had good reason.\nJones needed one sack to hit a seven-figure bonus. Jones would get a $1.25 million bonus if he hit 10 sacks this season. He came into the final game at 9.5.\nIn the third quarter, he got his $1.25 million sack. And the Chiefs were well aware. Jones came through the middle and sacked Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Easton Stick . That started a celebration that wasn't just Jones, but most of his teammates. The whole sideline erupted with the sack.\nChris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs was a lot richer after Sunday's game. (Photo by Perry Knotts/Getty Images) The celebration said plenty about what Jones' teammates think of him.\nA similar scene happened in Baltimore on Saturday, when Ravens edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney got a sack for a big bonus and celebrated it . Remember: Players know what stats they need to hit certain incentives, and often their teammates know too.\nJones was given hugs on the sideline from defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and coach Andy Reid after the sack. Jones' season started with a contract holdout as he sought a large long-term deal. He eventually reported on a new one-year deal after missing the first game of the season. On Sunday, Jones made plenty of money for himself.",

    "text": "三立新聞網 setn.com 古代宮女為何無人敢娶？年紀大出宮下場淒涼 揭背後真相超驚悚 閱讀全文 三立新聞網 2025年4月30日 下午4:05\n大陸中心／綜合報導\n近年來，古代宮廷劇受到大眾喜愛，無論是清宮劇還是古裝劇，都會出現宮女和宦官，事實上，宦官自秦代開始就已經出現，不過宮女的出現時間卻更早，很多人都認為，宮女只是在宮中打雜、伺候權貴等，其實這只是狹義上的解釋，廣義上來說，宮女指的是後宮、包括妃嬪的所有女性。但就狹義來說，也並非隨便哪個女子都能進宮，無論是哪個王朝，其選拔過程都非常嚴格。\n古代宮女出宮後無人敢娶，下場淒涼。（圖／翻攝自微博） ▲古代宮女出宮後無人敢娶，下場淒涼。（圖／翻攝自微博）\n以清朝來說，身分尊貴的八旗秀女，每3年一次「大選」，通常是將這些女子，指婚給其他王爺、權貴當福晉，或是皇帝自己收入宮當嬪妃，而每年一次的「小選」，都是八旗中的下三旗包衣之女，皇室會從中挑選宮女。被選中的女子，多為11到13歲左右，入宮前要先經過培訓，才會派給某嬪妃。在清雍正時期，宮女約到了25歲，就會被放出宮嫁人，可是25歲在當時的人來看，已屬於「大齡女子」。\n大多數宮女被放出宮後，多半無人願意娶回家，原因有2點，一是年紀太大，很多人擔心無法生育，畢竟古代的家族，多重視傳宗接代；另外，宮女雖然在宮內打雜，但多是伺候貴人，運氣好的宮女，可能10幾年來都沒做粗活，像這樣年紀大、又不會做勞作的女子，一般百姓實在是娶不起，而給王宮貴族做妾呢？年紀大、出身也不夠資格，所以導致上不上、下不下的。\n第二點，就是流傳於百姓之間的八卦，有人認為，較美貌的宮女，通常會被嬪妃防範，擔心搶走自己的恩寵，因此很可能被下藥，造成身體損傷、無法受孕。例如像雍正之母，為康熙的德妃，當年德妃就是小選進宮，從宮女一躍升為四妃之一，當然，這也與她產下二名皇子有很大關係。有些幸運的宮女，能夠得到嬪妃的照顧，在快出宮的時候，會給宮女找一個好的人家，但大部分宮女，多是孤獨終身。\n更多三立新聞網報導\n古人為何三妻四妾？除了傳宗接代之外 竟還有這種殘忍作用\n西晉亡國公主下場超慘！流落民間乞討 被拐賣給有錢人為奴\n皇帝28年不上朝！大臣痛批沉溺美色 多年後開棺還他清白\n古代官員退休多選「告老還鄉」 為何不願留在繁華京城？",

    "title": "So much for summer! The start of July was the coldest in Britain for 20 YEARS, Met Office confirms",
    "text": "Britons were forced to ditch their T-shirts and sunglasses in favour of jumpers and jackets last month, as the UK faced the coldest start to July for 20 years. The Met Office has confirmed that temperatures were persistently below average across the UK for the first two weeks of last month. And by 15 July, the mean temperature was 2.0°C below average - in what was provisionally the coldest start to July since 2004. What&#039;s more, England faced 19 per cent more rainfall than average last month. &#039;The start of July continued June&#039;s theme of cooler than average weather, but with the addition of more wet conditions,&#039; Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle explained. The Met Office has confirmed that temperatures were persistently below average across the UK for the first two weeks of last month Britons were forced to ditch their T-shirts and sunglasses in favour of jumpers and jackets last month, as the UK faced the coldest start to July for 20 years. Pictured: spectators at Wimbleon on July 9 Britain&#039;s weather in July Average temperature (°C) Difference from average (°C) UK 14.8 -0.5 England 16.0 -0.4 Wales 14.6 -0.7 Scotland 12.8 -0.6 Northern Ireland 14.0 -0.6 Overall, July was cooler than average in the UK, with average temperatures of 14.8°C - 0.5°C below the 1991-2020 average. While the first two weeks were particularly chilly, temperatures briefly increased in the third week. And by the last week of the month, the highest temperature of the year so far was recorded. This was recorded on 30 July, when people in Kew Gardens and Heathrow basked in 32°C sunshine. Somewhat unsurprisingly, sunshine hours were also below average last month. The UK experienced just 153.7 hours of sunshine - 11 per cent below average - while neither England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales reached their average monthly sunshine. Overall, July was cooler than average in the UK, with average temperatures of 14.8°C - 0.5°C below the 1991-2020 average While the first two weeks were particularly chilly, temperatures briefly increased in the third week, while the last week of the month saw the highest temperature of the year so far. Pictured: Westminster Bridge on July 7 Read More Last month was officially the hottest June on RECORD In terms of rainfall, the UK recorded 82.4mm, which is around average. However, England pulled the short straw, recording 79.0mm of rain - 19 per cent higher than average. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, meanwhile, were all slightly drier than average. &#039;Low pressure across the UK led to unsettled weather at the beginning of the month and several frontal systems brought bands of rain,&#039; Ms Carlisle explained. &#039;Areas of southwest, southeast and northeast England had already received more than the average July rainfall by the 15th.&#039; Unfortunately, things aren&#039;t looking much better for August. In its long range weather forecast (6 August - 15 August), the Met Office forecasts &#039;changeable&#039; weather. &#039;Low pressure across the UK led to unsettled weather at the beginning of the month and several frontal systems brought bands of rain,&#039; Ms Carlisle explained England pulled the short straw, recording 79.0mm of rain - 19 per cent higher than average. Pictured: people react to the rain during a visit to Mayfield Lavender Farm in Carshalton, southern England on July 7 [video_shortcode_video_html_5 src=&quot;https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/07/30/8607214017914162991/1024x576_MP4_8607214017914162991.mp4&quot;] &#039;Much of this period looks likely to be changeable with UK&#039;s weather characterised by a broadly westerly type, which means weather mostly of an Atlantic origin,&#039; the Met Office said. &#039;Within this, low pressure is perhaps more likely to be situated further to the north, bringing more frequent bouts of rain, showers and perhaps windier weather at times. &#039;Conversely, areas further to the south are more likely to see ridges of higher pressure, bringing more in the way of fine, settled weather, though still with the potential for some wetter, thundery or more generally unsettled interludes. &#039;As a result of this, some warm weather or perhaps even short-lived hot spells are likely in the south at times, but overall temperatures are likely to be nearer normal in the north.&#039;",

    "title": "Google's NotebookLM can now turn your notes into videos, and its new Studio is a multitasker's dream",
    "text": "Google’s personalized AI research assistant, NotebookLM, continues to rapidly evolve into an incredibly powerful tool for learning and productivity. This week, Google is rolling out two major updates that were first teased at I/O: the introduction of Video Overviews and a powerful, redesigned Studio panel that unlocks a whole new level of flexibility.\nTurn your notes into a video with ‘Video Overviews’ Most of you are already big fans of NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews, which are great for absorbing information while multitasking. But sometimes, a visual aid is necessary to truly understand a complex topic. That’s where the new Video Overviews come in.\nThis new feature, now rolling out, is a new category of output in the Studio panel. The first format takes the form of narrated slides. Think of it as a visual alternative to an Audio Overview; the AI host creates new visuals to help illustrate points while also pulling in images, diagrams, quotes, and numbers directly from your source documents. This makes it uniquely effective for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts more tangible.\nJust like with Audio Overviews, you can customize the video to your needs by specifying topics to focus on, describing the target audience, and much more. Video Overviews are now rolling out to all users in English, with support for more languages coming soon.\nThe new, more powerful Studio is a multitasker’s dream The second part of this update is a complete overhaul of the Studio panel, and it solves a major limitation of the previous version. Until now, you could only create one of each output type per notebook (e.g., one Mind Map, one Study Guide), which could be restrictive.\nThat’s no longer the case. With the redesigned Studio, you can now create and store multiple studio outputs of the same type in a single notebook. This unlocks some exciting new possibilities:\nStudying for a big exam? You can now create separate Mind Maps or Video Overviews, each focusing on a different chapter of your course notes. Managing a team notebook? You can create different Audio and Video Overviews tailored to different roles to save everyone time. Have a public notebook? You can create a set of Audio Overviews in different languages to make your content globally accessible. The new Studio has four distinct tiles at the top for creating Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, Mind Maps, and Reports, with all your creations appearing in a list below. And to further boost your productivity, you can now multi-task within the Studio panel, letting you listen to an Audio Overview while simultaneously exploring a Mind Map.\nThis is a fantastic pair of updates that makes NotebookLM an even more flexible and powerful tool for understanding, creating, and sharing information. The new Studio will be rolling out to all users over the next few weeks.\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus Introducing Chrome Unboxed Plus – our revamped membership community.
