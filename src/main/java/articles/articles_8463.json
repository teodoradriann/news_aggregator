    "text": "After COP28 ‘Insider’ Climate Activists To Become Increasingly Important\nClimate campaigners will increasingly adopt “insider activist” roles, working to change or challenge their organisations from the inside rather than the outside, a new study says.\nResearch led by the University of Exeter identifies different types of climate activists. As well as “insiders”, there are others who seek to undermine, or even damage, climate-recalcitrant organisations they are members of in the hope of change.\nThe study says the growing climate backlash against traditional outside climate activism and rise of corporate “greenwashing” means collaborating or contesting for meaningful climate action from the inside of organisations is going to become an important new venue for climate activism.\nInsider activists often team-up to work with others in different areas of their organisation or other groups.\nThe research, was conducted by Nick Kirsop-Taylor and Duncan Russel from the University of Exeter, and Anne Jensen, from the University of Aarhus. They analysed 48 existing studies as part of a literature review.\nDr Kirsop-Taylor said: “We found some activists utilise the tools of discussion and persuasion to influence others towards change. Groups of like-minded activists join together to form pressure groups that seek change in others through mobilisation, symbolic protest, and rational discourse drawing attention to injustices, imbalances, and other activist focus. Efforts are based on high levels of expertise in areas relevant to the topic.\n“In contrast there are expert activists, who use their knowledge and expertise in their organisation to pursue change. Their risk profile is different, as they are risking their professional authority and legitimacy, and perceived scientific impartiality in their field of expertise.\n“Some individuals adopt the philosophical perspective that confrontation is the more effective lever for precipitating change in others. They rarely work in true isolation but they can challenge and contest the opinions, positions, and privileges of others and seek to shame or force them to change rather than through reason and dialogue.\n“Where and when critics seeking change in others coalesce and network with like-minded individuals, they can form social movements that exert themselves and take risks collectively for their shared cause. This includes mass civil disobedience, and in places, even violent and non-violent direct action in the pursuit of their cause. This can become the gateway to extremist activist identities and activities.”",

    "text": "Jarrett Allen recorded his seventh straight double-double with 29 points and 16 rebounds as the host Cleveland Cavaliers extended San Antonio’s losing streak to five games with a 117-115 win on Sunday.\nCaris LeVert scored 23 points and Sam Merrill had 18 points on five 3-pointers for Cleveland, which won its third straight. The Cavaliers’ reserves outscored San Antonio’s bench 60-38 with LeVert and Merrill leading the way.\nVictor Wembanyama paced the Spurs with 24 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks. Devin Vassell added 22 points, Tre Jones and Keldon Johnson scored 18 apiece, and Jeremy Sochan had 11.\nSan Antonio trailed by 14 points midway through the fourth quarter before cutting the deficit 117-115 with 42 seconds left after Wembanyama’s layup capped an 11-0 run.\nWembanyama blocked a shot on the Cavaliers’ final possession, but Cleveland escaped with the win after Sochan’s shot from midcourt at the buzzer missed the mark.\nDonovan Mitchell had 17 points and nine assists for Cleveland, which improved to 13-2 this season against teams below .500. Georges Niang chipped in 11 points off the bench.\nSan Antonio claimed a 14-point lead late in the first quarter before Cleveland closed on a 16-6 run to cut the deficit to 32-28. Vassell had 12 points in the period.\nThe Cavaliers settled in and moved ahead 47-43 midway through the second period on back-to-back 3-pointers by Merrill and Niang. Cleveland took a 62-56 lead into intermission.\nMerrill had 18 points on 5-of-8 shooting from 3-point range in the first half to lead all scorers.\nLeVert hit a buzzer-beating trey at the end of the third quarter to give the Cavaliers an 88-84 lead entering the final period.\nCleveland used a 14-2 run to extend its lead to 107-93 midway through the fourth quarter.\nCleveland shot 48.9 percent from the field, including 16 of 43 (37.2 percent) from 3-point range, and improved to 7-2 in its past nine meetings against the Spurs.\nSan Antonio connected on 47.7 percent of its shots and was 14 of 37 (37.8 percent) from beyond the arc.\n–Field Level Media",

As áreas mais afetadas incluem o sul de Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Triângulo Mineiro e partes do Rio de Janeiro e Espírito Santo.\nAlém de ventos intensos e granizo, há possibilidade de formação de tornados e microexplosões, especialmente em Mato Grosso do Sul, Santa Catarina e Paraná.\nRisco para o campo e infraestrutura Os alertas meteorológicos indicam risco de danos a estruturas agrícolas, como silos e galpões, e de cortes no fornecimento de energia devido à queda de árvores.\nNo extremo sul do Rio Grande do Sul, em municípios como Pelotas e Santa Vitória do Palmar, os acumulados de chuva podem ultrapassar 100 mm em 48 horas.\nApesar do cenário de alerta, Müller ressalta que o tempo seco retornará à maioria das regiões afetadas logo após a passagem do ciclone, reduzindo os riscos de enchentes.\nCalor intenso no Nordeste Enquanto o Centro-Sul enfrenta os efeitos do ciclone, o sol predominará no Nordeste, com máximas que podem chegar a 38 °C no norte do Piauí e Ceará.\nAs condições de tempo seco devem favorecer o trabalho no campo, mas a baixa umidade relativa do ar exige atenção dos produtores.",
