    "text": "Action urged to close life expectancy gap between men and women\nHealth leaders are looking to form England’s first ever men’s health strategy.\nElla Pickover\nMen are “disproportionately affected” by a number of serious medical conditions including cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, health leaders have said as they called for input on England’s first ever men’s health plan.\nOn average, men have a shorter life expectancy compared to women – a difference of almost four years – and officials are asking for views on what must be done to “close the gap”.\nMen are also more likely to die by suicide compared to women, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) added.\nThe department said that action must be taken to “prevent and tackle” the biggest issues facing men as it called for insights on what needs to be included in England’s men’s health strategy.\n“Every day, men across England are dying early from preventable causes,” said Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n“Men are hit harder by a range of conditions, while tragically suicide is the leading cause of death for men under 50.\n“Our Plan for Change means we will tackle these issues head on through a men’s health strategy, and today’s call for evidence is the crucial next step in understanding what works, what doesn’t, and how we can design services men will actually use.\n“I urge people to come forward to share their views.”\nOfficials are seeking opinions from the public, health and care workers, academics and employers on what can be done to improve men’s health.\nThe call for evidence will be open for views for 12 weeks on the Department of Health and Social Care website.\nAmy O’Connor, from the men’s health charity Movember, said: “Too many men are dying too young, the men’s health strategy is a once in a generation opportunity to invest in positive change for men and their loved ones.\nJulie Bentley, chief executive of Samaritans, said: “Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 so it’s critical that suicide prevention is front and centre of this strategy. With men making up 75% of all suicides, this strategy is a real opportunity to prevent thousands of deaths.\nMark Brooks, trustee of the Men and Boys Coalition, added: “Men’s health is in crisis and we are pleased the Government has listened to the long-standing call, that we and others have made, for a strategic, not piecemeal, approach.\n“The call for evidence is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for men, organisations and those who care about men’s health to make their voices heard.”\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer rejected the suggestion that a “minister for men” was needed after a number of calls for the position to be made in Government to address issues including behaviour, education and mental ill health.",

    "text": "A row between staff and bosses worsened at University and College Union this week after new strike dates were announced following news of a restructure.\nUnite the Union, which represents 80 percent of the 216 UCU trade union employees, called three days of action from December 9 to 11.\nUnite claims the UCU is “prioritising” the staff restructure instead of resolving its eight-month-long industrial dispute.\nBut the UCU said the strike was a “completely disproportionate response to an employer consultation”.\nThe two parties have been embroiled in an industrial dispute since March over complaints about workplace racism, workplace stress and alleged breaches of collective agreements.\nA walkout was staged during UCU’s national congress in May, and talks have been ongoing since Unite suspended indefinite strike action which was due to start on September 9.\n‘Unnecessary’ In June , UCU general secretary Jo Grady announced the union would conduct a “full review of staffing” following the annual congress.\nLast week she held an all-staff meeting detailing a consultation to streamline the organisational structure and make “very limited revisions” to the job descriptions of 14 employees.\nA few days later, Unite passed a motion at an emergency special general meeting that questioned the timing of the restructure and resolved to use the existing live ballot to announce strike action “as soon as possible.”\nBased on its current mandate, voted on in May when 72 per cent voted to strike from a 79 per cent turnout, the branch agreed to fresh dates for industrial action.\nUnite claims the restructure will impact nearly a quarter of UCU staff, including “detrimental changes” to at least 10 members and modifications to the job descriptions of the equalities team and the all-female national bargaining unit comprising Unite’s branch chair and vice chair Jenny Lennox and Marianne Quick.\nA Unite UCU spokesperson said: “The employer may choose to claim differently, but this is a significant restructure which directly impacts a quarter of UCU staff, and it has negative ramifications for the organisation as a whole as well as UCU members.\n“UCU Unite members’ working conditions are UCU members’ bargaining conditions. None of those things are going to improve until UCU starts behaving like a decent employer.”\nThe staff union has advised members to refrain from attending individual consultations on job and contract alterations. In the meantime, it has called for a pause to the consultation until the results of the independent review of UCU’s organisational culture concludes.\nUCU hit back at Unite, claiming it is simply asking for views on “limited proposed changes”, which could be subject to change based on feedback.\nA UCU spokesperson said: “These proposals are in response to listening to recommendations from members, staff, and Unite UCU themselves. There are no redundancies or job cuts, and five new posts have been created.\n“We are confused and extremely concerned about the decision by Unite UCU to call three days of strike action in response to such limited proposed changes to staffing.”\nUCU bosses urged Unite to reconsider the “unnecessary” strike action, which it said “undermines any efforts” to resolve the dispute and “puts the intentions of Unite in doubt”.\nThey said: “We hope that Unite UCU reconsider this action so that we can all focus on the important work of supporting UCU members fighting for better pay and conditions, as well as those facing redundancies and course closures across the UK.”",

Outro projecto individual também esteve presente no evento realizado no Porto\nO projeto 'pH8' dos alunos da Sala de Projetos de Automação e Robótica (SPAR) da Escola Secundária de Francisco Franco, foi distinguido com uma menção honrosa na Mostra Nacional de Ciência 2025, que decorreu no Centro de Congressos, na Alfândega do Porto.\nDaniel Piloto Noia, João Francisco Fernandes e Rinat Vasilev são os jovens que desenvolveram o 'pH8', sob orientação do professor Jorge Monteiro, projeto apresentado pelo trio de alunos que \"consiste numa embarcação autónoma que absorve resíduos sólidos e líquidos do mar\".\nA Escola Francisco Franco \"teve, ainda, um segundo projeto naquele certame de ciência. O aluno Afonso Serrão, supervisionado pelo professor Horácio Drumond, apresentou Sudoku Solver, programa que criou para resolver tabuleiros de sudoku\", salienta.\nRefira-se que \"a deslocação da representação da Francisco Franco ao Porto foi apoiada pelo programa 'Provas Dadas' da Direção Regional de Juventude\", lembra a escola, sendo de frisar que \"a Mostra Nacional de Ciência reúne anualmente no Porto projetos científicos criados por alunos em contexto escolar\".",
