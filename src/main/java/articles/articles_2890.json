    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "A university don and President of the Historical Society of Nigeria, Professor Sam Aghalino, has lauded the Isoko Professionals Association in Delta State for its efforts towards reducing illiteracy and unemployment among indigenes of Isoko land.\nAghalino gave the commendation during the 15th anniversary of the IPA/award ceremony, held at James Ekpre Otobi Hall, in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State.\nThe event also featured the presentation of 24 white marker boards, marker pens and dusters to selected principals of secondary schools across Isoko North and South local government areas, to aid basic education and literacy among young people in Isoko ethnic nation.\nThe IPA is a conglomerate of Isoko sons in various endeavours with like minds, who have been contributing to the educational and human capital development of Isokoland.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Aghalino maintained that an association like the IPA deserves commendation because “it has been able to garner and personify its challenges and how it can solve them.”\nHe added, “My own is just to acknowledge them, applaud their vision and encourage them to do more.”\nHe spoke further, “The pursuit of goodwill is something to be celebrated. What I know of this association year in, and year out is they engage in interventions. Education is light, without education many of us would have been in the village riding motorcycles as a means of livelihood. But education is a cake that can take anybody from nowhere to somewhere.”\nThe don therefore urged the association to open the door to let more people join it, admonishing it not to be politicized, noting that one of the factors that destroys any association is politics.\nConsequently, he admonished members to play their politics outside the group and concentrate on their vision and mission statement.\nIn his welcome address, IPA President, Sir Benson Onome Anaro, stated that the occasion of the group’s 15th anniversary “should be seen as a time for sober reflection on its overriding objective, which is the emancipation of Isoko nation.”\nHe said, “It is no news that the Isoko nation is a minority within the minority of the political entity called Nigeria. Consequently, the Isoko indigene is an endangered species by default. These are plain realities gazing boldly at every Isoko girl, boy-child, every Isoko youth, every Isoko adult male and female, every Isoko employee, every Isoko entrepreneur, and every Isoko politician. No one is exempted.\n“The theme for our 15th anniversary is therefore carefully selected for us to gather in our native soil, to reflect as a people on our many and various challenges and chart a progressive and sustainable way forward.”\nIn their separate speeches, the awardees, the Iyasere of Oyede kingdom, High Chief Enahoro Eta; IPA Patron, Chief Paul John Odhomor; the immediate past Chairman of Isoko North Local Government Council, Hon Elder Emmanuel Egbabor and a philanthropist, Deacon Martins Okeoghene Ugbegwo, all commended the IPA for “the kind gestures and humanitarian services rendered towards the growth and development of education in Isoko nation.”\nOne of the awardees, Master Anthony Favour Oghenero, who was presented with a cash prize of N199,000 for inventing a drone and aeroplane, expressed satisfaction and gratitude to the IPA, stressing that the awards would further spur recipients to do more.",

    "text": "Dauphin Junior High School’s eighth-grade football team lit up Wildcat Stadium’s scoreboard lights Tuesday, downing New Brockton High School’s Gamecocks, 35-0, despite having three touchdowns reversed by penalties. Dauphin’s Hayes Weber set the evening’s tone with a 65-yard touchdown run on the game’s first play; Jace Trull added the PAT with 7:40 left in the first quarter, 7-0, DJHS led. Weber had four carries that counted for 135 yards plus waived off scoring jaunts of 73 and 70 yards. New Brockton was unable to move the ball on its first possession; New Brockton’s Micah Davis intercepted a Dauphin pass shortly thereafter but to no avail when the Gamecocks couldn’t produce a first down. After having Weber’s 73-yard run negated, Dauphin went to the air; David Killingsworth connected with James Hardrick on an 83-yard scoring strike. Trull’s PAT put DJHS ahead, 14-0, with nine seconds remaining in the first period. Dauphin defenders gave little ground throughout the game, but New Brockton kept the ball all but four plays in the second quarter. People are also reading… On the second Dauphin snap, Wilkerson raced 71 yards for the TD; Trull added the PAT making it 21-0, a score that remained unchanged until midway through the third quarter when Hardrick intercepted an NBHS pass and scooted 62 yards for the period’s lone touchdown. Trull added the PAT; Dauphin led, 28-0. After Weber’s 70-yard scoring jaunt was waived off late in the third period, the Fins controlled the ball early in the fourth period and had a third TD reversed by a penalty that put the ball at Brockton’s 42-yard line. Del Fulton broke a run to the visitor’s 7-yard line and after a series of penalties, Dauphin got the game’s final score, a 22-yard pass completion from Killingsworth to Hardrick. Trull’s PAT ended scoring at 35-0, with 2:48 left to play. Ty’Rell Ryder and Kardai Patterson also ran the ball for Dauphin. Mason Carrington, Kaiden Jackson, Shakir Middleton, Cole Danford and Carter Johnson shared time in New Brockton’s offensive backfield.",

    "text": "About 2.9 billion people may have had their personal financial data compromised, a lawsuit alleges. “It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when” you may be personally affected by a breach, one expert says. Experts say there’s one best step to take to protect your personal data. About 2.9 billion people may have had their personal information hacked , a new proposed class action lawsuit alleges.\nIf true, reports suggest all Americans may have had valuable personal information compromised — including full names, current and past addresses, Social Security numbers and information on parents, siblings and other relatives.\nThe alleged April 2024 breach occurred when a background check company doing business as National Public Data, owned by Jerico Pictures Inc., failed to properly safeguard information it scraped, the lawsuit states. The company provides instant search access to billions of records.\nNeither National Public Data nor Jerico Pictures returned requests for comment by CNBC.\n“If this turns out to be accurate … then it would just basically mean that everyone’s affected,” said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at The National Cybersecurity Alliance, a non-profit organization focused on cybersecurity awareness and education.\nHowever, this breach may not be as far-reaching as reports suggest, said James E. Lee, chief operating officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center, a non-profit organization working to minimize the risk of identity theft.\nFor example, if there were multiple records per individual compromised, that could reduce the total number of people affected. If other countries were affected too, that could reduce the number of Social Security numbers involved. In addition, much of the information leaked may have already been available elsewhere, he said.\n‘You’re vulnerable forever’ Massive data breaches are not new.\nA 2017 Equifax data breach was estimated to have affected half the U.S. population. A 2013 Yahoo data breach may have affected all the company’s accounts, or 3 billion people total.\nStill, experts say the news of this latest breach should put consumers on high alert.\n“It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when,” Steinhauer said. “I’d be surprised [if] there are many people who haven’t been affected by a data breach like this already, just because of the sheer number of breaches that have happened that contain similar data.”\nMore from Personal Finance:\nSocial Security cost-of-living adjustment may be 2.6% in 2025\nHere’s the inflation breakdown for July 2024\nA U.S. construction boom is sending rents lower\nConsumers tend to find out their information may have been compromised through data breach notices from the companies affected.\n“We’ve got enough data now to say if you get a data breach notice, there’s a high likelihood that you’re going to suffer an identify crime at some point within 12 months,” Lee said.\nWhile it’s still not possible to directly correlate a breach to an identity crack, he said, the risks have no expiration date once your information has been exposed.\n“You’re vulnerable forever,” Lee said.\nFreezing your credit is the ‘number one piece of advice’ The best tip to protect your personal records is to put a security freeze on your credit reports, which will limit access to your records, experts say.\nIt’s also the best first step if you think your data has been compromised.\n“Freezing your credit is the single most important thing you can do when you get a data breach notice,” Lee said.\nThe process can be done quickly and for free by submitting separate requests to each of the three credit bureaus, which includes Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\nWhile freezing your credit will limit access to your credit reports, it won’t block it completely. Your records will still be available to certain companies and under certain circumstances.\nThe freeze doesn’t just block bad actors. Notably, if you want to apply for a new credit card or auto loan, you may get rejected if you do not unfreeze your credit first.\nAs you freeze your credit, you should proceed with caution. Make sure you’re not clicking on a lookalike domain that purports to be one of the three major credit bureaus that could instead be operated by hackers, Steinhauer said.\nAdditionally, do not open your personal records on public Wi-Fi, he said.\nConsumers can purchase additional protection through dark web monitoring services, which will let you know when your information is compromised. While that step can provide peace of mind, it’s not going to stop anything from happening, Lee said.\nConsumers should also make sure they have strong and unique passwords that use multi-factor authentication, where two or more steps are used before access to an account is granted. Consumers may want to consider using a password manager, which can help generate strong passwords and store those codes, Steinhauer said.",

    "text": "BRUSSELS — Yemen’s foreign minister urged the European Union on Thursday to increase pressure on the Iran-aligned Houthis who are attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a vital global trade artery.\nHouthi militants, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have launched waves of drones and missiles at vessels heading to and from Egypt’s Suez Canal since November.\nThey say their actions are a demonstration of solidarity with the Palestinians amid Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza but the attacks have disrupted shipping, prompting U.S. and British strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.\nThe 27-nation EU aims to launch its own Red Sea naval mission by mid-February to help protect ships there.\n“Just striking the Houthis won’t do enough. We need mid and long term solutions,” Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, foreign minister in Yemen’s Aden-based government that is backed by Saudi Arabia, told reporters ahead of talks with EU officials.\n“The EU has the wrong approach. They need to exercise more pressure on the Houthis such as by designating them as a terrorist group. Their argument is that if they adopt this then it will worsen the humanitarian situation,” he said.\n“But this approach didn’t work. The Houthis are still blackmailing the international community and the humanitarian situation has not improved.”\nHe also called for more EU support for building Yemeni institutions such as the coastguard and for humanitarian aid to be channeled through the central bank in Aden.\n“Houthis will never stop… They have the ideology that as a group they have a divine right (to rule) in Yemen,” he said, adding that they were also part of Iran’s regional strategy.\nHe said the West’s lack of a “clear path” to ending the conflict in Gaza and securing justice for the Palestinians was strengthening “all the extremists groups in our region.” — Reuters",

    "text": "Lowering credit card processing fees is a crucial aspect for businesses striving to maximize profitability while ensuring a seamless payment experience for their customers. In today's dynamic market, where digital transactions are predominant, understanding and implementing strategies to reduce these fees can significantly impact a company's bottom line. Negotiating Better Terms with Payment Processors One key approach to managing these costs is through negotiating better terms with payment processors. Businesses often overlook the potential savings that can be achieved by simply reviewing their current agreements and engaging in negotiations. This proactive stance can lead to more favorable rates and reduced per-transaction costs. Leveraging Advanced Payment Solutions Another effective strategy involves the integration of advanced payment solutions. Companies like Optimized Payments specialize in offering innovative payment processing systems that are not only efficient but also cost-effective. By leveraging the latest technologies in payment processing, businesses can reduce errors, minimize fraud, and lower their overall transaction fees. Staying Informed and Engaged It's essential for businesses to stay informed about the evolving landscape of payment processing. Engaging in additional reading and research, attending industry seminars, and networking with peers can provide valuable insights into new trends and technologies that can further aid in reducing credit card processing fees. Adopting Efficient Payment Methods Adopting more efficient payment methods is also a key factor. Encouraging the use of less costly payment methods, such as ACH transfers or digital wallets, can be beneficial. These methods often come with lower processing fees compared to traditional credit card transactions and can also offer customers more convenience and security. Regular Review of Billing Statements Moreover, maintaining a keen eye on billing statements and fees is vital. Regularly reviewing statements can help identify any discrepancies or unexpected charges. This vigilance ensures that businesses are not overpaying and helps in keeping track of fee changes that might occur over time. Educating Customers on Payment Options Businesses should also consider the role of customer education in reducing processing costs. Educating customers about the cost implications of different payment methods can subtly influence their choice of payment, potentially steering them towards less expensive options. This strategy not only helps in lowering processing fees but also enhances customer engagement and satisfaction. Utilizing Resources for Better Understanding In line with these strategies, it is important to keep in mind something like 10 Ways to Reduce Your Credit Card Processing Fees . These types of resources offer a comprehensive overview of various tactics and approaches that businesses can employ to minimize their processing costs. According to realtimecampaign.com, understanding the nuances of credit card processing fees and actively seeking ways to reduce them is an ongoing process. It requires a combination of staying informed, utilizing the right technologies, and engaging in best practices in payment processing. The ability to efficiently manage and lower credit card processing fees plays a significant role in the financial health of a business. By adopting a strategic approach, leveraging technology, and staying informed, companies can significantly reduce their processing costs, leading to improved profitability and enhanced customer experiences.
