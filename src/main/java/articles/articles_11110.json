    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Amritsar, Dec 29 (IANS) The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Friday slammed the physical depiction of the Sahibzadas, the sons of last Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, in plays by children in schools under the Veer Bal Diwas events announced by the Central government, terming it against Sikh principles and traditions.\nIt has sought an explanation from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) along with the Union Ministries of Education, Culture, and Minority Affairs.\nSGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami said any such anti-Sikh act cannot be accepted.\nHe said any act against Sikh principles, customs, traditions, and values hurts the Sikh mentality and big objections are coming from the Sikh sangat about the enacting the Sahibzadas under the instructions of the Centre government regarding Veer Bal Diwas in educational institutions in various states.\nHe said taking cognisance of these acts against the Sikh principles, the SGPC has asked Union ministries and the CBSE to present their stand.\nDhami said regarding Veer Bal Diwas, according to the order of Akal Takht Sahib, the Union government had already been approached to change the name of this day, but it has not taken it seriously till date.\nHe said the concern of the SGPC and the Sikh sangat in this regard has come true as efforts are being made to make children play the roles of Sahibzadas by going against the Sikh traditions. He said the responsibility of this anti-Sikh phenomenon lies directly on the Union government and the respective state governments.\nSuch actions can never be accepted by the Sikh world and action will also be taken against the educational institutions by identifying them, that have got the characters of Sahibzadas played in physical form, Dhami said.\n--IANS\nvg/vd\nMENAFN29122023000231011071ID1107668053\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "ChronSports Top 10 of 2023 - No. 7: Mike Elko leaves Duke football for Texas A&M, causing widespread fallout on transfers, coaches",
    "text": "As the bow gets tied on 2023, The Chronicle’s sports department is reviewing the biggest storylines in Duke athletics throughout the year. Each day until the calendar flips to January, we will cover two of the most significant moments in Blue Devil sports from 2023. Coming in at No. 7: After two years at the helm and a notable shift in the tone surrounding Duke football, former head coach Mike Elko made the late-night switch to Texas A&M, causing a change in head coach, personnel and the vision for the program's future. For the full list, click [here](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/chronicle-sports-top-10-full-list-duke-athletics). On Saturday, Nov. 25, Duke was riding a high: fresh off of a [short-handed victory against Pittsburgh](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/11/duke-football-pittsburgh-senior-day-grayson-loftis-jalon-calhoun-jordan-moore-aeneas-peebles), the Blue Devils moved to 7-5 with just a bowl game remaining in head coach Mike Elko’s second season in blue. What the Blue Devil faithful did not realize, however, was that the good times would not keep rolling. Under 24 hours later, Elko made further national headlines, not for his coaching abilities nor Duke’s successes on the gridiron, but for his [rumored coaching switch to Texas A&M](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/11/duke-football-mike-elko-leaves-texas-a-and-m#:~:text=Elko's%20departure%20comes%20after%20numerous,in%20a%20Sunday%20team%20meeting.). For [the Duke community](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/duke-football-fan-reactions-riley-leonard-mike-elko-transfers-future-head-coach-quarterback), mixed reports left fans and players [on the edge of their seats](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/11/duke-football-mike-elko-texas-a-m-player-social-media-reactions-sahmir-hagans-jamion-franklin). Nevertheless, as Duke students closed textbooks and campus buses stopped running later that Sunday night, Elko boarded a private jet to College Station, Texas, to sign a contract with the Aggies. Regardless of the exit, Elko will be known as a culture-shifter for Duke football, and the results speak for themselves. Prior to Elko’s arrival in 2021, Duke mustered just three wins, none of which were in the ACC. Turning around the program, Elko led the Blue Devils to a 9-4 record with a [Military Bowl championship](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2022/12/duke-football-ucf-military-bowl-mike-elko-riley-leonard-plumlee-navy). Arguably, Elko’s most impressive victory came in 2023 as [Duke topped then-No. 9 Clemson](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/09/duke-football-season-opener-clemson-mike-elko-dabo-swinner-cade-klubnik-riley-leonard) in Wallace Wade Stadium. Importantly, the student body rallied around Elko off the field, perhaps leading to [ESPN College GameDay’s first appearance](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/chronicle-sports-top-10-2023-duke-football-espn-college-gameday-mike-elko-riley-leonard-notre-dame-clemson) in Durham for a marquee football matchup against Notre Dame after a 4-0 start. The [fallout of Elko’s departure](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/11/duke-football-transfers-coaching-staff-players-tracker-mike-elko-texas-a-m), though, was vast — a plethora of transfers in and out of the program, including a former ACC head coach joining the Blue Devils to [replace Elko in Manny Diaz](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/duke-football-manny-diaz-head-coach-hire-penn-state-mike-elko-nina-king-riley-leonard). Diaz joined Duke following a short stint at Penn State as defensive coordinator of the Nittany Lions. Prior, Diaz served as head coach at Miami for three years, his only head coaching role in his college football tenure. Diaz led Penn State to a dominant defensive year in 2023, leading the nation in opponent yards per play and finishing third in the country by allowing 11.4 points per game. Throughout and after athletic director Nina King’s search for a head coach, current Duke players and verbally committed recruits were deciding their fates as well. Notably, [starting quarterback Riley Leonard](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/11/duke-football-quarterback-riley-leonard-transfer-mike-elko-texas-a-m) and defensive end R.J. Oben announced their commitments to Notre Dame, defensive tackle Aeneas Peebles signed with Virginia Tech, running back Jordan Waters announced his transition to N.C. State and linebacker Dorian Mausi made his switch to Auburn. Leonard was not the sole signal-caller to announce his intentions elsewhere as four-star recruit Tyler Cherry decommitted following the coaching change, leaving the Blue Devils with a sizable hole for the future of the position. Luckily for Duke, Diaz answered the mass exodus of transfers out of the program with a four-star transfer quarterback of his own: [Maalik Murphy of Texas](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/duke-football-maalik-murphy-transfer-riley-leonard-manny-diaz). Murphy, in his sole season with the Longhorns, sat in a loaded quarterback room filled with high-echelon talent at the position. Nevertheless, he started and delivered victories for Texas in two games this season, passing for a cumulative 418 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. Regardless of prior statistics, Diaz found his starter at the quarterback position just weeks after taking over the Duke job, a promising glance into his recruitment talent. There’s no doubt about it: December was a busy month for Duke that will hold lasting implications for the future of the program. Through the noise, the Blue Devils [delivered in the Birmingham Bowl](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/duke-football-birmingham-bowl-grayson-loftis-kimani-vidal-jaquez-moore-jaylen-coleman), defeating Troy 17-10 behind a dominant defensive performance. Notably, Duke defied prior customs and started some of its transfers, including Peebles. Assistant coach Trooper Taylor said it best in a postgame interview. “We talk about family,” he said. “Blood just makes you kin … love, trust, respect, commitment, hard work, that makes you family.” Although it is rumored that Taylor will head to College Station to join Elko, Diaz will surely [look to Taylor’s principle of family](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2023/12/duke-football-birmingham-bowl-troy-trooper-taylor-todd-pelino-chandler-rivers-jaylen-coleman-future-team-chemistry) as he looks to continue Duke’s upward trajectory. Until then, the new year will surely bring more change to the Blue Devil program as Diaz looks to fill Elko’s shoes as a program-defining head coach.

La delantera colombiana se destaca por sus grandes actuaciones, haciéndola merecedora de este importante premio. Brillante inicio de temporada para la delantera Linda Caicedo quien no se cansa de deslumbrar con su gran talento a todos los amantes del buen fútbol que fecha tras fecha esperan una genialidad de la cafetera que dio un paso hacia adelante, demostrando que la camiseta del Real Madrid queda grande convirtiéndose en corto tiempo en unas de las referentes del equipo. Por medio de las redes sociales, el equipo merengue público una foto donde se ve a la vallecaucana sosteniendo un trofeo que da el diario Marca como reconocimiento a su gran rendimiento que la hicieron merecedora del trofeo a Mejor jugadora del mes de febrero donde a pesar de que su equipo se encuentre en la segunda posición, Caicedo siempre es sinónimo de buen fútbol por lo que este nombramiento es más que merecido. Cabe recordar que la delantera, marcó dos goles durante el pasado mes, donde el primer de ellos fue empezando febrero cuando su equipo goleo 7-1 al Valencia. Ocho días después, volvió anotar, pero esta vez frente a uno de sus eternos rivales como el Atlético de Madrid, contando con la mala fortuna de perder frente a su contrincante en la Copa de la Reina, cayendo eliminadas del importante torneo. Este buen momento no solo se vio vistiendo de blanco, sino también durante la Copa de Oro donde jugó con la Selección Colombia donde pudo marcarles a Panamá y Puerto Rico goles de una calidad impresionante. Lastimosamente, durante esta competición la tricolor se despidió luego de una goleada por parte de Estados Unidos. Durante la entrega de este premio con el Real Madrid, Linda Caicedo tuvo unas palabras. “Es la primera vez que lo recibo y me hace muy feliz. Agradecer al club, a los aficionados y obviamente a mis compañeras, que sin ellas no sería posible todo esto. Es un nuevo premio individual y ahora a seguir con esta racha de aportar lo mejor al equipo\", palabras de una de las promesas más grandes del fútbol femenino del mundo. El equipo de la colombiana jugará este 16 de marzo contra El Eibar a las 2:00 p.m., hora colombiana donde se le recuerda a todos los lectores que el equipo blanco, se encuentra en la segunda posición del torneo a nueve puntos del líder Barcelona que se perfila a ser sólido campeón.",

    "text": "Visit the grand opening of the Bartz Snow Sculpture on January 19th to see their amazing and gigantic design! Mother Nature and a crazy amount of creativity usually make a great team in New Brighton. The Bartz family has been creating large snow sculptures in their front yard since 2012. These sculptures aren’t just large, they are gigantic! When I say “usually” make a great team, the recent warm weather and lack of snow have made things difficult! The GRAND Opening: Bartz Snow Sculpture event usually takes place January 1st. This year it’s been very delayed due to the lack of snow. In fact, they’ve had to make their own snow this year and still delay the opening by a few extra days! The sculpture used to be built in their front yard in New Brighton, but the creations have gotten too big for that! This year it’s being held at the Brightwood Hills Golf Course in New Brighton. It’s open every day from 8am- 10pm. There will also be food trucks, other vendors and events every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There’s no admission to view the sculpture, however the family appreciates donations. Each year the money raised goes towards clean water through the organization One Day’s Wages. When it does open, the hours will be 8am-10 pm until February 10th. However, they’re also inviting the public to come watch them work on the sculpture and there are even food trucks already as well a a treasure hunt, gnome hung and indoor winter market! Keep watching their facebook page for additional updates. Invite your friends, it will be fun! This is original content from NewsBreak’s Creator Program.

    "text": "More than 1 million women experience menopause each year in the United States – and many of them are doing so while at work. According to a national survey, 90% of women aged 35 and over have experienced at least one menopause symptom, ranging from hot flashes to mood swings. A Mayo Clinic study estimates that menopause costs American workplaces more than than $26 billion/year in lost time at work and medical expenses. The lead author, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, pointed out a key “takeaway” from the study “is that there is a critical need to address this issue for women in the workplace.”\nMenopause is technically defined as the point when someone has gone 12 consecutive months without getting a period, while perimenopause is typically a multi-year period the leads up to menopause. Perimenopause can start when someone is in their mid-30s – or mid-50s. And many don’t realize that, even after starting to experience hot flashes and irregular periods, it is still possible to get pregnant.\nAs millions of women navigate the physical and emotional transitions of menopause, a growing chorus of voices is calling for workplaces to catch up. For them, the message is clear: menopause is not just a personal journey—it’s a workplace issue.\nBut that doesn’t mean that workplaces are required to respond to menopause.\n“There’s no specific requirement under federal law for employers to accommodate a worker’s menopausal symptoms,” points out Emily Gold Waldman, who teaches employment law at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University and is the co-author of Menstruation Matters. She notes that existing federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act , can sometimes offer indirect protection. One state – Rhode Island –even enacted legislation earlier this summer to require that workplaces accommodate menopause in the same way that they accommodate pregnancy and childbirth.\nUnless they live in Rhode Island, however, many women face a legal gap that leaves them without recourse when symptoms—like hot flashes, brain fog, and sleep disturbances—interfere with their work. Women may leave their jobs or work fewer hours.\nEven without a legal requirement to do so, workplaces can take steps to help employees manage the menopause transition.\nWhat Workplaces Can Do\n1. Normalize the Conversation\nMost women – 80% -- feel that menopause is “too personal” to discuss at work. Employers can foster open dialogue and offer education to reduce stigma. They can help to create a culture that is open and supportive, points out The Menopause Society in its employer guide, Making Menopause Work. Women in leadership can talk about their own experiences with menopause. Workers can create their own support groups. Some companies, including Nvidia and Genentech, have developed programs for menopause support that include information and specialized health care appointments.\n2. Offer Practical Accommodations\nEmployers can provide improved ventilation, better temperature-controlled spaces, and breathable uniforms to help with symptoms.\n3. Train Managers and HR Professionals\nTo ensure that managers understands menopause, employers can offer training and ensure resources are available through HR departments.\n4. Protect Health Data\nEmployers might use apps to help workers manage symptoms. But, cautions Bridget Crawford, a law professor at Pace University and the second co-author of Menstruation Matters, apps typically collect sensitive health information that could be vulnerable to surveillance. Workers need to know that their information will be safe.\n5. Push for Policy Change\nEven without new federal laws, federal agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, can take actions, points out Waldman. They could issue guidelines that recognize the need for menopause accommodation and that treat menopause-based discrimination as a form of sex or age discrimination. There could be better protection for “intimate privacy” from both the state and federal government, explains University of Virginia law professor Danielle Citron.\nAs menopause becomes more visible in culture and commerce, the workplace must evolve too. Supporting midlife women isn’t just good ethics—it’s smart economics.",
