    "text": "ATE denunció que el gobierno premia a funcionarios por despedir trabajadores y mañana realiza un paro nacionalLa Asociación de Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) realizará este viernes un paro nacional y se movilizará hacia el Ministerio de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, que conduce Federico Sturzenegger.La medida de fuerza se realiza para reclamar la \\\"renovación automática\\\" de miles de contratos estatales que vencen a fines de marzo, la reapertura de las paritarias y la \\\"reparación del deterioro grave\\\" que sufrieron los salarios.El secretario general del gremio, Rodolfo Aguiar, indicó desde las redes sociales que la marcha \\\"tendrá un alto acatamiento\\\" porque en la administración pública \\\"el malestar es creciente en todo el país\\\", añadió.“Exigimos la renovación automática de los más de 50 mil contratos que vencen a fin de mes. Rechazamos cualquier posibilidad de que pretendan compensar el costo fiscal de la rebaja de retenciones al campo y la eliminación de impuestos a la compra de autos de alta gama con nuevos despidos masivos”, agregó.ComunicadoEn un texto dirigido al Ministerio de Trabajo informando sobre la huelga de mañana, ATE asegura que la medida se lleva a cabo porque hay \\\"un congelamiento salarial en la administración pública\\\", al tiempo que pidió \\\"detener el avance autoritario de un Gobierno Nacional que gobierna por decreto, que precariza, empobrece y hunde en la miseria al pueblo argentino\\\".“Las paritarias se deben reabrir de manera inmediata y reparar el deterioro grave que han sufrido todos los salarios. Con aumentos que se han ubicado sistemáticamente por debajo de la inflación, la mayor parte de los ingresos en el sector público quedaron por debajo de la línea de pobreza”, concluyó Rodolfo Aguiar.El jefe de ATE sostuvo además que el gobierno de Javier Milei \\\"vino a llenar sus bolsillos del Estado\\\" y que \\\"son mercenarios que cobran por hacer el trabajo sucio\\\". \\\"Todos los días nos dicen que ahorran y achican, pero nadie sabe quién se beneficia de esos recortes. Evidentemente el hecho de volver a recurrir al FMI demuestra el fracaso del actual programa económico\\\", sentenció.Por otra parte, el gremialista criticó duramente a la administración libertaria al tidar a sus funcionarios de \\\"CEO s fracasados\\\", ya que \\\"se apoderaron del Estado y nos están costando muy caro a todos los argentinos\\\".El sindicato denunció que hay en marcha \\\"un desvío de fondos en detrimento del pueblo\\\", ya que el supuesto ahorro que busca generar el gobierno con los despidos \\\"irá a parar al bolsillo de funcionarios de segunda o tercera línea hasta alcanzar la remuneración de ministro\\\".

    "text": "LOS ANGELES — Timothée Chalamet and “Wonka” topped the box office charts for the third time in its four weekends in theaters. Warner Bros.’ family-oriented musical added $14.4 million in ticket sales according to studio estimates Sunday, bringing its total domestic grosses to $164.7 million.“‘Wonka’ is following in the tradition of a film like ‘The Greatest Showman,’” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. That Hugh Jackman musical opened under $9 million in December 2017 and went on to gross $435 million globally.“‘Wonka’ is a perfect crowd pleaser released at the perfect time and it’s going to ride that wave into January,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s an opportune time for it to be in the marketplace.”After finishing 2023 on a high note, 2024 is getting off to a slower start than last year, down around 16%, with the Universal/Blumhouse horror “Night Swim” as the only major new offering in theaters. The movie stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as a couple with a sinister, supernatural swimming pool.“Night Swim” drew in an estimated $12 million in its first weekend in 3,250 theaters in North America against a reported $15 million production budget. Including international showings in 36 markets, “Night Swim” is heading towards a $17.7 million global debut.“Not only did it perform really well at the box office, but it’s going to make us look at every swimming pool with a little more trepidation,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s head of domestic distribution.Horror movies are largely critic-proof, but with fairly negative reviews and a C CinemaScore rating, it’s unlikely to repeat the viral success of last year’s demon doll movie “M3GAN.”“We don’t have ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which totally dominated the box office a year ago, or ‘M3GAN,’ which made that a bigger weekend,” said Dergarabedian. “But it’s a bit early to call it in terms of how the year is going to turn out.”Warner Bros. and Universal placed third and fourth on the charts as well. Warner Bros.’ DC superhero movie “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” earned $10.6 million in its third weekend, bumping its domestic tally just over the $100 million mark. Universal’s animated “Migration” added $10.3 million, bringing its running domestic total to $77.8 million.Sony’s Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney romantic comedy “Anyone But You” landed in fifth place with $9.5 million, up 9% from last weekend. The movie has grossed $43.7 million to date.Cineplexes are full of awards contenders, including “The Color Purple,” “The Iron Claw” and “Poor Things,” and the Golden Globes broadcast Sunday night might help spread awareness for those and other films.“The Golden Globes are like a three-hour infomercial for the industry,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s no downside to having a very high profile telecast that puts a spotlight on the movies.”Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
