    "text": "All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\nIf you’re watching the new Netflix series about the Colombian drug empire leader, you might be wondering how Griselda Blanco was caught.\nSofia Vergara stars and is the executive producer of Griselda which follows Blanco’s move to the United States from Colombia as she created one of the most powerful cartels in history and her great involvement in the Miami Drug War or the Cocaine Cowboy Wars. The show also stars Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Vanessa Ferlito, and Karol G making her on-screen debut. Related Stories How Did Griselda Blanco Die? Her Signature Assassination Style Caught Up To Her What Happened to Dario Sepulveda? Griselda Blanco’s 3rd Husband Had A Tragic Death\n“Most of the people know of Griselda as the ruthless, violent drug lord that she was,” Vergara said in a press release. “So we were very careful not to glorify her in the series. But we also wanted to take time to uncover the deeper story of Griselda, how beyond all odds, a poor uneducated woman from Colombia managed to create a massive, multi-billion dollar empire in a male-dominated industry, in a country that was not her own, through tactics that she devised that were both ingenious and cruel. The truth is that, as much as Griselda broke down barriers, she’s definitely not a hero and she should not be idolized.”\nShe continued, “So, what I loved about the project was getting to explore Griselda’s origin story, the making of a monster. When you then look at someone like June, a mother trying to fight a male-dominated culture in her workplace, I think more than drawing a comparison, you see more and more why Griselda’s self-justification is so wrong. Griselda and June are different sides of the same coin, the two different paths a person can take in order to take care of their family.”\nSo how was Griselda Blanco caught?\nHow was Griselda Blanco caught? Griselda. Sofia Vergara as Griselda in episode 102 of Griselda. Cr. Elizabeth Morris/Netflix © 2023 Griselda Blanco was caught in Irvine, California on February 17, 1985, after she was tracked by DEA agents for about ten years. According to The United States v. Blanco, Blanco gave a false name to the DEA agents who arrested her, and she was found to be carrying false identification papers. While compared to the show, Griselda called the authorities to arrest her.\n“She was pretty tough and standoffish, a typical Colombian move I would say, nonchalant, not really showing any real emotion, but when we put her in the car, I was in the backseat with her, and the other agent was driving. We drove up to Los Angeles, and when we got close to the courthouse is when she became visibly shaken,” retired Agent Bob Palombo told The Independent. “I mean, visibly shaken, she was shaking, and she grabbed my arm and you could feel her shaking and she turned and she threw up on my shoulder. Not a lot, it was mostly just bile, but she knew the proverbial s*** had hit the fan. And it was time for her to meet her accusers.”\nBlanco was charged with conspiring to manufacture, import, and distribute cocaine. She was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. While serving her sentence, she was additionally charged with three counts of first-degree murder by the state of Florida. She narrowly escaped the death penalty on a technicality when her right-hand man Jorge “Rivi” Ayala was discredited as a witness after being caught having phone sex with secretaries in the prosecutors’ office. Blanco pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to run concurrently.\nShe was released in 2004 due to her health issues, and suffered a heart attack in prison in 2002. Blanco was deported back to Medellín, Colombia where she reportedly lived a quiet life . She was killed on September 3, 2012, in same assassination style that she was often credited with—shot down by two assassins on a motorcycle. “She wasn’t hiding. Not at all,” Palombo said. She was killed at the marketplace, the butcher shop, and according to my sources, she lived a well-respected life in the community. She was supposedly very benevolent to the downtrodden and that may have been a reason that a lot of people didn’t bother with her.”\nDays before the premiere of the Netflix show, Michael Corleone, identified as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the lawsuit documents, and his wife, Marie, are seeking damages “in excess of $50,000,” as well as an emergency temporary injunction to block the January 25 release of Griselda.\nMichael accuses the show’s creators of using his unreleased “artistic literary work” and his likeness “to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo” without permission or credit, according to the lawsuit obtained by Entertainment Tonight.\nThe family made a statement to the site: “It is beyond dispute that Griselda Blanco made the ultimate decision for Michael Blanco, her son, to carry out and benefit from her life as it relates to artistic and literary productions based on her story. Although Michael Blanco is a public figure himself with his own rights to publicity, Mr. Blanco continues to honor his mother’s executed intent. Since 2008, Michael Blanco has worked extremely hard in the entertainment industry where he conducted numerous interviews and tv shows to tell his story. He is also the outstanding author of the book entitled, “My Mother, the Godmother and the True Story of Michael Corleone Blanco the Son of Griselda Blanco.” He published this book in an attempt to fulfill his mother’s wishes and tell the world the intimate details about his life and that of his mother, Griselda Blanco. It is a compelling story.\nMichael Blanco was more than willing to share his hard work and the nonpublic details of his mother’s life with Latin World Entertainment/Netflix if he was to be fairly compensated. Make no mistake, Michael Blanco is humble and thrilled each and every time someone reaches out to shine light on his mother and the Blanco family. However, in the case of Netflix/Latin World Entertainment, the Defendants approached Michael Blanco to gain his work, perspective, and insight to only turn around and act like he does not exist, in an apparent attempt to reap their own profits. It is disappointing that Latin World Entertainment/Netflix would pretend that it is acceptable to use Michael Blanco’s commercial work without his permission.”\nIn a statement to DailyMail, he explained his reasoning for legal action , “I feel that it’s my duty to do it. And if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be keeping my word to my OG, to my mother. I’m just holding it down for the family – and I’m doing it legally.”\nHe continued, ‘I am a history buff so I believe that history should be told not only by the victors, but by the losers. You can call me what you want but I’m in both worlds. Some people will say, ‘You’re glorifying the lifestyle’. I glorify my mother but when you read my book and you’ll see my public apology to the masses, and to the victims of the 1970s and 1980s cocaine and crack wars. I’m apologetic because I myself am a victim… I buried 22 members of my family. I survived countless assassination’s attempts. Look at the way I lost my mother.”\nGriselda is now streaming on Netflix.\nThe Godmother: The True Story of the Hunt for the Most Bloodthirsty Female Criminal in Our Time by Richard Smitten The Godmother $42.99 Buy Now A profile of bloodthirsty Colombian drug dealer Griselda Blanco, known as the “Black Widow” due to her penchant for killing off her lovers, recounts Blanco’s vicious crime spree and the ten-year struggle to bring her to justice. Court records and interviews with Drug Enforcement Administration agents, federal attorneys, Miami police and Blanco’s acquaintances flesh out a portrait of a ruthless cocaine wholesaler whose “mules” (couriers) transported drugs in women’s undergarments and shoe heels. Her propensity for violence was legendary: she bragged of murdering her husband and claimed responsibility for Miami’s “Dadeland Massacre,” a shootout in a mall parking lot that disposed of one of Blanco’s creditors.",

(WSVN) – A couple was arrested after causing a scare outside a day care facility in South Florida.\nEstrella Maria Pereira, who was one of the accused, said the two didn’t realize there was a day care near where they were pulling a publicity stunt.\n“It was a poor decision,” she said.\nPereira and Miguel Ruiz were seen taking two rifles out of a Corvette before aiming it directly at the Devon Aire Kiddy College in Miami-Dade County.\nPereira now says they made a mistake.\n“Really, we’re not bad people, we will never harm anyone or anything,” she said. “We’re bodybuilders and we’re into the social media thing, Youtube Channel, you know, Instagram so forth, and he thought it would be cool to take a picture with a gun, because with muscles and guns, and it sounds really cool, like if you look at a photograph like that.”\nThe incident was supposed to be a photoshoot, according to Pereira, but it put the day care on lockdown and alarmed many parents.\n“We did everything in our power to protect the children that are here in the facility and we followed every measure to stay safe,” an unnamed day care said.\nPereira has since been bailed out, while Ruiz is still being held in custody.\nWhat began as a publicity stunt is now causing the two to be faced with serious charges.\n“It’s ridiculous,” Pereira said. “And yes, it is getting blown out of proportion. But I do understand the severity, and how it could scare somebody, because I would be freaked out if I saw somebody doing the same thing, I’d be freaked out.”\nRuiz and Pereira have been ordered to stay away from the woman who called police and the day care center.\nCopyright 2024 WSVN via CNN Newsource.

But the faction led by Paresh Baruah (known as ULFA-I) is still involved in insurgency activities and has not agreed to come to the table for talks.\n--IANS\ntdr/pgh\nMENAFN29122023000231011071ID1107668301\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "La líder opositora María Corina Machado advirtió este jueves de una inédita “ola migratoria” desde Venezuela si el mandatario izquierdista Nicolás Maduro se aferra al poder tras su discutida reelección, mientras que Estados Unidos anunció mayor presión en caso de ser arrestados dirigentes opositores. Machado, que denuncia fraude y reivindica la victoria de su candidato Edmundo González Urrutia en los comicios celebrados el 28 de julio, envió a través de la prensa un mensaje al presidente mexicano, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, sobre la posibilidad de una inédita “ola migratoria” desde Venezuela si Maduro sigue en el poder “por la fuerza”. “Yo le digo algo (a México), si Maduro opta por aferrarse por la fuerza, por las malas (al poder), sólo podremos estar viendo una ola migratoria como nunca hemos visto: tres, cuatro, cinco millones de venezolanos en muy poco tiempo”, dijo Machado en videoconferencia de prensa con medios de México.

El anuncio de la victoria de Maduro por parte del Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE), de línea oficialista, desató protestas que han dejado al menos 24 muertos, según organizaciones de derechos humanos, y más de 2.200 detenidos, de acuerdo al propio Maduro. Varios gobiernos, con Estados Unidos a la cabeza, han pedido la publicación de actas con los cómputos detallados por parte del ente electoral, mientras se suman a las denuncias de la oposición venezolana de una escalada represiva contra opositores. Publicidad Se incrementa la presión contra Nicolás Maduro Washington, que encabeza el endurecimiento de las sanciones contra Venezuela desde 2019, elevó el tono el jueves advirtiendo que el arresto de los líderes opositores podría “movilizar aún más a la comunidad internacional, incluidos los países que no quieren causar demasiadas olas” contra Venezuela. “Si Maduro decide hacer eso, activará a la comunidad internacional en formas que él no podría imaginarse, y creo que sus esfuerzos por fracturar y dividir a la comunidad internacional habrán fracasado rotundamente”, dijo el embajador de Estados Unidos ante la OEA, Francisco Morante.

Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea y países de América Latina como Argentina y Perú consideran que González Urrutia ganó la elección, e incluso muchos gobiernos aliados de Maduro, como Brasil, le han pedido que entregue las actas de votación. “¿Y qué tienen las tan cacareadas actas que ha causado una especie de histeria internacional desde Washington y algunos gobiernos satélites?”, ironizó este jueves la vicepresidenta Delcy Rodríguez durante un encuentro con miembros del cuerpo diplomático en Caracas. “Hay una histeria internacional sobre las actas, podrían hasta hacer una serie de Netflix, ‘Las actas en Venezuela, histeria colectiva’, me disculpa el embajador de Francia, pero es que hasta tapó las Olimpiadas, las actas tapan las olimpiadas en Francia, porque hay una histeria con las actas”, agregó Rodríguez. Publicidad En medio de las denuncias de fraude electoral, Maduro ha pedido la detención de González Urrutia y Machado, a la vez que acudió a la Sala Electoral del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ), acusado de servir al chavismo, para que certifique su victoria. González Urrutia, un discreto diplomático postulado en las presidenciales ante la inhabilitación de Machado por la Contraloría, de línea chavista, desacató dos citaciones de la máxima corte, que previamente indicó que no acudir “acarreará consecuencias” legales. Tanto González Urrutia como Machado han limitado sus apariciones públicas y Machado, incluso, ha dicho que teme por su vida. La oposición afirma tener un 80% de las actas digitalizadas en un sitio web que comprueban el triunfo de González Urrutia, pero el gobierno de Maduro sostiene que se trata de material plagado de inconsistencias.
