Según demostró esta, habría pasado las fiestas de forma muy íntima con amigos y familia, entre ellos, sus tres hijos.\n“Mi Navidad más feliz en 32 años. No faltaba ni sobraba nadie. Jamás me cansaré de agradecer a Dios por todos los momentos que me hace vivir”, escribió la China Suárez en su cuenta de Instagram , posteo donde compartió una serie de fotos junto a sus mejores amigos y diversos integrantes de su familia, tales como sus hijos Rufina, Magnolia y Amancio.\nPero ese posteo no fue el único que la China Suárez compartió sobre la Navidad, ya que luego sumó un nuevo mensaje. “Desde que tengo uso de razón le pido a Papá Noel, a Dios, al universo ser madre. Pedí hijos y perros en cada carta todos los 24. Pedí y sigo pidiendo salud y amor… mucho amor. Diosito, te escribo para decirte que te pasaste. Gracias“, expresó.\nRumores de romance entre la China Suárez y Mauro Icardi En Intrusos (América TV) dieron a conocer: «La China e Icardi juntos este fin de semana en Tequila, el lugar elegido por ellos hace tiempo para encontrarse. La China Suárez no estaba sola, estaba con Valentina Zenere, pareja de Sebastián Ortega, protagonista de En el barro, la serie que protagoniza la China en la segunda temporada. La China y Mauro a los besos y toqueteos».\n«Bailando juntos y toqueteándose. La gente que estaba alrededor no podía creer que estén en este lugar donde se maximiza todo, otra vez en Tequila. Estaban todos sorprendidos, ellos estaban en el VIP juntos y bailando. Después se fueron a San Jorge, a la casa de ella. Pasaron el fin de semana juntos. Las hijas de Mauro estuvieron con la China», agregaron.",

    "text": "Student Swap Shop returns to encourage sustainable behaviour Vita Student in Exeter, located at Portland House, is thrilled to announce the return of the Vita Student Swap Shop, an initiative that aims to encourage sustainable behaviour, increasing the lifecycle of products and reducing waste for students. The average amount of waste thrown away by each person in the UK is 409kg each year*, meaning the average person is having a significant impact on the environment. The Vita Student Swap Shop will teach the next generation about the significance of giving their items a second lease of life and help to reduce the impact on the environment, to take with them in their life beyond university. Students will be able to donate and pick up everything from course textbooks to clothing. Helping students pick up necessities for life at university for free from their peers and also easing the cost to study. Max Bielby, Chief Operating Officer at Vita Student said: “Thinking about ways we can live more sustainably and adopt environmentally friendly behaviours is really important. The Vita Student Swap Shop was incredibly successful last year with residents passing on old course books, clothing and even soft furnishing, now with a fresh intake of residents, the swap shop returns to encourage this more sustainable way of living.” The Vita Student Swap Shop is currently only open to Vita Student and is located in the foyer of the building.

    "text": "The investigation is focusing on an incident in New London County on Thursday, Dec. 21 that resulted in the death of 42-year-old Vaughn Malloy and State Police K9 Broko, the Office of the Inspector General announced on Wednesday, Dec. 27.\nAccording to officials, around 7:30 p.m. on the day of the incident, the State Police Violent Crime Task Force had been attempting to execute an arrest warrant for Malloy, a Black man, at 69 Mechanic St. in Pawcatuck. The warrant was for assault charges in connection with an April 2022 shooting in Norwich during which Malloy had allegedly fired a shot that struck a woman, officials said.\nWhile executing the search warrant, which was obtained on the day of the incident, troopers ordered Malloy to come out of the house and surrender several times. After he refused to comply, authorities breached the residence's front door with an extended ram attached to the front of an armored vehicle, according to the Inspector General's Office.\nAt this point, Malloy left the residence through a rear door into a backyard where Tactical Unit members were positioned. They soon saw that he was holding a pistol and ordered him to stop, but Malloy instead ran east to avoid arrest, officials said.\nAs he ran to Mechanic Street, K9 Broko was deployed to apprehend him as Tactical Unit members shot him with two \"less lethal impact munitions.\" This caused Malloy to fall to the ground, where he was engaged by Broko. During the struggle, Malloy allegedly fired several shots at the dog and troopers, killing Broko and hitting a police cruiser.\nThis prompted Sergeant Sean Paddock and Troopers Gregory Fascendini, Christopher Church, and Jarred Bolduc to return fire, hitting Malloy several times. He was soon taken to Lawrence Memorial Hospital in New London and later died as a result of his gunshot wounds, officials said.\nMalloy's death was later confirmed to be caused by gunshot wounds to the torso and extremities by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which has not yet issued Malloy's death certificate or toxicological report.\nFootage of the incident taken from body cameras worn by Church and Bolduc was later released by the Inspector General's Office.\nThe investigation into the incident, which is being conducted by The Office of Inspector General, the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, Connecticut State Police Eastern District Major Crime Squad, the Stonington Police Department, and the New London Judicial District State’s Attorney's Office, is still ongoing.\nThis continues to be a developing story.
