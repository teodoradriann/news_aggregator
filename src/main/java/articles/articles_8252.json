    "text": "A comet just discovered last year by observers will whizz past Earth from 44 million miles away but leave a trail of dust and gases visible to the naked eye, NASA said. Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas will make its closest approach to Earth on Saturday and won't be back for about 80,000 years, the space agency said. It is about two miles in diameter and its tail extends millions of miles. Bill Cooke, of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the comet will appear in the sky like a fireball. \"It's not going to zing across the sky like a meteor,\" Cooke said, according to CNN. \"It will just appear to hang there, and it will slowly change position from night to night. If you can see [the comet] with your unaided eye, [using] the binoculars will knock your socks off.\" It was discovered by the Purple Mountain Observatory in China and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, ATLAS, telescope in South Africa. Scientists believe the comet was formed from the Oort Cloud, a spherical shell that surrounds the solar system. \"Bright comets are very rare and are usually newcomers to the inner solar system,\" Cooke said.",

    "text": "[state news](//scroll.in/topic/55654/state-news)\nMadhya Pradesh: Four arrested for allegedly killing cow, homes razed\nHindutva groups had staged a protest demanding that the homes of the four accused persons be demolished.\nAuthorities in Madhya Pradesh’s Agar Malwa district on Tuesday razed the homes of persons accused of harming a cow earlier this week. The cow subsequently\ndied from the injuries.\nOn Monday, four men, identified as Durga Shankar Gujjar, Rahul Gujjar, Razzaq Khan and Sonu Mansuri, allegedly assaulted a cow near the district’s Sangakhedi village. The cow had reportedly damaged their crops.\nSatyendra Bairwa, the deputy collector of the district, told Scroll that a first information report was filed in the Barod police station under Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. They have been arrested.\nThe alleged killing of the cow triggered widespread protests by Hindutva groups. The protestors had\nblocked a highway for more than four hours during their protest, Siasat reported. They demanded that the homes of the four persons be demolished.\nA day later, the houses of at least three accused were partially demolished.\nHowever, Bairwa claimed that the demolitions were in connection with a separate case of illegal construction and that the action was not linked to the first information report against them for alleged cruelty against the cow.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend of civic authorities in Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states demolishing ostensibly illegal properties of those accused of crime. There are no provisions in Indian law that provide for demolishing property as a punitive measure.\nAlso read:\nWhy isn’t India’s judiciary acting to stop the spate of illegal demolitions across the country?

Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home,’ State Rep. Steve Xiarhos wrote in a tribute Published |Updated\nZachary Rogers\nHundreds gathered to honor Army Veteran Charles “Charlie” Connolly. State Representative Steve Xiarhos/Facebook\nDozens of strangers and one long-lost friend gathered Friday to honor a Vietnam veteran who has passed away after battling terminal cancer alone.\nArmy Veteran Charles “Charlie” Connolly, 78, was homeless and had no family at the time of his death on Dec. 18, according to Massachusetts State Rep. Steve Xiarhos. For that reason, the public was invited to attend Connolly’s funeral at the Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne. “Hundreds” showed up, Xiarhos says.\n“Charlie’s story is a powerful reminder of the challenges many of our veterans face after their service,” Xiarhos said in a Facebook post. “His journey, marked by courage and resilience, ended in the compassionate care of the Veterans Affairs Hospice Unit in Brockton. Despite the lack of family by his side, Charlie’s spirit was never alone.”\nXiarhos, who says he is a Gold Star father, adds that he understands “the pain of loss and the importance of remembrance.”\n“My own journey of grief has taught me that we, as a community, must be the family for those who have none,” Xiarhos added. “In honoring Charlie, we not only pay tribute to his life and service but also uphold our duty to support and remember every veteran who has served our nation.”\nConnolly was buried in the state’s national cemetery among 78,000 other heroes in what was a full military funeral according to the state representative. After hearing about Connolly’s passing and funeral on the local news, an old friend of the veteran was able to reach out and attend the service, even receiving Connolly’s burial flag, Boston 25 News reports.\n“As we laid Charlie to rest in this hallowed grounds… let his memory be a beacon that guides our actions in supporting our veterans,” Xiarhos said in his post. “May God bless Charlie Connolly, and all who took the time to Stand for Charlie. Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home.”\nView post on Twitter",
