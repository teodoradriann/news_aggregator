    "text": "Minnesota has quickly become a case study for the disastrous effects of the Covid response, including how government programs facilitated brazen fraud, how criminals use tribalism to deflect accountability, and how Americans are now poorer and less safe than five years ago.\nThe DOJ has charged 70 defendants in a fraud scheme in which the perpetrators allegedly stole $250 million from Covid relief funds. While the defendants were supposed to use the money to serve meals to children, prosecutors allege that they created fake invoices for meals and then laundered the money through shell companies, passport frauds, and illegal kickbacks.\nOn Tuesday, a juror in the case was dismissed after she revealed that someone offered a bag of $120,000 in cash in exchange for a vote for acquittal. “There’s another bag for her if she votes to acquit,” the offeror allegedly said .\nNearly all of the defendants are Somalian, as was the woman who offered the cash to the juror. Their lawyers now seek to exploit diversity politics in their defense strategy.\nPaul Martin Vaaler served as an expert witness on “diaspora businesses” for the defendants. Vaaler testified that the payments reflect immigrants’ “preference for doing [business] outside the gaze of the government.”\nVaaler used this reasoning to support the Defendants’ poor bookkeeping and excessive cash transfers. Vaaler said the millions of dollars transferred back to Somalia could be considered “remittances.” “It’s the best foreign aid in the world because it doesn’t go through government,” Vaaler testified.\nNow, the Minnesota courtroom risks spiraling into a Somalian judicial system – a country with the worst corruption in the world according to Transparency International – with cash bribes and juror intimidation.\nThis institutional unraveling is the direct result of the government’s Covid response. Minnesota, led by Governor Tim Walz, was at the forefront of Covid lockdowns. The state of emergency declared on March 13, 2020 did not end until July 1, 2021. In those fifteen months, Governor Walz shut down schools, jailed dissidents , and closed businesses. His actions spawned the relief efforts that resulted in widespread fraud.\nBeginning in May 2020, Minnesota was also ground zero for the George Floyd riots . Just three miles away from the federal courthouse hosting the Covid fraud trial, rioters set fire to Minneapois’s Third Precinct police building. Looters robbed the evidence room, and thousands celebrated as the building burned after the mayor ordered the police inside to flee.\nLast week, the city purchased land to rebuild the third precinct for $10 million. As Minneapolis led the charge to “defund the police,” crime skyrocketed . Murder increased by 58%, arson increased by 54%, robberies increased by 26%, and aggravated assault increased by 25%.\nMinnesotans’ quality of life declined across the board. A 2022 study found that Minnesota’s government policy responses to Covid-19 cost each family of four nearly $7,500 in lost GDP by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Fewer than half of Minnesota students are proficient in math and reading, and test scores are still 10 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels.\nFrom the rubble of the third precinct to the steps of the federal courthouse, the three-mile strip of downtown Minneapolis represents the Covid response’s assault on Western civilization; how arbitrary and capricious orders spawned widespread corruption and impoverished the citizenry.\nWhen government takes on core tenets of civilized life, such as the right to associate, and presumes the right to manage the whole of private and public life including all civic institutions, under whatever excuse, what you end up with is something other than civilized life. Minnesota is just one case in point but the same afflicts many other places in the country and world, as the fallout from the disaster cascades through our lives.",

[Numerology is an ancient esoteric science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/numerology) that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist [Novalee Wilder](https://www.novaleewilder.com/) shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

Los apresamientos se lograron luego de una operación de gran escala en varios estados lanzada por la policía para “la captura de investigados y condenados vinculados a los hechos” violentos ocurridos una semana después de la toma de posesión del presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Reportes de medios locales indican que algunos de ellos habían inutilizado sus tobilleras electrónicas o incumplieron las órdenes de presentarse ante tribunales. El 8 de enero de 2023, miles de seguidores de Bolsonaro invadieron el palacio presidencial, así como las sedes del Congreso y la Corte Suprema, exigiendo la intervención militar para derrocar a Lula y alegando fraude electoral. Bolsonaro fue interrogado el año pasado por la Policía Federal bajo la sospecha de haber incitado el levantamiento en Brasilia. En el marco de la operación Lesa Patria, la policía arrestó a cientos de presuntos vándalos, financiadores e instigadores de los asaltos. Algunos han sido condenados por delitos como sedición, con penas de hasta 17 años de prisión. “Más de doscientos de ellos violaron deliberadamente medidas cautelares o incluso huyeron a otros países para eludir la justicia”, informó la policía. Recientemente, 49 personas fueron arrestadas en 18 estados y el Distrito Federal, y se busca a otros 159 “condenados o investigados considerados fugitivos”.

    "text": "Nadal no se entrena y su presencia en París 2024 está en duda: «Hay que darle tiempo»\nSu entrenador, Carlos Moyà, ha señalado que están a la espera, «con tratamiento y descansando»\nEl tenista español Rafa Nadal decidió parar este jueves con sus entrenamientos en París después de terminar el miércoles con una molestia en su pierna derecha, poniendo en duda su participación en los\nJuegos Olímpicos, como confirmó su entrenador Carlos Moyà.\n«Hoy se ha decidido descansar para darle más tiempo para recuperar ese contratiempo que se hizo ayer. Estamos a la espera, con tratamiento y descansando. Hay que darle tiempo», dijo este jueves Moyà en una entrevista con Radio Nacional de España, recogida por Europa Press.\nMoyà reconoció esa incertidumbre sobre la participación de Nadal en los Juegos, aunque confió en que pueda estar en el dobles junto a Carlos Alcaraz el sábado, como un buen «test» menos exigente que el individual. «No es un problema que tenga que descartar poder jugar, pero todas las molestias que pueda tener Rafa hay que cogerlas con pinzas e ir con cuidado. Le hace mucha ilusión jugar estos Juegos Olímpicos evidentemente y antes de forzar y que empeore vamos a descansar para tratar estar en las mejores condiciones el sábado. No puedo asegurar que va a jugar ni que no va a jugar», afirmó.\n«El dobles puede ser un buen test, no sólo test porque sus ilusiones son altas, pero sería una buena progresión empezar en el dobles, ver cómo está, y poder empezar el domingo», añadió.\nMoyà lamentó el contratiempo de un Nadal que venía de hacer final en Bastad y que tenía desde «hace muchos años señalado en el calendario» Paris 2024, tras perderse Tokyo 2020. El de Manacor tiene además el bonito reto de competir junto a Alcaraz en un dobles «muy representativo del tenis español». «Le genera mucha ilusión ese dobles con Alcaraz, es algo histórico», apuntó.\nPor otro lado, Moyà confesó que sabían el riesgo de medirse contra un favorito, sin poder estar en el lado del cuadro que Alcaraz y con su ranking, como finalmente sucedió, con Novak Djokovic en su posible cruce de segunda ronda si finalmente salta a la pista y supera el domingo al húngaro Marton Fucsovics.\n«Es el riesgo que había, podía pasar. Lo aceptamos. Sería un reto bonito también si llega a suceder. Estamos lejos de eso todavía, vamos más que nunca día a día», confesó, confirmando de nuevo que la presencia de Nadal en Paris 2024 está en el aire.",

    "text": "Brighten the beach : Beaches can be a bit of a mess after the Fourth of July. Almost as if by coincidence, Turtle Island Restoration Network — the nonprofit behind the whimsical Turtles About Town sculptures all over the island — is sponsoring an island-wide cleanup on Friday morning. Check-in begins at 8:30 a.m. at Menard Park, 2228 28th St., with cleanup from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.; weighing the trash and returning materials is set for 10:30-11:30. Specific cleanup sites will be assigned upon registration, split into three areas: East End, seawall and West End. (Yes, you get to choose.) After the trash is all weighed, a post-cleanup social hour kicks off at noon at Galveston Island Brewing , 8423 Stewart Road. Registration and more details at seaturtles.org/july5 .\nCherry bomb : A fast-talking, Tupperware-hawking, flame-haired spitfire in high heels, Dixie Longate has a relentless desire to entertain and an unquenchable need to cut her audience in on the best possible deal on all sorts of plastic storage containers. Since “emerging” from a Mobile, Alabama trailer park in 2001, Dixie — the drag persona of playwright Kris Andersson — has sold more than 170,000 tickets on stages worldwide and a heckuva lot of Tupperware along the way. This weekend, however, she’ll be trying something new: her first-ever standup show, “Cherry Bombs and Bottle Rockets,” which promises to touch on everything from UFOs to “pogo-sticking” in Dixie’s inimitable style. (Note: not suitable for those under age 16.) Appropriate for the long holiday weekend, Longate will be here for two star-spangled performances at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday at The Grand 1894 Opera House , 2020 Postoffice St. Tickets start at $25; visit thegrand.com for details.",

Ici, des centaines de milliers de soudanais se sont installés dans des camps de fortune, sur des kilomètres carrés. Ils sont revenus se réfugier au Tchad afin d’échapper à la guerre qui frappe leur pays. À bord, Pierre-Yves Scotto coordonne l’aide humanitaire dans le pays pour l’Union européenne.\nLe camp grossit chaque jour \" Chaque fois, le camp grossit. Il n’y a pas assez de moyens pour répondre à tout ça. Il y a encore beaucoup de personnes qui sont complètement démunies, qui n’ont pas reçu assez d’assistance. Elles sont extrêmement traumatisées à cause des violences que les civils subissent dans ce conflit-là \", commente-t-il. Au poste-frontière, une colonne de charrettes arrive du Soudan. Plusieurs centaines de réfugiés arrivent chaque jour, surtout des femmes et des enfants.\nUne famille marche depuis deux jours, avec deux nourrissons de quelques semaines.

(…) Tout le monde a souffert et continue à souffrir. Les gens ont soif, ils ont faim. C’était intenable \", confie une femme.

La partie a été de longue haleine pour venir à bout du joueur russe après quatre heures et 25 minutes de jeu. Pavel Kotov, qui fut 50e joueur du monde en juin dernier, 25 ans aussi, croisait la route de Bergs pour la 4e fois après trois confrontations durant l’année 2021. Bergs en avait remporté une et signe désormais une deuxième victoire. Au tour suivant, Bergs affrontera l’Italien Flavio Cobolli (ATP 31) qui s’est imposé face à l’Australien James Duckworth (ATP 70). Goffin aussi qualifié Il n’est pas le seul Belge qualifié en simple. David Goffin était le premier à entrer en piste côté messieurs mardi. Le N.1 belge, 78e mondial, a éliminé le Chilien Alejandro Tabilo, 21e joueur mondial. Le Liégeois de 33 ans a sorti la 22e tête de série en trois manches : 7-6 (9/7), 6-1, 7-5. La rencontre a duré 2h21. Il sera opposé au Français Adrian Mannarino (ATP 42) au deuxième tour. Zizou Bergs évoluera également en double.

    "title": "Is what 3 words better than GPS?",
    "text": "Is what 3 words better than GPS?\nWhat3words offers an alternative to traditional GPS coordinates, providing a simpler and more user-friendly way to communicate and navigate locations. It has its advantages over GPS, but whether it is better depends on individual needs and preferences.\nWhat is criticism of what3words?\nThe main criticism of what3words is that it is controlled by a private business and its software is patented, making it less freely usable compared to GPS coordinates.\nHow accurate is w3w?\nCompared to current street addressing systems, what3words addresses are more accurate as they pinpoint a specific 3m x 3m area. They remain fixed even if buildings or streets are redeveloped, ensuring accuracy.\nWhat is the benefit of using what3words?\nWhat3words addresses are easier to remember, say over the phone, and type. They are designed for speech recognition technology and offer a quicker and easier way to input locations into voice-enabled devices or vehicles.\nDoes anyone use what3words?\nWhat3words is used by individuals, businesses, and NGOs in almost every country worldwide, making it a widely adopted and recognized addressing system.\nDo UK police use what3words?\nOver 80% of UK emergency services, including the police, accept what3words addresses. While some services in other countries also use it, its use is not yet widespread globally. In emergency situations, it is advisable to call 999 and provide the what3words address for accurate location information.\nHow much does it cost to use what3words?\nUsing what3words is free for individuals via the app and online map. However, the company generates revenue by licensing its API to businesses that benefit commercially from using their products.\nHow do you make money with what3words?\nWhat3words monetizes its services by licensing its code for converting what3words addresses into GPS coordinates to businesses. This allows businesses to access what3words functionality through their Public API or Enterprise Suite.\nDoes Google Maps accept what3words?\nWhile Google Maps doesn’t directly integrate what3words, if provided with a what3words location, users can open it in the what3words app and choose to navigate using Google Maps. This allows users to access the exact location in Google Maps and get directions.\nCan I choose my own what3words?\nYes, individuals can choose their own what3words address based on personal preferences or specific points of interest. People often select a combination of words they like or the address of a specific useful location within a 3m x 3m square.\nWhy is what 3 words better than Google Maps?\nWhat3words and Google Maps serve different purposes. While Google Maps is primarily used for navigation and looking up points of interest, what3words excels in providing a simple and precise way to communicate exact locations, making it ideal for voice-enabled devices, phone calls, and typed inputs.\nWhy does my 3 words keep changing?\nIf multiple devices are very close to each other, they may show slight variations in the displayed 3 word addresses. This is because each device may perceive its location slightly differently. The app converts the GPS location into a 3 word address, allowing for minor variations.\nDoes what3words work without phone signal?\nThe what3words app can function without phone signal or data connection. Users can view the location of any what3words address they enter, access satellite mode, and navigate using compass mode. However, phone signal is required to share a what3words address over phone calls or text messages.\nDoes what3words work in the ocean?\nWhat3words offers 3 word addresses for every 3m square in the world’s seas and oceans, available in English and Korean. However, other what3words languages cover land and coastline areas only.\nWho runs what3words?\nWhat3words is owned by its founders, employees, and investors, including Intel Capital, Mercedes-Benz, Sony Innovation Fund, Subaru, Aramex, Deutsche Bahn, Ingka Investments, ITV AdVentures Invest, and Channel 4 Ventures.\nWhat is the longest what3words address?\nAverage what3words addresses consist of 23 characters, but the maximum length can be up to 64 characters. However, before sharing a real address, it is essential to obtain permission and ensure its legitimacy.\nWhat three words to postcode?\nConverting a postcode to a what3words address is not accurate as postcodes represent a larger area compared to the 3m square identified by a what3words address.\nHow do I find a location using what3words?\nTo find a location using what3words, enter a place name or street address into the search bar and verify the correct result. Switch to satellite mode and zoom in until the grid becomes visible. Tapping on a square in the grid reveals its corresponding what3words address. The app also allows users to view their current location.\nWhat is not allowed on Google Maps?\nGoogle Maps has strict guidelines to ensure a positive user experience. Violent or gory content involving people or animals is not allowed on the platform.\nCan you get paid to type words?\nYes, there are various typing jobs available, such as transcribing audio into text, copying information from hard copies into digital format, and data entry. Legitimate companies offer paid opportunities for these tasks.\nHow much money do you make on tick?\nTikTok pays creators around $0.02 to $0.04 for every 1,000 views through its TikTok Creator Fund. However, earnings may vary, and eligibility for the fund is based on specific criteria.\nHow does what3words actually work?\nWhat3words has divided the world into 3m squares and assigned each square a unique three-word address. These words are generated using a mathematical algorithm and remain fixed, ensuring consistency and accuracy in location identification.\nWhy is what three words free?\nWhile what3words offers its app and online map for free, it is important to note that the company is a proprietary business and licenses its services to commercial entities. The app’s accessibility and ease of use contribute to its popularity and adoption.\nIs what3words profitable?\nSince its launch, what3words has been unprofitable and has experienced increasing losses year-on-year. However, the widespread adoption and integration of its addressing system could potentially contribute to future profitability.",

    "text": "Sara Millerey González Borja, una mujer trans de 32 años, residente de Bello, Antioquia, fue brutalmente asesinada y su crimen ha conmocionado a Colombia y a Latinoamérica.\nPUBLICIDAD\nEl ataque incluyó fracturas en sus extremidades y luego aún con vida la abandonaron en la quebrada La García, mientras otras personas grababan este macabro hecho.\nEl crimen ocurrió el domingo 6 de abril de 2025 y ha movilizado a autoridades y colectivos sociales en busca de justicia y una mayor protección para esta población vulnerable.\nIMÁGENES SENSIBLES:\n¿Qué le pasó a Sara Millerey?\nLa mujer trans fue encontrada en un estado crítico aferrada a unas ramas para evitar ser arrastrada por la corriente de la quebrada.\nEl secretario de Seguridad de Bello, José Rolando Serrano, las versiones apuntan a que bandas delincuenciales podrían estar involucradas en el ataque.\nAdemás,se mencionó que algunos testigos de la escena fueron intimidados por los agresores para evitar que prestaran ayuda.\n“Vea, aquí no se paren, vea. No se paren, aquí, vea”, se escucha la voz de un hombre. Se cree que es la voz de quien graba. Seguido a esto, una segunda voz, masculina, corea la indicación “vea, vea, aquí no se paren mal paridos, vea lo que pasa”.\nPUBLICIDAD\nEn el audio también se alcanza a percibir una tercera voz que solo dice “ay ay aya, ya”.\nAunque fue rescatada por bomberos y trasladada a un centro médico, Sara no sobrevivió a las graves heridas sufridas durante el ataque.\nTestimonios reveladores y contexto de violencia\nEn un video ampliamente difundido, que ha sido calificado como revictimizante por organizaciones de derechos LGBTIQ+, se observa a Sara en sus últimos momentos de vida, mientras los agresores grababan su agonía.\nEn el audio del video, se escuchan varias voces masculinas, lo que sugiere que hubo personas que registraron el violento hecho y desalentaron la intervención de quienes pasaban por el lugar.\nEste crimen ha activado un grupo especial de investigación liderado por la Fiscalía, la Policía y la Sijín.\nAunque no se cuenta con grabaciones del momento exacto del ataque, las autoridades están analizando las cámaras de seguridad cercanas en un esfuerzo por identificar a los responsables.\nAdemás, la Gobernación de Antioquia y la Alcaldía de Bello han ofrecido una recompensa de 100 millones de pesos colombianos (aproximadamente USD 25,000) por información que conduzca a la captura de los responsables.\nReacción de las autoridades y medidas de protección\nEl presidente Gustavo Petro ha solicitado a la Policía Nacional que priorice la investigación, mientras que el Ministerio de Igualdad ha activado la Mesa de Casos Urgentes para fortalecer la investigación bajo un enfoque de derechos humanos. Este enfoque es esencial para asegurar que la violencia contra la comunidad LGBTIQ+ sea combatida de manera efectiva.\nLa Alcaldía de Bello también ha tomado contacto con la familia de Sara, quienes, devastados por la tragedia, exigen justicia en este momento de profunda consternación.",
