    "text": "Phayao abbot leaves monkhood after photos with partner emerge\nA well-known abbot and subdistrict head monk in Mueang district, Phayao province, has left the monkhood following the circulation of photos showing him dining with his male partner.\nThe incident, which took place in Phetchabun province, led to significant public attention. Yesterday morning, February 19, the abbot completed the formal process of leaving the monkhood and departed from the temple, with no information available on his subsequent whereabouts.\nAs news spread, many locals gathered at the temple to check on the temple’s belongings, since the abbot was the only monk residing there. It was confirmed that he did not take any possessions with him, reported KhaoSod.\nResidents expressed regret over the abbot’s departure, as he had significantly contributed to the temple’s development during his tenure.\nThe incident is believed to have been a momentary lapse in judgment, which resulted in these events.\nLast year, police in Surat Thani apprehended a monk, acting as an abbot of a renowned temple, for indecent acts against six young boys. During their search, they discovered sex enhancement drugs in his room. The monk confessed before being charged with multiple offences.\nAt 12.30am on November 20 last year, Police Colonel Paisan Sangthep, Deputy Commander of Surat Thani Provincial Police, alongside Police Colonel Pornnarong Kanorachai and a team from Phrasaeng Police Station, arrested 44 year old Chaturaphat. He was the head of a temple in Phrasaeng district, Surat Thani.\nCommunity leaders had previously alerted the police about his inappropriate behaviour towards young novice monks and boys aged between 11 and 13, revealed Pol. Col. Pornnarong.\n“On the evening of November 19 last year, community leaders informed us of Chaturaphat’s improper sexual conduct. We immediately dispatched officers alongside community leaders to investigate the claims.”\nUpon investigation, Chaturaphat confessed to having engaged in indecent acts with the young boys from April to October last year.\nLatest Thailand News\nThailand News",

    "text": "Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday at Boeing factories near Seattle and elsewhere after union members voted overwhelmingly to go on strike and reject a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years.The strike started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, less than three hours after the local branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced 94.6% of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing a two-thirds requirement.The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in Washington state, and is expected to shut down production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. The strike will not affect commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing problems and multiple federal investigations this year.The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling airliner, along with the 777, or \"triple-seven\" jet, and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by nonunion workers in South Carolina.Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading, \"Historic contract my ass\" and \"Have you seen the damn housing prices?\" Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister’s \"We’re Not Gonna Take It\" and Taylor Swift’s \"Look What You Made Me Do.\"The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year contract, according to Boeing.However, the deal fell short of the union’s initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an increase in new Boeing contributions of up to $4,160 per worker to employee 401(k) retirement accounts.Under the rejected contract, workers would have received $3,000 lump sum payments and a reduced share of health care costs. Boeing also had met a key union demand by agreeing to build its next new plane in Washington state.Several workers said they considered the wage offer inadequate and were upset by a recent company decision to change the criteria on which annual bonuses are paid. Toolmaker John Olson, 45, said he has received a 2% percent raise during his six years at Boeing. \"The last contract we negotiated was 16 years ago and the company is basing the wage increases off of wages from 16 years ago,\" Olson said. \"They don’t even keep up with the cost of inflation that is currently happening right now.\"Boeing responded to the strike announcement by saying it was \"ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\"\"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,\" the company said in a statement.Very little has gone right for Boeing this year, from a panel blowing out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather sending them home on a problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft.As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That will be another challenge for new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European rival Airbus.Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to salvage a deal that had unanimous backing from the union’s negotiators. He told machinists Wednesday that \"no one wins\" in a walkout and a strike would put Boeing’s recovery in jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its airline customers.\"For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,\" he said. \"Working together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.\"The head of the union local, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden, said Ortberg faced a difficult position because machinists were bitter about stagnant wages and concessions they have made since 2008 on pensions and health care to prevent the company from moving jobs elsewhere.\"This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" Holden said in announcing the strike.The vote also was a rebuke to Holden and union negotiators, who recommended workers approve the contract offer. Holden, who had predicted workers would vote to strike, said the union would survey members to decide which issues they want to stress when negotiations resume.Depending on how long the strike lasts, suspension of airplane production could prove costly for the beleaguered Boeing. An eight-week strike in 2008, the longest at Boeing since a 10-week walkout in 1995, cost the company about $100 million daily in deferred revenue.Before the tentative agreement was announced Sunday, Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a strike would cost the company about $3 billion based on the 2008 strike plus inflation and current airplane-production rates.Solomon Hammond, 33, another Renton toolmaker, said he was prepared to strike indefinitely to secure a better contract.Boeing&apos;s offer \"just doesn’t line up with the current climate. The wages are just too low,\" Hammond said. \"I make $47 an hour and work paycheck to paycheck. Everything costs more.\" Green River Killer Gary Ridgway booked into King County Jail How much does it really cost to go to the WA State Fair?

    "title": "After Rise in Murders During the Pandemic, a Sharp Decline in 2023 – DNyuz",
    "text": "Detroit is on track to record the fewest murders since the 1960s. In Philadelphia, where there were more murders in 2021 than in any year on record, the number of homicides this year has fallen more than 20 percent from last year. And in Los Angeles, the number of shooting victims this year is down more than 200 from two years ago.\nThe decrease in gun violence in 2023 has been a welcome trend for communities around the country, though even as the number of homicides and the number of shootings have fallen nationwide, they remain higher than on the eve of the pandemic.\nIn 2020, as the pandemic took hold and protests convulsed the nation after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, the United States saw the largest increase in murders ever recorded. Now, as 2023 comes to a close, the country is likely to see one of the largest — if not the largest — yearly declines in homicides, according to recent F.B.I. data and statistics collected by independent criminologists and researchers.\nThe rapid decline in homicides isn’t the only story. Among nine violent and property crime categories tracked by the F.B.I., the only figure that is up over the first three quarters of this year is motor vehicle theft. The data, which covers about 80 percent of the U.S. population, is the first quarterly report in three years from the F.B.I., which typically takes many months to release crime data.\nThe decline in crime contrasts with perceptions, driven in part by social media videos of flash-mob-style shoplifting incidents, that urban downtowns are out of control. While figures in some categories of crime are still higher than they were before the pandemic, crime overall is falling nationwide, including in cities often singled out by politicians as plagued by danger and violence. Homicides are down by 13 percent in Chicago and by 11 percent in New York, where shootings are down by 25 percent — two cities that former President Donald J. Trump called “ crime dens ” in a campaign speech this year.\nJust as criminologists attributed the surge in murders in 2020 and 2021 to the disruptions of the pandemic and protests — including the isolation, the closing of schools and social programs and the deepening distrust of the police — they attribute the recent drop in crime to the pandemic’s sliding into the rearview mirror.\n“Murder didn’t go up because of things that happened in individual neighborhoods or individual streets,” said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans who tracks homicides in nearly 180 American cities. “It went up because of these big national factors, and I think the big national factors are probably driving it down. The biggest of which is probably Covid going to the background.”\nIn a country awash in guns, the normal that many cities are returning to is still a violent one, with the biggest still enduring hundreds of fatal shootings a year. And some cities are bucking the positive trend, including Washington, where the murder toll continues a grim multiyear climb. The homicide tally this year is the highest in two decades , and there have been more than 900 carjacking incidents .\nWashington is an exception this year even in the Mid-Atlantic region. Baltimore is on track to report the fewest murders in nearly a decade , and Philadelphia to post a homicide count more than 25 percent below its 2021 record of 562 .\nSeveral community activists in Philadelphia attributed the surge of violence in recent years to the sudden vacuum of civic resources at the onset of the pandemic. “We got to see what happens when there are no programs available,” said Jonathan Wilson, who runs the Fathership Foundation , a nonprofit in southwest Philadelphia.\nSchools, recreation centers and libraries were closed, and grass-roots groups like his were not equipped to fill the gaps. But the city’s budget last year included more than $150 million for anti-violence efforts , some of it in the form of grants to organizations that could match teenagers with jobs or provide safe places for students after school.\nThe city of Detroit is on track to record the lowest number of homicides since 1966, a remarkable milestone even given its substantially smaller population today. Local officials credited an aggressive effort to jump-start the criminal justice system, which had largely stalled in the pandemic.\n“We know why violent crime soared in America,” said Mayor Mike Duggan at a news conference this month. “The criminal courts shut down. You couldn’t put 12 jurors in a room.”\nChief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department said that while he was encouraged to see such steady declines in violent crime — murder and rape are down markedly and robbery is down slightly this year — the city was struggling with property crime. Burglaries, car thefts and personal theft are all up substantially.\nIn Los Angeles, much of the decline in murders comes from a drop in the number of killings of homeless people; in both 2021 and 2022, more than 90 homeless people were killed, according to Crosstown , a nonprofit news outlet. So far this year, 35 fewer homeless people have been killed, a 55 percent reduction, according to Chief Moore. While the trend is encouraging, he said, violence in L.A., like in many cities, is still up compared with just before the pandemic.\n“We still have far too much violence and we have more work to do when we look at the pre-Covid period,” he said.\nThe post After Rise in Murders During the Pandemic, a Sharp Decline in 2023 appeared first on New York Times .",
