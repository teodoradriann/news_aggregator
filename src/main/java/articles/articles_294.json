    "text": "Sky has said around 2,000 jobs are at risk as part of an overhaul of its call centres.\nThe company, which owned by US media giant Comcast, has said it plans to shut three of its 10 current UK call centres, in Stockport, Sheffield and central Leeds.\nMore than 300 jobs are also affected at Sky’s call centre site in Dunfermline.\nIt said around 7% of its overall workforce would be affected by the shake-up.\nThe company said the changes will “create a faster, smarter and more responsive experience” for customers and help support investment plans by the entertainment and telecommunications firm.\nHowever, Sky also announced on Thursday that it is making a “multimillion-pound investment” in its Livingston site to establish a “centre of excellence”.\nIt told staff it is making the changes to its operations in order to help the firm “adapt to an increasingly digital world”, with customers increasingly interacting with it online.\nA spokesman for the company said: “We’re transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler and more digital customer service.\n“Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally.\n“We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable, and available 24/7.”\nIt comes after Sky launched plans last January to cut around 1,000 jobs, axing a raft of engineers amid weaker demand for satellite dish installations.\nDon't miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter - sign up here for free.",

    "text": "7 Reasons Why You Should Never Retire to a Cruise Ship\nHave you ever heard of people retiring and living on a cruise ship full-time? Believe it or not, it happens. And more than you might think.\nWhile some may consider traveling the world on a floating city for their golden years, retiring to a cruise ship might not be the idyllic lifestyle it appears to be at first glance.\nLet's explore seven reasons why choosing a cruise ship as a retirement haven may not be the best idea.\nWhy You Shouldn't Retire to a Cruise Ship\nLimited Personal Space\nOne of the key drawbacks of\nliving on a cruise ship during retirement is the limited personal space.\nSure, you have the entire cruise ship to roam, but that isn't private space. Cruise cabins are compact, offering minimal room for personal belongings and activities.\nFor individuals accustomed to spacious homes, downsizing to a cabin can feel confining and hinder one's ability to lead a comfortable and fulfilling life. Over time, the lack of personal space can lead to claustrophobia and frustration, negating the very purpose of a relaxing retirement.\nContinuous Mobility\nCruise ships are designed to move, and retirees residing in these floating homes must adapt to a lifestyle characterized by constantly moving around. For a while, this constant motion might be fine. But over time, it could become annoying.\nWhile the idea of waking up to a new destination every day may seem appealing initially, the reality is that this continuous movement can lead to seasickness, disrupt daily routines, and make it challenging to establish a sense of stability and routine, crucial for a fulfilling retirement.\nAnd once you're on the ship, permanently getting off the boat without hassle and expense is difficult.\nLimited Social Connections\nContrary to popular belief, despite their bustling social environments, cruise ships may not offer the ideal setting for meaningful and lasting social connections.\nAfter all, making good friends takes time.\nFellow passengers are transient, leading to fleeting friendships that may lack depth and sincerity. Additionally, the ship's staff turnover can limit the development of genuine relationships with crew members.\nFor a truly fulfilling retirement, it's essential to have stable and meaningful social connections, which might be challenging to achieve in the transient environment of a cruise ship.\nHealthcare Concerns\nWhile cruise ships have medical facilities, relying on them for healthcare during retirement may not be ideal, depending on your health needs.\nMedical resources on board are limited, and accessing specialized care can be problematic in case of a serious health issue. The proximity to quality healthcare facilities becomes crucial as one age, making retirement on a cruise ship a risky choice for those with existing health concerns or anticipating future medical needs.\nIf you need medical attention in the middle of a sea passage, you might be rushed to a hospital via helicopter, which will be expensive and will take time to get you to a hospital.\nFinancial Considerations\nRetiring to a cruise ship might seem financially savvy, as it covers one package of accommodation, food, and entertainment. However, hidden costs can quickly add up.\nOnboard expenses, maintenance fees, and the potential for fluctuating cruise prices can strain a retiree's budget. It's crucial to consider the long-term financial implications and the sustainability of funding such a lifestyle throughout retirement, as unexpected expenses can arise without warning.\nLack of Cultural Engagement\nLiving on a cruise ship may limit retirees' exposure to diverse cultures and experiences.\nWhile cruise ship itineraries include various ports of call, the time spent in each destination is often brief. This limitation can hinder the opportunity to immerse oneself in the local culture, build connections with the community, and truly appreciate the richness of different societies.\nA fulfilling retirement often involves meaningful cultural engagement, which the transient nature of cruise ship living may compromise. In other words, you probably won't be in one place long enough to experience everything it offers.\nLegal and Logistical Challenges\nRetiring on a cruise ship presents unique legal and logistical challenges.\nDetermining legal residency, managing finances across international waters, and dealing with potential legal issues can be complex and stress-inducing. Navigating these challenges can become burdensome and impact the overall retirement experience.\nMaintaining a stable legal and logistical foundation is important for a worry-free retirement, something that the complexities of cruise ship living may compromise.\nIn conclusion, while retiring on a cruise ship may initially seem like an adventurous and carefree option, the practical realities of this lifestyle choice paint a different picture.\nFrom limited personal space and continuous mobility to healthcare concerns and financial considerations, there are several reasons to think twice before making a cruise ship your retirement home.\nUltimately, a successful retirement is about finding a balance between comfort, stability, and meaningful connections – elements that may be challenging to achieve in the transient environment of a cruise ship.",

    "text": "Griffith University's BioSpine team, led by [Dr Claudio Pizzolato](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/7820-claudio-pizzolato), has won a coveted place in a health tech accelerator program that drives commercialisation of start-up technologies in the [Gold Coast Health and Knowledge Precinct](https://gchkp.com.au/) (GCHKP). Dr Pizzolato will join the intensive 14-week [LuminaX](https://lxhealth.com.au/) (LX) program, together with BioSpine Coordinator Kyle Mullholland and with support from co-investigator Dr Dinesh Palipana OAM, Griffith's commercialisation office, Griffith Enterprise, and an almost 30-strong multi-disciplinary [GCORE](https://www.griffith.edu.au/menzies-health-institute-queensland/our-research/disability-and-rehabilitation/gcore) research team, who continue to advance the novel rehabilitation technology through a second round of clinical studies. LuminaX helps validate and commercialise early-stage, high-growth activities applying tech or AI solutions to healthcare, medtech and wellness, and draws start-ups from around Australia through a competitive application process. BioSpine is a digitally-enabled rehabilitation system for spinal cord injury (SCI) that brings together non-invasive technologies - assistive exercise devices, electrical stimulation, a brain computer interface that uses AI to help interpret a participant's intention to move and virtual reality to create an immersive rehab environment, all controlled through an advanced digital twin. Through coordinating this powerful combination of technologies, BioSpine seeks to harness neuroplasticity to stimulate residual neurons in paralysed individuals and restore sensory and motor function. As research and clinical studies progress, Dr Pizzolato is eager to take a parallel focus on the pathway to translating BioSpine into the clinic through commercial investment. \"We are extremely excited to have been selected for LuminaX,\" Dr Pizzolato said. \"It's a fantastic opportunity to fast-track the translation of our BioSpine technology for every person that might benefit from it. We look forward to building our network by getting to know all the LuminaX mentors and learning how to pitch for investment and scale globally. Our team is backed by Griffith Enterprise (the University's commercialisation arm), a demonstration of the commitment of Griffith to making an impact.\" Last year BioSpine was boosted with a [$3.8m grant from the Queensland Motor Accident Insurance Commission (MAIC),](https://news.griffith.edu.au/2023/07/14/multi-million-dollar-funding-boost-for-biospine/) following initial MAIC funding of over $2.2m in 2019. The grant supports expansion of the protocol to include direct electrical stimulation of the spine, as well as expanded clinical studies across a larger cohort of participants and continued co-development and design with the goal of making BioSpine clinic-ready. Director of Griffith Enterprise Dr Mark Ashton said that while BioSpine is complex 'deep tech', there are a number of different commercial opportunities. \"Bringing BioSpine into widespread clinical practice in a global market is a massive undertaking, however Griffith Enterprise is working closely with the research team to protect intellectual property and seek commercial partners for the technology,\" Dr Ashton said. \"The additional support from the LuminaX program and mentors, access to venture capital networks and the peer support of being part of an entrepreneurial program are really invaluable for the team and our commercialisation efforts. We are excitted to support the BioSpine team through the process.\" Now in its fourth year, the LX program, delivered by [Cohort,](https://cohortspace.com.au/) is supported by Major Partners: Economic Development Queensland, the City of Gold Coast, and Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), alongside Griffith University, Mater Hospital, QLD AI Hub, and IntelliHQ. Backed by the Queensland Venture Capital Development Fund (VCDF) program, participants will have a unique opportunity to connect with some of the largest VC funds and investors in Australia. Griffith University's Vice President of Industry and External Engagement, Professor Bronwyn Harch, said having a successful health tech accelerator in the GCHKP gave researchers easy access to a sophisticated and powerful innovation ecosystem. \"Last year we had [two teams from Griffith University](https://news.griffith.edu.au/2023/08/02/griffith-team-win-top-start-up-award-at-luminax/) participate in LuminaX, both focused on technologies that benefit children,\" Professor Harch said. \"One team. AlignUs, is successfully commercialising surgeries for children with complex hip deformities, supported by Griffith's Advanced Design and Prototyping Technologies Institute (ADaPT), while the team behind YourTrack, which actually won the LuminaX 2023 top award, is rolling out neurodevelopmental assessment tools to help children in remote, Indigenous and disadvantaged communities, and has since secured $6.5m in additional government funding.\" \"These outcomes demonstrate the importance of gaining industry knowledge and connections through innovation programs, and as a leading research initiative, BioSpine has great scope to significantly extend Griffith's impact globally.\" Approximately 20,800 Australians are living with SCI, with 350-400 people sustaining a new injury each year. BioSpine also has potential to help individuals suffering other types of neurotrauma. [here](/spinal-cord-injury-rehab-tech-advances-towards-1213587/).",

    "text": "MUMBAI: The Dharamveer Anand Dighe Saheb Maharashtra Autorickshaw ani Metered Taxi chalak welfare board has set a registration fee of Rs 500 and an annual membership fee of Rs 300. In response, the Mumbai Autorickshaw-Taximens Union submitted a petition to chief minister Eknath Shinde on Friday, expressing their strong opposition to these fees.The union's president, Shashank Rao, stated in the petition: \\\"The auto and taxi drivers observe all rules and they earn their livelihood after working strenuously round the clock ferrying passengers on long and short distance routes. They also incurred huge losses during Covid pandemic and many autos and taxis were off roads during that period. Why are they being asked to pay money to become members of the welfare board?\\\"Rao emphasised that drivers already bear the costs of fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance on a monthly basis. He pointed out that the unions have been advocating for a welfare board for drivers for the past 15 years. While the current government has announced the establishment of such a board, it has not provided details on the benefits that will be offered to drivers and their families. Instead, the government has distributed membership forms and demanded fees, which the union firmly opposes. The union insists that there should be no charges for auto and taxi drivers to join the board.In the petition, the union also put forth several demands, including a pension equal to 30% of average monthly earnings for those above 65 years of age, Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of drivers who lose their lives in accidents, medical insurance of up to Rs 10 lakh for drivers and their family members, and Rs 10 lakh interest-free education loans for the children of auto-taxi drivers.",

    "title": "Noche histórica de calor en Málaga: 34,6 grados",
    "text": "Noche histórica de calor en Málaga: 34,6 grados\nEn 82 años no se había registrado una temperatura tan extrema durante una madrugada en la capital\nOtros puntos de la provincia, como Coín y Torremolinos, también superaron con creces los 30 grados\nOla de calor: Álora, Coín, Alpandeire, Estepona y Cortes de la Frontera 'se cuecen' con más de 40 grados\nCon las ventanas cerradas a cal y canto, y el ventilador o el aire acondicionado encendidos, pocos han sido los afortunados que esta pasada noche han logrado conciliar el sueño en Málaga. Sin piedad, el terral ha hecho de las suyas y a las 02:00 horas la capital marcaba 34,6 grados, registrados en el termómetro del aeropuerto, el que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) toma como referencia para establecer sus registros oficiles. Y según estos registros, desde 1942, año en que comenzaron a tomarse datos, la ciudad no había vivido una madrugada tan calurosa. Récord histórico.\nResulta preocupante, además, que no hace tanto tiempo que se batió el mismo récord, pues la anterior noche más cálida de la historia había sido la del\n2 de julio de 2020, cuando se alcanzaron 31,6 grados. Eso en lo que se refiere a la temperatura más alta alcanzada durante la madrugada. Pero también hay que fijarse en la temperatura mínima nocturna, porque en este apartado se ha registrado la tercera más elevada de la historia: 30,2 grados a las 08:00 horas. Es decir, el pico de calor de la noche se obtuvo a las 02:00 horas y a partir de ahí los termómetros fueron descendiendo hasta los 30,2 de mínima.\nSegún ha señalado el delegado territorial de la Aemet en Andalucía, Juan de Dios Del Pino, los datos recopilados hasta el año 2023 muestran que el verano pasado, que fue extremadamente caluroso, conserva las dos mínimas históricas más altas con 31,6 grados el 20 de julio y con 30,3 grados el 2 de agosto. Hasta esa fecha, la temperatura mínima más alta durante una noche en Málaga se vivio el 3 de agosto de 1949, con 29,4 grados. Hace 75 años. Es más, hasta 2022 las temperaturas nocturnas no habían alcanzado nunca en 78 años los 30 grados en Málaga; y ahora se ha vuelto a rebasar en apenas cuatro años. Se ha superado, además, en más de cinco grados a la noche del 3 de agosto de 1949 (29,4).\n\"El terral tiene esa particularidad, y es un fenómeno muy característico de Málaga\", explica Del Pino, que comenta: \"Málaga va por libre, cuando en el resto de Andalucía hace calor, aquí no; y viceversa\". \"Los terrales pueden dar temperaturas muy disparatadas, pero reales\", añade el meteorólogo, que ha puesto como referencia la temperatura mínima más alta de la historia en una provincia tan calurosa como Sevilla, que es de 29,3 grados, un valor que la capital malagueña ha superado esta noche.\nNoche ecuatorial\nPor tanto, esta ha sido una noche ecuatorial de libro, un término lo que los expertos emplean para denominar a aquella que es más extrema que la tropical, y que se produce cuando las temperatuas nocturnas no descienden de los 26 grados. Pero no solo la han sufrido los malagueños de la capital. Los 34,6 grados del aeropuerto de Málaga no es el único valor de calor sofocante que se ha registrado durante esta madrugada en la provincia, según los datos de la Aemet. La estación del\nCentro Meteorológico de Málaga, ubicada en El Cónsul, alcanzó a la medianoche 32,3 grados; y en otros puntos de la provincia también se superaron con creces los 30 grados. Así, Coín tuvo 33,3 grados a las 01:20 horas, y Torremolinos llegó a los 32,4 grados a las 02:10 horas.\nCon esto, la provincia de Málaga acaparó cuatro de los cinco valores más elevados durante la madrugada en toda España. El otro estuvo en la localidad granadina de Castell de Ferro (33,2).\nÁlora se cuece a 44,3 grados\nY ello después de\nun día verdaderamente sofocante en toda la provincia, especialmente en el Valle del Guadalhorce donde el mercurio se acercó a los 45 grados. En concreto, la temperatura más alta de todo el país este jueves estuvo en Álora, con 44,3 grados a las 16:40 horas; un grado y pico menos (43,1) se registraron en Coín, territorio que siempre le va a la zaga, cuando no acaba por doblegarlo, en este particular ránking, y que en cualquier caso se llevó la medalla de plata a nivel regional a municipio más tórrido.\nTambién por encima de los 40º han pasado la tarde los habitantes de Alpandeire, donde se ha llegado a los 41,4º, mientras que en Estepona los termómetros han firmado 40,7º, muy similar a lo ocurrido en Cortes de la Frontera, con 40,4º. Ligeramente por debajo se han quedado en puntos como Antequera, con 38,4º; Gaucín, con 38,2º; o Ronda, con 37,3º.\nTambién te puede interesar\nLo último\nJosé Rodríguez de la Borbolla\n[]https://www.malagahoy.es/andalucia/deberiamos-votar-espanoles-cambia-constitucion_0_2002157128.html\n\"Deberíamos votar todos los españoles porque se cambia la Constitución\"",
