    "title": "Listen to the Warning: When Jesus Said ‘Depart from Me, I Never Knew You’",
    "text": "In one of the most sobering statements recorded in the Gospels, Jesus Christ warns of a day when many who believed themselves to be followers would be turned away with the words, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” This dire warning, found in\nMatthew 7:23, serves as a crucial lesson on the nature of genuine faith, the importance of a personal relationship with Christ, and the implications of superficial belief. It’s a call to examine our faith’s authenticity, ensuring it’s rooted in a real connection with Jesus rather than merely religious activities or verbal affirmations.\nUnderstanding the Biblical Context of ‘Depart From Me, I Never Knew You’\nThis warning comes at the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven, challenging prevailing religious norms and urging a deeper, more authentic adherence to God’s will. Here, Christ isn’t merely addressing overt sinners or non-believers but those who actively participate in religious activities, even performing miracles in His name. The stark message is that such feats, in the absence of a real relationship with Jesus, are insufficient.\nThe Danger of Superficial Faith\nSuperficial faith refers to a belief that is only skin-deep, where individuals may identify as Christians but lack a\ntransformative connection with Jesus. This form of faith is often built on convenience, cultural identity, or the desire for the benefits of being associated with Christianity without the commitment to its teachings. Jesus warns that simply calling Him “Lord” or engaging in religious activities is not enough for salvation. True faith must penetrate beyond surface-level acknowledgment, fundamentally altering our lives and actions.\nRELATED:\nTim Keller: 3 Questions Fake Christians Can’t Answer\nThe Necessity of a Genuine Relationship\nCentral to Jesus’ message is the desire for a personal, intimate relationship with His followers. Christianity, at its core, is not about adhering to a set of rules or rituals but about knowing and being known by Christ. This relationship is characterized by love, ongoing dialogue (prayer), and a deep knowledge of God’s character as revealed in the Bible. A genuine relationship with Jesus transforms us, influencing our actions, decisions, and how we relate to others and God.\nAuthentic Obedience Over Religious Activity\nAuthentic obedience is a natural outflow of a genuine relationship with Christ. It involves listening to and\nfollowing God’s will as revealed in Scripture, even when it challenges or convicts us. This obedience is not about earning God’s love or salvation—both are freely given—but about living in a way that reflects our love for Him and aligns with His kingdom’s values. In contrast, Jesus criticizes those who perform religious activities for show or without a heart aligned with God’s will, highlighting that true discipleship is marked by doing the Father’s will.\nThe Peril of Lawlessness\nJesus specifically points to those who practice lawlessness, indicating habitual disobedience to God’s commands, as those He does not know. This lawlessness isn’t about occasional failings or sins but a consistent pattern of behavior that rejects God’s authority. It underscores the importance of repentance—a heartfelt turning away from sin and toward God—which is a key aspect of genuine faith. Repentance is not a one-time act but a continuous part of the Christian life, reflecting an ongoing desire to align with God’s will.",

    "text": "On Friday (23rd February), the Supreme Court\ngranted bail to Bhurekhan of Gujarat in a case against him for forcibly converting a Hindu woman belonging to the SC/ST community to Islam. The Supreme Court granted him bail after the Gujarat High Court had denied it, having noted the prima facie involvement of the accused and presence of sufficient evidence against him. The bail of the accused Bhurekhan was denied twice earlier.\nThe\nSupreme Court bench of Justice Abhay S Oka and Justice Ujall Bhuyan observed that there are multiple FIRs filed against the accused in this case. The court also underlined that in the third FIR, the complainant woman claiming to be the wife of the accused has complained against Bhurekhan’s family members as well.\nBREAKING: Supreme Court has granted bail to a Muslim man accused of forcibly converting Hindu woman belonging to SC/ST to Islam & threatening to make viral, an intimate video of her, despite a Gujarat HC finding that there was “sufficient evidence” collected against him & his…— LawBeat (@LawBeatInd)\n[February 23, 2024]\nThe Supreme Court bench said in its order, “The First Information Report (FIR) is registered based on a complaint filed by the first informant who is claiming to be the wife of the appellant. There are three successive FIRs registered against the appellant. In the present FIR, his entire family has been implicated.”\nThe court added, “Considering the facts of the case, the appellant deserves to be enlarged on bail. For that purpose, the appellant shall be produced before the Trial Court within one week from today. The Trial Court shall enlarge the appellant on bail on appropriate terms and conditions.”\nThis decision came in response to the impugned order by the Gujarat High Court on 13th September 2023, ruling that the accused shall not be granted bail. This verdict was pronounced by Justice Hasmukh D Suthar. According to the Gujarat High Court, the probe in this case had revealed ‘sufficient evidence’ against Bhurekhan to deny him bail. The High Court also noted that there was prima facie apparent involvement of the accused in the alleged crime and freeing him on bail may result in the accused tampering with the evidence.\nTwo earlier orders of the High Court and Trial Court, had denied bail to the man, Bhurekhan who allegedly married the woman belonging to SC/ST & compelled her to follow Islam— LawBeat (@LawBeatInd)\n[@LegalTalwar] [February 24, 2024]\nThe Gujarat High Court said, “It is needless to say that after filing the complaint, during the investigation, sufficient material is collected against the present accused and strengthened circumstance is against the present accused and prima facie, it appears that involvement of accused and role attributed to the present applicant in the offence.”\nThe High Court further said, “This Court is of the considered opinion that if the present accused is enlarged on bail, which is nothing but the possibility can be ruled out that accused will misuse his liberty and tamper with witnesses of evidence of the prosecution and the appellant is having criminal antecedents and two offence are also registered against him.”\nAn offence in this case was first registered in 2023 at the Gomtipur police station in Ahmedabad under sections 354, 323, 294(b), 506(2), 143, 147 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sections 3(2)(VA) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. A special court bench of Ahmedabad had also denied bail to the accused Bhurekhan in this case.",

    "text": "An analyst has explained that the outlook for Bitcoin should remain bullish as long as the cryptocurrency’s price remains above this level. Bitcoin Has Strong On-Chain Support Above $41,800 In a new post on X, analyst Ali talked about the various BTC support and resistance levels from an on-chain perspective. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level depends on the amount of Bitcoin that the investors bought at said level. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 76% Lido DAO Rally If This Ascending Triangle Break Happens The chart below shows what the distribution of the different BTC price ranges currently looks like based on the concentration of holder cost basis that they carry. How the various price ranges near the current spot price are looking like in terms of support and resistance | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the $41,800 to $43,100 range hosts the acquisition price of most Bitcoin out of all the price ranges listed. To be more specific, about 2.4 million addresses acquired 1 million BTC within this range. The cost basis is naturally of immense significance for any investor, as the spot price retesting can flip their profit-loss situation. As such, holders become more likely to show some move when a retest like this happens. A holder in profit before the retest might tend to buy more when the retest happens, as they might believe this same level that proved profitable earlier would do so again. On the other hand, loss holders might want to sell at their break-even level since they may fear the cryptocurrency going down again, putting them underwater again. These buying and selling moves aren’t enough to move the market when just a few investors are making them, but if a large number of investors have their cost basis inside a narrow range, the reaction could become significant. Since those above $41,800 to $43,100 range is dense with investors, it should be an essential on-chain range. The spot price is floating above the range so that these prices could act as a support barrier for the asset. Based on this, Ali explains, “as long as Bitcoin maintains its position above $41,800, the outlook remains bullish.” Related Reading: Ethereum Mega Whales Continue To Buy: Do They Know Something You Don’t? The chart shows that the Bitcoin ranges above the price aren’t carrying the cost basis of that many investors. This could imply that there isn’t much resistance ahead for the coin. The analyst notes that this lack of major resistance also strengthens the potential for the cryptocurrency to stay at the current levels or push towards the higher ones.

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "PALENCIA, 6 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n La europarlamentaria socialista y número 2 del PSOE en las elecciones europeas, Iratxe García, cree que es \"muy evidente\" que al PP se le ha \"atragantado\" la campaña y ha \"perdido fuelle\", al tiempo que ha criticado que los 'populares', como \"no tenían programa electoral\", se hayan dedicado a hacer \"rápido y en una noche\" un programa que les \"ha salido mal\" con párrafos repetidos, lo cual evidencia su \"falta de coherencia\" e \"incapacidad\" con la ciudadanía española.\n De esta manera ha calificado el programa electoral del PP la sociaista durante su intervención en un acto de campaña celebrado este jueves en el Parque 'Huerta de Guadián' de Palencia, en el que ha estado acompañada por el secretario general del PSCyL, Luis Tudanca, y la alcaldesa de la capital palentina y secretaria general del PSOE de Palencia, Miriam Andrés.\n A este respecto, García ha asegurado que el Partido Popular \"ha perdido fuelle\", algo que ha sido \"muy evidente\" por lo que se le ha \"atragantado\", lo que pone de manifiesto la \"falta de propuesta y de compromiso de la derecha española con el proyecto europeo\".\n Hace unos días, ha relatado la candidata socialista, un dirigente del Partido Popular, a una pregunta de un medio de comunicación sobre el programa electoral, dijo que \"era secreto y que habían enviado un par de folios con algunos títulos pero que el resto era secreto\".\n En relación con esta cuestión, Iratxe García ha remarcado que un programa electoral es un compromiso que se asume y que la ciudadanía necesita conocer para saber lo \"mucho que se juega este domingo, 9 de junio\". \"Eso yo creo que es muy sintomático del estado del Partido Popular en estos momentos\", ha sostenido la socialista.\nLeer más acerca de: PSOE PP",
