    "title": "Church to Host Easter Sunday Drag Show",
    "text": "The Calgary Unitarian Church is hosting drag queens in their Easter Sunday service. At least four men dressed as women will participate in the church service – a program titled, “Drag Me to Church.” Pastors say the Easter Sunday event is meant to show solidarity with the gay community and to serve as a sacred act of protest. “No matter what tradition you’re from, I guarantee you that you will have people in your community who identify on the 2SLGBTQIA+ spectrum — whether they are free to say it or not,” Rev. Samaya Oakley [told the Edmonton Journal](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/sacred-act-of-protest-drag-show-planned-for-calgary-unitarians-easter-sunday-service#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNo%20matter%20what%20tradition%20you,minister%20of%20the%20Calgary%20Unitarians.). “If we are truly people who believe in the goodness and the inherent love that exists in this world, then we would extend that to people on that spectrum.” But there’s nothing sacred about drag queens desecrating the sanctity of the church house. This year Easter Sunday falls on the same day as International Transgender Day of Visibility. The Unitarians say they plan to pass the offering plate to raise money for a program that supports men who think they are women. The all-ages Easter service will feature drag performances, a drag queen storytime, and multiple speakers addressing the question, “What does TRANSformation mean today?” “One of our principles is the inherent worth and dignity of every person,” Oakley said. “And that’s where we come from in terms of this work.” Hersey may not be a strong enough word for what the church is doing – but as the Bible tells us – God will not be mocked.

    "text": "Infosys Fires Over 40 Trainees for Failing Internal Assessments Karnataka DC Correspondent 27 March 2025 11:09 AM IST The termination follows a string of layoffs at the Mysuru campus, with affected trainees unable to meet the company's performance criteria despite additional training support x Infosys dismisses 30-45 trainees from its Mysuru branch after they failed to meet internal assessment standards despite additional preparation and mock tests. Software giant Infosys terminated at least 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru branch on Wednesday after they reportedly failed to meet the company’s internal assessment standards. The affected trainees, who were part of the Foundation Skills Training Program, were given several opportunities for additional preparation, including mock assessments and doubt-clearing sessions. However, despite these efforts, they did not meet the passing criteria, leading to their dismissal.\nSources revealed that this round of terminations comes just months after the company had already laid off around 350 trainees from the same campus. These previous trainees had experienced significant onboarding delays, waiting for over 2.5 years before being hired. The latest wave of layoffs has raised concerns regarding the company's training and assessment practices, especially within its entry-level programs.\nInfosys, known for its rigorous training programs, typically invests significant resources into the onboarding and skill development of its new employees. However, the company’s internal assessments have become increasingly stringent, and these recent terminations highlight the growing pressure to meet performance expectations.\nThe company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the latest round of layoffs. However, industry analysts suggest that these actions may reflect broader challenges in the tech industry, where companies are recalibrating their workforce strategies in response to market conditions and evolving skill demands.\nThe terminated trainees, who were primarily fresh graduates, now face an uncertain future in a competitive job market. While Infosys has not commented on the specifics of the terminations, sources close to the matter indicate that the company continues to focus on refining its training and assessment processes to maintain high standards.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Attackers use platforms such as YouTube and social media to share download links for fake installers to capitalize on user trust and drive clicks to malicious sites.\n- Threat actors often use reputable file hosting services like Mediafire and Mega.nz to conceal the origin of their malware and make detection and removal more difficult.\n- Many malicious downloads are password-protected and encoded, which complicates analysis in security environments such as sandboxes and allows malware to evade early detection.\n- Once infected, malware collects sensitive data from web browsers to steal credentials. This situation shows the serious risks of exposing your personal information by unknowingly downloading fraudulent software.\nIntroduction\nThe increase of fake installers bundled with info stealers is a growing threat for users looking for pirated software. These malicious programs disguise themselves as legitimate applications, often appearing in search results or [comments on platforms like GitHub](https://www.gendigital.com/blog/news/innovation/lumma-stealer-github). Unfortunately, many users fall prey to these tricks. The [Trend Micro™ Managed XDR](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/business/services/managed-xdr.html) service frequently sees the fallout, with the Lumma stealer being a prominent example. This highlights the hidden dangers of piracy that can jeopardize personal security and data integrity.\nInfo stealers are a type of malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from an infected system. This can include credentials, financial information, personal data, and other sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes.\nHow they lure their victims\nInfo stealers operate deceptively, luring victims into downloading the malware disguised as legitimate software installers. These download links often originate from fake websites or are shared as a link in messages from social platforms, as discussed in our [previous blog](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/research/23/j/beware-lumma-stealer-distributed-via-discord-cdn-.html).\nIn this blog, we want to highlight and break down how a typical user may stumble upon these download links of fake installers.\nVictims are lured into piracy by individuals posing as guides on popular video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These deceitful actors create a pretense of offering legitimate software installation tutorials to entice viewers to click on malicious links in the video descriptions or comments. This compromises users' devices and promotes a culture of theft. Here is an example.\nUpon accessing the link, a separate post on YouTube opens, revealing the download link for the fake installer.\nIn the following example, it leads to a download of the file from the Mediafire file hosting site:\nIn another case, the threat was uploaded to another file-hosting site called Mega.nz.\nIt's clear that the threat utilizes known file hosting services as another layer to obscure its download further and evade detection.\nIn the cases we will discuss in this blog, we observed that these threats are often distributed as fake installers or cracked software, which victims inadvertently encounter while searching for them on search engines.\nIn the sample below, specific keywords trigger search results for these entries.\nThe third item in the search results (refer to screenshot above) comes from OpenSea (an NFT marketplace), which is unusual because it hosted a downloadable file. The entry contains a shortened link that redirects to the actual link. One assumption is that they use shortened links to prevent scraping sites from accessing the download link.\nThe following link will prompt you for the actual download link and the zip file's password. Password-protecting the files can help prevent sandbox analysis of the initial file upon arrival, which can be a quick win for an adversary.\nThe fourth and last entry in the search results (refer to the search results screenshot above) came from SoundCloud, a music-sharing platform that hosted the download link with a corresponding description. In this case, the download link was shortened using Twitter.\nThe same user also posted additional entries that include means to download a specific file.\nContent from another entry made by the same user.\nSimilar to the first case, another site displays the download link and password.\nIn one of our download links, we discovered evidence of other entries they are attempting to fake, as shown in VirusTotal (VT).\nInfection analysis as seen by Managed XDR (post download)\nIn the next section, we will discuss instances where the download was successful and the content was executed. This case sample highlights the activities observed on the host.\nCase 1\nOne observation about the unpacked file is that its size is 900 MB. This large file size helps defense evasion and allows it to bypass sandbox analysis to appear more legitimate as an installer. Moreover, it is restricted from submission in VT.\nThe infection sequence is triggered upon executing the .exe file contained within the zip file.\nA threat has been detected involving the execution of batch files. The content of the batch file was sourced and, while different from the Managed XDR case, is still functionally similar.\nThe batch file contains obfuscated entries.\nThe first cleanup involves removing garbage entries.\nThe next step is to replace the variables, resulting in a clearer script.\nAccording to the batch file, it builds the AutoIt script by combining the multiple created files and executes it. Upon execution, we observed that it dropped several additional files.\nProcesses may be injected with its code, and a new legitimate binary is sometimes introduced for process injection.\nCollecting and preparing sensitive data from browser environments for credential access was completed through a copy file operation.\nThe process introduced by threat is also seen to establish connections to multiple command and control (C&C) addresses.\nBesides accessing its C&C, our investigation observed the threat committing a series of queries related to Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains.\nCase 2\nIn this second case, the infection started when a user downloaded a compressed file from a known file hosting site. Once downloaded, the user unpacks the file, which would require a password, and executes the installer. Upon execution, it proceeds to do a series of suspicious events, such as spawning a legitimate process and injecting its code into it. The threat also introduces a known scripting tool, AutoIt, to further obfuscate its execution, and later, it connects to its C&C to download and execute additional malware, typically different variants of infostealer.\nA snippet of the content of the zip file shows that, at a quick glance, it is just a standard application installer.\nSetup.exe is a version of rustdesk.exe, an open-source remote desktop access software identified on VirusTotal.\nThe zip file contains a trojanized file for rustdesk.exe, where one of the DLLs is tampered with. For this specific sample, the tampered DLL that was loaded by Setup.exe was flutter_gpu_texture_renderer_plugin.dll.\nWhen the file is executed, it displays an error but is already running in the background.\nIn the background, the following events have already taken place.\nInjecting malicious code into legitimate binaries, such as more.com, StrCmp.exe, SearchIndexer.exe, and explorer.exe, to evade detection by security defenses.\nIt drops additional files that are information stealers or malware from a different family.\nCreates autorun registry entry and scheduled tasks to ensure ongoing persistence.\nInjected processes were later observed, which initiated C&C communication.\nBundle of Stealers/Loaders\nThis time, it's not just a single info stealer but an army of recent noisy ones. This is not new, as it was also observed before with [raccoon stealers](https://threatpost.com/raccoon-stealer-google-seo/168301/).\nObserved stealers in the cases:\n- LUMMASTEALER\n- PRIVATELOADER\n- MARSSTEALER\n- AMADEY\n- PENGUISH\n- VIDAR\nRecap of the different methods of defense evasion observed in the case:\n- Utilization of large file size – a means to bypass sandbox capabilities\n- A password-protected zip file hinders content scanning and can complicate investigations if the password is unavailable.\n- The files are uploaded to known media-sharing sites, which most antivirus programs would only detect if the exact link is discovered before the download.\n- In some cases, download links are shortened, preventing scraping from sites.\n- The operation uses legitimate files and employs DLL sideloading or process injection to execute its payload.\nHow Managed XDR helps in the case of an info-stealer infection from fake installers\nDefense-in-depth is an important strategy that organizations use to protect their environments. In situations where a threat might have evaded some of these defense layers, Managed XDR can detect these incidents in real time. It offers the necessary analysis and actions to effectively contain the threat.\n- Threat hunting and human analyst augmented alerting - Some activities may not be captured by alerts or could generate low-severity alerts, which Trend Vision One users might overlook. Threat hunting proactively searches for known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) or emerging threats, ensuring that alerts are issued. Additionally, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) analysts can determine whether certain detections require further attention from the customer, reducing the burden on Trend Vision One users to check every alert.\n- Understanding the context of the alert – When a threat activity generates a detection, further correlation is necessary to provide context and capture the complete narrative of the events. Upon linking our findings to the initial alert, it becomes evident that most of the findings in the draft are not included in a single alert or detection. Additionally, some instances lack any related detection and were only connected through further investigation using the search application. As illustrated in the case findings shared earlier, these insights are obtained through the MXDR analyst's deeper investigation of the initial triggers, which may include threat hunting or alerts generated from a workbench.\n- Implementing response actions – As the fake installer infection progresses, MXDR analysts can initiate response actions to contain the threat on behalf of the customer. In the case we are dealing with, we have isolated the affected machines to prevent further spread. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) have been added to the Suspicions Objects (SO) list to block any additional execution, and the suspicious files have been submitted to the analysis team for accurate detection.\nConclusion\nThreat actors continue to use social engineering tactics to target its victims and apply different methods to avoid security defenses, including: DLL sideloading, using large installer files, password-protected ZIP files, process injection into legitimate processes, connections to legitimate websites, and creating copies of files and renaming them to appear benign.\nIt is important to stay updated on current threats and to remain vigilant regarding detection and alert systems. Visibility is important because solely relying on detection can result in many malicious activities going unnoticed. Organizations should consider the following to stay ahead of these threats:\n- Implement a multi-layered defense approach for in-depth defense.\n- Provide user education.\n- Establish an incident response plan.\n- Engage in threat hunting.\n- Use a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).\nOrganizations can take advantage of [Trend Vision One™ – Endpoint Security](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/business/products/endpoint-security.html) for prevention, detection, and response for user endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and data centers.\nManaged XDR offers a 24/7 managed detection and response (MDR) for email, endpoint, server, cloud workloads, and networks from our world-class MDR team\nTrend Vision One Threat Intelligence\nTo stay ahead of evolving threats, Trend Micro customers can also access a range of Intelligence Reports and Threat Insights within [Trend Vision One](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/business/products/one-platform.html). Threat Insights helps customers stay ahead of cyber threats before they happen and be better prepared for emerging threats.

    "title": "After losing Ather's Rs 2,000-cr investment to Maharashtra, Karnataka BJP, Congress leaders blame each other",
    "text": "After losing Ather&#039;s Rs 2,000-cr investment to Maharashtra, Karnataka BJP, Congress leaders blame each other A war of words erupted between Congress and BJP leaders in Karnataka after Bengaluru-based electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy decided to establish its new and third manufacturing facility in Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC) in Maharashtra with an investment of Rs 2,000 crore. Deputy leader of the opposition and BJP&#039;s Arvind Bellad was among the first to criticise the Congress-led state government. &quot;Karnataka loses Ather Energy Plant to Maharashtra! ₹2000 crore investment and 4000 job creation opportunity missed! It&#039;s deeply concerning that Karnataka, home to Ather Energy, lost a major ₹2000 crore investment and 4000 jobs to Maharashtra,” he wrote on microblogging site X. &quot;The Congress government&#039;s lack of effort and initiative is glaring. CM Siddaramaiah failed to even engage in discussions with this Bengaluru-based company. This inaction has cost us dearly,&quot; further added Bellad. Industries Minister MB Patil blames previous BJP-led govt State Large and Medium Industries Minister MB Patil blamed the previous BJP government for Ather EV&#039;s decision to relocate its operations to Maharashtra from Karnataka. &quot;The previous BJP government sanctioned only 35 acres to Ather, despite the company&#039;s request for 50 acres, with 5 acres of the allocated land embroiled in controversy. Frustrated by these issues, Ather returned to the land and ultimately decided to shift to Maharashtra,&quot; Patil said. He further claimed that the Congress government introduced an EV policy in 2017, but the subsequent BJP administration failed to capitalise on it. Patil pointed out that BJP leaders, now criticising the Congress over Ather, remained silent when Ola chose Tamil Nadu over Karnataka. &quot;Despite these challenges, the recent Congress government promised to sanction 50 acres for Ather near Haraluru-Muddenahalli under the single-window scheme. However, by then, Ather had already decided to move to Maharashtra&quot;, Patil said. BJP President BY Vijayendra wrote on X, &quot;What a Shame that @INCKarnataka govt lost a Rs 2000cr Investment opportunity to the neighboring Maharashtra state due to its sheer callousness &amp; lack of vision towards Development of the State!&quot; &quot;How concerning to note that @atherenergy chose to Invest in Maharashtra despite having its Headquarters in Karnataka. This reflects the pathetic state of affairs under the Congress govt which has all but destroyed the status of Karnataka as first choice destination for Investments. Hope the @INCKarnataka govt wakes up from slumber &amp; work towards re-establishing Karnataka as the most preferred State for New Investments!&quot; Vijayendra&#039;s post reads. Responding to BJP leader and former Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan, spokesperson for the Congress government in Karnataka and IT-BT Minister and Priyank Kharge wrote on X: “Always happy to debate on investments got or lost. A reminder of what we lost when you were at the helm: -Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor ₹ 1,540 Bn – Gujarat, Ola EV manufacturing ₹ 2400 Cr, Tata phone component manufacturing ₹ 5000 Cr, Pegatron iPhone manufacturing ₹ 8000 Cr”.",

    "text": "A large slice of the capital will be facing severe winds this weekend (Saturday December 30 and Sunday December 31) according to new weather warnings from the Met Office.\nThe meteorologists have issued maps showing whereabouts in the country people should be wary of the foul weather. On both days, most of South and part of North East London are set to be hounded by seriously strong gusts.\nThankfully, London avoids the worst of the rain and snow, which is limited to coastal areas, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nREAD MORE: January London weather map shows bleakest possible start to 2024\nSaturday will see the winds arrive in force across much of London The yellow wind warning stretches across Kent, up the coast into East Anglia, and west across much of Wales and England&apos;s southern coast.\nThe Met Office also warns that the winds may be more than an inconvenience, as disruption to travel is possible. The forecast predicts that bus and train services could be affected, while &apos;short term loss of power&apos; isn&apos;t unthinkable.\nNew Year&apos;s Eve won&apos;t be much better If you&apos;re travelling back from coastal areas after Christmas, spray and large waves are likely as well as the wind.\nThankfully, there are no weather warnings over London for New Year&apos;s Day, just a lot of rain.\nIn fact, BBC Weather forecasts a straight week of rain, with every day between January 1 and January 8 being wet and grey. Maps from WXCharts show that London will be getting the bleakest start possible to 2024 with rain clouds overhead for two days.\nGet the biggest stories from around London straight to your inbox.
