    "text": "Breathtaking Northern Lights over Plymouth as city spectacularly lit up There may be a chance to see them again tonight\nBookmark\nShare\nComments News By Katie Timms Senior Content Editor 09:09, 11 OCT 2024 Bookmark\nWilliam Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10] (Image: William Green) Plymouth's sky was spectacularly lit up by the Northern Lights last night - and many people were awake to witness the incredible display.\nPeople across the UK, including in Devon and Cornwall, were treated to the fabulous display of pink, red and green lights throughout yesterday evening and early morning, as the aurora borealis made its grand appearance.\nSome lucky people who were able to pick up the lights on their phones, shared their incredible snaps with us, which you can see below.\nIf you were fast asleep, there's a possibility you may be able to see the lights again tonight, October 11. Although the Met Office previously stated that last night, October 10, was the best time to see the aurora, they also mentioned that there was a possibility of them appearing between 10pm and 11pm tonight.\nHowever, the chances of witnessing the Northern Lights again tonight are much lower. The Met Office's latest space weather forecast indicates that the likelihood of seeing the aurora will gradually decrease through October 11 and become limited to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.\nProfessor Jim Wild, a 49-year-old academic from Lancaster University who studies the aurora and space weather, was able to capture the Northern Lights from his back garden last night. He shared the special experience with his family, saying: \"My research focuses on the physics of the connections between the sun and the Earth.\n\"I've had the opportunity to visit the Arctic Circle multiple times to take measurements of the aurora, but seeing the Northern Lights from my own back garden with my entire family is truly special.\"\nIf you would like to share your photographs, please email news@plymouthherald.co.uk.\nWilliam Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 1 of 8 Share\nComments William Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 2 of 8 Share\nComments The Northern Lights over Plymouth\n(Image: Submitted) 3 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 4 of 8 Share\nComments William Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 5 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 6 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 7 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 8 of 8 Share\nComments More On Weather",

    "text": "An all-day breakfast and brunch restaurant has opened in College Park, complete with cocktails and a biscuit flight.\nLeAnna Lynn opened Buttermilk Biscuit at the end of November at 1634 Virginia Ave. The restaurateur previously owned Cru Lounge in Midtown, but said the late hours made it difficult to spend time with her children. Buttermilk Biscuit, with its opening hour of 8 a.m., is a far cry from the late nights, but it suits her breakfast-loving personality, she said.\nShe wanted Buttermilk to be a place where families could eat together and “remind you of home and grandma’s fresh baked biscuits,” she said. The restaurant is bright, with indoor and heated outdoor seating in a “modern farmhouse” style.\nExplore Metro Atlanta restaurant openings\nCredit: Courtesy of Buttermilk Biscuit\nCredit: Courtesy of Buttermilk Biscuit\nThe eatery offers cocktails like a Hennessy espresso martini, mimosas and Lynn’s spin on a bloody mary. As for the food, she knew from the beginning that she wanted to include biscuits made daily, using a recipe that’s “a collaboration between our talented in-house chefs and a biscuit expert,” she said.\nThe biscuit trio comes with three biscuits: classic buttermilk, garlic cheddar and blueberry lemon zest. They’re accompanied by jams and butters made in-house with flavors like blueberry, peach and strawberry. Other menu highlights include the Morning Dish, with eggs, potatoes and meat; the buttermilk chicken biscuit; chicken and waffles; and a pancake stack.\nExplore Intown Atlanta dining news\nCredit: Courtesy of Buttermilk Biscuit\nCredit: Courtesy of Buttermilk Biscuit\nLynn said she hopes to bring Buttermilk Biscuit to suburbs where there aren’t many locally-owned spots.\n“I really want to bring that sense of community to other communities,” she said.\nCollege Park, located near the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, is also home to breakfast-focused eateries The Breakfast Boys , Johnny’s Chicken and Waffles and The Real Milk & Honey , while Eat My Biscuits recently opened in neighboring East Point.\nButtermilk Biscuit is open daily 8 a.m.-4 p.m.\n1634 Virginia Ave., College Park. 404-941-7328, buttermilkbiscuitatl.com\nExplore These metro area restaurants offer shareable food flights Explore The ultimate guide to comfort food in metro Atlanta Sign up for the AJC Food and Dining Newsletter\nRead more stories like this by liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook , following @ATLDiningNews on Twitter and @ajcdining on Instagram .\nAbout the Author\nOlivia Wakim Olivia Wakim is a digital content producer on the food and dining team.

    "text": "Cards’ Nine-Game Winning Streak Snapped\nLamar University's women's basketball team suffered a 60-48 setback against Southeastern Louisiana, ending their nine-game winning streak. Trailing by three at halftime, the Cardinals struggled in the crucial third quarter, where they were outscored 21-10. NJ Weems led Lamar with 15 points, but defensive lapses allowed the Lady Lions to dominate, scoring 36 points in the paint. Lamar will look to bounce back in their upcoming game against Stephen F. Austin this Saturday.\n- Lamar shot 35.4% from the field and matched Southeastern with 35 rebounds.\n- Southeastern forced 19 turnovers, converting them into 24 points.\n- Lamar's loss puts them at 14-5 overall, with a 9-1 record in the Southland Conference.\n- Southeastern Louisiana improves to 17-3 and maintains an undefeated 11-0 record in the conference.\nThe Cardinals will face Stephen F. Austin on Saturday, crucial for regaining momentum after the loss. A win could help restore confidence and solidify their standings in the conference.\nBottom LineLamar must address their defensive shortcomings and improve ball control to bounce back from this loss. Continued winner-losing streaks may now depend on their ability to adapt quickly in upcoming matches.\nRead more at Lamar University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has not commented on these decisions. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Jerusalem | Updated: 28-06-2024 03:09 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 03:09 IST - Country: - Israel Israel's hard-line finance minister said on Thursday that the government would promote West Bank settlements and punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority in response to Palestinian moves against Israel on the international stage. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads a pro-settler party, said in a statement that the government supported his proposal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, which usually announces cabinet-level decisions, did not issue any statements and was not reachable for immediate comment. Among the steps Smotrich said he was advancing was the revoking of \"various approvals and benefits\" for senior officials in the Palestinian Authority, approving new settlement buildings, and retroactively sanctioning some Jewish settlements.

    "text": "Tromba marina en Tampico. (Meteoalert) Esta mañana se registró una tromba marina en la zona sur de Tamaulipas, informó el meteorólogo Alexander Dadderio mediante sus redes sociales. ¿Qué pasó? De acuerdo a su reporte, este fenómeno meteorológico se presentó la mañana de este jueves sobre el sistema lagunario, el sistema de captación de agua más importante de la zona sur del estado. &quot;Una tromba marina se presentó sobre el sistema lagunario hace unos minutos.&quot; Pero, ¿Qué es una tromba marina? De acuerdo a la Subsecretaría de Gestión del Riesgo y Protección Civil, la tromba marina es &quot;un fenómeno meteorológico que se produce sobre el agua, en un lugar muy puntual y que a diferencia de los tornados, van desde la superficie hacia la nube. Por lo general tienen entre uno y dos kilómetros de diámetro&quot;. ¿Por qué se presentó una tromba en Tampico? De acuerdo al director de MeteoAlert, es un fenómeno meteorológico normal en la zona conurbada en los meses de junio a septiembre. Pese a que pareciera algo sumamente peligroso y muy parecido a un tornado, suele ser peligroso para la navegación en la laguna o mar, pero no logran ingresar a la zona terrestre, asegura Dadderio. Además exhorta a las personas que logren visualizar uno de eso a tomar fotografía &quot;Si ves una y estás en tierra, no temas, aprovecha a tomarle foto, ya que, duran poco tiempo y al tocar tierra se disipan&quot;. ​SJHN",
