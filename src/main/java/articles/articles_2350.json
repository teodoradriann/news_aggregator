    "text": "Shiba Inu price moved into a bear market, falling by over 20% from its highest level this week as the recent crypto bull run faded.\nShiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, was trading at $0.000024 on Friday, Nov. 15, as most coins dropped. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remained below $90,000 as the recent bull run stalled.\nStill, there are signs that SHIB price will bounce back, and possibly retest its highest level this week at $0.00003045. For example, data from Shibburn shows that the Shiba Inu burn rate rose by 115% in the last 24 hours.\nOver 16.1 million coins were burned, meaning that 410 trillion have been burned since its inception, bringing the circulating supply to 583 trillion tokens. Token burns happen when cryptocurrencies are moved to an inaccessible address, reducing the number of those in circulation.\nAnother potential catalyst for Shiba Inu price is that the number of total addresses in Shibarium has jumped to over 1.89 million. If the trend continues rising, there is a likelihood that these addresses will rise to 2 million in the coming months.\nMeanwhile, the number of transactions completed in Shibarium has risen above 509 million in the past few months. This performance is notable since Shibarium is Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain network. Some of the BONE tokens collected in fees are moved into SHIB and burned.",

    "text": "Boeing Faces Worker Strike Amidst Growing Challenges Boeing's factory workers in the U.S. West Coast went on strike after rejecting a contract, bringing production of the 737 MAX and other jets to a halt. The strike poses multiple challenges for Boeing, including managing production delays and a strained relationship with employees and unions. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 12:34 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 12:34 IST Boeing's West Coast factory workers initiated a strike early Friday after 96% voted in favor, suspending production of the 737 MAX amid ongoing delays and debts. This strike, Boeing's first since 2008, follows CEO Kelly Ortberg's recent appointment and a mid-air incident involving a 737 MAX door panel. Approximately 30,000 workers from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) are striking after rejecting a 25% wage increase and other contract terms. Negotiations were led by union representative Jon Holden, who emphasized the need for respect and a better future for workers. Boeing aims to renegotiate terms quickly, as the strikes have posed significant operational challenges and financial risks, potentially impacting the company's recovery and relations with airlines and suppliers. A prolonged strike could severely affect Boeing's cash flow and market ratings. (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "title": "In A Possible Conflict With China, The Philippines Will Stand With The U.S. Despite The Consequences | MEMRI",
    "text": "It is common knowledge that the Communist Party of China (CCP) views Taiwan as a rogue state within China's greater sovereign domain. By constitutional mandate, China is committed to unifying Taiwan with the mainland by peaceful means or by force. With Taiwan asserting its independence, an invasion of the island state by China is likely at some point in the future. Some analysts speculate that it could take place in 2027 in conjunction with the centennial anniversary of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Others believe that a Chinese invasion will not occur within the next decade for three reasons. One, China's economy is in bad shape and Beijing is not in a financial position to finance a war. Two, China's military is not strong enough to face America's barrier of deterrence in the first island chain. Three, China plays the long game and is waiting for America to weaken. No one knows when China will make its move. But nations are preparing for the eventuality, as they should. For years, the United States has maintained strategic ambiguity as to whether it will defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion. This ambiguity was broken in September 2022 when President Joe Biden declared that the United States would indeed come to Taiwan's defense. [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/possible-conflict-china-philippines-will-stand-us-despite-consequences#_edn1) With this, a showdown between the world's two superpowers could very well ensue. US INDOPACOM commander Samuel Paparo and Philippines chief Gen. Romero Brawner Jr (Source: X) A War Over Taiwan Will Have Far-Reaching Implications For The Filipino People ASEAN is expected to maintain neutrality in this possible armed conflict since its member states have interests that they need to protect with both the U.S. and China. Yet, neutrality is not an option for the Philippines. The Philippines and the U.S. are bound by a Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) and the Philippines has granted the U.S. access to its airspace, maritime domain, and nine military bases. [[2]](https://www.memri.org/reports/possible-conflict-china-philippines-will-stand-us-despite-consequences#_edn2) Hence, the Philippines (along with Japan) would be the de facto launch site of the U.S. military action. Moreover, the Luzon Strait and the West Philippine Sea are expected to be theaters of conflict, thus dragging the Philippines into war. A war over Taiwan will have far-reaching implications for the Filipino people, its economy, and its future. Fear of being caught in the crossfire will spark a refugee crisis among Filipinos similar to the Vietnamese refugee crisis of 1975. Those unable to flee from perilous areas will face the loss of livelihood, property, and lives. The economic impact will be substantial. A war in Taiwan will interrupt the country's strong economic momentum and derail its path toward high-middle income status; China and Taiwan are the Philippine's third and eighth largest trading partners, respectively. Both are integral suppliers of raw materials and intermediate goods. The disruption of trade will affect Philippine manufactures and exports; The humanitarian cost of war will weigh heavy on the Philippines, and this can potentially relegate the country to a debt crisis. The damage to infrastructure and opportunity loss from tourism and investments will be substantive. The specter of China's successful takeover of Taiwan will pose risks to Philippine security. This is because Taiwan is the strategic and geographical buffer between China and the Philippines. With Taiwan subsumed, the Philippines would become the next target for China's expansionism. Moreover, Beijing's control over Taiwan would increase China's power projection in the region, and this would adversely affect the Philippines' claims over the West Philippine Sea. Worse, Chinese control of sea lanes would put free trade in the Indo-Pacific in serious peril. Effects On China And Global Players According to analysts, if the war in Taiwan were to break out today, China would be unsuccessful in its invasion while sustaining enormous damage to both its military and economy. China's export economy would collapse with the combination of trade sanctions, supply chain disruptions, logistic barricades, and general contraction of global trade. This would result in a spate of bankruptcies among Chinese enterprises. China would also lose access to global finance for which it sources $7.5 trillion a year. This would result in the collapse of the Chinese financial system. As for collateral damage, China would be left with tens of thousands of dead, wounded, or captured soldiers. Its navy and amphibious force would be obliterated and would take a decade to rebuild. Meanwhile, China would cement its image as a global pariah, a status the U.S. would leverage to isolate her even more. The U.S. would also sustain some financial and military damage but would recover faster than China. However, it will be among the hardest-hit economies when the global recession takes hold. Taiwan, as the decisive theater of conflict, would be broken in terms of human casualties, military assets, and infrastructure. The damage would set back the republic by 40 years. Taiwan would struggle to deliver basic services to its citizens immediately after the conflict and would rely on foreign aid. The effects on the global economy would supersede the Ukraine war. After all, China is ten times larger than Russia and Taiwan is four times larger than Ukraine. Global supply chains would be dislocated with Taiwan being the source of 92 percent of advanced computer chips and China a supplier of most intermediate and manufactured goods. All these will trigger a shortage of food, smart electronics, raw materials, and capital equipment. This will lead to worldwide hyperinflation coupled with a long protracted economic recession. It is expected to set the world economy back 20 years. The invasion of Taiwan could take place tomorrow or in 2035. No one knows. Yet, one thing is for sure, we must all prepare for it with a sense urgency. Meanwhile, tensions in the region fester. *Andrew J. Masigan is the MEMRI China Media Studies Project Special Advisor.

    "title": "El \"engaño\" de la recolocación de los empleados de Bimbo: \"Nos piden pasar de hacer donuts a conducir camiones\"",
    "text": "Noticias relacionadas Estos son los puestos de trabajo que Martínez Marcos ofrece a los empleados de Bimbo en Valladolid Desesperación, desolación y hasta lágrimas. Los trabajadores de Bimbo vuelven a verse en la calle tras la promesa de un plan de reindustrialización que no se asemeja en nada a lo que habían anunciado.\nEl plan lo hay, la empresa también -se llama Martínez Marcos-, pero ¿qué hay de la letra pequeña? Esas líneas del contrato que casi nadie lee y tienden a ser las más importantes. Más en estas situaciones donde pasas de tenerlo todo a nada en cuestión de minutos.\nLa empresa familiar vallisoletana aparecía como una especie de salvavidas hace unas semanas tras la caída del imperio de los donuts. 160 personas se quedaban en la calle, con sus familias y proyectos de vida bajo el brazo , y una pequeña luz asomaba, aunque muy sigilosa, para dar un poco de aliento.\nRubén Cacho Ical\nEl futuro de los trabajadores de Bimbo: 43 prejubilados, 4 a Córdoba, 38 a Medina y 68 se quedan con Martínez Marcos La ilusión ha durado poco. Demasiado poco. Este jueves, 28 de noviembre, los dueños de Martínez Marcos, que ocupará estas instalaciones -ubicadas en el Polígono San Cristóbal-, se reunían con el Comité de Empresa para informar sobre los puestos que estarán disponibles una vez que Bimbo cierre sus puertas.\nLo que parecía ser un salvavidas ha terminado por ahogarles aún más. 30 conductores de camión, 14 puestos para el taller -desde mantenimiento a chapa y pintura o limpieza de cisternas- y seis de administrativo.\n\"Nos han vendido una reindustrialización que no es\", asegura Eva Fernández, una de las empleadas, en declaraciones a EL ESPAÑOL- Noticias de Castilla y León. El enfado, la ira y la desesperación se han apoderado de ellos al tener que volver a preguntarse: ¿Y ahora qué?\nLos puestos que les ofrecen necesitan \"cualificación o una Formación Profesional en automoción\" . Algo que, por ahora, no tienen. \"La publicidad que hace Bimbo para ellos no es así. Quieren que pasemos de hacer donuts a conducir camiones\", asegura.\nY es que, para los puestos de conductor de camión, necesitas el carné, lo que llevaría \"9 meses para sacarlo y dinero perdido\". Además, explica: \"No nos vamos a Medina por no estar en la carretera y jugarnos la vida, como para ser camionero con 50 años. No lo vemos\".\nLo que está claro es que esto no era lo que prometieron, o al menos lo que los trabajadores habían entendido. Porque ninguno está conforme con lo que se les ofrece y el malestar es general.\nLo único que ven factible son los trabajos de administración, que tan solo son seis, y \"estarán ocupados por quienes han venido desempeñando estas funciones\". Por lo demás, dudas, incertidumbre y, nuevamente, \" en lucha por vernos sin nada\".\nFernández comprende las necesidades de la nueva empresa, pero lamenta que son oficios \"muy específicos\" para los que no están cualificados y que, en ningún caso, están satisfechos.\n\"Me dicen que si me saco el carné de camión me cogen. Claro, aquí y en cualquier lado. Lo que ofrecen no es una ganga. El sentir es malo. Había gente llorando porque esto no fue lo que se nos había comentado\", asegura.\nUn jarro de agua fría para la gran mayoría de los trabajadores que se ve nuevamente en la calle y sin poder optar a unos puestos para los que se necesita un conocimiento del sector.\nMiriam Chachón y Cedidas Ical\nLa caída del imperio de los donuts en Valladolid y cientos de dramas: \"Toca empezar de cero con hipotecas y niños\" Medina del Campo, un destino temporal La planta de Bimbo de Medina del Campo era una de las opciones que parecía más viable para los trabajadores. Pero las condiciones no son demasiado atractivas como para hacer más de 100 kilómetros cada día.\nLes ofrecen 3.600 euros durante tres meses , lo que equivale a una media de 1.200 al mes. Para la gasolina, la ayuda mensual que les dan es de 291 euros , una cifra que \"no cubre el gasto total porque es mucho más\".\nEn el caso de Eva, por ejemplo, tiene un coche con 23 años: \"No estoy en situación de ir. Luego tienes que hacer revisiones, cambiar ruedas. Es un gasto a mayores\".\nAlgunos han elegido esta opción, durante seis meses, par poder acceder a la posterior indemnización. En total, son 38 quienes han apostado por esta solución , pero no ha sido del agrado de nadie.\nPrejubilaciones o buscar trabajo Una historia que, para algunos, ha tenido un final más dulce. Los mayores de 55 años, que llevaban muchos años en la empresa, han podido acceder a la prejubilación. Una suerte que no han tenido quienes llevaban poco tiempo.\nPara el resto, los que se quedan en el limbo, será la empresa LHH quien se encargue de ayudarles a actualizar sus currículums o mandarles alguna oferta que pueda cuadrar con sus perfiles.\nSegún informan desde el Comité de Empresa de CCOO, hay seis personas que han solicitado el traslado fuera de la Comunidad : cuatro a Puente Genil (Córdoba), una al PAI de Guadalajara y otra a Solares (Cantabria).\nUna empresa familiar Martínez Marcos es una empresa familiar de Valladolid que fue fundada por Eladio Martínez Marcos en 1963 . Cuenta con sede en Valladolid, en la carretera Burgos- Portugal y tiene implantación a nivel nacional en Madrid, Tarragona, Bilbao, Sevilla, Valencia y Málaga.\nUna empresa que se dedica al transporte a granel en España y, para ello, cuenta con una flota de más de 200 camiones, especializados en el tratamiento de distintos productos.\nAdemás, cuentan con cinco estaciones de lavado de cisternas. Ofrecen también un servicio de lavado y vaporizado del interior de cisternas y también lavado del exterior de camiones.\nUn cambio de paradigma que los trabajadores no se esperaban y que tendrán que esperar para ver qué sucede con su futuro.\nValladolid (Municipio) Grupo Bimbo Economía Castilla y León",

    "text": "New long-term clinical data from Eli Lilly and Company show that Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) provided sustained benefit in early Alzheimer’s over a three-year period.\nIn the extension study of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, the antibody drug slowed cognitive decline in individuals with the condition.\nKey preliminary data from the long-term extension study of Eli Lilly’s Kisunla\nParticipants who were given Kisunla earlier, attained a 27 percent reduction in their risk of progression to the next stage of disease. This was compared to individuals treated later. However, this data, shared at the 2025 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC), found that participants still benefited when they began treatment later on.\nMoreover, the drug's benefit continued to grow over three years, compared to participants in the matched untreated external cohort from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) group.\nAdditionally, the three-year data showed:\nOver 75 percent of study participants attained amyloid clearance within 76 weeks of starting Kisunla In participants who completed treatment with Kisunla, amyloid plaque reaccumulation remained slow, according to observed data after up to 2.5 years. “The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 long-term extension reaffirms that Kisunla delivered sustained clinical benefit that continued to increase over three years and a consistent safety profile”\n“The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 long-term extension reaffirms that Kisunla delivered sustained clinical benefit that continued to increase over three years and a consistent safety profile,” stated Dr Mark Mintun, Group Vice President, Neuroscience Research & Development , Eli Lilly and Company . “Participants continued to show meaningful outcomes, reinforcing the long-term value of early intervention.”\n\"With over 30 Alzheimer's drugs now in late-stage trials globally, momentum is building - and more will enter regulatory systems in the years ahead… Government must work with NICE, the NHS and industry to pilot licensed drugs, gather more data, and prepare the health system for what's ahead,\" Hilary Evans-Newton\n, Chief Executive at Alzheimer's Research UK , shared following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)'s recommendation last month against approval of Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab) for mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer's.
