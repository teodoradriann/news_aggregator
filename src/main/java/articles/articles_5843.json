    "title": "From UCF to the Big Screen: Alum’s Award-winning Film Sparks Social Change",
    "text": "The streets of a small neighborhood nestled in the heart of Greater Miami echo with the sounds of Haitian Kreyòl. Vibrant buildings adorned in pastel blues, pinks and greens, alongside lively street art and bustling markets unmistakably mark the area is Little Haiti. Monica Sorelle ’12 lived nearby, as her mother had settled in Little Haiti and later North Miami after immigrating from Haiti to the U.S. in the ’80s. Sorelle’s childhood largely unfolded within Little Haiti, a neighborhood home to tens of thousands of Haitian immigrants. The area was named by activist Viter Juste, who relocated from Brooklyn to Miami in 1973 and persuaded other Haitians to settle there. It has existed for decades as a cultural and artistic mecca for the Haitian community in Florida, and where Sorelle is constantly immersed in her culture. Yet Little Haiti has been the recent target of climate gentrification. The area’s proximity to Miami’s beaches and downtown make it attractive. And as sea levels rise and weather events heighten in South Florida due to climate change, Little Haiti has become the premier in-land target for developers and real estate agents. Unable to stand by and watch Little Haiti rapidly dissolve, Sorelle — a UCF film graduate and Haitian American filmmaker — sought to tell its story through film. “I wanted to produce something that sounded the bell that gentrification was happening in the area,” she says. Her film Mountains follows Xavier, a Haitian demolition worker, and his wife and son. As the family outgrows their home in Little Haiti, Xavier aims to fulfill the American Dream by buying a new house. However, his work sites encroach dangerously close to his neighborhood, putting his loyalty to the test. Since its premiere in 2023, Mountains has garnered widespread acclaim, earning recognition and awards at major film festivals such as Tribeca and Indie Memphis. Sorelle was even recognized at the 2024 Film Independent Spirit Awards as the recipient of the Someone to Watch Award, which honors first-time narrative filmmakers of singular vision along with a $25,000 grant. Here, Sorelle shares the inspiration for her debut feature film, emphasizes the importance of uplifting her community, highlights her unwavering belief in her dreams and more. When did you initially discover your passion for film, and how did you develop it? At age 5, I knew I wanted to become an actress. By age 10, I began practicing my acting skills by writing my own scripts with my friends at school and acting them out for fun after school. I’d even print out scripts from shows like SNL and act them out. My interest in filmmaking didn’t spark until I was 15. My first introduction to filmmaking happened a year later when I took my first film class with the Florida Film Institute. In Haitian culture, it’s common for professions like lawyer, doctor and engineer to be highly respected and admired. When I initially told my family that I wanted to work in the film industry, they suggested I become an entertainment lawyer instead. But growing up in a Haitian household gave me a sense of audacity in terms of the things that I’m able to achieve. Even though my family was working class, just the very notion of them picking up and moving to America to start over and create a life for themselves is admirable. I knew that anything was possible for me. Can you tell us about your college experience? What drew you to further your film studies at UCF? Following high school graduation, I earned my associate in arts degree from Miami Dade College, where I took my first screenwriting and film history classes. I transferred to UCF because of its micro-budget filmmaking track, which many other film schools didn’t have during that time. I wanted an authentic college experience — one where I wasn’t just in an arts program, but also exposed to tons of different people. During my time as a Knight, I was a member of the Foreign Film Club, which introduced me to many art house and foreign films. I also worked on plenty of sets in the film department. In 2012, I graduated with my bachelor’s in film from UCF and moved back to my hometown of Miami, where I got involved in making short films and worked on casting for the Oscar-winning film Moonlight. What was the “Aha” moment that inspired the idea for your film Mountains? Once I began to see the rise of gentrification in Little Haiti, I sought to make a difference by getting involved with nonprofits in the area. I pursued community organizing, and quickly realized that it wasn’t a strength of mine. The only thing that was always on my mind and excited me since I was a kid is film. I thought, “Maybe this is what I can use to tell the story of Little Haiti.” Between 2014 and 2018, I brainstormed different ideas, but none materialized. It wasn’t until 2018 when me and my coworker/fellow filmmaker, Robert Colom, passed by a couple of demolition workers while walking to lunch in Wynwood (another Miami neighborhood known for being an entertainment district) that an idea sparked. The workers had just finished their day and were packing up to go home. One worker stood out as he said goodbye to his coworkers and crossed a major street that separated the arts district from the still suburban, Puerto Rican-influenced side of Wynwood. I wondered if he lived over there and just crossed the street for work — making him directly and indirectly a part of his own gentrification. Then I turned to Robert and jokingly said, “Micro budget idea: A demolition worker lives so close to home that he can walk to his worksite.” We learned of the local nonprofit Oolite Arts’ Cinematic Arts Residency program that awards $50,000 to people to make their first feature film. With no hesitation, Robert and I pulled an all-nighter to apply to the program with our demolition worker idea. Our application was the last to be submitted and one of two of the first projects through the program. As a Haitian American filmmaker, how do you navigate representing your culture authentically in your work? Unfortunately, we’re not used to seeing ourselves portrayed in this way in the media and film. It’s usually sensationalized and dehumanizing stories or American actors with bad accents playing roles of Haitian people. I don’t ever feel like we’ve had the means to completely portray ourselves. So, I wanted to make sure I created a film that I and other Haitian Americans perceive as closer to our actual lives. Mountains is co-written by me, a Haitian American, has a cast largely made up of Haitian people, and about 80% of the dialogue is in Haitian Kreyòl. Mountains addresses the theme of displacement due to gentrification. How do you hope your film contributes to discussions on this issue? For a while, I was so upset with how powerless the immigrant communities in Miami were to mass development happening across the city. I saw how Wynwood rapidly transformed into a modern arts district from a vibrant Puerto Rican neighborhood. And I began to see this same pattern happening in Little Haiti. Gentrification is in progress, and I don’t know if Mountains can stop this machine. It’s powerful and resourced, unlike a lot of immigrant communities. But at least naming what’s going on and seeing yourself and your neighborhood reflected is empowering. Now that Mountains exists, it’s going to exist forever. No one will be able to deny that Little Haiti was and is here. No matter what ends up happening in the future, we’ll have this film to remember. There’s no evil developer in the film because I don’t think it’s about a singular person — it’s about a system. I think that people in these systems of power should see the film. Even if they don’t like what they see, I’m excited to get their wheels turning in their minds, change some perspectives and just use this film to be as disruptive as possible. From watching the Film Independent Spirit Awards as a teenager to being recognized with the Someone to Watch Award during the 2024 ceremony. What are your plans for the future following this full circle moment? The Film Independent Spirit Awards are like my Oscars. I’ve always had an interest in independent filmmaking and was always intrigued by the films that I was exposed to through the awards. To now be an honoree is something that I’ve always dreamed of. When making Mountains, I wasn’t even sure anyone would see it. From premiering at the 2023 Tribeca Festival in New York City to making its international debut at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada in September and being this low budget underdog in the independent film sphere that still got nominated is still shocking to me. We’re continuing our film festival run and working on getting Mountains in theaters. My focus is to continue making films as a writer, director and producer that are specific to South Florida, immigrant or first-generation kids, and the forces that are influencing how we live and how we rebel against them. Catch the screening of Mountains at the Enzian Theatre Saturday, April 20, as part of the 2024 Florida Film Festival. The film is set to premiere at 12:45 p.m.",

    "title": "Meta's Copyright Lawsuit in the US Highlights Complex Liability in AI Training Using Open Source Data",
    "text": "A group of authors in the US— Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman and Christopher Golden claim that Meta torrented and processed their books to train its artificial intelligence models. The authors had originally filed a case against Meta’s copyright infringement of their works back in 2023. In their original lawsuit, the authors mentioned that the company used their books as a part of the training dataset “without consent, without credit and without compensation”.\nAs per a recent discovery order in the case, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave the company’s AI team orders to use the LibGen dataset. The fact discovery in the case also reveals that Meta engineers filtered out lines of copyright management information (CMI) to train its AI model Llama. This is despite the fact that in response to piracy discussions during the case, Zuckerberg said that such activity “raises lots of red flags.”\nWhat is Lib-Gen? Library Genesis or Lib-Gen is a file-sharing project that provides access to copyrighted works like academic books and journal articles. Besides the current lawsuit, publishers have in the past also filed court cases against LibGen for facilitating online piracy.\nFor instance, in India , Elsevier, The American Chemical, and Wiley Publications filed a court case against LibGen and fellow free academic paper-accessing site SciHub in India in 2020 for copyright infringement. The publishers urged the country to permanently block the sites in India. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) across multiple countries including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany block access to LibGen links.\nDetails of the authors’ lawsuit: In their 2023 lawsuit , the authors mentioned that in a table describing the contents of its AI models’ training dataset, Meta had listed that 85 gigabytes (GB) came from books. These books come from two sources:\nProject Gutenberg: an online archive of approximately 70,000 books that are out of copyright The Book3 section of The Pile, a publicly available training data for large language models. The authors say that the data from the Pile’s Book3 data set includes a mix of fiction and non-fiction books from the “shadow library” Bibliotik similar to other free book sites like Zlib, LibGen, and SciHub. “These shadow libraries have long been of interest to the AI-training community because of the large quantity of copyrighted material they host,” the lawsuit suggests.\nWhy it matters: While it seems here that Zuckerberg knew about the presence of LibGen sources in the company’s database, this lawsuit brings up some key questions about liability in the AI ecosystem. Meta acquired this data through an open-source dataset, which was accumulated from Bibliotik Private Tracker, part of the many shadow libraries like LibGen. If an AI company obtained the data through open-source datasets, which in turn obtained it from shadow libraries, who bears liability at each step of this chain? While some have filed cases against piracy websites in the past, should open-source dataset creators also bear liability for infringement?\nCopyright concerns with AI model training: Meta isn’t the only company to face a lawsuit for allegedly using copyrighted information to train its models. In the recent past, others like Microsoft and OpenAI have also been hit with a series of lawsuits from authors and news publications suggesting that the two used their information to train AI models. In what appears to be a response to these cases, OpenAI signed an agreement with the News Corp which gave it access to the content of major news publications like The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and The Daily Telegraph in May last year. Microsoft similarly signed an agreement with Harper Collins to train AI on its books in November last year . Just like OpenAI and Microsoft, Meta also signed a content licensing deal with Reuters in October last year.\nAlso read:",

José Tolentino de Mendonça destacou que a igreja em Portugal é \"chamada a ser uma Igreja Eucarística\", ou seja, que \"não se coloca a si mesma como prioridade\" e \"que valoriza a participação de todos os batizados, que reconhece o papel do ministério ordenado, que cuida dos seus pastores e os acarinha\" e que \"lê com profecia o lugar da mulher na Igreja\".\n\"A Igreja Eucarística é uma igreja de `portas abertas`, que se apresenta mais como experiência de serviço amoroso à vida, em vez da rigidez dos juízos que excluem\", salientou o prefeito do Dicastério para a Cultura e a Educação da Santa Sé, no discurso a que a agência Lusa teve acesso.\nPara Tolentino de Mendonça, a igreja em Portugal é também \"samaritana\". \"Uma igreja que atualiza a linguagem da compaixão. Uma igreja de proximidade, não indiferente nem esquiva, mas capaz de fazer suas (...) as alegrias e as esperanças, as tristezas e as angústias dos homens de hoje, sobretudo dos pobres e todos aqueles que sofrem\", destacou.\nEsta é uma igreja \"especialista em humanidade que, como insiste o Papa Francisco, `não aponta o dedo, mas abre os braços`\", acrescentou.\n\"No ano em que celebramos 50 anos da democracia portuguesa, voltamos a celebrar o congresso eucarístico para repensar o contributo da Igreja na nossa sociedade em acelerada transformação\", afirmou o cardeal.\nPara Tolentino de Mendonça, esta é a igreja que \"experimenta desafios epocais tão grandes, como as alianças intergeracionais e interculturais a construir urgentemente no Portugal contemporâneo\".\n\"Uma aliança que garanta o pão do futuro para os jovens hoje cercados pela precariedade e o pão do amor para os mais velhos que não podem ser postos fora da equação social, porque já não são produtivos\", alertou o cardeal, propondo uma \"aliança que assente na compreensão da diversidade cultural como um enriquecimento comunitário e não como uma barreira à coletiva maturação do bem comum\".\nTolentino de Mendonça reforçou ainda que o pão pode ser \"o signo da desigualdade social, da inquietante ideologia da exclusão e do descarte\", mas também \"pode ter o perfume da paz ou estar na origem dos inúteis conflitos tóxicos e das devastadoras guerras\".\n\"O pão pode ser aquilo que une ou a ferida que violentamente separa\", constatou.\nO V Congresso Eucarístico Nacional (CEN) começou na sexta-feira, 31 de maio, no Fórum Braga, em torno do tema genérico \"Partilhar o Pão, Alimentar a Esperança\", contando com perto de 1.500 inscritos.\nA missa insere-se, também, na Peregrinação Arquidiocesana ao Sameiro, que este ano ganha uma projeção especial por coincidir com o encerrar do congresso.\nO congresso de Braga antecede o 53.º Congresso Eucarístico Internacional, que se realiza em Quito, no Equador, de 08 a 15 de setembro, subordinado ao tema \"Fraternidade para curar o mundo\".\nEYC (JLG) // PDF\nLusa/Fim",

    "text": "Entretenimiento\nEsta es la preparación a la que Karen Sevillano se enfrentó para ser presentadora en ‘La casa de los famosos’\nLa creadora de contenido se sinceró en medio de una reciente entrevista.\nPor: Redacción El País\nHace algunos días se dio a conocer que Karen Sevillano, la reconocida creadora de contenido digital que se convirtió en la ganadora de la primera temporada de La casa de los famosos Colombia, va a estar en la segunda edición del reality, siendo una de las presentadoras del espacio digital junto a Vicky Berrío, emocionando a sus seguidores y creando altas expectativas de lo que será su desempeño en este nuevo papel.\nEn conversación con Semana, la mujer de 29 años de edad reveló que le dio mucha alegría recibir la propuesta por parte del Canal RCN, y hacer parte del gigantesco equipo le permitió darse cuenta de todo el empeño que hay detrás de una producción de esta magnitud.\n“Me siento súper contenta y sobre todo tengo mucha admiración por todo este equipo tan maravilloso. De verdad que, cuando uno es participante, no se alcanza a imaginar qué tanto trabajo hay detrás de este programa. En realidad las personas solo ven a los famosos, pero detrás de eso hay un equipo trabajando también las 24/7, mucho antes de que el reality empiece y\nsiento que ahora puedo dar una opinión más aterrizada de la situación, teniendo en cuenta que ya estuve allá encerrada y como lo hemos dicho antes, quien lo vive es quien lo sabe”.\nAdicionalmente, confesó que ha tenido que recibir ayuda de profesores de diferentes áreas para mejorar sus habilidades y aprender nuevas técnicas que le permitan brillar y sentirse cómoda al pararse frente a la pantalla para poder conversar con respecto a los mejores momentos del día a día de cada uno de los participantes del formato de telerrealidad.\n“He hecho de todo, me he metido en clases hasta de\ninglés, de dicción, de manejo corporal, de pasarela, aprenderme a vestir, automaquillaje, me he metido a clases de todo para poder darle a la gente lo que espera y como siempre, queriendo que las personas que me apoyan se sientan muy orgullosas de mí”, mencionó.\nPese a que muchos usuarios de internet están interesados en conocer con que famosos se siente identificada o a cuál le gustaría ver a la final, Karen manifestó que aunque ya conoce a la gran mayoría, tiene que esperar a ver su comportamiento en la casa, antes de tomar una decisión.\n“Todavía no tengo ningún participante favorito, quiero entrar a ver porque, una cosa es hablar desde afuera, pero cuando están adentro uno puede ver como es que es la cosa realmente”, finalizó.\nRegístrate gratis al boletín diario de noticias\nTe puede gustar",
