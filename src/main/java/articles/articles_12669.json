    "text": "Former Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Matt Chapman has inked a long-term extension to stay in San Francisco with the Giants. Per Jeff Passan of ESPN on social media: BREAKING: Third baseman Matt Chapman and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a six-year, $151 million contract extension, sources tell ESPN. It wipes out the final two years of his current deal and keeps Chapman from opting out. Chapman is having a very good season with the Giants. He's hitting .247 with 22 homers and 69 RBI. He's posted a .778 OPS and a 121 OPS+. Lifetime, he's a .241 hitter with 177 homers. In the eighth year of his career, Chapman has played for the Oakland Athletics and Toronto Blue Jays, in addition to San Francisco. He is a one-time All-Star, a four-time Gold Glover and a two-time Platinum Glove winner. He spent two years with the Jays, helping them advance to the playoffs in both 2022 and 2023. He hit 44 combined homers in the two seasons and won a Gold Glove in 2023. This contract is not without risk for the Giants given that Chapman is 31 and will be 32 next year. Passan reports that there are no opt-outs and no deferred money, either. Age is likely the reason why the Blue Jays did not entertain bringing Chapman back this year. Chapman was signed this past off-season along with Blake Snell. Snell is expected to opt-out and test free agency again but perhaps the Giants could try to lock him up long-term as well. The Giants are taking on the Diamondbacks on Thursday afternoon. Follow Fastball On SI on social media Continue to follow our Fastball On SI coverage on social media by liking us on @FastballFN .",

    "text": "A Fruit juice company and its owner have been fined $742,139 for tainted National School Lunch Program products and other food safety breaches.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated the case, which highlighted that the produce and concentrate handled by the company were kept in filthy and unsanitary conditions.\nFruit juice manufacturer Valley Processing Inc. (VPI), based in Sunnyside, Washington, was the focus of the FDA case and the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA) breach.\nNational School Lunch Program fruit juice producer fined “Bliesner and her company, Valley Processing, produced juice in filthy and unsafe conditions, mis-labeled that product, and then sold it to the National School Lunch Program that serves low-income school children,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.\nThe report said Mary Ann Bliesner, the company’s eighty-three-year-old owner, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA), including failing to register a food facility with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nShe was also held accountable for a misdemeanor FDCA violation in connection with failing to “prevent and correct VPI’s introduction of adulterated grape juice concentrate into interstate commerce, including grape juice concentrate that was delivered to a customer for use in the National School Lunch Program.”\nAs a result, the company pleaded guilty to conspiracy to “introduce adulterated and misbranded fruit juice into interstate commerce,” including the sale of non-regulated or checked produce like fruit juice to customers.\nThe Justice Department report presented a key point that highlighted VPI’s negligence in preparing the fruit juice. It stated that the company stored blended grape juice concentrate outside its facility for years.\nThis product, which would be given to school children as part of the National School Lunch Program, was “exposed to the elements, with newer grape juice concentrate, and sold the resulting blended grape juice product to unsuspecting customers as if it were new product.”\nThe company’s owner and staff did not register a facility under “Grape Road”. As part of an FDA investigation in May 2018, staff gave false information about the facility. VIP staff had “placed caution tape over the entrance to the room at the Grape Road Facility with the concrete storage vats. VPI employees then told FDA investigators that the facility was unsafe to enter and that it contained no juice or juice products.”\nIt was found that these vats contained juice “contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying remains of animals, mold, yeast and other contaminants. FDA inspectors also observed and photographed a live rat walking across the hardened crust that had formed on top of the grape juice concentrate.”\nImage: Pexels .",

    "text": "Manchester United derrotou o Southampton, o lanterna-vermelha da Premier League, e subiu ao 12.º lugar da tabela, mas apanhou um grande susto\nDepois de duas grandes exibições em Anfield e no Emirates, o Manchester United deu um grande passo em frente ao voltar a vencer em Old Trafford, onde perdeu os últimos três jogos. No entanto, o resultado diante do Southampton , lanterna-vermelha, foi muito, muito melhor que a exibição (3-1) e chegou apenas muito perto do final.\nAté nem foi um mau início de partida para a equipa de Ruben Amorim, mas ao longo da primeira parte foram perdendo protagonismo e o adversário conseguiu criar bastantes oportunidades de golo claras. Onana fez de tudo para que a sua equipa não fosse ao intervalo em desvantagem, tendo impedido o golo de Mateus Fernandes (titular), Sulemana e Dibling, em várias ocasiões, duas delas de forma espetacular e consecutiva, mas isso acabou por acontecer num lance caricato.\nNovamente de bola parada, os Red Devils sofreram o 10.º golo de canto da temporada na liga inglesa e foi um autogolo de… Manuel Ugarte . A bola bateu nas costas do uruguaio, ex- Sporting , e traiu o seu guarda-redes, que ainda tocou nela, mas não impediu que entrasse na sua baliza. Curiosamente, este foi o primeiro golo de canto dos Saints , esta época.\nManchester sofre novamente de canto 😯 #DAZNPremier pic.twitter.com/JwoKBt1XjT\n— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) January 16, 2025 O técnico português tentou reagir ao intervalo e no início do segundo tempo, com as entradas de Antony , Zirkzee e Collyer, sendo que o brasileiro falhou de forma inacreditável o golo, um pouco depois, mas a situação não melhorou até… ao minuto 80, num golo um pouco caído do céu. Amad Diallo , com um pouco de sorte à mistura, igualou o marcador e fez renascer Old Trafford.\nSobre aproveitar ressaltos 🤌 Amad Diallo #DAZNPremier pic.twitter.com/pJwdsXD0gV\n— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) January 16, 2025 Com o público novamente ao lado dos jogadores e com os forasteiros a não conseguirem lidar com a pressão, o costa-marfinense provocou mesmo a reviravolta no marcador, após uma grande assistência de Eriksen , acabado de entrar.\nO herói de Manchester: Amad Diallo 🔥 #DAZNPremier pic.twitter.com/86Q4L2mT2h\n— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) January 16, 2025 O terceiro surgiu já no tempo de compensação e após um erro gravíssimo de Harwood-Bellis, que recebeu a bola de Ramsdale e não a conseguiu dominar. O jovem de 22 anos aproveitou e completou o hat-trick, de baliza aberta.\nHat-trick do craque Diallo 🎩 #DAZNPremier pic.twitter.com/YGMlqIxMdy\n— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) January 16, 2025 Com estes três pontos, o Man. United salta do 15.º lugar para o 12.º, ultrapassando, inclusive, o Tottenham , que perdeu o dérbi do norte de Londres, enquanto o Southampton continua com apenas seis pontos em 21 jornadas e no último lugar da tabela classificativa.",

    "text": "Despite a long and winding route to get to the Caymanas Golf Club in St Catherine, patrons came out in their numbers at the second staging of the Umbrella Evening Brunch last Sunday. American rapper Rick Ross and dancehall artistes Pablo YG and Ding Dong Ravers were the advertised acts and, despite the late start of the performances, patrons didn't seem to mind. They immersed themselves into the musical arsenal that Bada Bling, alongside his DJs Likkle Rich and Keno Russian, unleashed in abundance. Also in good form musically were Bishop Escobar, Chris Dymond, and Chub Roc Team Wire. Former Magnum Queen of the dancehall titleholder Suspense was the first act to take the stage. Despite winning the competition seven years ago, Suspense showed no sign of slowing down and went to work, representing the females. She got a warm reception from members of the audience. St Ann-based Pablo YG, who hasn't performed often in Kingston, said he was excited to be a part of the Umbrella Evening Brunch line-up. \"It's always a great vibe performing fi mi people dem. It was a good vibe and the fans showed me a lot of love,\" Pablo YG disclosed in an interview with the Jamaica Observer shortly after he finished his performance. The deejay, who has been riding high over the past year, dropped the hits Rich N Richer, Feelings, among other songs. Ding Dong and his Ravers Clavers crew rolled out the hits, though their set seemed abbreviated. They were joined onstage by Florida-based Popeye Caution for Di Good Ting Dem, which sent the crowd into overdrive. A crowd favourite, rapper Rick Ross could do no wrong. He incorporated Jamaican choreography into his routine and this went down well with members of the audience. His breakthrough hit, 2006's Hustlin was well-received, so too were You the Boss, Gold Roses, and Push It. Umbrella Evening Brunch promoter Okice Davis said, based on the demand and feedback from the previous staging of the event in August, he decided to have a second staging. \"It was based on the momentum from the last one that we had in August; it was overwhelming. The people were just so receptive at what we had to offer, so we had to come back in December,\" said Davis. He added, \"A traditional brunch is just too laid back, and we wanted to add more flavour to it and make it more energetic. People want entertainment and Umbrella Evening Brunch is just providing quality entertainment.\" Asked why Rick Ross was chosen to headline the event, co-organiser Andre Lyn said: \"The people love Rick Ross and he loves Jamaica. As you saw for yourself, he didn't even want to leave the stage.\" Davis said there are several acts being considered to headline the next staging, which is scheduled for August 2024. \"We do have a wish list with a couple names in mind. We're gonna go back to the drawing board and see how we can improve on this one and minimise our errors from this staging,\" said Davis. Lyn declined to disclose the investment that went into putting the event together. He, however, said: \"It was a sizable investment.\" \"We are pleased with the turnout of patrons, the performances by the artistes, and DJs were exceptional and everyone got value for their money. I'm just thankful for having this event,\" said Davis. HOUSE RULES - We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.
