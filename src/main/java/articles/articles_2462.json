    "text": "Superclásico Boca-River, el gran duelo del fútbol argentino el fin de semana El encuentro se jugará este sábado, a partir de las 15:00, en La Bombonera. Corresponde a la fecha 15 de la liga profesional Protagonistas de una rivalidad centenaria y cargada de cruces históricos, Boca Juniors y River Plate animarán este sábado otro episodio del Superclásico del fútbol argentino en La Bombonera, en la decimoquinta fecha de la liga profesional. El duelo entre los clubes más populares de Argentina encuentra a los rivales eternos igualados en la tabla de posiciones con 21 puntos y lejos del puntero Vélez (30), aunque el clima es muy distinto de un lado y del otro. Boca, el local, viene de perder un clásico contra Racing (2-1) que volvió a dejarlo lejos de los primeros puestos, inmerso en una campaña irregular, en la que el entrenador Diego Martínez se ha quedado con poco crédito, por lo que un triunfo puede hacerle recuperar apoyo, pero una caída en La Bombonera tendría un costo muy duro para su continuidad. El equipo azul y oro se muestra muy fuerte en su estadio, donde ganó 13 de sus últimos 17 partidos, pero disminuye notoriamente su juego fuera de casa, con tres meses sin victorias como visitante (cuatro empates y cuatro derrotas) en las últimas salidas de su casa. Eliminado prematuramente de la Copa Sudamericana en octavos de final, al Xeneize sólo le quedan por delante la Liga y la Copa Argentina como últimas opciones para festejar y conseguir la clasificación a la próxima Copa Libertadores. En cambio, River está en los cuartos de final de la Libertadores, liderado por Marcelo Gallardo y con perspectivas de seguir en carrera luego de rescatar un empate 1-1 en la visita a Colo Colo de Chile. - River alerta - El superclásico encuentra al Millonario medio de una serie copera con expectativas de lograr la clasificación a las semifinales en el desquite que se jugará el martes en el Monumental de Buenos Aires. Pero, mientras tanto, Gallardo no quiere descuidar el duelo contra el archienemigo, con la certeza de que una victoria a domicilio le puede dar un impulso enorme de cara a la recta final del campeonato. Muy posiblemente el DT deba hacer cambios para jugar en La Bombonera, ya que Maxi Meza padece una lesión muscular, y también debe evaluar qué otros jugadores debe preservar para el desquite contra Colo Colo, que llegará apenas 72 horas después del superclásico. El historial global entre Boca y River por la Liga local registra 262 cotejos, con 92 triunfos para los Xeneizes, 86 para los Millonarios y 84 empates. El último choque fue en abril pasado, por los cuartos de final de la Copa de la Liga, con triunfo de los auriazules (3-2) en Córdoba. El Superclásico se jugará el sábado desde las 15:00 (HB), como eje central de una jornada que arrancará el viernes con Gimnasia-Riestra y Unión-Godoy Cruz, y seguirá después del superclásico en la noche del sábado con Instituto-Barracas, Newell’s-Tigre y Defensa-San Lorenzo. El domingo jugarán Huracán-Lanús, Independiente-Argentinos, Talleres-Racing, Atlético Tucumán-Belgrano y Platense-Rosario Central, mientras que el lunes completarán Sarmiento-Central Córdoba, Banfield-Independiente Rivadavia y Vélez, el puntero, contra Estudiantes.",

    "title": "The Complete Guide to Stevia Leaf Extract: A Natural Sweetener for Health-Conscious Living",
    "text": "In the search for healthier sugar alternatives, stevia leaf extract has emerged as a popular choice for those looking to cut down on calories without compromising on sweetness. Derived from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, this natural sweetener offers zero calories, is 200–300 times sweeter than sugar, and is packed with potential health benefits. This guide will cover everything you need to know about stevia leaf extract, including its origins, types, health benefits, uses, and how to safely incorporate it into your diet.\nWhat is Stevia Leaf Extract?\nStevia leaf extract is a natural sweetener extracted from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant, native to South America. For centuries, indigenous communities in Paraguay and Brazil have used stevia leaves as a sweetener and herbal remedy. The sweet taste of stevia comes from compounds known as steviol glycosides , particularly rebaudioside A and stevioside, which are responsible for its intense sweetness without calories or a spike in blood sugar.\nCommercial stevia leaf extract is usually produced by drying the stevia leaves, steeping them in water, and then refining the extract to isolate the steviol glycosides. This extraction process results in a highly concentrated, versatile sweetener that can be used in a wide range of foods and beverages.\nTypes of Stevia Leaf Extract\nThere are several forms of stevia available on the market, each with unique characteristics suited for different culinary applications:\nPure Stevia Extract : This is the most concentrated form, containing over 95% steviol glycosides. It’s extremely sweet, so only a tiny amount is needed to sweeten foods and beverages. Stevia Blends : Many stevia products are blended with other sweeteners like erythritol or monk fruit extract. These blends often have a more balanced taste profile, making them less likely to have the slight bitterness some people detect in pure stevia. They are also often easier to measure, resembling sugar in volume. Liquid Stevia : Liquid stevia is a convenient form of the extract, often used to sweeten beverages. It’s available in different flavors (like vanilla or chocolate) to add variety to drinks and desserts. Whole Leaf Powder : The least processed form, whole leaf stevia powder retains more of the plant’s natural components. While it’s a natural option, it is less refined than pure stevia extracts, often resulting in a greenish color and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Health Benefits of Stevia Leaf Extract\nQherb plant extract Stevia leaf extract provides numerous health benefits, making it a favorite among those looking to reduce sugar intake:\n1. Calorie-Free Sweetness\nOne of the primary appeals of stevia leaf extract is that it offers sweetness without calories. This makes it a fantastic option for people on calorie-restricted diets, including those looking to lose weight or maintain their weight.\n2. Helps Manage Blood Sugar Levels\nStevia is naturally non-glycemic, meaning it doesn’t raise blood sugar levels. Unlike regular sugar, stevia is not absorbed by the body in the same way, making it a safe option for people with diabetes or those aiming to stabilize their blood sugar levels.\n3. Supports Oral Health\nSugar is a major contributor to cavities, but because stevia doesn’t promote the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay, it’s a much better choice for maintaining oral health. It’s even used in some toothpastes and mouthwashes as a natural sweetener.\n4. Antioxidant Properties\nStevia leaves contain antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals, which can protect cells from oxidative stress and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\n5. May Improve Blood Pressure\nSome research suggests that compounds in stevia may help relax blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. However, further studies are needed to confirm the long-term effects of stevia on blood pressure.\nUses of Stevia Leaf Extract\nStevia leaf extract can be used in various ways, both in cooking and everyday life:\n1. Sweetening Beverages\nStevia is a popular addition to beverages like coffee, tea, smoothies, and lemonades. It provides a zero-calorie sweetness that works well in hot and cold drinks, though you may need to experiment with the amount to avoid an overly sweet taste.\n2. Baking and Cooking\nStevia can be used in a range of recipes, including desserts, sauces, dressings, and marinades. However, because it doesn’t caramelize or add bulk like sugar, it’s best suited for recipes that don’t rely on sugar’s textural qualities. For baking, consider using a stevia blend specifically designed for baking, which often includes other ingredients to mimic the behavior of sugar.\n3. Homemade Condiments\nStevia can be used to make healthier versions of condiments, such as ketchup, salad dressings, and syrups. Since these items often contain added sugars, substituting with stevia helps cut down on unnecessary calories.\n4. Sugar Replacement in Snacks and Desserts\nUse stevia in yogurt, oatmeal, pudding, or fruit salads for a healthy touch of sweetness. It’s also a good way to sweeten popsicles, ice cream, and other frozen treats.\nTips for Using Stevia Leaf Extract\nWhile stevia leaf extract is an excellent sugar substitute, there are a few tips to help you get the best results:\nStart Small : Stevia is much sweeter than sugar, so you only need a small amount. Start with a pinch or a few drops and adjust according to your taste. Experiment with Blends : If pure stevia tastes too intense or slightly bitter, consider using a stevia blend. These products often balance sweetness better and are easier to use in recipes that call for sugar. Be Mindful of Aftertaste : Some people detect a slight aftertaste with stevia, which can be more noticeable in higher amounts. Blending it with other ingredients can help minimize this aftertaste. Check Conversion Ratios : Since stevia is much sweeter than sugar, it’s essential to follow conversion guidelines. Most packaging provides a conversion chart, which can help you achieve the right sweetness. Combine with Other Sweeteners for Baking : When baking, you can combine stevia with other low-calorie sweeteners, like erythritol, to better replicate sugar’s texture and sweetness. Safety and Considerations\nStevia leaf extract is generally considered safe for consumption and is approved for use by health authorities in various countries. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:\nAllergic Reactions : Although rare, some individuals may have allergic reactions to stevia. If you experience any unusual symptoms after consuming it, consult a healthcare professional. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding : While stevia is generally considered safe, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before adding any new sweeteners to their diet. Kidney Health : Because stevia contains compounds that act as diuretics, it may increase urination frequency. People with kidney issues should check with a doctor before using stevia regularly. Dosage : While stevia is safe for most people, consuming it in very high quantities could lead to mild gastrointestinal symptoms in some individuals. Stick to recommended servings for best results. Choosing the Best Stevia Leaf Extract\nNot all stevia products are created equal. When shopping for stevia leaf extract, consider the following:\nPurity : Look for products that contain 95% or higher steviol glycosides, as these are purer and have a more consistent sweetness. No Added Sugars : Some stevia products contain added sugars or fillers. Check the ingredient list to ensure you’re getting pure stevia or a blend with sugar-free alternatives. Certified Organic and Non-GMO : For those seeking the cleanest option, certified organic and non-GMO stevia products are widely available and meet high quality standards. Conclusion\nStevia leaf extract is a versatile, calorie-free sweetener that offers a range of benefits for health-conscious individuals. Its ability to provide natural sweetness without raising blood sugar makes it an excellent choice for people with diabetes, those looking to manage their weight, and anyone aiming to reduce their sugar intake. By understanding its types, health benefits, and best practices for use, you can enjoy the sweetness of stevia in a wide variety of recipes, from morning coffee to desserts.\nWith stevia leaf extract in your kitchen, you’ll have a healthier, natural alternative that supports both your taste buds and wellness goals. Whether you’re a health enthusiast, a diabetic, or just looking to cut back on sugar, stevia can be a beneficial addition to your daily routine.",

The Australian national team’s 6-5 win in Nice comes as a welcome relief following their devastating 3-0 loss at the hands of Germany in Marseille last week.\nDespite legendary player Sam Kerr unable to play this Olympic year due to an ACL injury, fans are optimistic about captain Steph Catley’s formidable side, with Catley herself, as well as forward Caitlin Foord and midfielder Katrina Gorry having all recovered from respective injuries just in time.\nThe most recent match saw the Matildas come back from a tense halftime, when they were trailing Zambia 2-4. But our underdogs rallied, with Michelle Heyman and Catley clawing back from behind to score four goals in a thrilling second half to win the match.\nEarlier in Marseilles, Germany — who are ranked No. 4 in the world — were ruthless going forward, and perhaps could have scored more goals had the Matildas not leapt to defence. Need we remind fans that Australia also haven’t beaten Germany in almost two decades, so it was never going to be an easy first game. Now, the Tillies have one last preliminary match to show off their chops, and it won’t be an easy one, as they face off team USA, who knocked them into fourth place in Tokyo.\nBelow, we round up how you can cheer on the Matildas with upcoming games and where to watch them — and what they’ll need to do to earn a podium finish at the Olympics .\nRelated : Everything Australian viewers need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympic Games\nINSTAGRAM / @MATILDAS When do the Matildas play at the Olympics?

We have two more games and we have to turn it around quickly. We have a lot to learn from here. I think at times we were well on top and let two set pieces affect the game in a very negative way. There are things that we can fix nice and quickly, which is good. But we just need to be better.”\nCatley continued by saying the Matildas need to learn from their preliminary game mistakes, as they continue their Olympics campaign. “They are a good team. We did it to ourselves in the end. We conceded two set pieces. We are usually much, much better on set pieces. It is a wake-up call and it is not to our standard and we need to be better for the next game and turn in this tournament around.”\nRelated : Ellie Carpenter: On a mission\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Matildas (@matildas)\nWhen are the Matildas next games at the Olympics?

Their game is at 7pm Paris time, which falls in the devastatingly early hours of the morning for us at 3am AEST.\nWhen are the football finals at the Olympics? If the Matildas qualify (crossing our fingers and toes!) they’ll be up for the following rounds:\nSaturday—Sunday, August 3-4: Quarter-finals Tuesday, August 7: Semi-finals Friday, August 9: Bronze medal match Sunday, August 11: Gold medal match\nHow to watch the Matildas 2024 Olympics matches You’ll be able to tune into all the Matildas action via the Nine Network, which this year holds the Olympics broadcasting rights. You’ll be able to watch each of their games live and free (if you’re so inclined for that 3am wake-up) on more than 40 of Nine’s free-to-air channels. If you prefer a sleep-in, you can catch up on highlights via the broadcaster’s 9Now streaming platform.\nFor the first time, local streamer Stan will also broadcast the Olympics — all games, ad-free, live and on-demand.\nAnd if you prefer to watch the games away from home, there’s a slew of venues and public spaces across the country showcasing the games — from Federation Square in Melbourne’s CBD to The Tumbalong Park Sound Shell at Darling Harbour in Sydney.\nRelated : A psychologist explains why the Matildas have suddenly awoken your inner sports fan\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Matildas (@matildas)\nWhat are the Matildas ranked in the world? According to the most recent FIFA Women’s World Ranking, the Matildas are currently ranked 12th in the world. World No. 1 goes to Spain, with France in second place, England in third and Germany in fourth.\nHave the Matildas ever won an Olympic medal before? The Matildas haven’t secured a Olympic medal before — but they did come close at the last Olympics. At Tokyo 2021, the girls just lost the bronze medal to USA, earning a fourth place position.\nRelated : The CommBank Matildas suit up in local label BEARE PARK before playing to a record home crowd in Sydney",

    "title": "#164 Valencianos explotan contra una nueva actividad para turistas en la que recorren la ciudad bailando",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#33](c33#c-33) pueden bailar lo que les de la gana en su casa… o en un sitio que sea para bailar. Y a mi esto me parece que está muy bien para que pase un día o dos. El tener a unos colgados con cascos todos los dias delante de tu casa haciendo el mongol no creo que sea agradable.\n[#106](c106#c-106) Ese es el que es público, que cualquiera por 18€ se puede apuntar. Los privados de las DESPEDIDAS, CUMPLEAÑOS, EMPRESAS, que anuncian en sus páginas no cuentan para molestar, verdad?\n[#28](c28#c-28) Tienes un vídeo en la noticia.\nOcupan bastante espacio público y como actividad turística no tiene micho sentido, pero claro, en el tiempo en que nos ha tocado vivir donde hay que presumir de hacer algo \"distinto\" y por supuesto colgarlo/comentarlo en las redes sociales...\n[#31](c31#c-31) Me apostaría 100€ a que si por tu barrio pasaran estos grupos cada 10 min haciendo el monguer serías el primero en cagarte en la puta madre de todos los santos.\n[#57](c57#c-57) No sé las drogas, las armas y el juego generan mucho dinero, pero estas si parece que se pueden criticar\n[#67](c67#c-67) si que molestan, están usando una gran porción de la vía para un evento privado. Además de ser ruidoso y molesto, hay quien no le puede agradar que una visita a una cuidad se convierta en un musical.\n[#78](c78#c-78) Pues un poco Sí, porque los demás también aguantarán TUS ESTUPIDECES en algún momento.\nSi vas a cenar a una terraza - Molestas a los vecinos que se levantan a las 5AM\nSi tus hijos juegan con un balón en el parque - Molestan a los ancianitos que le dan de comer a las palomas...\nY así todo.\nSi no sois capaces de aguantar nada iros a vivir al campo o como ermitaños.\n[#116](c116#c-116) el parque es un sitio de juegos.\nSi quieren hacer zoomba que vayan al parque o un gimnasio.\nLo de la terraza lo veo igual de mal.\nPuedes estar en una terraza sin tener que estar a gritos, también.\n[#116](c116#c-116) > porque los demás también aguantarán TUS ESTUPIDECES\nNo. Por lo general, al estar dotado de dignidad, evito hacer estupideces en público.\n> Si vas a cenar a una terraza - Molestas a los vecinos que se levantan a las 5AM\nSi ceno en un restaurante evito las terrazas. Paso de aguantar el humo ajeno, ruido de tráfico, cucarachas y contenedores de la basura a dos pasos.\n> Si tus hijos juegan con un balón en el parque - Molestan a los ancianitos que le dan de comer a las palomas...\n¿Me estás comparando estos \"adultos\" con niños de unos pocos años? Te lo compro. No dan para más.\n> Si no sois capaces de aguantar nada iros a vivir al campo o como ermitaños.\nQue se vaya a vivir al campo el que molesta, no el que intenta vivir tranquilo.\n[#69](c69#c-69) Primero los ciclistas, luego los patinetes, ahora los turistas con cascos el gran problema de seguridad vial.\n[#64](c64#c-64) hasta que quieres salir del portal y te encuentras a 15 monguers caminando a ritmo de Thriller (tres pasitos, manos. Tres pasitos, manos)...\n[#1](c1#c-1) También te digo una cosa, entre estos y las despedidas de soltero/a con escándalos impresionantes a cualquier hora me quedo con lo primero.\nLo que si me parece de cárcel es el \"uniforme\" que le han puesto a los guías, un cruce entre un limón y el chavo del ocho\n[#49](c49#c-49) El otro día en el trabajo un americano me preguntó: \"¿ A dónde va un Español cuando quiere ir de vacaciones? \"\nMe cago en los muertos de catetos y caciques que han apostado fuertesimo al turismo.\n[#155](c155#c-155) Si veis como algo positivo que seamos el resort de occidente, que de puertas para afuera solo somos turismo, pues fale 😀\nA ver la frase fue mas bien \"A donde vas de vacaciones cuando vives en España\"\n[#157](c157#c-157) pues ya te digo, desde la distancia y sin conoceros ni a tu compañero ni a ti, me parece un pregunta fruto de la curiosidad.\n[#4](c4#c-4)\nResumir la avalancha de turismo que se sufre en muchas capitales de éste país diciendo que les molesta que la gente se lo pase bien es demagogia nivel dios.\nTodo tiene un límite, las ciudades también, y en muchas están superando el límite de convivencia y de capacidad para que una ciudad siga siendo y funcionando para que sus habitantes vivan.\nSe tomarán medidas contra ésta locura, no lo dudo, porque es un problema que crece al mismo ritmo que la mala educación de la gente.\nEsta crítica refleja el sentimiento de una parte de la población que se siente marginada en su propia ciudad, desplazada por actividades que, aunque novedosas y atractivas para los visitantes, alteran la vida cotidiana de los residentes.\nLa controversia en torno a Bailaloloco Silent Disco Tour es solo un ejemplo más del complejo equilibrio que Valencia intenta mantener entre el desarrollo turístico y la preservación de su identidad y calidad de vida para sus habitantes.\nSuena a ChatGPT.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Ingresos para quién y cómo? Cada actividad humana tiene diferentes externalidades negativas, en el caso del turismo las estamos viendo ahora y estamos decidiendo si las queremos o no.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No estoy en contra, quizás deben limitar el número de asistentes para que no molesten tanto. Se ve que el grupo es bastante grande.\n¿\"Los valencianos explotan\"?, ¿cuántos valencianos?, porque en la no-noticia recopila 3 opiniones de internet, y ya está.\n[#141](c141#c-141) Creo que incluso puede ser un publireportaje, que en estos tiempos de SEO agresivo nunca se sabe, y aparece el nombre de la empresa y el precio del servicio\nSe ha vendido el país (su arquitectura, paisajes, hasta las casas mismas...) y los beneficios han ido a cuatro empresarios hoteleros. Muerte a este modelo!!!\n[#20](c20#c-20) Amen por esa ultima frase.\nA mi el turismo solo me quita capacidad de consumo.\nQue si, que los hosteleros pagan impuestos. Pero en Valencia ya no puedo tomarme una birra por 1,5€, y alwuilar una casa ni te cuento.\nEl ser humano cuando se convierte en turista está demostrado que se vuelve (o nos volvemos, no quiero ser más que nadie) gilipollas, bailar por la calle como un poseso, ir por el centro de la calle para hacerte fotos(salir de casa te pone la armadura de Ironman, si te atropella un 🚕 no duele), beber sin control....\n[#123](c123#c-123) para empezar usan la vía pública para dar un servicio que bloquea e invade con ruido y espacio.\nNo es muy diferente que un a terraza delante de un bar. Solo que estas mierdas son móviles.\nLuego, y esto ya es más subjetivo, está en disonancia con una visita turística.\nUna cosa es una visita turística y otra hacer deporte y baile. Las dos ala vez es un sinsentido. Que te gusta ver a gente haciendo el canelo? Perfecto. A mí me disgusta y me fuerza a no estar cerca, porque me produce rechazo y vergüenza. Además de ser una afrenta al patrimonio de una ciudad, hacer una visita haciendo el tolai.",

    "text": "MARION — Superintendent Michael S. Nelson is pleased to announce that Sippican Elementary School has partnered with the Marion Institute to participate in the Grow Education Farm-to-School (Grow FTS) program for the second year in a row.\n“We are very happy to partner for another year with the Marion Institute to offer this program to students,” said Superintendent Nelson. “Our students and staff enjoyed the first year, discovering new healthy habits and learning from Grow FTS leaders. They had many fun and hands-on educational experiences while beautifying the Sippican School grounds.”\nThe Marion Institute’s Grow FTS program works within school districts to build a more equitable food system that promotes ecological literacy, health and sustainability. It supports teachers, engages families and educates students in creating healthier eating and living habits. This program currently partners with 23 regional elementary schools, serving students and staff in grades three and four in four school districts.\nGrow FTS and the Sippican School are working together to provide another year of positive learning experiences for students.\nYear two consists of much of the same programming as the previous year, including outdoor classroom activities and providing a curriculum that directly correlates with classroom lessons and professional development for staff members. This year, the Grow FTS program will reinforce the importance of nutrition, healthy eating and living habits more intensely. Additionally, the Marion Institute recently partnered with AmeriCorps staff to place a FoodCorps member in the school at least twice a week to directly oversee the lessons embedded into the classroom, the cafeteria and the community.\nDuring the first Grow FTS, Sippican Elementary School’s third-grade students and teachers were supported by Nate Sander, the Marion Institute’s Grow Education Program Manager, for outdoor garden lessons throughout the school year. Students learned about science while beautifying their school by planting a variety of fast growing crops in Sippican’s newly-built raised gardening beds. They learned how the sun and soil work together to produce an environment conducive for plants to grow and thrive.\n“We are thrilled to be working with the Sippican Elementary School again,” said Marion Institute Executive Director Liz Wiley. “The students, teachers and administration have all been so supportive and welcoming. Sippican was the site of our very first Grow Education garden. Since then, our program has expanded to include year-round farm-to-school lessons that utilize the gardens as outdoor classrooms that excite and engage students to learn more about where their food comes from, how it is grown and why making healthy food choices matter to their bodies and the environments.”\nThroughout the program’s first year, third-graders and staff members attended “virtual field trips” and heard from guest speakers involved in the program during the winter months. Sippican students conducted a butterfly study and spring planting, as well as a harvest workshop and a planting workshop this summer.\nAbout the Grow Education Program\nThe Marion Institute launched Grow Education Farm-to-School (Grow FTS) programming to support teachers, engage families and educate students in creating healthier eating and living habits. The Marion Institute works in partnership with school districts to build a more equitable food system that promotes ecological literacy, health and sustainability while covering the plant life-cycle curriculum. The Grow FTS program has partnered with many school districts including New Bedford and Westport, Wareham and Old Rochester Regional School District.\n###",
