    "text": "[News](https://newsday.co.tt/category/news) Flash flooding in north, east, central after heavy rain [Yvonne Webb](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/yvonne_webb) ROADS were turned into rivers on Thursday afternoon as a heavy downpour resulted in flash flooding in parts of North, East and Central Trinidad. The northbound lanes of the Uriah Butler Highway at Chaguanas as well as the eastbound lanes of the Churchill Roosevelt Highway near Macoya and parts of the Priority Bus Route at Tunapuna became nearly impassable as high tides prevented the run-off. The Disaster Management Unit (DMU) warned of traffic jams and asked motorists to be careful. The warning came a little too late as some motorists, caught unawares in the absence of any weather alerts from the Meteorological Office, tried to meander their way through the swirling flood waters. Fire officers were called to rescue a woman and her daughters from their car, which stalled in the flooded area near Eleanor Road and Market Street, Chaguanas. That Borough was one of the worst hit areas as knee-high water engulfed Caroni Savannah Road, near the corner of Medford Gas Station, IDC street, Endeavour Avenue, Xavier Street 10th Avenue and St Yves Street. Presentation College, Chaguanas, was also flooded out. Chaguanas mayor Faaiq Mohammed said cleaning and restoring the school will be the priority. “I think school is set to reopen on January 2. A disaster management team will be dispatched to the school on Friday to do an assessment. If it means we have to wash down the area, we will do so. Usually, when an area is flooded out, water seeps into the septic tanks, so we may have to assist with that as well.” He said he was surprised to see knee-high water in some parts of the Borough. He said he was first alerted to the floods when someone called for sandbags as the roads became impassable. “The rains fell in big drops consistently for about one and a half hours shortly after noon.” He said the volume of water overwhelmed the drains' capacity to store and move the water. Mohammed said debris got caught in WASA lines that hang low in the drains, clogging the free flow of water. He said he would soon be engaging WASA to either remove the lines or lift them to a higher level. Replacing old culverts and ensuring zero tolerance for littering, he said, are also on the agenda for 2024. Rural Development and Local Government Minister Faris Al-Rawi did not respond to calls from Newsday, but in a brief statement, the ministry strongly advised the public to exercise caution. Anyone affected by the floods is urged to contact their relevant DMU hotline, the statement said. Mohammed said there were a few incidents after the water ran off, but while cleaning areas where water seeped into some yards will have to be done, thankfully there were no major damage or incidents.",

    "title": "‘New low in appeasement politics’: Union minister shreds Congress over Karnataka temple tax",
    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nComing down heavily on Rahul Gandhi after the Congress-ruled Karnataka on Thursday passed the contentious Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Bill 2024, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the draft resolution marked a ‘new low’ in ‘appeasement politics’.\nThe Bill mandates the state to collect 10 per cent tax from temples generating revenue exceeding Rs 1 crore and 5 per cent from shrines with revenue of between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.\nWeighing in on the draft legislation on Thursday, Chandrasekhar told ANI that the Bill was brought to fill the ‘ATM’ of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar.\nIn a personalised video message on Thursday, the BJP leader said, “While Rahul Gandhi is holding a Bharat Jodo Yatra in the country, the Congress government in Karnataka has brought the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024 in the assembly to fund the ATM of Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar. This marks a new low of appeasement politics. We will oppose this Bill.”\nCondemning the draft legislation, the BJP termed it ‘anti-Hindu’.\nThe party’s state chief and son of former chief minister and Lingayat stalwart BS Yediyurappa, BY Vijayendra, alleged that the Bill was part of a ploy by the Congress government to siphon off donations to temples in the name of taxes to fill its dwindling coffers. Corrupt, inept #LootSarkaar with its penchant for anti-Hindu ideology in the guise of secularism, has cast its evil eyes on the Temple revenues.\nThrough the Hindu Religious Endowments amendment act, it is trying to siphon off donations as well as offerings from Hindu temples and religious institutions to fill its empty coffers,” Vijayendra posted from his X handle on Thursday.\n“Accordingly, the government plans to gobble up 10 per cent of the Temple revenue exceeding Rs 1 crore & 5 per cent of Temple revenue below Rs 1 crore. This not only reflects the deplorable condition of this government but also shows its abject hate towards Hindu Dharma. Temple funds should be dedicatedly utilized for the renovation of temples and to facilitate the work beneficial to devotees, rather than diverting it for other purposes, which would be an injustice and betrayal of people’s religious beliefs,” he alleged.\n“Why only Hindu temples are targeted for revenue, leaving out other religions, is a question raised by millions of devotees. Instead of grabbing the devotees’ money, government can install “Donation Boxes” so that the concerned citizens can help this penniless govt boost its revenue as a Gesture of Goodwill!” he posted further.\nHitting back at the BJP, Karnataka minister Ramalinga Reddy told media persons, “It was BS Yediyurappa and Sadananda Gowda (former chief misters) who brought amendments to the Hindu Religious Act in 2011.\nThe amendments enabled the then government to collect money from temples. This is not ours but a Bill of the previous BJP government.",

    "text": "Car Dealership Ripped Off His Friend By Falsifying His Income, So He Gets The Dealer To Give His Friend A Car For Free\nby Matthew Gilligan\nIf you’ve ever gone through the process of buying a new\nor a used car from a dealership, you know how frustrating the whole experience can be.\nBut there are ways to deal with the shady car folks out there!\nAnd this person really nailed it.\nThey started their story by saying that they wanted to help out a friend…\nHow I got a car dealership to give my friend a “newer” car.\n“Circa January 2020 my friend makes a stupid decision and buys a brand new car he can’t afford.\nHis insurance is like $400 a month, he makes like $10.25 an hour working as a shift supervisor at McDonalds.\nHis car payment is like $795 a month.\nNow at $10.25 an hour, 30 hours a week that’s a weekly income of about $300 a week or about $1,230 a month….so yea.\nThey were trying their best to help out their friend.\nSo my friend came to me for help because I used to sell cars and know the industry pretty well.\nI go over his paperwork. The dealer did rip him off, but my friend is trying to find a way to get out of this mess.\nAnd ripping someone off isn’t illegal.\nThey did of course over charge him for warranty, they gave him a higher APR, they had add ons, etc…but none of that is illegal and I know the only way I can get my friend out of this deal is if they did something illegal.\nThey got an idea.\nSo I look at his finance application that my friend signed, it correctly listed his income.\nWhich turned a light bulb on in my head.\nNo bank is going to approve someone for a $795 car payment if they are only making $1,200 a month. It does not make mathematical sense to do that.\nSo I start searching through his paperwork for the finance app the dealer submitted to the bank.\nYou often times when you submit a finance application at a dealership the dealership will take the hand filled out application and reproduce it electronically.\nThis is pretty normal.\nA little white lie never hurt, right?\nHowever on the application the dealer submitted to the bank the dealer said my friend was a GM of the McDonalds and made $70,000.\nMy friend had good credit, so it doesn’t appear like the bank asked for proof of income.\nSo I go to the dealership with my friend and tell the sales manager he’s going want to put me in touch with the GM because we are going be unwinding my friends deal and giving his trade in back.\nThe sales manager thought I was joking, the GM also thought I was joking.\nThen I demonstrated how his dealership finance department committed bank fraud. I showed the GM the finance app my friend filled out. I then showed the GM the finance app his dealership submitted to the bank and pointed at the income difference. My friend really made $14k a year, the dealership claimed my friend made $70k a year. That’s bank fraud, that’s a felony, lets keep this simple shall we.\nThe GM sees his dealership is in a load of ****. The proof I am presenting to him is rock solid. He knows it, I know it, we are all on the same page.\nHe was ready to drop a bomb on the GM.\nHe goes “ok…so what can I do to make this right?”\nI go “Unwind the deal give me my friend his trade in back.”\nUnwinding the deal is basically the GM agreeing to cancel the deal, and basically erasing the deal and pretending it never happened.\nGM tries to avoid that but I remain firm and remind him we can take easily take this documentation and turn his life in a living hell. He knows i’m right. My friend also needs a car to get to work the next day.\nThe GM says he’ll check into it he comes back and tells me unfortunately they sold his trade in already. I said “That’s fine, unwind the deal and lets put my friend into something as good or slightly better then what he traded in for”\nAre you sure you really want to go there?\nSo the GM goes “So he’ll buy a car similar to his trade in?”\nI said “No, you’ll give him a car similar to his trade in.”\nThe GM goes “It doesn’t work that way.”\nI go “It does when you commit bank fraud.”\nGm is upset with me and I remind him…I’m being really nice and this situation can totally get really ugly. Like felony level charges ugly. Like losing your franchise ugly.\nSO yea this is going hurt…but it’s going hurt less my way.\nSo the GM goes alright and he looks in his inventory and he tells me they have a 2007 Focus with 10k more miles.\nI tell him “no, the car you give my friend needs to be the same or better then what he trade in.”\nThe GM counters “I’m giving him a free car.”\nI go “No, you took his trade in, you sold it, you made money on that sale, you also committed a felony in the process of selling him his new car. You are now correcting that mistake. This isn’t a free car for my friend. This is a you are correcting your mistake.”\nGM insists that’s what he’s willing to do I tell him if he can’t do better than that we will go to a consumer protection attorney and have a conversation with them.\nMy friend didn’t wanna go this route…but it was our plan B.\nWe get to get up, the GM says “Wait, give me a second.”\nThe GM goes “I have a ’08 civic, it has 5k more miles, but its a civic and not a focus. I unwind the deal on the new car, and put your friend in the civic at no extra cost.”\nWe agree.\nIt seemed like this was the best way to go…and they nailed it!\nGM has the paper drawn up, the old loan on the new car is canceled, they take in the new car again (but because it’s already titled they’ll have to sell it as used, that sucks for them).\nThey gave my friend a better car then the one he traded in.\nFor people asking why we didn’t get a lawyer involved from the start\nWe could have done that\nBut courts take a long time, and this was a faster way to fix the situation.”\nLet’s see what people had to say about this.\nThis person said they need to educate their friend about finances.\nAnother reader had a similar story to tell.\nThis Reddit user said they used to work in this industry…and they left.\nOne person shared a surprising fact.\nAnd this person shared a story about their friend…\nNice work!\nConsider us impressed!\nIf you enjoyed this story, check out this post about a\ndaughter who invited herself to her parent’s 40th anniversary vacation for all the wrong reasons.\nCategories:\nSTORIES\nTags: ·\nbusiness, buying cars, cars, customer service, money, picture, pro revenge, revenge, top",
