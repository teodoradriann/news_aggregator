    "text": "Israeli troops who accidentally shot three militant-held hostages should not have opened fire because the shooting “did not match the risk” they faced as a firefight unfolded, according to a conclusion issued Thursday by the Israeli military. The shooting took place in Gaza less than two weeks ago, shocking Israel and fueling protests aimed at pressuring the government to make a deal with Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages. “The shooting of the hostages should not have been carried out, this shooting did not match the risk and the situation,” Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi wrote. “However, it was carried out under complex circumstances, and under intense combat conditions under prolonged threat.” The three men were shirtless and had emerged from a building with a white flag when Israeli troops encountered them in Shejaiya, an area of north Gaza where clashes between the military and militants had taken place for several days. Two of the hostages were shot and killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. A commander ordered troops to cease fire, but two soldiers who did not hear the order because of noise from a nearby tank shot the third person, Halevi wrote. Only later were the bodies confirmed to be those of three Israelis, Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz. Halevi said commanders must make sure operational instructions are clear “so that we don’t kill ourselves.” “The (military) failed in the mission of rescuing the abductees in this incident,” Halevi concluded. “The entire chain of command feels responsible for the difficult event, grieves over this outcome and shares in the grief of the three families of the abductees.”",

    "text": "Tributes paid to ‘incredibly courageous’ surgeon Professor Sir Roy Calne Pioneering surgeon Professor Sir Roy Calne, who led the first liver transplant operation in Europe in 1968, has died at the age of 93. Dame Esther Rantzen has paid tribute to an “incredibly courageous” surgeon who performed the first liver transplant in Europe. The former BBC journalist said Professor Sir Roy Calne, who died on Saturday aged 93, got in touch with her to ask for help to save a two-year-old boy who had weeks to live unless he found a donor. At the time, the numbers of transplant surgeries had fallen following a BBC Panorama programme that raised concerns about the field, she said. Despite the television industry’s concerns about transplants, Sir Roy contacted Dame Esther to put young Ben Hardwick, who was suffering with biliary atresia, on her TV show That’s Life!, she told the PA news agency. Dame Esther, 83, said: “He rang That’s Life!, we got a crew together that day and (Ben’s mother) made a speech in which she said that ‘this would be the greatest gift in life, and it might be the only comfort for a family whose only baby had passed away’ – we put her on the air, with quotes from Roy Calne, and it absolutely took off. “When (Ben’s mother) came to him and said ‘how can we change public opinion?’, and he said ‘television’, – I thought that was incredible, it was forgiving of the medium and it was also right, because at that time we were able to reach so many people and the rest of the media took it up too. “Within a week a donor was found. “He was not only a brilliantly skilled surgeon but he had immense courage. “I just think he was a wonderful example of a pioneering, brilliant medical practitioner in Britain working in the NHS.” She said a philanthropist offered to take Ben to America to get help after the show aired, but she responded “You don’t need to, we’ve got Professor Calne and he will do it under the NHS”. She added: “Roy performed the surgery on Ben and other children – as a result of our story people became aware of the desperate need for transplants.” The show started their friendship, she said, adding: “I have some beautiful watercolours by (Sir Roy) in pride of place in my home. “The thing about surgeons is they’re very, very gifted, good with their hands – he was also very talented artist. “He was funny, I remember having dinner with him. “I think it was steak and kidney pie and he carefully dissected one of the kidneys, which made it quite difficult to eat. “He was excellent company, but the thing that impressed me so much was the skill he had, the profession he was dedicated to.” Mike More, chair of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), paid tribute to Sir Roy on behalf of Cambridge University Hospitals, which named a transplant unit in the city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital after the surgeon. He said: “I offer my deepest condolences to the family of Professor Sir Roy Calne. “He was a true pioneer of transplant surgery, not only carrying out many UK, European and world firsts in surgery but also inspiring future generations of clinicians. “Sir Roy leaves behind a truly amazing legacy and many of our staff will remember him with fondness for his vision and genuine kindness. We will all miss him very much.”",

    "text": "First responders rescue boy found floating on debris in floodwaters after Hurricane Milton TAMPA, Fla. (Gray News) - First responders in Florida have been busy responding to those in need after [Hurricane Milton](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-tampa-florida-08bde4b9c29460f471d43c6512821c93) tore through the state on Wednesday. According to the [Hillsborough County](https://www.facebook.com/HCSOSheriff)[ Sheriff’s Office](https://www.facebook.com/HCSOSheriff), one of its rescue calls involved a teenager who found himself on floating debris amid rising floodwaters. Deputies said the 14-year-old had to be rescued after Hurricane Milton’s floodwaters trapped him on a floating fence in the middle of Tampa. A [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1911970302618055&ref=sharing) published by the sheriff’s office showed Sheriff Chad Chronister and a deputy finding the boy floating near a neighborhood grocery store. The rescue crew spun around their boat to grab him. Chronister told [WFLA](https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/14-year-old-found-floating-on-fence-in-tampa-floodwaters-after-hurricane-milton/) that the teen had evacuated and was staying at a friend’s house. However, when he tried to walk back home after the storm he could not swim well enough to get through the deep waters. The boy was taken to dry land after the rescue and was able to return home. Millions of Florida residents have been [without power](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-tampa-florida-5f6a112986eb6e21720f0f17c504afe8) for hours after Milton reached the state. The storm spawned multiple powerful tornadoes across Florida before officially making landfall. Rescue crews said they are continuing to work around the clock. Copyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.

After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "text": "Gastgewerbe: Mehr als jeder dritte neue Angestellte bekommt mehr – Regeländerung sorgt für „spürbaren Einfluss“ bei Geringverdienern\nFür Millionen Menschen in Deutschland führt die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns zu mehr Geld. Einige Branchen und Beschäftigungsarten sind besonders betroffen. Ein Gewerkschafter sagt: „Skandalös“\nBerlin – Mehr als jeder achte neu angestellte Arbeitnehmer in Deutschland wird profitieren. Der Mindestlohn wird angehoben. Das hatte die Mindestlohn-Kommission im Juni beschlossen. Am 1. Januar 2026 sind 13,90 Euro pro Stunde verpflichtend. 8,42 Prozent mehr für Geringverdiener. Das Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB) hat diese Woche eine Studie dazu veröffentlicht. Ein Fazit: 13 Prozent der Neuanstelllungen sind betroffen. Einige Jobs lohnen sich jetzt mehr.\nMehr neue Mitarbeiter betroffen als bereits angestellte Kollegen\nLaut den Studienautoren entsteht ein besonderer Unterschied zu bereits bestehenden Arbeitsverhältnissen: Hier sind lediglich fünf Prozent der Beschäftigten für weniger als 13,90 pro Stunde beschäftigt.\nDie Land- und Forstwirtschaft kann sich besonders freuen: Hier werden 53,2 Prozent der neuen Mitarbeiter profitieren. Wobei hauptsächlich die Landwirtschaft gemeint sein dürfte – hier arbeiten viele Saisonarbeiter aus dem Ausland. In der Vergangenheit gab es Diskussionen darum, ob der neue Mindestlohn auch in der Landwirtschaft gelten sollte. Eine Ausnahme ist aber rechtlich nicht möglich, wie eine Prüfung des Bundesagrarministeriums ergeben hat.\nGewerkschafter findet Zahlung von Mindestlöhnen „skandalös“\nDas Gastgewerbe ist mit 35,3 Prozent bei allen Neueinstellungen betroffen. Das schließt etwa Hotels und Restaurants und Bars ein. Hier profitieren also besonders viele Menschen vom neuen Mindestlohn. Die zuständige Gewerkschaft NGG findet es jedoch „skandalös“, dass das Gastgewerbe nach wie vor eine „Mindestlohnbranche“ sei.\nMark Baumeister von der zuständigen Gewerkschaft NGG sagte: „Den Preis dafür zahlen wir alle: durch Aufstockung der nicht ausreichenden Einkommen jetzt und später bei der Rente.“ Das Gastgewerbe müsse aus dem Niedriglohnbereich raus. Er fordert vom Tarifpartner DEHOGA, dieser müsse „unbedingt“ die Klauseln abschaffen, die es Arbeitgebern ermöglichten, die Tarifverträge in einigen Bundesländern „zum Schaden der Beschäftigten zu unterlaufen“.\nDie Botschaft: Mehr Tariflöhne bedeuten weniger Abhängigkeit vom Mindestlohn. Zuletzt hatte das Bundeskabinett beschlossen, die Tarifbindung bei eigenen Aufträgen zu stärken. DEHOGA-Präsident Guido Zöllick sprach in Bezug auf den Mindestlohn von „massiven Auswirkungen der Erhöhung auf die Betriebe seiner Branche“. Für die Hotellerie und Gastronomie bedeuteten diese „deutlichen Personalkostensteigerungen“ große Herausforderungen, wie er dem Portal Tageskarte berichtete.\nAbgesehen vom Gastgewerbe hat das IAB auch die Zahlen mitgeliefert, wie viele Menschen in Jobs insgesamt betroffen sein werden: Die Mindestlohnerhöhung betrifft demnach 10 Prozent aller bestehenden und neu begonnenen Jobs. Stefan Körzell, Vorstandsmitglied beim Deutschen-Gewerkschafts-Bund (DGB), sagt dazu: „Die Zahlen zeigen, wie groß der Niedriglohnsektor in Deutschland nach wie vor ist. Hier muss mit aller Kraft gegengesteuert werden – für gute Löhne und gute Arbeitsbedingungen.“\nNeben einem steigenden Mindestlohn brauche es laut Körzell eine flächendeckende Tarifbindung – „Unternehmen dürfen sich nicht länger aus der Verantwortung stehlen und müssen Tarifverträge akzeptieren“, sagte er dieser Zeitung. Das neue Tariftreuegesetz der Bundesregierung sei ein erster guter Schritt. „Weitere müssen folgen.“\nMindestlohn soll erhöht werden – Minijobs werden attraktiver\nInsbesondere Minijobs werden attraktiver. Die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns auf 13,90 Euro „würde hochgerechnet etwa 39 Prozent der Minijobs betreffen“, schreiben die Autoren. Nicole Gürtzgen spricht von einem „spürbaren Einfluss“ auf die Entlohnung im Niedriglohnbereich. Sie ist Leiterin des Forschungsbereichs Arbeitsmarktprozesse und Institutionen am IAB. Aber: auch hier Kritik von der Gewerkschaft. Dass vor allem Menschen in Minijobs von Niedriglöhnen betroffen sind, zeige, dass „Minijobs strenger reguliert“ und in „sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung umgewandelt“ werden müssten, sagte Körzell vom DGB.\nÜbrigens: Einige Menschen profitieren weder vom alten noch vom neuen Mindestlohn. Jugendliche unter 18 Jahren ohne abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung sind vom Mindestlohn ausgenommen, genauso wie manche Praktikanten, Menschen mit Behinderungen, die in Werkstätten arbeiten sowie Langzeitarbeitslose in den ersten sechs Monaten, wenn sie einen neuen Job aufnehmen. Auch Insassen in Gefängnissen sind betroffen.",
