    "title": "Bruce Willis' daughter shares update on his dementia battle after devastating diagnosis",
    "text": "Bruce Willis' family has been left heartbroken after his health took a turn for the worse, following his aphasia diagnosis last year. The Hollywood star, known for his role in 'Die Hard', had to retire from acting in 2022 due to aphasia, the language disorder that affects communication skills.\nHis condition has since progressed to frontotemporal dementia, a more severe and specific form of the disease, causing immense distress for Bruce and his loved ones. Tallulah Willis, one of Bruce's five daughters, spoke to\nPeople about her father's condition, saying he is 'doing the same', but she often prepared to be 'open to what the visit is'.\n\"I'll go visit my dad and spend some time with him,\" she added. \"But whatever kind of day it is, my family and I meet him where he's at.\"\nFrontotemporal dementia, as described by the\nNHS, is a rare dementia type that primarily affects behaviour and language, usually diagnosed in individuals aged between 45 and 65, but can occur at any age.\nThere is currently no cure or way to slow down its progression. Neurologist Dr Nicholas Milano at\nMUSC Health Memory Disorders Clinic, previously explained: \"While everyone is different, the average life expectancy of a patient diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia is nine years from the first symptom but five years from the first diagnosis. Because usually there’s a delay in diagnosis.\n\"... Because it’s less common than Alzheimer's disease, there probably hasn’t been as much research, and there haven't been any treatments that have been shown to be beneficial.\"\nAlthough Bruce's condition has especially impaired his\nuse of language, Tallulah last year shared her gratitude that his physical mobility hadn't been affected. In a Vogue piece, she said: \"I keep flipping between the present and the past when I talk about Bruce: he is, he was, he is, he was.\n\"That’s because I have hopes for my father that I’m so reluctant to let go of. I’ve always recognized elements of his personality in me, and I just know that we’d be such good friends if only there were more time.\"\nWhat do you think? Let us know in the comment section below",

    "title": "Massachusetts Unveils Landmark Environmental Justice Strategy",
    "text": "In a landmark move, Massachusetts has become a beacon of hope for communities long marginalized in environmental policymaking. The Healey-Driscoll Administration, in a bold stride towards justice and equity, announced the state's inaugural Environmental Justice Strategy. This comprehensive framework, as revealed by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, pledges to weave the principles of equity and justice into the fabric of the state's environmental actions. On this day, February 15, 2024, we stand at the threshold of a new era where the environmental burdens of the past are acknowledged and the path forward promises inclusivity and fairness for all residents.\nA Blueprint for Change\nThe Environmental Justice Strategy is more than a document; it is a testament to Massachusetts' commitment to righting the wrongs that have disproportionately affected its low-income and minority communities. At its core, the strategy is built on pillars of community engagement, a balanced analysis of project impacts, and ensuring language accessibility. This holistic approach is designed not only to address current disparities but to lay a robust foundation for sustainable and equitable environmental stewardship. The administration has also committed to revising this living document every three years, with the first of its annual progress reports to be unveiled in December 2024. This iterative process, enriched by public input, signifies a steadfast commitment to transparency and adaptability.\nVoices from the Ground Up\nCentral to this strategy is the recognition of the critical role played by community engagement. Massachusetts is setting a precedent by not just listening but actively incorporating the voices of those who have been sidelined in environmental discussions. Initiatives to expand urban forests, strengthen ties with Indigenous peoples, and enhance access to grants for environmental justice communities are a testament to this new direction. Moreover, the strategy's emphasis on language access plans and staff training underscores a dedication to meaningful dialogue and understanding, ensuring no resident is left behind in these crucial conversations.\nThe Path Forward\nEndorsements from various stakeholders have flooded in, lauding the Healey-Driscoll Administration for its visionary approach. This strategy is seen as a crucial step towards ensuring an equitable energy transition, one that does not just promise, but delivers tangible results. The emphasis on tracking metrics and annual reporting will hold the administration accountable, providing a transparent look at progress and areas needing improvement. This not only fosters trust but also ensures that the strategy remains dynamic, evolving with the needs of the communities it serves.\nAs Massachusetts embarks on this journey towards environmental justice, the Healey-Driscoll Administration's Environmental Justice Strategy stands as a bold declaration that equity and justice are not mere buzzwords but actionable principles guiding the state's environmental policy. It is a comprehensive approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental health, social equity, and economic vitality. Through community engagement, thoughtful analysis, and a commitment to continuous improvement, Massachusetts is charting a course towards a future where every resident, regardless of their background, has a voice in shaping the environmental legacy of their state. The journey ahead is long, but the foundation laid today promises a brighter, more equitable tomorrow for all.",

    "title": "'Labor of love' motivates scrappy nordic ski club in North Cascades",
    "text": "SALMON RIDGE SNO-PARK, Whatcom County, Wash. — On any given winter day, hundreds of cars carrying their fattest powder skis and snowboards head up Highway 542. En route to the legendary deep powder at Mt. Baker Ski Area, they typically zoom past an evergreen-lined clearing 5 miles before their destination. Those who do pull over will find another ski scene, albeit one with much skinnier equipment.\nSalmon Ridge Sno-Park is the main trailhead to access some 14 miles of forest roads maintained by the Nooksack Nordic Ski Club for groomed skiing, plus many more miles of ungroomed backcountry trails. Founded in 1992 by a group of Whatcom County cross-country enthusiasts, the volunteer club has cultivated a small but mighty nordic community in an unforgiving setting that receives snow and rain in seemingly equal measure.\nKeeping this scrappy operation going, said former club president Gail Garman, \"is a labor of love.\"\nThe climate of the western slope of the North Cascades certainly tests that love. This close to sea level, the outcome of ferocious winter storms rolling in off the Pacific is extremely elevation-sensitive. Glacier, the nearest town nestled in the Nooksack River valley, gets some 65 inches of precipitation per year. Much of that liquid gold manifests as snow at Mt. Baker Ski Area (starting elevation 3,500 feet) — but whether it translates to the fluffy white stuff or drenching rain at Salmon Ridge (elevation 2,000 feet) is touch and go.\nBy comparison, the popular nordic trails at the Cabin Creek Sno-Park operated by the Kongsberger Ski Club start at 2,462 feet, but also benefit from their location east of the Cascade crest, where they capture more cold air from Eastern Washington.\nVariable snow is just one challenge facing the intrepid nordic skiers of Whatcom County. A network of creeks flushing the Nooksack watershed crisscross the trail system and a robust tree canopy overshadows trails where dense brush thrives on the wet side of the Cascades. Keeping running water and slide alder at bay takes dedicated maintenance.\nOn a calm, cold day with fresh snow, it's a picturesque setting, where you can ski along the Razor Hone trail through a veritable rainforest or cruise out from White Salmon to an overlook with a dramatic view of jagged, glacier-speckled Mount Shuksan.\nA windy rainstorm, however, can wreak havoc in its aftermath. Deadfall is a particularly thorny problem, and the club's latter-day lumberjacks head out with chain saws in tow to remove trees upward of 4 feet in diameter. In summer 2022, there were 36 mature fallen trees alone, some of which required hiring a heavy-equipment operator to clear.\n\"You have to be so in love with being outdoors in the winter that you will do all kinds of work to try to maintain the trails, get rid of the brush and keep the drainages clear,\" said Garman. \"Without that commitment, there would be no nordic area.\"\nThe volunteer labor provided by the club's 90-odd members ranges from providing muscle at year-round work parties, to serving as nordic ambassadors who orient visitors on busy weekends, to tackling the behind-the-scenes administrative work necessary for maintaining and improving trails. The Nooksack Nordic Ski Club operates on U.S. Forest Service land under a voluntary services agreement, while the Washington State Parks Sno-Park program funds contracted plowing and grooming.\nGrants from the National Recreation Trails program and the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office have also helped the shoestring operation, which provides the closest groomed nordic skiing to residents of Whatcom and Skagit counties.\nThis effort \"isn't just for a club of 90 people,\" Garman said, \"it is for the whole community.\"\nBut Garman, who moved to Whatcom County in 1997 and served six years on the state's Winter Recreation Advisory Committee, has seen the region's winter weather change — for the worse.\n\"Most years are so-so and a few are downright terrible,\" she said. \"A bunch of snow and then it rains.\" By her estimation, the last truly stellar Nooksack nordic ski season was in 2006.\nGarman's observation tracks with predictions from the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group that climate change will lead to warmer, wetter winters in the Cascades. Those conditions are unkind to the Nooksack nordic ski trails.\n\"Every time you think you're ready for winter, something else happens — road erosion, bridge wipes out, drainage plugged,\" Garman said. \"I keep feeling like Sisyphus.\"\nFor example, she noted that a washed-out bridge on Anderson Creek Road, which shortened one trail from 8 miles to 1.8 miles round trip, has gone unrepaired for nearly a decade.\nDespite some discouraging aspects, the Nooksack Nordic Ski Club soldiers on. Grooming is scheduled for twice weekly this winter. Current club president Pete Tryon gamely treks up from Bellingham and ventures out even in the worst conditions to send regular trip reports at\nnooksacknordicskiclub.org.\nWhy such dogged devotion to a climate and terrain seemingly so inhospitable to nordic skiing? Garman's explanation is straightforward: \"We live here and it's all we have.\"\n(c)2023 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at\nwww.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by\nTribune Content Agency, LLC.",
