    "title": "Sudan is starving and ignored",
    "text": "While the eyes of the world is focused on the Israeli genocide on Gaza, Sudan is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as widespread hunger and malnutrition plague the nation. The Sudan starvation crisis emerged as a direct consequence of armed conflict. There is a need for immediate international intervention to stop the starvation of millions in Sudan. There are more than nine million people across 18 states of Sudan that are facing food shortages that have caused malnutrition and death. More than 800,000 of those are at risk of immediate starvation. According to an analysis by Save the Children, some 16.4 million children, or three in every four in the country, are now facing 'crisis', 'emergency' or 'catastrophe' levels of hunger - up from 8.3 million just last December. The United Nations reported that there are more than 10 million people who have been displaced in Sudan since the conflict began in April 2023 and nearly 25 million people are in need of aid, according to the UN. Escalating Conflict and Displacement The Sudanese conflict started in April 2023 between the Sudanese army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by his former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Sudan's army suggested to the RSF to unite and form one national army, but General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo \"Hemedti\" refused and started attacking Sudan's army. Sudan has been bearing the brunt of political instability for decades. Internal conflicts, fueled by ethnic tensions, political power struggles, and resource disparities, have created an environment of violence and insecurity. By 2024, these factors reached a boiling point, resulting in widespread displacement of communities, disruption of agricultural activities, and destruction of vital infrastructure. As a consequence, access to food, clean water, and healthcare services significantly diminished, pushing the nation further down a path of starvation. The two sides of the conflict of Sudan General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as \"Hemedti\", is the leader of RSF. He came to prominence as the deputy leader of a transitional council launched after former strongman Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019. Dagalo was born around 1974 into the Mahariya tribe of the Rizeigat community in Darfur, the nephew of a tribal chief in the camel-trading branch of the Rizeigat. According to human rights groups have accused the Janjaweed of war crimes - including killings, rapes and torture of civilians - throughout the conflict in Darfur. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said doctors and nurses have been killed and wounded, and many health facilities have been damaged by shelling and airstrikes since the conflict broke out in mid-April last year. The first appearance of the RSF was in 2013 under Dagalo's leadership. It combined elements of the Janjaweed into a new force under the auspices of al-Bashir and his National Intelligence and Security Services. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan is known to be a powerful military commander who has for years been a de facto leader of the African nation. Little known before 2019, General al-Burhan rose to power in the tumultuous aftermath of the military-led coup that ousted Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the authoritarian leader who was deposed after popular uprisings in 2019. Economic Instability and Food Inflation The Sudanese economy has been marred by mismanagement, corruption, and the effects of economic sanctions, resulting in skyrocketing inflation and a depreciating currency. High food prices have pushed a significant portion of the population into extreme poverty, making it even harder for them to secure adequate nutrition. Basic commodities, including grains and meat, have become unaffordable for the majority of the Sudanese people, pushing them further into the grip of starvation. According to Sudanese economical experts, the Sudanese pound continues to collapse against foreign currencies, exacerbating the financial strain on millions of Sudanese who have lost most of their income due to the ongoing conflict. The Sudanese national bank \"Bank of Khartoum\" offered to buy dollars at 1,860 pounds and sell them at 1,873 pounds while offering the Saudi riyal for purchase at 501.49 pounds and selling it at 505.25 pounds.

    "text": "KOTA BHARU, May 26 (Bernama) -- The Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) will refer to the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) over the action of two women who were captured in a video stepping over a grave at a Muslim cemetery yesterday. Its deputy minister, Dr Zulkifli Hasan, said the matter needed to be referred to the religious body because it involves Islamic law and also to resolve the misunderstanding among the public. “If the public refers to religious authorities before taking any action involving religious sensitivity, the department will immediately give advice and guide them to avoid undesirable incidents. “Content creators are also reminded to uphold religious harmony to ensure that the content uploaded on social media platforms are based on authentic sources and practises allowed by Islam,” he told reporters after the dialogue session with Kelantan’s federal public servants at the Rural Transformation Centre (RTC) of the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA), here today. A 37-second video went viral on social media yesterday, showing the action of the two women, sparking anger among netizens who deemed their behaviour outrageous and disrespectful. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.

    "text": "«Аномалия»: Вирусолог предупредила об искусственно созданном штамме коронавируса\nВирусолог Протасова: Современные штаммы омикрона могли быть созданы искусственно\nОбложка © Шедеврум / Life.ru\nСовременные штаммы «омикрона» могут иметь искусственное происхождение и внедряться в геном человека, предупредила вирусолог Светлана Протасова. По её словам, данные выводы подтверждаются результатами исследования, опубликованного в июле 2025 года в рецензируемом научном журнале JMA. В частности, там «омикрон BA.2.86» или «пирола» сравнивается со скачком в эволюции коронавируса.\nЭксперты выяснили, что заразность этого штамма была недостаточной для доминирования, и только после мутации в вариант JN.1 «пирола» стал более заразным, что привело к всплеску инфекций. Однако данный вирус значительно отличается генетически от других вариантов «омикрона», что и привлекло внимание учёных. Подтип JN.1 практически полностью вытеснил другие линии вируса.\nДоктор медицинских наук отметила, что, несмотря на мутации РНК-вирусов, скорость мутаций вируса SARS-CoV-2 остаётся относительно низкой, примерно в 23,9 раза меньше, чем у вируса гриппа А, что делает появление вариантов BA.1 и BA.2.86 особенно заметным.\n«При изучении происхождения Пиролы BA.2.86 обнаружена ещё одна аномалия: его первые случаи летом 2023 года были зафиксированы сразу в разных, географически удалённых точках мира», — обратил внимание собеседница RuNews24.ru.\nТак, впервые он был обнаружен в Дании 24 июля 2023 года и быстро распространился в Израиле, Южной Африке, Великобритании, США и ещё в 21 стране. Было зарегистрировано не менее 202 случаев этого варианта. Исследователи считают маловероятным для вируса естественного происхождения такое быстрое мутационное разнообразие и широкое распространение за короткий срок.\nРанее учёные выяснили, что огромное число людей погибли в пандемию вовсе не от ковида. Тем временем названы сроки новой волны коронавируса в России. Кстати, украинцев начал терзать «хриплый» штамм коронавируса.",

    "text": "New Delhi [India], February 29 (ANI): The Ministry of Women and Child Development organised the Poshan Utsav at The Oberoi on February 29, 2024. The event was aimed at promoting good nutrition behaviour and highlighted India's ongoing efforts to combat malnutrition by promoting good nutrition practices.\nThe event was graced by the Union Minister for Women and Child Development and Minority Affairs Smriti Zubin Irani and Bill Gates Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).\nThe event featured the release of &apos;Poshan Utsav Book&apos; and announced the launch of the Cartoon Coalition. The &apos;Poshan Utsav Book&apos;, conceptualised by the Ministry of Women and Child Development has been curated by the Deendayal Research Institute (DRI). The book seeks to revive ancient nutrition traditions, facilitating knowledge exchange and intergenerational learning. It also serves as a comprehensive repository for appreciation of the rich culinary heritage and nutritional diversity of the country.\nThe Cartoon Coalition is envisaged to support and contribute towards the cause of Poshan through collaboration with MWCD. This Coalition is born out of a collaboration between renowned cartoon entities in India to harness the power of popular cartoon characters to convey essential messages on nutrition in an entertaining and relatable manner for positive behaviour change among children.Addressing the gathering, Gates said, \"The Poshan Utsav book is a great example of incorporating local context and cultural practices to promote nutritional foods across India&apos;s diverse communities.\"\n\"When you improve the life of a woman, there&apos;s a ripple effect: You improve her community and her country. In India, we&apos;ve seen that this kind of progress can be lasting and can be achieved on a massive scale,\" the billionaire philanthropist added.In her keynote address, Irani, while expressing appreciation for the efforts made by BMGF in the nutrition and gender space, said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the &apos;Poshan Abhiyaan&apos; in 2018, it marked a historic moment for the country.\n\"For the first time, 18 ministries of the Government of India came together under the national flagship programme called Poshan Abhiyaan,\" she said.She emphasised that every Anganwadi centre has been digitally enabled so that service delivery to the last mile can be tracked. She also stated that handheld devices are now available to Anganwadi centres across the country. Every month, Anganwadi Didis measure 75 million children under the age of 6 years as per WHO standards, she added.\nShe stated further that after the operationalisation of Poshan Tracker, the numbers for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) children have shown a significant decline as compared to the data reported under the NFHS-5 survey. She highlighted that the cartoon coalition launched was aimed as a significant step towards bringing about behavioural change in children for a healthy lifestyle.The presence of popular cartoon characters like Chacha Chaudhary, Suppandi, Shambhu, and Elmo added another dimension to the occasion. The programme was a milestone event in the effort to combat malnutrition and foster healthier lifestyles among children. It was a significant step towards the goal of &apos;Suposhit Bharat&apos;.

    "text": "Overview of a Rising Talent\nWill Campbell has established himself as a standout left tackle prospect with a unique blend of size, athleticism, and refined technique. With his remarkable frame measuring 6-foot-6 and weighing 325 pounds, he presents an imposing figure on the field. His development as a dominant presence on the offensive line has made him a highly anticipated figure, especially for teams seeking to solidify their pass protection schemes.\nBackground and Physical Attributes\nHailing from Monroe, Louisiana, Campbell was nearly recognized as a five-star prospect coming out of high school. Now a key player at LSU, he has met and exceeded the lofty expectations set for him. His physical stature enables him to effectively counter power rushes, while his agility and balance set him apart as a lineman who can maneuver with finesse. His ability to anchor his stance has made him an invaluable asset in both run blocking and pass protection.\nTechnical Skills and On-Field Impact\nCampbell’s proficiency is underscored by his advanced technical skills on the field. He consistently demonstrates excellent leverage and coordination that allow him to execute precise hand placement and maintain stability against formidable pass rushers. His robust hands enable him to engage opponents aggressively, often neutralizing threats with well-timed strikes and blocks. Although he occasionally faces challenges with consistency in the ground game, his performance in pass protection remains a key strength that teams will rely on.\nVersatility and Positional Value\nWhile his primary projection is at left tackle, Campbell’s experience at right tackle and his potential adaptability to guard further enhance his value. His ability to transition between positions underscores the depth of his skill set, making him a versatile option who can adjust to varying offensive line needs. This adaptability positions him as a cornerstone in safeguarding a quarterback’s blind side and reinforcing the overall offensive structure.\nImplications for the NFL Draft and Team Strategy\nChampioned as a must-have talent for teams looking to protect their future quarterback assets, Campbell’s profile has ignited interest as a top selection in the upcoming NFL Draft. His blend of size, strength, and agility not only makes him ideally suited to withstand powerful defenders but also ensures that he can maintain his balance and limit penalties during demanding plays. Teams eyeing to bolster their offensive line will find his combination of raw power and technique a compelling factor in their draft strategies.\nWill Campbell’s continued development promises to translate into significant contributions at the professional level, offering teams an immediate and substantial upgrade to their offensive front. His journey from a high-potential recruit to a demonstrably impactful player epitomizes the kind of talent that can redefine an offensive line’s dynamic.",

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sport Australia Aussie swimming coach Michael Palfrey learns fate over 'un-Australian' comments at Olympics There were calls for the Australian coach to be sent home from the Paris Olympics. andrew reid · sam goodwin Thu, 25 July 2024, 11:40 pm · 5-min read Link copied\nAustralian swimming coach Michael Palfrey has been allowed to stay at the Paris Olympics and won't be sent home, despite backlash over his 'un-Australian' comments about a South Korean swimmer. Palfrey has been caught in a storm after expressing his support for 400m freestyle world champion Kim Woo-min, despite being a coach on the Aussie team.\nPalfrey is employed by Swimming Australia but the Dolphins coach is also close with a number of Korean swim stars that he previously worked with. Kim is set to race against Australian duo Sam Short and Elijah Winnington in the men’s 400m freestyle on Sunday morning (AEST), and Palfrey's allegiance has been called into question after comments he made about Kim on Korean TV.\nMichael Palfrey (L) expressed his support for South Korean swimmer Kim Woo-min (R). Image: Channel 9/Getty\nPalfrey reportedly finished up a training session with the Aussies earlier this week, after which time he conducted a poolside interview to talk up the prospects of the Korean superstar Kim. It's understood Palfrey told Korean TV that he \"really hopes\" Kim can win the 400m freestyle, despite the fact he'll be going up against the two Aussies.\nAustralia's swimming coaches were reportedly told in March to cut ties with any non-Australian athletes under their wings. It's understood the Dolphins coach also signed off on the interview by exclaiming \"go Korea\", sparking major backlash ahead of the Paris Games.\n“I really hope he can win, but ultimately I really hope he swims well,” Palfrey reportedly told Korean media in Paris. “It’s been a very collaborative approach from the coaches in Korea and myself in Australia. I’m very good friends with the Australian coaches and swimmers but I have really enjoyed coaching Kim as well.”\nMichael Palfrey sparked backlash over his comments. Image: Twitter Michael Palfrey allowed to remain at Paris Olympics\nThe interview led to calls for the Australian Olympic Team to send Palfrey home from Paris. But on Friday, Aussie chef de mission Anna Meares reported that head swimming coach Rohan Taylor has allowed him to stay.\n\"I support Rohan Taylor and his team and the decision they have taken in the interests of the swimming team. It is a decision based on high-performance and wellbeing,\" Meares said. Taylor said: \"We took the time to consider the two options – for Mick Palfrey to stay - and for Michael Palfrey to be sent home. After extended conversations, with athletes, the athlete leadership group, and coaching staff we have made the decision for Michael to stay. It is not one we have taken lightly and I stress this is an ongoing discussion for when we return home.\"\nTwo of Kim's biggest rivals for the 400m freestyle gold are Aussies Short and Winnington, with the former crowned world champion in 2023 and the latter finishing runner-up to the Korean in the same event earlier this year. “I really think that last 100 to 200 metres is going to be a bit of a dogfight. It’s going to rough. The boys are going to be there,” Palfrey said. “There will be three or four of them in the race that think they can win it. I think it’s going to come down to that last 100 metres. We need Woo-min to lift, that’s what I’ll be saying to him. He’s got to race tough.”\nRELATED:\nMackenzie Arnold in bombshell reveal about Matildas before Olympics\nFresh fallout in Olympics scandal as horse whipping video emerges\nMatildas' rivals caught in 'spying' scandal at Olympics after complaint\nAOC says Michael Palfrey comments are 'deeply concerning' Palfrey is one of eight coaches that make up the Dolphins team in Paris., The Australian Olympic Committee had earlier described his comments as \"deeply concerning\" and showing \"a serious error of judgement\".\n\"The AOC has been made aware of coach Mick Palfrey's comments,\" an AOC spokesperson told The Sydney Morning Herald . \"The remarks are deeply concerning and represent a serious error of judgement. The AOC is working with Swimming Australia to gain further information before making any decisions. This includes meeting with the coach and affected athletes.\"\nPalfrey looks after Aussie swimmers Zac Incerti, Abbey Connor and Alex Perkins but has also worked with several Korean swimmers such as Kim, Lee Yoo-yeon, Yang Jae-hoon, Lee Ho-joon and Hwang Sun-woo, who all travelled to Australia to train with the coach in Queensland. The Aussie coach admitted he's relishing the battle between Kim, Short and Winnington in the 400m freestyle in Paris.\nAustralian swimmer Elijah Winnington and Korea's Kim Woo-min are among the favourites for 400m freestyle gold at the Paris Olympic Games. Pic: Getty\nWinnington (3:43.26) pipped Short (3:43.90) to victory in a thrilling 400m freestyle race at the Australian Olympics trials last month. And the pair will go up against Kim in Paris looking to claim gold in an event won six times by Australian men, with Murray Rose (1956, 1960) and Ian Thorpe (2000 and 2004) both winning back-to-back Olympic golds and Brad Cooper(1972) and Mack Horton (2016) claiming one each.\n“I want to see new ground always being broken, I want to see world records being broken,” Palfrey said about the 400m freestyle showdown. “With Woo-min, what I can see that he can do in the training pool, not many swimmers can do.\n“I’m excited to work with an athlete and that I am going, ‘Wow, this guy is something special’. We just need to give him enough time that he keeps on improve him... We want to see him swim a best time. If he swims a best time, he’ll be amongst it.\n\"He’ll be in the top few swimmers in the race. I think Woo-Min can definitely be amongst the medals but the hard thing for him is that those (Australian) guys have already posted fast times. He’s got to find another level. Hopefully at this meet, he can go faster.”",
