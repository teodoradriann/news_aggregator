    "title": "Bitcoin ETF Ban: South Korean Authorities Crack Down On Spot And Futures",
    "text": "The Financial Supervisory Service of South Korea (FSS) has once again reaffirmed its [prohibition on Bitcoin](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2024112037775) spot as well as futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) which has drawn criticism from industry participants and legal practitioners.\nThis is part of overhauling regulations that have more or less kept the cryptocurrency market stunted particularly South Korea’s as compared to other advanced markets. The lack of FSS endorsement for such investment vehicles has major consequences to the financial scene of the country.\nRegulatory Stance On Bitcoin Remains Firm\nThe FSS’s recent declaration demonstrates its continued commitment to stringent regulations governing [cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/) investments. Despite increasing global adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, South Korea remains hostile. The FSS has not only prohibited the development of Bitcoin spot and futures ETFs, but it has also restricted funds related to prominent cryptocurrency firms such as Coinbase.\nThis decision is based on measures implemented in 2017 to reduce the financial risks connected with virtual assets. However, detractors say that these regulations are out of date and lack legal basis in the contemporary situation.\nAn official at an asset management firm voiced frustration, noting: “We were ready to launch an ETF investing in Coinbase, but the FSS said we can’t for now.”\nThis opinion reflects a broader concern among financial organizations that South Korea is passing up lucrative investment prospects as other countries embrace cryptocurrency-related products.\nLegal Concerns And Criticism\nLegal experts have opined that the actions taken by the FSS are beyond its purview under the Capital Markets Act. According to Jeong Su-ho, an attorney with Renaissance Law Firm, excluding investments in public enterprises like Coinbase into a slate for prohibition has a strong legal basis.\nHe argues that while the FSS claims to protect investors, its method might be a case of regulatory overreach instead of actual investor safety.\nIn the banking industry of South Korea, this regulatory structure has discouraged creativity. In the lack of clear guidelines and support, many asset managers are wary to search for fresh digital currency products fearing rejection by the FSS.\nGlobal Context And Future Implications\nOther markets are growing while South Korea’s rules get stricter. Investors are getting more opportunities in places like the US by offering more[ Bitcoin ETFs](https://etfdb.com/themes/bitcoin-etfs/) and other similar financial instruments. Nasdaq’s recent start of trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF shows that cryptocurrencies are becoming more accepted in the financial world.\nIn South Korea, financial authorities have banned\n[#Bitcoin]spot and futures ETFs.They also recently rejected the launch of funds investing in Bitcoin-related companies like Coinbase, citing investor protection as the reason.\nThanks for protecting us!\n[@fsckorea]— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju)\n[November 20, 2024]\nKi Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, says that these rules are meant to protect investors. However, people who disagree with them say that they are too strict and keep the country from following global trends in how digital assets are regulated.\nThe disparity between South Korea’s restrictive rules and the openness of other markets raises questions about the country’s global financial competitiveness. As demand for Bitcoin rises, industry stakeholders are concerned that South Korea’s inflexible approach would result in wasted chances for growth and innovation.\nAs the FSS maintains its ban on Bitcoin spot and futures ETFs, the need for more flexible regulations grows. As global markets adapt, South Korea must reevaluate its strategy to avoid falling behind in the fast-changing world of cryptocurrency investing.\nFeatured image from CNBC, chart from TradingView",

    "text": "Nadine Spencer has been removed from the Toronto Police Service Board.\nCity council passed an urgent motion from Coun. Shelley Carroll (Ward 17), without debate, on Thursday to rescind Spencer's appointment to the board of the largest municipal police service in the country.\nIn a statement to CBC Thursday evening, Spencer said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by council's decision, and called the move \"reckless\".\nSpencer said the decision \"follows months of unfounded and false allegations.\"\nCBC Toronto asked Mayor Olivia Chow on Friday why council removed Spencer from the police board, but she said those details will not be made public.\n\"I think city council wants to bring in a person that is, that would be, able to serve the community,\" said Chow at a news conference.\n\"As to the details of what Nadine Spencer was accused of doing, I think we'll leave that and not comment on that, because it's really confidential — in terms of what she did and didn't do,\" Chow said.\nCouncil decision likely unprecedented Former Toronto police board chair Alok Mukherjee told CBC he believes the move by city council is unprecedented.\n\"I cannot recall a situation where the city council has ended the term of its appointee before the completion,\" said Mukherjee, who served as chair from 2005 to 2015.\nJohn Sewell, a former Toronto mayor and co-ordinator of the Toronto Police Accountability Coalition, said that to his knowledge, a police board member has never been removed by Toronto City Council before Thursday.\nEarlier this month, a CBC Toronto investigation discovered three seemingly fabricated, or misrepresented, employees on the websites of marketing companies owned by Spencer. All signs of the three employees vanished from the websites after CBC Toronto asked Spencer about them.\nAt that time, in a series of email statements provided through her lawyer, Spencer \"categorically\" denied that her employees were fabricated.\nWATCH | Investigating BrandEQ's leadership: Toronto Police board member faces questions about identities of some of her employees\n23 days ago Duration 5:11 For years, Nadine Spencer's company BrandEQ has listed employees who appear to be fabricated, or at least misrepresented. CBC's findings on Spencer's company, BrandEQ, came after some members of the Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) raised concerns about how BrandEQ received more than $1.1 million in contracted work from the charity over the course of the six years Spencer was either president of BBPA's board of directors, or its CEO.\nIn a written statement to CBC Toronto at the time, Spencer said she's proud of the work she did at the BBPA to lift up others in her community, and \"any suggestion I did so to benefit myself is false, and frankly, absurd.\"\nSpencer was appointed to the Toronto Police Service Board by city council in spring 2023. Until her removal, she was one of seven board members in charge of overseeing the budget and operation of the service.\nThe police board declined to comment on Spencer's removal.\nAll police service board members in Ontario are subject to a provincial code of conduct which states members \"shall not conduct themselves in a manner that undermines or is likely to undermine the public's trust in the police service board or the police service.\"\nCBC Investigates Who are these people? They supposedly worked for a Toronto police board member's companies CBC Investigates Prominent charity serving Black business community paid $1.5M to 2 board members' companies, records show \"I think the allegations that were made against this Member were quite serious,\" said Mukherjee on Thursday.\n\"Every police service board member is bound by the code of conduct and they have to be very, very careful in how they conduct themselves.\"\nIn her statement to CBC following Thursday's vote, Spencer said she had been in \"continuous\" contact with both the city and the board, which \"each recognized the importance of awaiting the third-party review\" into the allegations, which she called \"baseless.\"\nIn the same motion, city council appointed Chris Brillinger to take Spencer's place on the police board for a term ending in November 2026. Brillinger is currently the executive director of Family Services Toronto, which assists individuals and families facing mental health and socioeconomic challenges.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "A 4-year-old boy was rescued after surviving nearly 24 hours alone in California woods\nBy Dalia Faheid, CNN\n(CNN) — A 4-year-old boy who went missing at a lake in Fresno County, California, on Thursday has been found safe after surviving nearly 24 hours alone in the woods, the sheriff’s office said.\nMembers of the Tulare County Search and Rescue Team found Christian Ramirez around 8 a.m. on Friday about a quarter mile away from where he reportedly disappeared the day before. Rescuers found Christian under a tree, according to\nCNN affiliate KFSN.\n“We’re fortunate this morning that as these searchers were calling out for the boy, he called back,” Fresno County Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Pursell told KFSN.\nChristian was tired and hungry but in good condition, the sheriff’s office said. He has been reunited with his parents.\n“There’s a lot of things that could have gone really, really wrong with this one, and we got lucky, the family got lucky. The boy is very, very fortunate to be with his family,” Pursell told CNN affiliate KABC.\nThe child was found in a wooded area, Pursell told\nKABC, and “it was pretty clear that he had been lost and he had kind of hunkered down for the entire night.” The three-foot-tall, 40-pound boy braved the woods at night in a t-shirt and shorts, according to KFSN.\n“Huntington is known to have bears. There’s possibilities of big cats up there also. We also have snakes. There’s lots of little dangers up there. Slip-and-fall hazards and waterways,” Pursell said.\nThe family reported their son was missing from their campsite at the Rancheria Campground in Huntington Lake around 11 a.m. Thursday.\n“In a matter of less than five minutes, he just disappeared,” Pursell said.\nThat’s when the Search and Rescue team, Air Support Unit, Forest Service rangers and California Department of Fish and Wildlife officers went searching for him in the northeastern area of Huntington Lake.\nDogs, helicopters and nearly 70 rescuers searched for Christian through the night, according to KFSN.\n“This was an amazing show of teamwork and dedication. There were more than 50 deputies and volunteers who combined to participate in this search,” the sheriff’s office said. “This included members of other law enforcement agencies who assisted us, working non-stop throughout the night.”\nThe sheriff’s office said the community’s efforts also helped them rescue Christian and bring him home.\n“Many people offered to help join the search, kept their eyes peeled, spread the word on social media and sent prayers up. All of this undoubtedly helped to bring Christian home safely,” the office said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

The group says they will continue their attacks until Israel stops its attack on Hamas.",

    "text": "Bad news, people. While some of us whine about what seems like innumerable levels of government in this country, apparently we are a minority. Apparently the rest of us love it. The rest of us can blame the British says AJ Brown, professor of public policy and law at Griffith University and the full bottle on how we feel about our constitution. Yes, it's the Brits' fault we have three levels of government - first the states, then the federation - and as a weak afterthought, local government. \"We were probably the first colonised country in the world, maybe the first country in the world, to actually have a federal system whose genesis was actually to be a system with at least two levels and and probably three levels.\" But if we were to sit down today and redesign it, what would that look like? My secret fantasy has always been to get rid of state governments and just have a federal government with beefed-up local governments. Hold your horses right there, says Brown. His research shows over 16 years that while there was once a belief the feds would just step up and sort everything, \"It is now less clear citizens have any level of government in which to place solid confidence.\" Brown says the idea what we are over-governed is a myth. Local government is still weak in this country in comparison to most of the countries with which we compare ourselves to, in contrast to say the United States or Canada. Here, says Brown, local government is just underpowered and underfunded and has a much less significant role in the lives of communities and in economic development and in social services than in many, many other countries. \"The reality is that we are not over-governed. We're actually under-governed at a local and regional level, typically in most parts of Australia, by comparison to most countries, really, other than highly centralised, small European countries. The states have a truck load of constitutional power but they struggle with resourcing because it's the federal government that has almost complete control over raising taxes and collecting money. \"These are the really big imbalances in the system, and that's really the cause of most of our problems. It leads to confusion or overlap or duplication and [systems] not working well, \" says Brown. Yep. And we all wonder whether there's anyone actually looking after a problem properly. Cough, education. Cough, health. Looking at you two right there. There's been little change to our federal system since federation - and it's pretty unlikely we will get much anyhow. You can see we are terrified of change. READ MORE: Mark Chou, an expert in local government and an associate professor in the Department of Policy and Governance at ANU's Crawford School, says Australia's a bit of a frozen continent. We might think we want change but we aren't doing anything about it. \"What we have we'll likely to continue to have for the foreseeable future,\" says Chou. Occasionally we will take a bold step - or a politician will. When we needed to have that bold step - national concerted co-ordination - during the pandemic, a bunch of people you would never have thought could get on with each other, did just that. A Coalition prime minister. A bunch of bolshy premiers and chief ministers. The [national cabinet](https://newsnow.io/story/6721545/) showed us just what was possible. As Chou puts it: \"The national cabinet became a necessity to co-ordinate federal with state with local actions in an efficient and speedy manner.\" And it did. Which is not to say we could really do away with local government. Sure, says Chou, state governments could arguably carry out much of what local governments do now. But if they did, we would have decisions not made based on what locals need. And communities need local decisions. Chou says those local decisions encourage locals to participate. And remote decision-making would almost certainly ensure rural and regional Australia gets forgotten. Again. Sure state and territory representatives of those areas do their best but as Chou says, \"local councils, in practice, are often the only tier of government there on the ground - ensuring the services people need are met in a timely fashion.\" Like Brown's research, Chou's work also shows that Australians want [their local governments to do more](https://policybrief.anu.edu.au/beyond-roads-rates-and-rubbish-australians-want-their-closest-level-of-government-engaging-in-the-big-issues/): tackle big issues like climate change and Indigenous reconciliation at the local level. When state and federal governments seems unwilling to act, local authorities should step up. \"Instead of fewer tiers of governments, the push should be to better recognise and fund lower tiers of government, says Chou. So it's really hard to know the answer for what would be the best system if we were to sit down and redesign it better today. Want to get rid of the states? Brown warns we must be careful what we wish for. He backs up Chou's view that the further removed government is from its citizens, the less likely it is to really get what citizens want and need. And here's the real surprise. Remember I said Brown has been researching this area for nearly two decades. Well, it turns out that what we really want is four levels of government. Federal. State. Regional. Local. Yep, what we want is four tiers. I'm exhausted by the thought of it. We don't want to throw away anything we have got now. We want the states to stand up for us against the federal government and then we want governments to stand up for our regions, for our localities, for our suburbs. Our big cities crave more structure and so do those big complex regions - Gippsland, central Queensland. \"The interesting thing about that is that it reinforces that these structures do matter to people. People do see sometimes really clearly what's not working in the system, and they do think about it. And the interesting challenge is that is then how to count all that thinking is to try to make the system work better.\" And that is a challenge for all of us.

    "text": "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo established The International Center for the Care and Conservation of Giraffe (The Giraffe Center) in 2022. With three full-time employees, The Giraffe Center is a concentrated effort by CMZoo to consolidate resources, expand educational programs to improve and enrich the lives of giraffe in human care throughout the world, and inspire conservation action.\nIn January 2025, experts from around the world gathered at The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens, in Palm Springs, California, for The Giraffe Center’s Giraffe and Okapi Conference. More than 100 specialists, keepers, conservationists and researchers from 11 countries attended the four-day conference to share their experiences and expertise in giraffe and okapi care.\n“It was truly inspiring and fulfilling to see professionals from all aspects of giraffe and okapi care come together to share and learn from each other,” Amy Schilz, senior animal behaviorist at The Giraffe Center, says.\nThe momentum of giraffe and okapi care conferences had slowed in recent years, and The Giraffe Center team saw an opportunity to revive the exchange of ideas among giraffe and okapi professionals. Attendees, speakers and presenters gathered from around the world, including the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Belgium, England, Namibia, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Australia and the Netherlands.\nThis rich diversity meant attendees had access to a range of topics on improving the lives of giraffe and okapis in human care. They explored wild giraffe eating habits, and nutritionists discussed how different food types affect physiology. Experts shared insights for incorporating more browse into giraffe diets, and then led an open panel where attendees could pose questions on any aspect of giraffe and okapi care. Another panel focused on creating a full lifestyle of positive reinforcement for giraffe in human care, as opposed to creating sporadic enrichment opportunities.\nOne of the highlights of the conference was ‘Browse Day,’ when breakout groups discussed securing browse (natural tree branches and leaves), improving enrichment and feeding tactics, growing browse farms and identifying toxic plants. Jason Bredahl, CMZoo’s curator of environmental enhancements, presented at Browse Day.\n“I keep telling people, ‘browse is the way,” Jason says. “As animal care professionals, we always want to improve the lives of our animals. CMZoo has dedicated full-time employees, including me, to study how to do that, and this conference allows us to share the methods and data with others who can improve their animals’ lives.”\nThe data shows, basically, that for CMZoo’s giraffe herd, nothing beats browse. Jason describes the herd seeing browse like a dog when its owner comes home from work. They drop whatever they’re doing and beeline for the browse, even excitedly taking it out of staff members’ hands before they can hang it for them. Khalid, CMZoo’s breeding bull, enjoys stripping bark and leaves from branches so much that staff jokes that he’s just leaving ‘browse bones.’\nBrowse is more than fun for giraffe; it’s mentally and physically stimulating for the herd – and nutritious. To enjoy this giraffe-approved meal, they must travel to multiple browse locations and then spend time working to strip leaves and branches. Animals want to work for rewards, and eating browse is much more difficult and enriching for an animal, compared to scooping hay from a feeder. At the conference, attendees got insights that CMZoo’s environmental enhancements team has worked for years to study. They returned to their home herds with a head start, guidance on how to make it work at their own facilities and a support system.\nAttendees also gained valuable insight into okapi care and conservation, hearing firsthand from conservationists who work directly with okapis in the wild.\n“I remember walking by a group at the end of the night, and hearing one of the okapi conservationists tell stories of his field experiences to the okapi caretakers,” Amy says. “That was the moment for me. It reinforced how important it is for us to all meet, share and do this work with each other’s support.”\nThe conference fostered important senses of camaraderie and support among attendees.\n“My favorite thing was watching a room full of people who barely knew each other become friends,” Amy says. “Now, if they have a challenge, they have a support system to reach out to. That kind of professional network is invaluable, especially for those who are newer to the field. Shared knowledge ultimately improves care for okapi and giraffe all over the world – and that’s what we all want.”\nLooking ahead, The Giraffe Center will co-host a specialized workshop at West Midlands Safari Park in England in July. This hands-on event will focus on giraffe behavior and training, continuing the commitment to advancing best practices in giraffe care.\nFor more information on professional memberships, workshops and more, available for giraffe and okapi care teams, visit giraffecenter.cmzoo.org\nBack to The Waterhole",
