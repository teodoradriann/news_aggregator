(HANDOUT/GROOTE EYLANDT & BICKERTON ISLAND ENTERPRISES)\n“Our equipment in these remote locations are primarily powered by solar panels and the poor weather is limiting their ability to recharge the batteries,” he said.\nIt is unclear when the stations will be brought back online but the company promised to get crews into the area as soon as possible.\n“With roads closed, access to the area is by helicopter only at the moment and they are currently in high demand,” Mr Dancs said.\n“The high water levels in the area will also pose challenges for our crews to safely land in near proximity to our sites.”\nHe said about 400 fixed line services were also offline at Bing Bong, Mallapunya and Borroloola.\nEx-Tropical Cyclone Megan formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria and has since moved west to the territory’s border with WA, bringing strong thunderstorms to the Kimberley region.\nBorroloola residents are evacuated to Darwin after widespread flooding after Cyclone Megan. (HANDOUT/AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE)\nMore than 100 people from Borroloola were evacuated to Darwin on Wednesday, with more flights expected on Thursday.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology believes major flooding had occurred at the McArthur River, but said no recent river level observations were available as of Friday morning.\nMeanwhile, Tropical Cyclone Neville remains off the WA coast but is not expected to affect the mainland. It is moving westward and is expected to peter out.",

    "text": "El Gobierno de Colombia tiene como meta reducir en un 51% sus emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero al 2030, para lo cual presentó este miércoles en Barranquilla un portafolio para la transición climática.\n(Vea: ¿Por qué el Everest crece 2 milímetros al año? Esta es la razón ).\n\" Este portafolio tiene como objetivo orientar a Colombia hacia una economía baja en carbono, resiliente y biodiversa, que esté alineada con los compromisos internacionales del país, que haga realidad esas contribuciones determinadas a nivel nacional de reducir en un 51 % nuestros gases de efecto invernadero al 2030 \", expresó la ministra de Ambiente, Susana Muhamad. La funcionaria intervino en la instalación de la 'Feria de economías para la vida', en la que señaló que el portafolio es \" una estrategia económica que tiene un principio de planificación del Estado \", pero que \" solo será exitosa si logra articular y movilizar a todo el Gobierno, a toda la sociedad \".\n\" Vamos a dejar andando programas y proyectos para demostrar que esta transición es posible. Son 750.000 hectáreas que queremos dejar en restauración ecológica, bajo un nuevo modelo. Esta transición no son cosas separadas, es todo un ecosistema de transformación integral \", puntualizó Muhamad.\nPara conseguirlo, dijo la ministra, será necesaria \" una inversión en los próximos 10 años de unos 40 millones de dólares, por lo que el Gobierno ya ha empezado con ese proceso de estructuración \". La titular de la cartera de Ambiente consideró que para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero al 2030, Colombia debe aprovechar su 'mina de oro', que \" se llama biodiversidad y agua, y, sí, podemos aplicar la innovación, el conocimiento, la ciencia, para generar una reindustrialización \".\n(Vea: ¿Pánico energético? ¿Crisis climática? ).\nPor eso, explicó, el portafolio pretende \" promover procesos de transición socio-ecológica y energética justa, que fortalezcan la gobernanza y contribuyan a la construcción de una paz total y un desarrollo sostenible en favor de la vida \".\n\" Este Gobierno va a dejar las estructuras financieras, regulatorias y el acuerdo social y económico, para que la transición hacia esa nueva economía se dé más allá del papel \", manifestó Muhamad. Medio ambiente iStock} En la 'Feria de economías para la vida' también participó el expresidente del Gobierno español José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, quien se refirió a la necesidad que tienen las naciones de \"ecologizar la economía como camino a una mayor justicia social\".\n(Vea: En nueve meses se han presentado más de 400 mil incendios forestales en Suramérica ).\n\" Ecologizar la economía es un camino para convertirla en una visión más humanitaria y menos productivista \", afirmó el expresidente del Gobierno español, que cree que \" si no hay igualdad \", no habrá \" ni sociedades pacíficas ni democracias en el futuro \".\nAl referirse a los procesos de transición energética en el mundo y particularmente en Europa, Rodríguez Zapatero expresó que el sur de ese continente hoy produce energía de manera más competitiva porque cuenta con más fuentes energéticas limpias.\n\" Actualmente, la inversión energética en el mundo va a los sitios donde hay más potencialidad de energías y de hacer una transición justa \", dijo.\nRodríguez Zapatero agregó: \" España, a pesar de lo que creen algunos, nunca llegó a tiempo a una revolución industrial y seguramente como Colombia, es la primera vez en la historia que vamos a llegar a una revolución económica como es la transición energética, y eso es fundamental \".\n(Vea: Financiación de la biodiversidad en Colombia requiere de más recursos ).

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Growing Incidence of Chronic Diseases is Driving the Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market; says TNR\nGlobal Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market is Anticipated to Reach USD 17.3 Bn by 2031, at a CAGR of 6% (2023 - 2031)\nWILMINGTON, DELAWARE, UNITED STATES, December 28, 2023 / EINPresswire.com / -- Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market Introduction\nThe global oral clinical nutritional supplement market has witnessed substantial growth and evolution in recent years, driven by a convergence of factors that highlight the increasing importance of targeted nutritional support in healthcare. These supplements, available in various formulations and tailored to address specific health conditions or deficiencies, play a pivotal role in meeting the diverse dietary needs of individuals globally. Stringent regulations governing their production, labeling, and distribution ensure that consumers receive products that meet high-quality standards, further bolstering trust and demand in the market.\nGet Sample Copy of the Report\nUnderstanding Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement\nOral clinical nutritional supplements are specialized products designed to provide targeted nutrients in a convenient form for individuals who may have difficulty meeting their dietary requirements through regular food intake alone. These supplements come in various forms such as liquids, powders, capsules, or gels and are formulated to address specific nutritional needs or health conditions. These supplements are formulated to support various health conditions or deficiencies. For instance, there are formulations specifically designed for elderly individuals to support bone health or cognitive function, while others might focus on aiding digestion or managing metabolic disorders.\nGlobal Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market Key Highlights\nIn 2022, oral clinical nutritional supplements were highly prescribed for malnutrition. In 2022, it was predicted that 149 million children under the age of five were stunted (too short for their age), 45 million were wasted (too thin for their height), and 37 million were overweight or obese. Thus to overcome these health issues oral clinical nutritional supplements play a crucial role in managing malnutrition by providing concentrated and readily available nutrients to individuals.\nSpeak to our analyst in case of queries before buying this report\nThe aging population across many regions has also significantly contributed to the expansion of this market. With advancing age comes an increased need for specialized nutritional support to address age-related health concerns. For instance, according to a research, the number of individuals aged 60 and more in Asia is predicted to more than quadruple, from 535 million in 2015 to 1.3 billion in 2050. With around 4.7 billion people living in Asia - almost 60% of the world's total - the worldwide trend towards an ageing population is projected to have a substantial influence. Malnutrition is more frequent in elderly individuals, and with one-fifth of the Asian population expected to be over the age of 80 by 2050, the issue is projected to become a significant burden on the healthcare system in the future years.\nNorth America had the highest share in the oral clinical nutritional supplement market in 2022. North America especially United States has a relatively high prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus oral clinical nutritional supplements play a crucial role in managing these conditions and aiding in recovery, contributing to their widespread use.\nKey Developments in the Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market\nIn December 2023, Roche has announced a formal merger agreement to acquire Carmot Therapeutics, Inc., which has a research and development portfolio that includes clinical stage subcutaneous and oral incretins for the treatment of obese individuals with and without diabetes.\nRequest for customization to meet your precise research requirements\nKey Companies in the Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market:\no Abbott\no Amway\no Baxter\no Bayer AG\no Cargill, Incorporated.\no Danone Nutricia\no Lactalis Nutrition Santé\no Mead Johnson & Company, LLC.

    "title": "Torreblanca relanza el PAI del Golf al garantizar agua desalada",
    "text": "El pleno de la localidad de Torreblanca ha dado luz verde a uno de los proyectos más importantes de los últimos años: el convenio entre Acuamed y el Ayuntamiento que facilita, de facto, poder avanzar en el PAI del golf la estar garantizado el suministro hídrico.Un convenio que la nueva alcaldesa, la popular Tania Agut , ha resuelto en solo un año frente a la gestión del anterior gobierno quien no logró avanzar en cerrar este importante acuerdo. De hecho, desde 2017 se estaba tramitando la urgencia de este acuerdo que vio ayer la luz. La alcaldesa manifestaba que «es un paso muy importante ya que nos hace falta el agua para el desarrollo urbanístico» y, una vez adjudicado el PAI, «la Conselleria nos daba un plazo hasta el 11 de agosto para garantizar el desarrollo urbanístico».El acuerdo aprobado ayer se trata de un último paso ya que la necesidad de garantizar el agua es clave para el desarrollo urbano, de la zona de la playa, los polígonos y el golf. Además, es un acuerdo similar al que ya tienen localidades como Benicàssim, Oropesa y Cabanes, así como Moncofa y que, además, ha contado con el visto bueno de los técnicos y la Abogacía del Estado y los técnicos municipales. La alcaldesa había estado avanzando en las negociaciones con Acuamed para garantizar el suministro hídrico. «La firma de este convenio es un paso más, a falta de que CHJ nos dé la concesión definitiva del agua tras la firma de este convenio, ya habremos cumplimentado el expediente de adjudicación y cumplido con los condicionantes establecidos por la Dirección General de Urbanismo», ha destacado la alcaldesa. «Una vez que hemos logrado reactivar este proyecto, desde el nuevo equipo de Gobierno municipal seguimos trabajando decididamente para que este proyecto pase a ser una realidad que impulse el turismo y el empleo en el municipio las próximas décadas. Hemos hecho las cosas bien y por fin, después de más de 20 años de tramitación, pudimos adjudicar el PAI del golf, luego propiciamos que hubiese una empresa que quisiera impulsarlo y ahora hemos aprobado el convenio para garantizar que habrá agua suficiente para llevarlo a cabo. Esto es sinónimo de crecimiento y oportunidades para Torreblanca». Rosana Villanueva, concejala de Urbanismo, señalaba que «la aprobación de este convenio del Ayuntamiento de Torreblanca con Acuamed es fundamental para conseguir los derechos del agua necesarios para el municipio, ya que es un requisito indispensable para las resoluciones favorables de la CHJ y la Generalitat Valenciana». L a portavoz de Compromís en la localidad, Miriam Pañella , quiso poner de manifiesto que «por desgracia lo que traemos al pleno es especulación pura con un elemento tan fundamental como es el agua para nuestro futuro» y denunciaba que «se supedita todo al PAI del Golf» ya que «la realidad es que a Torreblanca no le hace falta agua, es al Golf» y criticaba que «mientras que vamos a pagar 6.347 metros cúbicos de agua, cuando nos hacen falta 1.3000 metros cúbicos».Por su parte, la ex alcaldesa y portavoz del PSPV, Josefa Tena , denunciaba que «el PP no ha hecho nada y en este punto no sabemos cuánto nos va a costar a cada vecino de Torreblanca este convenio» ya que, según la socialista, «no dispone ni de una memoria económica».La alcaldesa defendía en el pleno que «todos los informes garantizan la legalidad» y explicaba que «en este convenio se contempla que lo financie Acuamed que es el cambio radical respecto a lo que quería aprobar el anterior gobierno», subrayaba la alcaldesa.",

    "text": "Thaïlande Canicule en Asie du Sud-Est : des îles paradisiaques mythiques en soif d'eau Alors que la température maximale ressentie a dépassé les 52°C à Bangkok, l'archipel touristique de Koh Phi-Phi est en pénurie d'eau depuis des mois. En Thaïlande, l'archipel touristique de Koh Phi-Phi, rendu célèbre par le film La Plage avec Leonardo DiCaprio, et d'autres îles paradisiaques souffrent actuellement d'une grave pénurie d'eau, ont déclaré jeudi un responsable du tourisme et des habitants de la région. Situé au large de Phuket, Koh Phi Phi attire chaque année des centaines de milliers de visiteurs pour ses plages de sable blanc et ses eaux turquoises. Mais ces dernières semaines, [une vague exceptionnelle de chaleur sèche s'est abattue sur toute l'Asie du Sud-Est](/environnement/2024/04/29/pres-de-50-c-en-birmanie-une-chaleur-extreme-accable-l-asie-du-sud-est), faisant tomber les records et baisser de façon draconienne le niveau des réservoirs. Les hôtels se vident « La compagnie privée qui fournit de l'eau aux îles pourrait devoir arrêter l'approvisionnement », a déclaré Wichupan Phukaoluan Srisanya, présidente de l'Association des hôteliers de la région de Krabi. « Mais nous voulons assurer aux touristes qui prévoient de visiter les îles que nous pouvons gérer cette situation », a-t-elle ajouté. Les autorités envisagent d'acheminer de l'eau depuis le continent si la saison des pluies tarde à arriver. Des habitants, qui ont demandé à ne pas être nommés, ont déclaré que les pénuries d'eau duraient depuis des mois et que certains hôtels étaient presque vides à cause de cela. Sur le site d'évaluation TripAdvisor, un internaute a écrit que l'eau ne coulait plus dans son hôtel et d'autres messages invitaient les voyageurs de « vérifier que leur logement dispose d'eau douce » avant le séjour. Une température ressentie dépassant les 52°C Dans le golfe de Thaïlande, Koh Samui, une autre île touristique très populaire, a connu un temps sec et chaud similaire, mais les visiteurs n'ont pas été affectés, selon l'office de tourisme local. Un camion-citerne fait des allers-retours avec le continent, « mais cela multiplie par trois le coût de fonctionnement des hôtels », a déclaré Ratchaparon Poolsawadee, président de l'association touristique de Koh Samui. Pendant près d'une semaine en avril, les autorités de Bangkok ont émis quotidiennement des avertissements de chaleur extrême, la « température ressentie » ayant dépassé les 52°C. Le changement climatique induit par l'homme entraînera des canicules plus fréquentes, plus longues et plus intenses, avertissent régulièrement les scientifiques. Si le phénomène El Niño contribue au climat exceptionnellement chaud de cette année, l'Asie se réchauffe également plus rapidement que la moyenne mondiale, selon l'Organisation météorologique mondiale de l'ONU. Une île fermée à cause d'un blanchissement de coraux L'accès à l'île de Pling et aux récifs de coraux se trouvant autour du parc national de Sirinart à Phuket est temporairement fermé en raison du blanchissement important de coraux [causé par la hausse de la température de l'eau](/environnement/2024/03/07/temperature-record-des-oceans-vers-une-extinction-massive-des-coraux) qui y a été observée, a indiqué le Département des parcs nationaux et de la conservation de la faune et de la flore (DNP). La fermeture de l'accès ce jeudi à ces sites intervient en raison du stress thermique subi par les récifs coralliens à la suite d'une vague de chaleur exceptionnelle qui a affecté ces dernières semaines la Thaïlande et l'ensemble de l'Asie du Sud-Est. Le DPA surveille également la situation dans les parcs nationaux à Koh Chang, Koh Samet, Chumphon, Koh Surin, Phang Nga Bay, les îles Phi Phi et à Lanta. En avril, l'Agence américaine d'observation océanique et atmosphérique (NOAA) avait averti que le monde connaissait actuellement, pour la deuxième fois en dix ans, un épisode massif de blanchissement des coraux du fait de températures océaniques records.",
