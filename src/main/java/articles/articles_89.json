    "title": "New York’s minimum-wage bump goes into effect — here’s how much Big Apple workers will be making",
    "text": "New York’s minimum-wage workers had more than just a new year to celebrate on Monday — as the ball drop ushered in a series of annual pay bumps that took effect when the clock struck midnight. The minimum wage in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County ticked $1 higher, from $15 to $16. In the remainder of New York State, the new minimum wage is $15, up from $14.20. The state’s minimum wage is expected to increase every year until it reaches $17 in New York City and its suburbs, or $16 in the rest of the state by 2026 under an agreement between Gov. Kathy Hochul and legislative leaders announced last April. The deal came over the objections of some employers, as well as some liberal Democrats who said it didn’t go high enough. Future hikes will be tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a key measurement of inflation. The figures are well above the United States’ federal minimum of $7.25 per hour, the going rate since 2009. New York is one of 22 states getting minimum wage hikes in the new year, according to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute. States and some localities, however, are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states, including California and Connecticut, have recently done so, raising hourly wages 50 cents to $16 in the Golden State, and 69 cents to $15.69 in the Nutmeg State. Meanwhile, Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub workers can expect to rake in more — $17.96 per hour — working in the Big Apple after losing their second attempt to block New York City’s minimum wage law targeting the app-based firms. The ruling by a state appeals court last month forces the ubiquitous delivery services to either pay couriers the flat hourly rate of $17.96, plus tips, or pay per delivery at about 50 cents a minute. The appeals court rejected efforts by the companies to overturn a September 2023 decision by New York Acting Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Moyne to allow the law to go into effect, mandating that Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub pay their gig workers the increased hourly rate, which will rise to nearly $20 in April 2025. Previously, the apps’ delivery workers in the city earned about $11 an hour on average after expenses, far below the city’s $15 minimum wage. Mayor Eric Adams said at the time of the December ruling that it was a “win for working New Yorkers,” calling the decision “a powerful tool to hold apps accountable.” “Our delivery workers have consistently delivered for us — now, we are delivering for them,” Adams added. Uber, meanwhile, also had to dish out $290 million last month to settle accusations from New York’s attorney general that its ride-sharing business has been “stealing earnings” from thousands of Big Apple drivers for years. The massive sum accounts for back pay, paid sick leave, proper hiring and earnings notices and other improvements to drivers’ working conditions. Lyft was ordered to pay $38 million as part of the settlement. New York Attorney General Letitia James said more than 100,000 drivers throughout New York are entitled to receive settlement funds — implying an average payout of $3,280. Newer drivers who began after 2017 are not eligible for any additional payments, though James assured that along with the settlement, Uber and Lyft have agreed to provide “new benefits for leave, payment, training and job support.” These improved benefits — which include up to one week of paid sick leave per year — are set to take effect no later than Feb. 29, 2024. Eligible drivers can file a claim to receive additional funds they are owed, James said. Minneapolis legislators proposed a rule last year that the state implement a similar minimum wage rule that says drivers be paid at least $1.40 per miles and $0.51 per minute, though Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed the mandate, which would have otherwise gone into effect on Jan. 1, 2024.

    "text": "SAN DIEGO — Becoming a more sustainable business is a series of small steps for Eric Van Drunen.\nVan Drunen is the owner and winemaker of Charlie & Echo , an urban winery in San Diego producing natural craft wine from local vineyards.\nWhat You Need To Know The California Green Business Network focuses on improving energy and water efficiency, reducing waste and improving air quality\nSmall businesses who are achieving the Green Business certification are making a big impact\nAccording to the network, Green Businesses have diverted a thousand garbage-trucks-worth of waste from the landfill and saved 2 million bathtubs of fresh drinking water\nThere were more than 4,700 certified Green Businesses in California last year Van Drunen said they're the first winery tasting room in Southern California to be certified as a California Green Business, and the first tasting room of any kind to be certified in San Diego County. The California Green Business certification focuses on improving energy and water efficiency, reducing waste and improving air quality.\n“It’s great that there is a certification because after all that, it is nice to have some recognition,\" he said. \"I actually went through all the process and did this thing.”\nVan Drunen said the certification checklist has lots of little changes, from switching to toilet paper made from 100% recycled paper to installing a water filtration system to provide customers with water instead of buying jugs of water.\nRobert Carr is part of the California Green Business Network. He helped guide Charlie & Echo through the changes, and said small businesses are achieving a big impact.\n“You can’t really fix anything you don’t measure so I think going in there and getting the audit and understanding what you’re doing so far and things you can do, it gives them kind of a benchmark on what they can do,” Carr said.\nCarr said in 2023, Green Businesses have diverted a thousand garbage-trucks-worth of waste from the landfill, saved 2 million bathtubs of fresh drinking water, and conserved enough energy to power 4,500 houses for an entire year.\nCarr said meeting all the requirements can be daunting, but they are here to help and hope to get even more businesses to join their cause.\n“It’s a journey, really. And so to start the process of just understanding where you are, and find things you can do, and do those,\" Carr said. \"And the things you can’t, maybe take some times and figure out ways you can do that but don’t let the sustainability discourage you because you can’t do all of it.”\nVan Drunen said he also switched out all his cleaning supplies to the nontoxic variety. While he might be one of the first to achieve the California Green Business certification in Southern California, he hopes his effort will inspire other business owners to follow his example.\n“I guess those are bragging rights. I don’t want to be able to brag too much. It’d be nice just to have more people do it,” Van Drunen said.\nAccording to the California Green Business Network, there were more than 4,700 certified Green Businesses in California last year; and more than 22,000 businesses have received technical assistance.",

    "text": "Rabain reopens P1 enrolment at second primary school\nThe Government has made another about-turn and reopened P1 enrolment for the 2025-26 school year for another primary school.\nIn a statement tonight, Diallo Rabain, the Minister of Education, said that enrolment at Somerset Primary School will be allowed.\nLast week, the Government [backtracked](https://www.royalgazette.com/education/news/article/20241130/ministry-rethinks-p1-enrolment-at-st-georges-prep/) on its decision to halt P1 enrolment at St George’s Preparatory School after meeting with the school’s Parent Teacher Association.\nMr Rabain said that the reopening of enrolment at Somerset Primary School was made for the same reason, adding that he had met with that school’s PTA yesterday.\nDuring the discussions, Mr Rabain heard the community’s desire to continue enrolment until the school closes in a major shake-up of the education system.\nExplaining his decision, Mr Rabain said: “It should be noted that the initial decision to pause P1 enrolments was made with careful consideration of its long-term implications.\n“Specifically, discontinuing P1 enrolments allows for a natural phase-out at both schools and this approach reduces the number of students who would later face the challenge of transitioning to a new school.\n“Allowing continued P1 enrolments would lead to a larger student body needing to navigate the eventual closure and relocation process.\n“Both of these PTA executives, after understanding the potential impacts, ultimately chose to continue P1 enrolments, which we consider as the most disruptive option.\n“However, the ministry appreciates that P1 enrolment is an important and sensitive time for parents, and we remain committed to providing the necessary support to help families navigate this process.\n“I want to thank the PTA executives and parents of both schools for their thoughtful advocacy as we work together to ensure a smooth enrolment process for the 2025-26 school year.”\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said that because of “technical limitations” with the existing online P1 application system, a separate process had been developed for parents wishing to register for the first time or amend an earlier application.\nApplicants for both Somerset Primary and St George’s Prep are asked to use the following link: [bit.ly/P1_Somerset_Prep](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsfTLYijZsF5CKFf6d6NmIsX9JJHBU7QIWxdmejo37H-UJSA/viewform).\nApplications for other primary schools should be made through [bit.ly/Register-Student](https://registration.powerschool.com/family/Login?ReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fregistration.powerschool.com%2Ffamily%2Fdirectaction&AutoLogOut=False).\nThe spokeswoman added: “Parents who have already submitted a P1 application must resubmit an updated one to indicate their interest in St George’s Prep or Somerset Primary.\n“Applications submitted without this update will not be processed for these schools, and the original submission will remain in effect.\nSomerset Primary will be holding an open house on Tuesday next week. Parents wanting to learn more about St George’s Prep are asked to contact the school on 297-0370 to schedule an appointment.\nThe deadline for registrations has been extended to December 13. Applications received after this date will be considered late and processed only after all on-time applications have been reviewed.\n[click here](#).\n[Terms of Service](/terms-of-service)will be banned.",
