    "text": "India has been ranked 134 out of 193 countries in the 2022 United Nations Human Development Index (HDI), a notch higher than 135 out of 191 countries in 2021. In the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, India has been ranked 108 out of 193 countries with a score of 0.437. Earlier, its rank was 122 out of 191 countries with a score of 0.490 in the GII-2021. As per the women and child development ministry, this marked a significant jump of 14 ranks on the GII-2022 vis-a-vis the GII-2021. Furthermore, in the just released 2023/24 Human Development Report (HDR), India&apos;s HDI value has increased to 0.644 in 2022, placing the country at 134 out of 193 countries and territories. This comes after a drop in its HDI value in 2021 and a flat trend over the past few years.\nHere is what you need to know\nThe data was published in the United Nations Development Programme&apos;s report titled \"Breaking the Gridlock: Reimagining Cooperation in a Polarized World\".\nIndia saw improvements across all HDI indicators including life expectancy, education, and gross national income (GNI) per capita. Life expectancy rose from 67.2 to 67.7 years, expected years of schooling reached 12.6, mean years of schooling increased to 6.57 and GNI per capita saw an increase from USD 6,542 to USD 6,951 in 2022.\nIndia demonstrated progress in reducing gender inequality. The country&apos;s GII value of 0.437 is better than the global and South Asian averages, according to the report.\n\"India has shown remarkable progress,\" says the report\nThe report said, \"India has shown remarkable progress in human development over the years. Since 1990, life expectancy at birth has risen by 9.1 years, expected years of schooling have increased by 4.6 years and mean years of schooling have grown by 3.8 years. India&apos;s GNI per capita has grown by approximately 287 per cent.\"\nThe UNDP report also states that inequality across the world is rising again. It further said that the gap between the richest and poorest countries has started to widen from 2020, after 20 years of convergence.\n(With inputs from Aaquil Jameel.)",

Cold wave is a situation when either temperature after sunset scales down below 10 degrees Celsius or minimum temperature is below the normal levels by 5 degrees Celsius.\nAt the same time, dense fog has been predicted in the next few days in the five districts in the northern sector of West Bengal namely Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and North Dinajpur. Fog has also been predicted in certain districts in South Bengal -- Purulia, Bankura and West Burdwan -- in the early morning hours.\nEven the state capital Kolkata has started to feel the pinch of cold wind since Thursday. The maximum temperature in Kolkata on Thursday was 24.3 degrees Celsius, which was 2.7 degrees lower than the normal level.\nThe minimum temperature in Kolkata on Thursday was 13.8 degrees Celsius, which was 2.3 degrees lower than the normal level. The maximum and minimum relative humidity in the city on Thursday were 96 per cent and 40 per cent respectively.\nThe Regional Meteorological Office has predicted maximum and minimum temperatures in Kolkata to scale down further during the next couple of days. As per weather office productions, on Friday the maximum and minimum temperatures in Kolkata will be around the same as it was on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, the latest average Air Quality Index (AQI) index in Kolkata has been recorded at 285, which comes in the “purple” or “very unhealthy” category.\nEnvironmentalists and doctors have advised children and people with respiratory problems to avoid outdoor activities during this period as far as possible. The AQI levels, like every year, started deteriorating after Kali Puja and Diwali in October and the deterioration is continuing.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/national/cold-wave-conditions-in-five-bengal-districts-says-met-office/)",

    "text": "jam session\nFormerly homeless Austin band tunes up for 6th annual community concert\nThere's no shortage of conversations about the Austin music community, but it's not always clear who that includes. It could an in-crowd of successful locals or a larger selection of those who lived here at some point. It could be the underground punk scene or a kindred group of intellectuals coming out of the music program at the University of Texas.\nWhatever the boundaries, folks chatting at venues or reading local mags may not be thinking of a significant portion of the area's musicians: our unhoused neighbors.\nHome Street Music, a nonprofit that brings together professionals, volunteers, and formerly homeless artists at the Community First! Village, is working on integrating all of the above.\nThe program is hosting its sixth annual Community Awareness Event on May 18, showcasing a variety of musicians whose shared value is being involved in music together.\nThe free two-hour event is bookended by opening and closing remarks — plus a song — by Westlake High School\njazz musician Vidhur Seshadri. Founder of Home Street Music Vanessa Lively will take the reins for an introduction, and then six (or more) program participants will give an hour-long concert. After the music, some of the participants will share their personal stories.\nEach has a profile via Home Street that gives a taste of what kinds insights they may share:\n- Drummer and Navy veteran Jeff Vestal is a regular contributor at meetings, from setting up the event to \"hold[ing] down the rhythm section.\"\n- Percussionist Al Perez has had a hand in several areas of the music making, starting with shakers and later singing. He brings his bongos to meetings.\n- Singer Jim \"Jimmie Bones\" Lanzrath brings the blues, and is known for his skills in improvisation — an important aspect of communal music-making.\n- Poet Kate Stevenson, originally from the United Kingdom, debuts her work at meetings and contributes a friendly spirit that supports the interpersonal connection.\n- Musician Blair Racine, nicknamed \"The Mayor,\" facilitates collaboration by sharing stories and creative suggestions. Like a conductor or creative director, he finds what's special about each player.\n- Songwriter and Detroit native Scott Osborn gets into the nitty-gritty music theory, singing as well as playing the guitar and keyboard.\n\"Our goal is to create a safe space where individuals can express themselves through music, art, and community,\" said Lively in a press release. \"Through our programs, we have witnessed transformative changes in our participants, including boosted self-confidence, proud self-expression, and stronger connections to the greater community.”\nSome participants, like Osborn, have a long history with music, but others barely had any experience at all when starting out. Like many Community First\nprojects, these meetings highlight a wealth of talent that the local industry hasn't accessed or promoted, while inviting others in to develop their own skills.\n\"It really makes you feel special,” said folk musician and gathering leader\nJohann Wagner. “The sessions are really cover band meets original band meets best party in the world.”\nHome Street Music's sixth annual Community Awareness Event is free and family friendly. It will be held at St. Martin's (606 W. 15th Street) from 5-7 pm on May 18. RSVP on\nEventbrite.",

    "text": "Family of crash victim ‘humbled’ by new TN law imposing harsher penalties for distracted teen drivers Conrad was killed in July 2020, when his car was hit from behind by a distracted driver, pushing his vehicle into oncoming traffic. His wife, Joslyn Conrad, was seriously hurt. LEBANON, Tenn. (WSMV) - A new law in Tennessee going into effect on Jan. 1 will impose harsher penalties on teenage drivers who are caught driving distracted. [The bill,](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0589) named after Wilson County business owner, Eddie Conrad, means seven points will be charged to the driver’s license of anyone under 18 if they’re caught texting or looking at their phone. Conrad was killed in July 2020, when his car was hit from behind by a distracted driver, pushing his vehicle into oncoming traffic. His wife, Joslyn Conrad, was seriously hurt. “It’s very humbling, Eddie would be very humbled if this bill could save one person’s life,” Joslyn Conrad said. “It took a situation like this, here in this hometown, to bring attention to what needed to be taken care of a long time ago.” Tennessee already has a Hands-Free Law preventing the use of holding your phone while driving, but amended the Eddie Conrad Act to not charge adults points on their license for distracted driving. A recent USAA study for the first half of 2023 showed Tennessee was a top 10 state for having the most distracted drivers. “I really hope it does help out and save a life, and wake up the kids who are now driving,” Eddie’s son, Brian Conrad said. “I want them to know when they take their eyes off the road for 3-4 seconds, you’re traveling two football fields. Realize what’s in front of you, keep your eyes on the road, it could be your family one day.” Eddie Conrad, who was 75, was the longtime owner of Conrad Construction. His family is carrying on his legacy every chance they get, with pictures and memories of him on their business walls and work attire. After Eddie’s death, the Conrad family posted a billboard, raising awareness against distracted driving. Copyright 2023 WSMV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "NEUQUEN.- Un proyecto sancionado por la Legislatura local generó una fuerte reacción del gremio de trabajadores de la educación de esta provincia (ATEN), que realizó un paro de 48 horas y una movilización que contó con la presencia de referentes de CTERA a nivel nacional. En asambleas, definirán si retoman o no las clases tras las vacaciones de invierno para expresar su repudio a la normativa, que todavía no fue reglamentada por el Poder Ejecutivo. La ley, presentada por el diputado del Movimiento Popular Neuquino (MPN), Claudio Domínguez, establece el pago de un plus salarial del 15% a los docentes que registren menos de tres inasistencias por trimestre. La iniciativa contó con 25 votos a favor y tres en contra, provenientes de diputados del Frente de Izquierda y Unión por la Patria.\nEl autor del proyecto aclaró que el incentivo busca pagar un plus a los trabajadores de la educación y aclaró que “de ninguna manera será un instrumento que busque recortar algún derecho” . En una entrevista con LM Neuquén , afirmó que “el docente va a seguir cobrando el sueldo como lo cobra, es solo un plus para que cumpla con no faltar más de tres días en el trimestre”.\nGremios docentes manifestándose en Neuquén.",
