    "text": "Rosemont, Ill. – The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) issued the following statement following Medical Mutual’s [change](https://www.aana.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Anesthesia_Reimbursement_Policy-effective-2025-1-24.pdf) in reimbursement policy for anesthesia:\n“In an ideal world, health insurers would assist their customers with health care costs rather than inflate their profits and hinder those customers from getting the care they so desperately need,” said Jan Setnor, President of the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology, MSN, CRNA, Col. (Ret), USAFR, NC. “Yet Medical Mutual has mimicked the attempt by both [Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield ](https://www.aana.com/news/anthem-anesthesia-reimbursement-changes-highlight-need-for-hhs-to-enforce-aca-provider-non-discrimination-provision/)and [Kaiser Permanente ](https://www.aana.com/news/kaiser-foundation-health-plan-reimbursement-changes-highlight-need-for-hhs-to-enforce-aca-provider-non-discrimination-provision/)by arbitrarily, and without justification, slashing CRNA reimbursement by fifteen percent. This policy announcement is a blatant, dangerous, and self-serving attack on CRNAs and the patients they seek to care for.”\nThe Medical Mutual policy [change ](https://www.aana.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Anesthesia_Reimbursement_Policy-effective-2025-1-24.pdf)will reduce certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) reimbursement to only 85 percent, effective January 24, 2025. CRNAs are anesthesia providers who are often the only ones available in rural communities, including in rural communities within Ohio, where Medical Mutual is headquartered.\n“CRNAs are often the only anesthesia providers in the rural communities across the nation, including rural communities in Ohio where Medical Mutual is headquartered. The attempt by insurers to restrict their practice, underscores the critical need for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to enforce the nondiscrimination provision, and is why AANA continues its litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to compel HHS to enforce the law.”\nIt is the AANA’s position that Medical Mutual follow Anthem and Kaiser’s lead by reversing course on this discriminatory and dangerous policy that is in violation of the nondiscrimination provision within the Affordable Care Act.\nMEDIA CONTACT\n[Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)",

    "text": "On a day marked by dramatic shifts in the stock market, one story stands out not just for the sheer scale of its impact but for the future it heralds for the tech and renewable energy sectors. American Rare Earths, a company at the forefront of mineral exploration and development in Australia and the United States, recently announced a staggering 64% increase in its estimated In-Situ Resources, totaling 2.34 billion tons with a concentration of 3196 ppm TREO. This announcement not only sent the company's share price soaring over 130% but also underscored a significant leap forward in the quest for sustainability and technological advancement.\nA New Era for American Rare Earths\nThe revelation by American Rare Earths (ASX ARR | OTCQB ARRNF | FSE 1BHA) about the substantial upgrade in their resource base at the Halleck Creek rare earths project has not only caught the attention of investors but has also sparked conversations about the strategic importance of rare earth elements. These elements, crucial for the manufacture of everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and defense systems, have become a pivotal resource in the global push towards green energy and technological innovation. The company's CEO hailed this milestone as a transformative moment, not just for American Rare Earths but for the rare earth industry as a whole.\nMarket Reactions and Broader Implications\nThe stock market responded with fervor to the announcement, reflecting broader trends in the investment community that prioritize sustainable and tech-driven opportunities. Alongside American Rare Earths, other companies like Dateline Resources and Way2VAT also experienced significant share price movements, following promising drilling results and the launch of innovative projects, respectively. However, Prodigy Gold's share price took a hit, falling by 37.5% amid swirling rumors, highlighting the volatile nature of the market and the diverse factors influencing investor sentiment.\nThe Path Forward: Sustainability and Innovation\nThe strategic significance of American Rare Earths' resource upgrade extends beyond the immediate financial gains. It represents a critical step towards securing a more sustainable and technologically advanced future. The increased availability of rare earth elements could accelerate the development of green technologies, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and enhance the global supply chain's resilience. Moreover, this development is a testament to the role of innovation in unlocking new possibilities and the importance of continued exploration and investment in critical resources.\nIn summary, the recent developments at American Rare Earths, coupled with significant share price movements among other key players in the market, highlight a pivotal moment for the tech and renewable energy sectors. The substantial upgrade in rare earth resources at the Halleck Creek project not only offers a brighter outlook for American Rare Earths but also signals a broader shift towards sustainability and technological advancement. As the world continues to navigate the challenges of climate change and technological evolution, the role of rare earth elements and the companies that explore and develop these resources will undoubtedly become increasingly central.",

    "text": "Antibiotics have long been one of humanity’s greatest weapons in combating disease and death. In fact, they appear to have been so useful that people have gone too far in their use, to the point that the antibiotic shield itself appears to have become a danger. A former chief medical officer for England has warned the world of a growing antibiotic emergency that could claim millions of lives over the coming years and will have drastic impacts on people across the globe. As per estimates, death rates from antimicrobial resistance (AMR) AMRs will be doubled by this year and almost 40 million people are expected to lose their lives to superbugs over the next 25 years. The elderly are expected to be the ones most at risk. Simply put, AMR often results from the excessive and/or inappropriate use of antibiotics, a problem particularly prevalent in poorer countries like Pakistan with weak enforcement of rules governing the purchase and use of medications, with AMR leading to around 700,000 deaths annually in the country as infections caused by bacteria that are not responding to third- and fourth-generation antibiotics according to health experts.\nThis makes AMR the third leading cause of death in Pakistan. Aside from misuse of antibiotics, AMR is also reportedly spread by the fact that about 70 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock, prompting resistance to evolve in animals. While it is not exactly clear what can be done about the use of antibiotics among livestock, one certain thing is the need to strengthen regulations surrounding antibiotic use throughout the country. One of the side effects of the gross inadequacy of our health services has been the unchecked rise of self-medication and diagnosis and health experts have now revealed that an alarming 70 per cent of antibiotics are being used unnecessarily in Pakistan. However, it is hard to blame many ordinary people for self-medicating and diagnosing when there is barely one physician for every thousand people in the country and almost half of the population lacks access to basic health services. Then there is the fact that pharmacies often do not bother to ask for a prescription when selling drugs that require them and that even trained physicians are not always averse to giving unjustified prescriptions for antibiotics, as per health experts.\nThis likely explains why Pakistan is the world’s third-largest consumer of antibiotics after India and China, with antibiotic medicines worth Rs126 billion consumed in the country in 2023 alone. Aside from stricter supervision of doctors and those pretending to be doctors, there also needs to be an expansion of healthcare services in the country to cope with this issue. People need to be able to get a diagnosis and a consultation at affordable prices to ensure that they are prescribed the right medication and not given antibiotics unnecessarily. Moreover, the unbridled access to medication as long as one has the cash has to end. This means cracking down on pharmacies issuing antibiotics and other drugs without a prescription and those selling medication without a licence. The consequences for not doing so could be a superbug that makes the COVID pandemic look relatively less lethal and simple to deal with.",

    "text": "Roma-Milan 2-1 Roma (4-4-2): Svilar; Celik, Mancini, Smalling, Spinazzola; El Shaarawy, Bove (36' st Renato Sanches), Paredes, Pellegrini (36' st Angelino); Dybala (43' pt Llorente), Lukaku (28' pt Abraham).

(57 Sportiello, 69 Nava, 7 Adli, 28 Thiaw, 38 Terracciano, 85 Zeroli, 95 Bartesaghi). All.: Pioli. Arbitro: Marciniak (Polonia). Reti: nel pt 12' Mancini, 22' Dybala; nel st 41' Gabbia. Angoli: 11 a 0 per il Milan. Recupero: 7' e 5'. Espulsi: Celik per gioco falloso. Ammoniti: Gabbia per gioco falloso, Adli, Jovic e Calabria comportamento non regolamentare. Spettatori: 66.025. Una Roma bella e concreta vola in semifinale di Europa League nella magica serata dai due volti, nel solito Olimpico sold out. Nei primi venti minuti i giallorossi mettono alle corde il Milan e in cassaforte la qualificazione con i gol di Mancini (che fa il bis dopo San Siro dedicando l’1-0 al suo conoscente stretto e giovane calciatore morto lunedì) e Dybala, ma poi dalla mezz'ora restano in dieci per il fallaccio di Celik su Leao e sono costretti a dover resistere per tutto il match agli attacchi veementi dei rossoneri facendo anche a meno dei muscoli di Lukaku fuori per infortunio. Forcing milanista che porta all’unico gol di Gabbia nel finale per un 2-1 per la squadra di De Rossi, confermato proprio stamattina per il prossimo futuro sulla panchina giallorossa, che dovrà affrontare i campioni di Germania del Bayer Leverkusen per sognare la finalissima di Dublino. Nel Milan torta titolare Tomori che rientra dopo la squalifica, a sorpresa a centrocampo spazio a Musah al posto di Reijnders, mentre in avanti fiducia a Giroud e Leao. De Rossi si affida a Bove a centrocampo per sostituire Cristante squalificato e al tridente Dybala, Lukaku, El Shaarawy. Pronti via con la Roma subito pericolosa con Lukaku e che nei primi minuti si mostra più presente nell’area del Milan costretto a fare subito due falli pesanti prima su Dybala e poi su Bove per frenare i giallorossi. Passano solo 12 minuti e la squadra di De Rossi passa in vantaggio ancora con Mancini che come all’andata firma l’1-0: destro a giro di Pellegrini che colpisce il palo, sulla respinta è lesto è il difensore giallorosso che di piatto a porta vuota spinge in rete. L’esultanza di Mancini è commovente con i suoi compagni che lo baciano e lo abbracciano per il lutto subito lcon la morte del fratello del fidanzato di sua sorella, il giovane calciatore Mattia Giani. A lui il difensore della Roma dedica il gol mostrando una maglia con la scritta \"Ciao Mattia per sempre con noi\". La reazione del Milan non si fa attendere: i rossoneri provano a pareggiare subito con il tiro di Loftus-Cheek che si infrange sulla traversa, ma si sbilanciano troppo e dieci minuti dopo aver subito lo svantaggio incassano il secondo gol con un bel contropiede della Roma. Lukaku vince il duello di fisico sulla sinistra dell’area, il belga prova il cross in mezzo, cross respinto proprio sui piedi di Dybala che con uno splendido sinistro a giro insacca. E così dopo soli venti minuti, i giallorossi forti della vittoria 1-0 a San Siro ipotecano il passaggio del turno, con il Milan chiamato ora a segnare quattro gol per andare in semifinale. Pochi minuti e la Roma perde Lukaku per un problema muscolare al flessore della coscia destra: il belga viene sostituito da Abraham. Subito dopo aver dovuto fare a meno di Lukaku i giallorossi restano in dieci per il rosso a Celik: il terzino turco in recupero su Leao interviene in scivolata sulla caviglia del portoghese e viene espulso dall’arbitro polacco Marciniak. Il Milan sotto di due gol si ritrova in superiorità numerica e si riversa nell’area romanista sfiorando più volte il gol e vedendosi negare un rigore dal Var. De Rossi corre ai ripari e mette dentro un altro difensore, Llorente al posto di Dybala, mentre Pioli rinforza l’attacco lanciando in campo Jovic al posto di Bennacer. Sono ben sette i minuti di recupero nel primo tempo decisi da Marciniak ma i rossoneri non riescono a bucare la difesa romanista. Mentre le squadre rientrano negli spogliatoi De Rossi aspetta l’arbitro polacco per chiedergli probabilmente spiegazioni sull'espulsione diretta di Celik. Doppia sostituzione per il Milan che prova a giocarsi il tutto per tutto con l’uomo in più nel secondo tempo: entrano Reijnders e Chukwueze, escono Calabria e Loftus Cheek. La squadra di Pioli è costantemente in attacco ma è la Roma a sfiorare il 3-0 prima con una ripartenza di El Shaarawy e poi con una clamorosa palla gol di Abraham a due passi da Maignan. Pioli cambia ancora le sue carte: entrano Florenzi e Okafor, escono Musah e Pulisic, ma il gol per i rossoneri non arriva. Cambia anche De Rossi: fuori Pellegrini, autore di un super salvataggio nel finale di partita, per Renato Sanchez e Bove per Angelino. Nel finale il Milan accorcia con Gabbia, ma la Roma resiste con ordine fino alla fine festeggiando una semifinale strameritata in un Olimpico da impazzire insieme anche a N'Dicka sotto la curva sud dopo la paura di Udine.",
