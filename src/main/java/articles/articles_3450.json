    "title": "Turquie: les sept otages retenus \"pour Gaza\" libérés sains et saufs",
    "text": "Partager:\nUn homme armé prétendant agir \"pour Gaza\" a retenu neuf heures durant jeudi sept employés d'une usine turque du groupe américain Procter & Gamble (P&G), finalement libérés sains et saufs.\nSelon le gouverneur de la province de Kocaeli (nord-ouest) Seddar Yavuz, le preneur d'otages, un ancien employé, a été arrêté sans violence au cours d'une brève opération des forces de l'ordre.\n\"Nos forces de sécurité ont mené leur opération lorsqu'il s'est rendu aux toilettes, sans blesser les otages\", a-t-il expliqué aux journalistes sur place, précisant que l'assaillant ne s'était revendiqué d'aucun groupe politique ou militant.\nIl réclamait la fin des opérations militaires israéliennes à Gaza et l'ouverture du point de passage de Rafah, entre la bande de Gaza et l'Egypte, a précisé le gouverneur.\n[ Les familles réunies aux abords du site ont confirmé à l'AFP que les sept otages, dont une jeune femme de 26 ans, étaient sains et saufs.](../../video/jpg/8b1ebdec-c6b4-45af-9e3f-164319bdd2c8.jpg)\n\"Nous sommes très heureux après ces longues heures d'attente. Dieu merci, ils tous sont sains et saufs\", a confié à l'AFP Fatma Dursun, tante d'un des otages.\nL'homme, qui détenait \"deux armes\" et \"un dispositif\" possiblement explosif, selon le gouverneur, avait fait irruption sur le site vers 14H30 (11H30 GMT).\n- \"qu'il aille se battre là-bas\" -\nSelon une photo diffusée par l'une des otages sur son compte Instagram - vérifié par l'AFP -, il apparaissait le visage partiellement couvert par un keffieh palestinien, portant ce qui pouvait être des explosifs fixés sous la poitrine par du ruban adhésif et un pistolet dans la main droite.\n\"Pour Gaza\", indiquait un message bombé en rouge sur un mur derrière lui, sous deux drapeaux turc et palestinien se faisant face.\n\"S'il fait ça pour la Palestine, qu'il aille se battre là-bas. Qu'est-ce que ma fille de 26 ans a à voir là-dedans?\", s'était insurgée auprès de l'AFP Çigdem Aydemir, la mère de cette jeune employée, entourée de proches anxieux patientant dans la nuit.\n\"Il fait ça supposément pour l'Islam mais ce sont ceux comme lui qui font le plus de mal à l'Islam\", avait aussi réagi Sedat Degirmenci, le beau-père d'un des otages.\nLes familles, tenues à l'écart du site par un cordon policier, se sont plaintes au cours de ces heures d'attente du manque d'information de la part des autorités.\nUn porte-parole du fabricant américain de produits ménagers et d'hygiène Procter & Gamble avait précisé à l'AFP que l'usine de Gebze, à la périphérie est d'Istanbul, avait été \"évacuée plus tôt dans la journée\".\n\"Les travailleurs ont été évacués de l'usine P&G de Gebze; sept ouvriers restent otages\", avait également indiqué le syndicat Umut-Sen dans un message posté sur le réseau social X.\n- soutien américain à Israël -\nLe président turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan, l'un des dirigeants les plus critiques d'Israël depuis le début de la guerre entre Israël et le mouvement islamiste palestinien Hamas, a dénoncé à plusieurs reprises le soutien des Etats-Unis à Israël, qu'il a qualifié d'Etat \"terroriste\" et \"génocidaire\".\nDes appels au boycott de produits américains ont également été très relayés en Turquie depuis le début du conflit. Plusieurs restaurants McDonald's et cafés Starbucks - qui opèrent sous licence turque - ont été vandalisés à travers le pays.\nDébut novembre, la police turque avait dû disperser à l'aide de gaz lacrymogènes un rassemblement pro-palestinien organisé devant une base militaire abritant des forces américaines, quelques heures avant une visite à Ankara du secrétaire d'Etat américain Antony Blinken.\nDes foules de manifestants s'étaient également rassemblées dans les premiers jour du conflit devant l'ambassade des Etats-Unis à Ankara et son consulat à Istanbul.\nDes manifestations de soutien aux Palestiniens sont régulièrement organisées dans le pays.",

    "title": "If You Wanted to See 'The Gentlemen' Season 2 This Year, Netflix Has Bad News",
    "text": "Last year,\nThe Gentlemen made waves on Netflix and was one of the streamer's most popular new hits, but we won't be getting any more of the series this year. Deadline is reporting that fans will need to keep an eye on a spring 2025 Season 2 production start, which will mean a significant wait for more after the March 2024 Season 1 debut, which is down to creator, director and EP Guy Ritchie’s busy schedule. It adds that the series isn't expected to debut on the streamer any earlier than 2026, which is disappointing news for those of us who like gun-toting chickens and drug-dealing Dukes in old money England.\nIn August, Netflix confirmed that the show, which starred\nTheo James and the terrific Kaya Scodelario as two upper crust Brits caught up in a mixture of crime, aristocracy, drug trafficking and murder, would be returning for a second season, saying that they \"are thrilled the series will be returning to Netflix for a second season, and cannot wait to see what happens when the worlds of old money and drug money collide once more.\"\nKaya Scodelario Wanted More 'The Gentlemen'\nLast year, following the conclusion of the first season,\nScodelario said there was nothing concrete in the works as it came to reprising her role as Susie Glass, but did admit she'd want to do something worthwhile, saying, “I don’t know what I’m allowed to say. I will say that Theo and I have discussed it. I think we both would be excited to take these characters on a slightly different journey.”\nShe then added that maintaining the quality of the show was the most important aspect of coming back, as she didn't want to dilute the quality of what came before, which is a perfectly understandable and admirable point to make:\n“I don’t think either of us would want to do a second season if we didn’t feel as though we were doing justice to our characters and taking them on a whole new adventure, something equally as exciting and interesting but even kind of bigger and better. That’s really important to us. If that can happen, great. I think we’d be down.”\nStay tuned for more updates on The Gentlemen Season 2 as it heads into production later this year. You can watch the entirety of the first season now on Netflix, and don't miss\nPerri Nemiroff's full conversation with Scodelario here at Collider.\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Gentlemen\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2025\n- Writers\n-\nGuy Ritchie\nCast\n-\n-\n-\nDaniel Ings",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Where can I order the book in the UK?\nAlongside Amazon, you can order from , and WHSmith.\nIs Comfy available outside of the UK?\nYES! If you are in the US please keep in mind the book is written in Metric and will contain some UK phrases/words you might not be used to (minced beef instead of ground beef, coriander instead of cilantro etc). However, the measurements will easily be converted if you have scales and measuring cups with ml. Having said that I have created a free conversion table with all the conversions and US ingredients that you can print/download if you’d like! If you’re on mobile just click the share/save button then ‘Save To Files’ (here is a black and white version if you’d prefer to not print colour).\nUSA Amazon – Order here (conversions here if needed)\nCanada Amazon – Order here (conversions here if needed)\nAustralia Amazon – Order here\nAustralia other options – Order here\nNew Zealand options – Order here\nMake your comfort food dreams come true with ‘Comfy’\nI’ve poured everything I’ve got into this book and I’m genuinely SO excited to share it with you! It’s built on the back of years of blogging, recipe developing & home cooking and I can safely say it’s my best work to date!!\nComfy is packed with feel-good flavour-loaded dinners that you’ll want to make over and over again. It’s full of the comfiest, most delicious dinners I’ve ever created. Think the ultimate Fish & Chips, Creamy Peppercorn Steak Pasta and Loaded Baked Potato Soup!\nLet me answer some questions!\nI’ll try and preempt some questions, but if you have any more let me know in the comments below!\nHow many of the recipes are new?\nThe majority are completely brand new and written for the cookbook! In fact around 80% of them are completely new, with some of my most popular blog recipes that I had to include.\nWhat kind of recipes are in the book?\nDinners!! All approachable, super-delicious, fail-proof, comfy and full of flavour.\nHere’s a few sneak peek recipes:\n- Burrata Caprese Pasta\n- Cottage Pie Baked Potatoes\n- Easy Bloomer Bread Pizza\n- Brown Butter Gnocchi with Sage and Butternut Squash\n- Soul Soothing Chicken Orzo Soup\n- Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing\n- Harissa Halloumi Skewers\n- Katsu Curry\nAre these year-round recipes or just for ‘comfy’ season?\nThese are 100% recipes you can make all year-round. There’s of course lots of recipes that are perfect to tuck into on a cold Winter’s evening (soups, pies, hearty pastas and warming casseroles). But there’s heaps of Spring/Summery recipes too (think burgers, mega salads, tacos, quick dinners, minimal prep dinners, slow-cooker/no-oven dinners).\nAre the recipes easy to make?\nThe skill level is no different for the recipes I post on here and across social media. As with my blog, I made sure that every single recipe (bar 1 or 2) has a notes section and every recipe is as detailed as possible. My publishers were pulling their hair out squeezing in each recipe, but you know how thorough I like to be . Even the bigger recipes are placed across a double page to ensure there’s no missing crucial info. So, in short, I’ve made the recipes as fail-proof as possible!\nDo let me know if you have any other questions in the comments!\nAlso, if you missed any announcements I made across social media I’ll pop the videos below.\nBook Reveal\nCover Reveal\nSneak Peek\nAs I said, if you’ve got any more questions please do let me know in the comments. But for now, I just want to say the biggest thank you. For the comments, the reviews, the likes – everything. I’m so confident that you’ll love this book and I seriously can’t wait for it to make its way to your kitchen. I know it’ll bring you as much joy as it continues to bring me.\nChris x",

    "text": "The Prairie Lily is part of what makes Saskatoon shine, but it appears to be hitting choppy waters in what could be its final season on the South Saskatchewan River.\nSenior Captain Mike Steckhan said silt and sand buildups have not been washed out naturally for four seasons now, and while he has been able to set sail at low water levels for the last three, he said it’s now impossible to navigate safely this year.\n“We did our survey with our small survey boat and there isn’t enough water at the top of our course to actually turn the ship around,” said Steckhan.\n“Since we haven’t had a flush, now year four, the channel is essentially closed.”\nGet daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

The riverboat has been in conversations with the province’s Water Security Agency (WSA) since July of last summer. Steckhan is calling for water to be released from Lake Diefenbaker to flush out sand from the valley.\nStory continues below advertisement Shawn Jaques, President and CEO of the WSA, said it’s not as simple as opening up the floodgates.\n“Because of the level of the lake, we just don’t have that surplus of water to release, to flush out the system if you will,” Jaques said. “We just don’t have the luxury to have that excess water to be able to do that at this moment.”\nJaques said the last number of years have been drier than normal, with a below average snow pack from the Rocky Mountains. He added the lake is a complex system servicing different users and communities, including roughly 60 per cent of the province’s drinking water.\nThe WSA says it will continue to monitor inflows into Lake Diefenbaker, working with Alberta due to the Rockies acting as the lake’s water source.\nThe agency could not provide a firm timetable as to when or even if water would be released.\nSteckhan said his first voyage of the season was scheduled for Mother’s Day, but instead he says Prairie Lily staff will be contacting ticket holders for refunds, with the rest of the riverboat’s season now hanging in the balance.\n“Because there’s literally not enough water in this valley right now to float this ship, we simply have to cancel our cruises.”\nAdvertisement",

Jonathan Limehouse USA TODAY I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots.\nI am closely monitoring the situation and maintaining regular communication with the @AZSecretary , @RecordersOffice , and local and federal law enforcement. 1/2\n— Mayor Kate Gallego (@MayorGallego) October 24, 2024 A suspect is in custody for allegedly burning 20 electoral ballots that were inside a mailbox in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday morning, the city's mayor and police said.\nDieter Klofkorn, 35, is accused of igniting a fire in a mailbox at a U.S. Postal Office in the area of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road around 1 a.m., Phoenix police said in a news release.\nThe Phoenix Fire Department’s Arson Investigation Taskforce was contacted and assumed the investigation, according to police. The scene was processed, including finding nearby surveillance footage.\nPhoenix Fire Capt. Rob McDade confirmed to NBC News and AZFamily that 20 electoral ballots were damaged, along with additional mail.\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego voiced her concern about this crime on X, saying: \"I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots.\"\n\"I am closely monitoring the situation and maintaining regular communication with the @AZSecretary , @RecordersOffice , and local and federal law enforcement,\" Gallego's post continued. \"There is zero tolerance for criminal activity in our community, and we are working collaboratively with every level of government to bring the perpetrator to justice.\"\nKlofkorn admitted to burning ballots, said actions were not politically motivated\nIn a follow-up X post on Thursday , Gallego announced the arrest of a suspect.\n\"Thanks to swift action by @PhoenixPolice, @PHXFire and federal partners, we have arrested the suspect involved in this incident,\" the mayor's X post reads.\nInvestigators identified Klofkorn after working on several leads, police said. He was eventually found and arrested for an outstanding and unrelated arrest warrant, according to the release. Police did not disclose what the arrest warrant was for.\nWhile in custody, Klofkorn admitted to committing the arson, police said. He went on to tell interviewing officers that he \"wanted to be arrested and that his actions were not politically motivated and not related to anything involving the upcoming election,\" according to the department.\nKlofkorn was subsequently booked into jail on one felony count of arson of property. It is unclear if Klofkorn has an attorney.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "[Andrea Deyrup, MD, PhD](https://pathology.duke.edu/profile/andrea-t-deyrup), has been named to the [Pathologist Magazine’s Power List 2024.](https://thepathologist.com/power-list/2024) The Pathologist solicited nominations of pathologists and laboratory professionals in any stage of their careers who have made accomplishments in the past year in one of the following categories: - Heroes of Pathology – problem-solvers for those in difficulty - Champions for Change – drivers of environmental, social, and governance initiatives - Idols of Innovation – researchers, inventors, and transformers - In the Wings – non-pathologist laboratory medicine professionals - Destined for Excellence – rising stars Deyrup was one of 20 Champions for Change awardees, selected by The Pathologist’s judging panel composed primarily of past Power Listers. Deyrup was recognized for her advocacy work to inspire pathologists to reject race-based medicine and discard outdated beliefs about biological race. In [her award biography](https://thepathologist.com/power-list/2024/champions-for-change/andrea-deyrup) she implores pathologists to commit to science-based data instead of conjecture or prejudice and calls for an honest evaluation of science and the truths it holds. She recognizes as an inspiring leader Joseph L. Graves, Jr., the first African American to earn a PhD in evolutionary biology. “He is one of the most extraordinarily productive scientists I know, and his role as an antiracist leader is readily apparent in his numerous books on the topic,” wrote Deyrup. “But it is not just Dr. Graves’ scholarship that inspires me; it is also his fierce commitment to justice, truth and scientific accuracy. The opportunity to work with and learn from someone who embodies this commitment has helped me reframe my role in this work and urges me to push even harder.” Deyrup is a nationally renowned speaker on the topic of race in medicine. In March 2024, she participated in a panel discussion following a presentation on “Using Race, Ethnicity, and Ancestry as Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research.” It was hosted by Duke’s [Precision Genomics Collaboratory](https://medschool.duke.edu/research/research-initiatives/precision-genomics-collaboratory/people/precision-genomics-0) and [Trinity College of Arts and Sciences](https://trinity.duke.edu/). Leaders were Duke professor [Charmaine Royal, PhD](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/charmaine.royal), and New York University professor [Aravinda Chakravarti, PhD,](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/aravinda-chakravarti) co-chairs of the [2023 National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Report](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new). It emphasized the importance of ensuring that genetics research benefits all groups in society and mitigates harm. A large focus of Deyrup’s work has been to examine the questionable science that supports race-based associations in medical texts and board exams. After finding that the data were often inaccurate and misinterpreted, she has been building connections through presentations and a popular video series to end racialized medicine.
