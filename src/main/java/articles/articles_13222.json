    "title": "Christina Haack's relationship timeline explored after HGTV star claims she keeps getting into relations that \"aren't right\"",
    "text": "Christina Haack has opened up about her pattern of quickly entering new relationships following breakups. In the premiere episode of The Flip Off aired on Wednesday, January 29, 2025, the 41-year-old HGTV star shared an emotional conversation with her first husband, Tarek El Moussa, about her latest split from her third husband, Josh Hall.\nPeople confirmed in January that Haack is currently dating businessman Christopher Larocca, just six months after her separation from Hall in July 2024. During the episode, Haack admitted she has struggled with staying single after a breakup.\n\"I feel like I try to hide and act like I'm not affected but then I just do more stupid things to try to make myself feel better. I just keep doing it and getting into things too fast that I know aren't right,\" she told El Moussa.\nChristina Haack's marital history\nChristina Haack was first married to Tarek El Moussa, whom she met in the early 2000s while working in a California real estate office. The couple, who married in 2009, became household names with their hit HGTV show Flip or Flop. They share two children, Taylor (14) and Brayden (9). Their relationship ended in 2016, and their divorce was finalized in January 2018.\nChristina Haack married Ant Anstead in December 2018, less than a year later. The couple welcomed their son, Hudson, in September 2019, but by September 2020, they announced their separation. Their divorce was finalized in June 2021.\nShortly after, Haack started dating Josh Hall, a real estate agent based in Austin, Texas. They tied the knot in October 2021. However, their marriage lasted less than three years, with Hall filing for divorce in July 2024, citing irreconcilable differences and requesting spousal support.\nIn a confessional segment of The Flip Off, Haack admitted that divorce was never something she envisioned for herself.\n\"I never wanted to get divorced. I'm the only person in my family to ever get a divorce. So I just felt like it's safe to be back in a relationship, but ultimately, that was not safe either,\" she said.\nChristina Haack's latest TV venture, The Flip Off, features her working alongside her ex-husband El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa. The show, first announced in May 2024, was originally set to feature Haack and Hall competing against Tarek and Heather in a house-flipping challenge.\nAfter Haack and Hall split, the show adjusted its format, focusing on Haack's business approach with her \"trusted team.\" According to HGTV, the series will highlight each team's house-flipping skills while also showcasing the dynamic between the stars as they navigate co-parenting. The Flip Off airs on HGTV on Wednesdays at 8 pm ET/PT.\nHaack continues to lead two solo HGTV shows, Christina on the Coast and Christina in the Country. Meanwhile, her new relationship with Larocca has garnered attention, though Haack has yet to address it publicly.",

    "text": "An Israeli strike targeted the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, the Syrian Defense Ministry and state media said, amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas. \"At approximately 23:05 p.m. (20:05 GMT) today, the Israeli enemy carried out airstrikes from the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting targets in the southern region,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement, without reporting casualties.\n\"Our air defense is intercepting hostile targets in the vicinity of Damascus,\" Syria's official SANA news agency wrote earlier. \"An Israeli attack targeted the outskirts of the capital Damascus,\" state television added. Israel rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it would not allow its arch-enemy, Iran, which backs the government of President Bashar al-Assad, to expand its presence there.\nRise in attacks According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes targeted a Syrian air defense position in the southern Sweida area and the vicinity of Damascus International Airport. The attack near the airport came 24 hours after flights resumed, suspended since an Israeli attack in late November just hours after it reopened following similar attacks the previous month, said the London-based NGO, which has a large network of correspondents in Syria.\nIsrael has launched hundreds of airstrikes on its northern neighbor since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011, mostly targeting Iranian-backed forces, including fighters of the Lebanese Ayatollah, as well as Syrian army positions. But it has stepped up its attacks since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7, as tensions rise in the Middle East.",

    "text": "People across the city of Ottawa continue to struggle with the rising cost of groceries, and during this year’s Eid celebrations, many will need help putting food on the table. The city’s only halal food bank is preparing to hand out a record number of Ramadan hampers this weekend. Sadaqa Food Bank has been in the community for nearly two decades, but this year it is on track to set a record for families relying on the service. Thousands of pounds of food were unloaded on Thursday to prepare for the record demand this weekend. \"Pretty close to two tonnes,\" said George Plunkett, who is a driver at the Ottawa Food Bank. \"It includes a whole lot of dry goods, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruit, you name it. They got it here.\" Volunteers are working around the clock to get ready for a rush during the last week of Ramadan and ahead of Eid celebrations. \"Yes, there is more of a need because we pack extra packages for, you know, for the Ramadan,\" said Bibi Najerally, who is a supervisor at the Sadaqa Food Bank. \"This has included rice, flour, sugar, oil dates. This is a special time for dates for us, you know, because we start and break our fast with the dates.” Anyone is welcome to access the service. In recent years, there has been an unprecedented demand at Sadaqa Food Bank. \"When I started here, like, you know, two years ago, there was a maximum of 50 on a Saturday and Sunday, but now we are surpassing 80 families in the weekend per day,\" said Nancie Barhoumi, who is a volunteer at the food bank. People of all ages and backgrounds line up for food on Saturday and Sunday at the location in Nepean. \"Students, newcomers; you know, with the high cost of living, you know, it is very high,\" said Najerally. \"I mean, the food that we are giving them, it's only like for five days. So they come at least once per month.\" For those struggling to put food on the table, many thankful for this community resource at a time of need. Sadaqa Food Bank is only open on the weekend and the food packages meet specific Muslim requirements. Volunteers say people can register for a pick up on either Saturday or Sunday.

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "text": "¿Cómo proteger a tu perro del frío? Esto recomienda Protección Civil de Nuevo LeónLas autoridades pide mantener a los 'lomitos' a salvo para evitar enfermedades [Jorge Narváez](https://www.reporteindigo.com/author/jorge-narvaez/) Durante estos días de mucho frío es importante que resguardes a tus [mascotas](https://www.reporteindigo.com/piensa/los-perros-deben-dormir-afuera-durante-el-invierno-esto-dicen-los-expertos/) al interior de la casa, pero además que supervises el lugar que le destines para evitar enfermedades y que el animal sufra por las bajas temperaturas. Para que no seas parte del maltrato animal, Protección Civil de Nuevo León emitió algunas [recomendaciones](https://www.reporteindigo.com/piensa/alimentos-que-nunca-debes-darle-a-tu-perro-si-quieres-que-viva-muchos-anos/) que son clave para que tu perro pueda estar cálido en tiempos de invierno. Que tu mascota no pase frío [Concientizar](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/nuevo-leon-se-convierte-en-pet-friendly-permiten-a-empleados-llevar-a-sus-mascotas-al-trabajo/): el perro siente el mismo frío que los seres humanos, por tal motivo trátalo como parte de tu familia. - Lugar: evita tener a tu mascota en las azoteas, pues aunque tenga un techo para refugiarse las corrientes del viento lo pueden afectar. [Supervisión](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/regio-rescata-a-perrita-ciega-que-dejaron-abandonada/): revisa constantemente las condiciones del hogar para que no se presenten sitios húmedos y que le puedan afectar al animal. - Necesidades: cuida los cambios de temperatura en caso de sacarlo al exterior para que deseque u orine. - Afectaciones: no automedicar a los perros y mucho menos proporcionarle pastillas de consumo humano, pues algunas de ellas suelen ser toxicas para los animales. Ver esta publicación en Instagram El comandante Jesús Lara, encargado de la Unidad de Búsqueda y Localización de Protección Civil de Nuevo León, explicó que es importante no sacar a los perros a pasear muy temprano o muy noche, debido a las condiciones del pavimento frío y mojado. En tanto que el médico veterinario Eduardo Martínez aprobó que las personas protejan a sus mascotas con alguna prenda o suéter para los animales, pero pidió tener algunas precauciones. “Ahí mucho cuidado con el tema del abrigo está perfecto pero cuidar que no se humedezca porque si ese sueter o ese abrigo se humedece va hacer peor, entonces hay que mantener secos a nuestros animales para que en este momento no nos complique los vientos”, dijo.",
