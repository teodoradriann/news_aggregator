    "title": "No Malice Proclaims This Kendrick Lamar Diss Track As His \"Favorite Song\" Right Now",
    "text": "Clipse has the whole world waiting for their upcoming album Let God Sort Em Out, but they are in no rush to drop it. While that frustrates some fans, it also shows that Pusha T and No Malice are confident in what they have. They recently spoke to The People's Gallery at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday night (January 21), going over their favorite places to eat in the city, their style tips, Pharrell's collaborations with them and Louis Vuitton, and their favorite songs at the moment. No Malice thought about it for a while when he heard the question, and landed on a very common but nonetheless understandable answer: Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" diss track.\nOf course, this shouldn't really surprise anyone given how No Malice's brother and Clipse partner Pusha T has not only collaborated with Kendrick Lamar in the past, but also beefed with Drake. In fact, we can't help but think that perhaps No Malice heard about Drizzy's UMG lawsuit over the song and wants to keep it in rotation.\nNo Malice Calls Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" His Favorite Song Right Now\nFurthermore, this answer also excited fans who heard some recent rumors that Kendrick Lamar will appear on this upcoming Clipse album, Let God Sort Em Out. The speculations stems from a copyright claim that allegedly landed on a TikToker's video, which claims that it used audio from a track called \"Chains & Whips\" from Pusha T, No Malice, and K.Dot. This would mean that this hypothetical dream collab for fans is something that the duo already teased during Pharrell's debut Louis Vuitton fashion show in 2023, which is where the audio in question comes from.\nRegardless of the timeline, that remains pure rumor and speculation, so don't bet on anything when it comes to Let God Sort Em Out except when it comes to its surefire quality. Whether this Clipse project will host a couple of verses from Pusha T, No Malice, and Kendrick Lamar is a mystery we can't wait to unveil, even if we got our hopes up. We know the album is done, and we imagine that \"Not Like Us\" provided some compelling inspiration for it if it lined up with recording sessions.",

L'information, rapportée par De Standaard, a été confirmée par Herwig Van Doorsselaer, du syndicat socialiste Setca.\n- Publié le 28-03-2025 à 11h46\nLes syndicats continuent de s'opposer au projet de la direction qui prévoit de transférer quelque 580 employés du service clientèle vers la société externe Accenture. Ils exigent l'abandon de ce projet, alors que le CEO, Michael Anseeuw, a affirmé son intention de le poursuivre plus tôt ce mois-ci. Il a invoqué une convention collective de travail garantissant les droits des employés en cas de transfert.\nAprès plusieurs semaines de menaces, les syndicats ont donc décidé de passer à l'action jeudi prochain. L'appel à la grève concerne l'ensemble du personnel, mais Van Doorsselaer ne prévoit pas d'impact sur l'activité des agences bancaires. Le mouvement social devrait principalement concerner le siège social bruxellois et les bureaux d'Anvers, Gand, Louvain, Charleroi et Liège, où travaillent les employés concernés.",

    "text": "Baltimore Archdiocese finalizes plan to cut parishes and worship sites The Baltimore Archdiocese will close a majority of its parishes and cut its worship sites in half as part of cost-cutting measures, known as the Church’s “Seek the City” plan. Archbishop William Lori formally sanctioned the plan Wednesday. The number of parishes in Baltimore city and county will drop from 61 to 23. The number of worship sites will drop from 59 to 30. “This process was aimed at allowing our parishes to focus on mission and ministry, as opposed to leaking roofs, crumbling walls, and failing electrical and plumbing systems,” Lori said in a [video](https://www.archbalt.org/seek-the-city-final-plan/). The Church held a handful of listening sessions in April after revealing a draft plan to consolidate its parishes and sites. The original plan cut the number of parishes to 21 and worship sites to 26. Other archdiocese across the nation have made similar moves. Boston and Seattle consolidated their parishes after the pandemic hurt attendance numbers. Those archdioceses also paid out substantial sums to survivors of sexual abuse, a financial hit that further necessitated the changes. The Baltimore Archdiocese is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings due to the anticipated costs of compensating hundreds of sexual abuse survivors after Maryland passed a law extending the time in which survivors of child sex abuse are able to file claims. The Church was considering consolidating long before it filed for bankruptcy. The plan has been in the works for about two years, according to the Archdiocese. However, the archdiocese admitted that the legal challenges would be a large drain on its resources. “Chapter 11 reorganization is the best path forward to compensate equitably all victim-survivors, given the Archdiocese’s limited financial resources, which would have otherwise been exhausted on litigation,” Baltimore Archbishop William Lori said in an open [letter](https://www.archbalt.org/archbishop-loris-message-on-chapter-11/) to his congregation. “Staggering legal fees and large settlements or jury awards for a few victim-survivors would have depleted our financial resources, leaving the vast majority of victim-survivors without compensation, while ending ministries that families across Maryland rely on for material and spiritual support.” Filings show that the archdiocese was retaining lawyers and consultants that likely advised the Church on how it should move forward with the abuse cases. The filings show the Church paid more than a quarter of a million dollars for legal advice on bankruptcy. The filings also show the organization has more than $200 million in assets, which include a Tiffany tea set, a diamond-encrusted crucifix, a sapphire-studded locket and dozens of solid gold rings.",
