    "text": "Staff Writers from News.com.au March 15th, 2024 10:04 am Gun fullbacks Reece Walsh and Latrell Mitchell stole the show on Thursday night with Walsh tearing the Rabbitohs to pieces in Brisbane’s 28-18 win at Suncorp Stadium.\nThe star No.1s shared a heartwarming moment in the final minute of the game where the exhausted players embraced while lying on the ground after Mitchell scored the final try of the game.\nWatch every game of every round this NRL Telstra Premiership Season LIVE with no ad-breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today >\nMitchell slipped inside the tired Broncos’ defensive line and shrugged off Billy Walters before the Rabbitohs star left Walsh wrong-footed and he had enough speed to reach the line from there.\nRound 2 NRL Mar 14 8:00pm AEST FT Broncos 28 Rabbitohs 18 MATCH CENTRE *Odds are current as of 15th March 2024, 10:44am 44am AEST VIEW ALL SCORES NRL Mar 15 8:00pm AEST Panthers Eels MATCH CENTRE $1.40 $3.00 *Odds are current as of 15th March 2024, 10:44am 44am 44am 44am 44am 44am AEST VIEW ALL SCORES CHANCES ARE YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE. Set a deposit limit. Walsh didn’t give up on the play and almost caught Mitchell as he made a tackle on the try line.\nThe momentum of Walsh’s tackle saw Mitchell roll on top of him after putting the ball down.\nIt was then that the pair shared a quick word before Walsh pulled Mitchell into him for a cheeky hug. Mitchell responded by burying his face into Mitchell’s neck with one of his hands trapped under Walsh’s head.\nIt's amazing Reece Walsh didn't present with hickies after this tender moment. Photo: NRL, Fox League. Source: FOX SPORTS\nIt got even cuter when both players went down with simultaneous leg cramps and needed to be helped back to their feet.\nWalsh laughed about it after the match.\n“I was sitting down watching his highlights as a kid, I was a little starstruck on the field at the end there — didn’t know if I should let him run or tackle him,” Walsh told ABC.\nThe moment wasn’t missed by Fox League and Channel 9 commentators.\nFatty Vautin said Walsh was “bamboozled” when Mitchell turned him inside out.\nFox League’s Michael Ennis said: “We came into the game just wanting to see these two come together. We didn’t expect it would be a moment where they’re lying there with cramp with 30 seconds to go.\nReece Walsh gave just as good as he got. Photo: Fox League. Source: Supplied\n“They have been the stars tonight.”\nIt was Walsh particularly that looked a class above.\nIn his third season in the top grade, it’s hard to remember Walsh is still only 21.\nThe electric fullback, donning his bright pink boots, stepped up against the Rabbitohs, scoring two brilliant tries and looking a threat any time he touched the ball.\nWhile there are still plenty of questions about Walsh’s defence, there is no doubting his work in attack.\nWalsh was at his electrifying best against the Rabbitohs.\nThe 21-year-old scored a try in each half, both certain to make highlight reels.\nReece Walsh and Latrell Mitchell could barely move. Photo: Fox League. Source: Supplied\nWith 15 minutes left in the first half, Walsh caught the ball first off the play-the-ball on the right but ran straight back to the right, running around the middle defence, palming off Cameron Murray and going straight past Latrell to score under the posts.\n“Reece Walsh, creating something out of nothing — and his something is always very very good,” Warren Smith said in Fox League commentary.\nMichael Ennis said: “It’s genius. Absolute genius. And he’s the reason there’s 40,000 there tonight.”\nOn Channel 9, Vautin called Walsh an “Olympic-class” star after the try.\nAlthough Latrell ran 18 times for 171m compared to Walsh’s 15 runs for 126m, the Broncos fullback made the most of the chances he had.",

    "text": "Kirk Cameron dissected what he called the problems with “tolerance” culture and said he sees so many people who are “just tolerating evil.”\nDuring the 53-year-old actor’s appearance on Tim Pool’s\npodcast “Timcast IRL” on Thursday, Cameron and the hosts talked about how Christians are a tolerant group compared to the woke left.\n“My understanding of people who are being tolerant and turning the other cheek, I see so many who are just tolerating evil,” Cameron told the hosts. “And that’s not loving your neighbor.”\n“I mean at the end of the day the two great commandments of Christianity are to love God with all of your heart, mind, soul, and strength,” he added. “And the second is to love your neighbor like yourself. If you tolerate the kinds of things that bring misery to your neighbors, and ultimately strip them of their liberties, you’re not loving them.”\nTruly wild that this guy played the main character in the Left Behind movie. Love seeing him on\n[@Timcast]. [pic.twitter.com/wXp2dAeq9f]\n— J. Chase Davis (@jchasedavis)\n[February 23, 2024]\nThe “Growing Pains” star said if someone were to cuss him out and steal his jacket, he might still love them. However, when it comes to targeting his children or his liberties, that’s another issue. “Or you make my neighbors live in poverty and misery so that you can go live on Epstein island, no I think we shouldn’t tolerate that,” Cameron said.\nEarlier in the show, the hosts talked to the actor about his efforts last year to read his faith-based children’s book “\nAs You Grow” at public libraries that had hosted Drag Queen Story Hours. Cameron previously spoke about his reading project with the Daily Wire.\nCameron said he was denied the opportunity to read his book about the values of faith at more than 50 libraries across the country.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\nPublished by Brave Books, Cameron’s book contains messages about “peace, love, joy, and kindness,” and “growing in wisdom through the seasons of life.”\nHe said he made it because the “education of children is of primary importance” given how young children are being indoctrinated with things like gender ideology at a young age. He added that his book is “Pro-God and pro-family and Biblical values.”\nRelated:\nKirk Cameron Talks Conservatives, Christians Wading Into Culture Battle Ahead Of National Faith-Based Story Hour Event",
