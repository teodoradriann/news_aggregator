    "text": "In response to the devastating flash flooding in central Texas, many are looking for ways to get and give help. And scammers are looking to prey on people’s generosity. So how can you make sure your donations go to the people who need them and not to a scammer?\n- Donate to charities you know and trust with a proven track record of dealing with disasters.\n- Before you give, research the charity yourself — especially if the donation request comes on social media. Check out the charity on the Better Business Bureau’s\nGive.org, orCharity Watch. Find out exactly how much of your donation will go directly to the people the charity says it helps. - Don’t donate to anyone who insists you must pay by cash, gift card, wiring money, or cryptocurrency. That’s how scammers tell you to pay. If you decide to donate, paying by credit card gives you more protections.\n- Be cautious about giving to individuals on\ncrowdfunding sites. Know that money raised in a crowdfunding campaign goes to the campaign organizer, not directly to the people or cause it’s set up to help. Review the platform’s policies — does it take measures to verify postings that ask for help after a disaster? And know that donating via crowdfunding is not tax deductible. - Confirm the number before you text to donate. If someone asks you to donate by text, call the number on the charity’s website to confirm you have the right number to donate by text.\nTo learn more about how to donate safely, go to ftc.gov/charity.

    "text": "Perfect sunset conditions expected for Southcentral ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - If you’re in the southcentral region this week, the weather will provide some perfect picture opportunities for sunsets as blue sky and sunshine will dominate during the day. High pressure is building, and the region is expected to see clear skies for most of the workweek. Unfortunately, the temperatures will also be taking a plunge, so dress warmly if you’re going to be out and about. Overnight they will be falling into the single digits with teens for daytime highs. As the southcentral region basks in winter sunshine, the rest of Alaska will see some very active weather. A Blizzard Warning is in effect from Point Hope to Point Lay and Utiagvik until Monday morning. Snow and blowing snow are expected with wind gusts to 65 mph. There’s also a Winter Storm Warning from 6 a.m. Monday into Tuesday morning from the south slopes of the western Brooks Range, Noatak Valley, Seward Peninsula, Upper Kobuk Valleys and Lower Koyukuk and Yukon Valleys inward to Galena. Heavy snow and gusty winds to 45 mph are expected. In the Southeast, Juneau and the surrounding inner channels are under a Winter Storm Warning until 9 p.m. Monday. Heavy snow with a storm total of 25 inches is expected. Other areas likely to see active weather in the form of snow include the Interior, and the lower Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta where mild temperatures are likely to produce snow and freezing rain.

    "title": "Korean Peninsula On The Brink: A High-Stakes Game For Peace – Analysis",
    "text": "The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most volatile regions in the world, with the potential for conflict ever-present due to the unresolved tensions between North and South Korea.\nThe recent deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers by North Korea along its southern border represents a significant escalation in military posture, heightening the risk of conflict and threatening regional stability. This development necessitates a multifaceted approach that goes beyond traditional military deterrence. A comprehensive strategy that includes diplomatic mediation, promotion of Korean reunification, and gradual withdrawal of external powers could pave the way for lasting peace on the Peninsula.\nIn this context, countries like Indonesia and Mongolia, known for their neutral stances and diplomatic acumen, could serve as facilitators, fostering dialogue and de-escalation between the two Koreas. This essay argues that by leveraging neutral mediators like Indonesia and Mongolia, initiating steps towards reunification, and advocating for the withdrawal of the four major powers, sustainable peace can be achieved on the Korean Peninsula.\nNorth Korea’s recent military buildup is concerning not only due to the significant number of missile launchers but also because of the strategic implications it carries. The deployment is a clear indication of Pyongyang’s intention to strengthen its deterrence capabilities and assert its influence over the region. The locations of these missile launchers, likely positioned to cover key South Korean targets, emphasize the regime’s willingness to project power and maintain an aggressive stance. The threat posed by these missile systems extends beyond the immediate vicinity and includes the broader region, such as Japan and even U.S. territories in the Pacific. Additionally, the presence of these launchers raises the risk of miscalculation, where a minor incident could rapidly escalate into a large-scale conflict, involving regional and global powers.\nTo address this escalation, the role of a neutral facilitator is crucial. In particular, Indonesia and Mongolia stand out as potential mediators. Indonesia’s history of non-alignment and its leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement position it as a credible and impartial actor on the global stage. Moreover, Indonesia’s active involvement in ASEAN and its diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea make it a suitable candidate to facilitate dialogue. Indonesia has consistently advocated for peace and stability in the region, and its participation could provide a fresh perspective that emphasizes regional solutions to regional problems. Mongolia has a unique role to play in mediating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to its geographical location between Russia and China. Unlike the major powers involved, Mongolia has chosen a policy of neutrality and has actively hosted peace dialogues, such as the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue focused on Northeast Asian security. Given its historical ties with both Koreas and its balanced foreign policy, Mongolia is seen as a trustworthy intermediary capable of bringing the parties to the negotiating table. One of the advantages of engaging in dialogue in Mongolia is that it provides a less pressured environment, free from the heavy influences of larger powers, which creates a unique opportunity for constructive and meaningful discussions between the Two Koreas.\nWhile neutrality and mediation are crucial in de-escalating tensions, the ultimate solution to the Korean conflict lies in the reunification of the peninsula. The division of Korea is a remnant of Cold War politics, and reunification holds the potential to not only restore historical unity but also bring significant economic, social, and security benefits. A unified Korea could leverage the collective resources and strengths of both North and South, transforming into a regional economic powerhouse. Additionally, reunification could address the dire humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where millions suffer from poverty and repression under a controlling regime. However, the process of reunification is complex and must be carefully planned and executed. Initially, efforts should prioritize building trust through economic cooperation, such as joint industrial projects and infrastructure development, which can create interdependence and reduce the likelihood of conflict. Cultural exchanges and family reunions should also be emphasized to foster human connections and rebuild the torn social fabric resulting from decades of division. Over time, these initiatives can pave the way for more substantial political integration, leading to eventual unification under a single government that represents the interests of all Koreans.\nOne of the main obstacles to reunification and long-term peace is the presence and influence of the four major powers: the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. Each of these countries holds strategic interests in the Korean Peninsula, further complicating the situation. The United States maintains a significant military presence in South Korea, primarily to deter North Korean aggression but also to project power in the Asia-Pacific region. China, while officially endorsing a stable and denuclearized Korean Peninsula, perceives North Korea as a buffer state against U.S. influence in East Asia. Russia and Japan also have their strategic calculations that often conflict with the pursuit of peace and reunification. To achieve lasting peace, it is crucial to gradually diminish the military presence and impact of external powers. This entails a phased disengagement rather than an abrupt withdrawal to prevent destabilization in the region. Moreover, strong international assurances for the security of a unified Korea should accompany this process. The United Nations can play a critical role by overseeing the disengagement and ensuring that both North and South Korea feel sufficiently secure to pursue reunification without external intervention. Additionally, the establishment of a multilateral security framework involving regional stakeholders, including ASEAN, could provide a platform for ongoing dialogue and the prevention of conflicts.\nDespite the challenges involved, attaining peace on the Korean Peninsula is not only desirable but also achievable through a combination of diplomacy, regional cooperation, and international support. Indonesia and Mongolia, as impartial actors, can play a pivotal role in bridging the divide between North and South Korea. Their involvement can facilitate dialogue and build trust. The gradual reunification of Korea, coupled with the withdrawal of external powers, lays the groundwork for a stable and prosperous Korean Peninsula that can contribute to broader regional security.\nIn conclusion, the recent escalation by North Korea highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive and innovative approach to peace on the Korean Peninsula. By engaging neutral mediators such as Indonesia and Mongolia, advocating for steps towards reunification, and promoting the gradual withdrawal of the four major powers, the groundwork for sustainable peace can be established. Undoubtedly, the process will be intricate and filled with challenges, but the potential rewards—a peaceful unified Korea and a stable Northeast Asia are well worth the endeavour.\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.\nBibliography\nCumings, Bruce.

    "text": "Roma, 28 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) – El Papa ha denunciado este jueves las «matanzas de inocentes en el mundo», en un mensaje en la red social X (antes Twitter), donde también ha criticado las «masacres debidas a las armas». «Cuántas matanzas de inocentes en el mundo: en el vientre materno, en las rutas de los desesperados que buscan esperanza, en las vidas de tantos niños cuya infancia está devastada por la guerra. Estos niños son los pequeños Jesús de hoy», ha expresado. Asimismo, ha recalcado que, actualmente, «como en el tiempo de Herodes, las intrigas del mal, que se oponen a la luz divina, se mueven a la sombra de la hipocresía y del ocultamiento». «¡Cuántas masacres debidas a las armas ocurren en un silencio ensordecedor, a escondidas de todos!», ha lamentado. Según señala ‘Vatican News’, el Papa ha pronunciado en varias ocasiones las palabras «masacre de los inocentes», en recuerdo a las víctimas de los conflictos en curso, en Ucrania, Siria, Yemen, Armenia, Azerbaiyán, Sudán, Congo y, en particular, de la guerra que tiene lugar en Gaza. Así, en su mensaje Urbi et Orbi, hizo un llamamiento para poner fin a la actual carrera armamentística. «La gente, que no quiere armas sino pan, que lucha por salir adelante y pide la paz -dijo-, ignora cuánto dinero público se gasta en armamento. Sin embargo, ¡deberían saberlo! Que se hable de ello, que se escriba, para que se conozcan los intereses y las ganancias que mueven los hilos de las guerras», señaló.",

    "text": "by Steve Harrison There are caustic people in this world. Sometimes we find that we are related to them. Sometimes it’s a friend who changes, maybe due to some very difficult life event. Sometimes they sit across from us at the conference table at work or school. Their bitterness is insidious and cancerous. It’s not easy to distance oneself from these people. We are taught to make the best of bad situations and look for the best in people. We want to go high when others go low. It’s what our parents and churches teach us to do. But when is it time to cut someone out of our lives, to distance ourselves far from a malignant influence. I’ve done it a few times in my life, and though ultimately it has been for the best, I cannot say it doesn’t hurt, sometimes even many years after the separation. I guess I can say that I’m lucky that the people I have had to distance myself from have been friends, not family. Chosen affiliations and not compulsory ones. In either case, is moving on from someone or a situation seen as growth or failure? I’m sure it can be both. Tough love requires toughness, sometimes more than we think we have. As I was watching both political conventions, I was thinking how hard it must be for someone to leave the party they had found a safe haven in, a group of like-minded souls, a familiar reflection. But change occurs, in churches, with friends, in governments, and in cultures. Rules change. We may try to adapt but the struggle is too much. We must either tune out or drop out. Neither is easy. It takes courage to step away. I was accused in a Courier letter to the editor not long ago of living in the sad world that liberals create. I doubt the writer tuned in to last week’s Democratic National Convention. It was anything but sad. I’ve never really been a political person; I’m not sure I have ever watched conventions for more than 10 minutes at a time, but I did this year. I found the contrast between the two striking. The energy, the expressions, the message, each an interesting juxtaposition. The effect on my mood was equally different. Give me hope. Give me poetry. Give me history. Give me celebration. As Tim Waltz said during his acceptance speech, it’s time to turn the page. It applies to politics, and it applies to life. When something isn’t working any longer, when the joy derived from a job, a friendship, or a belief system no longer exists, it is time to turn the page.",

    "text": "Archivo - Handling en Barajas. EUROPA PRESS - Archivo MADRID, 29 (EUROPA PRESS)\nSouth Europe Ground Services, la filial de handling del grupo IAG, ha firmado este jueves el acta final de la negociación para su expediente de regulación de empleo (ERE) y tendrá abierto el plazo de adhesión voluntaria entre el 11 y el 27 de diciembre, con la intención de resolverlo para unas 1.500 personas.\nLa compañía ha dado por finalizado ya el proceso de consultas con los representantes de los trabajadores de todos sus centros de trabajo tras alcanzar un acuerdo mayoritario.\nDentro del acuerdo, los trabajadores indefinidos o en excedencia con reserva de puesto de trabajado que cumplan 60 o más años desde el inicio del ERE, que finalizará el 31 de diciembre de 2026, podrán acogerse a la prejubilación con un porcentaje garantizado acordado del 50% del salario regulador, es decir, la percepción bruta anual correspondiente a los doce meses previos.\nEstos trabajadores mantendrán el derecho a utilizar billetes 'free', lo que supone que pueden volar de manera gratuita en las aerolíneas del grupo, según el acuerdo alcanzado el pasado 2 de febrero.\nAsimismo, podrá acogerse al ERE cualquier trabajador indefinido aunque no cumpla los requisitos para solicitar la modalidad de prejubilación.\nPara quienes opten por acogerse de manera voluntaria, las condiciones pactadas son la indemnización por importe de 21 días por año de servicio, con un máximo de doce mensualidades.\nEl consejero delegado de South, Miguel Ángel Gimeno, ha señalado que el acuerdo es una noticia \"muy positiva\", ya que \"garantiza el futuro sostenible\" de la compañía.\nSouth es la filial de handling del Grupo IAG que opera en 38 aeropuertos nacionales. Presta servicio de handling para las compañías del grupo IAG y a otras terceras compañías.\nLa compañía fue inscrita en el Registro Mercantil el pasado 19 de febrero después de que Iberia Airport Services perdiera la licencia de operador de 'handling' en ocho grandes aeropuertos (Barcelona-El Prat, Palma de Mallorca, Málaga, Alicante, Gran Canaria, Tenerife Sur, Ibiza y Bilbao) en el último concurso de Aena, resuelto en septiembre de 2023.\nComo consecuencia, se inició un conflicto social porque los sindicatos temían una pérdida en la calidad de sus condiciones laborales que acabó a principios del pasado febrero, tras varias convocatorias de huelga, con un acuerdo para la constitución de esta nueva empresa y el proyecto de un ERE voluntario.",
