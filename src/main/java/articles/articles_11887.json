    "text": "Linea ferroviaria del San Gottardo presa di mira dalle valanghe La interruzione del servizio ferroviario Il maltempo ha continuato ad imperversare oltre Gottardo anche nella giornata di ieri. Neve, pioggia, valanghe sono segnalate in tutta la regione delle Alpi. Le valanghe hanno preso quest’anno di mira la linea del Gottardo; il servizio ha dovuto essere più volte interrotto per la caduta di valanghe lungo la linea. Nel pomeriggio di ieri una grossa valanga cadde sulla linea fra Amsteg ed Erstfeld. Il traffico ferroviario rimase interrotto per alcune ore. Il diretto che doveva arrivare ieri sera alle 18,38 giunse solo verso le nove (nota di 100 anni dopo: alla stazione di Lugano); analoghi ritardi subirono gli altri treni. Questa notte una più grossa e più disastrosa valanga è caduta nelle vicinanze di Wassen, nella località Rohrbach; la valanga, di proporzioni gravissime, ha prodotto seri danni alla linea. Il traffico ferroviario rimase così interrotto. Il diretto che doveva arrivare a Lugano stamane alle 3 è rimasto bloccato alla stazione di Erstfeld; il diretto ascendente che parte dalla nostra stazione alle 12,30 è stato trattenuto a Bellinzona. La interruzione della linea durerà tutta la giornata. Colla mattinata ha incominciato a funzionare il servizio dei trasbordi. Il servizio dei treni locali si svolge normalmente. Alle undici e mezzo di stamane il diretto delle tre di stamane non era ancora giunto a Lugano. L’ufficio del Capostazione ci comunica che i diretti per il Gottardo partono in orario, solo che fra Gurtnellen e Wassen si deve effettuare un trasbordo per un percorso a piedi di circa mezz’ora. I treni diretti d’oltre Gottardo non hanno, si capisce, orario di arrivo. Si spera di poter rimettere ancora nella serata di oggi la linea in istato di servizio. Una valanga ad Airolo Airolo, 29 – Ieri sera, poco dopo le dieci, preceduta da un rombo pauroso, precipitava nel mezzo del paese, nella località Valascia, al di sopra dell’Hotel Motta, una grossa valanga che scoperchiava il tetto della casa del sig. Luigi Motta, travolgeva una stalla con tre cavalli ed altre piccole stalle. I danni materiali sono ingenti, per fortuna non ci sono vittime umane. Mancano completamente notizie dalla Valle Bedretto. Al laghetto di Muzzano Un lettore del giornale ci segnala stamane il fatto che al laghetto di Muzzano, gelato recentemente e quindi adatto alle manifestazioni di pattinaggio, manca qualsiasi sorveglianza da parte delle autorità, e per disciplinare l’accesso del pubblico sul ghiaccio e per intervenire in caso di eventuali disgrazie. Giustamente osserva il nostro cortese informatore come il lago di Muzzano abbia già causato diverse vittime e che sarebbe necessario l’intervento delle autorità per delimitare innanzitutto la zona che meglio si presta per le corse dei pattinatori.

    "text": "NASA Making History With Solar Probe Practically Touching The Sun\nNASA’s Parker Solar Probe is set to make an incredibly fast, unprecedentedly close trip past the Sun late this year. On December 24, 2024, the space vessel is scheduled to zip past our Sun as fast as 195 km/s (435,000 mph) at a distance of only 6.1 million km (3.8 million miles) from the solar surface. It will be the fastest any human-made object has ever traveled and the closest any such object has gotten to the Sun.\nNASA’s Parker Probe Set To Make History As Closest Object To The Sun\nThe solar probe will be, in the words of Dr. Nour Raouafi, a scientist on The Parker project, “basically almost landing on a star.” For context, our planet orbits at an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million km), meaning the probe will be about 96 percent closer to the Sun than we are. Raouafi says the mission will be as significant an achievement for humankind as the 1969 Moon landing.\nThe Probe Will Travel Incredibly Fast\nThe speed of the Parker Solar Probe will be due to the gravitational forces working on it as it falls toward the Sun, reaching a velocity that could take it from New York to London in less than half a minute. The Parker project began in 2018 with the goal of making several passes near the Sun, with each one growing closer than the one before.\nThis incredible challenge faces multiple potential complications, including heat, as the temperature of the spacecraft’s front will likely approach 1,400°C, or 2552°F.\nThe plan for the solar probe is to make its measurements as quickly as possible, making a fast entry and a fast retreat. Readings will be taken by several instruments, which will be protected by a substantial heat shield. Researchers hope this data will provide new insight into some of the Sun’s important processes, including giving scientists a better understanding of the Sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere.\nThe Sun’s Corona\nNASA scientists are hopeful that the solar probe will help them understand why the corona superheats in ways that are counter to what would be anticipated. The photosphere, or surface, of the Sun has a temperature of approximately 6,000°C (10,832°F), but its corona can reach temperatures exceeding 1,000,000°C, or 1,800,032°F. This phenomenon occurs in spite of the logical assumption that temperatures farther from the nuclear core of the Sun would be lower than temperatures closer to the core.\nBetter Space Weather Predictions\nThe solar probe will also be looking at heavy ions, protons, and electrons that flow outward from the Sun and accelerate to supersonic speeds in the corona, creating a wind of 400 km/s, or 1,000,000 mph. This too has been a mystery, but understanding this aspect of the Sun’s behavior is important for improving predictions of solar activity and what is referred to as “space weather.” This weather—strong bursts of magnetic fields and particles from the Sun—can have a detrimental effect on communications and power grids on our planet, while also posing the risk of radiation exposure to our astronauts.\nUnraveling The Mysteries Of Our Sun\nThe findings of the solar probe will affect future missions to the Moon as well as potential permanent lunar facilities. Having already made a close flyby of the sun on Friday, the probe will pass by three more times before it makes a trip around Venus to accelerate into its final trip. Scientists with the Parker project are hopeful that the information gained from this unprecedented mission will benefit our understanding of our solar system for generations to come.\nSource:\nBBC",

    "title": "Huge surf pounds West Coast and Hawaii, flooding some low-lying areas",
    "text": "Los Angeles — Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding. Forecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach.\nA high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet (8.5 to 10 meters) and up to 40 feet (12 meters) at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas.\nIn Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate.\n“Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. \"I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.”\nThe same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers.\n“I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident.\nWhile not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn't resist.\nPatience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast.\n“I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they're kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.”\nIn Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet (5.5 to 6.7 meters) along west-facing shores of five islands.\nProfessional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side.\nPaishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning.\n“It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said.\nHe warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.”\nHonolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said.\n“This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said.\nThe dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.\n___\nJennifer Sinco Kelleher reported from Honolulu.",

    "text": "[NHL](../) Germany Suffers First Defeat at 2024 WJC in Loss to Sweden After a [historic 4-3 win over Team Finland](//www.iihf.com/en/events/2024/wm20/gamecenter/playbyplay/42158/6-fin-vs-ger) on Dec. 27, Team Germany played host nation Team Sweden in their second game of the 2024 IIHF World Junior Championship (WJC) on Thursday, Dec. 28. Germany stayed in the game for most of it, but a dominant third period by Sweden gave the Germans a huge loss, as it ended 5-0. Germany Lost in a Close Game Coming off beating Finland for the first time at the WJC, there was a chance that Germany could come out slow in the second game in back-to-back days. However, with the help of netminder [Matthias Bittner](//www.eliteprospects.com/player/580513/matthias-bittner), Germany proved that yesterday was not a fluke despite the loss. Even after giving up 18 shots to Sweden compared to their six in the first period, there seemed to be a chance for Germany to get the equalizer. Related: [2024 Guide to the World Junior Championship](//thehockeywriters.com/2024-world-junior-championship-guide/) Otto Stenberg scored the lone goal for Sweden in the first period to give the hosts a lead at the 15:28 mark. That should be a good sign for the Germans; holding off the Swedes for that long shows that they played strong defensively for the first 20 minutes of the game. The second period seemed to be better for Germany, as they held Sweden to seven shots compared to their six, like in the first period. To be able to lessen Sweden’s chances seemed to give Germany more confidence as the game went on. [Julian Lutz](//thehockeywriters.com/docs/julian-lutz/) led the way in the shots department for Germany, getting six shots throughout the game. Coming into the 2024 WJC, it was clear that he was one of the players to watch. However, Sweden doubled their lead after a goal from Mattias Havelid, who ripped a slapshot in the top left corner of the net. It was almost the identical shot placement that Stenberg had in the previous period. Related: [Team Germany Players to Watch at 2024 WJC](//thehockeywriters.com/team-germany-players-to-watch-2024-world-junior-championship/) Germany went into the second intermission only down by two and still had a shot to claw back into the game despite being outshot 25-12. But going into the final frame, it was all Sweden in the third period to put this game away. Here Comes Otto Stenberg The third period saw Stenberg just put on an absolute clinic as he scored two more goals for Team Sweden in the third period to complete his hat trick. He scored both of his goals less than three minutes apart. The game was 2-0, and within a blink of an eye, it was 4-0 for Sweden because of Stenberg. Germany got outshot in the third period, 16-3, in a dominant period for the host nation. Noah Ostlund joined the scoring parry, giving Sweden the 5-0 lead, which was the last goal of the game. Sweden ended up outshooting Germany 41-15 in the game. Related: [3 Takeaways from Germany’s Upset Win Over Finland](//thehockeywriters.com/3-takeaways-from-germanys-upset-win-over-finland/) Latest News & Highlights Bittner could only do so much for Germany, as Sweden has been projected to finish second in this WJC, but he did manage to stop 36 of 41 shots that he faced. To only give up five goals to a team like Sweden is some silver lining compared to other games in the tournament so far. It was known that it would be a hard road for [Germany in this 2024 WJC](//www.deb-online.de/team/u20-nationalmannschaft/). Chance to Make Out of Group Stage Despite the loss, Germany is still in a good spot in Group A play after two games into the 2024 WJC. Their upset win over Finland has them in third place in the group ahead of the Finns and Team Latvia, and have a minus-4 goal differential after both of their games. Sign up for our NHL Prospects & Draft Substack newsletter The first four teams in each group move onto the quarter-final stage. That means if Germany can beat Latvia, they have a chance to get out of the group stage and possibly finish better or at least tie their eighth-place finish from the 2023 WJC. Entering the 2024 WJC, not a lot of experts thought Germany would place well in the tournament. However, they are in a good place to do so, even if their group includes Canada, Sweden, and Finland. Advancing out of the group is huge for Germany, as they’re looking to build up their stock in international tournaments. It will be interesting if Germany goes back to Philipp Dietl, who secured the 4-3 win for Germany over Finland. If not, will they look at Bittner after trying to keep the Germans in the game against the Swedes? Only time will tell when the puck drop rolls around in a couple of days. Their next game is Saturday, Dec. 30 versus Latvia at 1:30 p.m. eastern on NHL Network.

Il che non mi disturba, per quanto mi riguarda potrebbero ascoltare anche le mie telefonate, i miei lettori resterebbero delusi rispetto a quello che scrivo di me stesso. Però, dico, spiateci meglio. Insomma, io cosa compro prevalentemente? Magliette con supereroi, sì, a cinquantaquattro anni, come fossi un sedicenne (ho lottato per essere infantile, è un diritto acquisito), magliette di Freddie Mercury, accessori per videogiochi, libri (quelli giusti), statue da collezione (tipo la testa di Alien in scala uno a uno che spunta fuori dal mio muro), i fagioli di Bud Spencer, gadget delle mie serie tv preferite, cose così. Quindi immagino l’algoritmo che, spiandomi, avendo i miei dati, avendo il tracking delle mie ricerche, mi proponga oggetti affini a quelli che cerco, qualcosa a cui non avevo pensato e la vedo e penso: oh, toh, la voglio, pure scontata! Invece ecco cosa mi appare nella lista dei consigliati per me delle più famose piattaforme online e sui social: Fifa, scontato del 9%, quando ho sempre giocato a un gioco solo, Call of Duty, e odio il calcio. Una Yankee Candle, una candela profumata al profumo di Natale (non sento i profumi, non uso candele e odio il Natale peggio del Grinch). Un set di lamette da barba di ricambio convenientissimo, 32% di sconto, quando uso un rasoio elettrico e quindi cosa dovrei farci. Uno Smartwatch tarocco (19 euro, cosa ci hanno messo dentro non lo so), quando ho da anni un Apple Watch e uso solo prodotti Apple. Delle scarpe Clarks, mai portate in vita mia, io solo Nike (e della Nike non mi viene proposto niente), e mutande imbottite con su stampata la foto di un pene (cosa vorreste insinuare?) E poi una piastra per capelli che sembra un vibratore, un distruggi documenti e fogli come quelli che si usano per far sparire le prove, perfino un set per il fai da te, a me, che per attaccare un quadro chiamo il rumeno tuttofare. Ah, ho anche una prova, questa mirata, per provare un apparecchio acustico, scontatissima e consigliatissima per chi ha tra i 50 e i 54 anni (si diventa sordi anagraficamente prima durante il Black Friday? Credevo di sentirci bene). Non so cosa pensare, nel caso a voi capitasse la stessa cosa ma al contrario, cioè vi serve tutto ciò che propongono a me mentre voi avete scontatissima una statua di Batman a dimensioni reali e vi chiedete perché a voi, mettiamoci in contatto, forse ci spiano ma poi dobbiamo trovarci tra di noi e rivenderci gli acquisti. - dal lunedì al venerdì dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 20:00 - sabato, domenica e festivi dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 18:00. netiquette .

    "text": "Warning over climate impact of Olympic Games amid fears for athletes’ health Paris 2024 has promised to the ‘greenest ever’ Games but researchers and activists are warning of its potential impact. Academics, activists and athletes are shining a spotlight on the Olympics’ potential climate impact as the competition kicks off in Paris. Organisers said Paris 2024 would be the “greenest ever” Games, working alongside its sponsors towards economic, social and environmental responsibility. But researchers have warned that ice usage during summer Games has reached “extraordinary levels”. The report published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine said: “Beyond the financial implications for the local organising committee, this raises environmental concerns, as ice provision requires water and considerable amounts of energy for production and storage.” Paris 2024 estimated demand for 650 tonnes of ice for uses like cryotherapy, ice baths, compression pumps and treating heatstroke, according to the paper. This is more than 10 times the some 64 tonnes delivered during the Tokyo 2020 games. The researchers also warned that ice is often used to obtain benefits that are not evidence-based, potentially impairing recovery. “When planning for the provision of ice, organisers should aim to minimise the use of non evidence-based practices and promote better sustainability,” the report added. Paris 2024 has also been facing criticism over sponsorship deals, with campaigners claiming the firms’ environmental impact is at odds with the International Olympic Committee’s wider sustainability efforts. This week, protesters replaced billboards in Paris and five other major French cities with mock adverts highlighting Olympics sponsor Toyota as a high-emitting company. Posters were installed in bus stop ad spaces this week in an action co-ordinated by the Brandalism collective and Paris-based Resistance a l’Agression Publicitaire (RAP). One read: “Toyota: Proud to be the Highest Polluting Sponsor for the Olympics” and another read: “Art belongs in Paris. Giant polluters do not.” Sonnie Bird from Brandalism said: “As Olympians in Paris go faster, higher and stronger, Toyota keeps getting dirtier, deadlier and more polluting. “With Toyota as a sponsor, the Paris Olympics will leave a legacy not of gold, silver and bronze but of pollution.” Olympic champion cyclist Chris Boardman also arrived in Paris earlier this week as part of an eight-day bike ride from Manchester to raise awareness about the effects of climate change. The British athlete, who won gold in the men’s individual pursuit cycling at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, said: “We’ve had all the weather – torrential rain going over the Peak District on day one, through to scorching and intense heat and above average temperatures – we’ve done climate change in a week.” During the 550-mile ride, Mr Boardman visited different sports clubs leading the way on sustainability, including plans to be net zero by 2029 or gathering volunteers to do conservation work and litter picking. “The point of the ride was not just to highlight the issue of climate change and its impact on sport but also to give people hope,” he said. “All the projects we visited along the route have shown that we can do this, we can do it together and sport is perfectly placed to lead that change.” Last month, leading athletes and climate scientists from the University of Portsmouth warned that intense heat at the Paris games could lead to competitors collapsing and in worst-case scenarios dying. Temperatures have remained high this year after 2023 marked the warmest year globally on record. Wildlife group WWF warned that this is not a record that nations want to break ahead of the Games kicking off on Friday. Isabella O’Dowd, WWF-UK’s head of climate policy, said: “This record-breaking year has delivered a stark and clear warning from the planet about the direction we’re heading in. But we all have the power to change that. “As we come together to cheer on our athletes to break records at the Olympics, it’s important to remember the power of our collective voice, which we can use to call on the new UK Government to show real leadership, especially at this year’s climate and nature summits.” The PA news agency has contacted Paris 2024 and Toyota for comment.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, joined several congressional members in a letter urging U.S. House leadership to protect Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. The letter states that balancing the federal budget should not come at the expense of children, seniors, those with disabilities and pregnant women. “Our constituents are asking for changes to the healthcare system that will strengthen the healthcare workforce, offer low-income, working-class families expanded opportunities to save for medical expenses, support rural and underserved communities, and help new mothers,\" the letter states. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget that seeks at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal programs and services. The budget still must pass through the Senate, and it's unclear what potential specific cuts will be. RELATED: Virginia physicians call on representatives to preserve Medicaid in national budget The letter states that Medicaid cuts would threaten the viability of hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare providers in rural and underserved areas often rely heavily on Medicaid. \"Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage,\" the letter states. On Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Health Care held a call with three Virginia physicians who implored their representatives to ensure Medicaid is protected in the proposed budget. One of those state leaders is Rep. Wittman. Wittman's Tuesday statement read in part: \"No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid is an indispensable lifeline for our nation’s most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, seniors, and expectant mothers. That’s why we must act now to strengthen the program.\"",

    "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Since pledging the United States government would only recognize two genders during his inauguration, President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders impacting the transgender community. One directive aims to restrict access to gender-related health care treatments for children.\nIn response, Phoenix Children’s Hospital is indefinitely halting all hormone therapy and puberty blockers for its patients.\nParents of transgender children who have been receiving care from the provider are scrambling.\n“She is devastated right now because she feels that she’s being targeted because she cannot be herself,” said the mother of an 18-year-old transgender daughter who wishes to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation for speaking out.\nShe said her daughter has been receiving hormone therapy at Phoenix Children’s for a couple of years.\n“This isn’t something that is taken lightly we didn’t just wake up one day and say ‘oh we’re gonna put our daughter on hormone therapy,’” she said.\nFamilies like hers are in limbo after Trump signed an executive order that intends to restrict access to transgender medical interventions for people under 19.\n“People who have gender differences should be respected. They should be loved, but loving them, sometimes love means saying no to people,” said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n“The fact that any government would dare question my parenting skills,” said the transgender mother Arizona’s Family spoke with. “They have no business in our home and in my parenting.”\nTo comply with the president’s directive, Phoenix Children’s shared a letter with patients last week, which says the gender clinic is “indefinitely pausing gender-affirming medical care, specifically puberty-blocking and gender-affirming hormonal therapy.”\n“They’re suffering. They don’t feel safe. They’re afraid to leave their homes,” said Andi Young, a mother of a 17-year-old transgender son and a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ care. “Accessing gender-affirming care is life-saving.”\nWithout it, there’s concern about reversing progress.\n“That I’m gonna have to be that parent again that’s gonna be like opening the bedroom door hoping that she’s still alive,” said an anonymous parent through tears.\nLegal challenges to Trump’s executive order are ongoing. Protests outside children’s hospitals and lawsuits have been reported across the country.\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office is reviewing the constitutionality of this executive order but can’t comment further at this time.\nPrisma Health Community Care is one option for parents seeking alternate care in Phoenix.\nPrisma initially suspended hormone therapy but resumed care after a federal district court blocked enforcement of the president’s executive order.\nWhat the Valley health care providers are saying Phoenix Children’s Hospital Phoenix Children’s is bound by all federal laws and regulations for the provision of care to its patients. For this reason, Phoenix Children’s is indefinitely pausing hormone therapy services within the Gender Clinic to ensure we are in full compliance with the recent executive order.",
