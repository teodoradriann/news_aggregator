O pontífice está internado no Hospital Policlínico Gemelli, em Roma, tratando um quadro de bronquite.\nA Sala de Imprensa da Santa Sé informou a prescrição de “repouso absoluto” indicada pela equipe médica para acelerar a recuperação do Papa, e divulgou, ao meio-dia (horário local) deste domingo, a reflexão dele na missa do Jubileu dos Artistas,\n“Hoje, no Vaticano, foi celebrada a Eucaristia dedicada em particular aos artistas que vieram de várias partes do mundo para viver os Dias do Jubileu. Agradeço ao Dicastério para a Cultura e a Educação pela preparação desse evento, que nos lembra a importância da arte como linguagem universal que difunde a beleza e une os povos, ajudando a trazer harmonia ao mundo e a silenciar todo grito de guerra”, escreveu Francisco.\nVeja também\n“Dirijo minhas saudações a todos os peregrinos presentes em Roma hoje, em particular aos fiéis da Diocese de Parma, que vieram em uma peregrinação diocesana, conduzidos por seu Bispo”, acrescentou o Papa.\nAgradecimentos\nEle agradeceu ainda pelo carinho e oração nestes dias. “Assim como gostaria de agradecer aos médicos e profissionais de saúde deste Hospital por seus cuidados. Eles fazem um trabalho precioso e tão cansativo, vamos apoiá-los com a oração”.\nO papa Francisco segue sem previsão de alta. Segundo a mídia italiana, o pontífice permanecerá no hospital até que se recupere totalmente da infecção. Mas o Papa dormiu bem, tomou café da manhã e leu os jornais, como de costume.",

    "text": "Certain animals have long been considered companions for humankind. Whether for comfort and partnership or for more practical purposes like pest control and guarding people and livestock, humans have always had a relationship with animals of some sort. While Americans tend to place dogs at the top of the pet pyramid, cats, both in the past and now, hold a special and coveted space in other cultures. In ancient Egypt, for example, cats were viewed as integral parts of the culture and they were even thought to carry an important role in the afterlife, which explains why they were discovered in tombs alongside humans. Cats also served a practical purpose by chasing away pests like mice and scorpions.\nCats are also depicted in Middle Eastern and ancient Egyptian artwork dating back centuries, and immortalized in miniature sculptures, incense holders, and other trinkets and art pieces. Some sculptures and statues even had cat-like heads, with deities sharing this same description.\nIn Islam, these feline friends are afforded special privileges compared to other pets, like dogs and cattle, says Imran Malik, a practicing Muslim and interfaith coordinator of the Noor Islamic Cultural Center 's main campus.\n\"Cats have a very special place in the Muslim household and in the Muslim culture in general,\" Malik told the Dispatch. According to Malik, this reverence and adoration for cats stems from them being viewed as clean, pure, and hygienic. In fact, in mosques throughout the world, cats can be seen roaming the halls , are considered an integral part of the Islamic community and are granted leeway and access in these spiritual dwellings compared to other pets. Cats are even allowed to rest on Muslims' prayer rugs- which are required to be clean and hygienic at all times.\nThe story goes that the Prophet himself was fond of cats and owned several. There is even a well-known tale about how the Prophet woke up one morning for the call to prayers when he noticed that his own cat, Muezza, fell asleep on the sleeve of his robe. Most people would have woken their cat if it fell asleep on any of their clothes. Instead, as the story goes, Prophet Muhammad chose to cut off a piece of the sleeve of his robe and attend the prayer session, so he didn't disturb Muezza's sleep.\nIn a separate hadith, it is said that Prophet Muhammad had a traveling companion named Abu Hurayrah, a nickname that translates to \"father of cats.\" Prophet Muhammad gave him this nickname because Abu Hurayrah always carried a small cat with him in a bag. As the story goes, this same cat also saved Muhammad's life from a snake.\nWhile the authenticity of these tales is debated by Islamic scholars, they serve to highlight the fondness, respect and reverence that Islam shows towards cats, and the greater message that all Muslims are required treat all living things with empathy, compassion, and kindness.\n\"It is heavily subscribed that [you should] take care of your animals and that you should not be mean to them, you should not be aggressive to them, and you should be very humane and polite in in your relationship to your animals as well,\" says Malik.\nsmeighan@dispatch.com",

    "text": "A new method has been identified to exploit Windows Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) that bypasses existing protections and grants administrative command line access to Windows machines.\nThis technique works even when Microsoft’s recommended security measure, the DisableCMDRequest.tag file, is implemented to block the well-known Shift + F10 keyboard shortcut vulnerability.\nThe discovery highlights persistent security gaps in Windows’ initial setup process that could allow unauthorized users to gain elevated privileges and create backdoor accounts on corporate devices.\nKey Takeaways\n1. New Win + R exploit bypasses Windows OOBE security protections.\n2. Grants full Administrator access via defaultuser0 account during setup.\n3. Microsoft won't fix; only mitigation is hiding Intune reset buttons.\nWin + R OOBE Bypass Kanbach reports that the method leverages the Win + R keyboard combination to spawn a hidden Run dialogue during the OOBE process, circumventing traditional security controls.\nUnlike the widely documented Shift + F10 technique, this approach requires a specific sequence of actions to execute successfully.\nThe exploitation process begins by opening an accessibility tool such as Magnify.exe to establish proper window focus.\nOnce the Magnify window is active, pressing Win + R launches the Run dialogue, though it remains hidden in the background.\nWin + R OOBE Bypass Users can reveal its presence by using Alt + Tab to cycle through available windows. The critical vulnerability lies in the fact that this dialogue operates under the context of defaultuser0, a temporary administrative account that Windows creates during OOBE with full local Administrator group privileges.\nTo escalate privileges further, attackers can type cmd.exe into the Run dialogue and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to trigger User Account Control (UAC) consent elevation.\nWhen the UAC prompt appears and is accepted, an elevated command prompt opens with administrative privileges, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary system modifications, create backdoor accounts, or alter security configurations.\nMicrosoft’s Response This OOBE breakout method poses significant security risks, particularly in enterprise environments where users can initiate device resets through Microsoft Intune Company Portal.\nThe vulnerability allows low-privileged domain users to effectively gain local administrative access by simply performing a push-button reset and exploiting the OOBE interface.\nMicrosoft has declined to address this security issue, stating that OOBE inherently runs in an administrative session and that leaving devices unattended during setup is equivalent to leaving machines unlocked.\nThe company’s position treats this as an operational security concern rather than a software vulnerability requiring patching.\nThe primary mitigation strategy involves preventing users from accessing OOBE entirely by hiding the reset button in the Microsoft Intune admin center under Tenant administration > Customization.\nAdministrators should enable the Hide reset button on corporate Windows devices setting to prevent unauthorized device resets.\nHowever, this represents an incomplete solution that addresses symptoms rather than the underlying architectural security weakness in Windows’ setup process.\nBoost your SOC and help your team protect your business with free top-notch threat intelligence: Request TI Lookup Premium Trial .",

    "title": "3 killed in 3 separate shootings in less than 2-hour span across DC",
    "text": "Three people are dead after three separate overnight shootings that happened within the span of two hours across D.C., police said in a news conference Thursday. A 17-year-old boy from D.C., a 25-year-old man and a 38-year-old man from Temple Hills, Maryland, were killed in the shootings, which D.C. Police Commander Kevin Kentish said don’t appear to be connected. The first shooting happened around 10:45 p.m. near the intersection of Bruce and Ainger places in Southeast, in the Woodland neighborhood. When officers arrived, they found 17-year-old Quentin Brown, of Southeast, shot multiple times. He was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Less than 90 minutes later, at 12:08 a.m., officers responded to the intersection of 10th Street and Spring Road in the Northwest neighborhood of Petworth for the sound of gunshots. Police found three people who had been shot, including a 25-year-old man who was hit multiple times and was pronounced dead on scene. A woman and teen male were also shot. Both were taken to the hospital, where police said they’re expected to survive. Then, at 12:30 a.m., gunshots rang out again in the 4500 block of Sheriff Road in Northeast, in the heart of the Deanwood neighborhood. When officers arrived, they found 38-year-old Ricky Canty, of Temple Hills, Maryland, shot multiple times. He was taken to the hospital, where he later died. No one has been arrested in connection to any of the three shootings. “There’s just way too many guns out,” Kentish said. “People have access to these guns, and when they get in these arguments, when they get in these, like you said, disagreements that normally would not be handled in this manner, the first thing people are going to are guns. … There’s just way too many guns out here on the streets in the hands of the wrong people.” Kentish said at least one of the shootings appears to be a targeted incident — not a random shooting — and all three shootings are being investigated as unrelated homicides. He urged anyone with information about any of the shootings to call D.C. police at 202-727-9099 or text a tip anonymously to 50411. As the weather warms, Kentish warned that the city does typically see a spike in crime during the summer months. “We do know that there is a lot more people out in the summertime, with school being out and vacation and stuff like that, I think we all need to work together to kinda get this under wraps,” he said.
