    "text": "University of South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley didn’t waste time praising God after the Gamecocks won the national championship, days after a secular legal group called for the university to take action over comments on her faith. During a post-game interview with ESPN’s Holly Rowe after South Carolina defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes, led by star Caitlin Clark, 87-75, Staley credited God as she won her third national title since taking the helm of the Gamecocks program in 2008.\nStaley began in her interview with ESPN after breaking down in tears, “We serve an unbelievable God.” The Gamecocks are the 10th team in NCAA Division I history to finish the season undefeated. Staley thanked her team for coming back strong and finishing the season as undefeated champions.” This is the unlikeliest group to do it. And sometimes, I mean, God is funny like that. He’s funny. He rips your heart out, and He makes you believe. He makes you believe the unimaginable.”\nStaley, a 53-year-old three-time Olympic gold medalist, drew headlines last week for comments she made while speaking to reporters after her team advanced to the Final Four. Noting that her team overcame a devastating loss last year to advance so far with a different team this year, she remarked: “If you don’t believe in God, something’s wrong with you.” She said, “I’m a believer because He makes things come true. When you’re at your worst, He’s at His best.”\nThe comment\ndrew the ire of the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, which advocates for a strict separation of church and state. In a letter to University of South Carolina President Michael Amiridis last Monday, FFRF staff attorney Christopher Line cited Staley’s remarks as an example of her “ongoing promotion of her personal religious beliefs and her denigration of non-Christians through the women’s basketball program.” Line wrote, “Current and future non-Christian and nonreligious players should feel welcome and respected as part of the women’s basketball team, not be told by their coach that they are on a team that is representing Jesus and that ‘if you don’t believe in God, something is wrong with you.’”\nLine urged the university to “take action to protect its student-athletes and to ensure that Staley understands that she has been hired as a basketball coach and not a pastor.” FFRF also took offense with Staley’s promotion of team “gameday devotionals” ahead of games on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The attorney recommends the school’s leadership inform Staley of “her constitutional duties under the Establishment Clause” of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and remind her that she “may not promote religion in her capacity as head coach.”\nLine requested “notification in writing of the actions the University is taking to ensure that Staley will not continue to proselytize to her players.” In a\npost on X, Staley said she is “not ashamed to praise him for what he continues to do for me and mine.” She added, “If you’re a nonbeliever, it wasn’t for you,” she added. “[W]ish you well with your beliefs.”",

    "text": "Maden in der Mülltonne bei Sommer-Hitze: So lässt sich das Ungeziefer bekämpfen\nIn den heißen Sommermonaten haben viele mit einem Problem zu kämpfen: Maden in der Mülltonne. Doch es gibt einfache Maßnahmen, um die kleinen Larven wieder loszuwerden.\nWenn die Temperaturen steigen, vermehren sich Insekten besonders schnell – auch rund um den Hausmüll. Fliegen nutzen die Hitze, um ihre Eier in den Tonnen abzulegen. Daraus entwickeln sich innerhalb kurzer Zeit weiße Maden. Diese treten meist in großer Zahl auf und sorgen trotz ihrer Harmlosigkeit bei vielen für Ekel. Doch wie lässt sich das verhindern?\nMaden vorbeugen: Mit einfachen Maßnahmen den Befall verhindern\nUm Maden erst gar keine Chance zu geben, sollte der Müll regelmäßig entsorgt werden. Eine wöchentliche Leerung der Tonne und anschließende Reinigung kann schon viel ausrichten.\nWichtig ist außerdem, dass der Deckel immer gut verschlossen bleibt. Wer noch mehr Schutz möchte, kann eine Gummidichtung am Deckelrand anbringen oder einen speziellen Deckel für Biotonnen verwenden.\nMüll trocken halten – Maden mögen es feucht und warm\nDa sich Maden besonders in feuchten und warmen Umgebungen wohlfühlen, sollte der Müll möglichst trocken bleiben. Vor allem im Biomüll wird Feuchtigkeit schnell zum Problem. Der Restmüll ist meist recht luftdicht in Plastiktüten eingepackt, wodurch wenig ein und ausdringt. echo24.de erklärt, wann Müll in eine Tüte gehört und wann nicht.\nLaut „GEO“ helfen beim Trockenhalten von Mülltonnen Materialien wie Zeitungspapier, Sägespäne, trockenes Gras oder Heu, um Feuchtigkeit zu binden. All diese Materialien dürfen auch in die Biotonne. Auch der Standort der Tonne spielt eine Rolle: Sie sollte an einem kühlen, trockenen Platz stehen.\nSo wird man Maden wieder los – einfache Hausmittel im Einsatz\nHat sich der Nachwuchs der Fliegen bereits breitgemacht oder war die Vorsorge nicht erfolgreich, gibt es laut „GEO“ einfache Hausmittel gegen Maden. Eine Möglichkeit: Kalk in die Tonne streuen. Der entzieht den Maden Feuchtigkeit. Auch Gesteinsmehl kann verwendet werden.\nWer eine Sprühflasche hat, kann auf zwei bewährte Mischungen zurückgreifen: Entweder Wasser mit mehreren Esslöffeln Essig oder Essigessenz, oder eine Mischung aus einem Liter abgekochtem Wasser mit einem Esslöffel Pfeffer. Beide Lösungen lassen sich direkt auf die Maden sprühen.\nSelbst gebaute Mückenfalle gegen neue Eier\nUm zu verhindern, dass neue Fliegen ihre Eier ablegen, empfiehlt „GEO“ den Bau einer einfachen Mückenfalle: Dafür zwei Teile Wasser mit drei Teilen Fruchtsaft, einem Teil Essig und einigen Tropfen Spülmittel mischen. Die Mischung in ein Glas geben und direkt neben der Biotonne aufstellen. Das Spülmittel reduziert die Oberflächenspannung – Fliegen, die auf der Flüssigkeit landen, ertrinken sofort.",

    "title": "PHOTOS: Friars and Faithful Gather in Upper Room in Jerusalem to Mark the Last Supper|",
    "text": "PHOTOS: Friars and Faithful Gather in Upper Room in Jerusalem to Mark the Last Supper After the Mass at the Cenacle, as tradition dictates, the Franciscans proceeded in a procession to three churches in two other symbolic places. On Holy Thursday, the doors of the Cenacle in Jerusalem were opened to welcome the Franciscans of the Custody of the Holy Land. In this “Upper Room,” called the Cenacle in the Holy Land, Jesus had his Last Supper, washed his apostles’ feet, and instituted the Eucharist. It was here that the Franciscans celebrated the Mass of the Lord’s Supper, reenacting those same gestures. (At the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre, however, the celebration is held on Thursday morning due to the Status Quo. [Here](https://lpj.org/en/news/homily-for-holy-thursday) is Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa’s homily from that Mass.) The custos of the Holy Land, Father Francesco Patton, presided over the Eucharistic celebration at the Cenacle. In his homily, before washing the feet of six teachers and six students from the Terra Sancta School in Jerusalem, he emphasized the value of the “new commandment” that Jesus gave to his apostles here: “As I have loved you, so you also should love one another” (John 13:34). “To love means to give oneself and to serve,” he said. “In this celebration, we want to nourish ourselves with Jesus because if he is alive within us; then we too will become capable of loving one another as he loved us. And we also want to learn from Jesus not to be served but to serve.” Holy Thursday is the only day, along with Pentecost Sunday, when the Franciscans have the right to gather in the Upper Room to pray. Usually, it is a Liturgy of the Word, but since 2021 they have celebrated Mass. Outside, Israeli Army personnel ensure security. The Cenacle is at the center of strong tensions and disputes regarding ownership and rights of access and celebration. An ancient tradition places King David’s tomb here; and over the centuries, Jews and Muslims have leveraged this place to first expel the Franciscans and then to prevent Christian worship, which they deem sacrilegious. Father Narciso Klimas, historian and archivist of the Custody of the Holy Land, explained to CNA: “The Custody has all the documents confirming our ownership of Mount Zion.” Even today, traces of Christian presence are visible, both in the architecture of the place and in some symbols. “The presence of the Franciscans at the Cenacle,” Father Klimas explained, “dates back to 1342, but as early as 1333, the rulers of Naples, Robert of Anjou and Sancha of Majorca, acquired the land and donated it to the friars. This was the first headquarters of the Custody of the Holy Land.” To this day, the official title of the custos of the Holy Land is “Guardian of Mount Zion and the Holy Sepulchre.” In 1421, a rabbi submitted a petition to the local emirs, claiming the right for Muslims and Jews to this place due to the presence of King David’s tomb. One hundred years later, Father Klimas continued, “the Ottomans used this argument to gradually expel the Franciscans, until, in 1551, the sultan decreed the total expulsion of the Franciscans from Mount Zion.” The Cenacle first became a mosque and, later, in the lower part, also a synagogue. “Since then,” Father Klimas recounted, “the Franciscans have never stopped attempting to regain possession of the Cenacle. The friars have always tried to ensure a presence, at least on Holy Thursday and Pentecost, sometimes even with methods that are not exactly orthodox (such as bribing the local guardian).” Something began to change in the 19th century, during the time of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid. Since then, the Franciscans have had the right to pray at the Cenacle on Holy Thursday and Pentecost. After a failed attempt in the 1930s to regain control of it, the friars managed to purchase adjacent land where they built the convent of San Francesco ad Coenaculum (“next to the Cenacle”). In 1948, with the founding of the State of Israel, the entire Mount Zion came under Israeli control, and, until today, the Israeli state owns the entire complex of the Cenacle. The neighborhood has a strong Jewish religious character and is characterized by the presence of synagogues and rabbinical schools. “Even if the Cenacle cannot return to our hands,” Father Klimas explained, “we ask at least to celebrate regularly, even with pilgrims, without the need for special permits.” Negotiations on these matters (taxation and property) have been ongoing for over 25 years between the Holy See and the State of Israel, following the signing of the Fundamental Agreement in 1993 and the agreement recognizing the legal personality of the Catholic Church in Israel in 1997. Despite the slow pace of diplomatic negotiations, some practical progress can be observed informally. The ability to celebrate Mass on Holy Thursday at the Cenacle is among these developments. Permissions to access the site on other special occasions are usually granted without significant issues as well. After the Mass at the Cenacle, as tradition dictates, the Franciscans proceeded in a procession to three churches in two other symbolic places: the Armenian churches of St. James and of the Holy Archangels (of the Armenian Apostolic Church), and the Syro-Orthodox Church of St. Mark. This yearly visit commemorates the hospitality the friars received in the 16th century. After being expelled from the Cenacle, the Franciscans were welcomed by the Armenians for seven years while the convent of St. Saviour was purchased, to this day the headquarters of the Custody of the Holy Land. Friars and faithful prayed together and received the blessing from the representative of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Syriac Orthodox Church of St. Mark is said to be built on the house of Mary, the mother of the evangelist Mark. According to Syriac tradition, this is the place where Jesus had the Last Supper. Here as well, those present prayed together and were able to listen to the Lord’s Prayer sung in Aramaic by one of the monks, who then gave a blessing. - Keywords: [mass of the lord's supper](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/mass-of-the-lords-supper) [jerusalem](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/jerusalem)",

    "title": "Spaghetti alla carbonara in scatola, l’ultima trovata della Heinz. Vissani: “Li manderei a quel Paese”",
    "text": "Spaghetti alla carbonara in scatola della Heinz\nRoma, 30 agosto 2024 - Mentre in Italia si discute da sempre sulla ricetta originale della carbonara , guanciale o pancetta, solo tuorli o uova intere, solo pecorino o con aggiunta anche il parmigiano? Per non parlare della disputa tra spaghetti, mezze maniche o rigatoni, l'azienda americana Heinz , specializzata tra l'altro in salse e altri piatti pronti, sta per mettere in commercio nel Regno Unito il famoso piatto italiano nelle sue tin, cioè in scatola nelle sue confezioni in alluminio.\n\"Pasta in creamy sauce with pancetta” Ce n'è da far rivoltare nella tomba da Totò ad Aldo Fabrizi , passando per la Sora Lella e Alberto Sordi, stando ai più noti, ma si sa gli anglosassoni hanno da sempre reintepretato i nostri piatti tipici, lasciandoci senza parole. L'annuncio mostra l'etichetta sull'etichetta, rosa su sfondo giallo, si legge \"Spaghetti carbonara, pasta in creamy sauce with pancetta\" (pasta in salsa cremosa con pancetta, ndr), insomma un mostro in scatola che imita una specialità delle più rinomate del centro Italia (Stiamo generici per evitare anche la disputa umbro-laziale, e senza tirare in ballo i soldati americani nel dopo guerra).\nIt’s time for fuss-free Carbonara with zero drama 💅 NEW Spaghetti Carbonara, available to buy NOW on Heinz to Home and wider stores from mid September 🤩 Tap below to secure yours now 👇 https://t.co/rbpryYhY4e pic.twitter.com/qngTw1NqFQ\n— Heinz (@HeinzUK) August 29, 2024 Per la Generazione Z che non sa cucinare Secondo il Daily Mail l'obiettivo dell'azienda è fornire alla Generazione Z un piatto di pasta già pronto al costo di 2 sterline (meno di 2,50 euro, ndr). Giovani che non sanno prendere in mano una pentola e preferirebbero trovare pasti pronti e rapidi per il microonde o solo scaldare, conferma un sondaggio. Comunque non è la prima volta che l'azienda americana guarda nelle nostre cucine per il suo scatolame, vedi i \"beef ravioli\", gli \"spaghetti bolognese\" o gli \"hoops\" (gli anellini al pomodoro, ndr) fino all'incredibile mac&cheese (pasta al formaggio).\nVissani: “Li manderei a quel Paese” Le reazioni non sono mancate a partire da Gianfranco Vissani, che non ha risparmiato le critiche: \"Li manderei a quel Paese, con queste proposte stanno distruggendo la cultura italiana e la nostra cucina. Si dovrebbero vergognare\". Seguito dalla chef Cristina Bowerman , stella Michelin al Glass Hostaria di Roma: \" Una bastardizzazione della nostra cucina . La trovo un'idea orrenda e il rischio è che i consumatori provino prima questa versione in scatola rispetto all'originale, magari rimanendone perfino delusi\". Meno preoccupato lo chef Antonello Colonna : \"Ma davvero dobbiamo preoccuparci degli anglosassoni che mettono la carbonara nelle lattine?\", che aggiunge riferendosi alle lattine rese celebri anche da Andy Warhol: \"Io adoro lo scatolame, quello di qualità, ma faccio parte di quella scuola di pensiero secondo cui ognuno deve fare quello che vuole. Di certo non mi spaventano: la nostra cucina ha un'identità talmente forte che, anche se tutti provano a inquinare le nostre tradizioni culinarie, la nostra cucina rimarrà sempre egemone\".\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",
