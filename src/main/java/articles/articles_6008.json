    "text": "Something shocking is happening in American classrooms right now, and the numbers tell an alarming story. Average reading scores dropped 5 points for both 4th and 8th graders from 2019 to 2024, while math scores dipped 3 points for 4th graders and 8 points for 8th graders between 2019 and 2024. Think about what this means – these aren’t just abstract statistics, they represent millions of kids who can’t read at grade level or solve basic math problems. Nearly five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation is below its 2019, or pre-pandemic, scores in both grades and subjects on The Nation’s Report Card. The pandemic didn’t just disrupt education temporarily; it created wounds that are still bleeding. Only two states have managed to surpass their pre-pandemic scores in a single grade and subject: Louisiana in 4th grade reading and Alabama in 4th grade math. On a 500-point scale, the lowest-performing students generally score about 100 points below the highest-performing students in 2024. Picture this: while some kids are reading complex novels, others are struggling with basic sentences. The huge pandemic learning losses for students in the bottom 10 percent grew 70 percent larger between 2022 and 2024, while learning losses for students in the bottom 25 percent grew 25 percent larger. It’s like watching America split into two different countries – one where education thrives and another where it barely survives. Lower-performing fourth and eighth graders posted the worst reading scores in over 30 years. The students who need help the most are falling further behind than ever before in modern history. The teacher shortage has reached levels that would shock most Americans. An estimated 400,000-plus teaching positions in the United States are either unfilled or filled by teachers not fully certified for their assignments, representing about 1 in 8 of all teaching positions nationally. That means if you walked into eight random classrooms, one would likely have an unqualified teacher. A whopping 74% of districts had trouble filling their open positions for the 2024-25 school year, with special education, science, and foreign language positions most likely to go unfilled. Florida leads the crisis with over 5,000 vacancies, the highest demand in the nation. When schools can’t find qualified teachers, kids suffer – it’s that simple. K-12 public schools spend $17,277 per pupil, with nationwide public K-12 expenditures totaling $857.2 billion. To put that in perspective, that’s more money than many countries’ entire economies. Total public expenditures on education are equivalent to 3.67% of taxpayer income. Yet despite this massive investment, test scores continue falling. New York schools spend the most on K-12 education per pupil, while California spends the most on postsecondary education. The question haunting educators and taxpayers alike is simple: if we’re spending record amounts, where’s the improvement? Money alone clearly isn’t solving our education crisis. College enrollment totaled 19.28 million undergraduate students nationwide in Fall 2024, down 8.43% from peak enrollment in 2010 (21.0 million), though projections indicate slightly higher enrollment for Fall 2025 undergraduate enrollment (19.57 million). This isn’t just a pandemic blip – it’s a fundamental shift in how young Americans view college. 62.0% of high school graduates go on to postsecondary study, but enrollment among new high school graduates has declined 11.6% since its peak in 2009 (70.1%). Students are voting with their feet, choosing alternatives to traditional four-year degrees. 45 states have seen a decline in postsecondary enrollment since 2010, with Iowa and Alaska seeing the largest declines at 47% and 42.1% respectively. The college-for-everyone mentality is cracking under pressure. Here’s some good news buried in the data: Between 1993 and 2023, educational attainment skyrocketed among adults aged 25 and older, with a 74.9% increase in college graduates and high school completion increasing 14.0%. Currently, 91.4% of Americans aged 25 years and older have attained at least a high school diploma; 38.3% are college graduates. This shows incredible progress over decades. 49.1% of students who entered a bachelor’s program in 2016 had a degree four years later, and 64.6% had their bachelor’s degree within six years of entry. Despite current challenges, America continues producing more educated adults than ever before. The gender gap in education has also shifted dramatically, with women now earning more degrees than men. The reading crisis deserves its own spotlight because it’s that serious. Average reading scores fell 2 points for both grades 4 and 8 just since 2022, continuing a downward trend that began in 2019. Think about kindergarteners who started school during the pandemic – they’re now fourth graders, and their reading scores show the damage. Fewer than a third of students nationwide are working at the NAEP Proficient level in reading at both grades, with around 40 percent of 4th graders working below the NAEP Basic level in reading, the largest percentage since 2002. Reading isn’t just one subject – it’s the foundation for everything else. When kids can’t read well, they struggle in science, social studies, and even math word problems. In 2024, the average fourth-grade math score was 2 points higher compared to 2022, with thirty-nine percent of fourth-grade students performing at or above the NAEP Proficient level on the mathematics assessment. This small uptick offers hope in an otherwise dark landscape. However, eighth grade tells a different story entirely. The average math score in 8th grade is flat in 2024 compared to 2022, with no state or district making gains in 8th grade math in 2024. A little more than a quarter of 8th graders nationwide are performing at or above the NAEP Proficient level in math, while nearly 40 percent of 8th graders are working below NAEP Basic. The progress in elementary math gives educators something to build on, but the middle school math crisis demands immediate attention. The Education Department is the main conduit for federal aid to public K-12 schools and a major lender to college students, providing grants to help local public K-12 schools educate disadvantaged and disabled students, assisting low- and middle-income college students, and serving as the largest source of loans for college students. As of last September, 4,209 people worked there, employing almost exactly as many people in September 2024 as it did 15 years earlier (4,218 in 2009). The department distributed billions during the pandemic: In fiscal 2024, the department provided $55 billion in COVID-19 grants to pre-K programs, elementary and secondary schools, and since fiscal 2020, it has granted $186 billion in such aid. Yet questions remain about its future role as political debates intensify about federal involvement in education. Some subjects are in crisis mode when it comes to finding qualified teachers. 86% of public schools struggle to hire educators, with the shortage particularly acute in STEM fields and foreign languages. Special education represents perhaps the most critical shortage area across the country. The problem is most pronounced in special education where teacher recruitment and retention are particularly challenging, though some states like North Dakota have launched paraprofessional-to-teacher-pipeline programs focused on special education. These shortages aren’t just statistics – they mean kids with disabilities and learning differences aren’t getting the specialized help they desperately need. When schools can’t find qualified special education teachers, they’re forced to use substitutes or overload existing teachers, neither of which serves students well. Not all states are struggling equally, creating a patchwork of educational opportunity across America. Louisiana and Alabama show signs of hope, with Louisiana’s success attributed to heavily focusing on the science of reading for several years. Meanwhile, other states are drowning in challenges. Florida faces over 5,000 teacher vacancies – the highest demand in the nation – with core issues including low pay, long hours, and political interference in education. Despite this, West Virginia actually has more vacancies per student with 59 vacancies per 10,000 students compared to Florida’s nearly 19. Iowa seems to be handling their teacher shortage better, with 98% of teacher vacancies filled, coinciding with approval of a 3% pay increase for 2024. These differences show that state policies and priorities matter enormously. Here’s a factor that often gets overlooked but is crucial to understanding educational challenges: kids simply aren’t showing up to school enough. There’s a strong relationship between student absenteeism and NAEP performance, as students who are lower performers are more likely to be absent, and their scores are the lowest. If students aren’t in school, they can’t learn. This creates a vicious cycle – struggling students miss more school, fall further behind, get frustrated, and miss even more school. The pandemic normalized absence in ways that educators are still grappling with. Chronic absenteeism has become a stubborn problem that requires creative solutions, from transportation help to addressing underlying family issues that keep kids home. When you look at American education today, you see a system in serious trouble but not without hope. We’re spending more money than ever, yet test scores keep falling. Teachers are leaving faster than we can replace them, creating chaos in classrooms. The kids who need help most are being left behind at historic rates. But scattered throughout this grim picture are bright spots – states that have found ways to improve reading, districts that have solved their teacher shortages, and communities that refuse to give up on their students. The question isn’t whether American education can be fixed, but whether we have the will to make the hard choices necessary to fix it.

    "text": "OPEN DE AUSTRALIA\nDjokovic cumple con su amenaza y se retira ante Zverev entre abucheos: \"Puede haber sido el último\"\nEl serbio evidenció que sus problemas físicos no eran mentira y tras ceder el primer set ante el alemán optó por retirarse. Zverev, a su tercera final de Grand Slam\nNo era un farol. Las dudas de Novak Djokovic sobre su estado físico que tanto revuelo cogieron tras el partido ante Carlos Alcaraz, eran muy reales. Tanto, que el serbio tan solo pudo disputar un set ante Alexander Zverev en su partido de semifinales.\nNo pareció estar tan tocado en ningún momento en la hora y 22 minutos que duró un parcial que se decantó del lado del alemán en un apretado 'tie break', con una volea aparentemente sencilla para Djokovic, que acabó por estrellarse en la red.\nTras ello, el serbio no lo dudó un solo segundo y se quedó en el centro de la pista para darle la mano directamente a Zverev, que parecía no estarse creyendo lo sucedido.\nNo dio muestras de estar tan al límite el serbio, que pareció tener clara la hoja de ruta en el partido. Avisó ante Alcaraz que de haber perdido el segundo set muy probablemente hubiera optado por la opción de retirarse, y ante Zverev, parecía tener igual de claro. De perder el set, se acababa la aventura hacia su 25º título de Grand Slam. Y así fue.\nUn hecho que la gente no se tomó nada bien y despidió a su diez veces campeón entre abucheos, mientras Djokovic con mirada desafiante respondía con los dedos pulgares hacia arriba.\n\"Por favor, muchachos, no abucheen a un jugador que se lesiona. Sé que todos pagaron las entradas, pero Novak ha dado todo de su vida al deporte en los últimos 20 años” apuntó Zverev en el inicio de su comparecencia a pie de pista.\nEl alemán pone rumbo a su tercera final de Grand Slam, la primera en Australia, tras los intentos fallidos en el US Open 2020 ante Thiem, y en el pasado Roland Garros ante Carlos Alcaraz.\nSu rival será Jannik Sinner o Ben Shelton, que disputarán la segunda semifinal en la sesión nocturna.\n\"PUEDE HABER SIDO MI ÚLTIMO OPEN DE AUSTRALIA\"\nDjokovic aseguró tras su retirada en las semifinales del Open de Australia ante Alexander Zverev que de haber ganado el set disputado hubiera intentado seguir en el partido, aunque no escondió que \"la cosa iba de mal en peor\".\n\"No he tocado una pelota desde el partido con Alcaraz hasta una hora del partido de hoy. Hice todo lo que pude para manejar el desgarro muscular que sufrí. Los medicamentos, el trabajo del fisio y el vendaje ayudaron, pero sólo funcionaron hasta cierto punto. Hacia el final del primer set empecé a sentir más y más dolor\" explicó 'Nole' argumentando su decisión de retirarse.\nUna lesión que le lastra en su camino para conseguir el 25º título de Grand Slam de su carrera, que no sabe todavía si podrá volver a intentar conquistar. “Hay alguna posibilidad de que este haya sido mi último. ¿Quién sabe? Tendré que ver cómo va la temporada. Quiero seguir adelante” aseguró Djokovic, que todo apunta a que seguirá dando guerra.\nEl de Belgrado tampoco pudo confirmar a los periodistas en rueda de prensa si su aventura junto al británico Andy Murray como entrenador proseguirá. “No lo sé. Estamos ahora decepcionados con lo que acaba de suceder, no hemos hablado del futuro todavía. Acabamos de salir de la pista. Tendré una charla con Andy y le agradeceré por haber estado aquí conmigo. Le daré mi valoración y veremos cómo se siente él, y de ahí daremos el siguiente paso”, comentó.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "title": "US announces $325 million in funding to boost Puerto Rico solar projects as power outages persist",
    "text": "SAN JUAN – The U.S. government announced Thursday that $325 million in federal funds will be available for solar and battery storage installations across Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory struggles with chronic power outages . The program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, will target community centers and healthcare facilities, as well as common areas in subsidized, multi-family housing. Recommended Videos “Households aren’t the only place you need power during and after an emergency,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during a visit to Puerto Rico. The announcement comes amid widespread anger over outages that repeatedly leave Puerto Ricans in the dark. The island of 3.2 million people has a more than 40% poverty rate and some cannot afford a generator. Government officials say the outages also endanger the lives of those who depend on oxygen, refrigerated insulin and dialysis machines. Granholm on Thursday visited the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel, one of several towns in the area hit by a power outage in June that left 10,000 customers in the dark. That same month, another widespread outage left some 350,000 customers without power across Puerto Rico, prompting Gov. Pedro Pierluisi to order an investigation. “It is unacceptable,” Granholm said of the situation. The outage in Santa Isabel and nearby towns prompted Luma, a private company that operates the transmission and distribution of power, to install emergency generators. Luma also launched a $4-million effort to transport and install a new mega transformer in the area, but the plan failed after crews discovered that an “internal problem” rendered the equipment unusable, further enraging customers and government officials. Luma recently said it would relocate another transformer based in the southeast coastal town of Maunabo, but the announcement angered the local mayor, who blocked access to the equipment, saying his town depended on it. Luma has said that transformer is not essential to providing electricity to Maunabo. On Sunday, Luma warned that at least 11 transformers in electric substations across Puerto Rico are “vulnerable,” and if they were to fail, tens of thousands of customers would be left without power. Puerto Rico’s power grid remains frail nearly seven years after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, leaving some without electricity for up to a year. While the storm razed the power grid, it had long been crumbling given a lack of investment and maintenance by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is s till trying to restructure more than $9 billion in debt . Prior to Maria, renewable energy generation in Puerto Rico was at 3%. It has since grown to 9% thanks to homes and businesses that have been able to afford to install rooftop solar and storage, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Amid the outages, Puerto Ricans have been hit with power bill increases that many have decried. Puerto Rico’s electricity rate is now 41% higher than the average U.S. rate. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy also announced an $861 million loan guarantee to help build two solar photovoltaic farms in the southern towns of Guayama and Salinas. The guarantee was offered to Clean Flexible Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of AES Corporation and TotalEnergies Holdings USA, Inc. Prior to arriving in Puerto Rico, Granholm visited the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday, where officials announced $100 million in federal funds to help buy fuel storage facilities. The U.S. territory also has struggled with chronic power outages in recent years, with island-wide outages hitting St. John and St. Thomas the day Granholm visited. Nearly three months ago, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. declared a state of emergency following ongoing blackouts on St. Croix. The U.S. Virgin Islands Water & Power Authority faces crumbling infrastructure, with various local agencies including the waste management authorities and entities such as hospitals owing more than $11 million in total accumulated debt.",

    "title": "A cuatro años del crimen de Cecilia Basaldúa en Punilla, la familia reclama justicia",
    "text": "Este jueves 25 de abril se cumplen cuatro años del hallazgo del cuerpo de Cecilia Basaldúa, la mochilera de 35 años oriunda de Buenos Aires que fue asesinada en Capilla del Monte. Apareció, sin vida, tras varios días de búsqueda, a la vera del río Calabalumba. La búsqueda de la mujer había comenzado el 5 de abril, en tiempos del más estricto Aislamiento Social Preventivo Obligatorio (Aspo) decretado por el Gobierno por la pandemia. El 25 de abril de 2020, dos baqueanos encontraron el cuerpo a la orilla del río, cerca del basural de Capilla del Monte. Desde entonces, la investigación judicial se llenó de interrogantes, hasta ahora no resueltos. Daniel Basaldúa y Susana Reyes, los padres de la mujer, viajaron ahora a Córdoba para volver a pedir que se agilice la investigación por el crimen luego de que en julio de 2022 el tribunal que juzgó al único acusado y detenido, Lucas Bustos, decidiera absolverlo por falta de pruebas en su contra. Este jueves fueron recibidos en la ciudad de Córdoba por la fiscal adjunta de la Provincia, Bettina Croppi, a quien le reclamaron mayor celeridad en la causa. En las escalinatas de Tribunales, organizaciones sociales y amigos de la familia plantaron banderas y estandartes con el rostro de Cecilia, como una manera de elevar el reclamo de justicia. Al volver a foja cera, la investigación recayó en la Fiscalía de Cruz del Eje, tras la caída en el juicio de la hipótesis de la fiscal de Cosquín, Paula Kelm, quien sigue siendo cuestionada por la familia Basaldúa. Según lo que le adelantaron en los Tribunales a la familia, en las próximas horas será designado Nelson Lingua como fiscal de Cruz del Eje. “Lo que pedimos es que nombren al fiscal y nos prometieron que en esta semana estará la firma. También nos dijeron que se está investigando, que hay cosas que no se pueden decir por ahora”, expresó Daniel Basaldúa a La Voz. “La expectativa nuestra es que se pongan las pilas”, dijo, y agregó: “Yo creo que se va a saber quién fue. Esperamos que los investigadores busquen y lo encuentren”. Por su parte, Daniela Pavón, abogada de la querella y una de las participantes del encuentro con la fiscal Croppi, sostuvo que la causa está en tiempo de espera. “Siguen las demoras e irregularidades. Se sigue investigando, pero al tiempo de la Justicia. Hoy nos sacaron dos notificaciones de pedidos que habíamos presentado en noviembre porque sabían que veníamos”, expresó la letrada. Pavón sostuvo que lo que se necesita ya es que alguien se ponga al frente de la investigación. “La investigación comenzó nuevamente de foja cero, pero necesitamos a alguien que se ponga al frente, que la guíe, que la conduzca. Ahora está al frente de una instructora que no tiene la capacidad de tomar decisiones”, insistió. Emoción y pedido Susana Reyes, la mamá de Cecilia, fue la encargada de leer un documento que elaboraron junto al equipo de abogados que apoya a la familia en este caso. El documento señala que estos cuatro años fueron “de impunidad” con “el sistema judicial” que sigue violentando sistemáticamente a quienes pedimos y exigimos justicia por ella”. “La causa volvió a fojas cero por pedido de la querella a fines de 2022, luego de pasar por un juicio vergonzoso sin precedentes. Hoy se está investigando, pero el tiempo pasa y los asesinos de Cecilia siguen libres e impunes. No tenemos fiscal en esta causa, pese a las promesas desde noviembre del año pasado y no están las respuestas que debe dar un sistema judicial a la familia de las víctimas. Exigimos al fiscal general que cumpla con lo prometido y que el fiscal designado se ponga al frente de esta investigación”, agrega el documento. Y sigue: “Sin alguien que guíe esta causa estamos convencidas que es muy difícil llegar a los culpables. De manera reiterada, los fiscales que han pasado por Cruz del Eje, lejos de investigar de manera responsable, han tratado de no intervenir e involucrarse. Una evidencia más que nos demuestra cómo esta causa –desde su inicio- ha estado plagada de irregularidades”.",

    "title": "Les cyberattaques : Le nouveau front dans la rivalité Maroc-Algérie",
    "text": "La rivalité entre le Maroc et l'Algérie a dépassé les querelles sur les réseaux sociaux autour du patrimoine culturel, culinaire et vestimentaire pour s'étendre au domaine des cyberattaques. Les tensions entre les deux nations se sont propagées dans le cyberespace, où des hackers marocains et algériens s'en prennent à des sites gouvernementaux, des comptes sur les réseaux sociaux et des institutions médiatiques.\nRécemment, des hackers algériens ont orchestré une attaque significative en divulguant un grand volume de données sensibles. Le groupe algérien JabaRoot DZ a mené une série de cyberattaques contre les sites du ministère marocain de l'Inclusion économique et de la Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS).\nCette attaque est la plus marquante d'une longue série de cyberattaques mutuelles entre hackers des deux pays, une cyberguerre en escalade alimentée par des tensions politiques. Yabiladi a récapitulé les incidents cybernétiques entre hackers marocains et algériens au cours des 15 dernières années, souvent liés à des développements politiques ou des points de tension, tels que la question du Sahara occidental et le soutien de l'Algérie au Polisario.\nCyberattaques politisées\nEn 2010, après les événements tragiques de Gdim Izik où 11 agents de sécurité marocains ont été tués, des hackers marocains ont ciblé les sites du ministère de l'Intérieur algérien et de l'Office National du Tourisme Algérien. Ces attaques ont été décrites comme des actes de «vengeance» et de représailles pour la violence à Laâyoune.\nLe même mois de novembre 2010, des hackers marocains ont infiltré le site de l'ambassade d'Algérie aux États-Unis, y laissant un drapeau marocain et l'hymne national en guise de signature.\nCes offensives cybernétiques ont continué en 2011, avec des hackers marocains attaquant plusieurs sites gouvernementaux algériens, notamment celui de l'administration fiscale. Ils ont laissé un message défiant sur la page d'accueil : «Les forces dissuasives marocaines défendent les intérêts suprêmes du Royaume.» La page affichait également la devise nationale marocaine, «Dieu, la patrie, le roi», ainsi qu'une carte du Maroc ornée du drapeau national.\nSelon le journal algérien TSA, des hackers marocains ont également infiltré d'autres sites financiers et gouvernementaux, y compris la bourse d'Alger. Les hackers algériens ont rapidement riposté en piratant 174 sites d'entreprises et d'institutions marocaines, laissant un message «en réponse à un groupe d'idiots marocains». Ces attaques ont coïncidé avec un discours du roi Mohammed VI à l'occasion du 36e anniversaire de la Marche Verte, où il a appelé l'Algérie à contribuer à un Maghreb fort et uni.\nEn 2013, des hackers marocains ont ciblé le site de la chaîne de télévision publique algérienne (ENTV), laissant des messages affirmant la souveraineté du Maroc sur le Sahara. Le même jour, ils auraient également infiltré le site de la bourse algérienne. Les hackers marocains ciblaient fréquemment les journaux algériens.\nEn 2014, des groupes de hackers algériens ont riposté. Selon un rapport de l'Institut Marocain d'Analyse de Politique (MIPA), des sites web, y compris celui du ministère marocain des Affaires étrangères et d'autres portails gouvernementaux, ont été attaqués par des hackers algériens.\n«Pas de paix entre les systèmes»\nEn 2020, la cyberguerre entre les deux nations s'est encore intensifiée. Cette année-là, des hackers marocains ont infiltré le site du ministère algérien de la Santé, ainsi que ceux de l'agence nationale pour le développement des ressources en hydrocarbures, UNESCO Algérie, et d'autres, y compris le Programme de soutien à la politique sectorielle environnementale, l'ONID et l'hôtel Mazafran.\nEn novembre 2021, des hackers algériens ont riposté en piratant le site de la Confédération Générale des Entreprises du Maroc (CGEM), remplaçant son contenu par un drapeau algérien et le message : «Pas de paix entre les systèmes». En réponse, le Morocco Hack Team a ciblé le site du ministère algérien des Finances.\nPlus tôt la même année, des hackers marocains ont pénétré 280 sites algériens, y compris de nombreux affiliés au gouvernement. L'attaque aurait été en réponse à des commentaires jugés «insultants» sur le roi Mohammed VI par la chaîne Al-Shorouk TV.\nLa cyberguerre a continué en 2022. En mars, le ministère algérien de la Justice a accusé des hackers marocains d'avoir compromis son compte Twitter officiel, qui a brièvement publié des messages pro-russes et des accusations incendiaires contre le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky avant que les tweets ne soient supprimés.\nEn août de la même année, le site de l'Université des Sciences Dhar El Mahraz de Fès (FSDM) a été piraté par un jeune hacker algérien. En janvier 2023, le site de la Bibliothèque Nationale du Royaume du Maroc (BNRM) a été compromis. Les hackers ont laissé un message : «Nous envoyons un message aux hackers marocains : arrêtez de divulguer des données algériennes et nous arrêterons.»\nPeu de temps après, des données confidentielles du ministère marocain de l'Éducation nationale ont été publiées, exposant des informations sur près d'un million d'étudiants. En représailles, des milliers de dossiers sur des étudiants algériens ont été divulgués en ligne, selon des rapports médiatiques.\nUn champ de bataille alternatif\nLe conflit cybernétique en cours continue de compromettre des données sensibles et de perturber l'infrastructure numérique dans les deux pays. Les experts décrivent ces incidents comme une nouvelle forme de confrontation.\nDans un article intitulé Une guerre de l'ombre cybernétique entre l'Algérie et le Maroc, le chercheur en affaires africaines Hamdi Bachir soutient que cette vague croissante de cyberattaques marque une nouvelle phase d'hostilité non conventionnelle. Il avertit que ces attaques sont susceptibles de s'intensifier davantage, ciblant les systèmes gouvernementaux, l'infrastructure, les services publics, les installations militaires et les secteurs économiques, notamment le pétrole et le gaz.\nArrivant à une conclusion similaire, la société de cyber-intelligence spécialisée dans la gestion du paysage des menaces externes, CYFIRMA, a déclaré dans un rapport de 2024 sur les cyberattaques au Maroc que les récentes attaques dans le pays «sont devenues un outil puissant pour infliger des dommages et affirmer une influence».\nAu-delà des considérations géopolitiques, ces attaques mettent en évidence la vulnérabilité du Maroc. Une analyse de MIPA sur les réalisations et les défis de la cybersécurité au Maroc indique que la nature évolutive des cyberattaques «nécessite une adaptation constante, une conformité avec le contexte international, et un investissement dans des solutions technologiques, des ressources humaines, et une coopération nationale et internationale pour assurer une posture de cybersécurité robuste».",

    "title": "Nota al pie celebra un nuevo encuentro literario con Elvira Sastre como protagonista | Vanity Fair",
    "text": "La sala abarrotada de la 7ª planta de la sede de Openbank en Madrid demostraba que después del verano había ganas de arrancar este nuevo curso de Nota al pie, de sus encuentros literarios y la posibilidad de conversar con los autores más relevantes del panorama actual. Ayer se grabó en directo un nuevo episodio del Club de lectura de Openbank by Vanity Fair con Elvira Sastre como invitada. La periodista Lucía Taboada y el Director de Productos de Openbank, Mateo Rodríguez-Braun preguntaron a la escritora y periodista sobre su última novela, Las vulnerabilidades. Un thriller psicológico que nace en una red social. Sara escribe un mensaje a Elvira, la narradora de la historia, en una situación desesperada y le pide ayuda. Así comienza esta relación de dependencia que se vuelve asfixiante y que cuestiona las consecuencias que puede tener el simple gesto de ayudar a los demás. La historia se inspira en un episodio real vivido por la autora y el camino para contarlo fue tan duro como inesperado su final. “Empecé a escribir este libro para dar sentido en mi cabeza a una cosa que había pasado, pero cuando acabé me di cuenta de que eso no había funcionado pero a cambio descubrí que tenía capacidad para ahondar en mi interior y para afrontar un reto muy complicado como escritora. Lo conseguí a duras penas, pero sobreviví”, reflexiona Sastre.\\nLa escritora explica que este libro supone hacer un viaje a las profundidades sin saber bien cómo vas a salir. Es una historia dura, que puede no ser la apropiada para determinados momentos vitales, pero que es vital para adentrarse en reflexiones tan necesarias como incómodas: qué está fallando en la ayuda a las mujeres víctimas de violencia de género, por qué algo tan importante como la salud mental solo está al alcance de los privilegiados o la romantización de cuidar a personas dependientes, por citar algunas.\\nElvira Sastre reconoce que ha sentido pudor escribiendo o contando ciertas cosas, “es curioso porque en mis poemas cuento muchas cosas que son absolutamente personales y nunca he sentido pudor, con esta novela sí porque ha sido un descenso a las profundidades y he tenido que reconocer esas zonas oscuras que no son tan cómodas y ahí ha estado la dificultad”.\\nLa poesía, género en el que la autora ha publicado varios títulos de gran éxito, está muy presente en esta novela pues según explica ella es su lenguaje y forma parte de su manera de ver el mundo, “cuando me planto ante la narrativa en las dos novelas que he escrito he tenido siempre un primer intento de no dejar que entre la poesía en la novela, pero luego me doy cuenta de que no puedo huir de eso y tampoco quiero, así que he aprendido a canalizarla en ciertos lugares”.\\nPara escribir este libro Elvira Sastre cuenta que se ha fijado mucho en mujeres escritoras como Annie Ernaux, Joan Didion o Vivian Gornick, “fueron el ejemplo perfecto, cuando ves que alguien ha conseguido algo sirve de espejo para creer que tú lo puedes hacer. Estas autoras fueron mis guías espirituales para atreverme a escribir esta novela y poder hacerla”.\\nLa autoexigencia, el vínculo con la familia y cómo de necesario es empezar a ver a nuestros padres como personas o poner límites para cuidar nuestra propia salud mental fueron otros de los temas que se trataron durante la grabación de este nuevo episodio que podremos escuchar muy pronto en todas las plataformas.\\nDespués de esta interesante conversación y con muchos temas en los que reflexionar los asistentes pudieron adquirir la nueva novela u otros libros de Elvira Sastre, gracias a la librería amiga Crazy Mary, para llevárselo firmado por la autora. Con un cóctel se dio por concluida esta cita en la que lectores y autores comparten reflexiones y su pasión por la literatura. Este episodio, en el que por cierto, la escritora da una primicia, podrá escucharse muy pronto al completo en las diferentes plataformas.",

    "text": "KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD BAND SUNDAY, MARCH 10, 2024 AT 8PM\nBUY TICKETS HERE\nPut an ear to the door of FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, back in late2019 and you’d have heard it. The first stirrings of a new studio album from the man who pulled American roots into the 21st century. Melodies forming, riffs taking shape, grooves building, stories of loss and redemption spun by a crack team of sympatico songwriters. The road from that first writing session to the finished copy of Dirt On My Diamonds you hold in your hands, smiles Kenny Wayne Shepherd, has been quite a ride. “Every record I make is a moment in time. And this is a really special moment.”\nSince the release of his debut album, 1995’s Ledbetter Heights, this Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum bandleader still sounds like the future of the blues. Approach Dirt On My Diamonds expecting autopilot twelve-bars and you’ll instead be thrown a volley of curveballs, from the modern urban edge of Sweet & Low and Best Of Times’ socio-political observations to the speaker-tearing production from Shepherd and his partner-in-sound of recent years, Marshall Altman. “Working with Marshall, it’s like any productive relationship,” considers the guitarist. “We put our strengths together and push each other.”\nThroughout, as the album title suggests, the grit and emotional honesty of these new songs is prized above guitar pyrotechnics (even for one of the modern scene’s most valuable players).Of the Dirt On My Diamonds’ guiding philosophy, “Life has imperfections, and I actually prefer it that way. The imperfections are what make it interesting.”\nSince his birth in North Louisiana, in 1977, Shepherd’s own life has never followed the script. Steeped in classic blues and rock ‘n’ roll from an early age by his dad – a respected Louisiana radio personality and promoter – the kid soon reached for his first Fender Stratocaster and found he didn’t require lessons to make it cry and wail. Long before Warner Brothers subsidiary Giant Records offered a deal, Shepherd had clocked up countless miles on a merciless touring schedule of clubs he was still too young to drink in. “For the first five years,” he says, “I was on the road non-stop.”\nBut that old-school apprenticeship sharpened both his chops and songcraft to a razor’s edge. Following up the aforementioned Ledbetter Heights, Shepherd changed his world forever with 1997’s Trouble Is…, the breakthrough second album that saw him write songs of such eye-opening maturity as Blue On Black, and sell over one million copies in an era when post-grunge supposedly held sway. “It was vindication,” he nods.\nShepherd’s studio releases kept gathering pace,from1999’s Live On to 2004’s The Place You’re In, before 2007’s two time Grammy-nominated album/documentary Ten Days Out: Blues From The Backroads saw him stand up and be counted alongside such giants as B.B. King, Hubert Sumlin and Pinetop Perkins. “I always felt like I owed it to those people to mention their names and the impact they had on me,”he says, “because otherwise you’re doing them a disservice.”\nIn 2013 and 2016, he even found the bandwidth for two albums with blues-rock supergroup The Rides, also featuring Stephen Stills and Barry Goldberg. But to understand the direction of travel on Dirt On My Diamonds, it pays to revisit 2017’s Lay It On Down, on which Shepherd’s enduring partnership with producer Marshall Altman began. “After Lay It On Down and The Traveler, this is my third consecutive album working with Marshall, and the evolution almost feels like chapters in a book. To me, this album sounds incredibly fresh, modern and current.”\nIt all started with the aforementioned session at FAME, where Shepherd and his favorite co-writers threw out the rulebook. “Nothing was off-limits,” says the bandleader of penning the songs whose vocal parts would be split down the line between himself and co-vocalist Noah Hunt. “We just wrote non-stop for three days, throwing out songs and letting the good stuff rise to the top. Sometimes with these writing sessions, especially in towns like Nashville, people will set up an appointment, like, ‘OK, we’ll get together from one til three’. But this time, we weren’t under the gun, it was just a bunch of guys having fun writing music.And of course, you feel the history down there in Muscle Shoals. You feel it in the air at a studio like FAME.”\nWhen it came to tracking, the bulk of the sessions went down at the Band House Studios in Los Angeles, with the lineup completed by Chris Layton (drums), Kevin McCormick (bass) and Jimmy McGorman (keys).“It was a really cool, intimate, old-school studio with analogue everything, but it’s since been torn down to make way for a high-rise condo,” sighs Shepherd.\nRolling with the punches, the project recommenced at a friend’s studio in Burbank for the handful of brass, vocal and guitar overdubs. “But the least amount necessary,” stresses the bandleader. “For me, it’s all about capturing the essence of the band playing live together, because that’s what we do best.”\nWith material this strong, no polish was needed. As on any KWS album, songs are the currency, and the seven originals from Dirt On My Diamonds Volume 1 demand to be heard, lifting listeners above their circumstances at a time when life often feels bleak and bone-raw. “I didn’t want this record to be dark or dreary,” considers Shepherd. “There’s not a lot of incredibly heart-wrenching or difficult subject matter. You know, there’s one blues song called Ease My Mind which is a little dark, about that blues-suffering experience. You Can’t Love Me is about a guy that loves a girl with some unresolved issues. But even that has this really positive sound to it. My goal is always to make music that makes people feel good, regardless of what it’s about.”\nFor a hit of pure escapism, start with the opening title track: a dynamic barnburner reminding us that sometimes the warts in life are the best part. “Marshall felt particularly passionate that we open with that,” reflects Shepherd. “It’s got the high energy, the rocking guitar, the heavy blues influence – but it sounds incredibly modern at the same time. As for the lyric, it’s about how social media has created this unrealistic expectation, showing everybody how perfect our lives are, when a lot of it is just a façade, y’know?”\nWhile Shepherd has spread the word of the blues founding fathers from the start, the modern sound of highlights like Sweet & Low and Best Of Times speaks to an artist with his antennae up. “When it comes to the lyrics, Sweet & Low is an old-fashioned courting ritual, a guy pursuing a girl,” he explains. “But really that song is about the groove and making people want to get down. There’s the urban influence, the blues influence, the rock influence, but it all comes together and gets people’s attention right off the bat. People I’ve played the album for, they consistently have the biggest reaction to that one.”\n“To me,” he continues, “Best Of Times is an observation of the modern-day blues experience. We recently played a show in a really rough, depressed part of the country, but you could tell the community was all in it together, and Marshall and I wrote that song as a result of going through town. Y’know, ‘Grandma standing in the welfare line/Mom and Dad working overtime/bills to pay, mouths to feed…’”\nAs for the guitar community that follows Shepherd’s every move, the fire and soul across this track listing should more than satisfy. “I really like the lead guitar tone from Man On A Mission,” he says. “Then there’s Bad Intentions. I guess that song is like Muddy Waters’ I’m A Man, the guy pounding on his chest, talking about how badass he is. So the guitar tone is really ripping and aggressive, right on the edge, with a lot of hair. I mostly used my favorite ’61 Strat, but when I go in the studio, I have no idea what I’m gonna play – and I just play whatever happens.”\nAnd finally, as befitted this most playful album sessions, Shepherd dipped into his mental jukebox for a rabble-rousing cover of Elton John’s Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting. “I always keep a catalog in the back of my mind of songs I think my band could bring our things to. The timing worked out well because Elton is doing his farewell tour. Also, I love his guitar player, Davey Johnstone. He’s a friend, too, and when we recorded that song, I sent him a message saying, ‘Hey man, we’re gonna cover Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting – I hope I don’t screw up your guitar parts’. I almost asked Davey to come into the studio and play it, so that I knew it was 100 percent correct!”\nBut then, as he says, perfection is overrated. At a time when mainstream music is polished, quantized and airbrushed of soul, Dirt On My Diamonds sees Kenny Wayne Shepherd catch shards of honest human emotion and serve them up raw for an audience that needs real music more than ever. “I just feel a responsibility to make the best music I can make,” he concludes. “And I’m really excited to see what’s gonna happen with these songs when we take them out on the road…”\nTickets: $55.75, $69.75, $99",
