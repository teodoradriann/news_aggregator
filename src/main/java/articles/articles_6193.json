    "title": "AIADMK condemns Annamalai’s ‘Jayalalithaa is a Hindutva icon’ remark | Chennai News - Times of India",
    "text": "CHENNAI/MADURAI: AIADMK on Saturday strongly criticized BJP state president K Annamalai’s remarks that late chief minister J Jayalalithaa was a “far superior” Hindutva leader. V K Sasikala, a close aide of Jayalalithaa hit out at Annamalai, saying that his reference to the late CM showed his ignorance and misunderstanding of her.In a statement released by the AIADMK headquarters, former minister and senior party functionary D Jayakumar criticised Annamalai for trying to portray Jayalalithaa solely as a Hindu and tarnish her reputation for “his own political gain and fame” in Tamil Nadu. He said Jayalalithaa transcended caste and religion, and showed respect to everyone. “She was uncompromisingly committed to protecting people of all religions and respecting their beliefs. As long as Tamil Nadu politics exists, Jayalalithaa's reputation as a leader for all will remain,” Jayakumar said.In an interview with PTI, Annamalai said Jayalalithaa was the first politician in the country, apart from BJP leaders, to endorse the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and implement an anti-conversion law in Tamil Nadu in 2002-03. Jayakumar recalled the programmes that Jayalalithaa launched during her tenure in office, including ‘Annadhanam’ in temples. She initiated a scheme to provide free rice to mosques for making gruel during the holy month of Ramzan. The former chief minister also introduced government financial aid for Christians to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.Demolition of Babri Masjid led to violence in other states, but Jayalalithaa ensured there was no violence in TN and made it a haven of peace, Jayakumar said.In Madurai, former minister R B Udhayakumar alleged that Annamalai's remarks were politically motivated. “He could instead become a member of the AIADMK if he wants to adopt the principles of Amma,” he said, asking Annamalai to praise BJP leaders like Vajpayee, Advani or even Savarkar if he wanted to attract people’s attention.Sasikala said Jayalalithaa was a remarkable leader, earning respect and admiration of individuals of diverse backgrounds, regardless of caste or religion. She remained a true Dravidian leader until her passing, continuing the legacy of former chief ministers C N Annadurai and M G Ramachandran. “It is a well-known fact that she believed in God. But she never had religious faith. She was a leader who consistently treated everyone equally throughout her life,” said Sasikala.",

    "title": "PM Modi recalls \"profound sacrifice\" of Jesus Christ on Good Friday",
    "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the profound sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Good Friday and said that it teaches everyone lessons of compassion and forgiveness. \"Today, on Good Friday, we remember the profound sacrifice of Jesus Christ. May everyone find strength in the lessons of compassion and forgiveness it teaches us,\" Prime Minister Modi posted on X. The solemn occasion of Good Friday is being marked by prayers and processions depicting the 'stations of the cross' across the nation. In Kerala, devotees carry wooden crosses depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ during the procession to Saint Joseph's Cathedral in Palayam. Commemorating the crucifixion of Christ, Good Friday services are being held in churches across the state on the day, marking the countdown to Easter Sunday. Prayers were also offered at the Sacred Heart Cathedral Church in the national capital. Father Jolly from the CBCI Centre, Catholic Bishops Conference of India, Headquarters in Delhi, elucidated the significance of 'Good Friday' for Christians. Speaking to ANI, Father Jolly said, \"On Good Friday, Christians all over the world remember the passion and death of our blessed lord Jesus Christ. This is a memorial day for us to journey with the suffering and death of Christ on the cross. By keeping this memorial, we sanctify ourselves, our households and purify our hearts and minds to join our lives with the life of Christ,\" he said. \"We read the passages from the sacred scriptures that speak about the sufferings and death of our blessed lord Jesus on Good Friday. We also meditate on the sufferings of Christ and venerate the cross today,\" he said. In Thiruvananthapuram, devotees took part in the 'stations of the cross' procession to Saint Joseph's Cathedral in Palayam. People of the Christian community also took out a procession from the Mother House to Saint Teresa's Church in Kolkata and offered prayers in the church to celebrate the Good Friday. The 'stations of the cross' mark Christ's suffering as he was crucified on Good Friday. The story behind 'Good Friday' is about the day when Jesus was crucified by Romans. A disciple of Jesus, Judas betrayed him, which led to his capture by the Romans. The Governor of the Roman province of Judea at the time, Pontius Pilate, ordered the execution of Jesus. Jesus was made to carry his cross through Jerusalem to the place of crucifixion known as Calvary. The day of 'Good Friday' is followed by the celebration known as 'Easter', which refers to the event of the resurrection of Jesus on the third day of his crucifixion. Read More",

    "text": "Handheld gaming consoles are no longer dominated by Nintendo; PC games are entering the handheld industry with competition from Valve and ASUS. Valve’s [Steam Deck](https://lifehacker.com/why-the-steam-deck-is-still-a-good-buy-in-2023-1850776190) was the best budget option available until ASUS released the [ASUS ROG Ally Z1](https://lifehacker.com/asus-rog-ally-z1-review-1850976924) earlier this summer, which is the budget version of the more powerful [ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme](https://zdcs.link/Zobnv?pageview_type=Standard&template=article&module=content-body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ASUS%20ROG%20Ally%20Z1%20Extreme&short_url=Zobnv&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fentertainment%2Fasus-rog-ally-sale-at-best-buy). And now, the ASUS ROG Ally Z1 has become a bit more budget-friendly after another deal from Best Buy: You can get the [Asus ROG Ally Z1 for $399.99](https://zdcs.link/OyeXn?pageview_type=Standard&template=article&module=content-body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Asus%20ROG%20Ally%20Z1%20for%20%24399.99&short_url=OyeXn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fentertainment%2Fasus-rog-ally-sale-at-best-buy) (originally $599.99) again, matching the lowest price I've seen yet, which it hit after Cyber Monday. A great budget option for PC gamers on-the-go The ASUS ROG Ally Z1 is a great option for PC gamers who are used to the Windows system and want a budget-friendly way to play their games. The ASUS ROG Ally Z1 is cheaper than budget gaming laptops and the Extreme version, although its processing power and graphics are limited. You can see whether the [budget version or the Z1 Extreme is better for you here](https://lifehacker.com/asus-rog-ally-z1-versus-z1-extreme-comparison-1850981011). Don’t expect to play every AAA smoothly without having some kind of problem. For most big AAA games, you will need a full-sized desktop or gaming laptop to run without hiccups. While you can play some on the ASUS ROG Ally Z1, you will have to accept playing with lower frames per second to make them run (our readers claim to be able to play AAA games at 60FPS without issues). If you’re not familiar with the Windows 11 operating system, this can be tricky to do. The ASUS ROG Ally Z1 brings you 512GB of memory with a micro SD memory card slot if you want to expand it, an AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB RAM, and a seven-inch touchscreen LED with a maximum video resolution of 1080p. The rechargeable battery will give you about eight and a half hours of battery time. You can read the full [PCMag review of the ASUS ROG Ally Z1 here](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-ally). While the ASUS ROG Ally is not objectively better or worse than the Steam Deck, at its current price, the Ally Z1 can be a better option than the Steam Deck for most people.",

Considerado ofensivo, o personagem\nLiver Lips McGrowl foi eliminado da apresentação que leva pouco mais de 15 minutos, de acordo com o Adoro Cinema .\nO nome é inspirado nos crooners que marcaram os anos 1960 e o personagem tinha lábios muito grandes. Mas o motivo para ser ofensivo é outro. Em inglês, liver lips é uma consequência do consumo excessivo de álcool ou de doenças hepáticas.\nRetirado em setembro de 2023 da apresentação, Liver Lips McGrowl deu lugar a Romeo McGrowl no Disneyworld. Em\nTóquio, ainda não existe essa reformulação.\nBeary e os Ursos Caipiras estreou em outubro de 1971 e fez sucesso imediato com a ideia de ursos que tocaram música country. Anos depois, eles ganharam um especial de Natal nos parques e chegaram a ter um filme lançado em 2002.\nVeja o trailer do filme em inglês:",

    "text": "Stanley Subaru donates over $24,000 to Hospice Volunteers of Hancock County ELLSWORTH, Maine (WABI) - On Thursday, Stanley Subaru presented a check worth $24,250 to Hospice Volunteers of Hancock County. The donation is part of the Stanley Subaru ‘Share the Love’ Subaru Program. The Share the Love event takes place every year from the middle of November to early January. During that time Subaru of America as well as Stanley Subaru donate a portion of the proceeds from each new car sale. The money will go towards a Hospice organization that is predominantly run by volunteers. “I was just about in tears. We’re a small organization. And so it really does impact our organization and the people that we serve. I was really blown away and working with the folks at Subaru, they’re amazing and they’ve been really a lot of fun to work with,” said Kathy Baillargeon, the executive director at Hospice Volunteers of Hancock County. “There’s no hurdles or guidelines to be eligible for their services. They are actually available to everybody. Quality of life, health, end of life services, all of those things are things that touch everyone in our community. They have such a broad reach within our community. They were a natural fit,” said Mark Politte, the owner of Stanley Subaru. Over the last 16 years Subaru has donated $288 million to national and local charities across the country. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
