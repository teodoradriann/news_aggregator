The company’s financial results show that in the three months to the end of September it posted a net loss of 84 million euros, or 7 cents per share, compared to a profit of 753 million euros, or 57 cents per share, in the same period . period of last year.\nProfit from continuing operations fell to 384 million euros, or 29 cents a share, from 748 million euros, or 57 cents a share, last year. Adjusted earnings excluding non-recurring items fell to 49 cents per share. Operating profit fell to 473 million euros from 912 million euros last year, and revenue fell to 3.92 billion euros from 4.15 billion euros a year ago.\nFor the entire year, turnover decreased by 8% to 14.96 billion euros. The company said it plans to propose an annual dividend of 35 cents per share, the same as last year.\nLooking ahead, CEO Jochen Hanebeck said the company currently sees almost no growth momentum in its end markets, with the exception of artificial intelligence.\nHe also noted that short-term patterns in orders and inventory spending are clouding the outlook for demand trends. A “subdued” return is therefore expected for the new financial year due to weak demand in its end markets.\nDon’t neglect it\nJapan does not want to be left behind. It will invest a huge sum in supporting the chip industry",

    "text": "Last Updated Jetting off to a warm, relaxing getaway in the middle of winter doesn’t always mean having to go somewhere remote where flight prices alone can set you back thousands of dollars. Even now that temperatures across the country are dropping like never before, there’s no shortage of gorgeous sunny destinations to explore right here in the U.S., and that’s exactly what [Kayak’s](https://www.kayak.com/news/warm-places-to-visit-in-february/) ranking of “Top Warm Places To Visit In February” just confirmed. The list, compiled based on the company’s independently collected data, featured three stunning domestic destinations, perfect for those looking to escape the winter blues without having to book an expensive international flight. Fort Lauderdale, Florida With average February temperatures of 69°F (20.5°C) and an impressive 12 hours of daylight, [Fort Lauderdale, Florida](https://www.traveloffpath.com/top-3-u-s-beach-destinations-for-an-affordable-winter-getaway/) remains one of America’s favorite beachy destinations year-round. People have always flocked to the city for its sun-soaked beaches and electrifying atmosphere, but its reputation as a party hotspot more popular among spring breakers has always held the Floridian hub back a bit in terms of its tourism success. Now, though, travelers seem to be rediscovering Fort Lauderdale as a well-rounded destination suited to virtually every type of traveler, from college kids just looking to have fun to families seeking some well-deserved relaxation. Often called the “Venice of America,” Fort Lauderdale boasts an impressive canal network, which visitors can explore firsthand through organized boat tours that start at $38 per adult. If taking in the views of the golden-sanded beaches from afar isn’t enough to get you out of that wintery mindset, take the time to actually lounge around the iconic Fort Lauderdale Beach, lined with palm trees and trendy cafes that make that mid-day snack feel like the escape you’ve been pining after for so long. Beyond its breathtaking views, the city is home to more art galleries, museums, and theaters than you can count, and the ultimate playground for those of you looking to experience the city’s underrated culture once the sun sets. Las Olas Boulevard, lined with boutiques, art galleries, and high-end restaurants, adds that final touch of classic city charm to the overall experience. O’ahu, Hawaii Home to crystal-clear waters, pristine sands, and what many would consider to be the quintessential island culture, the 50th U.S. state makes its (expected) appearance in yet another “Best Warm North American Destinations” list. This time, Hawaii’s proud representative is O’ahu, an island famous for its other-worldly views and postcard-looking beaches, of which Waikiki is arguably the most famous. Between the white-sanded shores, deep green rainforests, and volcanic craters, O’ahu presents such a diverse array of landscapes that you’re bound to feel a little overwhelmed. Those who don’t want to sit around and take in the pretty views all day will have a lot to do, too. Surfing enthusiasts can catch waves in the birthplace of modern surfing, while those seeking some good ol’ relaxation can bask in the warmth of the tropical sun. If you’re more of a history buff, you’ll get the chance to interact firsthand with the region’s storied past. Here, you can visit Pearl Harbor and pay homage to the events of December 7, 1941, explore the Polynesian Cultural Center, or make the (very worthwhile) trip to the stunning Byodo-In Temple. Whatever’s on your itinerary, one thing’s for sure – the warm weather with temperatures that average 70°F (21°C) throughout February is sure to make an already-great vacation that much better. Tucson, Arizona While not your typical beachy getaway, Tucson, Arizona offers the type of mild climate and jaw-dropping views that most of us are seeking this winter. Average daytime temperatures here tend to stay on the lower end of what you’d consider “warm,” ranging from 60-70°F (15-21°C); however, considering that rainfall is minimal to non-existent and that you’re not planning on swimming or sunbathing either way, that’s pretty much perfect. Thanks to its location in the famous Sonoran Desert, Tucson in February becomes the perfect place for you to explore the sandy landscapes without having to fight the scorching summer heat. With gorgeous, wild attractions like the Saguaro National Park and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the city’s surroundings are the ultimate playground for outdoor enthusiasts. On the other hand, city trippers will have the time of their lives exploring Tucson’s many cultural attractions, including (but not limited to) Mission San Xavier del Bac, the Old Tucson Studios, and the Tucson Museum of Art and Historic Block.

    "title": "Motorhead Share Video of Lemmy Forever Tribute From Wacken Festival - 2023 In Review",
    "text": "Motorhead Share Video of Lemmy Forever Tribute From Wacken Festival was a top 23 story of Aug 2023: (Adrenaline) On August 2nd, 2023, a giant tribute to Motorhead's Ian 'Lemmy' Kilmister took place, featuring a parade, communal toasts, and the enshrinement of his ashes at Lemmy's Bar in the village of Wacken. Despite wretched weather conditions, nothing could derail the thunderous celebrations, which saw band members Phil Campbell and Mikkey Dee participate in an afternoon parade featuring several giant floats carrying hundreds of loud and raucous Motorhead fans. The proceedings started at the festival site and headed through the town of Wacken to Lemmy's Bar, where hordes of fans were waiting for the enshrinement ceremony, which saw Phil and Mikkey place Lemmy's ashes, which are contained in a smaller version of his custom urn, in a specially-prepared glass display next to his personal items including his hat, boots, bass guitar, and Marshall stack. Fans were also treated to a re-enacted version of Lemmy's Dressing Room, which contained all his favorite things such as books, newspapers, whiskey, of course, and even his beloved Kinder Eggs with a toy, and the building itself was adorned with various Motorhead-themed murals, including one of Lemmy himself. Later, at night onstage, headlining rocker Doro (an old friend of Lemmy's) was joined on stage by Phil and Mikkey for \"Love Me Forever\" and \"Ace Of Spades,\" which saw the crowd go crazy and underscore the enormous presence Lemmy carries as an immortal man of the people. As the band played \"Ace of Spades\" a flurry of drones flew above the stage forming Doro's logo, Lemmy's face, and the Lemmy & Wacken Forever logo. Throughout the day (and doubtless into the remaining days of the festival), toasts were raised in Lemmy's name. \"Lemmy loved playing Wacken; there was a long relationship as we played for the first time in 1997 and returned many, many times,\" said Mikkey Dee. \"It is quite natural that he is returning now and has another place forever.\" \"It's great that Lemmy will be at Wacken forever among such good friends,\" said Phil Campbell. \"And I'm glad there's another home where people can raise a toast to him.\" The Lemmy Forever at Wacken celebration was part of a wider movement that started at last year's Hellfest, and sees Lemmy enshrined and celebrated at select spots around the world, which he loved and allowing fans a place to gather, remember, and honor him.

    "text": "La Fiscalía de Sonora realizó la imputación formal en contra de Jesús Guillermo “N”, de 23 años, quien es acusado del feminicidio de la señora Ana Obdulia “N”, de 63 años, ocurrido en la ciudad fronteriza de Nogales.\nSegún la carpeta de investigación, Jesús Guillermo, aprovechándose que Ana Obdulia vivía en situación de indefensión en su casa de la colonia Jardines del Bosque, ubicada en la zona Poniente de la ciudad de Nogales, entró para agredirla de manera directa y violenta.\nLos hechos ocurrieron a las 17:52 horas del pasado jueves 3 de abril, cuando el sujeto primero sometió físicamente a la mujer, luego se presume que la asfixió con sus manos, y posteriormente utilizó un arma blanca para provocar múltiples lesiones en cuello y tórax, que le causaron la muerte.\nLuego de 24 horas, elementos de la Agencia Ministerial de Investigación Criminal (AMIC), detuvo a Jesús Guillermo, por haber cometido otros delitos, y fue hasta el siete de abril que se emitió y cumplió la orden de aprehensión en su contra, ya en estando en reclusión, ahora por el delito de feminicidio.\nEl implicado fue trasladado al Cereso de Nogales\nPosteriormente se realizó la audiencia inicial, donde los agentes del Ministerio Público formularon la imputación correspondiente y solicitaron la vinculación a proceso, sin embargo, la defensa solicitó extender el plazo por 144 horas.\nAdemás, la defensa solicitó una valoración psiquiátrica del imputado, sin embargo, fue declarada improcedente por el Juez, al existir un dictamen médico que acredita su adecuada orientación neurológica y porque no se corrió traslado previo. De momento, Jesús Guillermo permanecerá internado dentro del Centro de Reinserción Social (Cereso) de Nogales, esperando que se lleve a cabo la resolución judicial de su caso.\nAnte esto, la Fiscalía de Sonora aseguró que seguirán buscando la justicia para las víctimas y sus familias, por lo cual solicitarán la mayor pena que conforme a derecho procesal, garantizando el acceso a la justicia con perspectiva de género.",
