Météo France évoque un \"épisode caniculaire de relativement courte durée mais particulièrement intense\". Limiter les activités sportives Pour faire face à cet épisode, il est notamment conseillé de boire de l'eau plusieurs fois par jour, d'éviter de sortir aux heures les plus chaudes de la journée, de limiter les activités sportives et physiques. A Marseille, les piscines municipales sont gratuites tandis qu'à Nice les agents municipaux mènent des tournées téléphoniques pour s'assurer du bien-être des personnes âgées ou isolées. \"Les vagues de chaleur sont une manifestation emblématique de notre changement climatique, elles sont de plus en plus intenses, fréquentes, précoces et longues.\" Matthieu Sorel (climatologue ) En France, on observait avant 1989 \"en moyenne une vague de chaleur tous les cinq ans\", alors que \"depuis 2000 elles se produisent à une fréquence annuelle\". Ces vagues de chaleur, prévient le spécialiste, \"seront deux fois plus nombreuses d'ici 30 ans\". Avec AFP",

    "text": "Second arrest revealed in deadly Hanover party shooting The sheriff’s office says they charged Jayvian Marrece Threatt, 18, of Petersburg, with attempted murder. HANOVER, Va. (WWBT) -The Hanover County Sheriff’s Office has released the name of a second suspect they’ve charged in connection with the fallout from a deadly party. The sheriff’s office says they’ve arrested and charged Jayvian Marrece Threatt, 18, of Petersburg, with attempted murder. Investigators say that charge and a second-degree gun charge are for shooting at James Smith. Smith, 18, of Ashland, was arrested on Tuesday, April 23 and charged with the murder of Matthew Devine, 16, of Colonial Heights. He’s now behind bars. On April 6, just after 10:45 p.m., sheriff’s deputies responded to the 6000 block of McClellan Road for a parking complaint related to a large party. When they arrived, deputies were made aware of a shooting and found Devine dead. Deputies also tell 12 On Your Side that Threatt arrived at the party with Devine. The sheriff’s office said Threatt was arrested on April 14. They say they first held off on identifying him “to avoid jeopardizing the ongoing investigation.” 12 On Your Side is also learning what may have happened the night Matthew was killed. According to search warrants from Hanover Circuit Court, Matthew Devine attended the party with a friend. We learned from his family his older brother was also with him. Court documents say Matthew bumped into an unknown suspect, now known to be Smith. Words were exchanged, and then Smith allegedly flashed a gun at Matthew. Documents say Matthew was also carrying a weapon and followed Smith outside. The two met in the driveway of the home where the party was happening. Shots were fired, Matthew was hit in the chest, and Smith ran away. “I don’t know too much. I know the detectives said he may have had a weapon on him,” Ashley Devine, Matthew’s mom, said, “Like I said, I am not trying to make this ordeal like Matthew was a saint by no means.” Right now, it’s unclear how many people were in the driveway with Smith, Devine and Threatt. Devine says she got the call from her other son at 10:59 p.m. that Matthew had been shot, not long after Matthew died in his brother’s arms. “What I am saying is that Matthew did not deserve to get murdered the way he did,” Ashley said. According to the search warrant, deputies did not find any guns in the immediate area, and a weapon was not found on Matthew’s person. “Per the law officers, he did not fire the firearm. That part is very important to me,” said Devine. The Hanover Sheriff’s office confirmed with 12 On Your Side there is no evidence that Matthew fired a gun. Officials say this case is still “very much active.” Anyone with information can call Sergeant Thomas Claytor with the Hanover County Sheriff’s Office at (804) 839-2854 or the Metro Richmond Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000.

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "text": "A prominent Hindu temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in the US state of California and the police are investigating the matter as a possible hate crime. The City of Newark Police Department in Newark, Newark, California told PTI in an emailed statement that on Friday at approximately 8:35 am, they received a report of graffiti at the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple. Officers responded and met with temple leaders who described the vandalism as meant to intimidate them. “Based on the content of the graffiti it is believed that the defacement was a targeted act, and the vandalism is being investigated as a possible hate crime,” the statement said. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco strongly condemned the defacing of the temple. “We strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti,” the Consulate posted on X. “This incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in this matter,” the Consulate said. According to images posted on social media, the word ‘Khalistan’ was spray-painted on a signpost outside the temple along with other objectionable graffiti. Newark police further said that any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority. “Officers are investigating, collecting evidence, and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses in order to establish the chain of events and bring those responsible to justice,” the police said. The department said that “we stand united with our community and are urging community members with any information regarding this incident to come forward and speak with investigators.” The police are asking anyone with information regarding this investigation to contact the Newark Police Investigations Unit. This is not the first instance where a temple has been defaced with such graffiti in the recent past by Khalistani separatists. India has been asking its partner countries such as Canada, the UK and the US to not give space to \"extremist Khalistani ideology\". Khalistan supporters have increased their anti-India activities after the death of Canada-based Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India's consulate in San Francisco in July came under an attack from Khalistan supporters who tried to set the diplomatic facility on fire. The vandalism of the temple in Newark came close on the heels of allegations of an Indian official's involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate a separatist Sikh leader in the US. The Indian official has been linked by American prosecutors to an individual accused of conspiring to assassinate Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States. India has expressed concern over the matter and stated that appropriate action will be taken following the conclusions of an investigative panel examining the allegations. Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by The Telegraph Online staff and has been published from a syndicated feed.",

    "text": "The recent commissioning and handing over of the 1.2km Idye River Basin erosion control/hydraulic drainage project in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Sen. George Akume has sparked jubilation from residents, especially victims of Makurdi’s perennial flooding who have lost family members, homes, farmlands and properties year in and year out.\nThe National Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (N-HYPPADEC) constructed the drainage to end the Perennial flooding witnessed by some communities, especially Makurdi, the State capital.\nThe State, located in the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria and known as the food basket of the nation, occupies a land mass of 32,518 sqkm within the Lower Benue River Basin in the middle belt region of Nigeria.\nIt has a tropical, subtropical climate with two distinct seasons: wet and dry. The wet season usually lasts about eight months between April and October, while the dry season lasts from November to March. However, due to recent climate change, the seasons are not certain again.\nThe seven months of rainfall are usually the most devastating and destructive season, as residents of the State witness, as most parts of the local government areas, especially Makurdi, are faced with severe flooding.\nHowever, citizens of the State, who are predominantly farmers, rely solely on agriculture as the main source of their livelihood; the heavy downpour leading to the spilling of River Benue over its banks, as well as poor drainage channels and poor maintenance and refuse dump by residents often lead to blockage of the few available drainages whenever it rains leaving citizens at the mercy of God every rainy season.\nSome of the flood victims who spoke to our correspondent, including Moses Liamkuma, Bundepuun Orseer, Joseph Adzuanongo and Ehi Adejoh, commended the State and FG Government for coming to the plight of flood victims with a sustainable initiative that will put an end to the perennial flooding they experience every year, adding that the project will go a long way in addressing flood issue in the State\nThey all blamed lack of political will on the part of the government to mitigate the sustained flooding and poor awareness creation on the dangers of flooding for residents to stop some harmful practices like dumpling refuse in drainages, among others\nAccording to them, “the environmental effects of flooding, which include destruction of farmlands, houses, properties and displacement of communities also bring about health challenges and in some cases loss of human lives.”\nImportantly, the Secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Sen. George Akume, on the 6th of June 2024, commissioned and handed over to the State Government the Idye Flood Control/Dyke Project, aimed at reversing the environmental destruction caused by floods and erosion in Makurdi the State capital.\nRepresented by the minister for Water Resources and Environment, Sen. AKume commended the National Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (N-HYPPADEC) for its efforts to promote sustainable community development in riverine areas impacted by hydropower dams.\nAccording to him, the completed 1.2km dyke project is the first step to addressing the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by communities in the State\nThe completion of this project is a significant milestone in the efforts by N-HYPPADEC to mitigate the devastating effects of floods and erosion in Benue State, and this will go a long way in alleviating the plight of victims of the perennial flooding in the State\n“I want to commend HYPPADEC for their hard work and collaboration, which has made this project a reality. From what I have seen, this project will stand a taste of time and will have a lasting solution and impact that will improve the standard of living of members of the flooding communities.\nThe SGF also informed that the Federal government would soon commence the construction of dams across the country to mitigate the devastating effects of flooding on Nigerian communities\n“My office recognises the importance of a healthy and green environment for the country’s development, which is why agencies such as N-HYPPADEC are placed directly under my supervision to achieve maximum effects.\nAkume enjoined Benue communities, particularly the Idye community, which is a direct beneficiary of drainage, to take ownership of the project by sustaining its maintenance and ensuring preservation for the collective good of society.\nThe managing director of the National Hydro-Electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (N-HYPPADEC), Abubakar Yelwa, who was also at the commissioning, disclosed that statistics from the Benue State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) show that in 2022 alone, about 18,349 houses and farmlands were destroyed by floods.\nYelwa lamented that the devastating floods displaced over 134,797 persons in the same year.\nHe said, “The project is also supplemented by an additional 2.5 kilometres of excavation to salvage the community’s lower basin, and it is a significant investment of approximately N1.2bn.\nThe MD maintained that for years, residents of Makurdi and other parts of the state had endured annual flooding that consumed thousands of homes and farmlands, displacing numerous families. The commissioning of the project marks a significant stride in our collective efforts to mitigate the devastating impact of flooding and erosion that have long plagued Makurdi communities.\nHe said successive governments at both federal and state levels had made frantic efforts to manage this crisis and mitigate its impact on the people and the environment. For example, the federal government spent about N700 million on the Idye Basin flood control project in Makurdi.\nDespite these efforts, floods and erosion have persisted in many parts of the State whenever heavy rainfall occurs. This shows the gravity of the problem and suggests that the problem can only be solved through a series of sustained projects.”\n“Today , we stand to celebrate the completion of one of the contributions of the Federal Government through the National Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (N-HYPPADEC) by commissioning the Idye Flood Control/Dyke Project, which spans an impressive 1.2 kilometers”\nWhile commending President Bola Tinubu, for his support and commitment to community development, the MD attributed the successful execution of the project to the collaboration, innovation and determination of the Benue State Government, traditional rulers, community members and the diligent efforts of our dedicated staff and extend the commission’s gratitude to its partners, Insigne Experts Ltd. & Truetech Engineering Consult and Services Ltd., whose expertise and commitment he said has been integral to the success of this project.\nIn his remarks, Benue State Governor Hyacinth Alia said environmental challenges have threatened not only the state’s agricultural productivity but also the safety of the people.\n“I want to say here that the Idye flood control/dyke project is not just a necessity but a beacon of hope for Benue communities who have been the victims of the perennial flooding.\nHe said, “Benue will continue to present additional proposals to expand the scope of N-HYPPADEC activities to ease these challenges in the affected rural communities.”\nRepresented by the deputy governor, Sam Odeh, the Governor pointed out that the Benue State Government consistently played a significant role in supervising and ensuring the project’s standard and will remain committed to providing technical expertise and support to ensure the project’s sustainability.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Benue State, Odeh commended President Tinubu for the project and other good things enjoyed by the state and assured the FG of synergy for a better tomorrow.\nEarlier, the former Chairman of the Governing Council of HYPPADEC Terfa Ityav, who commended the FG, the Benue State Government, and all those whose collaborative efforts had helped ensure the completion of the project, expressed optimism that the drainage will go a long way in curbing the perennial flooding suffered by the Idye and other neighbouring communities.",
