    "title": "Djokovic diz ter sido envenenado por meio da comida durante entrevero na Austrália",
    "text": "Às vésperas do início de mais um Aberto da Austrália, o primeiro Grand Slam de tênis do ano tem voltado à tona a polêmica que envolveu Novak Djokovic antes da edição de 2022 do torneio. Naquele ano, em meio à pandemia de covid-19, o sérvio foi mantido sob confinamento durante alguns dias ao chegar à Austrália para a disputa da competição e acabou impedido de jogar e expulso do país por não ter sido vacinado.\nAgora, em entrevista à revista GQ, Djokovic alegou que foi envenenado por meio da comida servida no hotel em que ficou confinado na época, em Melbourne. \"Tive alguns problemas de saúde. E percebi que naquele hotel em Melbourne fui alimentado com uma comida que me envenenou.\"\n\"Fiz algumas descobertas quando voltei para a Sérvia. Eu nunca contei isso para ninguém publicamente, mas descobri que eu tinha um nível de metal pesado muito alto. Eu tinha chumbo, um nível muito alto de chumbo e mercúrio\", relatou o tenista.\nDjokovic diz ter ficado muito doente após aquele período, sendo atendido por uma equipe médica de emergência em casa. \"Era como uma gripe, apenas uma simples gripe. Mas, dias depois, uma simples gripe me derrubou muito. Tive isso várias vezes e depois tive que fazer (testes) toxicológicos.\"\nContactado pela revista, o Departamento de Assuntos Internos da Austrália declarou que \"por razões de privacidade, o Departamento não pode comentar casos individuais.\"\nDJOKOVIC NÃO SE VACINOU CONTRA COVID: 'SOU UMA PESSOA SAUDÁVEL'\nQuestionado se recebeu a vacina contra covid depois de todo o entrevero, Djokovic não esconde que não foi vacinado. \"Não, não. Porque não sinto que precisava. Sou uma pessoa saudável, cuido do meu corpo, cuido das minhas necessidades de saúde e sou atleta profissional. E por ser atleta profissional, estou extremamente atento ao que consumo, e faço exames regulares, exames de sangue, qualquer tipo de exame. Eu sei exatamente o que está acontecendo. Então não senti necessidade de fazer isso. Além disso, o que é importante afirmar é saber que não sou uma ameaça para ninguém. E eu não era. Porque eu tinha anticorpos.\"\n\"Eu não sou pró-vacina. Eu não sou antivacina. Sou pró-liberdade de escolher o que é certo para você e seu corpo. Então, quando alguém tira o meu direito de escolher o que devo tomar para o meu corpo, não acho que isso seja correto.\"\nA chave principal do Aberto da Austrália começa no próximo sábado, 11 de janeiro, e terá a participação de quatro brasileiros: Bia Haddad entre as mulheres e João Fonseca, Thiago Wild e Thiago Monteiro entre os homens. Djokovic, que é o maior campeão do torneio e de Grand Slams da história, vai em busca da sua 11ª taça da competição australiana e do seu 25º Grand Slam.",

    "text": "长沙招投标，机器“裁判长”履职表现亮眼！\n近日，长沙公共资源交易中心大楼，浏阳一标的为4421万元的水利工程项目开标，全国160家企业投标，以前至少需要2天，现在通过机器管招投标系统，8小时就能完成，高效高质让专家评委更轻松。\n今年2月，机器管招投标系统在全省试运行，长沙市通过该系统累计发布招标计划122宗、招标公告26宗，完成交易14宗，推动招投标领域从“人工参与”向“数智规则”转型。\n投标文件制作效率提升约50倍\n招投标工作是展示营商环境的重要窗口。2024年12月，我省大刀阔斧对公共资源交易领域突出问题进行整治，启动机器管招投标系统改革。\n该系统为全省统一、省建市用，目前涵盖工业、住建、交通、水利、环境、农田、自然资源等行业的各类工程建设项目，对招投标领域进行全方位智能化升级、全流程重塑。\n业内专家称，这套系统有两个方面的突出特点：前端模板化，搭建统一招标文件范本，只需填写关键信息，即可一键生成，原本制作投标文件需要3至7天时间，如今缩短为1至4小时，效率提升约50倍；终端智能化，通过人工智能技术和大数据分析，对标书客观部分进行高效识别，精准筛选关键信息。\n全新系统加持，长沙招投标流程更优化，效能进一步提升。目前长沙机器管招投标试点项目，评标时长大多在5小时内，长沙智谷光年项目A61地块供水工程（第二次）等2宗项目评标仅用2小时，效率大大提高。\n高效公正找到“最优解”\n机器究竟如何评标？\n参与项目评标的专家说，系统好比安装了火眼金睛，能迅速锁定关键信息，如某项目经理名下有多个在建项目、某公司安全资质证书已到期，从而辅助专家快速淘汰不符合要求的投标单位。\n机器对客观部分进行评审后，系统对技术标采用乱序盲评，对报价采用“六随机五区间”计算比对，严防“钻空子”，确保高效公正找到“最优解”。\n长沙公共资源交易中心还组建机器管招投标评审监测调度小组，对招投标活动中的每一个环节进行实时监控和记录，实现通透式运行、浸透式交互、穿透式监管。\n不见面开标、专家复核、监测调度小组全程监测，大大提升了招投标全流程效率，从根源上解决公共资源交易领域“打牌子”“提篮子”等腐败易发频发、市场准入隐性壁垒等问题。\n市场竞争促进生态优化\n记者了解到，机器管招投标改革实施以来，参与投标企业数量更多、上升明显，全省乃至全国的优秀企业踊跃参与长沙招投标市场。中南大学湘雅二医院某施工项目，多达53家企业参与投标；长沙市工人文化宫原址新建项目某工程，省外企业参与投标比例占35.71%，竞争得到充分激发，市场生态得到持续优化。\n长沙公共资源交易中心相关负责人介绍，机器管招投标，减少了评标专家评标自由裁量权，不仅有效防范“打招呼”或“萝卜招标”，还实现项目评审节资、实施零投诉。目前，机器管招投标系统评审中标项目节资效果显著，试点项目平均节资率为14.95%。",

    "text": "ALBANY, Ore. – A woman who allegedly shot her boyfriend in the head during a domestic incident was arrested and jailed early on Thursday morning, according to the Albany Police Department. Albany police officials said they responded at about 2:13 a.m. on January 25 to a 911 call in the 600 block of 34th Avenue SE. The 911 caller told police that his roommate’s girlfriend, identified as Hami W. Lee, 24, shot his roommate in the head, authorities said. Police said that responding police officers arrived and found a victim with a gunshot wound near the front door of the home. First responders with the Albany Fire Department arrived and performed life-saving measures before the victim, identified as a 30-year-old Albany man, was transported to Good Samaritan Medical Center in Corvallis, authorities said. Police said Lee was cooperative with investigators at the scene and was later arrested and taken into custody. Lee faces charges of second-degree assault, menacing, and unlawful use of a weapon, police said. Albany police officials ask anyone with information related to this incident contact the Albany Police Department’s detective unit at 541-917-7688 and reference case number 24-00473.",

    "title": "Putin’s silence: Why is he traveling in the Caucasus while the Ukrainian Army advances deep into Russia?",
    "text": "Putin reacts to Ukrainian Forces’ Invasion of Kursk?\nBy Alexander Zhelenin, originally published on the Republic website\nThe situation in the Kursk theater of military operations is becoming increasingly humiliating for Putin . According to the latest information from the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Alexander Syrsky, Ukrainian troops now control 1,263 square kilometers and 93 settlements in the Kursk region.\nHe stated, “ During the offensive in the Kursk region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces advanced 28 to 35 kilometers into the enemy’s defense .”\nAccording to military observer Julian Röpcke from the German Bild, “ The Ukrainian Armed Forces have captured the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka, and they are just 5 kilometers away from the Seym River and closing the ‘encirclement.’ Meanwhile, Ukrainian sources report that between 2,000 and 3,000 Russian soldiers remain trapped inside the encirclement .”\nUkraine's bold gamble: Early impact of Kursk offensive Although the military goals of the large-scale operation are still hidden in the fog of war, its political achievements are already taking shape\nPutin’s failures are also humiliating for his influential supporters, like the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who, as everyone recalls, promised to take Kursk “in three days.”\nNow, Kadyrov has fallen silent in shame, attempting to distract the public from his embarrassment with fabricated stories about Elon Musk gifting him a Tesla Cybertruck. This, too, backfired on Kadyrov, as Musk firmly denied his claims.\nThe silence from the Russian leadership continues, while the Ukrainian Armed Forces are steadily advancing in the Kursk region. Meanwhile, Putin still hasn’t unleashed hellfire on Washington, London, Paris, and other enemy capitals—or even on his own Kursk region.\nVladimir Putin with the Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, at the Grozny Airport on August 20, 2024 But what can he actually do now? Some in the blogosphere are calling for a general mobilization. But what next?\nMillions of soldiers not only need to be clothed and fed, but also trained and armed. And this is where Russia is already facing problems.\nThe Soviet-era stockpiles of weapons are not limitless. New weapons are being produced at a much slower rate than they are being consumed on the Ukrainian front. If Russia were to conscript several million people right now, who would work and produce the very weapons that are already in short supply? By the end of 2023, Russia was already facing a shortage of nearly 5 million workers. Nuclear strikes, whether against a NATO country or even Ukraine, are no longer an option. Moscow has been made very clear on what would happen in such a scenario: NATO would immediately enter the war in Ukraine with all its forces, with dire consequences for the Russian army. And in that case, Putin himself would become a legitimate target for American precision missiles. So what else can Putin do in his current situation? He could strike at “decision-making centers,” as the Kremlin puts it. There was another such raid on Kyiv. But according to Ukrainian media, all the drones, and more importantly, the ballistic missiles from the “Iskanders,” were shot down.\nPreviously, defending against ballistic missiles was the biggest challenge for Ukrainian air defense. But now, everything was intercepted. It’s possible that this was the work of the Ukrainian F-16s, which were largely acquired by Kyiv for this purpose.\nSimultaneously, there have been puzzling diplomatic maneuvers by Putin in recent days.\nHe made a more than strange “official visit” to Baku during the night under these extraordinary circumstances.\nThe question arises—why? According to pro-government media, Putin was discussing Russian gas supplies with Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev.\nBut is this really what the head of state should be doing when enemy troops are steadily advancing into his country?\nVladimir Putin meeting with Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and his wife. Photo: Kremlin website The next fleeting diplomatic news is equally intriguing.\nThe American agency Bloomberg reported that during his upcoming visit to Kyiv on August 23, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi might deliver a message from Putin to president Volodymyr Zelensky.\nWhen was the last time Putin personally addressed Zelensky, even through international intermediaries? This has not happened even before the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, let alone during the past two and a half years of war.\nAnother strange and surprising action by Putin occurred on August 20.\nFor the first time in 20 years, since the Beslan school hostage crisis, he visited and knelt before the memorial to the 333 victims of the September 1, 2004, terrorist attack. What does this signify?\nIn a situation where his future is uncertain, has he decided to atone for one of his most horrific crimes?\nPutin at the “City of Angels” memorial cemetery in Beslan. Photo: Vladimir Astapkovich, RIA Novosti Here’s another interesting piece of information from the Ukrainian side.\nOn August 20, UNIAN, citing Politico, reported that Kyiv plans to use a negotiation format with Moscow similar to the one successfully employed in the grain deal.\nThe report notes that negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were not conducted directly but through an intermediary—Turkey.\nInterestingly, the same report from Politico was relayed on the same day without any comment by the government’s Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\nOn the same day, Apti Alaudinov, commander of the Kadyrov`s “Akhmat” battalion, recorded an intriguing video. On the day Ukrainian forces entered the Kursk region, he cheerfully advised Russians not to worry and to stock up on popcorn, suggesting that they would soon be defeated. Now, he is again making predictions.\nHe claims that the war will end not only in the Kursk region but across the entire territory of the “Special Military Operation” within two to three months. I can agree with him on this. I have repeatedly written that Russia cannot endure such a war for three years.",

The government that wants to take on these difficult new tasks is already failing at such basic services as fixing potholes and policing dangerous neighborhoods.Ticket the buses bringing illegal immigrants to Chicago, mostly from Texas. He calls them “rogue buses” because they are not “coordinating” with the city. Giving them a ticket or even impounding the vehicles is his solution. The bus companies’ own solution is to drop off the passengers in the suburbs, which immediately send them to Chicago. Johnson then rages at the Texas governor and never mentions President Joe Biden.Close down all the selective-enrollment (magnet) schools in Chicago, the only ones where students actually read above grade level. If we judge by the likely outcome, Johnson’s policy is really designed to drive middle-class families with kids out of the city. The teachers union backs the plan, enthusiastically. They must know how good the other schools are since the president of the CTU sends her own child to a private school. Meanwhile, she is working with Gov. J.B. Pritzker to kill school choice for everyone else. The local joke about Mayor Johnson is that his only success has been to lower the price of downtown Chicago real estate. How do voters like Johnson’s ideas and his administration? Not much, it turns out. His poll numbers are roughly the same as those for used car salesmen with loud suits and back lots filled with rusting clunkers. The mayor’s erstwhile supporters have abandoned him. Except for the Chicago Teachers Union. The CTU is easily the most powerful union in Illinois and, most likely, the strongest local teachers union in the country. It was their members who went door-to-door for Johnson’s election. It was their members who tacked up Johnson’s campaign posters and donated the dollars for his TV ads. Now, it is their members who comprise Johnson’s dwindling band of supporters. If it weren’t for them, the mayor could hold a “Reelect Brandon Johnson” rally on a unicycle. Most of Johnson’s policies are standard-issue leftist remedies for big cities. To paraphrase Gilbert and Sullivan, “He is the very model of a modern progressive mayor.” That model is not working. Not in Chicago and not elsewhere. Progressive mayors and prosecutors across the country have made their cities dangerous and ungovernable. Unfortunately, failure has not changed their minds or their policies. Brandon Johnson is no exception. Consider the mayor’s proposal for the city to own and operate grocery stores in impoverished areas. Let’s call them “CastroMarts.” Johnson is right to say some neighborhoods have become “food deserts.” He should ask himself why that is so. Part of the answer is poverty, but those areas were poor before the grocery stores abandoned them. What changed is that those areas are now plagued with organized retail theft, which is almost never prosecuted. Without delving into the root causes of rampant crime (Kamala Harris is searching for them in Central America), it’s up to local police to stop the predation, and it’s up to local prosecutors to go after the robbers and looters. That’s not happening in Chicago – or in San Francisco, Washington, Seattle, Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis, Baltimore, Cleveland, or Portland. Those city governments have abandoned their fundamental responsibilities to “serve and protect.” Is the theory here that somehow thieves wouldn’t steal from city-owned grocery stores? What’s the evidence for that – or that city workers could do a better job than trained professionals? Those businesses operate on very thin margins and require efficient, experienced management. If you don’t sell meat and produce quickly, they rot. The words “quick” and “efficient” have never been used in the same sentence as “Chicago city worker.” Better adjectives would be “slow,” “unionized,” and “well-paid.” When you apply the correct adjectives to grocery store ownership, you get sclerotic management, high prices, and an endless string of taxpayer subsidies. You will get CastroMart, not Walmart. Brandon Johnson’s notions about education are just as compelling. His latest brainstorm is to close the best schools in the city. His stated reason is “equity,” which apparently means “leveling down.” There is no allegation that admission to these selective schools is biased. It is purely merit-based. Yet Chicago’s school board, working closely with the CTU and the mayor, recently approved a plan to “transition away” from these schools. That’s a polite way of saying, “We are going to kill them if we can.” The teachers union defends this euthanasia because of what they call the schools’ “deep inequity.” The facts belie the catchphrase. Over half the students in the 11 selective high schools come from low-income families. Around 70% are Black or Hispanic. Where’s the “deep inequity”? Parents are up in arms. They see powerful, entrenched interests trying to deny their children a good education and cynically justifying it in the name of progressive ideals. They’re right. Johnson’s proposals for migrants are just as popular. Chicago has long proclaimed itself a “sanctuary city,” a label it adopted when sending that virtue signal was costless. It’s not costless anymore. Chicago leaders’ response is to offload all that expensive virtue onto other cities. They are retaining the “sanctuary” slogan, oblivious to the irony. The number of migrants coming to Chicago is still a trickle compared to those surging into Texas and Arizona across an open border. Even so, Chicago can’t handle the modest numbers. It doesn’t have any place to put them or any money to pay for the vital services they require. You see them now camped out on cold city streets and begging for spare change. It’s heartbreaking. Chicago’s real answer to reducing their number is “winter.” Johnson’s original plan was to set up migrant camps across the city. Voters went berserk. Johnson got the message and backed down. His latest plan is to put the migrants in hotels and at O’Hare Airport, issue tickets to the buses that bring them, and blame it all on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. While Johnson has no answers for this deepening mess, he didn’t create it. President Biden did that. Biden is the Einstein who decided to dismantle all of Donald Trump’s programs, such as “Remain in Mexico,” that helped stem the flow of illegals. What was Biden’s rationale? Because the programs were Trump’s. That’s it. To replace them, Biden put in … well, nothing. Surprisingly, that has not worked well. Even the staunchest Democrats recognize the political problems that unchecked immigration is creating. Some are from pushback in the general population, which can see the failure. Some come specifically from the Black community, which is furious about this wave of migrants who compete with Americans for jobs, housing, and social services. Hispanics living here legally are none too happy either. Since Democrats depend on both minorities, especially African Americans, to win elections, the internal fissures over immigration pose real problems. They divide ideological progressives from fellow leftists who are more attentive to their minority constituents. The difficulties will only get worse as the numbers keep rising and the Biden administration keeps resisting efforts to close the border. Those tensions are already visible in Chicago’s minority neighborhoods. But immigration is only one of Brandon Johnson’s headaches. On issue after issue, he has no sensible plans to move forward and few ideas about how to cope with the city’s spiraling problems. His administration is a shambles, and voters know it. They need help. In fact, they are demanding it. They want safety, education and other basic services. They have learned to their regret that they won’t get any of them from the incompetent, unpopular ideologue in City Hall.

    "title": "¿Por qué es obligatorio el uso del velo para las mujeres de Irán?",
    "text": "Irán es el único país del mundo que mantiene obligatorio el uso del velo, también conocido como hiyab. Las mujeres pueden ir a la cárcel si deciden no utilizarlo y cualquier ciudadano pueda reportar su desacato. Esta ley mantiene en vilo la seguridad de las mujeres iraníes y es una de las tantas luchas que han impulsado el movimiento “Mujer, Vida, Libertad”.\nPosiblemente te has preguntado ¿Cuál es el origen del hiyab y por qué el velo es obligatorio para mujeres en Irán? El gobierno iraní basado en las leyes del Islam, mantuvo desde su revolución en 1979, el uso del hiyab como parte de su cultura. Desde entonces, las mujeres podían decidir usarlo o no de acuerdo a su grupo social o religioso de acuerdo a su grupo social o religioso, pero esto cambió.\nEn mayo de 2023, las autoridades de Irán presentaron ante el Parlamento el Proyecto de Ley de Apoyo a la Cultura de la Castidad y el hiyab y el 20 de septiembre, la comisión especial interna aprobó finalmente el texto del proyecto de ley.\nDe acuerdo con las leyes sobre uso obligatorio del velo en Irán, las mujeres y las niñas, incluidas las de tan sólo siete años están obligadas, contra su voluntad, a cubrirse el pelo con un velo. Las mujeres iraníes que no portan el hiyab, son consideradas delincuentes por el Estado.\n¿Qué hace la policía de la moral en Irán? La Policía de la Moral de Irán es quien vigila a toda la población femenina, que representa cerca de 40 millones, entre mujeres y niñas. Estos agentes conducen por toda la ciudad y tienen facultades para dar el alto a cualquier mujer y examinar su vestimenta, estudiando detenidamente cuántos mechones de cabello tiene a la vista, la longitud de sus pantalones y su abrigo y la cantidad de maquillaje que lleva. El castigo para las mujeres de Irán por dejarse ver sin velo en público puede ser de detención, pena de prisión, multa o latigazos.\nAdemás, el Código Penal Civil de Irán contempla en el Artículo 638 que “Todo acto que se considere ofensivo para la moral pública está castigado con una pena de entre 10 días y 2 meses de prisión, o 74 latigazos. Las mujeres a las que se vea en público sin velo serán castigadas con una pena de entre 10 días y 2 meses de prisión o una multa”.",
