[Editors](https://sciencex.com/help/editorial-team/) have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication reputable news agency proofread Here's why some high-risk patients aren't getting drugs to combat COVID As the toll from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to mount, antiviral medications such as Paxlovid were hailed by health officials as an important way to reduce the risk of severe illness or death. Yet the drugs have remained underused, studies have found. In Boston, a group of researchers wanted to know why—and what could be done about it. Their new findings, published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggest that some [vulnerable patients](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vulnerable+patients/) were not offered the prescription medicines at all, and that doctors need more education to make sure the drugs get to patients who could benefit. Researchers from the VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program delved into records from the Veterans Health Administration to look more closely at what happened to high-risk patients who never got Paxlovid, remdesivir or molnupiravir. They focused on 110 patients who received [organ transplants](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/organ+transplants/) or had other [medical conditions](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+conditions/) such as [chronic lymphocytic leukemia](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+lymphocytic+leukemia/) that were likely to leave them immunocompromised and thus at greater risk from COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. Their [analysis](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7303a2.htm?s_cid=mm7303a2_w) in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 20% of those patients turned down the drugs when they were offered. But the remaining 80% of patients were never offered such treatment in the first place. In some cases, medical providers decided not to give patients the COVID-19 drugs because they were worried about how they could interact with other medications patients were already taking, including cholesterol-lowering statins and a drug used to reduce the risk that a transplanted organ would be rejected. In other cases, doctors demurred because their patients had experienced COVID-19 symptoms for more than five days beforehand, beyond the recommended window for getting Paxlovid. Despite public alarm about \"Paxlovid rebound,\" in which symptoms recur after treatment, none of the medical records noted it as a reason not to give the [drug](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug/), the study found. But in almost half of the cases in which people weren't offered the [medication](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/), no reason was given by medical providers other than patients having mild symptoms, the researchers found. But people with mild symptoms early in their illness are \"exactly the target group for getting the treatment,\" said Dr. Paul Monach, who heads the rheumatology section at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and was the study's lead author. The drugs are recommended for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness due to their age or medical conditions—the same kind of patients that the Boston researchers were scrutinizing. The CDC urges doctors to treat [high-risk patients](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-risk+patients/) within five days rather than waiting for their symptoms to worsen. \"Every case starts off mild,\" and it's unpredictable whether they will become more severe, said Dr. Davey Smith, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was not involved in the study. \"It might not be until the fifth or sixth day that you get into trouble—and by that time it's too late to take these medications.\" Smith said he was especially alarmed that people whose immune systems were weakened were not getting the antiviral drugs. \"Those are the people who are still coming into our hospital. And those are the ones who are dying. ... It breaks my heart every time I see them in the hospital and they just didn't get the medication.\" The Boston researchers said their findings suggest that physicians need more education about when to consider using the drugs. Patients, in turn, could be encouraged to reach out to [medical providers](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+providers/) sooner after they start showing symptoms. Monach added that some Veterans Health patients who weren't offered the drugs had gone home before their coronavirus test results had been returned. Clinical staff such as nurses had phoned them to follow up, but did not appear to have mentioned the possibility of antiviral medication, based on the records reviewed by the researchers. \"That doesn't mean that people weren't doing their jobs,\" Monach said, \"but I don't think those people had been informed, as part of their normal jobs, what the indication would be for giving Paxlovid.\" Concerns about Paxlovid and other COVID-19 medications not reaching patients who could benefit have persisted since soon after the drugs became available. Just months after Paxlovid received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, a national survey from the COVID States Project found that among people infected with the coronavirus between May and early July of 2022, only 11% reported having taken antivirals. Among a higher-risk group of people—those over the age of 65—the rate was 20%, \"higher, but still low.\" Another study of patients in the Veterans Affairs health system found that as of early 2023, less than a quarter of outpatients who tested positive for coronavirus infections were receiving any kind of anti-COVID medication. And researchers have also found alarming gaps in who is getting Paxlovid, with Black and Latino patients obtaining such treatment at markedly lower rates than white and non-Latino ones, even among immunocompromised patients. \"I have been banging my head against the wall for my colleagues not using medications,\" Smith said. If physicians or patients are concerned about \"rebound,\" he said, \"COVID has this waxing and waning of symptoms anyway,\" whether you take medication or not. \"And we know this medication, in higher-risk individuals, keeps people out of the hospital and from dying.\" One patient recently told him, \"'Well, the last time I got COVID, I didn't take the medicine and I was fine,'\" Smith said. The problem is \"that's true until it's not. You can only dodge the bullet so many times,\" and the risks grow for an individual as they age. \"Every time that you get COVID, you are getting it at a time when you are older.\" Last month, the California Department of Public Health issued an advisory to physicians and other health care providers, lamenting the underuse of such medications despite an \"ample supply.\" It faulted unfamiliarity with new medications and misperceptions that the drugs were scarce. \"Once an individual is diagnosed with COVID-19, early treatment with antivirals is the only existing strategy to decrease the risk of serious illness and prevent hospitalization,\" the state agency said. \"The greatest benefit of antiviral treatment is seen in those at highest risk for severe disease. ... Risks including Paxlovid rebound, are minimal, especially when weighed against benefits.\" Dr. Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at USC, said that \"it's always worth the conversation\" about whether to take Paxlovid or another antiviral when someone tests positive. The medicines are most effective for people at high risk, but that is a broader swath of the adult population than many people realize, including people who are overweight, have asthma or heart conditions, and even people from racial and ethnic groups that have had worse outcomes from COVID-19, Dang said. Since the risks increase with age, \"if you're above 50 years old, you should definitely consider Paxlovid,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, having some potentially unpleasant side effects that some people report—maybe like stomach upset or metallic taste—is far better than going to the hospital because of COVID,\" he said.

    "text": "Marineland ordered to pay $85k after 3 bears kept in cramped quarters for months\nPosted Aug 15, 2024 05:32:54 PM.\nMarineland has been ordered to pay nearly $85,000 in fines and restitution after it was found guilty under Ontario’s animal cruelty laws of three charges related to its care of three black bears.\nThe amount, which was jointly proposed by lawyers for the Crown and Marineland, includes a $15,000 fine for each of the bears, a 25-per-cent victim surcharge and $28,000 in restitution for the care of the bears after they were seized by animal welfare officers.\nThe Niagara, Ont., tourist attraction was found guilty in March in what’s believed to be its first conviction under animal-cruelty laws.\nAn agreed statement of facts read in court earlier this year said the bears – Slash, Toad and Lizzy – lived in small enclosures with inadequate access to water for months.\nIt said the enclosures measured 48 square feet, with the two females, Toad and Lizzy, sharing one.\nThe statement said animal welfare inspectors visited Marineland in early June 2021 and soon issued orders to the park, including that the bears have enclosures of at least 5,000 square feet if alone and access to water sources.\nNot enough progress had been made on the enclosures months later, court heard Thursday in an updated statement, and Animal Welfare Services eventually removed all three bears from the park’s care.\nA lawyer representing Marineland told the court Thursday the orders were issued during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was difficult to find staff to do the carpentry work required to improve the enclosures, but that efforts were underway at the time the bears were removed.\nMichelle Psutka added the sentence represents a “significant” fine.\n“This is a first-time offence for Marineland, and again we are dealing with a fail-to-comply case, not a case of a finding of animal cruelty,” she said in her submissions.\nMarineland has until late September to pay the restitution fee, which the Crown said is based on costs of $145 a day to care for two of the bears over roughly six months before they were brought to a permanent enclosure at a wildlife facility.\nThe justice of the peace overseeing the case said she was satisfied the jointly proposed sentence addressed the need for deterrence as well as any aggravating and mitigating factors.\nAnimal Justice, an animal law advocacy organization, expressed disappointment that prosecutors didn’t seek an order prohibiting Marineland from having other animals, and that no ongoing remedial measures were imposed.\nHowever, the organization — which unsuccessfully sought to participate in the sentencing as an intervener — hailed the ruling as historic as it marks the first time the roadside zoo and aquarium has faced legal consequences for animal welfare offences.\n“Today marks a watershed moment in the fight to protect vulnerable animals from being abused for entertainment,” Camille Labchuk, the organization’s executive direction, said in a statement.\nThe province has been investigating the park for four years.\nOne killer whale, 14 beluga whales and one dolphin have died at the park since 2019. Currently, 15 bears remain at Marineland.",

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

As of Friday afternoon a winter storm watch was issued for much of the area northwest of Albert Lea, though the city itself was not under a watch. That will likely change moving into Saturday. The weather agency states snow could be heavy at times Sunday afternoon and evening, and snowfall rates could exceed 1 to 2 inches per hour. Because temperatures will be in the lower 30s, it is expected that there will be a wet and heavy snow. On Sunday, temperatures will remain below freezing all day, so there should be no question about precipitation type that day. Moving into Monday, the weather agency was less confident in its forecast. While precipitation is expected to continue, warm air could lead to a rain and snow mix along Interstate 90. Snow could continue into Tuesday with a few more inches of precipitation possible.",
