    "text": "By Kimberley Kao\nAsian stock markets fell Thursday, tracking U.S. futures as investors weighed concerns about inflation in the U.S. and potential escalation in Middle East tensions.\nJapan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 0.8% and South Korea's Kospi was 0.5% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.95%, while China's Shanghai Composite Index was 0.3% lower.\nFutures tied to U.S. indexes were in the red. Dow futures were down 0.2%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures fell 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday projected confidence when he insisted the central bank was in a good position to handle whatever the economy does next, but acknowledged that the Fed has little idea what's actually coming.\n\"We haven't been through a situation like this, and I think we have to be humble about our ability to forecast it,\" Powell said.\nWhile the Fed's decision to retain the status quo was widely expected, the key context is that more Fed members now see fewer rate cuts this year, reflecting their expectations for elevated and persistent uncertainty, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Securities said in a note.\nEconomic projections show officials expect U.S. inflation and unemployment to rise this year by more than they projected in March.\nStill, markets seem less fussed about the Fed decision and more concerned about geopolitics, Varathan said.\n\"For now, the Iran-Israel conflict is likely to drown out Fed nuances as headline-driven instincts for risk re-pricing will dominate,\" he said.\nFront-month WTI crude oil futures were 0.1% lower at $75.09 a barrel on Thursday morning in Asia. Brent crude futures were down 0.4% to $76.40 a barrel.\nHowever, oil prices remain on an upward trajectory.\nCrude prices rose nearly 20% in June, with more than half of the gains occurring just this week, said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, in a note.\n\"Investors, however, are still preparing for volatility,\" Sachdeva said.\nBitcoin, viewed as a proxy for risk, was 0.2% higher.\nMeanwhile, spot gold was last up 0.2% at $3,377.11 a troy ounce.\nGoldman Sachs research analysts said in a note that the investment bank's \"global indices of oil shipping rates reflect an increase over the past week as increased risks have lifted rates for Middle Eastern routes.\"\nThe probability of U.S. military action against Iran appears to be higher than a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, meaning that oil markets will likely see elevated prices over the next few months, the Goldman analysts said.\nWrite to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n06-18-25 2343ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2025",

    "text": "Israeli forces on Thursday battled Hamas in Gaza where air strikes and urban combat rocked the southern city of Khan Yunis, near where many hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.\nUN World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for \"urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril\" facing besieged Gaza's people, including \"terrible injuries, acute hunger and... severe risk of disease\".\nIn Jerusalem, families of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza again rallied for their release, and a kibbutz announced that a 70-year-old US-Israeli thought to be the oldest woman held captive had died in the October 7 attacks.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was \"devastated\" by the news Judith Weinstein Haggai was dead, and pledged that Washington will \"not stop working\" with its ally Israel to bring the remaining hostages home.\nThe war, which started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has left much of northern Gaza in ruins while the battlefront has shifted ever further to the south of the besieged territory.\nThe Israeli army said it had deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, where AFP correspondents reported sustained air and artillery strikes.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent society reported that shelling had killed at least 10 people near the city's Al-Amal hospital, an area where it said about 14,000 people are sheltering.\nLater Thursday, Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry said 20 people were killed, most of them women and children, and dozens wounded in shelling of the Shaboura camp in the southern city of Rafah.\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nHamas on October 7 also took 250 hostages, more than half of whom remain captive -- a source of intense anxiety for their families who protested in Jerusalem with the demand to \"bring them home\".\nIsrael's relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.\nAshraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the ministry, on Thursday reported an additional 200 deaths, \"including entire families\", over the past 24 hours in strikes.\nThe Israeli army says 167 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in its fight against Hamas which Israel, the United States and European Union consider a \"terrorist\" group.\nIn total, the army said, more than 500 soldiers had been killed since October 7, including in the Hamas attack and the battle to retake control of southern Israel, inside Gaza, and in cross-border hostilities with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n- Quadruplets born in war -\nMore than 80 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes, the UN says, and many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents in the far south, around the city of Rafah near Egypt.\nIn the central al-Maghazi refugee camp, which was targeted on Sunday by a strike that killed at least 70 people, resident Waleed Mohammed Aeid voiced his pain and frustration.\n\"They told us to go to Rafah, but we don't want to,\" he said. \"Why? To go live in the streets there?\n\"All the neighbourhood here was evacuated. They bombed the school, but we didn't leave because we don't have anywhere else to go.\"\nAn Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.\nThe severe shortages have been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.\nIsrael said Thursday it had given preliminary approval to the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus for a \"maritime lifeline\" to ship aid to Gaza.\n\"There's a basic authorisation to use this route, but there are still some logistical problems that are waiting to be solved,\" said Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat.\nOne of the many Palestinians displaced, 28-year-old Iman al-Masry, recently gave birth to quadruplets in southern Gaza after fleeing her home in the devastated north.\nThe arduous journey \"affected my pregnancy\", she said, recounting that she gave birth by C-section on December 18 to two girls and two boys, one of whom was too fragile to leave hospital.\n\"They are very slim,\" she said, speaking in a schoolroom turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. \"It's cold and windy and there's no bathtub... I just use wipes.\"\n- Mideast tensions flare -\nViolence has also flared across the Israel-occupied West Bank, with at least 314 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers since October 7, according to the territory's health ministry.\nIsraeli forces overnight raided money exchange shops across the West Bank which the military said had provided funds for armed groups.\nIn Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, one man was killed by the troops, according to the health ministry, and another was later shot near Bethlehem.\nA UN report said the human rights situation in the West Bank was rapidly deteriorating and urged Israel to \"end unlawful killings\" against the Palestinian population.\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war has also sharply heightened tensions between Israel and its long-time arch foe Iran, which supports armed groups across the Middle East.\nIran blamed Israel for a missile strike in Syria on Monday that killed the senior Iranian military commander Razi Moussavi, whose mass funeral took place in Tehran on Thursday.\nThe crowd chanted \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America\" after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led a prayer over the body of Moussavi, a top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arms the Quds Force.\nTehran has vowed to avenge the death of the most senior Guards general killed since the US assassination of Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\nIsrael has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon since the Gaza war erupted, and warned it will step up military action unless Hezbollah militants withdraw further from the border.\nHezbollah accused Israel of hacking into CCTV camera systems installed outside homes and shops in southern Lebanon and urged residents there to take the devices offline.\nAnother Iran ally, Yemen's Huthi rebel group, has launched repeated drone and missile attacks at Israel, which have been intercepted. It has also targeted ships in the Red Sea, disrupting international trade.\nbur-jd/fz/srm",

    "text": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's\neditorial process\nand policies.\nEditors have highlighted\nthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\nfact-checked\ntrusted source\nproofread\nA different picture of the Serengeti: Competition for food drives planet's remaining mass migration of herbivores\nUpending the prevailing theory of how and why multi-species mass-migration patterns occur in Serengeti National Park, researchers from Wake Forest University have confirmed that the millions-strong wildebeest population pushes zebra herds along in competition for the most nutrient-dense grasses.\nThe study resulting from this research, \"Interplay of competition and facilitation in grazing succession by migrant Serengeti herbivores,\"\nappears in Science.\nFor decades, biologists have believed the major grazing populations in Serengeti—zebra, then wildebeest and then Thomson's gazelle—each cleared the way for the smaller herbivores that followed, facilitating their access to the plants they preferred.\nThis study paints a different picture of the Serengeti landscape. Based on the largest and most comprehensive data analysis to date, it is the first study to combine information from camera traps, GPS collars on individual animals, diet analysis and satellites that track the effects fires and rainfall have on the grassland.\nThe research team, led by Wake Forest University Professor of Biology T. Michael Anderson, demonstrates that wildebeest and zebra compete for the best parts of the tall grasses that cover Serengeti. Once those two grazing populations move on, the gazelle then can access the flowering plants and shrubs that grow beneath the grass cover.\n\"Zebra are essentially bulk feeders. They require a large amount of vegetation in order to meet their energy demands,\" explained Anderson, the study's principal investigator and corresponding author. \"If they stayed behind the wildebeest, the wildebeest would just consume all the vegetation and the zebra wouldn't be able to meet those energy demands. That observation was novel, and we call it the push-pull hypothesis for grazing succession. Instead of facilitation, it's competition on the front end.\"\nThe zebra population is around 200,000 strong in Serengeti, whereas the wildebeest top 1.3 million.\n\"It's like an enormous lawn mower,\" Anderson said. \"They have a huge effect on the grass biomass.\"\nSerengeti is the perfect setting for such a study. Because many of the multi-species mass migrations on the planet have been eliminated, the movement of the zebra, wildebeest and gazelle is unique.\nTypically, three factors can influence herbivore mass-migration patterns: competition for food; facilitation, or the act of one species improving the foraging opportunities for another; and predation, where the\ngrazing animals form mixed herds to avoid being eaten.\nCompetition influences the larger of the Serengeti species migration, but facilitation does come into play. While the wildebeest push the zebra in competition for food, the larger species make it easier for the gazelle to reach those rare forbs—flowering plants—that offer them the most nutrition. Later in the season, the gazelle switch to eating the young grasses that are regrowing in the wake of the zebra and wildebeest grazing.\nAnderson said the findings in Serengeti have application across the globe, where scientists are trying to restore the vast grasslands where plants and animals co-evolved. As Serengeti still functions the way it did hundreds of thousands of years ago, its management can help inform projects such as American Prairie.\n\"If we're going to learn to manage these ecosystems in the face of global climate change and increasing anthropogenic effects, we are going to have to learn from these mechanisms,\" he said.\nThe research team included Staci Hepler, Robert J. Erhardt and Robert Sketch of the Wake Forest University Department of Statistical Sciences, as well as Jeffrey Muday of the biology department.\nAnderson and Hepler, one of the project's statisticians, both said the collaboration between the departments led to much stronger results after the data analysis. Understanding the biology, Hepler said, allowed her to create statistical models for the project.\n\"The hypotheses around competition, facilitation and predation have been around for a long time, but they are hard to validate with the data that are typically available,\" she explained. \"Our collaboration required lots of conversations with the biologists explaining the processes and theories, and me explaining the modeling we were doing, so the models being developed could actually test the hypotheses. You have to have collaborations to make sure you're answering the right questions.\"\nAlso contributing were Ricardo M. Holdo and Jason E. Donaldson of the University of Georgia; J. Grant C. Hopcraft and Thomas A. Morrison of the University of Glasgow; Matthew C. Hutchinson of University of California Merced; Sarah E. Huebner and Craig Packer of University of Minnesota; Issack N. Munuo of Serengeti Wildlife Research Institute; and Meredith S. Palmer, Johan Pansu and Robert M. Pringle of Princeton University.\nAnderson and several of the paper's co-authors are using similar data to look at parasite dynamics in Serengeti herbivores in an effort to determine how nematodes, or parasites living the guts of grazers, move around in the landscape. The findings could aid in the understanding of how such parasites are transferred to domestic animals living on the edges of the national park.\nMore information:\nT.
