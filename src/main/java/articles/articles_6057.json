    "text": "(The Center Square) — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is being criticized for proposing double-digit fare increases on New Jersey Transit to help plug a post-pandemic deficit at the public transportation agency.\nNJ Transit has proposed a 15% fare hike for train, light rail and bus service beginning this summer, forcing tens of thousands of people who commute to New York City for work to dig deeper into their pockets. The transit agency has also proposed a 3% fare hike for every subsequent year. The last fare hike was in 2015.\nWhile NJ Transit has received billions of dollars in federal pandemic aid, the agency says money is nearly exhausted. Ridership has returned to only 80% of pre-pandemic levels, the agency says, resulting in a nearly $2 billion reduction in fare revenue.\nAs such, the agency projected a $119 million deficit this fiscal year and plans to reduce that revenue shortfall with $44 million in cost reductions and $52 million in revenue enhancements.\nBut the agency says the fare hike is needed to close the remaining gap between expenses and revenues in the current fiscal year.\n\"This proposed fare adjustment, along with NJ Transit's internal efficiencies, savings and revenue enhancements would allow for a fully funded FY25 operating budget that avoids reducing service levels,\" the agency said in a statement.\nBut Republican lawmakers blasted the NJ Transit fare hikes as \"unacceptable\" and will only make it harder for our already financially strapped transit riders to make ends meet. They criticized the Murphy Administration for \"egregious spending habits,\" such as authorizing the transit agency to lease \"extremely expensive\" new headquarters.\n\"This was just poor fiscal management that has now left transit riders and New Jersey taxpayers shouldering the bill,\" Senate Minority Leader Sen. Anthony Bucco said in a statement. \"We need to be better stewards of taxpayers’ dollars and start cutting wasteful spending to address growing affordability issues such as this.”\nThe Regional Plan Association, a transit advocacy group, called the proposed fare hikes \"unconscionable\" and said it was \"disappointing\" that the Murphy administration didn't propose alternatives to whittle down the agency's revenue shortfall.\n\"Fare hikes, especially increases of this magnitude, should be the option of last resort, not the State’s opening salvo,\" said Zoe Baldwin, the association's New Jersey expert. \"Some of this structural deficit is inherited, but that’s no excuse to leave riders holding the bag.\nHe said the \"lack of action towards a better, dedicated funding mechanism for transit all but guaranteed that riders would get hit with a big, double-digit increase instead of smaller, easier-to-absorb increases over time.\"\n\"There are many ways to address NJ Transit’s looming fiscal cliff without resorting to such drastic measures, and we are incredibly disappointed that none of the other options were seriously explored before riders were saddled with this fare hike,\" he said.",

    "text": "CyberWyoming brings back “Talk Like a Vampire” initiative for the New Year “Talk Like a Vampire” initiative aims to shed light, on cyber security. CASPER, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - In the dynamic realm of cybersecurity, organizations continually seek innovative methods to raise awareness about the concealed threats in the digital landscape. CyberWyoming, a pioneering force in small business cybersecurity education, has embraced an unconventional approach with the introduction of “Talk Like a Vampire Month.” This initiative aims not only to inject a sense of levity into the typically serious subject of cybersecurity but also to illuminate how interpreting emails with a vampire’s perspective can enhance the identification of suspicious activities. Throughout this unique month-long initiative, CyberWyoming urges its employees to immerse themselves in the speech patterns and mindset of the immortal creatures of the night as they navigate their daily digital interactions. Although it may initially appear whimsical, the underlying objective is to foster a heightened sense of vigilance and skepticism, particularly in the context of email communication. Laura Baker, the Executive Director of CyberWyoming, emphasizes the impact of adopting a vampire accent, stating, “Reading an email using a vampire accent activates your stranger danger and makes you more suspicious. So, we encourage small businesses in Wyoming to adopt Talk Like a Vampire Month.” Here’s how businesses can participate: - Initiate the month by announcing the theme, encouraging employees to print out any suspicious emails encountered at home or work. - Have employees bring these emails to a staff meeting, where they read them aloud with a vampiric accent. - Award prizes for the best vampiric accent, the employee who identifies the most suspicious emails, and the most reluctant participant embracing the Talk Like a Vampire challenge. Much like a vampire meticulously assesses every detail before granting entry to their crypt, CyberWyoming advocates for a thorough examination of the sender’s identity, email content, and any embedded links or attachments. “Talk Like a Vampire Month” serves as a timely reminder of the escalating sophistication of cybercriminal tactics. Through a playful yet discerning approach, CyberWyoming aims to empower individuals to proactively safeguard their business information, digital identities, and all sensitive information. While CyberWyoming’s “Talk Like a Vampire Month” may appear lighthearted, it conveys a profound message about the significance of skepticism in the digital age. Reading emails like a vampire transcends mere creative expression; it represents a strategic mindset crucial for identifying and thwarting potential cyber threats. As we navigate the intricate web of digital communication, embracing a touch of vampiric suspicion might indeed be the key to warding off the dark forces lurking in the digital realm.
