    "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has expressed gratitude to the Inspector General of Police, the state Commissioner of Police and the Ooni of Ife for ensuring peaceful activities of religious groups in Ife, Osun State, despite the curfew earlier planned by Oro worshippers. The Executive Director of MURIC, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement, said the group spearheaded the cry against the proposed curfew by the Oro worshipers, because it will affect the activities of Muslims in the state. However, the curfew did not take place due to the intervention of the Ooni of Ife and the security agencies. Akintola said: “Reports reaching us from our situation room in Ile-Ife indicate the total failure of the curfew declared by Oro worshippers in Ile-Ife yesterday, March 27, 2024. From Arubidi through Ehindi, Enuwa, Oriyangi, Igbotapa, Ilare, Moore, etc, the city bubbled with activities as citizens went about their daily work without fear. “Though the Oro worshippers came out in a procession, their outing took place parri pasu with the Ramadan tafsir programmes going on in Enuwa Central Mosque as well as other mosques situated in Ilare, Arubidi, Itakogun, Igbotapa, Ilode, Sabo and other mosques. “MURIC is also in possession of strong evidence of a peaceful atmosphere in the form of a video showing Muslims as they assembled in front of their mosque listening to the Ramadan tafsir while at the same time a procession of Oro worshippers passed by peacefully. The video also showed a good number of policemen in uniform who accompanied the Oro worshippers to maintain law and order. “MURIC thanks the Inspector General of Police, the state Commissioner of Police and the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II. We commend the professional conduct of men of the Nigeria Police in Ile-Ife. In particular, the Ooni must be singled out for the mature and fatherly role which he played in the issue. “We have reports that the Ooni invited leaders of the Oro worshippers and the Muslims and directed that both groups should go about their affairs without disturbing each other or engaging in any act of violence. This is leadership par excellence and we appreciate his Royal Majesty for this. An earlier video clip which is available on YouTube showed the Ooni advising Oro worshippers to stop daytime curfews. “Before we draw the curtain, we wish to put our policy on interfaith in proper perspective, particularly our relationship with followers of African Traditional Religion (Oro worshippers and adherents of masquerades, Osun, Obatala, etc). MURIC embraces people of other faiths in dialogue, tolerance and mutual respect. Our motto is ‘Dialogue, No Violence’.” “In our own view, Oro worshippers, masquerades, Obatala, Osun adherents and others are free to observe their festivals and worship the way they like so long as they do not stop us from worshipping the way we like. “Our policy on interreligious coexistence is based on the guideline laid down by the Glorious Qur’an that ‘For you is your religion and for us our religion’ (Qur’an 109:6). It is only those who are bent on spreading falsehood who call MURIC an extremist group that does not want to see traditionalists and Christians.” He said. 0 Comments [cancel reply](/features/friday-worship/muric-lauds-ooni-police-for-ensuring-peaceful-religious-activities-in-ife/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.

    "text": "A workshop report from a 2022 meeting held by Associate Professor of Geosciences Catherine “Cat” Beck in Nairobi was published in the June issue of Scientific Drilling. Beck said the report, “ [ICDP workshop on the Deep Drilling in the Turkana Basin project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381506297_ICDP_workshop_on_the_Deep_Drilling_in_the_Turkana_Basin_project_exploring_the_link_between_environmental_factors_and_hominin_evolution_over_the_past_4_Myr): exploring the link between environmental factors and hominin evolution over the past 4 Myr” is one step in gaining approval for a two-phase project that would “explore the impact of several types of evolution (tectonic, climatic, biological) on ecosystems and environments.” She is working with a team of researchers from around the globe on a project that uses scientific drill cores to “look into the processes of the past and present.” The researchers say that samples recovered from eastern Africa’s dynamic tectonic, environmental, climatic, and ecological setting “give them a way to look at change through time in unprecedented ways.” Beck noted that in addition to the workshop report, a related drilling proposal was submitted in January and is still under review. “These are just the first steps of what will be a multi-year push towards realizing this project but the science we would produce will be game changing so definitely worth the long spin up,” she said. Hamilton students [Sara Shedroff ’23 and Marcella Winget ’24](https://my.hamilton.edu/news/story/catherine-beck-kenya-turkana-basin-miocene-geoscience) traveled to Kenya with Beck during the summer of 2022 to participate in the research, which received [funding from the National Science Foundation](https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/nsf-ethiopia-turkana-homo-sapiens-cat-beck-geoscience).

    "text": "The Guardian National archives: Tony Blair was advised to work with militants in Kosovo Read full article Kevin Rawlinson and Caroline Davies December 29, 2023 at 2:01 a.m. · 2 min read Photograph: Adam Butler/PA Tony Blair was advised to work with militants in Kosovo, some of whom have subsequently been put on trial for war crimes, despite reportedly believing they were “not much better than the Serbs” whose own crimes against humanity he was seeking to end, it has been revealed.\nBlair, then the UK prime minister, had grave concerns about being seen to be too close to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which was fighting against the Serbian nationalist forces led by Slobodan Milošević.\nBut he was advised: “Overall, our starting point in a conflict like this should be that your enemy’s enemy is your friend.”\nIn a paper prepared by John Sawers, then Blair’s foreign affairs adviser and later the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, the former prime minister was told: “We’re in danger of being too sniffy. We do not want to favour the KLA politically over other Kosovar parties.\n“But we have to reckon on the KLA becoming vastly more popular after what has happened [in the Yugoslav wars], and recognise that they are the only party with an army of sorts.”\nRelated: War crimes tribunal centres on how much former Kosovan president knew\nIn the paper, sent to Blair and his senior aides, Sawers suggested it would be impossible to disarm the KLA after the conflict. Instead, he advised, it would be better to work with the organisation to bring about elections.\nAt the bottom of the paper, released to the National Archives by the Cabinet Office on Friday, an unsigned hand has written: “I agree.”\nThe note makes clear the angst within No 10 about the nature and extent of the UK’s involvement in the brutal multi-factional conflict that raged in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001.\nNato interventions included airstrikes against the forces of Milošević, who died in 2006 while being tried for war crimes.\nThe UK, under Blair’s leadership, would subsequently become one of the principal backers of the KLA under its then leader Hashim Thaçi.\nIn April this year, the latter appeared in the dock of a court in The Hague – alongside three prominent colleagues – accused of war crimes that include alleged complicity in the murders of 102 people.\nA spokesman for Blair declined to comment.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "新华社合肥3月12日电（记者水金辰）记者3月12日从安徽省人民政府新闻发布会获悉，安徽今年加快构建省级林业碳票制度，着力形成多种形式的“碳票+”应用场景，推动森林资源价值实现转化。\n  据了解，安徽集体林占全省森林面积的九成以上，但森林资源长期存在“难度量、难抵押、难交易、难变现”等“四难”问题，价值转化路径不畅。安徽省林业局相关负责人表示，省里通过开发林业碳票这种林地林木碳减排量收益权凭证，探索地方性的市场化推进林业碳汇交易机制，为林农增收开辟新路径。\n  在构建省级林业碳票制度上，安徽今年明确优化升级林业碳票项目方法学，推出湿地碳票项目方法学，有序推进省级林业碳票制发交易，并探索“国储林+林下经济+碳汇”模式，着力形成“碳票+金融”“碳票+司法”“碳票+零碳景区”等多种消纳渠道。安徽省林业局总工程师李拥军表示，近期安徽将印发实施《安徽省林业碳票管理办法》，全面推动森林固碳释氧功能可计量、可交易，让改革发展成果惠及更多林农。\n  另据了解，安徽此前已在6个地市开展了地方碳票、碳汇项目试点交易。其中蚌埠市发行涂山、大洪山两张林业碳票，涉及林地29442亩，质押贷款2550万元。\n  \n【纠错】",
