    "text": "Russell Wilson benched by Broncos: Everything to know, what's next? A nine-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl-winning quarterback benched by a team still in playoff contention? The [Denver Broncos](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/denver-broncos-team)' decision to bench [Russell Wilson](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/russell-wilson-player) rocked the NFL world Wednesday, but the move is a complex one with multiple layers that go beyond just how the 35-year-old quarterback has performed in his second season in Denver. Let's sort through it all: How well was Wilson playing? The 12-year veteran has posted much better numbers in 2023 than in his debut season with the Broncos, throwing for 3,070 yards with 26 touchdown passes and just eight interceptions. That statistical line is on par with Wilson's numbers from his [Seattle](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/seattle-seahawks-team) days and the TD-to-INT ratio is better than two-time MVP [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/patrick-mahomes-ii-player) has posted this year (26 TDs, 14 picks). But the numbers don't tell the full story about Wilson's effectiveness. Denver's offense has been stagnant, ranking 25th in the league overall and averaging less than 300 yards per game. The passing attack also ranks in the bottom seven of the league, posting less than 200 yards per game (198.5), despite the presence of big-play receivers [Courtland Sutton](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/courtland-sutton-player) and [Jerry Jeudy](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jerry-jeudy-player). Those aren't the type of numbers that offensive guru Sean Payton envisioned for his first season on the sideline in Denver. And the Broncos are trending down over the last month, having lost three of four, with Wilson throwing six TDs and four picks.

[What's next for Russell Wilson after being benched by Broncos?](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/whats-next-for-russell-wilson-after-being-benched-by-broncos) [Which NFL teams are the best fit for Broncos' Russell Wilson?](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/which-nfl-teams-are-the-best-fit-for-broncos-russell-wilson) [Russell Wilson: Broncos threatened to bench me after Chiefs win if I didn't amend contract](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/russell-wilson-broncos-threatened-to-bench-me-after-chiefs-win-if-i-didnt-amend-contract) But Denver is still in the hunt, right? Technically, yes. But the Broncos (7-8) currently sit 12th in the AFC and have just a 1.4 percent chance to make the playoffs, [according to one probability model](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/broncos-percentage-playoff-denver-loss-new-england-patriots/#:~:text=SportsLine%20is%20out%20with%20its,lowest%20percentage%20chance%20%2D%2D%201.4%25.). Denver, which is coming off an embarrassing Christmas Eve loss to the Patriots (4-11), would need to win out and have the Chiefs lose both of their remaining games to even have a shot. So, what else is behind the decision? This is where things get complicated, and it all starts with the massive contract extension that Wilson signed with the Broncos right after he was dealt from Seattle — and before he'd played even one game in the Mile-High City. That massive five-year, $245 million contract included $165 million guaranteed, which will complicate Denver's salary-cap situation for years to come. Wilson already has a $39 million guarantee in place for 2024, and he stands to gain $37 million in additional guarantees if he's on Denver's roster on the fifth day of the league year in 2024. That $37 million also would become guaranteed if Wilson failed to pass a physical with the Broncos, so a potential injury in the final two games would lock in Wilson's money and greatly limit Denver's flexibility with the QB. Thus, putting Wilson on the bench eliminates the possibility of an injury forcing Denver's hand. Is Wilson done in Denver? It sure looks like it. Reports emerged later Wednesday that Wilson expects to be released next spring, and the quarterback posted on social media that he's already thinking about the next chapter of his career. Was this divorce unavoidable? This saga has been unfolding throughout the season, as the Broncos reportedly asked Wilson earlier in 2023 to restructure his deal to change the guaranteed money, and the team threatened to bench him as far back as October. When the QB and his camp refused to alter a contract that is just 15 months old, that led to Wednesday's developments. So, what's next for Wilson and the Broncos? FOX NFL Insider [Peter Schrager](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/peter-schrager) joined the [\"NFL on FOX\" podcast](https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-nfl-on-fox-podcast) and said he sees a limited market for Wilson, [likely consisting of just a handful of teams.](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/whats-next-for-russell-wilson-after-being-benched-by-broncos) OK, so which teams could be in the market for Wilson? On Thursday's edition of \"The Herd,\" [Colin Cowherd](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/colin-cowherd) went through a full list of QB-needy teams to evaluate the field. NFL Insider Albert Breer also joined \"The Herd\" on Thursday and said Wilson is in a similar situation to Cam Newton and Tim Tebow in that it might be difficult for a team to bring him in as a backup. So, will Russ find a starting job in 2024? Will he accept a No. 2 job? Will he be willing to be a \"bridge QB\" for a team that has drafted a rookie?

    "title": "Fever GM Rules WNBA’s Strict Policy as the Reason Behind the Lack of Signings for Caitlin Clark and Co. - EssentiallySports",
    "text": "Caitlin Clark is subjected to a unique situation. The Indiana Fever has an 11-15 tally despite Clark’s presence, which is very unusual for her. Hence, fans are suggesting that if the Fever is to make it to the playoffs, they would need new reinforcements that can infuse zest and a winning spirit in the team. However, the Fever’s general manager Lin Dunn has blamed the hard salary cap as a major impediment to their plans of having a game-changing trade. Dunn was present in a conversation with the IndyStar on Wednesday when she reflected on WNBA trade deadline and how the Fever is compelled to not make any major trade decisions just now. Let’s have a look at what this is about. LIN DUNN SPEAKS OF THE DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR CAITLIN CLARK & CO. “I’ve had a few phone calls, I’ve made a few phone calls, but what I think people don’t understand, in particular the fans, is that with a hard salary cap, it’s very difficult to maneuver and make trades, you know, realistic, substantial trades, because you’re limited with your salary cap and your roster spots. So I don’t anticipate there being any blockbuster trades,” Dunn stated as per IndyStar [https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2024/08/15/will-indiana-fever-make-a-move-ahead-of-wnba-trade-deadline-free-agents-gabby-williams-odyssey-sims/74806871007/]. The WNBA has a hard salary cap of $1,463,200. The Fever already has a total cap allocation of $1,396,695 and a cap space of $66,505. This is one of the prime reasons that the WNBA won’t be having many trades this season. The best they can do is to move a benched player to another team while acquiring a player who has been benched most of the season. Caitlin Clark [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-06-01T200031Z_901347053_MT1USATODAY23444438_RTRMADP_3_WNBA-CHICAGO-SKY-AT-INDIANA-FEVER.jpg]Jun 1, 2024; Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) reacts after a call during a game against the Chicago Sky during a game at Grainbridge Fieldhouse. Mandatory Credit: Michelle Pemberton/INDIANAPOLIS STAR-USA TODAY Sports Plus, to make things difficult for franchises, all players have fully guaranteed salaries this year. Therefore, even if a player is released by any franchise, they will have to pay the athlete the remaining amount. Though the situation is complicated for franchises, they can acquire players who have not been a part of the WNBA in the prorated contracts. WHO CAN THE INDIANA FEVER ACQUIRE? When it comes to the Fever’s current season, they would want to acquire someone who can play the second fiddle or a connector between layups. Plus, another quality that they will be on the lookout for is a player to be strong in defense. The athlete can join the Fever if they have been waived by their previous team or have not taken the hardwood in this season. This makes a solid case for the three Olympic stars. Belgian center Emma Meesseman and French guards Gabby Williams [https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-after-angel-reese-gabby-williams-receives-huge-praise-from-diamond-deshields-over-her-physical-gift-amid-looming-wnba-return/] and Marine Johannes have had a brilliant Olympic season. Hence, they can try to make a place in the WNBA demanding their fair share of money. However, as per the cap space, there isn’t a lot for the Fever to pay which can foil their plans of signing a star player. “They missed the first part of the season to train. Now, they’ve gone through the Olympics. They’re tired, and if they come back, it’ll be a lot of money. There’s not a lot of money to give anybody,” Dunn exclaimed of the three athletes. Whether the Fever will acquire a star player or not is something that is yet to be seen. But, the WNBA restrictions holding Clark & Co. from getting reinforcements is something that stands true.

    "text": "El Arsenal cae en casa contra el West Ham y cede el liderato de la Premier El Arsenal cae ante el West Ham United y cede el liderato de la Premier League Tras su victoria en Boxing Day, el Liverpool es el nuevo líder gracias al triunfo por 0-2 de los 'hummers' en el Emirates No pudo el Arsenal con la presión y cedió el liderato de la Premier League en favor del [Liverpool.](https://okdiario.com/deportes/boxing-day-premier-league-12126287) Los de Mikel Arteta vieron en Boxing Day como los reds les adelantaban en la tabla, pero tenían la oportunidad de volver a dejar todo en el mismo orden con un derbi en casa ante el West Ham United. Sin embargo, los hummers asaltaron el Emirates, con una victoria que aprieta aún más la parte alta de la clasificación. Iniciaba el Arsenal el partido a dos puntos del momentáneo líder de la Premier y salían con ganas de que quedara en eso, algo efímero. Después de sacar un valioso empate en [Anfield](https://okdiario.com/deportes/arsenal-empata-sale-lider-anfield-12120139) el pasado fin de semana, este jueves se medían en casa a un West Ham que llegaba dispuesto a meterse en la pelea por Europa, puesto que el Tottenham –quinto– iba cayendo ante el Brighton. El duelo comenzó con un Arsenal motivado, buscando constantemente la portería de Areola y con una abrumadora sensación de superioridad. Pero a las primeras de cambio recibieron un golpe del que no conseguirían reponerse. En el primer acercamiento del West Ham, se adelantaron los visitantes. Lo hicieron con un gol a lo Japón, puesto que el balón pareció salir por la línea de fondo antes del centro que remataría Soucek. La defensa gunner se quedó paralizada, permitiendo la llegada del checo desde segunda línea, que batió a David Raya. El VAR revisó la acción, pero no había una toma clara en la que se viera si la pelota salía totalmente o no por la línea de cal, por lo que se mantuvo la decisión inicial del colegiado y el gol subió al marcador. Ya en la segunda parte, lejos de empatar el choque, el [Arsenal](https://okdiario.com/noticias/arsenal/) confirmaría su derrota. Fue tras la salida de un córner, en el minuto 55. Ward-Prowse ponía un balón al primer palo, donde aparecía Mavropanos como un avión para poner con un cabezazo el segundo, que tocaba en el larguero antes de acabar dentro de la portería. La derrota es la tercera del Arsenal esta temporada en la Premier. Se trata de la segunda en los últimos cuatro partidos de liga, en los que sólo ha sumado una victoria. El conjunto londinense se queda en segunda posición con 40 puntos, superado por el Liverpool, que tiene 42, y tres por encima de un Manchester City que tiene un partido menos. El Tottenham se aleja de la Premier Después de tres partidos consecutivos ganados, que les habían llevado a reengancharse a la pelea por la Liga, después de sacar un punto de 15 posibles, el [Tottenham](https://okdiario.com/noticias/tottenham-hotspur/) volvió a caer. Lo hizo en su visita al Amex Stadium, donde el Brighton & Hove Albion fue muy superior y se llevó el triunfo por 4-2. Los spurs se fueron perdiendo por 2-0 al descanso, con goles de Hinshelwood y Joao Pedro, aunque pudo ser peor. Tras la reanudación, lejos de recortar distancias y meterse en el partido, los seagulls ampliarían su renta por medio de Estupiñán y de Joao Pedro, de nuevo. Alejo Veliz y Ben Davies maquillaron el resultado en el tramo final. La derrota supone un paso atrás para el Tottenham, que inició la temporada de forma arrolladora. Los spurs se quedan a seis puntos de la cabeza que ostenta el Liverpool. Por su parte, el Brighton se queda en 30 puntos, a seis de los puestos europeos.",
