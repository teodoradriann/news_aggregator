    "text": "With Russell Wilson getting benched by the Denver Broncos and likely on the way out after the season, let's re-grade the blockbuster trade with the Seattle Seahawks from last year.\nBy Scott Rogust | 1:27 PM EST\nSep 12, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson (3) scrambles away / Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Denver Broncos had finally hoped to solve their quarterback problem ever since Peyton Manning retired after the team's Super Bowl 50 win in 2016. The team pulled off a blockbuster trade with the Seattle Seahawks for quarterback Russell Wilson in exchange for multiple players and high draft picks. The Broncos were so confident in Wilson's ability to bring them back to relevancy in the AFC West that they signed him to a five-year, $242.58 million contract before he even played a down for them.\nLess than two years later, his tenure with the Broncos is coming to an end. Wilson is being benched for Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the season. With that, the expectation from Wilson is that he will be cut by the team this upcoming March .\nWith the Wilson era coming to an end, let's take a look back at the trade.\nNFL trade grades: Re-grading the Broncos-Seahawks Russell Wilson trade Let's now look back at the full trade between the Broncos and Seahawks back in 2022, courtesy of ESPN senior NFL insider Adam Schefter.\nA look back at the Seattle-Denver trade: pic.twitter.com/v17msRCgJx\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 27, 2023 The Broncos acquired Wilson and a fourth-round pick in 2022, which turned into defensive lineman Eyiome Uwazurike. As for the Seahawks, they received quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, and five high draft picks in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the Seahawks selected offensive tackle Charles Cross (first-round), linebacker Boye Mafe (second-round), and Tyreke Smith (fifth-round, no longer on the team). This past year, the team used Denver's first-round pick (No. 5 overall) on Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon and the No. 37 overall pick on linebacker Derick Hall.\nNow, let's hand out new grades for the trade.\nBroncos Trade Re-Grade: F This may very well go down as one of the worst trades in recent NFL memory, and it can be attributed to the Broncos being desperate for a quarterback. In 2022, the team hired former Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett. The team watched as Aaron Rodgers stayed with the Packers that year, and the Broncos pivoted to acquiring Wilson, and gave up a fortune to get him. It was understandable, as Wilson was playing at a high level with the Seahawks.\nBut perhaps the biggest mistake that the Broncos made was giving Wilson a contract extension, despite the fact he never played a snap for the team and wasn't set to become a free agent until after the 2023 season. What was the hurry?\nThe decision backfired tremendously, as the Hackett-led Broncos were inept on offense, including Wilson. After 15 games, with the team drastically underperforming expectations, Hackett was fired. The Broncos' next big decision was to find a head coach who could get the most out of Wilson. Their answer was Sean Payton, who they acquired from the New Orleans Saints in exchange for a 2023 first-round pick and a 2024 second-round pick.\nFor the most part, Wilson has played infinitely better this season than in 2022. In 15 games, Wilson threw for 3,075 yards, 26 touchdowns (tied for sixth-most in NFL), and eight interceptions while completing 66.4 percent of his passes.\nBut, based on Wilson's benching and subsequent reporting, the Broncos are ready to find another option at the quarterback position. NFL Network national insider Ian Rapoport reported that the team was considering benching Wilson for the final two games due in part to him being owed $37 million for the 2025 season that becomes fully guaranteed this upcoming March, and an injury would complicate matters for them. As in, they wouldn't be able to move on from him before the 2025 salary becomes fully guaranteed.\nAll in all, the Broncos tried their best to find a steady option at the quarterback position. But after less than two years and two different head coaches, Wilson's time in Denver is nearing its end after his benching.\nSeahawks trade re-grade: A It's hard for an NFL team to move on from their franchise quarterback that did help them win their first-ever Super Bowl title. But for the Seahawks, they decided it was time to move on from Wilson and the Broncos were interested in his services. The Broncos may have pulled off the heist of the century in the NFL.\nIn 2022, the Seahawks placed their trust in Geno Smith to succeed Wilson, and it paid off. The Seahawks exceeded fan and media expectations, going 9-8 and clinching a Wild Card spot, with Smith winning Comeback Player of the Year. The Seahawks watched the Broncos go 5-12 and that first-round pick acquired turn into No. 5 overall.\nThis year, the Seahawks are still in the middle of the playoff hunt. Oh, and Lock helped keep their playoff hopes alive as he helped lead the team to a 20-17 upset win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 15.\nLooking at the first-round picks the Seahawks acquired, they selected Cross in the first round in 2022, who has so far played better than Evan Neal and Ikem Ekwonu, both of whom were selected ahead of him. Then, in 2023, they used their first-rounder on Witherspoon, who was one of the top cornerback prospects in the draft and fit the mold for the Seahawks' desire to rebuild the \"Legion of Boom\" defense. Thus far, Witherspoon has played like a top contender for the Defensive Rookie of the Year.\nThe Seahawks are the easy winners of the trade, and get an A grade rather easily.\ndark. Next.

    "text": "LEHI, UT, UNITED STATES, December 28, 2023 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- This December, hair-cutting chain Sport Clips formally partnered with nonprofit Saprea in the fight against child sexual abuse. Inspired by famed college football coach Lou Holtz, Sport Clips is committed to “do [their] best, do what’s right, and treat others the way they want to be treated”. To Sport Clips, this partnership with Saprea aligns with those values by helping to build a safe and supportive community for survivors of child sexual abuse while also raising awareness of this worldwide epidemic.\nSaprea is a nonprofit dedicated to liberating individuals and society from child sexual abuse and its lasting impacts through healing, prevention, and community education. Information about their expansive resources will now be available in each of Sport Clips’ 1800+ stores and as part of the chain’s onboarding program.\n“The partnership between Saprea and Sport Clips is evidence of the power that comes from community members getting involved in our cause,” said Saprea Managing Director Chris Yadon. “What started as an effort by one Saprea supporter has now grown into a massive effort to reach survivors and encourage healing and prevention across the U.S. and Canada.”\nSport Clips employees will now learn about Saprea resources during their onboarding and can reference more information about these resources in their store backrooms. In addition, Sport Clips has a Memorial Fund (nonprofit that supports employees in difficult situations) that will provide help with travel for employees who want to attend the\nSaprea Retreat but cannot afford the cost of travel. The Saprea Retreat is a free, clinically informed four-day experience for survivors of childhood sexual abuse that teaches survivors about the impacts of trauma, provides opportunities to apply healing tools, and builds a community of support.\nSaprea will also be joining several events like the Sport Clips Huddle (the national convention for employees) to provide even more information about prevention and healing resources.\nTo learn more about Saprea and the resources it provides or to get involved with spreading the message of hope and healing, visit\nsaprea.org.\nSarah Jensen\nSaprea\n+1 801-901-2461\nemail us here\nVisit us on social media:\nYouTube\nTikTok",

    "text": "On March 29, 2024, hundreds of Catholic devotees embarked on a spiritual journey up Mount Jumullong-Manglo , marking a significant observance of Good Friday . This annual pilgrimage, deeply rooted in faith and tradition, underscores the community's devotion and reflection on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\nAdvertisment The Pilgrimage: A Journey of Faith The trek up Mount Jumullong-Manglo on Good Friday has become a revered tradition for many of the island's Catholics. Participants undertake this physically demanding journey as a symbol of penance, prayer, and solidarity with the sufferings of Christ. The climb, often undertaken in silence or with prayers and hymns, provides a unique opportunity for introspection and spiritual renewal amidst the natural beauty of the mountain.\nGood Friday: Understanding Its Significance Advertisment Good Friday holds a central place in Christian theology, commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. This day is observed with solemnity and reverence across the globe, with various customs and traditions reflecting the diverse expressions of faith within the Christian community. References to the significance of Good Friday, its historical and theological roots, are well-documented and provide insight into why this day is observed with such profound respect and devotion ( see references 1, 2, and 3 ).\nReflections and Implications The annual pilgrimage up Mount Jumullong-Manglo is not just a physical journey but a manifestation of the enduring faith and commitment of the Catholic community to the principles of sacrifice, redemption, and forgiveness as exemplified by Jesus Christ. It serves as a poignant reminder of the power of faith to unite, inspire, and transform. As participants descend the mountain, they carry with them not just the memories of the journey but a renewed spirit to live out the teachings of Christ in their daily lives.\nThis event, set against the backdrop of Good Friday, invites reflection on the broader implications of such expressions of faith in today's world. It challenges observers and participants alike to consider the ways in which devotion, tradition, and community can intersect to create moments of profound spiritual significance and collective identity.",

    "text": "New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman used an incomplete quote at a briefing — drawing a delusional and absurd response from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt .\nOver the weekend, Trump Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Face The Nation host Margaret Brennan that “we are going to replace the armies of millions of people – well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.”\n“It’s going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They’re going to be mechanics. There’s going to be HVAC specialists. There’s going to be electricians,” Lutnick said.\nThe quote went viral on social media — but many seized on the first part to suggest that Lutnick envisions sweatshop jobs, rather than the absurd idea that America will prosper taking care of the robots that will build the iPhones here. Previous waves of automation have failed to provide enough “robotcare” jobs for the Americans the robots replaced.\nAt Tuesday’s White House press briefing , Haberman read out only the first part of that quote, and asked Leavitt whether President Donald Trump believes an army of iPhone assemblers will shift to the United States.\nInstead of reading out the full quote and addressing the (admittedly delusional) thing that Lutnick actually said, Leavitt went with the shortened quote and responded in even more delusional fashion, telling Haberman that we “absolutely have the labor” and “the workforce” to transplant millions of sweatshop iPhone jobs:\nMAGGIE HABERMAN: Karoline, thanks.\nDoes the president endorse something that Howard Lutnick said on television this weekend, which was that the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that that kind of thing is going to be moving to the U.S.? Is that how the president envisions manufacturing shifting?\nAnd, if so, how long would that take roughly?\nLEAVITT: The president wants to increase manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America, but he’s also looking at advanced technologies. He’s also looking at A.I. and emerging fields that are growing around the world that the United States needs to be a leader in as well.\nSo there’s an array of diverse jobs, more traditional manufacturing jobs, as you discussed, but also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those. He wants them to come back home.\nMAGGIE HABERMAN: But iPhones specifically, is that something that he thinks is the kind of technology that can move to the U.S.?\nLEAVITT: Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the work force, we have the resources to do it. And, as you know, Apple has invested $500 billion here in the United States. So if Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change.\nThe exchange exposes a major weakness in a press secretary who is undoubtedly Trump’s favorite and most successful White House chief spokesperson to date. Leavitt has a complete mastery of the press briefing “vibe” that none of her predecessors can match, and that vibe-setting skill allows her to get away with a poor command of facts and preparation.\nBut a prepared press shop would have had Lutnick’s full quote flagged in the briefing book and a (relatively) more sensical response at the ready.\nOr maybe Trump really does believe there are millions of Americans anxious to turn iPhone screws for pennies. Stranger things have happened.\nWatch above via Face the Nation .",
