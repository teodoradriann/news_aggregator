    "text": "The Seven Last Words of Jesus Christ: A Gen Z’s take\nCEBU CITY, Philippines – The season of Lent, which includes the Holy Week, may be our chance to rediscover our faith in our Lord.\nAs someone who has been raised in a not-so-strict Catholic family, I admit that there are instances in which I sometimes lose my footing when it comes to my faith and religion.\nBut as I grew old, activities that often bring back life and excitement doesn’t work out as they did back in the day.\nHoly Week traditions: What is Visita Iglesia?\nHoly Week 2024: Understanding the Sacred Triduum\nI felt weak and tired as if I were floating around with no one to ground me in reality.\nFeeling embarrassed, I quietly looked back to our Lord and, as expected, he was there, smiling proudly for his child has returned.\nUnfolding Jesus’ Seven Last Words As the Holy Week unfolds, Christians worldwide turn their hearts and minds to the final moments of Jesus Christ on the cross.\nReflecting on the Seven Last Words Jesus spoke in this Holy season offers profound insights and spiritual nourishment.\nAs a 24-year-old young adult navigating the complexities of life in the modern world, these Words uniquely resonate with me, offering guidance, comfort, and hope.\nLet’s delve into the powerful Seven Last Words from the perspective of a young Cebuana Gen Z seeking meaning and purpose in today’s society.\n1. “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34) In a world often filled with judgment and condemnation, these words remind us of the transformative power of forgiveness.\nAs a young adult, I admit I encounter situations where forgiveness can feel daunting or impossible.\nEven though it’s hard, Jesus’ example inspires me to show kindness even when hurt or betrayed, acknowledging the humanity and capacity for change in others.\n2. “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43) Amidst suffering and despair, Jesus promises redemption and eternal life.\nIn a world where material wealth and instant satisfaction are often valued, and even I admit that I am often caught with these nasty webs. These words remind me of the lasting importance of faith and spiritual contentment.\nThey offer solace in times of uncertainty and point towards hope beyond the challenges of the present moment.\n3. “Woman, behold your son. Behold your mother.” (John 19:26-27) Jesus demonstrates care and compassion for those closest to Him, even in His final moments.\nThis act of entrusting His mother to the care of His beloved disciple speaks to the importance of community and support in times of trial.\nAs a young adult finding my way, I’m reminded of the importance of nurturing relationships and the support found in close bonds of love and solidarity.\nThough not blood-related, these connections feel like family, offering support through both good times and bad.\n4. “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46) These words express the depths of human anguish and despair, echoing the cries of those who feel abandoned or alone.\nAs a young person grappling with existential questions and the challenges of modern life, I find solace in the knowledge that even Jesus experienced moments of profound doubt and isolation.\nHis vulnerability invites me to bring my struggles before a loving, compassionate God who understands my pain.\n5. “I thirst.” (John 19:28) Jesus acknowledges His humanity and shares His experiences of suffering in His physical thirst.\nThese words serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy and solidarity with those who thirst for justice, compassion, and necessities.\nAs a young adult passionate about social justice and global solidarity, Jesus’ cry speaks to my desire to alleviate the suffering of others and work towards a more equitable world.\n6. “It is finished.” (John 19:30) With these words, Jesus declares that He has finished His mission on Earth and fulfilled God’s plan for salvation.\nAs someone still navigating the uncertainties of adulthood, I find reassurance in knowing that even in moments of apparent defeat or failure, purpose and meaning exist to be found.\nJesus’ declaration reminds me to trust the bigger picture and to remain steadfast in my faith, knowing that God will ultimately fulfill His promises.\n7. “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” (Luke 23:46) In his final breath, Jesus fully surrenders Himself to God’s will, trusting in divine providence and the promise of resurrection.\nAs a young adult striving to surrender control and embrace trust in God’s plan, these words inspire me to relinquish my fears and anxieties, placing my life and future in God’s loving hands.\nAs we journey through Holy Week and meditate on the Seven Last Words of Jesus, let us, as young adults, embrace the timeless wisdom and profound love contained within these utterances.\nEven though you may find yourself submerged in moments of doubt, temptation, and even godlessness, remember that the Lord will always be there, ready to take you back into His arms.",

    "text": "My Economics teacher commented how pleasantly surprised she was at my performance on her exam. My Mathematics instructor had the opposite response. If I cheated, upon seeing my outstanding performance on his test he asked. Surprisingly my Physics teacher had the same question while my History teacher was so pleased with my performance he had me read my essays out loud.\nWhy? She mentioned the integrity of Bolumbia and the belief that it lowered the experience for the 150 trainees in her class. Because the students of Bolumbia would be getting credit whereas the other eager students would simply be, I described to her that this would not be the case. well. finding out. I understand, novel thought. learning without credit? What's the point? She said to me that while the concept of viral education with a price tag was luring that leading brass at Ivy League schools could never support something like this. Hmm. Why? Worry? Perhaps. Elitism? More likely.\nWhy is that a few of us have top priorities that make us pursue continued growth while other are content simply to let life pass them by? Well as you may guess the chance expense is all relative to the beholder. Some individuals carry out in reality worth \"vegging out\" in front of the T.V. much greater then they do checking out a book, or finding out something brand-new, or perhaps having great sex! We may question why would they choose this over that, however as you understand by now that is all reliant on where the chooser positions worth in their life.\nIn a significant FINRA research study of investors, 10 questions were developed to determine investor savvy. 65% of investors thought their portfolios were guaranteed, of the 10 concerns, no group of participants scored more than 50% correct. They would be stopping working school if your kids scored that low on their tests. Over two-thirds of participants (69%) explained themselves as being \"somewhat well-informed\" about the market. The glimmer of hope in the study: 97% of respondents wanted to find out more about investments and finances.The trick is to be sincere. Lots of parents have a problem with this, not wanting their kids to know that they remain in monetary distress. But, not only is this the worst time to go into more financial obligation, it is likewise the best time to give your kids, and your partner, if needed, a lesson in economics. You don't need to \"lay everything on the line\", but you can talk about the need to save and how it hurts you to enter into debt and how this Christmas might not be rather what they had actually planned. You can even take this chance to discuss the basics of interest on your charge card, which is probably greater than its ever been.|We treated our financial cancer \"episodes\" like strep throat-- an intense illness rather of the chronic, systemic one it really is. Every time we have actually \"treated\" the symptom, the illness has returned bigger and stronger. My grandmother would say, \"Stop callin' that feline with the black stripe a cat! I smell skunk!\" Meaning, we are not properly identifying the issue.}\nOne of the hardest courses that I took while going to college was government/economics. It wasn't that I had a hard teacher or that I couldn't use myself, nevertheless, it was the truth that maturing I was never motivated to think about federal government and the economics part of life. The course that I took was extremely helpful to my learning economics of how cash works. It also helped me comprehend that finance and market inflation wasn't simply a thing in America, but something that was connected on a global level. We all played a part in each other's nations success whether it is for good or bad. Among my professors would always state, \"If you desire money, you need to understand how to handle it, spend it and save it.\" That was a life-altering lesson that everyone\nBooks you should read ought to comprehend.\nUnderstanding the fundamentals assists you make sense of all the rest. If you are studying economics, for example, you need to comprehend supply and need. Then it is much easier to comprehend how great weather condition can depress commodity prices, or how government costs can drive rates up.\nIf you find out the skills, you can quickly make $20,000 to $40,000 a year - which's simply working part-time. A thorough sewing maker repair course can teach you all the fundamentals you require to know to set up your own sewing maker repair store in your garage or basement workshop. Gamble on discovering a required skill and launch your own sewing device repair service in no time at all.",
