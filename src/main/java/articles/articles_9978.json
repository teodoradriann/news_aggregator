    "text": "Police officer in Ohio on administrative leave after punching Miami University football player during arrest\nBy Jamiel Lynch, CNN\n(CNN) — An Oxford, Ohio, police officer seen punching a Miami University football player during a November arrest outside a local bar has been placed on administrative leave during an investigation, police say.\nThe student, identified by family as Devin Johnson, entered Brick Street bar through an exit-only gate, pushing past a female employee on November 18, according to a Facebook\npost by Oxford police.\nWhen the manager of the bar confronted Johnson, he was assaulted, according to police. Johnson then refused to leave the bar and an altercation occurred outside the establishment, the post said.\n“When the officer arrived at the scene, he observed the individual resisting and he was unable to complete the arrest until additional officers were able to assist in getting him into handcuffs,” the post added.\nCNN has reached out to police for the incident report and additional comment.\nJohnson, a 20-year-old defensive back for the Miami RedHawks, was arrested and charged with resisting arrest, assault, criminal trespass and underage intoxication. Johnson has pleaded not guilty to the charges, his attorney told CNN. His case has been set for trial in February, according to court records.\nIn surveillance video circulating on social media, Johnson can be seen outside the bar with several other people. Johnson and one of the men are seen struggling and Johnson is pinned on the ground by at least three people before police arrive.\nAn officer arrives on scene as the people have Johnson on the ground. The officer can be seen attempting to hold Johnson on the ground and appears to punch him three times. They continue to hold Johnson down as another officer arrives on scene. Both officers can be seen forcibly holding Johnson’s head, one of them pulling him by the hair at one point, before placing handcuffs on him.\nJohnson’s attorney, Ryan Agee, called the video “deeply disturbing” in a statement to the\nMiami Student earlier this week.\nIn a Thursday statement to CNN, Agee said, “To date, there has been a concerning lack of communication from the Oxford City Police Department and those conducting the use of force investigation. Given the department’s public statements post-incident and their seeming oversight of critical details, we firmly believe that an independent, external investigation is not only justified but essential to uphold the trust and confidence of the community and the Johnson family in the investigative process.”\nAddressing the video in a\nFacebook post on Monday, Oxford police said their initial investigation “did not include this video angle.”\nThe officer involved in the incident, Matthew Blauvelt, is on paid administrative leave during the investigation, according to Oxford Police Chief John Jones. CNN was unable to reach Blauvelt for comment.\nA statement from\nMiami University said it was aware of the “disturbing video” and had reached out to the student. The university has also “contacted the City of Oxford to learn more about this incident and to express our deep concerns about what occurred,” it said.\nMayor William Snavely said in a statement to CNN, “This is a very unusual and unfortunate event for Oxford. Clearly, the City does not condone excessive use of force. The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave and a full investigation is underway. We intend for that investigation to be fair, transparent, and concluded as soon as possible.”\nWhen reached for comment on the incident, a representative from Brick Street said they did not have a comment at this time.\nIn a Tuesday\nInstagram post, the establishment said, in part, “The video is disturbing, especially for Devin and family members. We are grateful that Devin and our crowd manager did not require any medical attention and that Devin was released at the police station shortly after the incident. Regardless, it does not change the fact that this portion of the video is disturbing and has evoked emotions.”\n“We look forward to an opportunity to meet with Devin after the break. These situations can happen in seconds when emotions are high and quickly spiral. Good people can get caught in the middle of unfortunately (sic) circumstances,” it added.\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Six Things You Didn’t Know About St. Thomas Becket",
    "text": "December 29 is the Feast of St. Thomas Becket, the great English martyr. Becket was murdered in 1170 by four knights in the service of King Henry II of England. Becket had once been Chancellor of the realm and a supporter of Henry, whom the king had elevated to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162. The appointment backfired on Henry, however, as Becket swiftly came into conflict with the king over the rights of the Church.\nAfter Becket excommunicated several of Henry’s supporters in the winter of 1170, King Henry, from his castle at Bur in Bayeaux, France, expressed his desire that someone would rid him of his meddlesome opponent. Four of Henry’s vassals—the knights William de Tracy, Reginald Fitzurse, Hugh de Moreville, and Richard le Bret—took the king at his word, and, making their way to Canterbury, confronted Becket and murdered him in the cathedral on the night of December 29. Becket was later canonized as a martyr, becoming one of the most popular saints of the Middle Ages. King Henry II was compelled to do public penance for the killing by being scourged at Becket’s tomb.\nSuch is the story most of us are familiar with. There is, however, much more to the tale of St. Thomas Becket, much of which you may not be familiar with. In a story as popular as Becket’s it is inevitable that much has been obscured by legend, hagiography, and even Hollywood. In this article, we will set the record straight with six things you likely didn’t know about St. Thomas Becket.\n1. Becket Was Not a Layman When He Was Appointed Archbishop\nThere is a common misconception that St. Thomas Becket ascended to the Archiepiscopal throne immediately from the lay state. This no doubt reflects the influence of the popular 1964 film Becket starring Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole. In the movie, Thomas Becket (Burton) is depicted as a layman and companion of King Henry II (O’Toole). In order to consolidate his control over the Church, King Henry proposes making his layman buddy into the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nWhile this certainly adds to the dramatic narrative of the film, it is unhistorical. In reality, St. Thomas Becket had already entered Holy Orders before filling any secular office. He had spent some time at the cathedral school of St. Paul’s as a young man and also did a year at the University of Paris, where he would have certainly taken Minor Orders. In 1154 he entered Major Orders with his ordination to the diaconate and was created Archdeacon of Canterbury by Theobald of Bec, the current Archbishop of Canterbury. As archdeacon, St. Thomas was the highest cleric in the diocesan government outside the archbishop himself. Becket held this position for eight years before he was elevated to the Archiepiscopate upon Theobald’s death, so he was hardly a layman at the time of his appointment.\n2. It Was a Bishop Who First Suggested Killing Becket\nWe know that the four knights who killed St. Thomas Becket did so after King Henry II, in a paroxysm of rage, exclaimed, “Won’t someone rid me of this troublesome priest?” There is considerable dispute over Henry’s actual words, but every source agrees that he made some comment to this effect, which prompted Fitzurse, Tracy, Moreville, and le Bret to go kill the archbishop. What is not so well-known is that it was actually a bishop who first planted the idea of killing Becket in the king’s mind.\nAs King Henry brooded about his French castle of Bur over the Christmas holiday, he frequently queried his vassals about how to handle the Becket situation. In his company were many knights and nobles, but also three English archbishops, those of York, London, and Salisbury, all of whom considered themselves Becket’s opponents. After discussing the matter at length, the Archbishop of York, Roger de Pont L’Évêque, said to Henry, “Ask counsel from your barons and knights; it is not for us to say what must be done,” then pausing for dramatic effect, the prelate added, “as long as Thomas lives, you will have neither good days, nor peaceful kingdom, nor quiet life.” It was this comment which threw King Henry into the fury wherein he uttered his famous line. Archbishop Roger hated Becket; the saint had excommunicated him earlier that month for participating in what Becket believed to be an illicit coronation of Henry’s son. Roger’s words were clearly meant to plant the idea of assassination in Henry’s mind without calling for it directly.\n3. King Henry Tried to Stop the Knights Who Went to Kill Becket\nThe exact culpability of King Henry II in Becket’s murder has long been disputed, going right back to the time of the killing. When Henry muttered his famous line, “Won’t someone rid me of this troublesome priest?” (or some variant thereof) what did he really mean? Was he really pleading with his retainers to go murder the problematic archbishop? Or was he merely venting his frustration in emotive hyperbole?\nA strong argument can be made that Henry did not, in fact, intend for anyone to harm Becket. Evidence for this is in the behavior of the king and the four knights after their departure from Henry’s court at Bur. While making their way to the coast to sail for Canterbury, the four knights split up and took four separate routes. If they considered themselves to be carrying out the king’s will, why would they have taken the precaution of traveling separately? Presumably they feared Henry would suspect their motive and try to stop them, which in fact he did. As soon as Henry realized the four knights had departed, he swiftly dispatched three couriers to intercept them and bring them back to Bur. The three couriers were unable to find them, however, and arrived at the coast after the four had already crossed the Channel. This suggests that Henry either never meant to go through with killing Becket or had thought better of it, since he attempted to halt the knights from crossing back to England.\n4. The Knights Did Not Intend to Kill Becket at First\nThough the four knights came to Canterbury fully armed and prepared for violence, it appears that killing Becket was not their initial plan of action. When they first arrived at Canterbury Cathedral, they left their weapons outside, going in merely to talk with Becket—a strange course of action for anyone bent on assassination!\nTheir first encounter with Becket was during dinner, but the conversation went poorly and got heated, and they went out to retrieve their weapons. Even then, it does not seem that murder was their intent, but rather kidnapping. When they accosted Becket again, they exclaimed, “Come with us—you are our prisoner!” and attempted to carry him off forcibly. They even attempted to place him upon their shoulders to haul him away! Their plan seems to have been to drag him over to France to hand over to King Henry. It was only when Becket resisted that they began striking him with their weapons, subsequently killing him.\n5. Becket Was Killed in a Tussle\nHagiography has depicted Becket docile and passive, hands folded in prayer, being stabbed from behind. This is far from the truth. In reality, Becket died in the midst of a tussle.\nBeing resolved to kidnap Becket, the knights tried dragging him forcibly from the chapel. One of them, Reginald Fitzurse, grabbed Becket by the cloak. Becket wrenched his cloak from the man’s grasp, calling Fitzurse a “detestable fellow.” The other knights piled on, attempting to pick Becket up and put him on Hugh de Tracy’s shoulders so he could be carried off. Becket fought vehemently, saying he would never be parted from his church, and pounded his fists against the man, causing them both to fall to the pavement. Becket called them “wretches” and shouted that he must not be touched, after which, in fury, Fitzurse swung his blade at Becket’s head, taking off his cap. The other knights followed, striking Becket mortally multiple times. Becket commended his life to God, St. Denis, and St. Alfege before expiring. He was anything but passive at the moment of his martyrdom; rather, we see him killed in a struggle with his attackers, who seemed bent on kidnapping him at first.\n6. Becket Was Not Killed Praying at the Altar\nSt. Thomas Becket was killed during the liturgical office of Vespers. It is common in hagiography therefore to depict St. Thomas Becket praying at the altar at the time of his martyrdom. This is historically inaccurate. Becket was not killed at the altar of Canterbury. Rather, he was murdered standing in front of a pillar at the base of a staircase in the transept of a side altar dedicated to St. Benedict. Becket confronted his murderers before this pillar; here he tussled with Tracy and Fitzurse, and here he was struck down. The confusion over the location of his death is due to the fact that, years after his martyrdom, the chapel was renovated, and an altar erected at the spot of his murder. This led future generations of pilgrims to assume that Becket was killed at the altar, when in fact the altar was intentionally placed on the site of Becket’s martyrdom after the fact.\nA Great Resource on Becket\nIf you found any of this interesting, you might want to check out\nThe Murder of Becket and the Canterbury Shrine by Arthur Penrhyn Stanely (Cruachan Hill Press, 2022), from which I drew the material for this article. This is an older book, written in the 19th century by an English scholar during the height of the historical revival of the Victorian era. I was privileged to edit and layout a new hardcover edition from Cruachan Hill Press, that this gem of scholarship should not be lost to today’s audience. Beginning only a month before Becket’s death, the book reads like a 12th century true crime story, taking the reader through the last days and hours of Becket’s life in extreme detail. It also contains fascinating sections on the fate of Becket’s murderers and the history of the Canterbury shrine that emerged as part of Becket’s growing cultus. With an original introduction by Ryan Grant, The Murder of Becket and the Canterbury Shrine is a must-have for anyone interested in the life of the great English martyr.

    "text": "Published: Aug. 30, 2024, 12:03 a.m.\nFamily home. Dreamstime\nBy R. Eric Thomas Dear Eric: I have an adult daughter who moved out but does not want me to change her former bedroom.\nShe had a breakup seven years ago that caused a nervous breakdown because of the cruel way it was done: packing her things up and mailing them to our house. She moved back in with us as a result of this breakup and started therapy.\nAfter many years of therapy, she is on the road to recovery. The depression has lifted. Working, the apartment, an increasingly good social life.\nYet, she has trouble letting go. Whenever I mention that I want to redo her former room as a guest/sewing room for me, she gets upset. I have explained that eventually I will probably sell the house and downsize, and she started talking about robbing her of inherited wealth. I am still working and want to retire and cannot do so by keeping and maintaining the house.\nMy husband, her father, died last year, and while we all are grieving still, she took it the hardest as they were extremely close. I do not want to give her any anxiety, yet I feel imprisoned by her needs for everything to stay the same. It is as though her breakdown, and my husband’s death have put me on a life path I do not want.\n— Imprisoned by the Past\nDear Past: While your daughter may feel powerless against her anxiety and grief, she has a responsibility not to wield either against you.\nI’m particularly alarmed by her protests around selling the house. The inherited wealth objection sounds like moving the goalpost. While it may be masking other complicated feelings of grief and loss, this is still your house. Your money is yours to do with as you choose.\nSee if she and her therapist are open to having you join a few sessions so that you can have a mediated conversation about her feelings, your feelings and how to move forward. You are not giving her anxiety by making choices in your own life or closing the museum that is her childhood bedroom. You can tell her that, with love. And her therapist can help her process it.\nI also hope that you are able to have therapy of your own or attend a grief support group. You’re dealing with a lot, internally and externally. Talking with others can help you figure out what’s yours to hold on to and what you can let go of.\n(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

    "text": "Patienten, die in die UCCK-Kliniken eingeliefert wurden, waren gezwungen, sich einige grundlegende Medikamente selbst zu beschaffen. Sie berichteten von einem Mangel an Glukose, Antibiotika, Vitaminen, Albumin und sogar einigen Krebsmedikamenten.\nIm University Clinical Center (UCC) wurde ein Mangel an einer Reihe wichtiger und grundlegender Medikamente festgestellt.\nEltern von Kindern, die in der Kinderklinik stationär behandelt wurden, berichteten am Mittwoch über den Mangel an verschiedenen physiologischen Lösungen und sogar Antibiotika.\nUnter der Bedingung der Anonymität erklärten sie, dass sie mit dieser Situation konfrontiert seien, seit die Kinder in die Klinik eingeliefert worden seien.\n„Wir haben auf jeden Fall Glukose gekauft, für jeden Tag zwei Stück – Glukose, Ceftriaxon, das ist ein Antibiotikum“, sagte einer von ihnen.\n„Medikamente, Infusionen“, sagte ein anderer Elternteil über die Medikamente, die er für sein im Krankenhaus liegendes Kind kaufen musste.\nEine ähnliche Situation mit Medikamentenmangel herrscht auch in anderen Kliniken. Patienten, die in der Chirurgischen Klinik behandelt wurden, berichteten von einem Mangel an bestimmten Produkten.\nIn diesem Arzneimittelrezept wurden einem Patienten am Mittwoch vier Produkte zum Kauf in privaten Apotheken verschrieben, darunter Ringer-Lösung, Vitamin B-Komplex, ein Antibiotikum und Albumin.\n„Wir haben alle Infusionen gekauft. Sie sagten: ‚Es gibt keine.‘ Wir sind hingegangen und haben sie gekauft“, sagte ein Familienmitglied eines Patienten.\n„Ich habe ein Antibiotikum gekauft“, sagte ein Familienmitglied eines anderen Patienten.\nUnd ein Familienmitglied des Patienten gab bekannt, wie viel Geld er tagsüber für Medikamente ausgab.\n„64 Euro“, sagte er.\nIm Laufe des Tages antworteten UCCK und SHSKUK nicht auf Fragen zum Grund des Mangels an Glukose, Albumin und Antibiotika.\nKOHA hatte bereits Anfang des Jahres über den Glukosemangel berichtet. Im März gab SHSKUK bekannt, einen Vertrag über die Lieferung dieses Produkts in 100 und 500 Millilitern unterzeichnet zu haben. Trotzdem mussten Patienten, wie KOHA erfuhr, dieses Medikament monatelang kaufen.\nPatienten der Onkologischen Klinik berichteten auch von Medikamentenmangel. Einer sagte, letzte Woche habe ein Knochenmedikament gefehlt, als er es erhalten sollte, und er sei gezwungen gewesen, es zu kaufen.\n„Ich nehme Zometan alle vier Wochen. Es gibt einen Engpass. Zometan habe ich zum Beispiel für 25 Euro gekauft“, sagte er.\nUm das Medikament „Zometa“ zu sichern, unterzeichnete ShSKUK am 7. April einen Liefervertrag. Diese Institution hat den Grund für den Mangel nicht angegeben, obwohl sie einen Vertragsbetreiber hat.",

    "title": "a brigitte bardot parte la frizione:il papa è maleducato',i musulmani stanno distruggendo la francia",
    "text": "Estratto da www.lastampa.it L’attrice-icona Brigitte Bardot torna a scagliarsi contro l’Islam. In passato aveva addirittura ricevuto sei multe per islamofobia e scritto una lettera al primo ministro Nicolas Sarkozy, definendo i musulmani una «popolazione che sta distruggendo il nostro Paese imponendo i suoi atti», aveva riferito la Bbc. L’indignazione ha una radice precisa: il trattamento disumano che i musulmani hanno nei confronti degli animali. Ora è tornata sul tema in un’intervista a Valeurs Actuelles: «Un tempo avrei detto che non volevo vivere in una Francia islamizzata. Oggi dico che non voglio morire in una Francia islamizzata!» ha dichiarato. […] Le sue parole sono dure e dirette: «Gli assassini sono spesso di origine islamica e lo rivendicano! In gran parte, sono purtroppo dei français de papier e spesso degli psicopatici. Dovremmo fare un esame psichiatrico a tutti i migranti che entrano prima di concedere loro il diritto d’asilo e la nazionalità francese», afferma. Non risparmia critiche anche a Papa Francesco: «Non lo posso vedere. Fa molto male alla Chiesa. Io adoravo Giovanni Paolo II, mi ricordo del nostro bell’incontro, unico, molto caloroso, lui non era affatto un politico. Non incontrerò mai l’attuale Papa. Non si occupa dei cristiani d’Oriente e non ne parla mai. Quando ho saputo che si sarebbe chiamato Francesco, mi sono detta piena di speranza: se ha scelto questo nome, è perché ama gli animali. Gli ho inviato una lettera per congratularmi e ringraziarlo per aver scelto quel nome in onore di San Francesco d’Assisi. Speravo finalmente che avrebbe fatto qualcosa in più per migliorare la sorte degli animali nel mondo, ma non mi ha mai risposto. Gli ho inviato un’altra lettera, e mi ha fatto rispondere da un suo servitore, che mi ringraziava. Trovo dunque che sia molto maleducato».",

    "title": "España y Portugal, grandes posicionados para sacar tajada del mercado de hidrógeno verde alemán",
    "text": "El estudio señala las reticencias de Francia a cofinanciar la infraestructura desde la Península Ibérica\nAlemania podría responder a más del 10% de sus necesidades estimadas de energía para 2035 mediante la importación a través de ductos de hasta 100 teravatios hora (Twh) de hidrógeno verde, de los que casi la tercera parte procederían de España y Portugal, según las proyecciones contempladas en un estudio publicado por el ‘think tank’ alemán Agora Energiewende.\nSegún las estimaciones realizadas, para mediados de la próxima década, Alemania podrá importar entre 64 y 100 TWh de hidrógeno verde al año a través de tuberías, aunque para alcanzar el máximo potencial sería necesario recurrir a los corredores del sur de Europa y el norte de África, lo que exige acuerdos con los países de tránsito y, si es necesario, apoyo de los países exportadores para reducir los costes de financiación.\nEn este sentido, los autores apuntan que los ductos desde los países del mar Báltico y del Norte no pasan por países de tránsito, por lo que requieren menos esfuerzo de coordinación y pueden implementarse más rápidamente. De hecho, la conexión con Dinamarca y Noruega ya será posible en 2030, mientras que para 2035 se podrán realizar más conexiones con Alemania.\nDe tal modo, en un escenario con la implementación y el desarrollo de las medidas al ritmo actual, el informe proyecta que las cantidades importadas alcanzarían para 2025 los 64 Twh, de los que 28 Twh procederían de las conexiones nórdicas, mientras que unos 18 Twh lo harían del sur de Europa, principalmente desde España.\nSin embargo, en un escenario con un nivel de ambición significativamente mayor, las cantidades disponibles de hidrógeno se pueden aumentar hasta los 100 Twh mediante la implementación de los acuerdos necesarios sobre financiación y planificación de los corredores en los próximos años.\nEstas medidas permitirán que más países se conecten con Alemania a través de tuberías, permitiendo importar hasta 32 Twh desde la Península Ibérica, con 21 Twh desde España y otros 11 Twh desde Portugal, frente a los 37 Twh del mar del Norte y los 14 Twh estimados desde el mar Báltico.\nEn el caso de las conexiones con los países del sur de Europa, el informe señala el carácter «central» de la conexión con Francia y la considerable oposición a la construcción de una conexión terrestre a través de los Pirineos Orientales, al tiempo que destaca la alternativa submarina prevista entre Barcelona y Marsella (BarMar como parte de H2Med) prevista, cuya pronta finalización supone un aspecto «clave».\nEn este sentido, el ‘think tank’ defiende la necesidad de garantizar volúmenes de compra a largo plazo a un precio predecible para garantizar que los proyectos de generación puedan financiarse y tomar decisiones de inversión apropiadas y advierte de que financiar los corredores internacionales necesarios «es casi imposible sin apoyo regulatorio».\n«Para que las importaciones de hidrógeno por gasoducto sean una realidad para mediados de la década de 2030, se necesita una solución pronto al problema de financiación», afirman, añadiendo que, para lograrlo, los países involucrados deben entablar rápidamente negociaciones para aclarar la priorización de los corredores y la distribución de la financiación.\nEn el caso de los corredores que atraviesan varios países, incluidos los dos corredores del sur, advierten de que se requieren «soluciones más complejas» y admiten que financiar el corredor suroeste, con Francia como país de tránsito, «será un desafío», ya que, al ser poco probable que el país galo dependa de las importaciones de hidrógeno, o sólo lo haga en pequeña medida, «podría estar menos dispuesto a cofinanciar un corredor para el suministro alemán».\nPor otro lado, el estudio advierte de que, si bien los ductos son la opción de transporte más barata para el hidrógeno puro en distancias cortas y medias, estas infraestructuras conllevan elevados costes de inversión inicial, que pueden reducirse si los gasoductos existentes se convierten a hidrógeno.\nTRANSPORTE DE HIDRÓGENO POR BARCO\nEn cuanto a la posibilidad de recurrir al transporte de hidrógeno puro por barco, incluyendo corredores marítimos como el impulsado por Cepsa con el puerto de Rotterdam para llevar hidrógeno por mar antes de que estén los hidroductos (H2Med), el estudio señala que esto permite una diversificación más sencilla de los proveedores y unos plazos de entrega potencialmente más cortos debido a procesos de aprobación más simples y, en parte, a la infraestructura ya existente.\nDe tal modo, el ‘think tank’ germano concluye que «la importación por barco puede ser adecuada para la implementación temprana de importaciones más pequeñas de hidrógeno puro», aunque defiende que, para cantidades mayores, es probable que la rentabilidad del transporte por tuberías supere las desventajas.",
