    "title": "I've Used Apple Notes for Years: Here Are the 8 Features It's Still Missing",
    "text": "Quick Links Apple Notes has been a great companion over the years, helping me jot down my thoughts and ideas. However, after several updates, it still lacks some features that could make it even better. 1 Official Plugins or Extensions There are several [reasons why Notes is the best note-taking app for Apple users](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-apple-notes-is-best-note-taking-app-for-apple-users/), chief among them being its simplicity. It's an out-of-the-box app that anyone can use easily. However, its simplistic approach and focus on the most basic note-taking features also means power users may find it lacking. That's where official support for plugins to extend its functionalities would be useful. Adding official support for extensions would allow anyone to customize Notes to fit their workflows while enjoying other benefits like the seamless integration with other Apple devices. In comparison, popular note-taking apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) come with advanced features by default and still offer plugin support for extensive customization. Although Apple Notes does not officially support plugins, there are some third-party add-ons, like [NotesCmdr](https://smallest.app/notescmdr/), that you can use to add several missing features like slash commands and templates. However, note that these add-ons are often created by independent developers and may not go through the same rigorous security checks that official plugins would. 2 Markdown Support Another Apple Notes limitation, compared to other note-taking apps, is its lack of support for Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you quickly add formatting to text, such as bold, italics, headings, and lists. Although Apple Notes supports some text formatting options, you will have to use its keyboard shortcuts or the formatting buttons in the toolbar. Luckily, if you rely heavily on Markdown, you can add this functionality to Apple Notes with an extension like [ProNotes](https://www.pronotes.app/). This free Apple Notes extension lets you use Markdown syntax in your notes. Alternatively, if you enjoy writing in Markdown, you can consider switching to other third-party note-taking apps like [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). 3 Integration With Other Third-Party Apps One of the main reasons why I still use Apple Notes is that it integrates seamlessly with other Apple devices. For instance, while I prefer typing on my Mac, I can quickly jot down notes on my iPhone, which accompanies me everywhere, and those notes sync effortlessly across my devices. I also enjoy using Siri to quickly take notes when I can't type. However, I sometimes wish Apple Notes could play nice with the other third-party tools I use daily. This restriction means I only use Notes for my personal needs because I can’t connect it to other apps I use for work. 4 Accessibility and Collaboration Outside Apple Devices One of the biggest limitations of Apple Notes is that it’s restricted to the Apple ecosystem. While it works seamlessly across my Mac and iPhone, it’s essentially locked out of any other non-Apple device. This means that there's no straightforward way to access my notes on my Android phone when I need to. However, there's a laborious workaround for non-Apple devices; you can [use iCloud on the web without an Apple device](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-icloud-web-only-access/) to access Notes. This limited accessibility also affects collaboration with non-Apple users. While [collaboration in Notes with other Apple users](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-collaborate-with-apple-notes/) is possible, it is limited compared to other tools. Plus, you are out of luck if you want to work on a note with a colleague or friend using a non-Apple device. In contrast, apps like [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) offer cross-platform support and more collaborative features. 5 Native Template Support Templates are a go-to feature for anyone who regularly needs preformatted note structures, as they eliminate the need to format each note type from scratch every time. Sadly, Apple Notes doesn't have a built-in template feature. If I want to create a specific format—like a meeting agenda or a recurring checklist—I have to manually recreate it each time, which is far from ideal because it adds extra steps that could easily be eliminated with built-in template functionality. Alternatively, you can duplicate an existing note each time you want to reuse a format. You can also use [ProNotes to supercharge the Notes app on your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/extension-to-supercharge-notes-app-on-mac/#use-pronotes-to-insert-templates). This extension adds several useful features including, slash commands and the ability to insert templates with a few keystrokes. 6 Version History The lack of version history is one of the biggest downsides of Apple Notes, especially considering its competition has this feature. With version history, you can restore a previous version of a note in case you make any accidental changes or want to revert to an older version. There's currently no way to access a prior version of a note in Apple Notes. However, if you accidentally delete a note in the last 30 days, you can find it in the Recently Deleted folder. In addition, you can use the undo shortcut (Command + Z) to revert any recent changes in a note. However, this won't work if you close the note and reopen it later. Beyond these workarounds, your best bet is to use other note-taking apps like Google Keep. [Keep lets you track changes with version history](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-keep-version-history/) and restore a previous version of a note if needed. 7 Whiteboard A whiteboard feature in a note-taking app can be incredibly valuable for visually connecting ideas, creating mind maps, or organizing thoughts, which can be especially helpful for brainstorming. You can use the Markup button in Notes on the iPhone or iPad to draw. However, this feature isn’t available on the Mac version of Notes, except for use on attached images or documents. You will have to rely on [Apple's Freeform on Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-freeform-app-explained/) or use other note-taking apps with whiteboards like [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). 8 Bi-Directional Linking You can use [Apple Notes to create links between your notes](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-link-to-notes-in-apple-notes-iphone/), which can help connect related information. However, these links are unidirectional by default, meaning they only point from one note to another without creating a reciprocal link back. Bi-directional linking, on the other hand, creates a two-way connection, allowing you to easily jump back and forth between notes. Bi-directional linking is extremely useful in note-taking and [personal knowledge management apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-personal-knowledge-management-tools-for-organizing-information/), helping you see connections and context between ideas. One way to replicate this feature in Apple Notes is by creating a link from one note to the next and a backlink from the second note to the first. This may not be as seamless as having a built-in bi-directional linking feature, but it can still help you connect your notes effectively. Alternatively, use ProNotes to view all the notes linked to a specific note. Apple Notes is a great note-taking app due to its ease of use and seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem. While it works exceptionally well for basic note-taking needs, it may not have all the advanced features other apps offer.",

    "text": "« Je suis détective privé voici les choses les plus folles que font les infidèles pour éviter de se faire prendre »\nNoémie Sadoun\nLeon Hart est détective privé depuis 15 ans. Et en 15 ans d’activité il en a vu des amants et des maîtresses. Aujourd’hui, il affirme que plus rien ne le surprend lorsqu’il s’agit d’infidélité.\nÊtre en couple c’est bien. Être fidèle, c’est mieux. Les personnes en couple et/ou mariées ne pourront que vous le confirmer, se faire tromper, c’est l’une des pires trahisons. Et pourtant, selon une étude menée par l’Institut Kinsey, environ 20% des hommes et 13% des femmes ont admis avoir été infidèles à leur partenaire au moins une fois dans leur vie. Cependant, ces chiffres peuvent varier selon la culture, l’âge, et d’autres facteurs.\nD’autres études suggèrent que la fréquence de l’infidélité peut augmenter au fil du temps dans une relation. Par exemple, une étude publiée dans le Journal of Marriage and Family a révélé que 25% des hommes et 15% des femmes étaient infidèles dans les cinq premières années de mariage, tandis que ces chiffres augmentaient respectivement à 33% et 19% après 20 ans de mariage.\nMais pour tromper son ou sa partenaire, certaines personnes peuvent avoir beaucoup d’imagination. Pour Mirror, Leon Hart, un détective privé a dévoilé les mensonges les plus incroyables de sa carrière.\nUne licence de pilote pour mieux se déplacer de maîtresse en maîtresse\nLeon Hart raconte qu’une de ses clientes soupçonnait son mari fortuné d’infidélité. Elle avait raison. Mais elle ne s’attendait vraiment pas à ça. Son mari lui avait caché qu’il avait en fait une licence de pilote et même un petit avion afin de pouvoir mieux se déplacer chez sa maîtresse.\nIl s’est avéré qu’il avait une liaison avec trois familles différentes à la fois, toutes dispersées sur les îles voisines, alternant entre les familles de manière égale pendant de nombreuses années.\nSelon une étude menée sur 2 000 personnes, 38% des infidèles inventent un décès dans leur famille afin de pouvoir partir sereinement chez leur amant. Les activités sportives et les voyages d’affaires sont les excuses les plus populaires, invoquées respectivement par 74% et 87% des personnes interrogées. Viennent ensuite les heures supplémentaires (70 %) et les obligations familiales (68 %).\nPourquoi tromper plutot que de quitter ?\nLouise Goddard-Crawley, psychologue, explique que si ces dissimulations semblent bizarres, les gens les utilisent pour toutes sortes de raisons.\nCertaines personnes préfèrent tromper leur partenaire plutôt que de les quitter parce qu’elles craignent les retombées émotionnelles d’une rupture. D’autres peuvent se sentir émotionnellement ou financièrement dépendants de leur partenaire, ce qui les empêche de mettre fin à la relation.\nDes problèmes de communication ou des conflits non résolus au sein de la relation peuvent conduire les individus à rechercher un épanouissement en dehors de celle-ci plutôt que d’aborder les problèmes directement.\nIl est primordial dans un couple d’exprimer ses besoins et ses désirs et ne pas laisser les non-dits s’accumuler et s’exposer à des frustrations qui pourraient pousser à chercher ailleurs ce que l’on n’ose pas demander au sein de son couple.\nSource :\nMirror\nLire aussi :\nSelon une étude, vous êtes plus favorable d’être infidèle si vous exercez un de ces 10 métiers",

    "text": "By Chinwendu Obienyi Nigeria’s leading brewers may be celebrating impressive first-quarter revenues in 2025, but behind the rising figures lies a sobering reality: beer consumption is steadily dwindling. Despite International Breweries, Nigerian Breweries (NB) Plc and Guinness Nigeria recording strong double-digit revenue growth, Daily Sun’s analysis reveals that actual profitability took a hit in Q1 2025. Collectively, the trio posted revenues of N683.16 billion, buoyed by multiple price increases, an expanded premium product range and aggressive marketing campaigns to defend market share in a fragile economy. Yet, net profits for the quarter dropped to N86.1 billion, down from N112.48 billion in the same period last year. Beneath the surface, the industry is grappling with significant volume declines, as rising inflation, a weakened naira, and shrinking disposable incomes dampen consumer demand. Even heavy marketing expenditure has done little to reverse the trend. In 2018, the big three spent nearly N60 billion on marketing, with Nigerian Breweries alone accounting for N24 billion. In early 2024, Nigerian Breweries implemented a series of price hikes in response to surging input costs and currency depreciation. However, the move has been met with dwindling demand as economic headwinds tighten household budgets. “Beer volume remains under pressure. The increased revenue is not driven by more people drinking beer, it is the result of higher prices compensating for falling sales,” a market analyst explained. Recent data from ReportLinker supports this view, revealing a decline in beer consumption per capita, from 8.36 kilograms in 2023 to a projected 7.56 kilograms by 2025. That’s a drop of over 5 percent, with further declines forecast through 2028. “The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for beer consumption is expected to fall by approximately 5.17 per cent annually over the next five years,” the report noted. A growing health-conscious segment, combined with rising interest in non-alcoholic alternatives, is also reshaping consumer preferences, contributing to the industry’s struggle. Meanwhile, cost of sales for the brewers reportedly dropped by 102.8 per cent during the quarter, reflecting broader operational adjustments. While strategic pricing and cost optimisation may support short-term profitability, analysts warn that long-term growth remains uncertain without a rebound in consumer demand. “Whilst Q1 2025 earnings lay a solid foundation for a more sustainable earnings path, maintaining profitability will depend on the sector’s ability to navigate cost pressures amid a still challenging macroeconomic environment,” analysts at Cordros Research noted. Often seen as a litmus test for middle-class spending, Nigeria’s beer industry is now at a crossroads, challenged to evolve with a more frugal, health-aware, and financially constrained consumer base, or risk stagnation in the years ahead.",
