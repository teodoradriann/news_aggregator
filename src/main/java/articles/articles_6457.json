    "text": "As its name suggests, the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut has the sea — or, rather, the Mystic River — right at its door. While the relationship between the museum and the river has been mostly harmonious, rising water levels are now prompting significant protective changes. Flooding at the museum site has been more frequent than ever. Historically, it might happen a few times a year. Now, flooding is a monthly or weekly occurrence, according to April reporting from the New York Times. First opening to the public in the 1930s , the museum was built on the Atlantic Ocean at the low-lying site of what once was a shipyard. Constructed on the water, it was not designed to withstand today's rising seas. At the moment, most of the museum's campus is considered a critical flood zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Even the highest points are only 14 feet above sea level, per the New York Times, making floods an inevitability. \"Flooding often submerges walkways throughout the campus,\" the paper noted , \"preventing visitors from accessing buildings and experiences.\" As noted by the Times, researchers expect sea levels in the area to rise 20 inches by 2050. \"It might not be 2050,\" Chad Frost told the publication, \"but this isn't a question of 'if,' but rather 'when.'\" The architectural expert has been collaborating with the museum for years, focusing on flood resilience since 2020. Rising sea levels primarily stem from human-caused pollution, which traps heat in our atmosphere and can cause Arctic ice melting and water to expand . In the context of the Mystic River shoreline, the higher water levels can supercharge flooding events, making them more frequent and more destructive. As temperatures increase worldwide, we can expect more intense climate shocks , including not only floods but also hurricanes and fires . Museums beyond Connecticut are making preparations to survive wildfires and extreme floods too. At the Louvre in Paris, France, artworks not on display can be stored off-site at a higher elevation, according to KRTV. Do you think your house could withstand a hurricane? No way Maybe a weak one I'm not sure It definitely could Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. \"This is a slow building crescendo that gets worse the longer we wait,\" Frost continued , referring to the peril at Mystic Seaport's doorstep. \"The clock is ticking,\" he added. The New York Times reported that, for the past five years, the museum has been implementing new methods for protecting its historical artifacts, including coastal barrier fortification and plans for building elevation. Specialists are also relocating some of the buildings. However, some operations are tied to the waterfront — like the historic watercrafts on display — and if coastal levels continue to rise, those materials could be lost or damaged. To protect the vulnerable Mystic River coast and so many others, we need to address the proliferation of heat-trapping pollution that exacerbates sea level rise and flooding events. Some steps you can take include lowering the amount of energy you consume that's fueled by burning dirty energy sources like oil, coal, and gas. Coordinating with your community can also maximize your impact. More actions to take at the community level include those similar to the efforts that Frost has helped the museum to pursue, like flood-risk assessment. Advocating for infrastructural plans and local investments to help make your neighborhood safer can reduce the costs — financial and otherwise — of flood recovery efforts down the line.

    "text": "George Stroumboulopoulos among 78 named to Order of Canada\n 6:00 am.\nLast Updated December 28, 2023 11:11 am.\nWhen George Stroumboulopoulos thinks back on his TV career, it’s his time hosting The NewMusic in the early 2000s that resonates most.\nMany Canadians remember how the gregarious host introduced them to bands and musicians on the MuchMusic program, and those years are part of the reason he is now being appointed to the Order of Canada.\n“It was this golden era of television that I don’t think could ever be created again,” he told The Canadian Press in an interview.\nStroumboulopoulos went on to host his own show on CBC for a decade, followed by a stint on Hockey Night in Canada from 2014 to 2016.\nHe has interviewed everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Hilary Clinton to Snoop Dogg — but he said he never changed along the way.\n“With very rare exceptions, I have been 100 per cent myself the whole way,” he said.\nStroumboulopoulos is one of 78 Canadians being awarded one of the country’s highest honours.\nThe list of new officers of the Order of Canada provided by the office of the Governor General includes Willie Adams, the first Inuit senator in Canada, guitar-maker Linda Manzer, editorial cartoonist Michael de Adder and pollster Nik Nanos.\nBeing promoted within the order are former MP and senator Serge Joyal, former MP, Cree chief and lawyer Wilton Littlechild and Dr. Ronald Stewart, who is recognized for his contributions to emergency medicine.\nWhen Susanne Craig found out she was receiving the honour, the journalist was in the middle of a Zoom call with editors, finishing up a story on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n“I couldn’t believe it,” she recalled in an interview. “And then I had to get right back on the call and close the story.”\nCraig’s journalism in recent years has been as high-profile as it gets, reporting on former U.S. president Donald Trump’s taxes for the New York Times.\nIt’s investigative work that earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2019, but it also came with challenges including death threats, and knowing that her work would be politicized.\n“I think you just have to stand your ground,” she said. “I always think, to me, it is about journalism, and I think you have to sort of feel at the end of the day that what you’re doing, it is about the reporting.”\nAlso receiving the honour is Francine Lemire, a doctor who represented Canada in the Paralympics in the ’80s.\n“In a way, it was a love story,” she said, describing her journey to the games.\nLemire is an above-the-knee amputee. Her now-husband “is a very good cross-country skier, and he is in fact the one who has been able to think through adjustments that would be required for me to be able to ski.”\nIn the 1984 games, she came in fourth in cross-country skiing. That’s the worst placing, she said — “you just missed out.”\n“One needs to learn what there’s to learn from that, and try and turn the page and get ready for the next race. And it’s never very easy,” Lemire said, adding it was an experience that taught her the importance of planning and resilience.\nFour years later, she won two gold medals at the 1988 Paralypmic Winter Games in Austria.\nLemire went on to practise as a family doctor in Corner Brook, N.L., for almost 25 years. And in 2022, she retired after 10 years as the president and CEO of the College of Family Physicians of Canada.\n“This recognition is also a validation for me of a lifetime commitment to family medicine both as a clinician, as well as organizationally,” she said.\nFamily doctors look after people from birth to death, and Lemire called it “an incredible privilege to be able to enter people’s lives for the little things and big things in their life, and make a contribution, even in a small way, to … a life worth living.”\nIn 2020, Flavio Volpe also found himself — improbably enough, as president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association — playing a part in the health care system.\nVolpe’s job has included initiatives like Project Arrow, the first Canadian-made electric vehicle, and helping renegotiate Canada’s trade agreement with the United States and Mexico.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in March 2020, there was “a dangerous shortage of critical medical goods” such as personal protective equipment and ventilators.\n“We led a call here, the first in this country, of converting manufacturing from auto parts to PPE and ventilators. And we were successful in mobilizing what I think is the greatest peacetime mobilization of Canadian manufacturing history.”\nVolpe, who is on the list of appointees to the order, describes it as his most fulfilling project.\n“We didn’t do it for money. It certainly was a terrible time financially for everybody,” he said. “But when everybody was afraid, this industry stepped up and I’m proud to have – I want to say this humbly – I’m proud to have led that.”\nLino Saputo, another business personality being recognized by the Governor General, followed in his father’s footsteps to take the reins of his family’s eponymous cheese and dairy products company.\nWhen Saputo was founded in Montreal in 1954, its products were delivered via bicycle. Now it’s one of the biggest dairy processors in the world.\n“It’s not always that simple, as a third generation in a family business, to bring it to different a new level or new heights,” Saputo said.\nUnder his watch, the company has expanded, growing in the United States and moving into Argentina, Australia and the U.K.\n“We’ve maintained that family spirit, we’ve maintained the focus on people, and that’s not always easy to do when you’re dealing with different countries and different cultures.”\nSaputo is also being honoured for his philanthropy. He said he’s especially proud of a decade volunteering with United Way Centraide Canada.\nSaputo said he hopes that “the involvement that I’ve had, both in business and in the community, that I’ve had the ability to change peoples’ lives for the better. That’s really been my mission, my focus and hopefully that’s what I’ll be remembered for.”\nAppointments to the Order of Canada\nGov. Gen.

The primary goal of this capital raise is to finance a portion of the company's pending acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply, a transaction valued at approximately $11 billion.\nThe offering, which is not contingent upon the completion of the acquisition, provides QXO with flexibility in capital allocation. This approach suggests that QXO's management is prepared for various scenarios, including potential regulatory challenges or alternative strategic opportunities.\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, prominent investment banks, are serving as underwriters for this offering. Their involvement is a testament to the institutional confidence in QXO's strategic direction. The transaction will be executed through multiple trading platforms, including the New York Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market.\nCurrent shareholders should prepare for a potential dilution of approximately 8-9% of their existing holdings as QXO is expected to issue around 35-40 million new shares, assuming the stock's market price remains steady. This dilution could initially pressure earnings per share and stock prices. However, successful integration of the Beacon acquisition could significantly enhance QXO's growth prospects.\nThis offering represents QXO's calculated shift towards equity financing amidst higher interest rates, aiming to maintain balance sheet flexibility. The move into the roofing supply sector may either represent vertical integration within construction materials or a strategic diversification into new markets.",

    "title": "\"Ajenos\" al INBA, \"bajada a los cuartos\", \"anti-sistema\" y el 18-O: Las tesis sobre cómo se originó la explosión",
    "text": "La explosión al interior de un baño del Internado Nacional Barros Arana (INBA) de la comuna de Santiago, que dejó a 35 estudiantes heridos y cinco de ellos en riesgo vital, abrió una nueva incógnita en torno a la tragedia: el origen del incidente se trató de una manifestación o no.\nDe acuerdo con los antecedentes que se manejan hasta ahora, la explosión se habría registrado en uno de los baños del recinto, presuntamente mientras un grupo de alumnos preparaba bombas molotov para luego lanzarlas contra Carabineros en la vía pública.\nLa persecutora Macarena Cañas , de la Fiscalía Metropolitana Centro Norte, detalló ayer \"el sitio del suceso era el interior de un baño en donde se produce por los vestigios esta explosión, y hay evidencia que pude advertir respecto de distintos elementos que son habituales de la confección de bombas molotov, pero como les digo, la información que nos puede brindar finalmente Labocar y Bomberos de Chile respecto de cómo se inició, hasta dónde alcanzó y otros elementos también son importantes en definitiva\".\nLa persecutora también sostuvo que se está indagando si los elementos que provocaron la explosión fueron ingresados por los estudiantes o si ya estaban dentro del establecimiento educacional. También se está verificando si los docentes estaban al tanto de estos hechos, algunos de los cuales no habrían informado a las autoridades por temor a represalias.\nComenzadas las diligencias investigativas del caso, diversas autoridades nacionales se refirieron esta jornada respecto de que si el hecho que originó la tragedia se trababa de una manifestación o no.\nEmilia Schneider (FA)\nPor un lado, la diputada Emilia Schneider (FA), quien preside la comisión de Educación de la Cámara de Diputados, señaló esta jornada en conversación con CNN Radio que \"con los antecedentes que tenemos, sería irresponsable de mi parte y de cualquiera atribuirle a algún sector político, algún sector ideológico, las manifestaciones del día de ayer\".\n\"Las y los estudiantes salieron el día de ayer a las calles por los cinco años del estallido social\", sostuvo. Señaló además que \"es inaceptable el manejo de explosivos, de elementos incendiarios, dentro de los establecimientos educacionales (...), porque expone no solamente a quienes se están manifestando, sino también a estudiantes que intentan ayudar a sus compañeros cuando se enfrentan a una situación como esta\".\n\"De los estudiantes que están lesionados, que se encuentran hoy día en centros de salud, no todos estaban participando de la manifestación\", complementó.\nMinistro Nicolás Cataldo Esta postura discrepa con la del ministro de Educación, Nicolás Cataldo . Durante el anuncio de serie de medidas tras la tragedia, el secretario de Estado condenó en un punto de prensa qu e \"las acciones de violencia, como las que hemos visto, no tienen ni pueden ser legitimadas como acciones de movilización social, porque detrás de esto no hay demandas, no hay objetivos, no hay rostros\".\nEl secretario de Estado planteó que \"una cosa es la movilización social legítima, en cualquier Estado de derecho, pero no podemos legitimar las acciones de violencia cuando estas son sin sentido, sin propósito, sin orientación y provocan además el daño que estamos evidenciando hoy por hoy\".\nConsultado ayer ante la posibilidad de que existan estudiantes involucrados externos al hecho que afectó en el INBA, el secretario de Estado sostuvo que \"sería muy lamentable evidentemente que hubiese interacción de un tercero ajeno al establecimiento educacional. Es parte de la investigación y evidentemente esperamos que esto concluya lo antes posible\".\nFue ayer que la ministra del Interior, Carolina Tohá , sostuvo que \"hay aquí una reflexión que hacer después de esto, ya que se ha hablado muchas veces de la gravedad de las bombas molotov, se ha hablado muchas veces que no es una herramienta de protesta válida ni aceptable\".\n\"Esperemos que esto que pasó ahora ayude a que nunca más ningún joven, ningún estudiante contemple como una posibilidad el uso de esta herramienta sea cual sea la protesta o la causa por la cual se quiera movilizar\", acotó.\nRodrigo Roco\nRodrigo Roco, director de Educación de Santiago, entregó diversas cifras en torno a la violencia escolar. \"En el período 2018-2019, entre cancelaciones de matrículas y expulsiones, como las sanciones más gravosas por faltas cometidas, no hay más de 10 casos\", dijo.\nEn ese sentido, sostuvo que \"en el período que va de mayo de 2022 a septiembre de 2024, tenemos más de 50 casos de sanciones gravosas\", agregó.\nTambién sostuvo que \"como municipio, hemos presentado entre 2022 y a la fecha al menos 17 querellas criminales por hechos de violencia de este tipo\".\nSobre el actuar, Roco dijo que \"no tienen que ver con demandas ni petitorios estudiantiles. Y quienes así lo han planteado, lo que han hecho finalmente es confundir a la opinión pública. Estos hechos de violencia no tienen un propósito. Son simplemente expresiones juveniles, expresiones de mirada anti-sistema\".\nComunidad educativa\nBaranny Figueroa , represente del Centro de Padre INBA, señaló que \"estamos muy coaccionados dentro del colegio como comunidad y siempre tratamos de actuar en bloque. Entonces la contención es generalizada hacia los padres y madres que están pasando por toda esta situación que es gravísima\".\nEl Presidente del Centro de Exalumnos y Exestudiantes INBA, Harold Alarcón , indicó que \"tal cual como en otros colegios ponen detectores de metales y tampoco existen detectores de bencina\".\n\"Si tú ves a un estudiante con una mochila que se sospecha de algo, tienes que citarlo a la rectoría, pedir que venga el apoderado y el apoderado le abre la mochila. No puedes abrir la mochila. Y así ocurren muchas cosas\", agregó.\nAlarcón explicó a La Tercera que la situación se dio durante la \"bajada a los cuartos\", que se trata de una tradición estudiantil en la que los alumnos mayores molestan a los más pequeños. Esto se daría generalmente durante el aniversario del colegio.",

    "text": "Brutally cold conditions in Kansas City did not stop the Chiefs as they defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-7 at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday.\nThe temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -20 degrees, making it the fourth coldest game in National Football League history, according to the Peacock broadcast.\nThe Kansas City offense hit the ground running, marching down the field on the opening drive and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown throw from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice would go on to finish the game with eight receptions for 130 yards.\nThe Chiefs never looked back, shutting down the Dolphins offense completely.\nChiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker went 4 for 4 on field goals and running back Isiah Pacheco ran it in for a three-yard rushing touchdown to put the game on ice (literally) in the fourth quarter.\nMahomes finished the game with 262 yards and a touchdown.\nTaylor Swift was in attendance and braved the frigid temperatures wearing a #87 Kelce jacket in support of her beau Travis Kelce. Kelce finished the game with seven receptions for 71 yards.\nPatrick Mahomes (15) and Isiah Pacheco (10) of the Kansas City Chiefs line up in the backfield during the second half against the Miami Dolphins on Saturday. – David Eulitt/Getty Images\nAt the end of the game, the temperature was -9 degrees and felt like -28 degrees, according to the broadcast.\nMahomes downplayed the cold weather, saying “It is what it is” when asked about it on the Peacock broadcast after the game.\n“We’re in Kansas City, at Arrowhead,” Mahomes said. “We are going to play in some games like this. So, our mentality was to come out here, play football and see what happens.”\nStill, Saturday’s conditions are rivaled by the coldest NFL game on record: the December 1967 “Ice Bowl” in Wisconsin, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys amid -13 air temperature and a -48 wind chill, according to the NFL.\nEarlier on Saturday, the Houston Texans defeated the Cleveland Browns 45-14.\nIt was a historic day for rookie Texans quarterback CJ Stroud, who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Stroud’s three touchdown passes tied a rookie record in a playoff game. The 23-year-old former second-overall pick also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history.\nThe NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the Green Bay Packers heading to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. Matthew Stafford will also make his grand return to the city where he started his NFL career when the Los Angeles Rams take on the Detroit Lions.\nOn Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers head to a snowy Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Philadelphia Eagles.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

However, we see that our constructiveness sometimes does not meet the same constructive approach in the behavior of our neighbors,” the Minister said. “We have been engaged in negotiations by facilitation of the European Union, among other facilitators, and nowadays we see that Azerbaijan, unfortunately, refuses to resume the negotiations in the existing frameworks. However, we are interested in continuing our negotiations. We attach importance not so much to the issue of who facilitates the negotiations, but to the principles, according to which the negotiations should continue. And in this context I would like to emphasize again that those are territorial integrity, recognition of legitimate borders, inviolability of borders, respect for each other’s sovereignty. These are the principles, according to which, I believe, peace should be agreed,” he added.",

    "text": "Una segunda persona, de la que no han trascendido detalles, ha sido detenida por el apuñalamiento mortal de un joven en A Coruña el pasado 24 de diciembre, han informado a EFE fuentes de la Delegación del Gobierno en Galicia. Esta segunda detención se une a la efectuada la pasada madrugada, cuando agentes de la Policía Nacional detuvieron a un joven coruñés de 21 años por su presunta relación con este caso. La madrugada del día de Nochebuena un joven de 22 años falleció por herida de arma blanca en el tórax tras una pelea en el cruce de las calles Juan Flórez y Sinfónica de Galicia. La Delegación del Gobierno en Galicia indica que se está trabajando en la identificación de otras personas implicadas en la pelea. Las investigaciones son secretas y de ellas se ocupa la Unidad de Delincuencia Organizada y Violenta (UDEV) de la Policía Nacional, que se encargó de investigar el crimen de Samuel Luiz, que recibió una paliza mortal en A Coruña el 3 de julio de 2021.
