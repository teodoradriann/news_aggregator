    "title": "Wine tourism emerges as an antidote to mass tourism challenges",
    "text": "2025-01-23\nWine tourism has emerged as an alternative that diversifies the tourist offering while addressing some of the challenges associated with mass tourism. As major cities face social tensions, sustainability issues, and increasing discomfort among residents due to uncontrolled influxes of visitors, this form of tourism provides an opportunity to redirect travelers' interests toward rural, natural, and more balanced destinations.\nThis tourism model, focused on visits to wineries, vineyards, and wine regions, offers a slower and more enriching experience centered on culture, gastronomy, and the local environment. Rural areas, traditionally less crowded and with limited economic development, are the primary beneficiaries of this activity. The positive impact of wine tourism is not only reflected in direct revenue for wineries and wine producers but also in the revitalization of local businesses, such as restaurants, rural accommodations, and complementary service providers.\nWine tourism helps redistribute visitor flows toward less crowded areas, reducing the concentration of tourists in cities already grappling with over-tourism, such as Paris, New York, London, Barcelona, Venice, and Amsterdam. By attracting tourists to wine regions, pressure on public services, housing, and urban infrastructure in large cities is alleviated, promoting better coexistence between residents and visitors. Additionally, this approach fosters a more genuine connection between tourists and the destinations they visit, encouraging a more conscious and respectful form of consumption.\nOne of the key aspects of wine tourism is its ability to promote sustainable development. Activities at wineries and vineyards are often aligned with environmentally responsible practices. Many wineries have adopted measures to reduce their carbon footprint, such as using renewable energy, managing water efficiently, and promoting organic farming. These initiatives not only enhance the appeal of wine tourism but also demonstrate that economic development and sustainability can go hand in hand.\nThis type of tourism also supports the preservation of cultural and natural heritage. Wine regions often boast a rich history tied to wine production, including traditional cultivation techniques, rural architecture, and a gastronomy closely linked to local products. Visitors' interest in learning about these traditions motivates local communities to preserve them, creating a virtuous cycle in which cultural identity becomes a key resource for tourism development.\nFrom an economic perspective, wine tourism is a significant source of income for rural communities. In countries where this type of tourism is being heavily promoted, such as France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, and the United States (particularly California), where wine is an iconic product, the activity generates both direct and indirect employment. Visits to wineries are typically accompanied by tastings, meals, and cultural events that stimulate the local economy and encourage entrepreneurship. This not only improves the quality of life in rural areas but also helps curb migration to urban centers, a problem that affects many agricultural regions.\nInternationally, wine tourism is becoming increasingly relevant within the tourism sector. Recent data shows a steady growth in interest in these types of experiences, particularly among high-income tourists and those seeking more personalized and exclusive activities. Wine fairs, festivals, and wine routes have become major attractions for travelers who wish to avoid overcrowded destinations.\nHowever, to maximize the benefits of this activity, proper planning and management of tourism resources are essential. Balancing the number of visitors with the environment's capacity to host them without causing negative impacts is crucial to ensuring long-term sustainability. Additionally, promoting this type of tourism must be inclusive, involving local communities in decision-making and ensuring that economic benefits are distributed fairly.\nWine tourism also has educational potential, raising visitors' awareness of the value of rural areas and the processes involved in wine production. This fosters greater respect for nature and culture, which is particularly important at a time when traditional tourism often prioritizes rapid and superficial consumption. By offering a slower and more reflective experience, wine tourism can transform how people engage with the destinations they visit.\nWine tourism presents a viable solution to channel mass tourism toward more sustainable alternatives, contributing to the economic and social development of rural regions. Its ability to redistribute tourism flows, preserve heritage, and encourage responsible practices makes it a fitting option for addressing the current challenges in the tourism sector.\nFounded in 2007, Vinetur® is a registered trademark of VGSC S.L. with a long history in the wine industry.\nVGSC, S.L. with VAT number B70255591 is a spanish company legally registered in the Commercial Register of the city of Santiago de Compostela, with registration number: Bulletin 181, Reference 356049 in Volume 13, Page 107, Section 6, Sheet 45028, Entry 2.\nEmail:\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nHeadquarters and offices located in Vilagarcia de Arousa, Spain.",

    "title": "Pi Network: el retraso en el lanzamiento podría impedir un aumento del 100% en el token",
    "text": "El token de Pi Network (PI) ha experimentado una subida meteórica, con un aumento del 830% en los últimos 30 días. Sin embargo, su precio actual está casi un 50% por debajo del máximo alcanzado en noviembre, cuando llegó a valer más de $80.\nCon esta caída, muchos traders consideran que el objetivo de $100 para el token es ahora poco realista. Este descenso no solo refleja el mercado bajista general, sino también problemas específicos de Pi Network, como los retrasos en el lanzamiento de su red principal (mainnet).\nDeclaraciones recientes indican que el lanzamiento de la mainnet probablemente será pospuesto nuevamente. Estos retrasos pueden impactar el precio del token, retrasando posibles aumentos de hasta un 100%.\n¿Un nuevo retraso en el lanzamiento?\nEl optimismo inicial estaba basado en que el token PI alcanzó casi $100 el 23 de noviembre, cuando llegó a un máximo de $88. Esto llevó a los inversores a creer que el token superaría los $100, desencadenando un fuerte movimiento alcista.\nSin embargo, este escenario no se materializó. El precio del PI cayó a $47 el 28 de noviembre y sufrió una caída brusca de casi el 90% el 5 de diciembre. Aunque el token se recuperó a niveles actuales, su valor es de $48.93 al cierre de este artículo, con una caída del 1,4% en las últimas 24 horas.\nEstos descensos están directamente relacionados con retrasos en el «período de carencia» previo al lanzamiento de la mainnet. El primer retraso fue de noviembre a diciembre, y uno nuevo en diciembre llevó a la caída significativa del 5 de diciembre.\nEn este último caso, el equipo de Pi Network pospuso nuevamente el período de verificación hasta el 31 de enero. Recientemente, indicaron que esperan lanzar la mainnet durante el primer trimestre del año, sin especificar el mes.\nRiesgos de nuevos retrasos\nLos desarrolladores argumentan que necesitan más tiempo para garantizar que al menos 10 millones de usuarios migren sus tokens a la mainnet. Sin embargo, existe un riesgo de que el lanzamiento vuelva a posponerse, algo que ha ocurrido repetidamente en los últimos años.\nAdemás, la plataforma requiere tener al menos 100 aplicaciones listas para la mainnet antes de su lanzamiento. Actualmente, hay cerca de 80 aplicaciones disponibles, por lo que necesitan al menos 20 más para cumplir este objetivo.\nUn camino incierto hacia los $100\nLos analistas eran optimistas sobre la posibilidad de que el token PI alcanzara los $100 con el lanzamiento de la red. Sin embargo, estas expectativas no se han cumplido, y el token ha mostrado un rendimiento negativo.\nLa consolidación del precio se ha producido ligeramente por debajo de la media móvil de 50 días y encima de una línea de tendencia ascendente trazada desde los mínimos de septiembre. Esta línea de tendencia actúa como soporte clave, aunque cualquier retraso adicional podría llevar el precio del PI a $43.10, su nivel más bajo desde diciembre.\nPor otro lado, si se confirma el lanzamiento de la mainnet, el precio del PI podría subir inicialmente a $68.80, seguido de una posible ruptura hacia los $100. Esta acción de precio sugeriría que la consolidación actual forma parte de un proceso de acumulación.",

    "text": "Former ADL boss Abe Foxman calls for scrapping DEI CHRIS MENEHAN DEI is treating Jews like white people. Time to shut it down. [pic.twitter.com/EXgxxm7aGj] — Echo Chamber (@echo_chamberz) [December 21, 2023] From [Jewish Insider, \"Former ADL, AJC leaders Abe Foxman and David Harris call for scrapping DEI\"](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/12/former-adl-ajc-leaders-abe-foxman-and-david-harris-call-for-scrapping-dei/): [Abe] Foxman, who served as the Anti-Defamation League’s national director for 28 years until 2015, insisted that DEI “cannot be fixed.” He said that part of the problem is that DEI is “based on a faulty premise — that racism is a function of oppressed and oppressors [and] that all white people are oppressors and all people of color [are] oppressed.” The results, Foxman said, are “bias, illiberalism, reinforced, legitimized and institutionalized antisemitism in many institutions.” Foxman added: “It has built a huge funded bureaucracy which is today difficult to change or amend. Efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed. It cannot be fixed, it needs to be scrapped and replaced by a vigorous implementation of our civil rights laws that are color blind, and apply equally to all. If necessary some civil rights laws can be amended and strengthened. DEI was developed to eliminate bias but sadly it created bias.” David Harris, the longtime CEO of the American Jewish Committee, echoed similar criticisms of DEI. “DEI has evolved into a mammoth, ideologically-driven presence on many campuses, some of which have literally hundreds of staff working exclusively in this space,” Harris told JI. “Accordingly, I don’t believe that outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims, so the goal of rethinking it conceptually is far more urgent than just trying to get along with it.” Current AJC and ADL leaders told JI their organizations are taking an engage-and-influence approach— and had been doing so well before Oct. 7. Sara Coodin, AJC’s director of academic affairs, said that the group “engages pretty regularly and partners with universities to work on education programs that can have the kinds of results we are looking for, more inclusion for Jewish students.” “We tend not to take an overly divisive approach when it comes to DEI,” she said, pointing to an AJC-run trip that brings DEI university staff to Israel. Current ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt also appears to be pivoting away from DEI. A few days ago, he hilariously claimed he's against \"cancel culture\" and described it as \"un-Jewish.\" Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL explains his role and relationship with Musk. “The only team I play for is the Jewish team” Goes on to say that cancel culture is “un-jewish”(lol), then celebrates Elon for banning “from the river to the sea.” [pic.twitter.com/xijsbwshFI] — Hark (@Hark240) [December 16, 2023] [Everything was great when the ADL was brainwashing children that whites are their oppressors](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=62856) but [now that Jews are being lumped in with whites it's suddenly a problem.](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64127) Read more at: [InformationLiberation.com](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64195)",
