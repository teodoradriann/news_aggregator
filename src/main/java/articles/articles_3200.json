    "text": "Nintendo has been squashing any attempt at Switch emulation over the course of the last 12 months. However, they haven’t stopped at emulation. Nintendo has now set their sites on Pirates. What’s more, they’ve resorted to some pretty impressive sleuthing to catch their first one.\nAs first reported on Game File and later IGN . Nintendo tracked down a key player in the emulation and modification scene. They did so by analysing his Reddit comments and searching their database for related names. Finally finding that he had requested repairs. That was all they needed to send him a letter telling him to cease and desist.\nBut what did he do? Reportedly, “Archbox” aka James Williams has been modifying consoles so that they can operate outside of Nintendo’s predefined rules. This extends to downloading a game cart’s content and security keys as well as emulating other consoles. James is also one of the moderators of Switch Pirates, a Reddit group that has grown to thousands of users.\nIf that doesn’t sound like enough of a slam dunk for Nintendo, James reportedly failed to show up to court and as such the court by default ruled in favour of Nintendo. This is not a good move for emulation as it only serves to reinforce Nintendo’s case that all forms of emulation should be considered illegal.\nIf you are interested in reading about how Nintendo considers linking to emulation software an act of piracy in and of itself read here . Nintendo also acquired a new domain recently, you might be surprised to find out which .",

    "text": "North Yorkshire, December 29: The mother of three children, Kirsty Bortoft, had planned a romantic evening with her partner, Stu, who discovered her &quot;lifeless&quot; on the couch several hours later. After forty minutes, doctors were able to resuscitate her, but in that time, Kirsty says she witnessed a number of things, according to The Metro. With her eyes wide open, she reported seeing &quot;strange&quot; patterns on her skin and unknown events. She now revealed her near-death encounter, piqueing everyone&#039;s interest in what she had seen during those 40 minutes. Scarborough, North Yorkshire, native Bortoft overcame a serious medical setback and survived against all odds, even though her chances of recovery were slim. According to the news site, she endured many cardiac arrest episodes and was placed into a medically induced coma. Bizarre Interview! Woman Claims She Spent 5 Years in Heaven While She Was Clinically Dead for 15 Minutes; Watch Viral Video. It was important to make a good recovery on the first night, she stated. Stu wasn&#039;t having any of it when it was suggested that he get ready in case I didn&#039;t make it, she added. My sister was contacted by my psychic friend to inquire about the situation, but at this time, nobody outside of my close family understood what was going on, Bortoft said. According to my friend, my spirit was in her front room, and I asked her to create lists for my dad and my boys. I told my friend that my body was breaking down and I didn&#039;t think I could get back into it, but she urged me to go back to into my body, she added what happened while she was unconscious. Ayahuasca, a Psychedelic Jungle Plant Will Give You ‘Near-Death’ Experiences. When Bortoft woke from her coma, she asked for Stu right away. Scans, performed just a few weeks after her near-death encounter, amazingly revealed absolutely no damage to her heart or lungs. When I eventually returned to my body, I remember having a sudden epiphany about what I needed to do to recover. I recognised that my duty here isn&#039;t over yet and that you don&#039;t die, only your body passes on, Bortoft said to The Metro. &quot;When the doctor questioned how I had repaired my lungs after I informed him, I told him my tale. I was thrilled and enthusiastic about my recuperation when I left&quot;, she stated. &nbsp;",

    "title": "Content creator Nick Trawick has local roots in Dothan",
    "text": "This Wiregrass has produced a few big names in the world from New York to Hollywood. However “celebrity status” has become more attainable for people to gain with the rise of social media. All it takes is one good video and you can launch a digital career. Well, the storyline is no different for Dothan native Nick Trawick. As a content creator his star rose bringing laughter to people through the screens from the user name @nicktrawick13. In the eleventh grade at the original Dothan High School, Trawick decided to fulfill his dream of performing in front of an audience. At a Black History month program he decided he wanted to be Michael Jackson and sing “Man in the Mirror\" in front of the entire school. It was a huge success. “I got bit by the bug,” said Trawick. “The performance bug is what I call it.” People are also reading… Then the next year, he decided to join the show choir and then he participated in his first talent show ever and won. Although he had a passion for performance he originally had dreams of going to school for dentistry and started out at Wallace Community College. But of course he changed his major at the last minute to theater. During his time in Dothan he performed with SEACT and always tried out for Hairspray, but never got the part that he wanted. He loved doing those shows beccause it was his favorite, musical. From his performances he was recruited by local dance studio PRJ to audition for their company and he was able to get his performance craving fulfilled through that outlet. “My entire life, I've always been my own biggest fan. It has kept me humble when I started to become more successful.” His journey on social media started in 2014/2015 and found success on DubSmash. The very first video that started his viral situation was when Blue Bell ice cream finally came back after a Listeria outbreak. Trawick created a super, mellow, dramatic, slow motion video running into Winn Dixie looking for the Blue Bell. “I think that was like the first video that I ever had go viral and I remember, have at least over a million views on Facebook at the time,” said Trawick. Nick shared he loves Facebook, always has, and always will love Facebook. He’s still very active on it today. Back in 2019 before Covid hit Nick transitioned from Alabama to California, to see a change in his day to day life. He never intended to start a social media career and actually had a friend encourage him to download TikTok. “I'm a theater boy, deep down I've always been. I'm a performer and I love the stage. I've I tried to do TV acting and things like that, but it doesn't fulfill me as enough. I'm a healer, I heal through comedy. That's why I do social media.” A major part of Trawick’s success and notoriety cam after the creation of his very popular character “Kleptora” which is a twist on Dora with kleptomania. In February of 2022 he pulled out the wig and already had the costume and started creating content. He had been trying his hand at Covid content creation for the past two years and built up a following on TikTok. His Kleptora character has raised his social following to 1.1 million on Instagram, 1.5 million on TikTok and 219 thousand on Facebook. The commitment to this character has even gone past the screen he even has a dog name Bootz, similar to Dora’s sidekick “Boots.” Nick doesn’t classify himself as an influencer, because he just wants to make art and put it out there and affect people and make them laugh. His goal is to take them out of the real world for a minute. “If you live for the the applause, you die by the boos,” stated Trawick. “Which means, if you're only doing what this type of stuff to get praise, then when they boo you, you're gonna fall. I don't do it to get praise from everyone. I do it to change or to make whoever needs to see it feel better.” Some advice he gave to anyone who is wanting to be a creator of some sort, in the Wiregrass area was to just put the content out there and just post your stuff, because you never know what could happen. “The hardest thing for me was literally being being secure in myself and being OK in my current situation, while still actively chasing my dream,” said the creator. He also believes once you realize you have free will, you can easily self-sabotage yourself in a heartbeat, but you have to just change your mindset and be OK with the things that you're presenting with yourself. He encourages others to be secure in the things that you're putting out and enjoy what you are doing and you're not enjoying it, you don't need to be doing it. “If you're trying to make content to make a living and to be rich. You're not gonna it's not gonna happen for you, because you're doing it for the wrong reason,” claims Nick.
