    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Lee County, Iowa from 1901-2000 was 28.2. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Lee County, Iowa experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Lee County, Iowa history.",

    "text": "Bishop to warn against moves to relax law on assisted dying\nShrewsbury's Catholic Bishop will use his Christmas homily to warn against efforts to relax the law on assisted dying.\nThe Rev Mark Davies will deliver the message at Midnight Mass, arguing against a \"deadly agenda\" he says it as odds with Christian moral inheritance.\nThe issue, which has sparked continuing debate in recent years, has been the subject of renewed public discussion in the past week after Dame Esther Rantzen said she had joined the assisted dying clinic, Dignitas, in Switzerland.\nThe Childline founder and broadcaster is currently undergoing treatment for stage four lung cancer.\nIn his homily Bishop Davies will say he believes it is wrong to use the Christmas period to lobby for changes in the law, and will argue that the concept of assisted dying sits at odds with Christian values.\nDame Esther had said her decision was driven in part by her wish that her family's \"last memories of me\" are not \"painful because if you watch someone you love having a bad death, that memory obliterates all the happy times\".\nBut addressing the Midnight Mass, Bishop Davies will say: “Truths we might too easily take for granted are recalled to every mind and heart by these festive days: the value of every human life; the innate dignity of every human being; compassion for the weakest; peace between men and the charity that we owe to each other.\n“These are values and moral imperatives which were alien and unthinkable to the ancient mind but which we trace back to the cradle of Christ’s dawning light.\n“Each generation passes through its own dark shadows to return constantly to his light. It seems especially sinister that the euthanasia lobby should choose this moment of the year to advance its deadly agenda and even use the Christian imperatives of “compassion” and “mercy” to speak of medical killing.\n“Christianity led us to care for the weakest and most vulnerable, euthanasia proposes a new morality where the light of Christ no longer guides us.”\nDame Esther's statement has led to activists and some politicians suggesting that the 1961 Suicide Act, under which assisted suicide may be punished by up to 14 years in jail, should be abolished or amended so doctors can assist in the suicides of some of their patients without fear of prosecution.\nShe had said that if she were to go ahead then it would put her family and friends at risk of prosecution because they would want to go with her.\nCabinet Ministers Michael Gove and Mel Stride have suggested that the law should be revisited by the House of Commons, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer indicated that he may permit parliamentary time for a so-called “assisted dying” Bill to be debated.\nSir Keir said personally be believed “there are grounds for changing the law”.",

    "text": "Detained American journalist Evan Gershkovich to stand trial in Russia\nRussian authorities\nconfirmed on Thursday that Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich will stand trial for criminal charges of espionage. The 32-year-old journalist was detained by Russian officials in March 2023 and accused of gathering state secrets. Russian officials have yet to publicly release evidence in support of their accusations and have extended Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention several times.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson in a February interview that Gershkovich might be returned in a prisoner exchange. Political analysts previously theorized Russia’s desire to use Gershkovich for bargaining leverage amid tension with the United States over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His case has been compared to the Soviet Union’s arrest of American journalist Nicholas Daniloff in 1986.\nWhat exactly has Gershkovich been accused of? Gershkovich collected secret information for the CIA about the production and repair of military equipment, the office of Russia’s Prosecutor General\nalleged. A trial date has not been released, but Gershkovich will be tried in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court over 800 miles east of Moscow.\nGershkovich will face a sham trial for a false and baseless charge, which is both deeply disappointing and outrageous, wrote Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker in a Thursday\nstatement. He has been wrongfully detained for 441 days for just being a journalist, she added.\nDig deeper:\nRead my report on Biden’s acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of Gershkovich’s arrest and the warning he gave Putin.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism,\nclick here.\nAn actual newsletter worth subscribing to instead of just a collection of links. —Adam\n[Sign up to receive The Sift email newsletter each weekday morning for the latest headlines from WORLD’s breaking news team.](/the-sift)",
