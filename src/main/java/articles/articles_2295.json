    "text": "In pictures: Belfast Zoo animals take in the first snow of the year Some were even out making snowballs! While they may not have to defrost their cars or worry about the heating bill, the residents of Belfast Zoo also are dealing with how to handle the cold weather. Belfast Zoo shared with us some snaps of their cold-loving animals making the most of the first snow on 2024 on Monday to cheer up this Blue Monday. A spokesperson for the zoo said: \"The animals of Belfast Zoo woke to a winter wonderland this morning. \"While many of the resident animals preferred to stay tucked up in their heated houses, some decided to have some fun in the elements. \"Species such as the penguins and red pandas naturally thrive in such conditions. \"However, others surprised their keepers with their willingness on getting out into the snow, such as the gorillas who took breakfast outside with silverback Gugas making snowballs for a treat.\" Check out the animals in the snow in our gallery below...

    "text": "The current Masonic government of the West is the antithesis of the 10 Commandments The current Masonic government of the West is the antithesis of the 10 Commandments. The West is currently being governed by anti Ten Commandments, not through any neglect but by systematic implementation, the horror of which is unimaginable and I believe has simply caused people to turn a blind eye to it, no matter how much it affects them and even to turn off so they don’t have to confront it. To be clear, anti Ten Commandments is by definition anti human. It is the Ten Commandments which make us human. There is no discussion on that. It’s a simple plainly visible fact. This has always been the position of Freemasonry. This is its position now. This is its position going foreward. This is the position of the antichrist and last but most consequential, this is the position of the program to microchip you. Let there be no doubt about that. It is damnation – forever- to hell- in a chip. There is no fish with these chips. You are the fish. The chips are for evil, not good. But let it not get so far that microchipping becomes feasible for them. Let us not let it get to that point which is over the edge of the cliff for mankind. Let not humans become demons in other words. If you stick to the Ten Commandments no matter what they can’t take that away from you. They can’t hijack your mind. They can’t enslave you, prepare you for microchipping, remove you from reality and enclose you in their cocoon of lies, illusion and inversion of life. It’s up to each individual. Do not become one of the victims mentioned in Apocalypse. Remember the Apocalypse was given so that it would not happen. If it was given as a fait accompli, the opposite to that, then it would have been issued by the devil, not God. This is not the case, clearly, otherwise what would be God’s purpose as He came to save, not condemn. Anyone can [join](/v3/login/new/). Anyone can contribute.

    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Cool weekend ahead, Arctic air settles in next week\nMYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - We continue to look ahead to next week with the Arctic stretch of weather arriving. Until then, expect a cooler forecast into the weekend.\nTODAY\nExpect a few more clouds around this morning with a cold start as you step out the door. Fair weather clouds will give way to sunny skies and an unseasonably cool afternoon.\nTemperatures should climb into the middle 50s today. Looking at the forecast as a whole, today is our second warmest day over the next ten days. Just to show the magnitude of the cold air expected next week.\nA breeze will develop with an approaching cold front this afternoon and continue into the evening hours.\nTHIS WEEKEND\nAnother shot of cold air drops behind the cold front, keeping Saturday nice and cold. Morning temperatures in the upper 20s will only climb into the low-mid 40s by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures will fall into the middle and upper 20s Saturday night.\nWe’ll warm back up into the lower 50s by Sunday afternoon with increasing clouds through the afternoon on Sunday.\nTHE NEXT WEATHER MAKER\nOur next cold front will deliver a round of quick-moving showers to start next week. Highs on Monday will be warm ahead of the cold front with temperatures in the lower 60s. We expect a breezy round of showers before the long stretch of colder weather settles in behind the system for next week.\nARCTIC AIR\nWe’ve been giving you the First Alert to the Arctic air next week for a while now.\nOur confidence in the cold temperatures is high. Temperatures will struggle, only reaching the upper 30s to lower 40s through next week. Overnight lows will fall into the low-mid 20s by the end of the week. Our normal temperatures for this time of year should be in the upper 50s for perspective.\nCopyright 2025 WMBF. All rights reserved.",
