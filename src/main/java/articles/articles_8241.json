    "text": "Commercial network operators in the USA such as AT&T and Verizon have fallen victim to Chinese cyber spies. The attackers, supported by the Chinese government, have gained access to customer phone records and data as well as private communication data of politicians and government officials. Even court-authorized wiretaps carried out by police authorities were intercepted. The FBI and the US cyber security agency CISA describe it as a \"comprehensive and significant cyber espionage campaign\".\nAnzeige In doing so, the FBI and CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) have confirmed what had previously become known. At the beginning of October, it was reported that AT&T, Verizon and Co. had allegedly been infiltrated by a Chinese espionage group . The campaign appears to be aimed at information gathering and is considered a potentially catastrophic security breach. This is because the cybercriminals could have had access to network infrastructures for several months or longer.\nTrump and his vice president targeted by spies The joint statement from the FBI and CISA does not provide details on the scope and duration of the cyberattack, but the attackers' connection to the People's Republic of China is mentioned several times. The investigation into the incidents is ongoing and affected victims are being informed. Names are not mentioned, but the cyber spies targeted Donald Trump, who has just been elected US President , and his Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, writes Politico .\nAccording to the report, the cyber spies had access to the phone data of several million Americans, but not every single person was monitored. The attackers were initially looking for around 40 victims to spy on. However, this number has now increased and could even include more than a thousand individuals, according to reports. In total, around 10 telecommunications companies were affected, including Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies.\nFailure in counterintelligence The cybercriminals responsible for the attack are called \"Salt Typhoon\", \"GhostEmperor\" or \"FamousSparrow\". In addition to gaining access to network infrastructures, the attackers also had access to other, more general Internet data. According to information from an entry in the Fraunhofer FKIE Malpedia database , a rootkit for Windows kernels called Demodex was used.\nAnzeige Observers describe this cyberattack on US network operators as a serious error in counterintelligence. After all, government agencies are also affected, so it can be assumed that sensitive data may also have been tapped.\nRead also US network operators apparently targeted by Chinese cybercriminals",

Miles de familias se verán obligadas a la pobreza y el desplazamiento si el Gobierno no revoca esta medida”.\nLea también: Gustavo Petro discutió con la Creg medidas para reducir tarifas de energía\nLos líderes comunitarios señalan que la Procuraduría había advertido sobre graves falencias legales en la resolución y que el Ministerio de Ambiente ignoró el 80% de las 1.350 observaciones presentadas por la comunidad.\nAdemás, insisten en que la delimitación del Páramo de Santurbán, ordenada por la Corte Constitucional desde 2017, aún no se ha finalizado, lo que hace inviable la declaratoria de una zona de reserva sin estudios concluyentes.\nAnte la falta de respuesta del Gobierno, las comunidades anunciaron que trasladarán las protestas a Bogotá y presentarán una serie de demandas, incluyendo una “tutelatón” masiva para exigir la revocatoria de la Resolución 0221.\nFinalmente, el gobernador de Santander viajará a la capital para solicitar una nueva intermediación del Ministerio de Ambiente y garantizar que las decisiones sobre el territorio sean concertadas con sus habitantes.",

    "title": "How Dry January can help with anti-aging, according to doctors",
    "text": "(NEW YORK) -- While Dry January -- giving up alcohol for the month of January -- has been shown to have benefits like better sleep and increased energy, giving up drinks could also help you live longer and look younger, research shows.\n\"Everyone will feel better [after] a month of alcohol-free. Everyone,\" said Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News chief medical correspondent and a board-certified physician in OB-GYN and obesity medicine, who has participated in Dry January for the past seven years.\nHere are three things to know about how replacing a cocktail with a non-alcoholic alternative, even for a month, can help you live longer, feel better and potentially make you look younger.\n1. Alcohol use is related to age-related diseases\nThere are a number of negative health effects of alcohol consumption, particularly when done in excess or binge drinking.\nBeyond the risk of accidents and injury when under the influence of alcohol, it is a risk factor for diseases including several cancers -- such as breast and gastrointestinal cancers -- liver disease, stroke, heart disease, and mood and memory problems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of which can lead to premature death and early aging.\n\"Alcohol's negative impact ripples across communities, affecting our bodies and minds, burdening our health care systems and leaving a trail of shattered lives,\" Dr. Michael Caldwell, chief medical officer of Dry January USA, the U.S. branch of Alcohol Change UK -- the charity that launched the Dry January movement a decade ago -- told ABC News.\nStudies do show some of these negative health effects can improve as alcohol consumption is reduced, which can help people live longer lives.\nA 2018 study published in the British Medical Journal found that among nearly 100 participants abstaining from alcohol for a month, and 50 who did not, moderate-heavy drinkers who abstained had improved health markers including lower insulin resistance, weight, blood pressure and certain cancer-related biological markers.\n2. Alcohol can worsen skin conditions\nAlcohol use is also related to skin health.\nA 2019 study of over 3,000 women ages 18 to 75 found that heavy alcohol use, defined as eight or more drinks per week, was associated with under-eye puffiness, increased upper facial lines, blood vessels and the loss of volume in the face.\nAlcohol is dehydrating, which can decrease the skin's elasticity and cause it to have a dry appearance.\nStudies have shown that alcohol use can also worsen skin conditions, including psoriasis, an inflammatory disease that visibly damages skin.\n3. Alcohol is linked to biological aging\nBeyond diseases and visible signs of aging, alcohol consumption is also associated with biological aging.\nA large 2022 study published in Nature analyzed nearly 250,000 biological samples in the United Kingdom and found that higher alcohol consumption resulted in shorter telomer length, a potential biological marker of aging that can contribute to more age-related diseases.\nWhile studies specifically looking at anti-aging effects of alcohol cessation are lacking, some evidence has shown negative health effects can be improved as alcohol use is reduced, which can help people live longer lives.\nAs mentioned previously, the 2018 study published in the British Medical Journal found that among nearly 100 participants abstaining from alcohol for a month, and 50 who did not, moderate-heavy drinkers who abstained had improved health markers including lower insulin resistance, weight, blood pressure and certain cancer-related biological markers.\nDoctors also say what is known about the negative health effects of alcohol use can be used to understand how cutting back could slow age-related diseases, visible signs of aging, and prevent people from mental health declines with age.\n\"Consumption dehydrates our skin and increases inflammation, which promotes premature aging,\" Caldwell said, adding that reducing alcohol intake may mean \"your mental health will improve, you will be more present with increased clarity of thought and you will have more meaningful relationships.\"\nHow to get started reducing alcohol use\nFor anyone deciding to participate in Dry January or looking to simply cut back on their alcohol consumption, Ashton recommends telling friends you're participating, which helps provide accountability.\nAshton also recommends marking successful days off on a calendar to track progress, and trying mocktails or other non-alcoholic beverages, especially if triggering social situations cannot be avoided.\nThere are also mobile apps, such as Try Dry, run by Alcohol Change UK, that can provide similar tracking and accountability reaching the Dry January goal.\n\"Even for a short period of time, you will gain much more than you realize by reducing and eliminating alcohol use from your life,\" Caldwell said.\nAshton warned that the Dry January movement is not meant to be a tool for people struggling with alcohol addiction.\n\"I can't emphasize this enough,\" she said. \"This is not for abstinence and sobriety reasons, but if you cut try to cut down and you are struggling, please seek professional help.\"\nIf you are concerned about yourself or a loved one, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMSA) confidential, free, 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

    "title": "Estrela Galán (Sumar) pide la condena del \"genocidio\" en Palestina para \"una Europa que apueste por la convivencia\"",
    "text": "Estrela Galán (Sumar) pide la condena del “genocidio” en Palestina para “una Europa que apueste por la convivencia” Estrella Galán, candidata de Sumar a las elecciones europeas, ha pedido este jueves a todas las fuerzas políticas presentes en el debate de RTVE su “condena” al “genocidio que se está cometiendo en Palestina”. Lo ha hecho en su primera intervención durante el cara a cara protagonizado por nueve formaciones políticas. “Necesitamos luchar por una Europa que apueste por la convivencia y por la paz, donde quepamos todos y todas”, ha dicho Galán, que ha insistido en esa misma idea en su segunda intervención, sin conseguir que los representantes de PSOE o PP utilizaran esos mismos términos para hablar de la masacre en Gaza. 23:12 h Irene Montero acusa a Jordi Cañas de querer hacerle un \"mansplaining\" y él le responde: \"¿Qué es un mansplaining?\" El debate de RTVE estaba abordando el segundo bloque, centrado en las políticas económicas de la UE, cuando la candidata de Podemos, Irene Montero, pedía “transformar el modelo económico liberal” para garantizar la igualdad de los ciudadanos“. ”No podemos afrontar la transición energética ni la emergencia climática si no transformamos el modelo económico neoliberal: hace falta que los fondos buitre no puedan comprar vivienda ni abrir nuevasmacrogranjas“, ha dicho. A renglón seguido tomaba la palabra el candidato de Ciudadanos, Jordi Cañas, que le reprochaba a Montero estar equivocada. “No me haga un 'mansplaining'”, le ha dicho la exministra al representante del partido que se dice liberal, en alusión al término que denuncia el machismo de los hombres que tratan de dar lecciones argumentales a las mujeres. “¿Qué es el 'mansplaining'?” se ha preguntado Cañas, aparentemente desconocedor del término. 23:09 h Diana Riba: \"Si volvemos a los recortes, no podremos hacer la transición verde\" La candidata de Ahora Repúblicas, Diana Riba, ha cuestionado que muchos de los partidos de los candidatos presentes en el debate votaron “las futuras políticas de austeridad” en el último pleno del Parlamento Europeo y ha exigido “seguir estas políticas expansivas, para llegar a estas transiciones ecológicas”. “Si volvemos a los recortes, no podremos hacer la transición verde. Si volvemos a los recortes, tendremos que cerrar escuelas, hospitales, infraestructuras...”, ha argumentado Riba, que ha dicho que “no nos va a quedar nada” para la transición ecológica si “vamos dando millones de euros a la industria armamentística”. 23:02 h Ribera (PSOE) acusa al PP de querer \"recortar\" la PAC y otras ayudas agrarias La vicepresidenta tercera del Gobierno y candidata del PSOE a las elecciones europeas, Teresa Ribera, ha acusado este jueves al PP y al resto de formaciones de derechas de querer recuperar una política de “recortes” en la UE en la legislatura que surja de las elecciones europeas de este domingo. “Ustedes y sus amigos quieren recortar las partidas presupuestarias y las más importantes son la PAC y las ayudas agrarias”, le ha dicho Ribera a Dolors Montserrat, la candidata del PP las europeas, haciendo también alusión a Vox y a otras formaciones con las que pactan los de Alberto Núñez Feijóo. 23:00 h Estrella Galán pide ser \"firmes\" para no bonificar a los grandes oligopolios La candidata de Sumar, Estrella Galán, ha defendido la descarbonización de la economía acompañada de una limitación del “control” de las grandes multinacionales eléctricas y energéticas que, según ha dicho, “tienen en su mano el control de los precios de la energía”. “Hay que desplegar una revolución energética”, ha dicho Galán, que ha pedido “ser firmes” para no bonificar a los grandes oligopolios. “Me consta que usted está por esa bonificación”, ha dicho dirigiéndose a la candidata socialista, Teresa Ribera, aunque luego ha añadido que “es un detalle” ante los gestos de Ribera, que no ha contestado. 22:54 h Montserrat (PP): \"Yo evité que los socialistas pusieran una etiqueta como la del tabaco en el vino\" Dolors Montserrat, candidata del PP a las elecciones europeas, ha acusado este jueves al PSOE de “dar la espalda al campo” durante la última legislatura en el Parlamento Europeo. Es más, la dirigente popular ha hecho mención a dos productos, el vino y el arroz, a los que según ella pretendieron perjudicar los socialistas españoles en la UE. “Yo evité que los socialistas pusieran una etiqueta como la del tabaco en el vino”, ha asegurado Montserrat, que ha pedido “luchar contra la competencia desleal”, así como “defender al campo” bajando el IVA a la carne y el pescado. 22:51 h Dolors Montserrat: \"El 80% de las iniciativas en el Parlamento Europeo son del PP\" La candidata del PP ha rebatido las acusaciones de Jorge Buxadé, de Vox, de que 'populares' y socialdemócratas votan “siempre” juntos asegurando que “el 80%” de las iniciativas presentadas en el Europarlamento parten de su partido y le ha exigido que diga la verdad y que “forman parte del gobierno de Europa con Úrsula Von der Leyen con un comisario de agricultura que es de Vox”. Montserrat también ha cargado contra el candidato de Ciudadanos, Jordi Cañas, diciéndole que “Europa también es la defensa del estado de derecho”. 22:47 h Irene Montero: \"Este país tiene que decir alto y claro 'no a la guerra'\" La candidata de Podemos a las elecciones europeas, la exministra Irene Montero, ha considerado este jueves, durante el debate a nueve de RTVE con motivo del 9J que una de las prioridades de los próximos meses tiene que ver con un compromiso antibelicista de la sociedad española tanto por la situación en Gaza como por la guerra en Ucrania. “Este país tiene que decir alto y claro 'no a la guerra' y votar por la paz”, ha insistido Montero en un breve rifirrafe con el candidato de Ciudadanos, Jordi Cañas, que se ha resistido a calificar de “genocidio” la masacre perpetrada por Israel en Gaza. 22:44 h El PNV pide un comisario que garantice \"el respeto\" a las lenguas cooficiales en la UE La representante de la coalición CEUS en el debate de RTVE, la portavoz del PNV Oihane Agirregoitia, ha pedido este jueves que en la próxima legislatura la Comisión Europea cuente con un comisario específico que “garantice el respeto” a las lenguas cooficiales de la Unión Europea, entre las que ha incluido al euskera, el catalán y el gallego. Agirregoitia ha coincidido con la representante de Ahora Repúblicas, Diana Riba, en reclamar la oficialidad de esas tres lenguas cooficiales en España. 22:41 h Ribera reprocha al PP que no reconozca a Palestina como Estado y Montserrat le responde acusándole de pactar con \"prófugos de la justicia\" La candidata del PSOE a las elecciones europeas, la vicepresidenta tercera del Gobierno, Teresa Ribera, ha reprochado este jueves, durante el debate de RTVE, a la candidata del PP, Dolors Montserrat, que su partido no haya apoyado el reconocimiento de Palestina aprobado por el Gobierno la semana pasada, pero la dirigente popular ha optado por obviar la cuestión y hablar de los pactos del Gobierno con formaciones independentistas. “Han entregado la igualdad de los españoles”, le ha reprochado Montserrat a Ribera, antes de acusarle de “negociar con un prófugo de la justicia que tiene vínculos con Putin”, en alusión al expresident catalán Carles Puigdemont. “Han entregado el código penal a los prófugos de la justicia”, ha zanjado. 22:38 h Irene Montero, a Teresa Ribera: \"¿Qué ata a este gobierno con el Estado genocida de Israel para no romper relaciones\" La candidata de Podemos al Parlamento Europeo, Irene Montero, ha asegurado que mucha gente se pregunta “para qué sirve Europa” si no es capaz de “construir paz y acabar con el genocidio en Gaza” y ha dicho que mucha gente se ha alegrado hoy “cuando ha creído que por fin el gobierno de España iba a llevar al Estado genocida de Israel ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia”, pero que dos minutos después esa alegría ha desaparecido. Dirigiéndose a la candidata socialista, Montero ha exigido a Teresa Ribera que explicase por qué España no ha roto relaciones “comerciales y diplomáticas con Israel” pese a haber retirado al embajador de Argentina y le ha pedido que reconozca que “lo que Israel está haciendo es genocidio”. 22:36 h Estrela Galán (Sumar) pide la condena del \"genocidio\" en Palestina para \"una Europa que apueste por la convivencia\" Estrella Galán, candidata de Sumar a las elecciones europeas, ha pedido este jueves a todas las fuerzas políticas presentes en el debate de RTVE su “condena” al “genocidio que se está cometiendo en Palestina”. Lo ha hecho en su primera intervención durante el cara a cara protagonizado por nueve formaciones políticas. “Necesitamos luchar por una Europa que apueste por la convivencia y por la paz, donde quepamos todos y todas”, ha dicho Galán, que ha insistido en esa misma idea en su segunda intervención, sin conseguir que los representantes de PSOE o PP utilizaran esos mismos términos para hablar de la masacre en Gaza. 22:25 h Diana Riba (Ahora Repúblicas) pide que catalán, euskera y gallego sean oficiales en la UE La representante de la coalición Ahora Repúblicas que engloba a ERC, EH Bildu y BNG ha pedido en su primera intervención del debate de RTVE que catalán, euskera y gallego sean oficiales en la Unión Europea. Para ella es “indispensable” que se reconozca esa oficialidad en la legislatura que comenzará tras las elecciones de este domingo. Además, Riba ha presentado su coalición como “la única candidatura que puede defender las naciones sin Estado y su cultura”, pero, además, ha querido lanzar un mensaje al conjunto de los votantes de izquierda. “Nuestra clase trabajadora nos tienen a nosotros para defenderlas”, ha dicho. 22:20 h Teresa Ribera: \"Hoy ya no me preguntan por Catalunya en la Unión Europea\" La candidata del PSOE, Teresa Ribera, ha afirmado que cuando fue nombrada ministra, en sus viajes a Bruselas le preguntaban por Catalunya “con gran desazón”, pero que hoy en día ya no le preguntan por ello. Lo ha hecho después de que la candidata del Partido Popular, Dolors Montserrat, haya acusado a los socialistas de “entregar la gobernabilidad a Puigdemont” y de que le haya exigido que “rectifique”. Montserrat ha acusado también a Teresa Ribera de “señalar” al juez que investiga a Puigdemont y al juez que investiga a Begoña Gómez y ha dicho que el PP va a seguir defendiendo el Estado de Derecho en la Unión Europea así como la igualdad de los españoles. 22:17 h Aleix Sarri (Junts) abre el debate de las europeas: \"Aquí tendría que estar Toni Comín, pero si hubiera venido estaría encarcelado\" El representante de Junts en el debate organizado por RTVE, Aleix Sarri, ha abierto este jueves el enfrentamiento con sus otros ocho oponentes haciendo una denuncia por la situación de los dirigentes independentistas que viven fuera de España. Además de reclamar “una Europa más federal”, Sarri ha recordado a Carles Puigdemont y a Toni Comín, el cabeza de lista de su formación a las europeas. “Yo no tendría que estar aquí”, ha dicho Sarri. “Tendría que ser Toni Comín, pero si hubiera estado aquí estaría encarcelado”, ha asegurado. La primera intervención del debate ha sido íntegramente en catalán. 20:41 h Comienzan a llegar los candidatos a los estudios de Prado del Rey para el último debate electoral Los candidatos de CEUS, Podemos, Junts+, Ahora Repúblicas o Sumar, Oihane Agirregoitia, Irene Montero, Aleix Sarri, Diana Riba y Estrella Galán ya han llegado a los estudios de Televisión Española cuando aún queda más de una hora para que de comienzo el debate electoral entre los nueve candidatos con representación en el Parlamento Europeo. Se espera que todos los candidatos lleguen a Prado del Rey, a las afueras de Madrid, antes de las 21.00 horas para que puedan preparar sus intervenciones antes de que de inicio el llamado “debate decisivo” en la televisión pública, a tres días de las elecciones. 20:36 h Sánchez equipara al PP con una matrioshka: \"Del PP sale Vox y de ahí el inframundo de Alvise\" Pedro Sánchez ha incorporado en su agenda de fin de campaña una parada en Catalunya junto a Salvador Illa, con el que ha compartido mitin este jueves en L’Hospitalet para volver a hacer un llamamiento al electorado progresista frente a la amenaza de la ultraderecha y de sus alianzas con el PP. “¿Sabéis lo que es una matrioshka? Esas muñecas rusas que se van abriendo y contienen otra dentro. Pues bien, los pactos de Feijóo con la ultraderecha han acabado por devorarle. Hasta el punto de que del PP de Feijóo sale el Vox de Abascal, y de Vox sale ahora el inframundo de Alvise. Los tres son la matrioshka de la internacional ultraderechista”, ha señalado. El líder de los socialistas ha resaltado que los populares “han pasado de decir que iban a arrasar con más de diez puntos a que su lema ahora sea que este partido lo van a empatar”. Y ha vuelto a reivindicar la honradez de su pareja tras las últimas maniobras del juez Peinado. “A mi no me duelen prendas decir que quiero a mi mujer y voy a defender su honorabilidad ante los ataques infames de aquellos que solo hacen oposición destructiva contra el adversario político”, ha dicho. Escribe José Monrosi 20:11 h Yolanda Díaz: \"Os pido que os movilicéis para mandar a Feijóo a casa el domingo\" La coordinadora general de Sumar y vicepresidenta segunda del Gobierno, Yolanda Díaz, ha pedido este jueves que las elecciones europeas del domingo se conviertan en un plebiscito contra el líder del PP. “El PP está nervioso porque sabe que la ciudadanía se está movilizando. Os pido que sigáis trabajando hasta el domingo para movilizar votos, para decirle a Feijóo que lo vamos a mandar a casa. Que no nos representan, que sus políticas son políticas fallidas”, ha dicho en un mitin en Málaga. “El próximo 9 de junio no van a ganar. La gente trabajadora va a salir a derrotar a Feijóo, va a salir a votar la gente LGTBI para decirles que no van a ganar. Os pido que este domingo vayáis a votar con el orgullo de un país diverso, que es plural, que es alegre, que no es como ellos, que quieren una España triste, que quieren retroceder 40 años atrás”, ha defendido la líder de Sumar. Escribe Alberto Ortiz 20:07 h El candidato de IU en la lista de Sumar a las europeas llama “trilero” a Albares y le pide “acciones concretas contra el genocidio” Aunque inicialmente el candidato de IU en la lista de Sumar a las elecciones europeas, Manu Pineda, había celebrado la decisión de España de sumarse al procedimiento contra Israel en la Corte Internacional de Justicia, más tarde se ha corregido en un tuit y ha calificado al ministro de Exteriores, José Manuel Albares, de “trilero”. “El trilero de Albares nos ha vuelto a engañar. España no se ha adherido a la demanda de Sudáfrica. No valen los eufemismos; queremos acciones concretas contra el genocidio. Ese es el único camino”, ha dicho en un tuit para pedir a España que “participe en las demandas contra Israel y sus altos cargos ”tanto en la Corte Penal Internacional como en el Tribunal Internacional de Justicia“. Albares había anunciado este jueves que España se sumará al procedimiento iniciado por Sudáfrica contra Israel en la Corte Internacional de Justicia por genocidio pero ha aclarado en su comparecencia que el movimiento no significa apoyar a ninguna de las partes sino asistir a los jueces a la hora de tomar una decisión. Por Alberto Ortiz 20:04 h La número tres del PP a las europeas, a Sánchez: \"A sus perros, como la vicepresidenta, no les va a quedar otra que temblarles el pulso\" Alma Ezcurra, número tres del PP a las elecciones europeas, ha pronunciado este jueves un durísimo discurso cargado de insultos y acusaciones contra el Gobierno “al que solo apoyan los terroristas, los talibanes, Hamás, los dictadores venezolanos o los amigos de Putin”. En un acto en el centro de Madrid, Ezcurra ha asegurado que los “fascistas” son “los socios” del Ejecutivo, “que tienen una asquerosa relación de intimidad con las dictaduras venezolana, rusa e iraní”. “Fascismo el de los independentistas, que los tenemos que ver en la calle vivitos y coleando”, ha añadido Dirigiéndose a Sánchez, la popular ha pronunciado la siguiente frase: “Al puto amo no le va a quedar otra más que claudicar y a sus perros, que es como se llaman, toda una vicepresidenta del Gobierno, no les va a quedar otra que temblarles el pulso. Les decimos que tiemblen, que tiemble la izquierda en este país”. Escribe Aitor Riveiro 16:49 h Manu Pineda (IU) pide una reflexión tras el 9J para volver a unir a la izquierda: “Nos une mucho más de lo que nos separa” El candidato de Izquierda Unida en las listas de Sumar al Parlamento Europeo, Manu Pineda, ha llamado este jueves a la reflexión a todas las fuerzas políticas para volver a ponerse de acuerdo después del 9 de junio, día de las elecciones. El eurodiputado ha dicho que no encuentra justificación para que Sumar y Podemos vayan en dos listas separadas y ha lamentado que se hayan roto “muchos puentes” en estos meses. “En Sumar apostamos por la unidad, somos una izquierda diversa que sabemos que estamos de acuerdo en lo principal y que tenemos diferencias pero somos capaces de hablar de nuestras diferencias y somos capaces de hacer síntesis”, ha dicho en el programa Carne Cruda. “Los compañeros han decidido hacer otra cosa. Lo respetamos pero consideramos que es un error”, ha dicho el dirigente de Izquierda Unida. “Cuando vas separado tienes que de forma exagerada, teatral, poner el acento en las diferencias en lugar de centrarnos en hacer política contra las derechas”, ha opinado después. Pineda ha llamado a la reflexión para el día después de las europeas. “Después del 9 viene el 10 de junio y la izquierda que hay es la que hay, no nos podemos inventar otra. Tenemos que volver a poner el acento, el foco, en que se visibilice lo que nos une, que es mucho más de lo que nos separa”, ha dicho para recordar que las derechas “hacen política con las derechas” y las izquierdas, “contra las izquierdas”. “Lo que tenemos enfrente es muy gordo”, ha reflexionado.

    "text": "The newly constructed Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya has recently implemented a ban on mobile phones within its premises. This decision, made by the temple trust and the Ayodhya administration, prioritises security and aims to create a more serene atmosphere for devotees visiting the holy site.“Yesterday, we informed the administration in a meeting. Looking at the security and devotees' facilities, the administration and the trust have made this decision. We appeal to all the devotees to respect this decision... We have complete facilities to keep mobile phones safe... We have the facility to keep any valuable item safely, the devotees are requested to avail these facilities and cooperate in maintaining the arrangements,” temple trustee Anil Mishra told news agency ANI. Temple authorities have urged devotees to respect the new regulation. Cloakroom facilities are available for safekeeping mobile phones and other belongings. Large crowds often gather at the Ram Temple, and mobile phones can pose security concerns in such settings. The ban aims to minimise the risk of potential misuse of devices for recording or transmitting sensitive information. This can contribute to a safer and more secure environment for all visitors.All About Ram Janmabhoomi TempleAyodhya's recently constructed Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is a majestic structure that blends tradition with grandeur. Built in the Nagara style, a quintessential North Indian architectural style, the temple stands tall on a sprawling 2.7-acre plot. As per reports, a 14-foot-wide security wall, called Parkota, will be constructed around the temple. Additionally, a multipurpose area will have six more temples, which would take the accommodation capacity of the premises to 25,000 pilgrims at a time.",

    "text": "From renewing your vows in front of Elvis to look-a-like competitions and then some of the best tribute acts this side of Memphis (whichever way that is), the [2024 Parkes Elvis Festival](/story/8473460/) has just about something for everyone. The festival brings thousands of people to Parkes and through the Central West, and is one of the [best and most unique events on the calendar. ](/whats-on/) From January 10 to January 14, the region will come alive to celebrate Elvis Presley and all things Rock 'n' Roll in what is [the festival's 31st year](/story/8038472/). There'll be hundreds of Elvis, Jailhouse Rock and Rock 'n' Roll themed events across five days. Here are the [details](/whats-on/): This year's theme is an Elvis classic: Get along to Parkes and be sure to wrap yourself in everything Elvis' musical drama, Jailhouse Rock. In the 1957 classic, The King of rock 'n' roll plays Vince Everett and is serving a one-year jail sentence for manslaughter. While in the big house, his cellmate, a former country singer, introduces him to the record business. As the movie goes, Everett takes to it so well that he decides to become a singer when he gets out. However, he is quickly disillusioned by the record business. Then, with the help of a new friend, he decides to form his own label, and soon becomes an overnight sensation. Jailhouse Rock is Elvis' third film that captures early Elvis in all his leg-quivering, nostril-flaring, lip-snarling teen idol glory. Being in January, and in Parkes, you can expect it to be very hot as you ???? The mercury is tipped to hit 30 degrees each day, and will peak at 34 degrees on the final two days of the festival, January 13 and 14. There is some rain on the radar as well. The wettest day looks to be day one. Weatherzone.com is forecasting around 5mm to fall, with a chance of rain each day of the festival.

    "title": "优化资源巧解停车难题",
    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n今年3月，上海市交通委员会表示，截至2024年底，上海市已累计创建215个停车资源优化项目，开工建设3.25万个公共停车位，提供4.44万个错峰共享停车位。2025年，上海计划持续推进创建30个停车资源优化项目，开工建设4500个公共停车位，建成20个示范性智慧公共停车场（库），基本实现智慧道路停车场建设全覆盖。这些数字的背后，是近年来上海市、区两级交通部门牵头破解停车难的不懈努力，多措并举让有限的空间资源承载住人民群众的美好生活。\n停车难的本质是城市公共资源供给与民生需求的结构性失衡，要破解这一困局，需通过重构物理空间，在空间利用上持续“做文章”。通过立体化、共享化、智慧化的空间再造，破解停车资源短缺的“硬约束”。位于上海徐汇的桂江路公共停车库，采用分层出让供地方式，地上为公园绿化，地下为公共停车库，实现了土地空间资源的复合利用，可有效缓解周边居民和商务办公的停车难题。类似桂江路智能停车库的新型智能停车技术的应用，是城市停车资源优化突破的重点。通过空间的复合节约利用、系统的高效精准运转，实现最大幅度的空间增容，让市民享受到安全、快速、便捷的停车体验。\n要想打好停车资源优化的城市“攻坚战”，还需激活时间资源。通过精细化治理将“时间差”转化为“资源差”，通过错峰共享、动态调配等方式，打破停车位在时间维度的闲置限制，实现存量资源的高效复用。这一模式不仅是技术层面的创新，更是城市治理思维从“静态管控”向“动态共享”转变的重要标志。位于上海普陀真如街道的曹杨八村，在普陀区交通委、曹杨新村街道办事处的协调下，向周边公共停车资源要效益。邻近该小区的真如山姆会员店提供了100个错峰共享停车位。利用停放需求的“时间差”实现错峰共享的“双盈利”，不仅缓解了停车供需矛盾，更推动了城市治理从“增量扩张”向“存量优化”的模式转型，为破解大城市停车难提供了可复制的解决方案。\n除了空间和时间上的变革，治理模式的持续升维也必不可少。通过制度重构、技术赋能和主体协同，实现城市治理从“管控”到“共治”、从“经验决策”到“数据驱动”、从“矛盾化解”到“价值创造”的跨越。要想推动城市停车资源持续优化，则需要构建多元共治体系，破解“碎片化治理”困局，通过整合政府、市场、社会等多方力量，突破传统单一主体治理的局限性，形成停车资源优化配置的协同网络，形成“政府主导—市场补充—社会协同”的良性生态。同时，通过技术应用推动停车治理不断升级，实现数据重塑管理效能边界，例如通过物联网传感器和AI巡检车实时采集车位状态数据，形成城市级“停车热力图”，提升城市停车资源管理的精细化水平和动态调控能力，进而实现从“被动响应”向“主动调控”的转型。\n搭建智慧停车场，通过科技智慧赋能优化市民的停车体验也不失为优化停车资源的有效之举。搭建智慧停车场，可以在市民的停车成本上做“减法”，通过自动化运营实现减负。上海市闵行区交通委对亭场路、平阳路沿线道路停车场实施了智慧化改造，可实现无人值守、自主缴付，并同步开通了错峰共享电子签约功能，停车人不仅可以进行停车自助缴费，还可实时查询道路停车的错峰共享服务信息，申请按月计费优惠政策。在完善使用体验方面，还可以设置蓝牙AOA定位基站、停车信息采集发布设备，提供面向车行和人行的路径规划、场内导航、空位引导、反向寻车等全过程智能引导服务，最终实现停车资源从“粗放供给”向“精准服务”的转变。（作者：唐一路 来源：经济日报）\n（责任编辑：符仲明）",

    "title": "Fallece testigo de Jehová tras negarse a recibir una transfusión de sangre, en Jauja",
    "text": "Un joven testigo de jehová de 19 años falleció en el hospital Domingo Olavegoya de Jauja (Junín), luego de permanecer cinco días en agonía, por negarse a recibir una transfusión de sangre tras sufrir una accidente de tránsito. La víctima s BRC sufrió un accidente este fin de semana al despistarse con su motocicleta cuando se dirigía por la carretera Central, distrito de Ataura. En ese momento optó por no prestar atención a sus lesiones y continuar su camino rumbo a su domicilio. Sin embargo, al día siguiente, los dolores abdominales se volvieron insoportables obligándolo a acudir al hospital. Los galenos detectaron que el paciente se desangraba internamente por una lesión en el hígado y bazo, por lo que decidieron someterlo urgentemente a una intervención para controlar la hemorragia. Rotunda negativa Mientras lo operaban, en los exteriores de la sala de operaciones los padres del paciente firmaban un documento rechazando expresamente la transfusión sanguínea por convicciones estrictamente religiosas. Al tomar de conocimiento sobre la insistente negativa de los familiares, la directora Nancy Baquerizo, solicitó la presencia de la PNP y el fiscal de turno quienes llegaron hasta la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos para explicarle que su vida corría peligro. Agonizando y con dificultades para hablar, su respuesta ante las autoridades fue que se respete su voluntad de no ser sometido a ninguna transfusión sanguínea. Los progenitores insistieron a los médicos aplicar métodos alternativos como el uso de eritropoyetina, que según ellos ayudaría a mejorar su hemoglobina. El joven, que se aferraba a la vida, siguió luchando pero al cabo de 5 días falleció.
