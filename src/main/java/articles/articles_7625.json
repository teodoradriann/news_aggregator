    "title": "Worst winter for 200 years saw Lancashire freeze as rivers and seas turned to ice",
    "text": "Just over 60 years ago, Britain experienced its worst winter in nearly 200 years. Known as the ‘Big Freeze’, the winter of 1962/63 saw some of the harshest conditions ever recorded, lasting up to 10 weeks.\nDown in Kent, the sea froze for nearly a mile, allowing children to play on its surface while ships sat on the ice. While the wintry outbreak began in December 1962, the snows started on Boxing Day with biting temperatures, hitting as low as -20C in some parts, lasting until March.\nThe Arctic conditions meant thousands of schools closed, telephone and power lines came down, and power cuts hit thousands of homes. Just before the New Year, a blizzard swept across South West England and Wales, causing snow drifts more than 20ft in places, driven by gale-force winds.\nRoads and railways were blocked while residents of remote villages were left stranded and without electricity. Even in Manchester city centre, the snow was six inches deep – even deeper in the suburbs.\nIn Rochdale, then part of Lancashire, Hollingworth Lake was frozen over for weeks, in places to depths of two feet. The first weekend in February saw people taking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk across the surface.\nEdge Hill College pond skaters. Taken from hall of residence, Lancashire Hall, near to Scarth Hill, Lancashire, in the severe winter of 1962/3\nAn account of the ‘Big Freeze’ written by The Guardian called ‘The Long Winter 1962-63’ claims the winter was responsible for at least 49 deaths. In Lancashire, two climbers were killed by an avalanche in the Chew Valley, near Oldham, and a man was reportedly found dead in a stranded car near Blackburn.\nNewspapers reported the severe frost had burst pipes in hundreds of homes in Lancashire while police smashed ice on canals and ponds, warning children to keep off the ice. The danger was real; eight years earlier, 21 Lancashire children drowned in ice accidents on one Saturday alone.\nSport during this terrible winter was also heavily disrupted. In the days before under-soil heating, frozen pitches saw football and rugby matches cancelled.\nFrom December 8 to February 16, Bolton Wanderers played no competitive matches. Burnley went 63 days without a league game, stretching from December 29, 1962, until March 2, 1963.\nDespite the chaos caused by the arctic conditions, there was still the opportunity for fun. Despite warnings, children and adults skated on frozen lakes and rivers. Giant snowmen were built while tobogganing became a national pastime while the snows endured.\nChildren on top of a giant snowball in Sefton Park, Liverpool (then part of Lancashire), during the Big Freeze of January 1963\nIn early March 1963, the ice began to thaw as temperatures rose, and by March 6, there were no frosts anywhere in the UK. Parts of the country that had just been in the iron grip of a bitter winter were now faced with floods as the ice and snow melted.\nDo you remember the ‘Big Freeze’ of 1963?

    "text": "From: National Defence\nNews release Today, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, welcomed Latvia’s Defence Minister, Andris Sprūds, to Canada\nMarch 7, 2024 – Ottawa, Ontario – National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces\nToday, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, welcomed Latvia’s Defence Minister, Andris Sprūds, to Canada. This is Minister Sprūds’ first visit to Canada since his appointment as Latvia’s Minister of Defence.\nMinister Blair and Minister Sprūds held a bilateral meeting at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa. The Ministers condemned Russia’s illegal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. Minister Blair commended Latvia’s military support to Ukraine and the Ministers reaffirmed that both Canada and Latvia will continue to provide Ukraine with comprehensive military assistance.\nTo further develop Ukraine’s drone capabilities, Minister Blair committed to Canada joining the Ukraine Defense Contact Group’s Drone Capability Coalition, co-led by Latvia and the United Kingdom. As a member of the Capability Coalition, Canada will continue to look for ways to boost Ukraine’s drone capabilities.\nTo date, Canada has stepped up significantly to contribute to Ukraine’s drone capabilities by donating over 100 made-in-Canada, specialized drone cameras to Ukraine from L3 Wescam. Building on these drone camera donations, Minister Blair announced an additional donation of over 800 drones from Teledyne FLIR last month in Waterloo, Ontario.\nThe Ministers also participated via video link in a videoconference on support for Ukraine, hosted by France’s Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Stéphane Séjourné, and France’s Minister for the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu.\nThe two Ministers discussed current efforts to scale up the multinational NATO Battle Group in Latvia, which Canada has led since 2017. Minister Blair thanked Minister Sprūds for Latvia’s hospitality to the approximately 1,000 Canadian troops currently deployed in Latvia.\nCanada is more than doubling its military presence on Operation REASSURANCE – from about 1,000 troops to a sustained deployment of up to 2,200 troops by 2026, as Canada committed in the July 2023 Roadmap on Scaling the eFP Latvia Battle Group to Brigade . Canada is also deploying additional capabilities to the Battle Group. In late 2023, Canada deployed a Canadian Army Tank Squadron of 15 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks to Latvia, and starting this summer, Canada will begin to deploy Royal Canadian Air Force helicopters to the Battle Group, as Minister Blair announced in December 2023.\nMinister Blair also highlighted that Canada is investing in new military capabilities for the Canada-led Battle Group. In 2023, Canada announced that it was designating three key capabilities for Canadian troops in Latvia as Urgent Operational Requirements. Since then, Canada has finalized the procurement of all three capabilities: anti-tank weapons ; an air defence capability; and anti-drone equipment . This equipment will begin to flow to Canadian Armed Forces members this year.\nMinister Blair and Minister Sprūds reaffirmed that Canada and Latvia are dedicated to maintaining a close, productive relationship as NATO Allies. The two Ministers agreed to stay in close, regular contact.\nQuick facts Canada enjoys excellent relations with Latvia. Canada was the first G7 country to recognize the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991, and one of the first countries to ratify Latvia's accession to NATO in 2004.\nLatvia is home to Canada’s largest current foreign military deployment. Approximately 1,000 Canadian Armed Forces members are deployed to Latvia.\nCanada is more than doubling its military presence in Latvia. Canada will complete the full implementation of persistently deployed Brigade capabilities to Latvia by 2026, at which point the Brigade will have up to 2,200 CAF members as part of the Forward Land Forces and supporting elements in Latvia.\nMinister Blair visited Latvia in December 2023, where he met with Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs and Defence Minister Andris Sprūds. During his visit, Minister Blair announced several measures to strengthen Canada’s military presence in Latvia, and several investments in infrastructure needed to scale up the current battle group to a brigade.\nMinister Blair and Minister Sprūds also recently met bilaterally and multilaterally in Brussels, Belgium at the meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in February 2024.\nCanada is participating in the Armour and Air Force Coalitions.\nAssociated links NATO’s military presence in the east of the Alliance Prime Minister increases support for key NATO presence Roadmap - Scaling the EFP Latvia Battle Group to Brigade Minister Blair announces measures to strengthen Canada’s military presence in Latvia Minister Blair meets with Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs and Defence Minister Andris Sprūds Canada acquiring air defence and anti-drone capabilities for Canadian Armed Forces members deployed with NATO in Latvia Canada-Latvia relations Canada and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Operation REASSURANCE Operation UNIFIER Contacts Diana Ebadi\nPress Secretary and Communications Advisor\nOffice of the Minister of National Defence\nEmail: Diana.Ebadi@forces.gc.ca\nMedia Relations\nDepartment of National Defence\nPhone: 613-904-3333\nEmail: mlo-blm@forces.gc.ca",

    "text": "Redding, CA [Black Bear Diner](https://blackbeardiner.com?utm_source=RestaurantNews.com), one of the fastest-growing restaurant franchises in the country, famous for its abundant portions of home-style comfort food, unique cabin-themed dining experience and exceptional guest service, announced it will be honoring Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day through an extension of its Bears Brew Back initiative. Bears Brew Back is Black Bear Diner’s long-term commitment to improve the lives of the people of Nicaragua. “Since 2017, our internal Black Bear Diner initiative Bears Brew Back has funded clean water and educational programs that have enriched the lives of women, men, and children in the Nicaraguan communities that grow our coffee,” said Anita Adams, Chief Executive Officer at Black Bear Diner. “This March, in addition to our own Bears Brew Back coffee which includes beans grown by women farmers, we are proud to support the Ladies To The Front initiative in partnership with our coffee roasters at Java City Coffee.” For the month of March, Black Bear Diner will feature Java City’s Ladies To The Front specialty coffee blend in its diners. This unique blend is sourced from women farmers in Jinotega, Nicaragua, part of the Tierra Madre group of Aldea Global. The blend meets high-quality standards and supports initiatives to secure land rights for these women, enabling them to access micro-credit loans for production and economic activities. The full circle initiative then extends to the United States, where the Nicaraguan beans arrive at Java City’s roasting facility in Sacramento, CA. Here, the coffee is exclusively roasted by female employees, completing the cycle that empowers women from growers to roasters and beyond. For every bag of Ladies To The Front sold, $1 contributes to a scholarship fund supporting the educational goals of women graduates participating in a coffee training re-entry program at Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center (RCCC) in Sacramento County. Bears Brew Back is an ongoing, long-term philanthropic partnership created in 2017 with Java City Coffee Roasters and the Global Aldea Foundation to identify humanitarian projects in Nicaraguan communities. Since its formation, Bears Brew Back has funded programs providing clean water to more than 350 homes and 10 area schools servicing more than 500 students annually. Funds have also helped to build a school lunchroom and kitchen as well as provide 5,000 school backpacks and supplies to area children.

Estamos hablando de cuatro millones y medio de australianos\", dijo Jim Chalmers, tesorero del gobierno. \"Es raro que un ciclón esté tan al sur y amenace una zona poblada tan amplia\", explicó.\nEstos fenómenos son habituales en las aguas tropicales del norte de Australia, pero mucho menos en las costas más frías del sur del país.\nDe hecho, la Oficina de Meteorología apuntó que Alfred será el primer ciclón en tocar tierra en la zona de Brisbane desde 1974.\nLos científicos han advertido repetidamente que el cambio climático amplifica el riesgo de desastres naturales como incendios, inundaciones o tormentas tropicales.\nbur-sft/djw/tym/dbh/ag",

The deadly floods in Ruidoso Tuesday took three lives and destroyed homes.\n“We've all seen the videos of the flooding and people's homes going down rivers, and that's really concerning,” said Jaime Aviles, one of three volunteers heading to the aftermath.\nThe record-setting floods raised the Ruidoso River 20 feet in thirty minutes.\n“It's always a sad situation whenever we get called out for a disaster. However, I'm looking forward to seeing how we can help these folks recover,” Aviles added.\nAviles says he is trained to assist families who lost their loved ones.\n“I'm sad that this is all happening,\" said volunteer Randy Ogden. \"There's a human life on the end of everything we do, and it takes a toll.\"\nOgden also mentioned that the Red Cross is seeing resources run out with back-to-back natural disasters.\n“Please consider giving blood. That's the one thing that all of us can do, and it only takes a couple of hours,” he urged.\nIn addition to giving blood, volunteers expressed the need for more volunteers and assistance. The Southern Arizona Chapter asks anyone looking to help to donate, volunteer, or start a fundraiser.\n——-\nReyna Preciado is a reporter for KGUN 9, she joined the KGUN 9 team in July of 2022 after graduating Arizona State University.

    "title": "Building Wealth With Norfolk Southern: Why I'm Buying More In 2024",
    "text": "Introduction\n2023 was a great year. Although I underperformed the S&P 500 due to my decision to stick to dividend (growth) stocks in a market that benefitted growth stocks, I was able to significantly increase some of my favorite investments, including Norfolk Southern (NYSE:\nNSC).\nYear-to-date, Norfolk Southern is the only railroad with a negative performance, including dividends. All other Class I railroads have performed better. Union Pacific (\nUNP), which is one of my largest holdings, came the closest to the 26.5% performance of the S&P 500.\nEssentially, there are two main reasons why Norfolk Southern is lagging behind its peers:\n- The company is an intermodal-focused railroad. In other words, it depends on consumer health and has less exposure to high-margin bulk shipments than most of its peers. Roughly a quarter of the company's revenues are generated in the intermodal segment, which services all major economic hubs in the Eastern part of the United States.\n- Earlier this year, it had to deal with a catastrophic derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which resulted in close to a billion dollars in additional expenses, a bad reputation, and high uncertainty regarding potential future costs.\nHowever, instead of panicking, I used weakness to add to my position.\nAs we can see below, my two bullish articles this year were written close to the bottom. My most recent\narticle was written on October 20, when I went with the bullish title \"I'm Buying Norfolk Southern Stock With Both Hands.\"\nSince then, NSC is up almost 18%, beating the S&P 500 by more than 400 basis points.\nThe reason I'm writing this article isn't to brag. After all, there's nothing to brag about. NSC's full-year performance is still poor.\nIn this article, I'm focusing on the risk/reward going into 2024. I'm using recent economic developments, the company's presentation at last month's Stephens Investment Conference, and very important developments in the intermodal industry, which could pave the road for above-average long-term growth.\nSo, let's get to it!\nTailwinds Despite Economic Headwinds\nBefore we discuss the good news, we have to briefly take another look at the bad news. Although I discussed the company's 3Q23 results in October, I'm taking a brief detour to remind everyone why NSC has been doing so poorly this year.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the company reported an 11% decline in revenues, primarily attributed to a significant reduction in fuel surcharge revenue.\nVolumes were down by 2%, translating to a $74 million revenue decline. Additionally, a reduction in intermodal storage revenue, amounting to $71 million, contributed to the overall decline in revenues.\nEven worse, the overall adjusted operating ratio for the third quarter was 69.1%, including a notable 270 basis points of headwind from net fuel price impacts.\nOperating income, on an adjusted basis, saw a decline of 28%, and net income and earnings per share were down by 37% and 35%, respectively.\nWith that in mind, roughly a month ago, the company presented at the Stephens Annual Investment Conference, NASH2023, where it discussed both headwinds and opportunities.\nOne of the most notable comments was that the railroad is experiencing a notable uptick in weekly volumes, reaching levels not seen in approximately 18 months.\nThis surge was attributed to improved service, positioning the company for increased business opportunities.\nLooking at the company's most recent weekly transportation numbers, we see that growth has returned.\nFor example, year-to-date, total carloads are still down 116,000 units.\nHowever, quarter-to-date, carloads are up 31,000 units, with strong growth in intermodal, which more than offsets declines in merchandise.\nGoing forward, the company expects growth opportunities in merchandise and intermodal markets, as it anticipates volume growth in these sectors, leveraging existing train capacities.\nThese markets were highlighted as areas with significant growth potential, supported by a robust plan for service improvement and productivity.\nFurthermore, the company observed elevated volumes in automotive shipments year-over-year, indicating strength in this sector.\nAdditionally, there is a robust demand in markets associated with non-residential construction.\nNonetheless, the decline in economic growth is also causing persistent headwinds, as the company noted ongoing weaknesses in certain markets, particularly in chemicals, domestic coal, and energy sectors.\nIn light of inflation challenges, the good news is that the company remains committed to a pricing strategy based on the value of its product, distinct from inflation-plus pricing or cost-plus pricing.\nDuring the Stephens conference, Norfolk noted the challenge of fully incorporating inflation into contracts due to the average duration of contracts being about 2.5 years.\nHowever, the company is confident in its ability to secure prices in excess of inflation over the long term.\nWith that said, the company also commented on a whole range of longer-term opportunities, which I want to discuss in the next part of this article.\nNorfolk's Long-Term Opportunities\nEarlier this month, I read an interesting\nhttps://www.freightwaves.com/news/can-intermodal-rail-increase-its-market-share-by-25-by-2030 on FreightWaves, which was titled \"Can Intermodal Rail Increase Its Market Share By 25% By 2030?\"\nAs Norfolk Southern is an intermodal heavyweight, this applies to the company.\nAccording to the report, the U.S. intermodal container traffic may be experiencing a downward trend in 2023, but a recent report from consulting firm Supply Chain Ecology, commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund (\"EDF\"), emphasized that intermodal rail remains a viable strategy for long-term growth in the North American freight rail industry.\nThe report puts forth five recommendations to enhance the role of intermodal rail. Here are the four biggest pieces of advice that apply to railroads like NSC:\n- Integration of Short-Line Railroads: Encourage collaboration between short-line railroads and Class I railroads through haulage agreements.\n- Development of Intermodal Hubs: Expand the network of intermodal hubs to facilitate rail-to-truck transfers, particularly utilizing short lines.\n- Advancements in Freight Technology: Embrace innovations such as autonomous rail cars and technologies for improved traffic management.\n- Freight Intelligence Tools: Develop tools enabling shippers to access data on service reliability and cost-related metrics.\nAs I discussed in prior articles, by implementing new growth measures, railroads can benefit from the fact that railroad transportation is much more efficient (and better for the environment) than trucking.\nGoing back to the Stephens conference, the company noted that it aims to regain market share from the trucking industry. The CEO, Mr. Alan Shaw, emphasized that rail has historically ceded share to trucks primarily due to service issues.\nThe company is addressing this by presenting a \"better way forward,\" focusing on investments in the cycle and committing to providing a consistently high-quality service product through various market conditions.\nEssentially, the company envisions a relatively quick conversion from truck to rail for certain customers, particularly in the merchandise and automotive businesses.\nThe key factor influencing this conversion is the ability to consistently provide high-quality service through economic cycles.\nNorfolk Southern is actively working with channel partners to expand its intermodal business, targeting a broader customer base beyond the existing ones.\nThe Atlanta-based railroad is also benefitting from another megatrend I often mention: supply chain re-shoring/near-shoring.\nNSC sees itself in a manufacturing supercycle driven by significant investments in new factories, particularly in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States.\nNotably, the EV market presents substantial growth opportunities, with $70 billion of EV investment announced in North America, $30 billion of which is on Norfolk Southern's lines.\nIf more companies move production to the U.S. or North America, in general, it requires transportation solutions. That's how straightforward it is.\nNow, it's up to the company to improve its services to attract new customers and close attractive long-term deals.\nRelated to this, as we can see in the screenshot above, Norfolk Southern is actively collaborating within the supply chain ecosystem.\nRecent\npartnerships with FEC and Canadian National ( CNI) demonstrate a commitment to working closely with other rails.\nStarting on October 2, Norfolk Southern will expand its existing portfolio to include FEC's Ft. Pierce and Ft. Lauderdale intermodal terminals. This complements current service to FEC terminals in Titusville and Miami. The result is added flexibility for Norfolk Southern and FEC's shared customers. It also expands direct access to and from markets in Chicago, Cincinnati, Harrisburg, Kansas City, Memphis, St. Louis, Lathrop, and Southern California.\nThe company also collaborates with over 260 short lines, focusing on first-mile and last-mile efficiency.\nThe goal is to provide a more efficient end-to-end solution that can effectively compete with trucking, aligning with the company's vision for success in the supply chain ecosystem.\nPlease note that these are also findings from the FreightWaves report I mentioned in this article.\nDividends & Buybacks\nOn top of working on long-term growth opportunities, NSC is a dividend growth stock with a great track record.\nCurrently yielding 2.3%, the railroad has a healthy payout ratio of less than 45%. Its five-year dividend CAGR is 12.2%. The company has hiked its dividend for seven consecutive years.\nDuring recessions, it tends to keep its dividend unchanged, which is fine with me, as I don't mind it when companies prefer balance sheet protection over achieving dividend aristocrat status.\nSince the early 2000s, the company has never cut its dividend.\nOn top of a safe dividend payout ratio, the dividend is also protected by a healthy balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of less than 3x EBITDA (despite recent growth challenges).\nThe railroad has a BBB+ credit rating, which is one step below the A range.\nThanks to a healthy balance sheet, the railroad is able to spend excess cash (after capital investments and dividends) on buybacks.\nOver the past ten years, NSC has bought back 27% of its shares.\nConsistent dividend growth and aggressive buybacks have allowed the company to beat the market on a prolonged basis.\nWith that said, let's take a closer look at the valuation.\nValuation\nBecause I bought NSC quite aggressively this year and its strong recent performance, it is now the 9th-largest holding of my 20-stock portfolio.\nNSC shares are currently up almost 30% from their 52-week lows, which has pushed the blended P/E ratio to 20.0x, as we can see in the overview below.\nFurthermore:\n- The company's multi-decade normalized valuation multiple is 17.2x. In recent years, it has traded closer to 18.5x, which is why I went with that as a \"normal\" valuation. It's displayed by the pink line in the chart below.\n- This year, EPS is expected to fall by 15%, followed by an expected recovery of 10% in 2024 and 12% growth in 2025.\n- Based on an 18.5x multiple and expected growth rates, the stock has a fair price target of roughly $268, which is roughly 14% above the current price.\nThis price target would imply a 9% annual total return through 2025, including its dividend.\nWith everything said so far, I'm looking to buy much more NSC stock in 2024, as I believe in its future plans and the potential of its increasing footprint in the North American rail industry.\nHowever, given its valuation and ongoing economic challenges, I prefer to wait for a 10-15% pullback in its stock price.\nAt that point, I believe the risk/reward is very attractive for long-term investors.\nMy rating remains Bullish, as I think this company remains in a great spot to beat the market on a long-term basis.\nTakeaway\nPositioned as an intermodal heavyweight, NSC stands out with a strategic focus on regaining market share from the trucking industry.\nThe commitment to offering consistently high-quality service, investments in the supply chain ecosystem, and collaborations with key partners like FEC and Canadian National highlight a forward-thinking approach.\nMeanwhile, the company's active role in reshaping supply chains, coupled with its pivotal role in the EV market, underscores NSC's significance in the evolving transportation landscape.\nWith a resilient dividend track record, strategic buybacks, and a good outlook, NSC is on my buy list for 2024.\nTest Drive iREIT© on Alpha For FREE (for 2 Weeks)\nJoin\niREIT on Alpha today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.
