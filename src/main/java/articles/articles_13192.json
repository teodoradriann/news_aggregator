    "title": "US' Firefly Aerospace Rocket Launches 8 Small Satellites For NASA",
    "text": "New Delhi, July 5 (IANS) American private aerospace firm Firefly Aerospace has successfully launched its Alpha Flight 5 (FLTA005) rocket, which carried eight CubeSat for NASA. The mission, part of NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative(CSLI), lifted off aboard the Alpha rocket, named \"Noise of Summer\" from Space Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9.04 p.m. PDT (9.34 a.m. IST). Following payload deployment, Firefly successfully performed a second stage relight and plane change manoeuvre to further test and validate Alpha's on-orbit capabilities, the company said. Firefly Aerospace is a NASA vendor for both launch and lunar services. \"The Firefly team knocked it out of the park,\" said Bill Weber, CEO of Firefly Aerospace, in a statement. Besides \"continuing this partnership,\" Weber aims to be part of NASA's \"larger space exploration goals from Earth to the Moon and beyond.\" The mission's CubeSats were selected through NASA's CSLI, which provides a low-cost way for universities, non-profits, science centres, and other researchers to conduct science and technology demonstrations in space. The CubeSats were designed by universities and NASA centres and cover science that includes climate studies, satellite technology development, and educational outreach to students. The launch \"demonstrates the capability of small rockets,\" said Hamilton Fernandez, mission manager for NASA's Launch Services Programme. Further, he added that via the CubeSat mission, NASA aims to \"build relationships with this new part of the US launch vehicle industry.\" Firefly is also in the final testing phase for its next Alpha launch, FLTA006. The team is concurrently ramping up for a responsive on-orbit Elytra mission that will launch on Alpha FLTA007 later this year while also working to complete the final readiness milestones for its first Blue Ghost mission to the Moon launching in Q4 2024, the company said.

Espot ha expressat una gran satisfacció perquè es faci realitat aquest projecte, que és tant ambiciós com necessari, diu, en termes de mobilitat i econòmics. La inversió de l'obra és de 26 milions d'euros i es reparteix a parts iguals entre els dos estats. Cal recordar que l'hivern passat, la via va estar tallada set dies. La construcció de la galeria és la inversió prioritària de l'acord internacional que van signar els governs d'Andorra i de França el març de 2017 i completarà en menys de dos anys el paquet de mesures engegades per prevenir i gestionar els riscos naturals al llarg de la frontera francoandorrana. L'H2 és un \"túnel\" de 300 metres que s'obrirà parcialment amb \"finestres\" al vessant aigües avall de la muntanya. S'autoritzarà el transport de materials perillosos i el trànsit de bicicletes, mentre que els vianants hauran de transitar pel camí que el voreja.",

    "text": "Depuis mardi, l'Espagne fait face à une météo fortement perturbée. À l'origine de cette agitation, un phénomène surnommé « DANA ». Suite à des pluies diluviennes, des inondations meurtrières ont frappé la région de Valence. Face à l'intensité de cette perturbation, y a-t-il un risque que la France soit aussi touchée ?\n« DANA » ou Depresion Aislada en Niveles Alto signifie en français « dépression isolée en haute altitude ». Il s'agit d'un phénomène climatique connu en France sous le nom de « goutte froide ». Depuis mardi 29 octobre, l'Espagne est balayée par ce phénomène, dont l'intensité est plus importante que d'habitude.\nPour cause, l'air froid en altitude a rencontré un air plus chaud et plus humide en basses altitudes. Résultat : la goutte froide a été boostée par les violents orages chargés en humidité en provenance de la Méditerranée. En seulement quelques heures, d'énormes quantités d'eau sont tombées sur la région de Valence.\nAvec plus de 300 mm de pluie, les cours d'eau ont vite débordé, plongeant la ville sous les eaux. Au total, ces inondations meurtrières ont fait plus de 70 morts et de nombreux disparus dans la seule région de Valence. Un bilan provisoire qui pourrait encore s'alourdir.\n« Dans des municipalités comme Turís et Utiel, environ 200 l/m² ont été enregistrés ce jour, mais de nombreuses localités ont enregistré plus de 100 l/m² aujourd'hui dans le sud et l'est de la péninsule », a indiqué l'Agence météorologique nationale (AEMET) sur son compte X. Au total, le service d'urgence de Valence a enregistré plus d'un demi-millier d'incidents en une seule journée.\n Météo France rassure Dans certaines régions de Valence, les services d'urgence ont même été contraints d'évacuer des bâtiments et des magasins à cause des inondations. Dans la région de Malaga, un train a même déraillé à cause des intempéries, touchants ainsi environ 291 passagers. L'ampleur des dégâts provoqués par cette goutte froide alimente les inquiétudes quant à une possible propagation de ce phénomène en France .\nTechniquement, l'Hexagone a déjà fait face à des phénomènes de « gouttes froides » similaires. Toutefois, le risque qu'ils soient boostés par des orages en forme de V, comme ce fut le cas en Espagne, est éloigné, rapporte TF1 . Selon Météo France, la goutte froide qui a touché Valence a déjà traversé la France et perdu, progressivement, son intensité.",

    "title": "Market Movers: 3 Unstoppable Stocks Set to Soar in 2024",
    "text": "We’re days away from the end of an incredible year on Wall Street. All the major indexes are up by double-digit percentages as we close out 2023. Notably, the S&P 500 runs 24% higher and the Nasdaq 100 is up an incredible 54%. It’s the complete opposite of what investors saw last year. Yet that’s the thing with [sharp market corrections](https://investorplace.com/2023/11/7-dividend-stocks-every-investor-should-own-to-survive-a-market-crash/). Bear markets are typically measured in months where bull markets that inevitably follow are measured in years. While no one knows for sure which way the market will go, the following unstoppable stocks for 2024 could just be market movers for your portfolio. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (NYSE: [PLTR](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pltr-stock-quote/)) was actually one stock to successfully capitalize on Big Data. They began to capitalize on the Big Data trend a few years ago, first for the government and later for the private sector. Big Data was the trend a few years ago that would reshape the future for business. It promised to transform trillions of bits of data into actionable information for companies. Although it didn’t quite work out that way, we’re seeing the same potential with artificial intelligence (AI), which is like Big Data on steroids. Consequently, the company is now using AI to go even further, launching its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to [speed workflows to customers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4646470-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript'). It now takes just days to analyze data when it used to take two to three months. As a result, customers are flocking to Palantir. Commercial customers grew 37% to 181, boosting revenue 23% higher year-over-year. Government sales jumped 12% in the same period. Unsurprisingly, it’s also profitable now for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis. As a result, analysts already see it as “the [best pure-play](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/the-next-nvda-3-ai-stocks-the-gurus-are-buying-hand-over-fist/) AI name.” There’s talk that the AI-rally might crash next year. Yet demand is still high and Palantir Technologies is the one to capitalize on it. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) When SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: [SOFI](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/sofi-stock-quote/)) went public in 2021, it brought with it a good deal of hype and hope. But it was primed to fall with a sky-high valuation, no profits, and a business model structured on several shaky pillars. And it fell hard. While the stock began trading at $20 a share and raced up to over $25, it has been on a long slide lower ever since. Shares fell to around $4 earlier this year. However, it is on its way back, now trading above $10 a stub. There’s good reason to believe 2024 could see the fintech stock soar. The Federal Reserve paused its aggressive rate hike policy and Chairman Jay Powell even hinted at possible rate cuts next year. Additionally, student loan [repayments have begun](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/why-sofi-stock-looks-like-excellent-value-heading-into-2024/) while loan originations soar. In fact, they doubled last quarter from the year-ago period to $919 million. Home loans were 64% higher. As a result, SoFi is putting together successive quarters of record sales and adjusted profitability. Its native digital platform helps users navigate a cradle-to-grave ecosystem. A borrower might take out a student loan first, turn to SoFi for a mortgage to buy a home afterward, and then tap one of its personal lines of credit to finance big-ticket purchases. With that said, SoFi Technologies is a riskier investment. Total household debt in the U.S. is at an [all-time high](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc) of $17.3 trillion as mortgage, credit card, and student loan debt piled higher. And a recession could topple SoFi’s stock again. And it doesn’t have much of a competitive moat. Still, macroeconomic indicators are moving in SoFi Technologies’ favor suggesting it it could make the next leg of growth a significant one higher. Tilray Brands (TLRY) While marijuana legalization is moving at a glacial pace in the U.S., the switch is gaining speed elsewhere around the world. That should boost Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: [TLRY](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tlry-stock-quote/)) potential because it has a global footprint ready to take advantage of the opportunities. Notably, Germany is [poised to legalize pot](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/3-small-cap-stocks-to-scoop-up-before-the-new-year/) early next year. Both Tilray’s international operations and its Aphria RX facility are located there. Ukraine just legalized marijuana, and U.K.-based [Prohibition Partners](https://hightimes.com/business/new-report-projects-global-recreational-cannabis-market-to-nearly-double-by-2027/) estimates the global marijuana market can hit $50 billion by 2027. Still, the U.S. remains the biggest market opportunity for the company. And Tilray won’t realize its full potential until that nut is cracked. It’s moving slowly, but President Biden just expanded the list of pot-related crimes individuals can be pardoned for. The impact is minimal, but it highlights the growing consensus legalization will happen sooner rather than later. Its shares are up 53% from the lows they hit earlier this year. However, they are still down 14% from where they started 2023. It trades at just a fraction of its book value making it a cheap stock with a lot of potential to soar in 2024.

    "text": "Union Minister Sitharaman shares PM Modi's note after meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial U nion Minister and BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday shared a note by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, written after his meditation session at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari. In his note, PM Modi wrote, \"It is my fortune that today, after so many years, as India embodies the values and ideals of Swami Vivekananda, I too have had the opportunity to meditate at this sacred place.\" \"My meditation at this 'Shila Smarak' is one of the unforgettable moments of my life. Sitting at the feet of 'Ma Bharati', I once again reaffirm my resolve that every moment of my life and every particle of my body will always be dedicated to the service of the nation,\" PM wrote in the note. \"With wishes for the progress of the nation and the welfare of its citizens, I offer my utmost reverence to 'Ma Bharati',\" PM Modi wrote. The Prime Minister was on a spiritual sojourn from May 30 evening to June 1 evening, for nearly 45 hours. He meditated through day and night at the same place where Swami Vivekananda did meditation, at the Dhyan Mandapam. He was meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam, where Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda is believed to have had a divine vision about 'Bharat Mata'. This coincides with the conclusion of polling for the final phase of Lok Sabha polls. Notably, Prime Minister Modi concluded his election campaign in Punjab's Hoshiarpur on Thursday, for the final phase of the general elections, which will be held on June 1. The Prime Minister held around 206 election campaign events, including rallies and roadshows, in 75 days. He also did around 80 interviews with different news and media platforms. The Prime Minister is known to undertake spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns. In 2019, he visited Kedarnath, and in 2014, he visited Shivaji's Pratapgarh. Today marks the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha election, which commenced on April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4. ✔️ Union Minister Sitharaman shares PM Modi's note after meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial 💕 Found this article helpful?

    "text": "Missing man, 71, found alive with dog by his side after disappearing for days GAFFNEY, S.C. ( [WHNS](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/04/18/missing-man-found-caught-barbed-wire-dog-stayed-by-his-side/)/Gray News) - Authorities in South Carolina say a man has been found with his dog by his side after going missing earlier this week. The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office said Billy Kearse, 71, required medical attention after being found Thursday afternoon but said he was located safely. Kearse had been missing since early Tuesday morning. Authorities said he went walking that day with his chihuahua to go fishing when he disappeared. Deputies stated that Kearse had a tracheotomy and uses a voice box amplifier, which added to his health concerns when he was first reported missing. On Thursday, people in the neighborhood were looking for Kearse when they found a fishing tackle box. They called law enforcement, who responded to search the area with canines and drones. Deputies said they found Kearse tangled in a barbed wire fence with his dog still by his side. The 71-year-old was severely dehydrated and airlifted to Spartanburg Regional Hospital. “We are grateful for the two citizens who were aware of the search efforts to locate the missing person and notified us after locating the fishing tackle box,” Cherokee County Sheriff Steve Mueller said. “Their efforts put us in the right location and subsequently officers were successful in locating him. Now we all pray for his recovery!” Copyright 2024 WHNS via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Windows recibe por fin la aplicación oficial de ChatGPT. Se diferencia de la versión para Mac en un aspecto clave",
    "text": "Los usuarios de PC hemos tenido que esperar alrededor de cinco meses para asistir al lanzamiento de ChatGPT para Windows . El cliente para Mac fue anunciado el pasado mes de mayo , pero no ha sido hasta esta semana de octubre que OpenAI ha lanzado una versión de escritorio de su popular chatbot para el sistema operativo de Microsoft. Ahora bien, los ordenadores con Windows seguirán estando un paso por detrás de los que equipan macOS. Es que la aplicación de ChatGPT para PC lanzada recientemente es una “versión preliminar” que no ofrece la experiencia completa. Además, está disponible únicamente para los usuarios de los pagos de pago ChatGPT Plus , Team, Enterprise y Edu. La principal ventaja de tener una aplicación de escritorio de ChatGPT es su integración con el sistema operativo. En Windows podremos pulsar Alt + Espacio para invocar al chatbot en una ventana independiente. Se trata de una ventaja que se superpone a todas las demás y que podemos ajustar a nuestro gusto. Podemos ocultarla también con Alt + Espacio. Tanto en la ventana principal como en la que abrimos con la combinación de teclas podemos subir archivos e imágenes para enriquecer nuestras conversaciones con ChatGPT. Esta versión también nos permite crear imágenes con DALL·E e incluso brinda acceso a la versión preliminar o1, el modelo de OpenAI que es capaz de “razonar” . Si nos enfocamos en las desventajas, ChatGPT para Windows se deja algunas características por el camino que sí están disponibles en macOS, como la posibilidad de usar la voz tanto para ingresar texto como para conversar con el chatbot. OpenAI dice que planea lanzar “la experiencia completa” para todos a finales de este año. Como señalamos arriba, otra de las limitaciones es que la aplicación de chatbot para PC solo está disponible para usuarios que pagan por una suscripción de ChatGPT. Esto no es diferente de lo que sucedió con el lanzamiento inicial para Mac, donde durante un tiempo también fue exclusiva de aquellos que pasaban por caja. Este lanzamiento tardío no pasa desapercibido si tenemos en cuenta que Windows no solo es el sistema operativo de escritorio más usado del mundo , sino que pertenece a Microsoft, una compañía que ha invertido más de 10.000 millones de dólares en OpenAI . En cualquier caso, la aplicación de ChatGPT se puede descargar desde la Microsoft Store .

    "text": "It caused havoc for aviation, with flights being cancelled across the countries.\nAir traffic restrictions saw major delays at Heathrow, with flight cancellations across the UK, including Manchester and Glasgow.\nThe UK's flag carrier British Airways cancelled 13 flights because of the weather. In Ireland, Dublin Airport remained unscathed, though Cork saw four diversions, to Dublin and Shannon.\nPlanes that managed to take off faced an equally difficult fate: trying to land in the storm.\nOne American Airlines flight was caught on camera during a particularly bumpy landing at Heathrow on December 27.\nThe Boeing 777, coming in from Los Angeles, was seen wobbling from side to side as it came down, toppling briefly towards the left, before appearing to bounce or \"bunny hop\" on the runway before sticking to terra firma and slowing down.\nThe \"insane\" landing was filmed by Big Jet TV owner Jerry Dyer, who regularly sets up livestreams at airports around the world to watch flights coming in, and has a particular soft spot for stormy weather.\nDyer told CNN in 2022 that he's drawn to the \"battle\" between man and nature during a storm at an airport.\n\"Whenever there's windy conditions, stormy conditions, I'm always up at Heathrow,\" he said at the time.\nThe most nerve-jangling airports for pilots in the world\n\"It's a lot more exciting to watch than aircraft just landing down and touching down and all that kind of stuff. It's the battle, isn't it? It's the forces of nature against an alloy tub with wings on it that we built and we have to control it down onto the ground in Mother Nature's winds.\n\"It's a fantastic thing to watch.\"\nHis\nlivestream of Storm Eunicein 2022, in which planes battled to land at Heathrow despite 122 mile-per-hour winds battering the UK, captivated the entire country.\nThere were more than 200 severe wind gust reports across Britain and Ireland on Wednesday, with a possible tornado sighting in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester.\nA level two of three threat for a severe storm remained for far south-eastern Ireland and west-central UK until early Thursday morning, according to the European Storm Forecast Experiment.\nStreaming the AA flight, Dyer's famously enthusiastic commentary noted the air \"vortex\" around the wings as it came in, before lamenting \"oh stop it, stop that\" as the plane bounced down the runway.\n\"How he did not go around I just have no idea,\" he commented.\nDespite the conditions, flight AA134, which had departed LA on December 26, touched down just one minute late – at 11.41am on December 27, according to flight tracker FlightRadar.\nIt then took off again about two hours later, making its way to Dallas, where it landed early. Luckily with a different crew.",
