[pic.twitter.com/6HOwo1YewM] — Chrystia Freeland (@cafreeland) [January 19, 2024] Canada has been a long- supporter of Ukraine as the country continues to fight off Russian aggression. Canada plans to allocate more than $940 billion in aid for Ukraine until 2026, according to the [2023 Fall Economic Statement](https://budget.canada.ca/fes-eea/2023/report-rapport/FES-EEA-2023-en.pdf). The Canadian government will send over $595 million to Ukraine in 2023-2024, $232 million in 2024-2025, and $143 million in 2025-2026. The statement by the Canadian Deputy prime minister came after a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Both parties discussed the implementation of mechanisms for using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. “During our meeting, Canada’s Deputy PM and Finance Minister @cafreeland and I focused on the use of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. This is a morally, politically, and legally right thing to do. Steps must be taken collectively and swiftly by the G7 and the EU,” Kuleba said on X.

[pic.twitter.com/beyMB5Ob02] — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) [January 18, 2024] At the end of April 2022, the US House of Representatives had approved a bill on the confiscation of frozen assets owned by Russian sanctioned entities and individuals. The seized funds had been proposed to be directed towards providing additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. In December 2023, the US proposed a plan to its G7 allies to confiscate $300 billion in Russian assets. In its turn, Russia denounced the freeze as a violation of the basic principles of reserve security, and hired international law firms, and commissioned expert views to defend its interests in [courts](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/01/12/bloomberg-russia-braces-for-legal-battle-over-its-frozen-assets/).

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

Taipei [Taiwan], August 23 : Taiwan detected 41 Chinese aircraft and seven Chinese vessels around its territory till 6am on Friday, Taiwan's Ministry of Defence stated. The defence ministry stated that 32 aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's Eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). Following this, Taipei monitored the situation and responded accordingly. \"41 PLA aircraft and 7 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today. 32 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern and eastern ADIZ.

The MND stated that three aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's Eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). In a post on X, the MND stated, \"8 PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8). 3 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern and eastern ADIZ.

China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island. Notably, Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary. So far this month, Taiwan has tracked over 300 PLA aircraft and around 200 Chinese ships. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of grey zone tactics by incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan.

Guadalupe Torres Sánchez consideró que San Luis Potosí debe sentirse privilegiado al ser incluido dentro de las primeras y principales obras de infraestructura que impulsará la virtual presidenta electa Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.\nTorres Sánchez refirió “esto coloca a San Luis Potosí en una situación distinta al resto del país porque generará más movilidad, nos coloca en una situación privilegiada en varios sentidos, como es el caso del turismo, desarrollo económico, en temas sociales incluso porque seguramente será un medio de transporte barato… nos sentimos afortunados de que así sea”.\n¿Regresará el tren de pasajeros a SLP?, te contamos sobre el proyecto\nEl segundo al mando de la administración estatal admitió desconocer mayores detalles sobre el proyecto, como es el caso de cuantas estaciones se ubicarían en territorio potosino, sin embargo, tan pronto se vaya a teniendo mayor información se irá compartiendo, pero dijo confiar en que sean varios puntos en donde haya estaciones de este nuevo tren en San Luis Potosí.\nDijo además que, esto tiene otros beneficios adicionales, puesto que sigue la misma ruta que la carretera 57 que actualmente está ya saturada, pues esto despresurizará en gran medida la movilidad de personas entre el norte y el centro del país, además de que se plantea que sea un tren eléctrico por tanto también habrá menor contaminación.\nFinalmente admitió que, tal como ha sucedido en otros casos como recientemente en el conflicto que hubo entre la empresa ferroviaria Canadian Pacific- Kansas City Southern (CP-KCSM) con colonos de las terceras en el norte de la capital potosina, el gobierno estatal intervendrá como mediador para llegar a acuerdos con comunidades, empresas o cualquier persona que en determinado momento pudiera sentirse afectada por la construcción de este nuevo medio de transporte.\nLee más: Claudia Sheinbaum presenta a Lázaro Cárdenas Batel como jefe de Oficina de Presidencia\n¿Cuándo comenzará la construcción del tren de pasajeros en SLP? De acuerdo a la propia Claudia Sheinbaum en una reciente comparecencia ante medios informativos, el tren México- Nuevo Laredo será el primer proyecto de infraestructura que estará impulsando, con la idea de incluso lanzar la licitación en cuanto tome posesión es decir en este mes de octubre de 2024.\n¿Cuál sería la inversión y cuánto tardará su construcción? Asimismo, la próxima presidenta detalló en su presentación que esta ruta de más de Mil 200 kilómetros que unirá el centro de México con la frontera norte, requerirá una inversión de unos 400 mil millones de pesos, la idea es que pueda operarse a través de una concesión con la propia (CP-KCSM) ya que correría por su mismo derecho de vía, además de que tendrá un tiempo de ejecución de aproximadamente cinco años.\nBuscarían incluir a San Luis en proyecto de tren de pasajeros México- Querétaro\n¿Qué municipios de SLP recorrerá el tren de pasajeros? Cabe destacar que, actualmente la vía férrea que forma parte de la ruta México-Laredo que cruza por la entidad potosina y que es utilizada para el transporte de carga por parte de (CP-KCS) atraviesa de sur a norte los municipios de Villa de Reyes, San Luis Potosí capital, Moctezuma, Venado, Charcas, Real de Catorce y Vanegas.",

    "title": "Régimen de Ortega sigue arremetiendo contra la Iglesia católica: tres sacerdotes detenidos en solo 24 horas",
    "text": "El sacerdote nicaragüense Fernando Calero fue detenido por la Policía, con lo que suman tres los curas encarcelados en las últimas 24 horas, denunció este viernes la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina.\n“Policía sandinista secuestra al sacerdote Fernando Calero, párroco de Nuestra Señora de Fátima (en el municipio de) Rancho Grande, (departamento de Matagalpa). Se desconoce su paradero”, señaló Molina, autora del estudio titulado ‘Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?’, a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).\nSegún la investigadora, Calero fue “secuestrado por la Policía Nacional en su parroquia” tras haber mencionado al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, quien preside la Diócesis de Matagalpa, en una misa.\n“No existe una acusación formal en contra de él y no se tiene información de su paradero”, explicó.\nCalero se suma a los sacerdotes Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente, que fueron detenidos el jueves por la Policía y civiles.\nLa semana pasada, las autoridades detuvieron al obispo Isidoro Mora, a dos sacerdotes y a dos seminaristas.\nNi el Gobierno ni la Policía Nacional han confirmado o negado la presunta detención de los religiosos.\nEl cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre esos arrestos.\nQuien sí lo hizo fue el exiliado obispo auxiliar de Managua, Silvio Báez, a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, quien se declaró indignado por los encarcelamientos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua.\nDos obispos, cinco sacerdotes y dos seminaristas presos\nEn el caso de Mora, obispo de la Diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, fue arrestado un día después de mencionar en una homilía al obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nMora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en una cadena nacional lo calificó de “soberbio”, “desquiciado” y “energúmeno”.\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.\nEl Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Álvarez.\nNicaragua atraviesa una crisis desde abril de 2018, que se ha acentuado tras las elecciones de noviembre de 2021, en las que Ortega fue reelegido para un quinto mandato, cuarto consecutivo y segundo junto a su esposa, Rosario Murillo, como vicepresidenta, con sus principales contendientes en prisión.\nEFE",

    "title": "Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists | Warrington Guardian",
    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
