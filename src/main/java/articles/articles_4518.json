    "text": "Walmart has the new Super Mario RPG remake for Nintendo Switch for only $47.74. This is the best price we've ever seen for a game that was just recently released (November 17) and better yet, it's a physical copy of the game. The game is sold and shipped by Direct Distributor via Walmart marketplace. I've personally purchased games from them in the past without any problems.\nSuper Mario RPG for $47.74\nSuper Mario RPG is a remake of the 1996 SNES classic. This was easily one of the best Mario games to grace the console back then, and Nintendo did a great job of staying faithful to the game's charm despite the upgrades. A whole slew of improvements have been implemented to bring this game up to modern day standards, including updated visuals, updated music, new gameplay mechanics, and a ton of quality-of-life UI improvements. Still, it's understandably difficult to pay $60 for a remake, so a deal is certainly welcome.\nWe didn't see any significant discount for Super Mario RPG during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you prefer a digital copy of the game, the eShop has a \" 2 for $100 \" video game voucher for Switch Online members. Super Mario RPG is an eligible game.",

From Velipoja in the north where the waves are swallowing a century-old forest, to the tourist hotspot of Golem where galloping construction of hotels and restaurants is accelerating erosion, the country's often spectacular Adriatic coast is under threat.\"Out of Albania's 273 kilometres (169 miles) of coastline some 154 are affected by erosion,\" urban planning specialist Besjana Shehu told AFP.Tourism in the Balkan nation is booming, from 5.1 million visitors in 2018 to 10.1 million in 2023. But new hotels, restaurants and beach bars are also taking their toll on nature.Rising sea level due to climate change is further complicating the situation. In Velipoja, a protected area close to the border with Montenegro, the sea is advancing more than five metres (16 feet) a year.It has already eaten 210 metres into the coastal forest, threatening an entire ecosystem that cannot live in salt water. Dozens of pine trunks lie strewn on the sand, many uprooted by violent storms late last month.\"Velipoja Park is shrinking,\" warned Agim Dardha, head of the protected areas agency for the Shkodra region. \"In the past 10 years alone it has lost more…\nAFP",

    "text": "Robin Hood rubava ai ricchi per dare ai poveri, Fleximan ruba vite . Non c’è nulla di eroico in quello che sta facendo il nuovo simbolo dell’egoismo in una società che , passo dopo passo, perde l’empatia e il rispetto per la vita altrui , anche e soprattutto quando entra in contatto con la nostra. Lo sterminatore di autovelox e il suo aiutante sono stati filmati a Rosolina incappucciati e l’auto con cui sono fuggiti aveva la targa oscurata. Penso ai ragazzi di Ultima Generazione , piaccia o non piaccia la loro protesta, che agiscono a volto scoperto e pagano in tribunale le conseguenze delle loro azioni. Autovelox, tutor, scout speed salvano vite. Il limite di 30 km/h nasce da studi scientifici dell’Organizzazione Mondiale per la Sanità. Statisticamente 9 pedoni su 10 investiti a 30 km/h si salvano; 7 su 10 a 40 km/h; 1,5 su 10 a 50 km/h. Il falso eroismo di Fleximan si basa sulle fake news. Una è che gli autovelox siano in mano ai Comuni per fare cassa . I proventi che derivano dalle multe per eccesso di velocità sono per legge (articolo 142, comma 12-ter del Codice della strada) «destinate interamente al miglioramento della sicurezza stradale attraverso interventi di manutenzione e messa in sicurezza delle infrastrutture». Se qualche sindaco le usa per altri scopi, va contro la legge . In quel caso va punito il sindaco e non lo strumento. Il 18 gennaio è stato divelto un autovelox a Riese Pio X, in provincia di Treviso . Qualsiasi motore di ricerca ci porta facilmente a vedere il passato di incidenti e morti sulla strada in quel piccolo paese. Lorenzo Borselli ha scritto con cognizione di causa su «Il centauro» , la rivista ufficiale dell’Asaps, portale della sicurezza stradale: «Ogni postazione fissa viene installata solo dopo il via libera del Prefetto, organo monocratico dello Stato, non di un comune… Se al Mit si ritiene che gli autovelox siano dispositivi truffaldini… ci aspettiamo: 1) un provvedimento che abolisca le multe per eccesso di velocità, dal momento che sono conseguenti alla commissione di truffe; 2) l’abolizione dei limiti di velocità; 3) una rivisitazione delle leggi della fisica, perché quelle che finora ci hanno insegnato devono essere tutte sbagliate; 4) l’immediata fine delle indagini per identificare Fleximan, che potrà comunque invocare di aver agito nell’adempimento di un dovere sociale. Robin Hood era un eroe, Fleximan è un «fake hero». Corriere della Sera è anche su Whatsapp .

    "title": "Boeing workers going on strike after 96% vote for walkout",
    "text": "SEATTLE — Boeing's US West Coast factory workers walked off the job early on Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with severe output delays and heavy debt. The first strike since 2008 comes as the planemaker is under heavy scrutiny from US regulators and customers after a door panel blew off a [737 MAX jet](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/377376) mid-air in January. The mounting crises hit Boeing's stock and sparked a leadership upheaval. The shares fell 2.8 percent in US pre-market trading on Friday, paring some earlier losses. The stock has lost nearly 38 percent so far this year, losing $58 billion in market value. READ MORE: [Boeing’s new CEO moves to factory heartland to stem safety crisis](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/590192) Shares in Spirit Aerosystems, the supplier Boeing is buying, fell 1 percent. New CEO [Kelly Ortberg](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/590192) was brought in just weeks ago to restore faith in the planemaker and proposed a deal including a pay rise of 25 percent over four years, far lower than the 40 percent workers had demanded. Roughly 30,000 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members who produce Boeing's top selling 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years, with 94.6 percent rejecting it and 96 percent favoring a strike in a two-part ballot. \"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result on Thursday evening. The union was going to get back to the table as quickly as it can, Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. Boeing said in a statement that it was ready to get back to the negotiating table, a sign that it was ready to sweeten the deal. \"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said in a statement. A long strike could badly hit Boeing's finances, which are already groaning due to a $60-billion debt pile. Boeing had said it had offered workers everything it could and needs to plan for the investments needed to replace its best-selling single-aisle models while placating striking workers with a better offer. Boeing's challenges The proposed deal included a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the contract term. Data from equity research firm Melius Research showed median employee compensation for the aerospace and defense firms companies it monitors grew 12 percent between 2018 and 2023. It fell 6 percent for Boeing and 19 percent for Spirit Aerosystems. \"The key question now is on the duration of the strike given the gap between the proposed wage increase and union members request,\" Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said in a note, adding that a long strike poses a key risk for 737 MAX production. Although IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers responded angrily, arguing for the original demand and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets. On Friday, members in the union hall cheered and chanted \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" and shortly after midnight, striking workers started to gather outside the entrances of Boeing factories in the Seattle area. Many waved placards that read: ‘On Strike Against Boeing', and drivers passing by honked their car horns in support. “I’m willing to strike for two months or even longer. Let’s go as long as it takes to get what we deserve,” said James Mann, a 26-year-old who works in a wings division at Boeing. The [Biden administration](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/587559) was in touch with both sides, White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said on Thursday. \"We are going to encourage both parties to negotiate in that way, in good faith and reaching a strong contract,\" she said. Strike! If prolonged, a strike would also weigh on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft. The Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for nearly two months and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day. According to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow. CFM, the sole-source engine supplier for the 737 MAX, said there was no immediate impact to its operations. READ MORE: [Boeing projects 3% hike in global airplane deliveries over next 20 years](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/588577) Air India CEO [Campbell Wilson](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/317578) said on Friday that Boeing's 737 MAX deliveries to his airline appeared to be \"delayed a little bit\" even before the strike announcement because of regulatory scrutiny after the Alaska Airlines door incident and [supply chain](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/584037) issues. Cathay Pacific and flydubai said they were in touch with Boeing. A flydubai spokesperson said the airline was looking forward to Boeing swiftly resolving the issue and it was talking to the aircraft maker regarding the delivery schedule. [S&P Global Ratings](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/583328) said that an extended strike could delay Boeing's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.",
