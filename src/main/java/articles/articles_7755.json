    "title": "Judge compares sex assault of woman with intellectual disability to molestation during man’s sentencing",
    "text": "CROWN POINT — A Lake Criminal Court judge compared a 62-year-old man's sexual assault on a woman with an intellectual disability to a child molesting during the man's sentencing hearing Thursday morning. \"He took a woman that had the mental capacity of a ten to 12 year old, groomed her and had sex with her,\" Judge Samuel Cappas said. \"She was not capable of understanding what was going on at the time.\" Danny L. Allen Sr., of Gary, pleaded guilty to sexual battery and criminal confinement for having sex with the woman whom he met through work at a Hobart restaurant. The woman was 19-years-old at the time, according to testimony from her mother, and had a low IQ. She was not fully aware of what was happening due to her disability, her mother said. Allen was sentenced to 7-and-a-half years in prison for the crimes, all suspended and to be served on sex offender probation. Both the prosecution and defense agreed on this term because of Allen's age and lack of criminal history. People are also reading… Deputy Prosecutor Jessica Arnold said if Allen makes a mistake while on probation, he will serve the remainder of the term in prison. Defense attorney Patrick Young said he doesn't believe Allen intended to harm the woman. \"The defendant now understands what he did was wrong and against the law,\" Young said. \"Now he understands?\" Cappas asked. Allen apologized to the woman and her mother in court for any pain he caused. \"I admit that I was wrong,\" he said. The victim's mother told the court her daughter met Allen on her first day of work in August 2020. She said she remembers going to pick her daughter up from work and seeing Allen with his arm around her shoulder. He introduced himself and told the woman's mother that if the woman ever was concerned about her daughter at work to call him. She said she remembered her daughter's bubbly personality changing over time—she became more withdrawn and would go straight to her room after work. \"She was no longer happy, no longer smiling,\" the woman's mother said. After the woman started crying more frequently, her mother probed further about what might have happened. The victim eventually disclosed that Allen had assaulted her but she didn't want to get him in trouble. \"Just because someone is 18 doesn't give [the defendant] the right to take advantage of anyone,\" the woman's mother said. \"Especially [someone] with special needs.\" The girl herself said she initially trusted Allen when they became friends, but then things took an uncomfortable turn. \"Danny would make me do things I didn't want to do ... when I would go home, I would try not to think about it.\" She told Cappas she remembers feeling intense anxiety throughout this time in her life. She said she is in therapy to work on healing and improving her self-esteem. She said Allen used to like her hair long, so she cut it short. \"I am learning to love myself again,\" she said.

    "title": "Full squad as Sarsfields seek culmination of 'fairytale'",
    "text": "Sarsfields manager Johnny Crowley expects to have a full squad to choose from for Sunday’s AIB All-Ireland Club SHC final.\nThe Riverstown club take on Dublin’s Na Fianna at Croke Park (1.30pm) as they seek to become the first Cork side since 2004 to lift the Tommy Moore Cup. Since losing the Co-op SuperStores Premier SHC final to Imokilly in October, Sars have beaten Feakle, Ballygunner and Slaughtneil and Crowley is optimistic that all of the panel will be available for selection. While there are a couple of niggles since last Friday’s challenge match against Tipperary, there are no major issues.\n“I think we’re okay,” he said, “we played a game on Friday night and Cathal McCarthy went over on his ankle, but he should be okay.\n“Aaron [Myers] got a few stitches, but that is all part and parcel of it.”\nThe recent bad weather has also affected preparations, but Sars have been able to come up with alternative plans when required.\n“We’ve had to adapt during the campaign and we had to adapt again last week,” Crowley said.\n“We had a match planned last Monday in the Mardyke against UCC and that went because of the weather. We had no pitch then, so we had to go to the all-weather. We were all-weather on Monday and Wednesday, as opposed to field sessions.\n“While I was very disappointed we couldn't get onto the field as this is the big week really for hurling, we couldn't get what we wanted to, I think we got a lot of value out of the all-weather, as well, you know.\n“They are not going to get any fitter and they are not going to get any fatter at the moment. They are what they are. It is probably just sharpening up a small bit.”\nCrowley’s return as manager for 2023 was driven by the late Teddy McCarthy, who had become vice-chairperson of the club.\nGoing all the way would honour the memory of the Sars, Glanmire and Cork legend as well as those of others who have passed on, while the club had to deal with their pitch being flooded in October 2023.\n“It is almost like the perfect fairytale end,” Crowley said.\n“Not to be going back, everybody knows and it is well documented, the damage that was done. It literally devastated the whole place.\n“Then on top of it, it is just incredible that you had three huge characters within the club, Ger Mulally, Teddy Mac, and Conor McCarthy, their passings really hit the club hard because they were three young men, three hugely important Sars people in different aspects.\n“Ger was treasurer of the juvenile club and doing a hell of a job. Conor was so involved in training young fellas around the place. Then Teddy was Teddy. With the disruption and these huge losses within the club, we just kept going and we kept finding and finding and finding a way.\n“At no stage did we ever, ever see ourselves playing in an All-Ireland club final. As a young lad, you will always have ambitions of, I can play in a county final because you've seen county finals.\n“I remember 1989 with my dad, God rest his soul. We played with the Glen. You are a young lad and you are saying, ‘I could possibly play in a county final some day if I applied myself right.’\n“But to think that you'd play in an All-Ireland club final, it would never come into your mindset, so if we could it would be the icing on the cake.\n“But look, we have a huge, huge task ahead of us. Hopefully.”",

    "title": "Geopolitical strife, world trade slowdown pose risks to Indian economy: RBI",
    "text": "Spillover effects from the slowdown in world trade, tighter monetary conditions, increasing fragmentation and geopolitical strife remain contingent risks to the Indian economy, the Reserve Bank of India said on Thursday.\nIn its biannual ‘Financial Stability Report’, the RBI noted that the impact of El Niño conditions could present a challenge to agricultural output and food prices.\nMeanwhile, Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal said the Red Sea crisis has hit India’s exports of rice, while the impact on other sectors would be known once the monthly trade data is made available.\nGeopolitical strife in the Middle East have escalated to tensions in the Red Sea region. Indian shipments to the Middle East, US and Europe have been affected.\n“Red Sea disruption is a matter of fact,” Goyal told reporters at an event. “One industry that we know that has been affected is rice... But we will know all the details once we have the data for the current month,” he added.\nGlobal headwinds pose the main risks to the outlook for the Indian economy, although macroeconomic stability is anchored by moderating inflation, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a modest current account deficit (CAD), the RBI said.\nIt also noted that the Indian banks are well capitalised and capable of absorbing macroeconomic shocks, that net non-performing assets (NPA) ratio of banks declined to a multi-year low of 0.8 per cent at the end of September 2023.\n“Macro stress tests for credit risk showed that SCBs (scheduled commercial banks) have sufficient capital buffers and even under adverse stress scenarios their capital ratios will remain above the regulatory minimum,” the RBI said.\nThe RBI highlighted the continued improvement in external vulnerability indicators. Foreign exchange reserves of $616 billion as on December 15, 2023, are sufficient to cover about ten months of actual imports for 2022-23. External debt moderated to 18.6 per cent of GDP in June 2023; and the share of short-term debt in total external debt declined to 19.6 per cent in June 2023, the RBI said.\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank remains alert and committed to act early and decisively to prevent any build-up of risks. “The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain invested in preserving financial stability and fostering a financial system that is resilient to shocks and supportive of growth,” Das noted in foreword to the report.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:02 IST)",

    "text": "Interrupting Vice President Kamala Harris during a San Jose appearance made Maimona Afzal Berta’s voice shake and her body tremble, but she felt compelled to stand up and speak out.\n“Madame Vice President, we demand a ceasefire now,” Berta yelled out in the middle of the packed theater at Mexican Heritage Plaza on Monday afternoon, right as Harris was beginning a talk about reproductive rights.\nBerta held a Palestinian flag over her head, and continued to call out for a ceasefire in the deadly Israel-Hamas war. She was quickly ushered out of the theater by security guards and Secret Service agents, while members of the audience clapped, chanted over her or echoed her statement.\nJust hours later,\nBerta took her seat at the wooden dais of the Santa Clara County Office of Education, where she is the board president.\nA few seats down from her was Raeena Lari, another board member, who was also standing in protest with Berta at the theater Monday, holding up a handmade, dark red cloth sign that read, “ceasefire now.”\nBerta and Lari’s action during Harris’ talk marked one of\nseveral protests from audience members calling for a ceasefire and for an end to U.S. military aid to Israel, which temporarily halted discussion during the second stop of the vice president’s “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour.\nHere’s video of\n[@SCCOE]board president Maimona Afzal Berta, and board member Raeena Lari being escorted out of [@VP]Kamala Harris’ event while making their protest. Near the end of the clip is [@CityofGilroy]Councilmember Rebeca Armendariz also calling for a ceasefire.

Gilroy Councilmember Rebeca Armendariz also interrupted the event, along with her mother.\nBerta and Lari accounted for two of five Santa Clara County Office of Education board members who voted in favor later that night of adopting a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.\n“I know our students and youth, including my children, are watching my actions,” Berta told San José Spotlight. “What’s happening in Gaza right now has a direct impact on our children here because they are witnessing all of this violence unfold right before our eyes. And not enough adults are saying this is wrong, and we want the killing to stop.”\nAs an educator, mother and a board member who has faced crowds of people unhappy with her decision making, Berta said she didn’t make her decision to interrupt Harris lightly, and noted it followed other attempts to get messages to the nation’s leaders.\nBerta and Lari signed and helped circulate a community letter last fall in support of safety, health care, water, food and education for all children in Gaza, and sent it to White House officials. They also met with Congressmembers Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren to push them to call for a ceasefire.\nLari said she believes Harris’ discussion of reproductive rights is an important topic, but as a board member working on behalf of children locally, she felt she must speak against the violence in Gaza, which has been called a “graveyard for children”’ by\nthe leader of the UN.\n“I wish that we didn’t have to do it,” Lari told San José Spotlight about her protest. “But it feels like there is no end to what is happening there. Things are getting worse by the hour it seems. I think history will not judge us well if we don’t speak out at this point.”\nBerta noted\nreporting from Jezebel that miscarriages have increased by 300% in Gaza. Lari pointed to an NPR report on UN statistics that women and children are the main victims of the war so far, with “an estimated two mothers losing their lives every hour.”\nHarris noted during the talk that everyone has a right to have their voice heard. She said everyone wants the conflict to end as soon as possible, and that she and President Biden are working on it every day, but added that she was at the theater to focus on reproductive freedoms.\nJohn Pelissero, a senior scholar at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said elected officials have an obligation to model good citizen behavior.\n“One way to look at that is you get to protest, as citizens get to protest. On the other hand, if you’re an elected official, while you might not agree with all the policies of the Biden administration, shouldn’t you demonstrate that you will respect and tolerate what the speaker has to say?” Pelissero told San José Spotlight. “If you’re an elected official and you’re giving a speech, don’t you want those in the audience to allow you to give that speech?”\nPelissero noted that students will see the actions taken by board members and said it’s important to demonstrate how to protest effectively and fairly.\nHe said elected officials in general should consider the venue and method of their protest actions carefully.\n“I’m not sure the public would always see it as a good and fair or respectful engagement in protest if you are doing it to interrupt another elected official,” he said.\nSome members of the audience on Monday also said, despite the violence in Gaza, they felt the interruptions distracted from the important message of reproductive freedoms and justice that Harris was championing.\nBerta sees it differently.\n“There is no reproductive justice during genocide. Those two can’t coexist and so it would be hypocritical of me to attend the event and pretend that over 10,000 children have not been killed, when that’s having a direct impact here locally,” she said.\nContact Joseph Geha at\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or @josephgeha16 on Twitter.",
