    "text": "They’re the ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things and change the world for the better. Top line Over 2023, we’ve seen incredible individuals who deserve recognition. Buzz.ie today looks back on some of the everyday heroes of the last year. Andy Howard hitchhiked all the way to Australia in aid of suicide prevention charities. The 28-year-old from Dunlavin, Co [Wicklow](https://www.buzz.ie/all-about/wicklow), completed the trek to show “even when odds are against you, you can find a way”. He set off around the world with no money, the clothes on his back, and a rucksack on January 14 and arrived Down Under in May. Andy, who lost his close pal Louis Caplis to suicide in 2018, said he hopes his project named Seeking Human Kind – would smash stigmas associated with mental health and help those suffering to come forward.

Australia is a good distance but I was thinking how can I make this harder and I said ‘Right if I start off with zero money’ that’ll make it even more difficult. I am relying on human kindness to show even when odds are against you, you can find a way.” He is now embarking on a new challenge where he will drive a road-legal drift car from Australia to Ireland. All funds raised will go to the Make a Wish foundation. Micheline Walsh faced homelessness at 78, along with her seriously ill husband. She bravely revealed her battle in May, speaking out about the impact of getting served with an eviction notice, She highlighted the issue of older people in rental accommodation in the housing crisis. Micheline told how she faced a move to a city centre hostel, even though she was nearing 80. In an article in the Irish Times, she said: “Every morning, when I wake, the reality of our predicament descends on me and I am afraid. I grit my teeth and set about reducing everything around me to the bare minimum, so we are ready to meet this oncoming train.” The nation was gripped by the torment of Thomas Hand, originally from Dun Laoghaire in Dublin - the father of Hamas hostage Emily. He was told his daughter had been killed when Hamas militants invaded Israel on October 7. Thomas said “death was a blessing” for his daughter Emily rather than being held captive in Gaza. A distraught Thomas, who lived in an Israeli kibbutz close to the Gaza border, said: “She was either dead or in Gaza. And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. “They’d have no food. They’d have no water. She’d be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people. Terrified every minute, hour, day, and possible years to come. So death was a blessing.” A number of weeks went by and it emerged that Emily had not died and instead been taken hostage. Thomas travelled to Dublin, London, and New York and did countless interviews to keep Emily in people’s minds.. Emily was eventually released under a brief truce agreement between Hamas and Israel on November 26. She had been held hostage for 50 days. On November 23, three children and a creche worker were brutally stabbed in Dublin city. The creche worker - Leanne Flynn Keogh - heroically protected the three young kids in her care. Warren Donohoe, Alan Loren-Guille and Caio Benicio also all jumped into action when they came upon the incident on Dublin’s Parnell Square East. Brazilian delivery driver Caio Benicio said that he did not have “time to be afraid” when he bravely jumped in. A GoFundMe appeal to buy him a pint saw him gifted nearly €370,000 for his actions.

    "text": "OTTAWA — The $18.4 million CBC/Radio-Canada awarded in bonuses to its employees this year is shocking, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said.\nHe also said bonuses at the public broadcaster aren't justified because a government-owned corporation doesn't face competition like in the private sector.\n\"The juicy bonuses given under the pretext that without them we aren't competitive in the market — well, we've been hearing that for decades .... Negotiate yourself a salary,\" Blanchet told reporters in the lobby of the House of Commons.\nDescribing bonuses as icing on a cake, Blanchet suggested the corporation was using them as a \"kind of backdoor salary\" that hides how much people are really being paid because the bonuses are only revealed in the media \"once a year.\"\n\"There can be a little bit of icing, but when the icing becomes part of the salary, I usually start to question things,\" Blanchet said, adding that the millions of dollars in bonuses \"shocks\" him.\nThe Canadian Press reported this week that the public broadcaster paid $18.4 million in bonuses to 1,194 employees this year after it eliminated hundreds of jobs. That included $3.3 million paid to 45 executives, which comes out to an average bonus of more than $73,000.\nMore than $10.4 million was paid out to 631 managers, and over $4.6 million was paid to 518 other employees.\nThis year's amount is an increase from the $14.9 million paid out to 1,143 employees in the 2022-23 fiscal year.\nOpposition Conservatives want the head of the public broadcaster, Catherine Tait, to return to the parliamentary hot seat and provide answers. Earlier this year, members of the House heritage committee unanimously concluded in a report presented to the House of Commons that, given the budget cuts, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to award bonuses to its executives.\nIt is not clear whether Tait was among those who received performance pay this year. The CEO's performance pay is determined based on a recommendation from the CBC/Radio-Canada board of directors, with approval from the federal government.\nThe CBC and the federal government have both refused to answer questions, citing privacy rules.\nBetween December 2023 and March 31, CBC/Radio-Canada laid off 141 employees and cut 205 vacant positions.\nNDP heritage critic Niki Ashton said, \"it is time to prohibit the CBC from giving bonuses to executives, and for it to use that money to save local journalism.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.\nÉmilie Bergeron, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "IBM cuts jobs in US while adding roles in India • The Register",
    "text": "Following our report last week on IBM's ongoing layoffs, current and former employees got in touch to confirm what many suspected: The US cuts run deeper than reported, and the jobs are heading to India.\nIBM's own careers site numbers back that up. On January 7, 2024, Big Blue listed just 173 open positions in India. On November 23, 2024, there were 2,946 jobs available in the nation. At the time of writing, the IT titan listed 3,866 roles in India.\nAmerican jobs listed for these three periods are 192, 376, and 333, respectively, though at least among those being laid off, there's doubt those roles will be filled with job seekers in the States.\nA current IBMer who won't be there much longer said that after being told to teach recently hired workers in India \"everything I know,\" the reward was a resource action, or RA – Big Blue's euphemism for a layoff.\nAfter receiving an RA notification, employees typically have a set period of time to apply for open roles elsewhere in the mega-corporation. But just because there are open positions listed in the US doesn't mean IBM is making much of an effort to fill them, we are told.\n\"Everyone I asked internally for 'transfer' all said the same thing … 'I can only hire in India,'\" our source said, echoing sentiments expressed by numerous other former employees who have spoken previously to The Register .\nEveryone I asked internally for 'transfer' all said the same thing … 'I can only hire in India'\nShifting jobs to India appears to be a theme at IBM, which we referred to as Indian Business Machines back in 2017 in a report about the tech giant's enthusiasm for offshoring.\n\"In Q4 [2024], there were widespread layoffs rumored to be in the thousands, yet over a thousand job openings were created in India,\" a former IBMer told us in a recent interview. \"The favoritism was blatant.\n\"Many of those laid off had extensive cloud experience, only to be back-filled with individuals who had little to none. The most concerning shift was the complete outsourcing of QA [quality assurance] to India.\"\n\"This resulted in near-daily escalations, as they attempted to replace highly experienced Quality Engineers – some with over a decade of expertise – with new hires trained in just six months. The consequences were predictable: a massive decline in quality and efficiency.\"\nWe're told that the focus on India-based workers extended beyond hiring practices. Our source described participating in an internal project that required the inclusion of team members from India, regardless of their interest in participating in the endeavor.\n\"Meetings were moved to accommodate their time zones, completely disregarding what worked for local teams,\" we're told. \"I stayed up late several nights with just one other colleague, and together, we built a working product – only to watch it fail due to the forced inclusion of individuals who didn’t contribute.\n\"At this point, IBM might as well move its headquarters to India since it no longer prioritizes the US. The company has made it clear where its focus lies – at the expense of experienced employees, quality work, and overall performance.\"\nAt this point, IBM might as well move its headquarters to India since it no longer prioritizes the US\nThe IBMer who spoke with us last week about the Cloud Classic layoffs also said jobs have been moving to India. \"In January, they pretty much doubled the headcount for a lot of teams with personnel from India,\" this individual said.\nThe outgoing IBM staffer told us that those layoffs extended beyond Cloud Classic to other groups, a claim supported by recent reports of job cuts in North Carolina. There is word of layoffs in Canada, too, this week.\n\"Management keeps pushing to look for opportunities for growth and future clients, [but] nothing is really showing promise,\" this individual said.\nIBM did not respond to a request for comment.\nDell sheds ten percent of staff for the second year in a row It looks like IBM is cutting jobs again, with Classic Cloud hit hard AWS sued by product manager who says she was laid off for being an older woman Microsoft walking away from datacenter leases (probably) isn't a sign the AI bubble is bursting In February 2024, an IBM spokesperson told The Register , \"In 4Q [2023] earnings last month, IBM disclosed a workforce rebalancing charge that would represent a very low single digit percentage of IBM’s global workforce, and we expect to exit 2024 at roughly the same level of employment as we entered with.\"\nThe word \"roughly\" here is doing a lot of work – IBM shed almost 12,000 jobs in 2024, a period in which close to 3,000 open positions were added in India.\nIBM in its 2024 Annual Report [PDF] said it had finished the year with 270,300 employees within the company or at wholly owned subsidiaries, plus 8,900 at partially owned subsidiaries, and another 14,200 temporary workers. CFO James Kavanaugh in January this year said Big Blue expects \"workforce rebalancing\" in 2025 to be \"fairly consistent to prior years.\"\nIn its 2023 Annual report [PDF], those figures were 282,200 employees, 8,700 at partially owned subsidiaries, and 14,400 temporary workers.\nJust looking at the employment total for IBM and wholly owned subsidiaries, that's a headcount reduction of 11,900, or 4.2 percent for 2024. Our prior estimate of 9,000 job cuts in 2025 may need to be revised upward. ®\nDo you know more? Is there a story that needs to be told in your world of enterprise IT?

'inspired' by PWHL Fifty-nine girls’ teams playing for Silver Stick supremacy. \"This is one of my first time’s being here, so I really want to win this,\" says Ellie Ryan, a 12U player for Livonia, who crossed the border from Michigan to play in the tournament. Nearly 1,000 girls ranging from 11U to 18U were all in Sarnia, Ont. this weekend. The Arapahoe Warriors came all the way from Denver, Colorado where the girl's game is still in its growing phase. \"Our organization had 4-5 girls a few years ago, now we have 14-15 at the pee wee level,\" says Terry Bevan, a coach with the Warriors. \"The younger teams have full teams with 15-20 girls and they are playing just girls hockey. There is also multiple teams in the mountains, and with the Avs (Colorado Avalanche) and DU (Denver University) you can feel it build its great.\" The women’s game is only going to trend upwards with the creation of the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL). \"Typically it was just NHL and not much girls’ hockey, but glad they are getting into that,\" says Mackenzie Pomerantz, a 12U player from Livonia. Lara Kelly sent her North Halton team to the U18 finals with a double-overtime game winner, to break a scoreless tie. She is thrilled that the PWHL is giving something for female hockey players to strive toward. \"It's giving young girls the hope of having a career in women's hockey,\" says Kelly. \"Especially this year with the big change, it’s something big for women because they worked so hard to get here.\" Coach Jenna Abeyta speaks to her Arapahoe Warriors team from Denver, Colorado during an intermission break at the Silver Stick Tournament in Sarnia, Ont. (Source: Brent Lale/CTV London)Warriors coach Jenna Abeyta was a University teammate of some current PWHL players. \"Our dream growing up was to make the NHL as a girl, but now they have a PWHL,\" says Abeyta, who left Colorado to play University in Massachusetts. \"There is definitely some girls on our team that have high hopes, and having the PWHL they get to see themselves play at that level.\" And for the Livonia team, they’d love to see Detroit become a PWHL expansion franchise. \"I’d love to be able to go watch a game,\" says Pomerantz.
