    "text": "[Weather](/wisconsin/across-wi/weather) Massive Solar Flare Could Bring Northern Lights To WI This Week The sun fired off another massive solar flare early Thursday morning, further increasing the chances of seeing the northern lights. WISCONSIN — The sun fired off another massive solar flare early Thursday morning, further increasing the chances of seeing the colorful northern lights in Wisconsin on Thursday, Friday, and into the weekend. Thursday’s strong [X9.0 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841828583502700945), the strongest of the current solar cycle, followed Tuesday’s [X7.1 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047), increasing the chances the aurora borealis could dip far into the nation’s midsection, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Wisconsin weather conditions look favorable for aurora chasers. Find out what's happening in Across Wisconsinwith free, real-time updates from Patch. The sun is currently at or near “solar maximum,” the peak in its 11-year cycle when heightened geomagnetic storming [increases the chances of seeing the aurora](https://patch.com/us/across-america/sun-nears-solar-maximum-peak-more-northern-lights-displays-likely) far south of its Arctic range. Thursday’s X9.0 flare was stronger than the X8.7 flare in May that [pushed the aurora to near nation’s southern border](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-far-south-alabama-weekend) in a spectacular display seen around the world. Find out what's happening in Across Wisconsinwith free, real-time updates from Patch. “Flares of this magnitude in and around solar maximum are generally not common, although not necessarily unusual,” NOAA said in a statement on the social media platform X. But, the agency cautioned, “solar flares of this magnitude can be impulsive,” meaning they are quick to rise and decrease. Some last minutes, while others go on for a few hours. The chances of seeing northern lights generally increase around the [fall equinox](https://patch.com/us/across-america/when-1st-day-fall-2024-what-know-autumnal-equinox), when the sun produces a surplus of geomagnetic storms — almost twice the annual average — but this fall and the coming year should be especially spectacular as Solar Cycle 25 reaches its peak, which NOAA predicts will occur from November through March 2026. The ethereal curtains of pink, purple, green and yellow light have been seen in multiple U.S. locations over the past several months. The Space Weather Prediction Center’s [aurora dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) is a good site to bookmark for aurora chasers. In general, the best times to see the northern lights are within an hour or two of midnight. [Geomagnetic storms](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms) start with the explosions, or solar flares, of superheated gasses that can be as powerful as a [billion hydrogen bombs](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/space-weather/solar-flares/what-is-a-solar-flare). When this happens, the electron- and proton-charged magnetic particles hurtling toward our planet in a coronal mass ejection, or CME, can temporarily disrupt Earth’s magnetic fields, sending the oval aurora south of its Arctic home, but also potentially disrupting satellite systems and GPS and radio communications.

On arrive à lancer le SCAF, et on arrive à lancer le MGCS.\" Emmanuel Chiva est satisfait: le délégué général de l'Armement, invité de Good Morning Business ce lundi, a évoqué la progression des deux programmes d'armement européen du futur.\nLe SCAF -projet aérien autour d'un avion de combat, de drones et d'un cloud de combat , piloté par la France aux côtés de l'Allemagne et de l'Espagne- et le MGCS, son équivalent dans les véhicules terrestres, avec un char lourd piloté par l'Allemagne, avancent et vont rentrer, après la signature du second la semaine dernière , dans une phase opérationnelle.\nIls sont lancés dans leur première phase, la phase 1B inclut notamment des démonstrateurs. Airbus et Dassault coopèrent, on a un équilibre de la même manière qu'on a un équilibre entre les 4 entreprises sur le MGCS (KNDS France et Allemagne, Thalès et Rheinmetall). Le MGCS aura une société de projet qui associera à parts égales entre les deux pays et le premier contrat sera notifié tout début 2025\", a assuré Emmanuel Chiva.\nLes deux projets sont des enjeux de souveraineté pour la France et l'Allemagne. Si le SCAF est sous leadership français, l'Allemagne va piloter le MGCS : le fruit d'un compromis.\nIA et quantique Le DGA a également évoqué la montée en cadence de l'industrie de défense européenne, confrontée aux besoins de l'Ukraine sur le front. Après avoir identifié \"200 goulets d'étranglement\" en 2023, une cinquantaine persiste aujourd'hui, selon le ministère des Armées. Dans le terrestre, la poudre et les productions d'obus sont notamment sous tension.\nIl a enfin souligné la nécessité de développer plusieurs filières stratégiques, à commencer par les drones, dont la DGA soutient les essais lancés par l'entreprise Turgis et Gaillard .\nD'autres technologies, comme le quantique, vont s'avérer décisives selon Emmanuel Chiva : \"Je suis convaincu que cette rupture technologique peut engendrer des ruptures géopolitiques, dans le domaine des capteurs, dans le calcul.\" Il a aussi souligné l'importance de l'intelligence artificielle, alors que la France a lancé cet hiver une nouvelle agence dédiée au développement de l'IA dans le domaine militaire.\nValentin Grille Les plus lus\n8 mai et Ascension: que risquent les parents qui feraient sécher les cours à leurs enfants?",

    "text": "DBEDT: Impact of Maui wildfires continues, but with effort to reinvigorate jobs, economy After recording three consecutive months of decreases in both visitor arrivals and visitor spending, November 2023 data showed a modest growth in visitor arrivals, but total visitor spending continued to decline compared to a year ago, according to state data. The data was detailed by the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism and includes highlights from Maui and the fire impacted area of Lahaina. On Nov. 1, 2023, most of West Maui, except for historic Lahaina Town areas destroyed by the August wildfires, reopened to tourism in an effort to bring back jobs and help Maui’s economy recover. “The impact of the Maui wildfires continues to be felt in November’s figures, but with most of West Maui now reopened to tourism, there is a concerted effort to reinvigorate job opportunities and facilitate the economic recovery of Maui,” said DBEDT Director James Kunane Tokioka. There were 161,522 visitors to Maui in November 2023. While still below November 2022 (230,380 visitors, -29.9%) and November 2019 (232,330 visitors, -30.5%) levels, this was the highest number of visitors to Maui in the last four months. Visitor spending was $375.5 million in November 2023, lower than November 2022 ($451.2 million, -16.8%) and November 2019 ($377.9 million, -0.6%) according to the DBEDT. The average daily census on Maui was 45,154 visitors in November 2023, compared to 62,613 visitors (-27.9%) in November 2022 and 61,437 visitors (-26.5%) in November 2019. In the first 11 months of 2023, there were 2,280,349 visitors to Maui, compared to 2,660,079 visitors (-14.3%) in the first 11 months of 2022 and 2,784,485 visitors (-18.1%) in the first 11 months of 2019. For the first 11 months of 2023, total visitor spending was $5.25 billion, compared to $5.25 billion (+0.2%) in the first 11 months of 2022 and $4.61 billion (+13.7%) in the first 11 months of 2019. Statewide, a total of 731,233 visitors came to the Hawaiian Islands in November 2023, up 0.3% from November 2022. When compared to pre-pandemic 2019, this represents a 90.4% recovery in total visitor arrivals from November 2019. As measured in nominal dollars, total visitor spending was $1.53 billion in November 2023, a decrease from November 2022 ($1.57 billion, -2.4%), but higher than November 2019 ($1.34 billion, +14.2%). In November 2023, 720,297 visitors arrived by air service, mainly from the US West and US East. Additionally, 10,936 visitors came via out-of-state cruise ships. In comparison, 719,022 visitors (+0.2%) arrived by air and 9,866 visitors (+10.8%) came by cruise ships in November 2022, and 792,547 visitors (-9.1%) arrived by air and 16,529 visitors (-33.8%) came by cruise ships in November 2019. The average length of stay by all visitors in November 2023 was 8.75 days, compared to 9.05 days (-3.4%) in November 2022 and 8.30 days (+5.5%) in November 2019. There were 62,893 visitors from Japan in November 2023, which was a significant increase compared to November 2022 (25,968 visitors, +142.2%), but was still much lower than November 2019 (131,536 visitors, -52.2%). Visitors from Japan spent $94.7 million in November 2023, compared to $43.2 million (+119.4%) in November 2022 and $189.4 million (-50.0%) in November 2019. Daily spending by Japanese visitors in November 2023 ($249 per person) was more than November 2022 ($240 per person, +3.6%), but was less than November 2019 ($256 per person, -2.6%). The influx of visitors from Japan remains strong with 62,893 arrivals and a recovery rate of 47.8%, marking the highest recovery rate since April 2020. “We maintain an optimistic outlook on the Japanese market, anticipating its continued contribution to tourism as we progress into 2024,” said DBEDT Director James Kunane Tokioka. In November 2023, a total of 4,763 transpacific flights with 1,048,648 seats serviced the Hawaiian Islands, compared to 4,716 flights (+1.0%) with 1,026,142 seats (+2.2%) in November 2022 and 4,881 flights (-2.4%) with 1,072,805 seats (-2.3%) in November 2019.
