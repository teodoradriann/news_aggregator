    "text": "Warm, dry winter heightens drought concerns Published 2:47 pm Friday, March 22, 2024 Year-round water conservation is beneficial With less than half the average snowfall across much of the state and extraordinarily warm winter temperatures, drought conditions in Minnesota have persisted through the winter. Abnormally dry conditions exist throughout the state and about half of Minnesota is in moderate or severe drought. Minnesota has experienced significant drought conditions each year since 2021. The 2021 drought was the most severe in Minnesota since at least 1988. Email newsletter signup Drought in 2023 was generally less severe, but some areas of the state experienced conditions comparable to or worse than 2021. “While climatologists don’t issue forecasts, we want everyone to recognize that, without substantial precipitation this spring, a continuation of widespread drought conditions in 2024 is likely,” State Climatologist Luigi Romolo said. Sixty-five surface water appropriation permits remain suspended due to last year’s low streamflow conditions. These locations and other watersheds will be monitored closely to support decisions on suspending or reinstating surface water appropriation permits. Surface water appropriation suspensions are implemented when streamflows drop to a low level measurement called the Q90, which is a flow that is exceeded 90% of the time. Weekly streamflow reports typically resume the first week of April. Recent drought events in Minnesota highlight the importance of year-round efficient water use and conservation. The DNR website (mndnr.gov/waters/watermgmt_section/appropriations/conservation.html) has information about what individuals, families, businesses and communities can do to conserve water. More information about drought is available on the DNR drought webpage (mndnr.gov/climate/drought).",

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "While Tropical Cyclone Alfred has slowed down, it could still bring life-threatening impacts.\nThe category 2 cyclone is set to hit south-east Queensland and northern NSW's coastlines at around midday on Saturday with damaging winds, flash flooding, and dangerous storm tides predicted.\nHowever, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) now forecasts the cyclone will have downgraded to a category 1 system by the time it crosses onto the mainland.\nHere's the latest on what you can expect from Cyclone Alfred today, tomorrow, and this weekend.\nWhen will Cyclone Alfred hit? It's estimated that Cyclone Alfred will hit the coastline about a day later than originally forecast, and is expected to cross the coast at about 12pm AEST (1pm AEDT) on Saturday, most likely between Noosa and Coolangatta.\nThe BoM's latest update has pushed the cyclone's arrival back by about a day, with original forecast saying it would hit the coast overnight on Thursday and into Friday morning.\nThe latest predicted path of Cyclone Alfred Credit: Bureau of Meteorology In the BoM's latest update, Alfred will hit coastal areas from Double Island Point in Queensland to east of Grafton in NSW, including Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina.\nThe town of Grafton itself is expected to lie outside the cyclone's path.\nHow severe will Cyclone Alfred be? Alfred is expected weaken to a category 1 storm before making landfall, BoM announced late on Friday morning.\nBoM Brisbane manager Matthew Collopy said this meant that \"destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself\", but added that \"damaging wind gusts up to 120km/h are expected, and they will develop quickly as the system approaches\".\nAccording to the BoM, category 1 cyclones have damaging winds and generally cause \"negligible house damage\" and \"damage to some crops, trees and caravans\".\nThey have maximum average wind speeds of between 63–88 km/h, with strongest winds of up to 125 km/h.\nREAD MORE The Albanese factor behind Tropical Cyclone Alfred's last-minute name change\nHowever, a cyclone's ranking doesn't take into account the severe flood risk that comes with heavy rain and storm surges, which could be incredibly destructive.\nFederal Emergency Management Minister Jenny McAllister said earlier on Friday at \"all of our advice essentially to communities remains the same — this is a significant weather system.\"\n\"There are preparations that we need you to undertake now and it is a time when we need you to take care of your friends and families and listen to the guidance from authorities,\" she told ABC News Breakfast.\n\"If anything, what I'd say to communities today is that the uncertainty about the window at which the cyclone will cross remains. We do need people to be alert, to be listening to emergency broadcasts, to be checking the apps, and just keeping themselves informed of the risks that might confront them over the course of the week.\"\nREAD MORE Queensland faces Alfred's 'second phase', as Lismore braces for 'entirely different game'\nAlfred slowing doesn't mean it won't intensify At a Canberra press conference on Friday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said while the cyclone had slowed down, it didn't mean it would be a less intense one.\n\"We absolutely need to prepare for the worst,\" he said.\n\"This is already having an impact, and the impact with the slowing of the Cyclone Alfred in its journey westward to the coast, we should not think that slower means better.\"\n\"It's not clear that it could intensify as well as it is over warmer waters. It has the potential to increase the intensity of it.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said while the cyclone has slowed down, it didn't mean it would be less intense. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch What's the latest BoM forecast Things are changing quickly in south-east Queensland and northern NSW, but based on current BoM forecasts:\nRainfall, flooding and surf conditions: Heavy to locally intense rainfall, which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is likely to develop from Friday afternoon and continue near and south of the system centre during the weekend. Separate Severe Weather Warning, Flood Watches, and Flood Warnings are current for southeast Queensland and northeast NSW. Abnormally high tides are likely to continue causing minor flooding of coastal low lying areas between Double Island Point and Ballina, particularly during the high tide, which will peak early on Saturday. Damaging surf leading to significant beach erosion remains likely for the open beaches between Double Island Point and Grafton, and further south over the NSW coast. READ MORE What airlines are offering travellers as Tropical Cyclone Alfred sparks cancellations\nWild wind: Gales with damaging wind gusts of up to 120 kilometres per hour are occurring near the coast between Cape Moreton and Yamba and are expected to extend along the remaining southeast Queensland and northeastern NSW coastal and island communities between Noosa and Yamba later today as Alfred approaches the coast. These winds may extend as far south as Grafton and northwards to Double Island Point in the evening or Saturday morning. Destructive wind gusts of up to 155 kilometres per hour may develop about the Moreton Bay Islands and exposed coastal location on the northern Gold Coast from tonight, as Alfred's destructive core approaches the coast. The destructive winds may persist until Alfred crosses the coast early Saturday morning. Although Alfred is expected to weaken and move inland during Saturday, damaging wind gusts may continue, particularly over elevated terrain during Saturday, before easing throughout during Sunday.",
