    "text": "BRUSELAS, 13 Sep. (EUROPA PRESS) - El aeropuerto de Charleroi, en el sur de Bélgica, ha anunciado la cancelación de todos los vuelos programados para este viernes debido a la extensión de la huelga de trabajadores de tierra que tiene paralizado por segunda jornada seguida el aeropuerto. En un comunicado, el gestor del aeropuerto de Charleroi señala que debido a la huelga sindical conjunta de este viernes todos los vuelos quedan anulados y pide a los pasajeros que no acudan a las instalaciones del aeródromo. \"Lamentamos el impacto de estas acciones y pedimos disculpas por las molestias causadas\", subraya. La acción sindical comenzó este jueves afectando a la totalidad de las operaciones aéreas previstas, con unos 200 vuelos cancelados y 30.000 pasajeros que se quedaron en tierra. La huelga que afecta a la gestión de equipajes, la facturación o repostaje de aviones se mantiene este viernes después de que no llegaran a buen puerto las negociaciones entre sindicatos y dirección del aeropuerto, que contaban con la participación de la ministra valona encargada de Aeropuertos, Cécile Neven. Desde la autoridad aeroportuaria critican que la huelga es \"salvaje\" y no respeta el preaviso presentado por los sindicatos el pasado 4 de septiembre y que da 15 días de margen para realizar los paros. Por su lado, los sindicatos han tildado de \"histórico\" el seguimiento de la huelga e insisten en denunciar el hacinamiento y la presión sobre las condiciones de trabajo.",

The Central American nation famed for its beaches and lush landscapes that power ecotourism normally gets about 70% of its electricity supply from the plants. [Reuters](https://www.devdiscourse.com/reuters-stories)| Updated: 10-05-2024 02:16 IST | Created: 10-05-2024 02:16 IST Struck by the worst drought in five decades, Costa Rica announced an electricity rationing plan on Thursday, blaming a severe lack of rainfall that has hobbled hydroelectric plants. The Central American nation famed for its beaches and lush landscapes that power ecotourism normally gets about 70% of its electricity supply from the plants. State-run electricity company ICE has blamed the drought conditions partly on the weather phenomenon known as El Nino. Roberto Quiros, ICE's electricity director, described water levels at main reservoirs as \"critical,\" adding the current El Nino is the most severe on record. He also pointed to delays in contracted deliveries from private power plants. The country last saw electricity rationing in 2007. The power cuts, to be implemented next Monday, are scheduled to last up to three hours daily but will not affect hospitals, industry or other high-voltage customers. ICE is also asking residential users to reduce consumption as much as possible. President Rodrigo Chaves has said he prays every day for rain as his requests to purchase energy from Costa Rica's neighbors have proved difficult since power shortages have also hit the broader region. Widespread power cuts blamed on a heat wave also hit Mexico earlier this week, in addition to similar problems in Colombia and Ecuador. The lack of rains has accompanied unusually unpredictable wind patterns, ICE officials noted, which has hit supplies from wind farms. This week, the company announced an alert signaling the possibility of rationing along with a so far unrealized forecast for imminent rainfall. Costa Rica's rainy season usually kicks off at the end of April. An uptick in demand has further complicated ICE's ability to meet it. Official data for January showed a 9% rise in electricity consumption compared to the same month last year.

    "text": "© ANDBZ/ABACA - Quartier des Minguettes à Vénissieux Plusieurs élus LR de la municipalité de Vénissieux (Rhône) ont déposé un signalement concernant la présence d’une mosquée au sein d’un foyer municipal. La préfecture va étudier le dossier, rapporte Le Figaro. À Vénissieux (Rhône), dans le quartier des Minguettes, dans la banlieue sud de Lyon, le foyer Debussy est utilisé depuis plusieurs années comme un lieu de culte. Une affiche précise même \"Mosquée Es-Salam\" en lettres blanches sur fond vert à l’entrée. Mais cela ne plaît guère aux élus des Républicains, rapporte Le Figaro vendredi 23 février. Cette situation a été dénoncée par le groupe d’opposition au conseil municipal \"Vénissieux en mieux\", composé de deux élus Les Républicains. Un autre membre du groupe, employé sur le secteur par le parti, a déposé un signalement auprès du procureur de la République de Lyon et de la préfète du Rhône, mercredi 21 février. \"La mairie de Vénissieux met à disposition de la Mosquée Es-Salam la salle Claude Debussy pour des activités cultuelles, en contradiction flagrante avec les dispositions légales en vigueur car cette mise à disposition est continue et pérenne\", explique notamment Quentin Taïeb. Selon lui, c’est \"une situation préoccupante qui porte atteinte au principe de laïcité et à l'ordre public\". Pour la maire de la ville, cette présence est légale En réponse, la maire de la commune, Michèle Picard (PCF), a affirmé que cette situation était bien légale. \"Deux associations sur la dizaine qui utilisent les lieux ont des activités cultuelles mais il s'agit d'associations de type loi 1901, avec une convention d'occupation, comme un club sportif. Ces associations payent les charges, en toute légalité\", a-t-elle réagi auprès du Figaro. \"Cette décision ne doit pas revêtir un caractère exclusif et pérenne comme précisée par le Conseil d'État\", a insisté Quentin Taïeb. La préfecture a reçu le signalement et va l’étudier. Le conseiller municipal demande ainsi de \"libérer la salle Claude Debussy de son utilisation exclusive par la Mosquée Es-Salam\" et pointe \"la propension de Michèle Picard à pratiquer le communautarisme\". publié le 23 février à 18h57, Lilian Moy, 6Medias",

    "text": "As Hurricane Milton struck Florida, a fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico. The captain faced extreme conditions in the sea before finally being rescued by the US Coast Guard.— ABC (@ABC) The captain, whose name was not released, went out early at around 3 am on Wednesday to repair his broken boat ‘Captain Dave,’ as reported by the Washington Post.Around noon, the boat’s owner reported to the Coast Guard that the captain hadn’t checked in. “Watchstanders were able to make radio contact with the captain who reported the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port,” the US Coast Guard agency said in the release.The fishing vessel earlier in the week had broken down some 20 miles off John’s Pass in Pinellas County, and the captain and another crew member were rescued from it on Monday, but the vessel was left with salvage arrangements to be made.At that time, the Coast Guard reported winds of around 30 mph and waves reaching 6-8 feet. As conditions worsened with Hurricane Milton approaching, Coast Guard officials instructed the captain to wear a life jacket and keep the boat's emergency beacon close to ensure he could be located.However, by 6:45 pm, roughly two hours before Milton made landfall 20 miles south of John’s Pass, the Coast Guard lost contact with him. The Coast Guard launched a tedious search and rescue operation at around 5:30 am on Thursday, deploying airplane and helicopter crews.After a harrowing night of survival, the captain was found clinging to a cooler 30 miles off Longboat Key, around 1:30 pm on Thursday, more than 8 hours later after contact was lost.“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, the Coast Guard’s command center chief in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a news release.The unnamed captain survived the extreme conditions in an incredibly dangerous situation. “He experienced the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot waves, for an extended period of time to include overnight,” Grady said in the release.“He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,” Grady said.",
