    "title": "College Football Playoff: Was Michigan scared to face Alabama?",
    "text": "When the final College Football Playoff rankings were revealed, many were shocked to see which team was granted the fourth and final spot. Alabama, with one loss and an SEC championship, got the nod over undefeated ACC champion Florida State. Fans, players and coaches were caught off guard, but none more than the Seminoles… and Michigan.\nThe one-seeded Wolverines were all together watching the announcement, and the moment was captured on film. Once Alabama’s name was announced, there was a moment of silence where everyone looked around at each other before slowly clapping. There was no true sense of excitement from the room, as seen in the video below posted to social media by ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg.\nMichigan reacts to Alabama being selected at No. 4. Wolverines and Crimson Tide in the CFP semi. pic.twitter.com/V2mrgLQA3W\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 3, 2023\nOnline, the video took off. Fans assumed Michigan’s reaction was out of shock and fear. However, one player now speaks out with an explanation.\n“It’s funny that I keep hearing everybody say we’re scared because we got ‘Bama,” says Wolverines linebacker Michael Barrett. “It was more like the shock of not seeing an undefeated Power 5 team get picked. We kind of figured that all the undefeated teams were going to come & we were just debating on who would slip into that fourth spot. So not seeing Florida State in there, it was kind of a shock to everybody. It wasn’t really like fear, never that, of any team. It was just more that shock. We kind of just were already expecting, ‘okay, if they got (Texas) at 3, then they’ve got to be Florida State at 4.’ “\nBarrett’s explanation makes sense, but many will choose to believe what they want, which is fair. The team was in shock not over who they would be playing and fear that they would lose, but that Florida State was left out of the top four after the season they had.\nThis explanation comes days before they meet the Crimson Tide in Pasadena for the College Football Playoff Rose Bowl semifinal, which goes to show how confident Michigan was then, and how the team feels now.\nRoll Tide Wire will continue to follow Alabama football as the team continues to prepare in the final days leading up to the highly-anticipated matchup.\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.

    "text": "Longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson will take over as head coach at Delaware State, Victory Formation Media and ESPN reported Thursday.\nIf confirmed, it would be the latest data point in a growing trend of FCS football teams hiring well-known former players -- with little to no prior coaching experience -- in an effort to stand out.\nJackson, 38, has no connection to Delaware State but according to ESPN, \"it has always been a dream\" of his to coach at an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities).\nEarlier this month, Norfolk State hired Michael Vick to take over the Spartans' program. Vick, who also reportedly heard from Sacramento State, hails from the Norfolk, Va., area. Norfolk State is one of Delaware State's rivals in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\nColorado coach Deion Sanders spent three seasons (2020-22) as the head coach of Jackson State before moving up to the FBS level. His only prior coaching experience came at the high school level, including at his own short-lived charter school in Texas, \"Prime Prep Academy.\"\nJackson last played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. He is best known for two stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2008-13, 2019-20) and played for a total of six teams in a 15-year NFL career. Jackson caught 641 passes for 11,263 yards and 58 touchdowns, adding four rushing touchdowns and four punt return touchdowns in 183 career games.\nDelaware State went 1-11 in 2024 (0-5 MEAC) and fired coach Lee Hull after the season. The Hornets have not had a winning season since going 6-5 in 2012.\n--Field Level Media REUTERS\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

Then, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cream of tarter. Set aside. With an electric mixer cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar until fluffy, then mix in the oil. Add the egg and vanilla to the butter mixture and beat until combined. Slowly add the dry mixture, and mix until just combined. Form the dough into 2 1/2″ balls or 130 g each. Flatten the dough ball into a 4-5″ cookie. Place the cookies on the baking sheet at least 2 inch apart. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 9-12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack. For the frosting, cream together the butter and powdered sugar until smooth. Slowly add the milk and vanilla until you reach your desired consistency. Add a few drops of pink food coloring. Frost the cooled cookies and store them in the fridge until ready to serve. Notes If you want perfectly sized cookies, I highly recommend that you use the scale method to measure your cookie dough balls. Don’t worry if your cookies are misshapen when they come out of the oven. While they are still warm, gently place a glass upside down over the cookie, and gently roll the cookie inside of the glass. This will give you the perfect round cookie. It’s important to use completely room temperature butter to get a smooth cookie dough and a smooth frosting. For a natural pink color in the frosting you can add beet juice, raspberry puree or strawberry puree in place of pink food coloring.

    "title": "2025光伏企业绿色低碳评价报告发布 - 中化新网",
    "text": "光伏企业绿电利用显著增长，但产业链脱碳仍待加强\n在近日苏州召开的2025光伏绿色供应链研讨会上，公众环境研究中心(IPE)和绿色江南(PECC)发布年度评价报告，显示隆基、晶科、通威等一批头部企业积极推进绿色低碳转型，光伏行业环境信息披露提升，绿电利用显著增长，但光伏行业碳排放持续增加。报告建议龙头企业加强产业链脱碳，为中国乃至全球能源转型做出更大贡献。\n本次评价基于绿色供应链CITI和企业气候行动CATI指数开展，其中CITI指数从管理机制、合规与改善、资源消耗与减少污染物排放、能源使用与应对气候变化、利益方绿色选择五个维度开展量化评价。CATI指数评价则从治理机制、测算披露、碳目标设定、碳目标绩效、减排行动五个维度评价。\n本期评价显示，隆基绿能、晶科能源、通威股份在绿色供应链CITI指数和企业气候行动CATI指数评价中均位列前三名。晶澳科技、TCL中环、阳光电源、天合光能、协鑫科技、阿特斯、东方日升、信义光能和正泰新能分别进入CITI和CATI TOP10。\n2025年一季度，中国风电光伏发电合计新增装机7433万千瓦，累计装机达到14.82亿千瓦，首次超过火电装机，光伏发电累计9.46亿千瓦。截至2025年5月底，中国光伏装机规模突破10亿千瓦。与此同时，中国光伏组件占全球的比例增长到83.41%。\n然而作为“制造绿色”的行业，光伏产业从上游的硅料和硅片生产，中游的电池和组件制造，到末端废弃光伏组件的处置过程都涉及大量的能源和资源消耗，产生大量的碳排放，以及废水、废气和固体废物。\n本期评价范围扩展至55家光伏相关企业，覆盖硅料、硅片、电池片、组件、薄膜、逆变器、玻璃等光伏发电设备生产，以及光伏发电电站建设和运营。评价主要依据企业公开披露的年报、ESG报告、可持续发展报告、企业官网公开信息、蔚蓝地图数据库收集的可信源发布的数据，以及绿色江南开展的实地调研开展。\n本期评价发现，部分光伏企业可再生能源利用成效显著。其中40家企业披露可再生能源利用数据，显示2024年运营及产品生产中使用的可再生能源总计5.71千万兆瓦时，由此带来的减排和抵消量超过3255.14万吨二氧化碳当量。\n对比10家光伏企业设定并披露的可再生能源利用目标，阳光电源和通威股份披露的2024年可再生能源使用在能源消耗总量的占比超过60%;隆基绿能、通威股份、晶科能源和大全股份超过40%。正泰新能、固德威等11家光伏企业，通过铺设屋顶光伏、购买绿电和绿证等措施，打造(近)零碳工厂或园区。\n尽管如此，光伏企业碳排放量仍居高不下。44家企业核算并披露了自身运营(范围1&2)碳排放，最近一年仅范围1和范围2的碳排放量就达到1.05亿吨二氧化碳当量。24家披露连续三年数据的企业，碳排放总量从2022年的4523万吨增加至2024年的7057万吨二氧化碳当量。其中，2023年较2022年增幅达46.6%，2024年较2023年继续小幅增加5.7%，提示光伏行业仍需加速脱碳进程。\n本期评价的第二个发现是，光伏企业环境信息和碳数据披露水平提升，但对标全球领跑者仍有差距。参评企业中，7家企业承诺2050年前实现价值链碳中和，6家减排目标涵盖供应链。隆基绿能和通威股份披露的2024年目标进展显示，范围3碳强度均呈下降趋势。隆基绿能还推动供应商开展碳核算和目标设定，并通过收集供应商实测数据，提升供应链碳排放核算的精准度。通威股份自2025年起推动关联企业公开披露针对过往违规问题的整改措施和合规现状。截至6月底，24家企业已经开展信息披露。\n但光伏行业整体在推动供应链碳管理和追踪供应链目标进展上进展有限，多数企业的供应链脱碳仍仅停留在战略层面或试点阶段，供应链气候信息透明度也有待进一步提升。\n评价显示，头部光伏企业关注产品碳足迹。25家企业核算并披露了超过80个光伏组件、电池、多晶硅料、逆变器等产品的碳足迹数据。显示出光伏企业积极应对部分国家和地区通过光伏产品碳足迹限值、低碳认证等规则，提升了光伏市场的绿色准入门槛。\n光伏产业链中，多晶硅料、硅片以及电池片生产，是水资源消耗的最主要环节。本期评价涉及多晶硅料、硅片、电池片生产的35家企业中，28家披露了水资源消耗量，占比80%，通威股份、协鑫科技等7家企业披露高耗水环节的单位产品水耗。14家企业设定并披露水资源管理目标，隆基绿能、天合光能、协鑫科技、TCL中环、爱旭股份5家企业设定并披露降低产品耗水强度的目标;多数企业同时披露了2024年的目标完成进展。\n本期评价的第三个发现是，领先企业加强供应链环境管理，超过8成公开披露绿色供应链管理要求。10家企业公开披露将环境风险管控延伸到原材料供应商，隆基绿能、通威股份、晶科能源、晶澳科技公开披露关注能源转型矿产开采过程的环境影响。尽管如此，光伏“绿色制造”仍需加强。IPE和绿色江南开展的调研显示，12家参评企业的关联企业2024年以来仍出现超标排放废气污染物、超许可限值取水、未落实重污染天气红色预警减排措施等违规问题;其中仅2家公开披露整改措施和环境合规现状。\n近年来，光伏电站建设和运营对生物多样性的影响引起越来越多利益方的关注。本期评价显示，晶澳科技、东方日升、阳光电源、信义光能、特变电工、易成新能等11家从事光伏电站建设和运营的企业，公开披露在电站的规划和选址时关注其是否位于生物多样性敏感区域，严格落实生态保护红线管理要求。TCL中环、晶澳科技、天合光能、东方日升公开承诺将关注供应链的生物多样性影响，但尚无企业披露如何降低硅矿以及能源转型关键矿产开采环节对生物多样性的影响。\n据中国光伏行业协会预计，2025年，中国将开始产生大批量退役光伏组件;2030年后，光伏组件废弃量将迎来高峰期。本期评价中涉及组件生产的31家企业中，16家企业披露了2024年开展的废旧组件回收工作，包括参与回收标准体系建设、提升组件可回收性、建设回收示范产线;但企业披露的回收行动以及量化数据统计仍主要集中在欧洲市场。这主要是因为中国的光伏组件回收仍面临多重挑战，包括“生产者责任延伸制”尚未发展为废旧组件强制回收机制、回收利用产业链尚未形成、回收与拆解技术尚不成熟。\n根据国际可再生能源署(IRENA)的预测 ，为达成COP28提出的目标，可再生能源装机容量在2030年前每年需增长16.6%。在这样的发展机遇下，中国的光伏产业快速发展，并已经成为可参与国际竞争并取得领先优势的产业。\n然而，近年来，这一战略性新兴产业出现低价无序竞争等问题。国际方面，在地缘政治紧张的背景下，供应链安全被赋予前所未有的重要性。多国陆续出台光伏产业激励机制，支持本地光伏产业的发展，提升本土光伏制造能力，满足对可再生能源装机的需求。在全球迈向绿色低碳发展的大背景下，报告建议中国光伏企业有必要关注国际上对资源能源消耗、温室气体排放、生物多样性等方面的准入要求，尽快推进自身产业链的绿色低碳转型，提升绿色竞争力。报告同时建议各方共同关注光伏行业在减污降碳方面的进展和态势，合力构建约束激励机制，推动光伏企业践行“绿色制造”，打造绿色低碳供应链，助力美丽中国建设，合力应对全球环境和气候危机。\n2025光伏绿色供应链研讨会由北京市企业家环保基金会、绿色江南公众环境关注中心、公众环境研究中心、长三角太阳能光伏技术创新中心主办，江苏省光伏产业协会、苏州市光伏产业协会、苏高新绿普惠碳中和促进中心、苏高新碳中和国际研究院协办。来自相关部委和研究机构的专家、地方政府和国际机构代表、行业协会和光伏企业代表，以及NGO和第三方机构等嘉宾出席了本次研讨会。\n国家统计局7月31日公布数据显示，2024年我国“三新”经济增加值为242908亿元，比上年增长6.7%，比同期国内生产总值（GDP）现价增速高2.5个百分点；占GDP的比重为18.01%，比上年提高...\n日前，江苏印发《关于推进高新区和高等院校协同创新发展的实施意见》，打造江苏特色的科技创新和产业创新深度融合体系《实施意见》提出，到2027年，实现全省高新区与高校协同创新发展（...\n中共中央政治局7月30日召开会议，分析研究当前经济形势，部署下半年经济工作，为完成全年经济社会发展目标任务、实现“十四五”圆满收官指明了前进方向。 巩固拓展经济回升向好势头 今年上半年，面.....\n7月29日，2025年《财富》世界500强排行榜公布。沃尔玛连续第十二年成为全球最大公司，亚马逊保持第二，中国的国家电网公司继续位列第三，排在第四和第五位的分别是沙特阿美和中国石油，中国石化位居第...\n就当前经济形势和下半年经济工作中共中央召开党外人士座谈会习近平主持并发表重要讲话李强通报有关情况王沪宁蔡奇丁薛祥出席 新华社北京7月30日电 7月23日，中共中央在中南海召开党外人士座谈会...",
