    "text": "Founder of Afe Babalola University Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), Aare Afe Babalola, SAN, has emerged as the 2024 African Man of the Year in Food Security by the Global Food Security Committee of the Initiative for Green Sustainability.\nSpeaking with newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital, on Wednesday, the renowned lawyer said he received the letter from the organisation, defeating other nominees across Sub-Saharan Africa.\nHe revealed that the Award Committee Lead, Tim Grunguis, and Country Director, Caleb Osasona, said that he (Babalola) defeated nine other leading African farmer nominees from Botswana, Malawi, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Cameroon, Rwanda, Zambia, and Liberia.\nRelated PostsReps member, Idahosa, donates transformer to Edo IDP campAkeredolu’s death, a monumental loss — Olabode George Army decorates five newly promoted Brigadier Generals, three others in Borno\nBabalola, reputed to be one of the leading farmers in Nigeria and the largest single farmer in his home state, Ekiti, where he also doubles as the highest taxpayer and second largest employer of labour after the state government, said he was elated by the nomination.\nHe said the award would spur him to do more in his singular efforts, aimed at returning agriculture to its rightful place and lifting it to the expected destination of a competitive revenue earner.\nOn the yardsticks used in the award rating, Babalola said the letter explained that he was able to beat others through his many radical revolutions on agriculture, namely: ABUAD Bio-Diversified Farms, granting millions of Naira under the Afe Babalola Annual Agricultural Grants to hundreds of farmers; ABUAD Talent Discovery Centre; ABUAD Planetarium; ABUAD Industrial Pack, which houses over 132 farm industries; and ABUAD FM Radio, among several others.\nBabalola said, ” As part of my resolve to encourage agriculture among Nigerians, especially youths, I reduced the school fees of students in my university studying agriculture by 50 per cent. In addition, I give seed money of N250,000 to every graduate in agriculture.\n“At the same time, in the last ten years, I have been organising the Annual Agric Festival in Ado-Ekiti, with the best farmer in the state going home with N2 million, while others that came behind them got their lump in millions as well.”\nHe appealed to President Bola Tinubu to tow his line of agriculture revolution by commencing the process of reviving all moribund farm settlements across the country as created by the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\nThe legal luminary said revamping the moribund farm settlements in different regions of the country would boost food security and agricultural production for local consumption, as well as boost exports and provide raw materials for industries.\nAccording to him, this would also create job opportunities for the unemployed youths in the country, and the level of insecurity would be reduced to the barest minimum as they would be gainfully engaged.\nHe said, “It may not be a crime to abandon agriculture, but it is certainly a sin. Don’t forget the Garden of Eden, placed under Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis. This is a divine instruction that a man must work and provide for whatever he needs.\n“Special tribute goes to the First Premier of the old Western Region, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who appreciated the importance of agriculture. Between 1960 and 1966, he promoted agriculture more than any of his peers in other regions.\n“Part of the activities of Chief Awolowo in promoting agriculture are the establishment of 20 farm settlements, the Western Nigeria Marketing Board, and providing healthy and improved seedlings to the farmers.\n“Others include encouraging the production of food and cash crops, making the local government provide implements for farmers, and making agriculture a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools.\n“Consequently, people became interested in agricultural practices, as a result of which the western region became the leader in the production of cocoa and palm oil.\n“Regrettably, most of the leaders, after the existence of Chief Awolowo, abandoned agriculture since the discovery of crude oil and rely solely on its proceeds as a major source of revenues. Its neglect has contributed in no small measure to spiralling inflation, unemployment, and food insecurity.\nHe, however, called for increased annual budgetary allocations to the agriculture sector because it has the potential to lead millions of Nigerians out of poverty and provide food security.”\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nPrimate Ayodele releases 91-page prophecy for 2024\nThe leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released his prophecies for 2024 as it is…\nNIMC issues new guidelines for date of birth modification\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued new guidelines for the modification of…\nSen Natasha spreads Christmas cheer with generous palliatives in Kogi Central\nIn commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), has put smiles on…\nFive Nigerian musicians who had the biggest hit songs in 2023\nNigeria’s music industry had a remarkable year, with talented singers and hit songs making…\nHistory will judge me, I gave Nigeria my best as ‘president,’ IBB declares\nFormer military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) has said history will judge him as leader of the country for…\nAnthony Joshua beats Otto Wallin in five rounds\nAnthony Joshua delivered one of his best displays in recent memory with an impressive stoppage of Otto Wallin in…\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Its information technology department secured the network, making several systems temporarily unavailable.\nThe hacker attempted to encrypt the company’s systems but failed. Group Health reported the incident to the FBI and hired outside help to restore and verify the security of its network and investigate the attack.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\nOn Feb. 9, the company discovered indications that the attacker had copied some of its data, including protected health information. The stolen data may include names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth or death, Group Health member numbers, Medicare numbers and Medicaid numbers.\nUW Health says information on some patients compromised in cybersecurity incident\n“Our discovery was confirmed when the attacker, a foreign ransomware gang, contacted (Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin) claiming responsibility for the attack and stealing our data,” the statement said. “We have no indication that information has been used or further disclosed.”\nGroup Health representatives on Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuits. Spokesperson Kate McLaughlin said current and past members of the HMO, which has about 80,000 members, and current and past patients of its providers are included in the total of more than 500,000 people.\nGroup Health said it has taken additional steps to mitigate harm by working with the FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It has informed potentially affected individuals, state and federal agencies and consumer reporting agencies.\n“To reduce the risk of this happening again, we have implemented enhanced security measures across all our systems and networks,” the HMO said. “This includes strengthening existing controls, data backup, user training and awareness, and other measures.”\nPeople with questions can call member services at 800-605-4327.

Llevan días avisando y además de que estoy oyendo un montón de tráfico - en día festivo - de gente que va y viene por la carretera en una zona de las catalogadas como más peligrosas, toda lammañana los escopeteroos dale que le pego desde las montañas y desde zonas de torrente. No sé cómo aún no nos hemos extinguido. MIGUEL BOSÉ TIENE RAZÓN ABRAN LOS OJOS Ibn Sidala adecuación de los torrentes que no transcurren por zona urbana compete a la Direcció General de Recursos Hídrics, dependiente del Govern. Los ayuntamientos también tienen responsabilidades es su limpieza si pasa por el nucleo urbano Pues ya sabes quien tendrá la culpa si pasa un desastre.... Pd. Si te caen 500litros por metro cuadrado... No sirve de nada tener torrrentes limpios... Mejor estar lo mas lejos posible.. Necesitamos BUENOS GESTORES, especialistas en sus materias, con experiencia y formación en su cargo, no políticos arribistas, analfabetos y ladrones. Con la estrategia del “Divide y vencerás” nos tienen a todo un país enfrentado, mientras ellos nos siguen robando y riéndose en nuestra cara. Cuando los ciudadanos nos demos cuenta de que los políticos TODOS son un gasto inútil avanzaremos como sociedad. Esto tiene que estallar por algún lado. A7Els mallorquins de sa illa deim “dotbers” i feim uns del article salat, tal com diu sa constitucio, que els dialectes siran objecte de estudi i de us. Respetau ses nostres costums mallorquines per favor. Gracis A ver si aprendemos que los políticos solo están para enriquecerse y vivir estupendamente. Yo respeto las ideas y diferentes formas de pensar, izquierdas, derechas. Pero a ver si nos damos cuenta que los políticos se escudan en las ideas para saquearnos. Prostituyen las ideas y nosotros por ideales les votamos, pero la realidad es que ellos no defienden esos ideales solamente se escudan tras ellos. Abramos los ojos Como les gusta meter miedo a la gente. La próxima pandemia será el cambio climático.. Manipulado.. Despierten... asi podran decir que estabamos avisados... que buen solecito hoy Ja han surtit tots els lumbreras antigovern a dir de les seves des de el sofà amb un canutillo i canutillo Ibn SidaPues sucedió en época de Franco hechizo el desvío del Turia, gracias a el Valencia no se inundó. Si evidentemente nos tratan como si fuésemos retrasados, no entiendo cuando hay votaciones que la gente siga votando",
