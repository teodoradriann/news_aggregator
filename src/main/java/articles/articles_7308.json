    "text": "This Gym Workout Plan For Beginners Will Help You Build Strength and Endurance\nWalking into the gym for the first time\ncan be intimidating, not just because you want to fit in amongst a sea of regular gym goers. There may be machines you’ve never heard of that you want to try, and even choosing the right free weights can seem daunting if you’ve never lifted before. That’s where this gym workout plan for beginners comes into play. Created with Holly Roser, an NASM-certified personal trainer and owner of Holly Roser Fitness in San Matteo, CA, this gym plan for beginners provides a week’s worth of newbie gym workouts to get you started, and you can build on this routine to keep challenging yourself and get stronger over time.\nThis gym workout routine is not only great for people who are heading to the gym for the first time, but also for those who\nhaven’t worked out in a while. The gym workout plan contains two strength circuits, three days of cardio, and two days of active recovery. “For the first two weeks, your new program should have two strength training days that are three days apart, with cardio days in between,” Roser tells POPSUGAR. As you build your endurance, move up to three cardio days and three strength training days. For the latter, you can use a mix of moves from the circuits in this plan, or check out other strength training workouts such as this basic dumbbell workout or this full-body circuit workout. (You can probably take that step about three weeks after getting comfortable with this routine, Holly says.) Make sure to switch up your forms of cardio, rotating between exercises like running, swimming, dance cardio, and indoor cycling to hit different muscle groups and keep from getting bored.\nReady to move? Follow this gym workout plan for beginners, and you’re sure to feel like a pro in no time.\n– Additional reporting by Lauren Mazzo and Alexis Jones",

    "text": "The [Ford Mustang](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/ford-mustang/) GT3 race car is a serious performance machine but it doesn’t start out that way. In the journey from street legal shell to the track a great many changes happen. In this short video, Ford outlines the details it has to get right to ensure that the Mustang GT3 goes to the grid with optimal aerodynamics. Part one of this docu-series dealt with the beginning stages of development. Part two saw [Ford](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/ford/) Performance and Multimatic craft the beating heart of the Mustang GT3, a V8 built to withstand a beating. Now, the two companies are talking about downforce, braking, and finding the right balance on the track. Early on here we get a quick look at what a Mustang GT3 looks like when [Ford Performance](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/ford-performance/) and Multimatic finally get rid of the street legal street metal that won’t end up on the track. To put it simply, this car ends up being little more than a cabin space. Then, the two companies go to the work of fitting it with FIA-approved parts and pieces that will enable it to stay competitive and safe. More: [Ford Pulls Back The Curtain On New Mustang GT3 Racecar In Docuseries](https://www.carscoops.com/2023/12/ford-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-new-mustang-gt3-racecar-in-docuseries/) Once the body is complete the team almost immediately needs to change parts and pieces that end up having issues on the track. As Aerodynamicist Bernie Marcus points out, rapid prototyping makes the job easier since the team can [create new parts literally overnight](https://www.carscoops.com/2011/07/video-gm-says-3d-rapid-prototyping/). That comes in key too when the team takes the car to a wind tunnel. In fact, different wind tunnels can provide dramatically different results and thus insights that the team can use to improve downforce and speed on the track. Aerodynamics plays a big role in the braking system too though and the team says it went through 22 different braking component packages to find the right mix. As all of this is going on, different specialized teams are working on different pieces of the race car. Watching the group work together is a great reminder of just how intense building a real functional race car can be. The finished Mustang GT3 will sit on the grid at Daytona for its debut on January 27th. This Friday, 1/5, 'The Body' episode of— Ford Performance (@FordPerformance) [#MustangEndurance]drops. See the art of aerodynamics in action. [#BredtoRaceFP] [pic.twitter.com/76gIN7xGRy] [January 2, 2024]",

    "text": "Vancouver’s Catholic Archbishop says a ‘Sacred Covenant’ agreement has been reached with the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., that announced the discovery the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school. Archbishop J. Michael Miller of the Catholic archdiocese of Vancouver says the agreement with the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc will open a “new chapter” in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. Miller says the church recognizes its complicity in the Canadian government’s colonialist policies toward First Nations and the “resulting tragedies” from the residential school system. Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc says the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found the unmarked burial sites of the remains of more than 200 children who were students at the school. The Nation and the archdiocese say the agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and to offer “healing services” to family members of those who attended the school.

    "title": "Florida priest defends Eucharist from sacrilege by biting angry lesbian: 'He wouldn't give me the cookie' - LifeSite",
    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Florida ( LifeSiteNews ) — A Catholic priest may be arrested for defending the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ from an angry lesbian woman who crushed several hosts and tried to illicitly administer herself Holy Communion, prompting him to bite her arm. By all indications, Father Fidel Rodriguez of St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida, acted appropriately when the woman tried to take what she later described to police as “the cookie” from him at a 12 p.m. Mass last Sunday. The woman, whose name is Jetty Nique, left a one-star review of the church on Google. In her now-deleted review, she explains that she is a “proudly gay female” and that she attended the Mass because it was the first Communion of her “girlfriend’s” niece. She expressed anger over the fact that Father Rodriguez “disrespect[ed]” her by initially attempting to give her Communion on the tongue. Father Rodriguez told police when they arrived after the noon liturgy that he had never encountered Nique before and that his actions had nothing to do with her lesbian lifestyle, which he knew nothing about. “I don’t judge nobody,” he told the police. The priest first interacted with Nique at St. Thomas Aquinas Church’s 10 a.m. liturgy. Video footage from the parish’s YouTube channel shows that he had a 55-second conversation with her when it was evident she wasn’t a practicing Catholic because she hadn’t opened her mouth or replied “Amen” when he said, “Body of Christ.” Father Rodriguez asked but she refused to tell him the last time she received Communion and went to confession. He then gave her a blessing. Father Rodriguez recognized Nique when she re-presented herself for Communion at the 12 p.m. Mass, at which point he said he was not judging her but needed to know if she had gone to confession. Nique told him it was “not his business” then extended her arm and “crushed” several consecrated hosts, spilling them on the ground. “He wouldn’t give me the cookie. I don’t know if it was the way I was dressed, or if it is what I like,” she later told police. “I bit her, I am not denying that. I am defending myself and the sacrament,” the priest informed law enforcement. The Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ truly present under the consecrated species of bread and wine, as the Catholic Church teaches. “In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist ‘the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, and substantially contained,'” the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, citing the Council of Trent. Jesus Christ is fully present in each particle of the Eucharist. The Diocese of Orlando, which is led by Bishop John Noonan, has issued a statement supporting Father Rodriguez’s actions. “Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed. The woman was immediately asked to leave.” “While the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect,” the diocese added. “It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement continued. “The full video and the police report show the woman initiated physical contact and acted inappropriately.” Nique eventually went to the police station where the fire department treated her arm. She did not go to the hospital. She plans on filing charges against Father Rodriguez, NBC affiliate WESH-2 reports . LifeSite called St. Thomas Aquinas Church to speak with the priest this morning. Father Rodriguez, 66, serves as the parochial vicar of the church. The receptionist who answered instructed LifeSite to reach out to the Diocese of Orlando’s communication department. LifeSite did so but received a voicemail. According to local media , the St. Cloud police department has handed the case over to the Florida Attorney General’s office for further investigation.",

    "text": "By Nick Starkov\nKYIV (Reuters) – President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that he expected a number of new Western defence packages for Ukraine to be signed this and next month.\n“We are preparing new agreements with partners – strong bilateral agreements,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.\n“January and February should bring corresponding results. There are already specific dates when new and strong documents can be expected.”\nAfter Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv’s Western allies united in providing unprecedented military and other aid to help Zelenskiy defend his country.\nBut with the war now dragging on towards its third year, little change along the front line in the past 12 months and growing opposition to more aid in the United States, funds and equipment in recent months have been slow coming in.\nZelenskiy did not name the countries with which he hoped to finalise agreements. The Ukrainian president has spent weeks on an international diplomatic frenzy trying to secure more political and military support.\nHe has often repeated that Russia’s increased winter air strikes and Moscow’s slow but gruelling offensive in Ukraine’s east have underlined the need for more reinforcement of Kyiv’s air and ground defences.\nEarlier this month, Britain, one of Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, said it will increase its support for Ukraine in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.19 billion).\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he would head to Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral security guarantee deal under which Paris would deliver more sophisticated weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles.\n(Writing by Lidia Kelly in Melbourne; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",
