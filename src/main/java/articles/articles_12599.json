    "title": "Bangkok Post - Thai gold primed for record high",
    "text": "The price of gold bars surged by 400 baht per baht weight on Wednesday as the baht retreated to 33.02-33.04 to the US dollar from Tuesday's close of 32.76.Spot gold was traded in a tight range, edging down 0.1% to US$2,653.95 per ounce as investors were cautious ahead of US economic data that might provide clues about the size of the Fed's rate cuts expected later this year.The precious metal rallied after Iran's missile strikes on Israel, boosting demand for the safe-haven asset.The current price of around $2,650 an ounce is not far from last week's record high of $2,685, as the escalating Israel-Iran conflict means a ceasefire seems unlikely anytime soon.Gold rose 13% between July and September, bringing the price increase to 28% year-to-date.\"The Middle East conflict this time round seems severe,\" said GTA president Jitti Tangsithpakdi.Domestic gold prices have risen by nearly 1,000 baht in the last few days, he said.Although the baht is highly volatile now, which makes it hard to predict, Mr Jitti said domestic prices are likely to reach 44,000 baht per baht weight later this year as Middle East tensions linger, while the Fed is likely to cut US rates by another 50 basis points at its two remaining meetings in 2024.Global gold prices are on course to hit $2,700 an ounce by year-end, he said, with the upward trend poised to continue, pushing the price to $2,900 by early 2025.Mr Jitti's prediction is in line with a forecast by Goldman Sachs, which raised its outlook for early 2025 to $2,900 per ounce, up from $2,700, citing increasing exchange-traded fund flows attributed to interest rate cuts in the West and China, as well as higher central bank purchases.\"We reiterate our long gold recommendation due to the gradual boost from lower global interest rates, structurally higher central bank demand and gold's hedging benefits against geopolitical, financial and recessionary risks,\" the investment bank said in a note.Goldman Sachs raised this year's average gold price forecast to $2,395 per ounce from $2,357 per ounce, and the 2025 outlook to $2,973 per ounce from $2,686 per ounce.The World Gold Council (WGC) said Thailand's gold demand continues to soar despite a series of record-breaking prices, with the Thai gold baht weight reaching a new high of 42,000 baht on April 19, 2024.\"The nation recorded the highest growth in consumer demand across Southeast Asia for the second quarter, with a remarkable 20% year-on-year increase to nine tonnes, as Thai investors turned to gold for protection against the weakened local currency,\" said WGC chief executive David Tait.This sustained robust demand underscores gold's status as a reliable and preferred investment instrument in Thailand, he said.",

    "text": "MARLTON, N.J., Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- An unknown number of patients are being notified that their Social Security numbers and other confidential information may have been compromised in what appears to be a cyberattack against INTEGRIS Health. The data breach lawyers at Console & Associates, P.C. are investigating claims on behalf of anyone who may be affected by a possible INTEGRIS breach, hoping to fully inform them of the risks they face in the wake of the breach as well as their legal rights.\nThe sensitive personal data of INTEGRIS patients may have been compromised. If the hackers' claims are correct, victims' full names, Social Security numbers and other personal information may be in the hands of criminals, putting victims at a greater risk of identity theft and other frauds.\nOn December 24, 2023, INTEGRIS posted a website notice describing what the company calls a \"data privacy incident.\" According to the notice, INTEGRIS was in the process of investigating a possible cyberattack when patients began receiving communications directly from those who claimed to have carried out the attack. The possible INTEGRIS breach is a developing situation, and more information is expected shortly.\nThe list of sensitive information that was possibly exposed includes patients':\n- Names,\n- Dates of birth,\n- Contact information,\n- Demographic information, and\n- Social Security numbers.\nIf you receive a data breach notice from INTEGRIS, you could now be at risk of identity theft—and the devastating financial and legal consequences that go along with it.\nWhat Should You Do if You Receive an INTEGRIS Data Breach Letter?\nINTEGRIS has not yet confirmed a data breach. However, based on the company's recent website notice, a breach of patient information is possible. Individuals who receive a data breach letter from INTEGRIS should take steps to protect themselves. (See our Guide for Victims of Data Breach for more details at\nhttps://www.myinjuryattorney.com/patient-privacy-data-breach-lawyers/if-your-information-has-been-compromised-in-a-data-breach/).\nAdditionally, potential victims should consider contacting a data breach attorney immediately, as anyone who receives a data breach letter from INTEGRIS may be entitled to financial compensation.\nIf you wish to discuss this data security incident, please contact Console & Associates, P.C. at (866) 778-5500.

    "text": "The Cavaliers will be without Isaac Okoro, the team’s best defensive player, when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 20 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nOkoro sustained a right shoulder injury Dec. 16 in the game with the Nets in Brooklyn. An MRI performed Dec. 18 at Cleveland Clinic confirmed a sprain that will keep him sidelined at least two weeks, the team announced. By that timetable he will miss six games and possibly more.\n“Okoro will be re-evaluated in approximately two weeks, following a series of treatment and rehabilitation,” The Cavs said in a news release. “His status and return to basketball activities will be updated as appropriate.”\nThe Cavs host the 76ers on Dec. 21 and the Jazz on Dec. 23 and then head west for three games. They play the Nuggets in Denver on Dec. 27, the Warriors in San Francisco on Dec. 30 and the Lakers in Los Angeles on New Year’s Eve.\nOkoro has played in 23 games with 16 starts for the 23-4 Cavaliers. He is averaging 6.6 points and 21 minutes a game, but more importantly, he is usually tasked with guarding the opponent’s best shooter.\nFortunately for the Cavs, Max Strus is expected to make his 2024-25 debut against the Bucks after missing the first 27 games with an ankle injury.\nThe Bucks started slowly, but have emerged as one of the hottest teams in the NBA. They beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Dec. 17 in Las Vegas to win the NBA Cup. The Bucks, 14-11, have won three straight and eight of their last 10 games.\nThe Cavs have the best record in the NBA. They are 14-1 at the FieldHouse. Their only home loss was to the Atlanta Hawks, 135-124, on Nov. 27.\nBucks at Cavaliers When: 7:30 p.m., Dec. 20\nWhere: Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\nRecords: Bucks 14-11, Cavaliers 23-4\nTV: FanDuel Sports Ohio",

    "title": "February's Flat Shop Sales: Wet Weather, Cost-of-Living Crisis Dampen Consumer Spirits",
    "text": "Shop sales in February experienced zero growth as record wet weather conditions and ongoing cost-of-living pressures kept potential shoppers indoors. Despite a noticeable uptick in clothing sales, this positive trend was counterbalanced by a decline in food and fuel purchases, as outlined by the latest official statistics. This stagnant sales performance in February followed a lackluster December and a subsequent robust recovery in January. While there was a slight relief in food price increases during February, the overall financial burden on consumers remained heavy, influenced by soaring housing costs and fuel prices.\nAdvertisment Impact of Weather and Economic Factors February's dismal retail performance underscores the significant impact of external factors such as weather conditions and the broader economic climate on consumer behavior. Retailers in Wells expressed concerns over an alarming rise in shoplifting incidents, attributing it to the financial desperation felt by many. Additionally, the closure of a key shopping center by the ALB Group, planned for April, highlights the shifting retail landscape, exacerbated by changing shopping habits. This shift is further evidenced by the struggles faced by global economies, notably China, which plays a crucial role in the sales figures of international brands like Ted Baker. Despite these challenges, Ted Baker reassures its customers of continued operations and the fulfillment of orders.\nConsumer Behavior and Retail Strategies Advertisment Recent earnings reports from U.S. retailers reveal a widening gap in the spending patterns of affluent versus less affluent consumers amidst the highest inflation rates seen in four decades. Companies like Dollar General and Dollar Tree have noticed shifts in consumer purchasing behavior, with Dollar Tree experiencing a significant increase in same-store sales. Conversely, Macy's reported increased non-essential spending among middle to higher income groups, bolstering its department store sales. This dichotomy in consumer spending underscores the resilience of certain consumer segments while highlighting the cautious approach adopted by lower-income groups in response to inflationary pressures.\nLooking Ahead: Retail Evolution and Consumer Adaptation The retail sector is at a crossroads, navigating through a complex web of economic uncertainties and evolving consumer preferences. The adaptation to these changes, as seen through the success of discount and dollar stores, points towards a future retail landscape where value and convenience dominate consumer priorities. As major retailers like Walmart and Nordstrom express optimism despite the challenging environment, the sector as a whole must remain agile, continuously adapting to meet the shifting demands of a diverse consumer base. The resilience of the retail sector, amidst fluctuating economic conditions and consumer confidence levels, will likely define the path forward for businesses and shoppers alike.",

    "text": "Margot podría alzarse con su primer Globo de Oro gracias a ‘Barbie’, película que cuenta con 9 nominaciones, entre otras, la de Mejor Actriz. Sale a la luz cuánto ha ganado Margot Robbie con la película de ‘Barbie’ Silvia Vázquez - 28/12/2023, 21:34 El ‘efecto Barbie’ ha llegado a los Globos de Oro 2024 gracias a Margot Robbie. Con un total de 9 nominaciones , la aplaudida película en la que da vida a la muñeca más famosa de la historia parte como la gran favorita de estos galardones y ha convertido a la actriz en una de las invitadas más esperadas de la edición.\nSu aparición sobre la alfombra roja de estos premios, considerados la antesala de los Oscar, no ha defraudado. En línea con la estrategia de lookazos rosas que siguió durante la gira promocional de la cinta por todo el mundo el pasado verano, Margot ha llegado este 7 de enero al Hotel Beverly Hilton de Beverly Hills en Los Ángeles (California) con (rosa)\nLa intérprete se mide esta noche en la categoría de Mejor Actriz de Comedia o Musical con otras grandes de Hollywood, como Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman o Emma Stone. De salir victoriosa, este sería el primer Globo de Oro de Margot Robbie , que ya ha estado nominada en otras tres ocasiones anteriormente pero nunca se ha llevado la estatuilla a casa.\nEl estilo de Margot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2023: la antesala de 'Barbie'\nComo decíamos, esta no es la primera vez que la actriz asiste, deslumbrante, a los Globos de Oro. De hecho, en la pasada edición de 2023 fue una de las invitadas más aclamadas. Pese a que asistía como nominada a Mejor Actriz en una Película Musical o de Comedia por su papel en 'Babylon' , Margot ya nos dejó un aperitivo de lo que nos depararía el año al escoger un vestido rosa que parecía ser un guiño a ‘Barbie’ , cuyas primeras imágenes ya habían salido a la luz en aquel momento aunque todavía quedaban meses para el estreno. En concreto, optó por un vestido de tul de seda con transparencias y aplicaciones de cristales, plumas en la falda y broche joya en el escote , que lleva el sello de Chanel , ‘maison’ con la que mantuvo una prolífica relación durante años.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2023 con vestido de Chanel\n/ Getty Images 2021: postpandemia\nNo es casualidad por tanto que en 2021 la intérprete también confiara en esta casa francesa para pisar la ‘red carpet’ de los Globos de Oro, la última antes de la caída en desgracia de estos galardones que sufrieron el boicot de Hollywood . ¿Su apuesta? Un diseño estampado de la colección primavera-verano 2021 que dejaba los hombros al descubierto y que lució en esta atípica gala , celebrada entre Los Ángeles y Nueva York por razones de seguridad frente al Covid . Como productora principal de la película, Margot presentó el tráiler de la película ‘Promising Young Woman’, nominada en la categoría de Mejor Película de Drama.\nTodos los looks de la alfombra roja de los Globos de Oro 2021 24 fotos\n2020: alianza con Chanel\nDe la misma forma, un año antes Margot Robbie estaba nominada a los Globos de Oro 2020 por su papel en la película ‘Bombshell’ a Mejor Actriz de Reparto y brilló gracias a un look de colección de Alta Costura de 2019 de Chanel creado por Virginie Viard, con cuerpo de lentejuelas y falda tubo blanca.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2020 con look de Alta Costura de Chanel\n/ Getty Images 2018: primera nominación\nEn la histórica edición de 2018 que tiñó de negro la alfombra roja en respuesta al caso Weinstein, Margot se decantó por un vestido de Gucci con hombros estructurados y escote de infarto en el que destacan los bordados metalizados a modo de lazo y flores. Aquella fue la primera vez que acudía como nominada, concretamente en la categoría de Mejor Actriz Protagonista en Película Cómica o Musical por la cinta ‘I, Tonya’ , con la que además debutó como productora.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2018 con vestido de Gucci\n/ Getty Images 2015: su debut en los Globos de Oro\nNoticias relacionadas La escena de 'Barbie' que Greta Gerwig se negó a cortar a pesar de las presiones: \"Es el corazón de la película\" ¿Quién es Tom Ackerley, el discreto y atractivo marido de Margot Robbie? Para remontarnos a la primera vez que Margot estuvo en los Globos de Oro tenemos que retroceder hasta 2015. Su carrera había despegado poco antes gracias a su participación en ‘El lobo de Wall Street’ junto a Leonardo diCaprio, por lo que era de una de las primeras ‘red carpets’ importantes a las que asistía. Para la ocasión eligió un vestido columna de Gucci, en color marfil, con aplicaciones de pedrería y una abertura de infarto que le cedía protagonismo a sus zapatos ‘peep-toe’ en verde esmeralda.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2015 con vestido de Gucci\n/ Getty Images",

    "text": "En las próximas horas un tren de tormentas solares llegará a la Tierra, avisan los expertos en tiempo espacial\nLa actividad magnética solar continúa aumentando. En los últimos días se han producido erupciones y hay CME en dirección a nuestro planeta. Se espera un verdadero tren de tormentas solares.\nLo sabemos bien, el máximo del ciclo solar está cada vez más cerca. De hecho, se espera para finales de este año y nuestra estrella nos proporciona pruebas continuas de ello.\nDe hecho, hace unos días las regiones activas AR3663 y AR3664 iluminaron el Sol con numerosas llamaradas, algunas también asociadas a eyecciones de masa coronal (CME). La primera, AR3663, está situada en el hemisferio norte del Sol y pronto se pondrá; la segunda está situada en el hemisferio sur, más o menos en el centro del disco solar.\nHa sido una semana realmente emocionante para el Sol\nSe han observado llamaradas incluso de clase X, las más enérgicas. Las erupciones solaes se clasifican en cinco escalas de potencia. En orden creciente de potencia son A, B, C, M y X, y cada clase es diez veces más poderosa que la anterior. Por ejemplo, la clase X alcanza el increíble caudal de 10-4 W/m² y las incidencias pueden ser notables en la Tierra, ahora las repasaremos.\nDurante este fin de semana la Tierra será alcanzada por el viento solar producido por estos fenómenos y la interacción del viento solar con nuestra magnetosfera traerá una serie de tormentas geomagnéticas, incluso de intensidad \"grave\" según el departamento de tiempo espacial de la NOAA.\nTambién, en lo que respecta a las tormentas geomagnéticas, existe una clasificación en función de su intensidad que contiene 5 clases. Las menos intensas pertenecen a la clase G1, mientras que las más intensas pertenecen a la clase G5.\nTal y como hemos mencionado, la NOAA ha avisado de una tormenta geomagnética G4 para el día de mañana, que podría provocar problemas generalizados en el control del voltaje. De hecho, se avisa de que algunos sistema de protección serán desconectados para evitar errores en la red.\nTambién advierte de problemas de seguimiento en naves espaciales y carga, que podrían derivar en problemas de orientación. La navegación por satélite podría verse afectada durante horas.\nLa NOAA es una agencia científica y reguladora de EE. UU. que se ocupa de la previsión meteorológica, el seguimiento de las condiciones oceánicas y atmosféricas, pero va más allá. La agencia también participa en el campo de los programas de satélites meteorológicos, los estudios climáticos e incluso la meteorología espacial.\nEl Sol seguirá dando espectáculo: auroras incluso en latitudes más bajas de lo habitual\nDurante un ciclo solar, que sabemos que tiene una duración media de aproximadamente 11 años, se producen aproximadamente 200 tormentas de clase G3, 100 tormentas de clase G4 y sólo 4 tormentas de clase G5 .\nPor tanto, no son fenómenos muy frecuentes y, además de provocar la formación de auroras incluso en latitudes más bajas de lo normal, también pueden provocar numerosas perturbaciones tanto para los satélites que orbitan alrededor de nuestro planeta como para las infraestructuras presentes en la superficie.\nDe hecho, tal y como avisa la NOAA, una tormenta geomagnética de clase G4 puede provocar interrupciones en las comunicaciones con posibles apagones de radio, e incluso puede causar daños en las líneas eléctricas. También podría dejar fuera de servicio a los satélites, que ahora son muy importantes para diversas tecnologías que también utilizamos habitualmente. en la tierra.\nPor lo tanto, sólo tenemos que esperar a que pase este tren de perturbaciones espaciales, esperando que los problemas sean pequeños y sólo transitorios.",

    "text": "Celebs\nPretty Little Baby singer Connie Francis hospitalised amid orthopedic struggles\nIconic singer Connie Francis, 87, who was famous for her hit song Pretty Little Baby, was hospitalised in Florida on Wednesday, July 2, after suffering from “extreme pain”. The development was first reported by an entertainment publication, which quoted sources saying she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.\nWhy is Connie Francis hospitalised?\nConnie herself subsequently confirmed her hospitalisation through a Facebook message, saying she was being given “tests and checks to identify the cause(s) of the extreme pain”. She also confirmed this medical setback caused her to pull out of an appearance at Brucie’s Independence Day concert, having already cancelled an appearance a few weeks earlier following hip treatment.\nAlthough the specific cause of her ICU stay was not immediately apparent, sources close to her family informed the publication that Connie has struggled with orthopedic problems over the last several years. She wrote on Facebook in March this year that she was employing a wheelchair to try and take pressure off a “bothersome painful hip” until stem cell therapy could be done.\nOnly a few hours after she had made her first announcement, Connie gave an update to her followers, stating she had been transferred from the ICU to a private room after a series of tests and scans. She thanked her followers for their support, “Thank you all for your kind thoughts, words and prayers. They mean so much!”\nConnie has a known history of serious health issues. Apart from her constant hip problems which resulted in her 2018 retirement, she endured a seven-year loss of voice following nasal surgery in the 1970s and various hospitalisations following a misdiagnosed mental illness. A 1974 knifepoint–rape led to PTSD and depression, culminating in a 1984 suicide attempt and involuntary psychiatric commitments. The murder of her brother by mob gunmen and a miscarriage further impacted her mental wellbeing.\nDespite these personal struggles, Connie recently found renewed fame when her 1962 B-side Pretty Little Baby went viral on TikTok and then Instagram in 2025, accumulating billions of views and topping various viral charts.\nFor more updates, join/follow our WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube channels.",

    "text": "2023 was a colossal year for games, both AAA and indie. You had games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Resident Evil 4 Remake prove a lot for their respective audiences, and games like Sea of Stars and Dredge showed that indie devs can truly stand toe to toe with larger budgets. With all that being said, the massive influx of games has left a lot of games unnoticed yet still well deserving of attention. Here are 2023’s best video game hidden gems, in no particular order. The Best Hidden Gem Games in 2023 Deliver Us Mars Deliver Us the Moon brought an enjoyable sci-fi thriller that equaled in both stakes and heart and was a beloved indie gem when I first played it. As such, Deliver Us Mars followed up on that excellently with a game designed for fans and newcomers alike. With a properly voiced protagonist, the new setting of Mars, and even better visuals, this was generally considered a nice upgrade over the first game. It was even free on the Epic Games Store previously if you managed to catch it. Available On: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S. Everspace 2 I tried Everspace 2 way back when it was released in early access years ago, and even then it set a gold standard for space combat flight games like it. If it weren’t for getting caught up in a handful of other games this year, I probably would’ve checked it out again already. If you’re a big fan of beautiful space exploration and some stellar, in-depth combat systems, you’d be doing yourself a favor by giving it a look. Available On: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S. Viewfinder Are you a big fan of puzzle games that center around a unique mechanic not seen in other games (think Subliminal or Cocoon)? Then Viewfinder should be right up your alley. This game is all about taking and manipulating photos to drop them into reality, using their unique terrain and contents to solve increasingly complex puzzles. It’s as much a visual treat as it is easy enjoyment. Available On: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5. Venba While games are mostly centered around farming as much fun for the player as possible, games like Venba instead teleport you into another culture that, while offering fun, is more focused on its unique story and background. Venba does just that, but looks through the lens of a family of Indian immigrants as they live in and adjust to a new place across the perspective of numerous traditional meals. It’s very short, but its impact is felt well beyond the credits. Available On: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch. 30XX Were you a big fan of the classic Mega Man games, or simply like 2D action platformers? Then 30XX and its prequel 20XX will be right up your alley. This action roguelike sees you (and possibly a friend) explore wacky mechanical locations in a power suit that eerily feels like it’s asking for a lawsuit. That aside, the game is very fun and has everything you could ask for from a Mega Man spiritual successor. Available On: PC, Nintendo Switch. Under the Waves While not developed by them, Under the Waves has a unique perspective in that the people behind games like Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human helped publish the game. The game tells the story of a man struggling with loss on an extended deep sea dive, who begins to experience unexplainable phenomena. It’s a solid mystery, and one many have said is worth exploring. Available On: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S. El Paso, Elsewhere A motel, endless supernatural monstrosities, and one man with the goal to stop the end of the world. That’s really all the context I can give for the story without spoiling the surprise inside. Where El Paso, Elsewhere lacks in consistently fresh combat encounters (albeit wearing its influences on its sleeve), it thrives in telling a unique story that almost no other game has dared to explore. As someone who’s experienced a few instances of it with far less dramatization, it was surprising and a little hard to watch at times. Available On: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S. Planet of Lana While this list is made with no hidden gem standing tall above the rest, Planet of Lana is my personal largest GOTY snuff. It has everything a great adventure game should have, with plenty of heartfelt moments, absolutely gorgeous art, great music, and some solid puzzle design to boot. As the first game from its indie studio Wishfully, it’s an artistic achievement that I truly hope more people play. Available On: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch. SteamWorld Build Are you interested in city builders but always find them a touch too complex for your tastes? Well if the demo for SteamWorld Build is anything to go off of, it seems like it has complexity, but never enough to feel too overwhelming. I’ve never adored the genre myself, and this is one that I seriously want to get into when I have the patience for longer games again (that longer RPG fatigue’s been getting to me lately). It even has some gorgeous art, so you shouldn’t be left disappointed. Available On: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch. Blood West Last but certainly not least is a game I’m doing a playthrough of while writing this article. This indie stealth gem left Early Access a few weeks ago, and the amount of care and love put into its stealth systems is a true treat. Not just through its rewarding stealth (and even loud) combat, but through its impeccable atmosphere as well. The sound design is truly next level, and up there with some of the greats. It’s even got Stephen Russell voicing the main protagonist, who you may know from the earlier Thief games and as Corvo in Dishonored 2.
