    "text": "Tensión entre Fuerzas Militares y Autodefensas en Guachaca, Magdalena Los residentes solicitan a las autoridades una pronta solución para restablecer la paz en la zona y aliviar la tensión que viven. En la madrugada del jueves 28 de diciembre se registró un incidente en el corregimiento de Guachaca, donde se alega que un grupo de Comandos Junglas intentó enfrentarse, presuntamente desde helicópteros, con las Autodefensas Conquistadoras de la Sierra Nevada (ACSN). Este episodio generó tensión en las comunidades circundantes y dejó daños en varias viviendas, según evidencian fotografías disponibles. Las ACSN respondieron a través de un video, reiterando su compromiso con la paz total. No obstante, expresaron su oposición a la incursión de la fuerza pública en sus territorios, especialmente cuando estas acciones afectan a la población civil. La organización subrayó su disposición a defenderse y confrontar a las autoridades en caso de persistir en sus visitas. Las comunidades, como la vereda Los Cocos, se manifestaron afectadas por el intento de enfrentamiento, destacando daños en propiedades y un sentimiento generalizado de temor. Los residentes solicitan a las autoridades una pronta solución para restablecer la paz en la zona y aliviar la tensión que viven. En respuesta a la situación, las ACSN enviaron un mensaje al Gobierno Nacional reafirmando su compromiso con la paz. No obstante, advirtieron que, de repetirse la visita de la fuerza pública a sus territorios, se verían obligadas a una confrontación directa. La comunidad sigue atenta a las acciones y declaraciones de ambas partes en busca de una solución pacífica a este conflicto.",

    "text": "A Jewish New Yorker who survived the Hamas attack at the Nova Music Festival has reunited with the man who saved her life. Natalie Sanandaji, 28, returned to Israel for the first time since the harrowing October 7 massacre and met Israeli hero Moshe Sati, who, alongside his son, rescued more than 100 festival-goers, including herself, by driving into the terrorist attack multiple times, transporting them to safety. In the touching reunion filmed by CNN , the two embrace each other while Sati can be seen tearing up. Sanandaji, who only recently learned Sati's name, expressed deep gratitude, describing him as one of the kindest souls she has ever met. Despite Sati's modesty and reluctance for recognition, Sanandaji considers herself fortunate for his selfless actions, emphasizing that he is known in his hometown for always helping others without hesitation. Natalie Sanandaji, 28, returned to Israel for the first time since the harrowing October 7 massacre and met hero Moshe Sati, who saved her life Israeli hero Moshe Sati, who, alongside his son, rescued more than 100 festival-goers by driving into the terrorist attack multiple times, transporting them to safety In the touching reunion filmed by CNN , the two embrace each other while Sati can be seen tearing up Sati's son, an observant Jew who celebrates the Sabbath - meaning, he cannot drive or work on Saturday, joined his father in the rescue mission despite these limitations. Sanandaji recounted the emotional reunion, capturing the genuine bond formed between them due to the shared trauma. She said Sati's acts of heroism went beyond expectations. Despite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States. She voiced concerns over the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the US, particularly in her hometown of New York, citing various acts of hate targeting the Jewish community. Sanandaji ran for her life while getting gunned down by terrorists on October 7, ultimately surviving the horrific massacre. Although she made it out alive and returned to her home in Long Island a week later, she said she does not feel any safer back in the US. On October 7, she and three friends were camping overnight at the Supernova Sukkot Gathering near Re'im, an event billed as a night of 'friends, love and infinite freedom' to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot with electronic music. On the first evening, nothing was out of the ordinary. But moments before dawn broke on Saturday, explosions appeared in the sky. 'We were woken up by one of our friends who came to tell us some rockets had been sent over.’ For many of her friends, this is normal. ‘But this is not something that I am used to seeing.' In October, Sanandaji told DailyMail.com many were still in the crowd dancing when the first salvoes of rockets passed overhead. For a time, it was not clear what was happening. Some festival-goers were seen walking away from the disruption. Others carried on, unaware. Despite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States 'Many people who were in the crowd had told me that they thought the noises were coming from the music,' Natalie said. 'After a few minutes, we started to realize that the rockets just kept coming and kept coming and kept coming. Though first time I really realized how severe the situation was becoming was when they shut off the music.' Security guards reacted quickly, at first telling guests to get down and cover their faces. As the missiles closed in, they told guests to pack what they could and evacuate as soon as possible. 'They were there until the end,' Natalie explained. 'Most of them had died, guiding us and trying to get us to safety.' 'Everybody started driving in one direction. There was traffic from so many cars being in such a confined space all trying to leave at the same time. 'Even at that point, in my head I was thinking, \"OK, if it's just rockets, if they're not in our vicinity, we have the Iron Dome. Some scrap from intercepted rockets could hit our cars. But we'll be in our cars. We'll be okay. We'll get out of here. It might take a few hours because there's so many people, but we'll be fine.\" 'When we started driving in one direction, security started telling people to drive in another direction. That's when we realized that there must be something else going on other than just the rockets. 'Security started yelling at everybody \"get out of your cars,\" \"park your cars on the side of the dirt road and run!\" 'I didn't understand why at first... and then we heard the first gunshots.' Within moments, gunmen had entered the festival on motorbikes, in vans and by motorized paraglider and started shooting at the event's 3,500 attendees with Kalashnikov assault rifles. At least 260 people died in the massacre, with many victims shot in the back as they tried to run. Countless were injured, and many more taken back into Gaza as hostages. Natalie only knew that she had to keep moving. 'The security told us to pull over to the side of the road: \"Being in the cars is making you too easy of a target - get out of your car and start running.\" Natalie Sanandaji escaped the massacre with a group of friends on Saturday, October 7, 2023 \"These are the only photos I have from the festival. Obviously didn't have much time to take any other photos or videos since we were running for our lives.\" - Natalie Sanandaji, 28 Destroyed cars and personal items are still left scattered around the festival site, on October 13 'As soon as we heard the first gunshots... I was there with three people, we were in the car together. We opened the doors and we started running for our lives. 'After that we just ran. I remember at a certain point there was a bit of a ditch. And we were contemplating if we should go into the ditch and hide, or if we should keep running. And we kept running. A lot of people that went into the ditch are not here today. Every decision we made ended up saving our lives. But we had... no one had any idea what decision to make. You just had to make a decision in that moment.' 'We ran for about four hours, on and off. In between the gunshots, anytime the gunshots would subdue for a little bit, we would say, \"Okay, we're going to, we're going to walk a little slower, we're going to catch our breath.\" 'The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction - thinking that you're running to safety - and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they're running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting. 'These were innocent children. We had nothing to protect ourselves. Imagine you're in an open field with nowhere to hide and they are coming at you from every direction. 'Kids were running in all different directions and you had to make a split-second decision on where to run, to where you thought it would be safe. 'And that decision would either save your life or get you killed or kidnapped.' The group of four continued to follow the road out of Re'im. Their last instruction from camp security had been to push on to the nearest town. For miles, they walked along the banks of short grassland and fields with little in the way of protection. An Israeli officer walks around a campsite at the festival near Re'im kibbutz on October 17 'The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction - thinking that you're running to safety - and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they're running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting.' Destroyed cars are seen at the party site near the Kibbutz Re'im on Tuesday, October 10, 2023 'The only time we had someone near us to guide us was about two hours in. We saw a police officer and his direction was to go in the direction of the sun. That was the direction the town was in.' The police officer walked with Natalie and her group for a while, armed only with a handgun. He explained he could not call for backup because Hamas had taken over the nearby police station. Over the radio, 'you could hear the terrorists yelling'. They could only keep moving. 'There was just an exodus of hundreds and hundreds of kids walking in the same direction. And then every time we heard gunshots, some people ran this way, some people ran that way. 'You're in an open field and there's almost nowhere to hide. It felt hopeless. It really felt hopeless. There's just simply nowhere to hide, there was nowhere to go. There's stories of some people that hid in drains, in trees and fields. A lot of those people... they ended up finding them and killing most of them. 'The ones that survived were the ones that hid under the dead bodies and pretended to be dead.' Exhausted, Natalie's group eventually stopped to rest in the shade of a tree. Four hours had passed and they were still miles from the nearest town, an endless journey with no way to know how far they had gone. As they paused, they saw a large white van coming towards them. 'At first we thought it might be a terrorist so we fought to get up and run... but then we realised, \"where would we run to? What would we do?\"' The group could only wait by the side of the road. The vehicle pulled up and a man got out. He offered them a lift. They still had an hour to go. Vehicles were abandoned after security guards told attendees to leave their cars and run Fleeing for their lives, people had no time to react when told the abandon their cars and run. Pictured: car keys are left in the ignition of a destroyed car at the festival on October 12 Charred and damaged cars along a desert road after an attack by Hamas militants at the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel on Saturday, October 7 'The people that risked their own lives to try to save us was incredible to see. I couldn't believe that these people were going out of their way to risk their lives to save all of us. If that man didn't come with his car, I don't think I would be here today. 'It's very hard for me to comprehend these stories that I am seeing now, every day, someone else that was kidnapped, that their friends and family had a little bit of hope that maybe they are still alive. Every day people are posting that they have been found dead.' Natalie and her friends were fortunate to escape to Patish, a nearby moshav. There, she says the town came together to help those still flooding in. 'They gave us food. They gave us shelter. We hid in their bomb shelters.' She described the horror parents were undergoing all the while as they acted quickly to take in more children. 'When the rockets started going off, all the children there were messaging their parents, telling them what was happening. To tell them that they were safe and trying to escape. 'Many people, after a while, couldn't get in touch with their kids anymore. Either their kids were kidnapped or killed. So a lot of people in the town were receiving lists of names of people that were at the festival that... weren't answering their family and friends anymore. 'And they were walking around reading off lists of names hoping that maybe somebody was saved and maybe somebody was in the shelter and then they could inform their families that they are okay.' Natalie managed to get in touch with her mother, who lives in New York. 'I honestly did not tell my mom where I was until after I got home safe because I couldn't stand the idea of her worrying about me about my life that way.' Soon after, Natalie made plans to return home, coming home via Athens. There, she contacted the press, feeling she needed to share her story. She said there is now nowhere she feels entirely safe, amid heightened reports of antisemitism globally. Anti-Jewish threats on Telegram surged 488 percent in the first 18 hours after Hamas' incursion, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The first four days of the conflict also saw anti-Semitic incidents in the United Kingdom surge by more than 300 percent, according to Community Security Trust. 'I have a lot of friends in New York right now who are afraid to leave their homes,' Natalie said. 'I had a friend who tried to call an Uber and the Uber driver messaged her and asked her, \"Are you Jewish?\" And then said, \"If you are, I will kill you.\" 'It doesn't feel safe to be anywhere right now. The fact that I'm not in Israel doesn't make me feel safe. 'I'm incredibly scared for what's to come. Because everything that has happened so far is not the end it is only going to get worse and that's what scares me the most.' In spite of all she has gone through, Natalie's message to the world is to avoid the conflict descending into further unnecessary factional violence. She says she wants people to 'understand that we have the same common enemy' in Hamas, as distinct from the Palestinian people. '[Hamas] is a terrorist organization that does not care though about the lives of Palestinian people, or any people,' she said. 'We have to come together against this common enemy.' 'I am seeing a lot of support online from a lot of countries, from a lot of governments, from a lot of people I know personally, from people I don't know personally. But I think there is still a lot of confusion as to who Hamas is, what they are doing. 'Especially as an Iranian Jew, just a year ago the Iranian government was killing innocent children in their own streets. And I feel that a lot of Iranians even don't realize that we are fighting against the same people. We need to come together and realize that we have the same common enemy.' 'I also want people to understand the fear that Jews are feeling all over the world, whether it's in London or Paris, or New York, or Israel. 'The things that I'm seeing that are happening in New York - I don't actually feel safe going home,' she said. 'Everyone keeps telling me \"it's so great that you're almost back in New York, you're almost home\". But I don't feel safe going back to New York. 'And that's the scariest part. That's the saddest part - that I don't feel safe.'",

    "title": "Lücken im Beet füllen: Mit diesen 8 Stauden geht es schnell - Utopia.de",
    "text": "Manche Pflanzen verlangen Gärtner:innen einiges an Geduld ab. Mit schnellwachsenden Stauden dagegen kannst du deinen Garten unkompliziert verschönern und siehst schon bald Ergebnisse. Wir stellen dir acht davon vor.\nOrange unterstrichene oder mit ** markierte Links sind Partnerlinks. Wenn du darüber bestellst, erhalten wir einen kleinen Anteil vom Verkaufserlös.\nMehr Infos.\nEinige Zierpflanzen für den Garten legen ein eher gemütliches Wachstum an den Tag. Dazu gehören zum Beispiel Heckenpflanzen wie die Konifere oder der Kirschlorbeer, aber auch Stauden wie der Haselwurz oder die Glockenblume. Wenn du unbepflanzte Stellen im Garten möglichst schnell zum Blühen bringen möchtest, solltest du deshalb bei der Wahl der Pflanzen ein Auge auf ihre Wuchsgeschwindigkeit haben.\nIn dieser Übersicht stellen wir dir acht schnellwachsende Stauden vor, die in kurzer Zeit keimen und oft schon nach einigen Wochen Blüten tragen. Alle Gewächse sind übrigens nicht nur schön anzusehen, sondern bieten auch Nahrung für Bienen, Schmetterlinge oder andere Insekten. Wenn du einen insektenfreundlichen Garten planst, eignen sie sich also gut als Ergänzung.\nUtopia empfiehlt: Kaufe wenn möglich Bio-Saatgut, online zum Beispiel erhältlich bei Bloomling, Saat & Gut oder Amazon.\n1) Katzenminze: Schnellwachsende Staude für Wildbienen\nDie Katzenminze ist eine schnellwachsende Staude mit silbergrünen Blättern und violetten, blauen, weißen oder rosa Blüten. Unabhängig von der Farbe verströmen die Blüten einen intensiven Duft, der besonders auf Katzen eine starke Anziehungskraft ausübt – daher der Name. Die Pflanze lockt aber auch Wildbienen und andere Insekten an.\nDu kannst du Katzenminze wahlweise im Frühjahr oder im Herbst pflanzen. Nach etwa zwei Wochen beginnt sie bereits zu keimen. Ihre volle Höhe (bis zu 1,40 Meter) erreicht sie innerhalb eines Jahres.\n- Blütezeit: Ende April bis Anfang Juli\n- Standort: sonnig\n- Boden: sandig, karg bis nährstoffreich, gut durchlässig\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: Katzenminze: Anbau, Pflege und wie sie auf Katzen wirkt\n2) Salbei: Küchenkraut als schnellwachsende Staude\nSalbei ist als Heil- und Küchenkraut beliebt, bietet aber zur Blütezeit auch einen schönen Anblick im Garten. Die schnellwachsende Staude bildet je nach Sorte weiße, violette oder rosafarbene Blüten aus. Im Freiland säst du sie am besten im Mai, wenn keine Nachtfröste mehr zu erwarten sind. Salbei keimt schon zwei Wochen nach der Aussaat und wird für gewöhnlich 30 bis 50 Zentimeter hoch.\n- Blütezeit: Mai bis September (je nach Sorte)\n- Standort: warm und sonnig\n- Boden: durchlässig, nicht zu stickstoffreich\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: Salbei anpflanzen und pflegen – im Garten oder im Topf\n3) Mädchenauge\nDas Mädchenauge ist für seine leuchtend gelben Blüten und die üppigen, buschig angeordneten Blütenblätter bekannt. Diese schnellwachsende Staude keimt oft schon zwei bis drei Wochen nach der Aussaat. Das Saatgut solltest du im März oder April ausbringen.\nAchtung: Wenn du Wert auf bienenfreundliche Stauden legst, solltest du bei der Sortenwahl aufpassen. Die meisten Sorten des Mädchenauges bieten zwar Nahrung für Bienen, es gibt aber auch speziell gezüchtete Sorten, die halbgefüllte oder gefüllte Blüte haben und so Insekten eher keinen Nutzen bringen. Dazu zählt etwa die Sorte „Sunray“.\n- Blütezeit: Juni bis Oktober\n- Standort: warm und vollsonnig\n- Boden: locker, gut durchlässig, viel Humus\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: Mädchenauge: Pflanzen, pflegen und vermehren\n4) Storchschnabel\nViele Storchschnabel-Arten sind für ihr schnelles Wachstum bekannt, so etwa der Balkan-Storchschnabel, der Cambridge-Storchschnabel oder der Knotige Storchschnabel. Es gibt allerdings auch einige langsamer wachsende Sorten, wie beispielsweise den Böhmischen Storchschnabel. Wenn du eine schnellwachsende Staude suchst, solltest du dich also im Vorfeld am besten informieren oder beraten lassen.\n- Blütezeit: meist Mai bis August (einige Sorten blühen bis in den Herbst)\n- Standort: sonnig bis halbschattig (je nach Sorte)\n-\nBoden: gut durchlässig, nährstoffreich, viel\nHumus\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: Storchschnabel: Tipps zu Anbau, Pflege und Standort\n5) Taglilie: Langlebige und schnellwachsende Staude\nTaglilien sind nicht nur schnellwachsende Stauden, sondern auch mehrjährig. Einmal angepflanzt, können sie bei richtiger Pflege bis zu zehn Jahre am selben Standort überdauern. Die Samen keimen innerhalb von zwei bis drei Wochen und bilden schon im ersten Jahr auffällig geformte, orangerote bis gelbe Blüten aus.\nDie beste Zeit für die Aussaat ist der März. Du kannst die Taglilie zwar auch im Herbst säen, aber aufgrund der kälteren Bodentemperatur kann die Keimung dann länger dauern.\n- Blütezeit: meist Mai bis August (einige Sorten blühen bis in den Herbst)\n- Standort: sonnig bis halbschattig\n-\nBoden: gut durchlässig, sehr nährstoffreich, nutze\n[Kompost](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/6-vorteile-vom-kompost-die-du-noch-nicht-kanntest/)\nTaglilien sehen übrigens nicht nur schön aus, sondern sind auch in der Küche verwertbar. Mehr dazu hier: [Taglilien sind essbar: So gibt es frische Blüten aus dem Garten](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/taglilien-sind-essbar-so-gibt-es-frische-blueten-aus-dem-garten_524800/)\n6) Prachtkerze\nAuch wenn es zwei bis fünf Jahre dauern kann, bis sie ihre maximale Höhe erreicht, wächst die Prachtkerze vergleichsweise schnell und buschig und bildet filigrane weißrosa Blüten. Nach der Aussaat beginnt sie nach einer Zeit von 20 bis 60 Tagen zu keimen. Indem du sie im Frühjahr düngst und im Herbst zurückschneidest, kannst du ihr Wachstum zusätzlich anregen.\nDie Prachtkerze ist eine mehrjährige Pflanze und wird bis zu eineinhalb Meter hoch. Sie gilt außerdem als [Dauerblüher](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/dauerblueher-diese-pflanzen-bluehen-monatelang_179103/).\n- Blütezeit: Juni bis Oktober\n- Standort: sonnig, windgeschützt\n- Boden: gut durchlässig, trocken, nährstoffreich\nÜbrigens: Die Prachtkerze stammt ursprünglich aus den Prärien Nordamerikas. Deshalb ist sie im Gartenfachhandel manchmal auch unter dem Namen „Präriekerze“ erhältlich.\n7) Goldmelisse\nDie Goldmelisse (auch: wilde Bergamotte) ist wie viele Pflanzen auf dieser Liste mehrjährig. Schon im ersten Jahr kann sie einen üppigen Blütenteppich bilden und wird deshalb zu den schnellwachsenden Stauden gezählt. Aufgrund von Ausläufern kann sie sich in kurzer Zeit vermehren und ausbreiten. Besonders gut wächst sie, wenn du sie im Frühjahr anpflanzt, am besten im Mai nach den [Eisheiligen](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/eisheilige-2025-sollte-man-mit-dem-einpflanzen-wirklich-noch-warten-v1_124811/). Ihre Blüten sind quirlförmig und scharlachrot gefärbt.\n- Blütezeit: Juni bis September\n- Standort: sonnig bis halbschattig\n- Boden: durchlässig, nährstoffreich, feucht\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: [Goldmelisse: Wie du die wilde Bergamotte pflanzt und verwendest](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/goldmelisse-wie-du-die-wilde-bergamotte-pflanzt-und-verwendest_204387/)\n8) Kokardenblume: Schöne Blüten der schnellwachsenden Staude\nKonkardenblumen sind wegen ihres bunten Äußeren auch als „Malerblumen“ oder „Papageienblumen“ bekannt. Die Blüten sind fein gefiedert und haben kräftige Rot- und Gelbtöne.\nWeil die Konkardenblume zu den schnellwachsenden Stauden gehört, kannst du schon nach kurzer Wartezeit in den Genuss ihrer Farbenpracht kommen. Die Keimdauer beträgt nur ein bis zwei Wochen. Aussäen kannst du sie im Freiland ab Ende April. Wenn du sichergehen willst, dass keine Nachtfröste mehr auftreten, wartest du besser bis Mitte Mai.\n- Blütezeit: Juni bis Oktober\n- Standort: sonnig, windgeschützt\n- Boden: locker, nährstoffreich, viel Humus, kein Lehm\nMehr zu Pflanzung und Pflege: [Kokardenblume: So pflanzt und pflegst du sie](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/kokardenblume-so-pflanzt-und-pflegst-du-sie_186978/)\nÜbrigens: Es gibt neben den schnellwachsenden Stauden auch viele Arten mit weiteren nützlichen Eigenschaften. Wähle beispielsweise [langblühende Stauden](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/langbluehende-stauden-insektenfreundlich-und-bunt_258612/), [Stauden die Trockenheit überstehen](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/6-stauden-die-trockenheit-gut-ueberstehen-v3_802765/) oder Exemplare, die [winterhart](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/winterharte-stauden-diese-5-gewaechse-ueberstehen-den-winter_153030/) sind.\nUtopia empfiehlt: Kaufe wenn möglich [Bio-Saatgut](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/bio-saatgut-gute-gruende-fuer-bio-samen-und-wo-du-sie-kaufen-kannst_104619/), online zum Beispiel erhältlich bei [Bloomling](https://www.bloomling.de/samen/bio-gemuese), [Saat & Gut](https://www.saat-und-gut.de/bio/) oder [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/stores/Loveplants-BioSaatgut/page/86A5B7AD-41CA-4CB4-86C7-D317ABE5E7E8?tag=utopia012-21).\n[Mehr Infos](https://utopia.de/partner-links-faq/).",

Credit: Getty Images\nBut this combination of factors has led to an acute shortage of HRT patches which, as we report today, serves to highlight the wider problem in Australia with medicine supply.\nThere are about 420 medicines listed on the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Medicine Shortage Reports Database. The TGA receives an average of 120 notifications of new medicine shortages a month, with 12 of these having a critical impact rating.\nIn addition to HRT patches, other medications experiencing shortages are blood thinners, antibiotics and ADHD medication. The affected patient groups are often some of Australia’s most vulnerable.\nThe reasons why Australia experiences shortages are varied and complex but stem from our reliance on overseas suppliers as we import about 90 per cent of our medicines. As a consequence, we are extremely vulnerable to supply chain issues, such as the disruption that can be caused by natural disasters and our sheer geographic distance from manufacturers.\nAs one drug’s availability decreases, it increases demand on alternatives and so stresses another supply chain. Our small population limits our bargaining power to negotiate with overseas suppliers, and our existing local manufacturing capabilities hamper our ability to respond quickly at a domestic level to shortages.\nThis was in evidence last week with the shortage of diabetes drug Ozempic, also used as a weight-loss tool. Patients had been turning to replica weight-loss alternatives compounded by local pharmacists – but the government is banning those local versions from October over safety and regulation concerns, in a move backed by the TGA.\nAdvertisement While no one can argue that patient health and safety should be compromised, the need to address these issues – especially our local manufacturing capabilities – is clear.\nLoading Our medication supply issues were especially pronounced during COVID, but medical industry figures warn that the problem is getting worse.\nThe federal government has taken some steps towards addressing our onshore healthcare manufacturing capabilities through its Future Made in Australia package, which includes investment in locally produced medicines and extra money for the National Medical Stockpile.\nBut the Royal Australasian College of Physicians wants to see that bolstered with a number of other urgent actions to alleviate the problems.\nThese solutions include creating a list of “critical, life-sustaining medications” to be developed, and minimum stock levels of those to be maintained, along with better tracking of stock levels.\nThe physicians’ peak body also wants the TGA to incentivise international suppliers of medicines to enter and remain in our market and for manufacturers to give the TGA advance notice of shortages and changes in supply.\nAs RACP president Professor Jennifer Martin warns, there is a major vulnerability in our healthcare system. “In addition to putting patients at risk of poorer clinical outcomes, medication shortages and discontinuations cause a great deal of anxiety for patients,” Professor Martin said.\n“Serious concerns over health and quality of life are then left to our already overburdened physicians to manage.”\nThe Sun-Herald urges the federal government to heed these calls to ensure our most vulnerable are not paying the price for a systemic problem. As is summarised in our report today – at best, medicine shortages are inconvenient. At worst, they can be very dangerous.\nBevan Shields sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week.
