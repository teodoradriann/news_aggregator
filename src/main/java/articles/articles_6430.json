    "text": "Con la puesta en marcha de una planta de biomasa en su fábrica de Alovera (Guadalajara), la compañía de bebidas lidera el proceso de transformación de la industria cervecera hacia un modelo más sostenible.\nMahou San Miguel, compañía de bebidas de capital familiar 100% español y líder del sector cervecero de nuestro país, avanza en su hoja de ruta de descarbonización con un ambicioso proyecto que le llevará a reducir un 95% las emisiones directas de CO2 de su centro de Alovera (Guadalajara), la fábrica de cerveza más grande de España y en el top 3 a nivel europeo en términos de producción.\nLa puesta en marcha de una planta de biomasa en estas instalaciones, prevista para el primer trimestre de 2026, permitirá a la compañía seguir avanzando en su objetivo de alcanzar la neutralidad en carbono en todos sus centros para 2030, recogido en su Plan de Sostenibilidad “Vamos 2030”.\nCon una inversión estimada de más de 15 millones euros el proyecto será ejecutado y operado por Magnon Servicios Energéticos, filial del grupo Ence, que asumirá también el suministro de la energía térmica en forma de agua sobrecalentada y de la biomasa con certificación SURE, que acredita el abastecimiento y producción sostenible de la misma. La previsión de ambas compañías es iniciar los trabajos de ejecución en el primer trimestre de 2025 para que la instalación esté operativa en 2026.\nComo principal compañía del sector en nuestro país, Mahou San Miguel continúa así promoviendo iniciativas que le permiten crecer de manera responsable y liderar el proceso de transformación futura de la industria cervecera en su necesaria evolución hacia modelos productivos más sostenibles.\nDe hecho, esta planta de biomasa es una de las 19 iniciativas incluidas en la primera línea de ayudas concedidas por el Ministerio de Industria y Turismo, en el marco del Proyecto Estratégico para la Recuperación y Transformación Económica (PERTE) de descarbonización industrial de nuestro país, que permitirá reducir 551.000 millones de toneladas de CO2 al año.\nCon ocho centros de producción en España y cuatro manantiales de agua mineral natural, Mahou San Miguel es la compañía con la huella industrial más grande del sector y con mayor cobertura geográfica a nivel nacional, lo que le permite generar un euro de impacto económico por cada tres botellas que elabora en nuestro país y generar más de 147.000 empleos indirectos a través de su actividad.\nSolo el año pasado, la compañía incrementó en un 34% la inversión en sus activos industriales para mantener sus instalaciones a la cabeza en materia de innovación, sostenibilidad y excelencia operacional, al tiempo que impulsó su rol como empleador y motor de desarrollo local.\nDentro de su mapa de operaciones la fábrica de Alovera juega un papel clave por su dimensión y relevancia, siendo punta de lanza en muchos aspectos. Entre otros, por su óptimo comportamiento ambiental y el uso de tecnologías innovadoras y prácticas ecoeficientes que la compañía irá extendiendo al resto de centros de producción de la compañía para cumplir con su objetivo de alcanzar la neutralidad en carbono.\nEl centro cuenta con un parque solar fotovoltaico para autoconsumo con una potencia instalada de 4,3 MW pico y utiliza energía eléctrica 100% renovable. Además, el 15% de la energía térmica empleada en su producción ya es autogenerada y, como el resto de las plantas de la compañía, es residuo cero gracias a su valorización y reutilización en otros procesos.\nCon una inversión de 15 millones de euros, la instalación estará operativa en 2026.",

    "title": "20 riot police sent to remove 10 young people praying rosary at abortion clinic in Spain",
    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Dec 28, 2023 / 18:30 pm (CNA).\nThe Government Delegation (public administration) in Madrid mobilized approximately 20 riot police officers to prevent about 10 young people from praying the rosary in front of the Dator abortion clinic.\nOn Dec. 28, the feast of the Holy Innocents, the officers also arrested Dr. Jesús Poveda, who was staging a one-man sit-in at the doors of the Dator clinic.The doctor has spent close to 40 years helping mothers at risk of abortion.\nPoveda was thus faithful to what already constitutes a tradition of the pro-life movement in Spain by carrying out an act of passive resistance on only one day of the year, the feast of the Holy Innocents, while dedicating the remaining 364 to saving babies.\nIn the early hours of Thursday morning, unidentified people affixed posters to the Dator clinic\nwith explicit images of aborted babies with messages such as “He is a holy innocent” and “Are you going to look the other way?”\nAt 9 a.m. sharp, Poveda went to the doors of the abortion center and sat down on the ground in protest near the clinic doors. Shortly after, a group of young people from the\nPraying Is Not a Crime movement arrived at the scene with the intention of meditating on the luminous mysteries of the rosary.\nSeveral police officers automatically made them move a hundred meters (about 330 feet) away from the place, where on their knees and displaying a large wooden cross and an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, they began to pray the rosary.\nNext to them was a woman carrying a sign with the usual message of the 40 Days for Life initiative: “You are not alone, we can help you.”\nPhoto caption and credit: 40 Days for Life volunteer tries to pray for the end of abortion in Madrid in front of the police present. Credit: Nicolás de Cárdenas / ACI Prensa\nSome of the young people explained to ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, that the officers just told them that there was another event scheduled and notice given to the Government Delegation, and that was why they had to move away from the place. Pro-lifers claimed that, according to the law, they did not constitute a demonstration since there were fewer than 20 people in their group.\nWhile this was going on, a group of fewer than 10 feminists came onto the scene with the plan to demonstrate at the site, as they have done regularly for a few years.\nAround the place they displayed posters with slogans such as “keep your rosaries off our ovaries,” “feminist struggle = trans struggle,” and “I too aborted. So what!” while they used a loudspeaker to play music that could be heard all down the street.\nAt about 9:30 in the morning, the officers told Poveda to leave the place near the doors of the abortion clinic, which he refused to do, offering passive resistance. The police then transferred him to a patrol car in which he was taken to the police station.\nThroughout the hour that the pro-life volunteers were at the scene, the police didn’t allow them to freely move about and they were followed by several officers. At least one man was told by a police officer\nto empty his pockets, although he finally allowed him to continue without further consequences.\nAnother time, when two of the pro-life volunteers came to store material at the pro-life shelter located near the abortion business, several of the feminists made a beeline toward them carrying a banner. The police prevented them from approaching, warning the abortion advocates that\nthey were seeking “confrontation” with the young pro-life women.\nThis was not the only rosary planned for this day. At 6:30 p.m. several organizations were to gather at the site with the same intention. Also expected to attend was José Andrés Calderón, the young organizer of the public rosaries for the unity of Spain, which has been going on for almost 50 days.\nThis story\nwas first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA.\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides,\nplease consider donating to support our efforts.
