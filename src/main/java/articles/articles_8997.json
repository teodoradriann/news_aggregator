    "title": "Ottobre come giugno, torna l’anticiclone africano a Napoli. Tanto sole e caldo: fino a quando",
    "text": "Dopo la fase di maltempo delle scorse settimane, stando alle previsioni meteo, l’anticiclone africano tornerà a toccare il Sud Italia, regalando giornate di sole e caldo anche a Napoli e in Campania . Si realizzerà, così, quella cosiddetta Ottobrata che darà spazio a un clima mite e piacevole, più estivo che autunnale.\nMeteo, arriva il caldo a Napoli e in Campania: quanto durerà Un vasto campo di alta pressione si intensificherà sempre più nel Mediterraneo, alimentato da aria calda proveniente dal continente africano . Una condizione che causerà un graduale aumento delle temperature nella zona del Centro-Sud, dove si toccheranno anche picchi importanti.\nDopo un fine settimana stabile, sarà dall’inizio della prossima settimana che la pressione tenderà ad aumentare così come i valori termici. In città come Napoli e Roma si toccheranno i 26 gradi mentre nelle isole si supereranno addirittura i 30 gradi. Una parentesi soleggiata che dovrebbe accompagnarci quasi per tutta la settimana dando vita alla classica Ottobrata, caratterizzata da giornate molto gradevoli.\n“ Già nel weekend rivivremo le belle giornate . Lungo le coste il sole scalderà quasi ovunque fino a valori gradevoli: sono previste massime di 28 gradi in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27 gradi in Puglia e Calabria, 25/26 gradi in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24, Firenze a 22 e Milano sui 20 gradi” – ha spiegato Antonio Sanò, meteorologo e fondatore de Il Meteo.\n“Il bel tempo dovrebbe continuare anche la prossima settimana. Addirittura le ultime emissioni dei modelli indicano la possibilità della persistenza del bel tempo quasi fino alla fine del mese , con una lunga e mite Ottobrata su buona parte del paese. In questa proiezione meteo ottimistica troviamo solo due veloci passaggi perturbati venerdì 18 e venerdì 25 ottobre, per il resto l’anticiclone potrebbe fermarsi a lungo sul nostro paese”.\nIl maltempo, dunque, dovrebbe essere rimpiazzato da un quadro meteorologico molto più piacevole e stabile quasi per tutto il mese. Vista la distanza temporale, tuttavia, si attendono ulteriori aggiornamenti.",

    "text": "The Benefits of Using Sulfur Soap for Oily Skin\nIf your skin constantly feels greasy or you’re dealing with frequent breakouts, it’s worth looking into sulfur soap. You might think of sulfur as something outdated or harsh, but there’s a reason it keeps coming back because it works wonders for your skin.\nSulfur soap is known for helping people with oily or acne-prone skin. And while it’s not a magic fix, it can make a real difference if you use it the right way.\nHere’s how that plays out in your daily skincare routine.\n- Sulfur Soap Clears Pores by Removing Dead Skin Cells\nSulfur breaks down keratin, which is a protein that can build up and clog pores. When that buildup is gone, your skin feels smoother and looks more even. This process is called keratolysis, and it helps prevent blackheads and a rough texture.\nIf you’ve got bumps, flakes, or spots that keep returning, sulfur may help clear the path without using rough scrubs or strong acids.\n- Sulfur Soap Reduces Oil Without Overdrying\nMany products for oily skin are too harsh. They strip the skin and cause it to produce even more oil to make up for the loss. Sulfur is different. It absorbs oil without disrupting the skin barrier. That’s why it works well as a daily or near-daily cleanser, even if your skin is sensitive.\nIt won’t leave your face squeaky clean, and that’s a good thing. Clean doesn’t have to mean dry skin.\n- Sulfur Soap Fights the Bacteria That Cause Acne\nSulfur creates by-products like hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide that make it harder for bacteria and fungi to survive. Research shows that it can reduce common acne triggers like Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus, and Malassezia.\nThis makes sulfur helpful for both oily skin and sensitive skin that breaks out easily.\n- Sulfur Soap Calms Inflammation\nSulfur may also help if your skin gets red, irritated, or inflamed. It affects certain pathways in the body, like NF-κB and STAT3, that are linked to skin irritation and flare-ups.\nIf your oily skin is also reactive or prone to sensitivity, sulfur can bring some balance. Many people notice that blemishes heal faster and redness fades sooner when they use sulfur-based products regularly.\n- The Right Sulfur Soaps Add Back What Oily Skin Still Needs\nGood sulfur soaps also add moisture, too. Look for ones with skin-friendly ingredients like:\n- Avocado oil – Rich in vitamins A, B, D, E, and potassium. It helps soften and nourish your skin.\n- Olive oil – Acts as a natural barrier that locks in moisture. It also soothes and supports the skin’s repair process.\n- Shea butter – Known for its vitamin content and ability to keep skin soft without making it greasy.\nThese oils help sulfur do its job without leaving your skin dry or tight afterwards.\nHow to Use Sulfur Soap Without Overdoing It\nIf you’ve never used sulfur soap before, go slow.\nStep 1: Wet your face\nUse lukewarm water. Hot water can strip the skin.\nStep 2: Lather the soap in your hands\nApply the foam to your face and focus on oily areas like the T-zone.\nStep 3: Let the foam sit for 10 to 15 seconds\nThis gives the sulfur time to act on bacteria and excess oil.\nStep 4: Rinse well and pat dry\nAvoid scrubbing. Follow with a simple moisturiser or serum. Start by using it 3 to 4 times a week. You can start using it daily if your skin handles it well.\nIf you have back or chest acne, you can use the same soap as a body wash on those areas.\nWrapping Up\nSulfur soap isn’t trendy, but it works. It helps oily skin stay balanced, clears out gunk from your pores, fights acne-causing bacteria, and calms flare-ups, all without being too harsh.\nAnd when it’s made with nourishing ingredients like olive oil, avocado oil, and shea butter, it supports your skin chemistry.\nIf your current cleanser isn’t doing much or is making things worse, sulfur soap is worth a try.",
