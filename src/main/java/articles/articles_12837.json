    "title": "Colorado Red Lobster restaurant finds rare orange lobster in shipment, takes it to Denver aquarium",
    "text": "The Downtown Aquarium in Denver has a new resident — a rare orange lobster that was rescued from a shipment of crustaceans delivered to a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado. A long-term employee who is a dishwasher and head biscuit maker spotted the bright orange lobster while unpacking a shipment last Friday and alerted restaurant managers, aquarium officials said. The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos&#039; legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986. Orange Lobster “Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,” said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant&#039;s general manager. “And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.&quot; When the Pueblo Zoo couldn&#039;t take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away. Kastendieck packed Crush with ice packs in a plastic foam container and delivered it to the aquarium on Wednesday. “As soon as they acclimated him to his quarantine tank at the Denver aquarium, he was very active right off the bat and was really exploring his little area,” Kastendieck said Thursday. Staff had set up a tank with a new generation Denver Broncos helmet on top and an older generation one sitting in the tank “so he can actually climb into it and play around it,” she said. Crush will be examined by a veterinarian and after 30 days in quarantine will be placed in the “Lurks” exhibit that houses other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, aquarium staff said. “We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,” Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver Downtown Aquarium, said in a statement. Crush was shipped to the Pueblo restaurant from a supplier in Tennessee. It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast. Genetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow. Downtown Aquarium has had one orange lobster previously. The Downtown Aquarium has more than 700 species of fish along with a stingray reef and three Sumatran tigers. ___ Hanson reported from Helena, Montana.

    "title": "Gold price soars to fresh record high as trade tensions sink US Dollar",
    "text": "- Gold hits third record high this week as trade war escalates; Trump targets rare earth imports from China.\n- DXY drops 0.83% to 99.17, boosting gold as investors seek safety amid global economic uncertainty.\n- Powell says Fed must stay vigilant on inflation, lowering rate cut hopes; focus shifts to jobless claims, housing data.\nGold price extended its record streak for the third time in the week as the Greenback weakened due to tensions between China and the US related to trade policies. These tensions are increasing the appeal of safe-haven assets like precious metals. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $3,342, up more than 3.50%.\nThe trade-war escalation turned sentiment sour as the US President Donald Trump ordered an investigation to apply tariffs on rare earth imports, escalating the dispute with China.\nBullion hit record highs on Monday and Wednesday, with the all-time high (ATH) reaching $3,343. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck's performance against a basket of six currencies, dropped 0.83% to 99.17.\nIn the meantime, Fed Chair Powell shattered rate cut expectations by stressing that the central bank must ensure tariffs don’t trigger a more persistent rise in inflation.\n“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.\nData-wise, US Retail Sales exceeded projections, compared to the previous reading. US Industrial Production hinted that manufacturing activity continued to slow down,\nThis week, Gold traders await housing data and Initial Jobless Claims.\nDaily digest market movers: Gold price capitalizes gains on falling US yields\n- The US 10-year Treasury yield tumbled almost six basis points to 4.281%. US real yields fell three and a half bps to 2.111%, as shown by the US 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields failing to cap Gold prices.\n- Fed Chair Powell revealed that a weakening economy and high inflation could conflict with the central bank's two goals, making a stagflationary scenario possible.\n- “We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,” he said. “If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”\n- Money market players had priced in 91 bps of easing by the Fed toward the end of 2025. The first cut is expected in July.\n- Data-wise, US Retail Sales rose 1.4% MoM in March, beating the 1.3% forecast and surging from February’s 0.2%, boosted by strong auto sales. However, the control group—used for GDP calculations—rose just 0.4%, down from 1.3% and missing the 0.6% estimate.\n- The Federal Reserve announced that Industrial Production fell 0.3% in March, following a 0.8% increase in February.\n- XAU/USD technical outlook: Gold price poised to test new record highs at $3,400\nGold price uptrend remains in place with buyers eyeing the $3,350 figure. A breach of the latter will expose the $3,400 figure, followed by key psychological levels like $3,450 and $3,500.\nConversely if XAU/USD falls below $3,300, the first support would be the April 16 low of $3,229, followed by the $3,200 figure.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.\nThe price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

    "text": "Paris Paralympics: Para-archers Harvinder Singh, Pooja Jatyan advance to QFs of Mixed Team Recurve Open I ndian para-archers Harvinder Singh and Pooja Jatyan advanced to the quarterfinals of the Mixed Team Recurve Open at the ongoing Paris Paralympics 2024 on Thursday. The Indian pair defeated Amanda Jennings and Taymon Kenton-Smith of Australia 5-4. They will either face hosts (France) or Poland in the last eight. Earlier on Wednesday, Harvinder secured a historic gold medal for the country at the ongoing marquee event becoming the first-ever Indian to have won a medal in the sport across both the Olympics and Paralympics. In the gold medal clash of the individual recurve para-archery against Poland's Lukasz Ciszek, Harvinder won 6-0. He also secured a medal in two successive Paralympics, having won a bronze medal in the recurve para-archery at the Tokyo Paralympics 2020. Harvinder's success marked India's second medal in archery at the ongoing Paris Paralympics. The Indian archery pair of Rakesh Kumar and Sheetal Devi clinched the bronze medal in the mixed team compound event. On the other hand, Pooja went down fighting against China's Wu Chunyan in the quarterfinals of the Women's Individual Recurve Open at the ongoing Paris Paralympics 2024. She lost the quarterfinal clash 4-6 against the Chinese opponent on Tuesday. Para-athlete Sachin Khilari clinched the silver medal in the men's shot put F46 final at the ongoing Paris Paralympics. Sachin secured the second spot with a 16.32-metre throw, which is also the area best (AB). However, the Indian athlete was unlucky to miss the top spot after getting short of a 0.6m. On Monday and Tuesday, the Indian contingent won 13 medals for the country, jumping the medal tally to a record 20 consisting of three gold, seven silver and 10 bronze medals. The Indian contingent has now added 24 medals to its growing tally (five gold, nine silver, and ten bronze) and will have an opportunity to further extend its record medal haul in a single edition of the Paralympics. India is ranked 15th in the medal tally and with more days left, they have a chance to add plenty more. In the Tokyo edition (August 24 - September 5, 2021), India recorded its best-ever medal haul with a tally of 19, including five gold, eight silver and six bronze medals. ✔️ Paris Paralympics: Para-archers Harvinder Singh, Pooja Jatyan advance to QFs of Mixed Team Recurve Open 💕 Found this article helpful?

    "text": "Las previsiones meteorológicas de este mes de mayo están siendo, al menos de momento, especialmente inestables. El verano parece que se resiste todavía a llegar a nuestro país, aunque lo cierto es que ya hemos notado cambios importantes en el apartado de las temperaturas. No obstante, los expertos dibujan un escenario en el que podríamos tener otro cambio radical a la vista. De momento, el panorama para este viernes 10 de mayo es especialmente cálido. Las temperaturas, desde hace ya unos días, han sufrido un subidón considerable, llevándonos, según la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), a valores propios del mes de junio. Sin embargo, parece que es pronto para sacar la ropa de verano, a juzgar por las previsiones para los próximos días. Según la AEMET, aunque la tónica predominante de este fin de semana será la estabilidad, estamos a las puertas de la entrada de una Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos (DANA), que afectará, según los expertos, al noroeste peninsular y que se irá desplazando hacia el este de cara al domingo. La AEMET prevé chubascos y tormentas en estas zonas de cara a la recta final de esta semana, y no son los únicos. Por su parte, Mario Picazo, de 'eltiempo.es', habla directamente de un cambio radical del tiempo. A pesar de que reconoce también que este fin de semana será especialmente caluroso en casi todo el país, Picazo prevé la llegada de una borrasca atlántica, también de cara al domingo 12 de mayo. De esta forma, parece que el domingo será una jornada fría y pasada por agua. Por si fuera poco, las previsiones a largo plazo de la AEMET vislumbran también un panorama marcado por la inestabilidad de cara a la próxima semana. Entre los días 13 y 19 de este mes, los expertos prevén \"circulación atlántica, con paso de frentes\". El mismo lunes 13 de mayo podríamos tener \"precipitaciones abundantes en Galicia, el Cantábrico, el alto Ebro, el sistema Ibérico y los Pirineos.",

    "text": "John Calipari Jokes About Arkansas’ Tough NCAA Path, Busy Bracket\nJohn Calipari humorously anticipated Arkansas’ matchup with Kansas and St. John's in the NCAA tournament bracket but was surprised by the site selection. During a media session, he shared his foresight with Razorback players, indicating he believed both teams would be on their path. Calipari acknowledged the challenge of facing Kansas, calling their head coach Bill Self a respected adversary. He expressed both admiration for Self and the difficulties of competing in March Madness. Calipari also joked about being left out of Providence, remarking on the unexpected location of the games.\n- Calipari predicted Arkansas would meet Kansas and St. John's in the tournament.\n- He humorously expressed surprise at not being assigned the venue of Rupp Arena, his former coaching site.\nDespite Calipari's jokes, there are pressures and expectations for the teams involved, reflecting a mix of respect and rivalry among the coaches. The dynamics of high-stakes tournament play can complicate seamlessly anticipated matchups, revealing unpredictable outcomes.\nState of Play- Calipari emphasized that the coaching matchup in Providence would feature notable figures like himself, Self, and Rick Pitino.\n- The teams involved are currently in varying forms, with both Arkansas and Kansas facing challenges throughout the season.\nAs the tournament approaches, expect excitement and competitive tension as Arkansas faces potentially tough matches against Kansas or St. John's. The dynamics among the coaches will likely influence game strategies and highlight key rivalries.\nBottom LineThe anticipation of March Madness is palpable, and Calipari’s insights reveal both the challenges and excitement of facing top-tier opponents.

    "title": "Re: Nest Doorbell Gen 1",
    "text": "Sunday\nWe have a Gen 1 wired Nest doorbell. The doorbell portion quit recently. The camera works but freezes when the doorbell is pushed. There is no audible tone. We purchased a replacement through Amazon. It does not specify what generation it is..just shows the Google G on the box and Neat Doorbell. I have not migrated my subscription and account over to Google, having preferred to remain with just Nest. How do I proceed with the replacement doorbell? It does not seem to work with the existing app. Am I forced to cancel my existing subscription and account? Am I now forced to migrate to Google? If that is the case, does an entirely new account need to be set up? Will I get a refund on my original subscription that auto-renewed a short time ago? Thank you.\nAnswered!\nGo to the Recommended Answer.\nSunday\nFirst, the 1st gen Google Nest Hello Doorbell is no longer sold, at least in the U.S. So you may have purchased the 2nd gen Google Nest Doorbell (installed only in the Google Home app), shown in this install video: https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12570869). If that's what you have, then yes you will need to cancel your 1st gen Nest Aware subscription (for which you are supposed to receive a pro-rated refund), migrate your Nest Account to a Google Account https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9297676, install your 2nd gen doorbell in the Google Home app, and get a 2nd gen Nest Aware subscription (which are priced better if you have several cameras; see the prices here: https://store.google.com/product/nest_aware?hl=en-US&modal=upgrade-pricing).\nSecond, what happened to your 1st gen Google Nest Hello Doorbell may be the same thing that's happened to all 3 of our Nest Hellos, and that of many other customers. The Nest Hello has a small internal battery whose purpose is to provide power to the camera during the instant when the doorbell button is pressed. When the battery eventually fails, the doorbell goes offline for a minute whenever the doorbell button is pressed. This very long thread with over 1,000 replies is about this failure: https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Cameras-and-Doorbells/Nest-Hello-Doorbell-cuts-out-when-button-is-pressed/m-p/315209//\nThere is a workaround. If you turn off the \"Indoor chime\" option, your doorbell will no longer try to ring your indoor doorbell chime and will not go offline anymore. We've done that with all 3 of our Nest Hellos, and have instead turned on the \"Visitor announcements\" option https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7672451 to get announcements on our Nest Hubs and Nest Mini instead.\nSunday\nFirst, the 1st gen Google Nest Hello Doorbell is no longer sold, at least in the U.S. So you may have purchased the 2nd gen Google Nest Doorbell (installed only in the Google Home app), shown in this install video: https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12570869).

I do not have a Google Assistant-enabled speaker, but we are considering just installing an old-style doorbell button alongside our Gen 1 Nest Doorbell. The camera still works. Do you see any issue with this interfering with the Nest camera operating normally? We like the ring of a doorbell so our dog barks and allows us to know someone has arrived, even if we are not near our phones.\nThank you!\n32m ago\nYou would have to figure out how to wire the conventional doorbell along with your gen 1 Nest Hello Doorbell, since both would need be powered via your doorbell transformer. I don't know how they would need to be wired; maybe that might involve running a second set of doorbell wires to your transformer.\nThe \"Visitor announcements\" option, when enabled, triggers a \"Ding-dong\" sound along with an oral \"Someone's at the front door\" announcement on any Nest speakers that are NOT set to \"Do Not Disturb\". The volume depends on whatever you set the speaker to. You could get a Nest Mini, which retails for $49 when not on sale. The announcement is quite noticeable, but our dog has never barked at doorbells.\nTo use a Nest Mini, you would have to migrate your Nest Account to a Google Account https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9297676, then install the Nest Mini in your Google Nest \"home/structure\" in the Google Home app. I believe you'd be able to keep your 1st gen Nest Aware subscription; you just can't purchase new 1st gen subscriptions.\nOr you could get the 2nd gen doorbell, but you'd also have to migrate your Nest Account to a Google Account. Note also that the image on the 2nd gen doorbell is taller and narrower than on the 1st gen Nest Hello.",

    "text": "Sanidade detecta incumplimientos en el 45% de negocios alimentarios\nLa higiene se asocia a la mayor parte de las irregularidades detectadas en unos 4.800 establecimientos | En 160 casos se procedió a la retirada del producto del mercado\nC. Villar\nFabricantes, envasadores, almacenistas, comerciantes al por menor, hipermercados, restaurantes o heladerías tienen en común la delicada materia prima con la que trabajan, los alimentos, y están sometidos en Galicia a un servicio de control y supervisión del que se encarga la Consellería de Sanidade. La intensificación de la actividad fiscalizadora de su personal se tradujo en un 9,4 por ciento más de inspecciones realizadas en un año, hasta las cuarenta de media cada día y, en la misma medida, de negocios examinados, más de 200 de media por semana. Toda esa labor se saldó con detecciones de incumplimientos en casi la mitad de los establecimientos.\nSegún datos facilitados por la Consellería de Sanidade a este diario, la Xunta realizó a lo largo del año 2023 —el último del que ofrece datos— un total de 15.059 inspecciones de establecimientos alimentarios en las que su personal pasó revista a hasta 10.762 negocios diferentes. De ellos, en casi un 45 por ciento —4.813 en concreto, un 7% más— «se detectaron incumplimientos».\nLas inobservancias que analizan los inspectores pueden abarcar distintos aspectos: de tipo operacional (cómo funciona en su día a día el local), estructural, de producto o de información al consumidor. Desde el departamento sanitario autonómico indican que durante 2023 «la mayor parte» de los incumplimientos detectados por el personal de Inspección Veterinaria de Saúde Pública tienen que ver con «medidas de higiene». De hecho, en el listado de comprobaciones que manejan los inspectores, se enfatizan especialmente estos requisitos.\nLas irregularidades halladas pueden acabar en sanción, pero antes Sanidade advierte de las deficiencias e insta a su corrección. Así, en 2023, detallan desde la Consellería, se realizaron 861 requerimientos de corrección del incumplimiento. Si bien la Xunta elevó la presión de sus inspecciones y puso más negocios bajo la lupa, las propuestas de apertura de expediente por infracciones se rebajaron en una cuarta parte con respecto a las contabilizadas un año antes: fueron 359 frente a las 489 de 2022, cuando ya se había notado un descenso en relación las 531 de 2021.\nNo es inusual que la Xunta decrete la suspensión de actividad del negocio analizado, una decisión que tomó en 106 casos en 2023 y además en 160 ocasiones apunta que se realizaron retiradas de productos del mercado.\nAunque los datos de inspecciones de 2024 están siendo todavía recopilados, la Consellería de Sanidade dispone ya de ejemplos de infracciones leves detectados durante el año pasado y cita incumplimientos «por condiciones higiénico-sanitarias» —con sanciones de hasta 1.200 euros— o deficiencias administrativas relacionadas con la inscripción en los registros sanitarios —penalizados con sanciones de hasta 600 euros, salvo que requieran autorización administrativa—.\nA diferencia de 2023, en el que no se registró en Galicia ninguna sanción grave —que puede suponer entre 20.001 y 600.000 euros de penalización—, en 2024 se sancionó a un establecimiento por «comercialización de alimentos sin identificación y utilizando una marca sanitaria falsa». Ese expediente, añade Sanidade, finalizó con una sanción de 20.001 euros, con deducción del 20% por reconocimiento de responsabilidad y pronto pago.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",
