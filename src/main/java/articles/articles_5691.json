    "title": "Alcaldesa electa de Chiapas hace mal uso de banda presidencial y modifica escudo nacional",
    "text": "Usuarios afirman que debe aplicarse la ley por el uso indebido de los símbolos nacionales. | Especial Blanca Yaneth Chiu López, alcaldesa electa de Jiquipilas, Chiapas, publicó unas fotografías donde se aprecia el uso indebido de la banda presidencial y la modificación del escudo nacional. La alcaldesa electa de Morena difundió en redes sociales fotografías portando la banda presidencial, pero con el escudo nacional modificado: en lugar del águila se observa el rostro de la presidenta electa Claudia Sheinbaum. Las imágenes se difundieron luego de que la alcaldesa iniciara un recorrido para agradecer a sus simpatizantes en diversas colonias y barrios del municipio, por el apoyo en la jornada electoral donde resultó ganadora. Cabe señalar que, según la ley, el uso de la banda presidencial es exclusivo para el titular del Poder Ejecutivo. En 2018, el pleno del Senado aprobó reformas a la Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacional, en las que establecen sanciones que van desde una amonestación con apercibimiento, una multa de hasta 10 mil veces el Valor de la Unidad de Medida y Actualización (unos 806 mil pesos) por cada día que persista la infracción, o un arresto de hasta por 36 horas, si se reincide, por el uso ilegal de la banda presidencial. Las imágenes que publicó la alcaldesa electa han causado diversos comentarios en redes sociales, en los cuales los internautas afirman que debe aplicarse la ley por el uso indebido de los símbolos nacionales.

    "text": "Faith and Grief Intertwine in Texas Flood Recovery: ‘Y’all Pray and Keep Praying’\nThe people of Kerrville, Texas, are mourning the lives lost as they continue searching for victims of the catastrophic floods. At least 120 people are dead and 150 are missing. Volunteers from across the country are gathering together to help the grieving community.\nThe Guadalupe River has returned to a dry, deceptive calm following the devastating July Fourth flash flood, but the anguish still lingers in Kerr County.\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\n“This is something that’s going to stay with this community forever,” said Pastor Phil Jackson of Kerrville First Assembly of God.\nPastor Jackson lost a member of his congregation in the flood. “In trying to save his family, he punched a hole through a glass window, cut his main artery, and bled out in front of them. He died,” Jackson said.\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nDespite the loss, Jackson and his church are channeling their grief into service. Kerrville First Assembly has partnered with the faith-based relief group Operation Blessing, using its kitchen to prepare hundreds of hot meals daily for first responders.\n“They’ve pulled several bodies out of the river,” said Ryan Yost, a disaster relief chef with Operation Blessing. “It makes you realize that as a chef, providing food helps them take care of themselves so they can do the job not many want to do.”\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nMuch of the relief coordination is happening at the Centerpoint Distribution Center, where first responders and volunteers gather — some even on four legs.\nTo read the full story, visit our content partners at CBN News.\nReprinted with permission from cbn.com.
