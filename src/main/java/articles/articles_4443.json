    "text": "O Japão registou as temperaturas médias diárias mais altas para o mês de julho desde que há registos, devido a uma onda de calor oriunda do Pacífico, disse a agência meteorológica japonesa. A temperatura média diária de julho em todo o arquipélago japonês foi de 26,22º graus Célsius (ºC), um aumento de 2,16ºC em relação à média desse mês entre 1991 e 2020. Esta é a temperatura média mais elevada observada em julho desde que a Agência Meteorológica do Japão (JMA) começou a recolher estes dados, em 1898, e um recorde para o mesmo mês pelo segundo ano consecutivo. O termómetro ultrapassou os 40ºC em sete locais do país em vários dias do mês passado, de acordo com a JMA, referindo também o registo de 3.509 casos de \"calor extremo\" ou medições superiores a 35°C, até agora, em quase mil pontos de observação meteorológica no país. A agência sublinhou que, este ano, o arquipélago japonês foi afetado por um sistema de ar quente no Pacífico, no contexto do aquecimento global, o que resultou em temperaturas mais elevadas do que o habitual durante o mês de julho. \"Tal como no ano passado, uma série de fatores combinaram-se para produzir temperaturas recorde e esperamos que este calor continue até agosto e depois\", disse Masayuki Hirai, meteorologista da JMA, em conferência de imprensa. A partir de sexta-feira, grande parte do oeste, centro e norte do Japão está sob alerta de temperaturas elevadas, com o termómetro a subir acima dos 38ºC e mesmo 39ºC em zonas das regiões de Quioto, Osaca e Yamaguchi.",

    "text": "President William Ruto has extended his Easter greetings to Kenyans and people around the globe, inviting everyone to join in reflection on the profound lessons embedded in the Easter period. President Ruto pens Easter message to Kenyans President Ruto calls for reflection, hope, and solidarity in his 2024 Easter holiday message Recommended articles The President's message shared on Friday, March 29, emphasized the themes of sacrifice, suffering, and ultimate triumph that are central to the Easter celebration. \"Easter is a time to commemorate the intense suffering and the ultimate sacrifice made by the Son of God for our redemption, granting us the grace for salvation and the promise of eternal life,\" President Ruto said. He stressed the importance of reflecting on the hardships endured by Christ, including betrayal, torture, and crucifixion, to appreciate the victory over death and the hope this victory brings to humanity. The President highlighted the universal experiences of suffering, deprivation, and frustration. He pointed out that Easter offers hope not by denying these hardships but by showing that through discipline, commitment, and hard work, individuals can overcome adversity. \"It tells us that we can triumph over adversity, transcend our challenges and find happiness, success, and prosperity,\" he noted. Furthermore, President Ruto encouraged communities and the nation at large to draw inspiration from Easter's message of hope. He added that with a solid plan, unity, and a commitment to integrity and efficiency, Kenyans can navigate obstacles and lay a strong foundation for future generations to enjoy the country's abundance. The President's message also called on Kenyans to emulate the divine example of resilience and victory over suffering demonstrated by Christ. \"Let us celebrate this miraculous model now, and throughout our life as we serve God, build our nation and work for humanity,\" he urged. In closing, President Ruto called for compassion and solidarity, asking everyone to be there for those in need, whether through prayer, a kind word, or material support. \"Let us take time to be there for our fellow humans, and remember to stand with those in need,\" he stated. With Easter being a time of renewal and hope, the President's message serves as a reminder of the power of faith, the importance of community, and the strength that comes from collective effort and mutual support.

    "text": "Aguibou Camara’s second-half goal fired Guinea to a precious 1-0 victory over Gambia in Group C of the Africa Cup of Nations. Both nations had failed to claim all three points in their tournament openers and were aware of the significance on this fixture towards their knockout stage hopes. After a goalless first half in Yamoussoukro, Camera made the breakthrough with 21 minutes left when he slid home from Morgan Guilavogui’s cross and it proved enough to move Guinea up to four points ahead of their final group game with current leaders Senegal. ⌚️ FULL-TIME! Guinea breaks the deadlock with one goal to win today’s 3 points against The Gambia! ⚡️ [#TotalEnergiesAFCON2023]| [#GUIGAM] [pic.twitter.com/YGsAQCIN9J] — CAF (@CAF_Online) [January 19, 2024]Advertisement Gambia boss Tom Saintfiet shuffled his pack with five changes made from their opening loss to Senegal, but chances were few and far between early on. Guinea almost took the lead in the 33rd minute, but Mohamed Bayo’s right-footed strike hit the post and it remained 0-0 at half-time. Kaba Diawara’s Guinea continued to press for the opener and forced a number of corners before the deadlock was finally broken after 69 minutes. Guilavogui was the architect for the goal after he collected Ibrahim Diakite’s pass and cut back for Camara to poke home after he beat Gambia defender James Gomez to the centre. It sparked jubilant scenes from the Guinea team and it was almost 2-0 moments later, but Bayo struck the crossbar from close range. Ex-Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita was introduced late on and he helped Guinea hold on for a potentially vital victory to claim a semblance of revenge after Gambia knocked them out of the 2021 edition in the last-16 stage.",

    "text": "[Texas A&M AgriLife Research](https://agriliferesearch.tamu.edu/) received more than $5.2 million in grant funding from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/) for a project to address multiple aspects of the southern U.S. onion harvest system. The director for the “Ensuring Future Economic Viability of U.S. Short-Day Onion Production Through Mechanical Harvesting” project will be Subas Malla, Ph.D. Malla is an AgriLife Research associate professor of vegetable breeding at the [Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Uvalde.](https://uvalde.tamu.edu/) The [Texas A&M](https://tamu.edu/) AgriLife team is comprised of Stephen Searcy, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus and former head of the [Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering](https://baen.tamu.edu/), Bryan-College Station; Juan Anciso, Ph.D., professor and [Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service](https://agrilifeextension.tamu.edu) vegetable specialist, Weslaco; Francisco Abello, Ph.D., assistant professor and AgriLife Extension economist – management, Vernon; and Larry Stein, Ph.D., professor, Regents Fellow and associate head of the [Department of Horticultural Sciences](https://hortsciences.tamu.edu/), Uvalde. The University of California, the University of Georgia and New Mexico State University will also partner on the project. Searcy will serve as co-director and lead the project’s agricultural engineering research. Anciso and Abello will lead the AgriLife Extension and economic analysis components, respectively. “The goal of this proposal is to improve profitability and ultimately market share for short-day onions by mechanizing short-day onion harvesting,” Malla said. “We intend to do this through development and selection of cultivars, optimization of production practices, improved harvest systems, and communication of the associated socioeconomic benefits to growers and packers.” Short-day onions long on production challenges The majority of onions grown across the southern region of the U.S. are short-day onions. Short-day onions require about 10-12 hours of daylight to produce bulbs, while long-day onions require 14-16 hours. According to South Texas Growers Inc., a wholesale nursery, in 2023, the state’s fresh market onion industry — sweet, yellow, red and white onions combined — grew a total of 75,460 tons across 7,158 acres in the 35 South Texas counties. The average farm-gate value of those onions is around $39 million. Short-day onions are a high-value vegetable crop in many southern U.S. states, including Texas, but their biology and structure present some difficulties, especially during harvest. Onion harvesters developed for long-day onions in northern states have been tested with short-day onions, Searcy said, but growers judged the results to be less than satisfactory. “Dry matter content in the short-day sweet onion is low but the water content is high,” Malla said. “Due to the high water content in the bulb, there is a greater likelihood of bruise damage since the bulbs can’t withstand a higher-pressure impact when harvested. That is why short-day onions have traditionally been harvested by hand.” In efforts to use mechanized harvesting, too many bulbs were damaged to be acceptable for the fresh market, he said. “However, these past attempts were limited to substituting the mechanical harvester for manual labor and did not involve a whole-system approach.” The new project aimed at mechanizing harvest will involve the whole system and include short-day onion areas in Georgia, Texas, New Mexico and California to represent a full range of growing conditions. “Limited availability and increasing cost of labor has resulted in decreased U.S. short-day onion production and a lack of competitiveness with foreign sources,” Malla said. “A viable mechanized harvest system is a high priority for growers and the industry.” Building a better short-day onion harvest system Malla said the project will address the many facets of developing a successful harvest system. These include: – Identifying cultivars and production practices suitable for mechanical harvesting. – Modifying the harvest system to minimize the potential damage to onion bulbs. – Evaluating the influence of mechanical harvest on profitability and risk faced by onion growers. – Communicating the benefits and drawbacks of adopting mechanical harvesting to growers. Malla said the adoption of any advances by growers will rely on partnerships with equipment manufacturers, seed companies and technology providers. A stakeholder advisory panel and scientific advisers will participate in the project’s proposed research and outreach activities. “We are already in the process of evaluating diverse Texas A&M onion germplasm to understand the genetic mechanism of host resistance against diseases and insects,” Malla said. “We are working with the [Texas A&M Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center](https://vfic.tamu.edu/) to test bulb quality and storability in onions. We are also testing Texas A&M onion germplasm in a way that will help shorten the cultivar development cycle.” To his knowledge, Malla said, this project is one of the broadest and most comprehensive ever undertaken to address the many challenges to short-day onion production. “Our ultimate goal is identifying the best cultivars and improving the short-day onion harvest system in a way that provides better results and better profitability for the producer,” he said. -30-",

    "text": "A Boston resident and law student is concerned that an already tight housing market in her city is being further strained by the migrant crisis. Videos from Logan Airport show dozens of migrants sleeping on cots on the floors of one of the airport's terminals, after officials have said shelters are filled to capacity. \\\"Not every state is obligated to undertake what Boston and Massachusetts have committed to do, because Massachusetts is the only state in the country that has the right to shelter law,\\\" Jill Jacobson told \\\"Fox & Friends\\\" host Lawrence Jones on Thursday. \\\"So there is a legal obligation to provide housing for these individuals, but, Boston already is [in] the midst of a huge housing crisis with its lifelong residents. We have a very tight housing market here, so we're legally obligated to provide housing that, unfortunately, we just don't have.\\\" BOSTON ANNOUNCES REPARATIONS TASK FORCE THAT WILL STUDY IMPACT SLAVERY HAD ON RESIDENTS: CITY ‘ON TRIAL’ Her comments coincide with brewing tensions between Texas and the federal government just days after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Biden administration in a case involving a razor wire fence at the southern border. Migrants additionally continue to strain cities and states across the U.S. that struggle to find sufficient space for them. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, for instance, previously activated National Guard members to help provide basic services at the emergency shelter hotels in the Bay State. \\\"Governor Healey has reached out to the Biden administration multiple times asking for assistance, and her requests have largely fallen on deaf ears, unfortunately,\\\" Jacobson said, telling Fox News she believes the crisis is of \\\"the Biden administration's making\\\" and that state and city governments are being left to figure out how to provide migrants with basic needs. BOSTON MAYOR MICHELLE WU PROPOSES MEASURE TO ADDRESS CITY'S HOUSING SHORTAGE Costs only warrant more concern. \\\"It's projected to cost almost $1 billion to handle the migrant crisis,\\\" Jacobson continued. \\\"The average price for a one bedroom in Boston, Massachusetts, has exceeded $3,000, and that's for lifelong residents, which is why we're seeing all of our shelters at max capacity. Unfortunately, incoming migrants are being forced to sleep at places like Logan Airport.\\\" Jones asked Jacobson how she might respond to those who argue that open border immigration policies are \\\"compassionate\\\" to those seeking a better life in the U.S., to which she cautioned that such mentalities are \\\"morally hazardous\\\" considering the situations the migrants must endure. DEM GOVERNOR COMPLAINS AS MIGRANT SURGE STRAINS HER ‘RIGHT-TO-SHELTER’ STATE'S RESOURCES \\\"You convince yourself that an open-borders immigration policy, for example, is compassionate because everyone deserves the American dream,\\\" she said. \\\"We live in a great country. I would hope that everyone gets the opportunity to contribute to it and be here. It's a great place, but the problem is, when they arrive here, they're not getting the American dream. We do not have the administrative capacity to process work permits. We don't have housing. They end up in really horrible conditions, like sleeping in Logan Airport without showers or food. It's really, really cold in Boston, and they don't have anywhere to go largely, so I would say let's get honest. This is not compassionate and let's be really realistic about the capacity that we have…\\\" Healey said, Monday, \\\"Frankly, what you’ve seen at Logan has been the situation, and this is why I said months ago that we are reaching capacity here.\\\" The crisis has led to similar measures in Chicago, where migrants have been sheltering at O'Hare Airport.
