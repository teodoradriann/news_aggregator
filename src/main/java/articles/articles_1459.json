    "text": "The unionized group of Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus operators filed an intent to strike with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment after reaching an impasse in contract negotiations with RFTA. The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1774 filed the intent to strike with the state on Tuesday, citing a refusal from RFTA to accept its proposals on a wage increase, housing stipend proposal and more. A strike would only occur if CDLE approves it and if a collective bargaining agreement is not reached by Dec. 31, when the current agreement is set to expire. If the strike is approved and negotiations are not completed, the union plans to strike in the new year, ATU Local 1774 President Ed Cortez told the Aspen Daily News. “This round of negotiations started in May, and even at that time we realized that this was going to take a while based on what, in my opinion, was RFTA’s rigid approach to negotiations,” Cortez said. Negotiations between the union and RFTA began in May. The parties convened several times throughout the summer, but could not reach an agreement on cost of living adjustments. After a Sept. 9 meeting, the parties reached an impasse and the union filed its intent to strike with the state. The bus operators initially asked to increase the maximum wage to $46 per hour. RFTA proposed increasing the maximum wage to $40 from about $39, according to a RFTA press release regarding the impasse. The union requested increasing the maximum wage to $43.72, which RFTA refused, Cortez told the Aspen Daily News. “RFTA gave us a $4 increase a year ago, which was a great raise, but they’ve been deferring wages now for 14 years and they’re just getting to a point where they’re, in our opinion, where they’re near to where we want the wages to be,” he said. “The wages right now cannot compensate for someone … to be able to survive here.” Last summer, the union negotiated with RFTA to increase starting pay for bus operators by $4 to $30 an hour. The union renegotiates its collective bargaining agreement every three years, but Cortez said the move to increase wages outside of formal negotiations was urgent. While the $4 increase was imperative to keeping drivers, the union is still looking for higher wages because of rising inflation costs and the cost of living in the Roaring Fork Valley. “What (RFTA management) said to us, point blank, was, ‘We feel you’re making enough money,’” Cortez said. “There’s no empathy for the drivers, it’s strictly business and what we’re doing now is strictly business.” “We’re going to let the state settle the issue or we’re going to go on strike,” he added. RFTA did not respond to specific questions about the negotiations. It instead sent a press release regarding the impasse. “RFTA believes their final offer for wages is more than reasonable, considering the recent wage adjustments made in the last two years and their 100th percentile market position of Bus Operator wages in the state of Colorado,” RFTA said in the release. “Unfortunately, the union disagreed and rejected RFTA’s last, best final proposal on wages, and all of RFTA’s other last best final proposals that remained on the table.” The union also asked RFTA to allow the union the option to strike even after an agreement is reached, which RFTA denied. It also asked RFTA to cease its use of AlertMeter — a 60-second graphics-based test that measures an individual’s cognitive alertness — and to give bus operators a say in changes that RFTA makes that impact drivers, like the decision to use AlertMeter. In a memo RFTA sent to bus operators and obtained by the Aspen Daily News, RFTA said it “had to stand firm on rejecting any proposals that could compromise the safe and efficient delivery of our services.” “Regarding other proposals that we could not agree upon, RFTA needs to ensure we can continue to implement important safety measures, address first-time drug and alcohol policy violations, manage absenteeism effectively, and maintain essential management rights that keep our operations running smoothly and safely,” the memo states. RFTA said it anticipated a decision from CDLE within the next 20 days. If it denies a strike, the matter will go to arbitration. If a strike is approved, RFTA said it is planning contingency plans to ensure minimal disruption to its service. “RFTA respects the union’s position and is committed to achieving an outcome that minimizes disruption to the vital services our customers rely on,” said RFTA CEO Kurt Ravenschlag in the release. “We also want to acknowledge and value the contributions of our bus operators, while also responsibly managing the community tax dollars that fund our essential services.” Ravenschlag fully took the reins as RFTA CEO in September. He was previously the chief operating officer, and took over for Dan Blankenship, who announced his retirement as CEO last year. ATU Local 1774 represents the roughly 150 bus operators employed by RFTA, Cortez said. About half of them are dues-paying members of the union.",

    "title": "You Can Thank Star Trek for One of Sci-Fi TV's Biggest Years | Television Academy",
    "text": "1993 was a big year for sci-fi, thanks to shows like SeaQuest DSV, Star Trek: DS9 and The X-Files The first Star Trek spinoff of the Rick Berman era, Deep Space Nine, premiered Jan. 1993 NBC boldly went underwater with their cult-fave sci-fi series, SeaQuest DSV You Can Thank Star Trek for One of Sci-Fi TV's Biggest Years X-Files was one of several shows that wouldn't exist in part without Captain Picard. In 1993, television and science fiction boldly went farther than either had gone before, with eight sci-fi series that sparked a programming boom during the 1993-1994 TV season that was unheard of at the time. Its impetus? [Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://www.emmys.com/shows/star-trek-next-generation). When the popular Star Trek offshoot debuted in syndication in 1987 — two decades after Gene Roddenberry's original series went off the air — the voyages of Patrick Stewart's Captain Jean-Luc Picard hit its stride in the show's third and fourth seasons, when it became a smash hit. Once Paramount announced in 1993 that Next Gen's seventh season would be its last, Hollywood sought to fill that void and service a fanbase hungry for more sci-fi TV. (Fittingly, in the same year that news broke of Star Trek: The Next Generation's farewell, a new sci-fi phenomenon would launch: Fox's [The X-Files](https://www.emmys.com/shows/x-files).) With Star Trek and The X-Files tapping a then-underserviced market and audience, eight high-profile, live-action series made their debuts. Some earned cult status; one is regarded as an exemplar of the genre. Here's a look back, in order of release, at those shows and their impact on television: [Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](https://www.emmys.com/shows/star-trek-deep-space-nine-1) (1993-1999) Original Airdate: January 3, 1993 Number of episodes: 173 In the wake of The Next Generation, what better way to carry the franchise torch than a brand-new series? While TNG had been a big risk six years earlier, this was oddly an even bigger one, because if it failed, any momentum that TNG had gained would have been squandered. But excellent writing and a great cast led by Avery Brooks as Captain Ben Sisko took care of that. Set concurrently with the events of TNG, Deep Space Nine further solidified Star Trek as one of the biggest and best franchises the genre had to offer. Time Trax (1993-1994) Original Airdate: January 20, 1993 Number of episodes: 43 More than a year before Jean-Claude Van Damme played a time-traveling cop on the hunt for time-hopping criminals hiding in the past in the feature film Timecop, Dale Midkiff did it as Officer Darien Lambert, who traveled through time on the hunt for time-hopping criminals hiding in the past. The similarities don't end there, as Mia Sara appeared in both entries. The show was a big hit with fans but was ultimately canceled by the Prime Time Entertainment Network (which also aired Babylon 5, see below), because it wanted to change the direction of its programming to expand its viewership. Space Rangers (1993-1994) Original Airdate: January 27, 1993 Number of episodes: 6 This CBS series, about a ragtag police force patrolling the galaxy, struggled to find an audience despite an impressive ensemble cast that included Linda Hunt, Clint Howard, Jack McGee and an inspired episode-five cameo by Buddy Hackett (playing over-the-hill comedian Lenny Hacker. Of the series' six episodes, only four aired on the network in 1993; the other two aired with little fanfare a year later. It's a shame, because Space Rangers' premise was ahead of its time and, with a larger budget, could thrive in the current TV landscape. In short: ahead of its time and perhaps ripe for a reboot. Babylon 5 (1993-1998) Original Airdate: February 22, 1993 Number of episodes: 111 Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski envisioned and pitched a series about a 23rd-century space station as a complete, 111-chapter, five-season story that would be structured like a televised novel, with a beginning, middle and end. Despite stiff competition from the similar DS9 at the time, Straczynski mostly accomplished what he wanted to achieve, with the series recently finding new life in a 2023 animated movie entitled Bablyon 5: The Road Home. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993-1996) Original Airdate: May 22, 1993 Number of episodes: 156 There's a punchline aspect to the Power Rangers — it was called out in a first-season episode of Friends, for example. Butut for a generation of kids, these were their first superheroes. The show's low-budget, high-camp feel was part of its charm — and its durability — as a passionate fanbase has proven for 30 years. There were theatrical films in 1995 and 2017, and in 2023, most of the surviving original Rangers returned for Netflix's TV special, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always. The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. (1993-1994) Original Airdate: August 27, 1993 Number of episodes: 27 A decade before he became the lead writer and show runner of Lost, Carlton Cuse co-created this much-beloved oddity with Jeffrey Boam, the writer of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Fox executives tasked the pair with creating a show that had a similar feel and paid tribute to the old movie serials that inspired Harrison Ford's iconic archeologist. Brisco County Jr., starring Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame, was the result. Despite heaps of praise from critics, the inventive series attracted a small, albeit extremely loyal, delivering an average audience of eight million viewers. Those ratings would make for a solid hit today, but they were not enough to save the show at the time. But Brisco lives on today, thanks to a loyal following at fan conventions. The X-Files (1993-2018) Original Airdate: September 10, 1993 Number of episodes: 217 The X-Files didn't just make stars out of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, it also established a definitive style and gritty tone that have been widely imitated but rarely duplicated. Initially canceled after nine seasons, The X-Files spawned two feature films (one in the summer of 1998, the other in July 2008) before Duchovny and Anderson returned in 2016 for a two-season, limited series run on Fox. Three decades after its premiere, the truth is still out there. [SeaQuest DSV ](https://www.emmys.com/shows/seaquest-dsv)(1993-1996) Original Airdate: September 12, 1993 Number of episodes: 57 Steven Spielberg put on his executive producer hat to bring this sci-fi \"edu-tainment\" show to life on NBC. Led by Jaws star Roy Scheider, SeaQuest centered on an advanced submarine in the future that explored the depths of Earth's oceans (and sometimes encountered aliens), much like the U.S.S. Enterprise explored outer space. Despite various airings preempted by sporting events and episodes going over budget, along with some casting changes, SeaQuest garnered a fervid fanbase that tuned in every week for its then-historic use of CG visual effects to depict its action-packed subaquatic exploits.",

    "text": "Two words immediately came to mind…\nSpiritual insurrection.\nThat’s exactly what happened last Thursday inside of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. While it didn’t involve physical violence, it did involve spiritual violence – a blatant rebellion, not against flesh and blood, but against the sacred.\nAnother day, another outrage.\nWhat can be done?\nWe announced that we have sent two letters to both the Attorney General of New York and the District Attorney of New York County. We are demanding that they open an investigation into what was likely a hate crime.\nOur team did their research. We discovered that the New York Hate Crimes Act prohibits persons from selecting a victim based on their belief or perception regarding religion or religious practice. Why did they choose a Catholic church? Why not a Protestant church, Jewish synagogue, or mosque?\nYou and I know exactly why they chose St. Patrick’s.\nThey mocked our saints. They mocked our prayers. They danced in the aisles and desecrated a cathedral that was paid for with the contributions of thousands of poor, faithful Catholic immigrants.\nThey also lied and misled church officials about what they had planned. Trans activists told the New York Times they kept their true intentions “under wraps.” And in a separate video in advance of the service, the service organizer bragged and laughed about how they had deceived the church.\nIn New York, criminal trespass based on a religion or religious practice is a hate crime. And New York’s courts have recognized that those who gain access to property by deception are liable for criminal trespass.\nWill law enforcement officials act?\nWe’re not naive. The New York Attorney General is Letitia James. And the District Attorney is Alvin Bragg. They are best known for their decision to prosecute Donald Trump in what many believe is a politically-motivated witch hunt.\nIf they refuse to even investigate, let alone prosecute these anti-Catholic trans activists, their claims of impartiality will be further questioned. Does the law change based on the political ideology of the offender or victim?\nWe’re about to find out.\nHere’s what I do know:\nWhen left-wing activists get away with something, it emboldens them. When our Catholic churches came under attack by pro-abortion domestic extremists in the weeks following the Dobbs leak, copycat crimes spread throughout the country — and continue unabated to this day.\nIf we don’t do everything we can to fight back against this assault on our Church, we can expect it only to get worse.\nOne last thing…\nI know one question is bothering people.\nDid the cathedral staff know or fail to do their jobs? How did this happen without raising any suspicions?\nI’m willing to take Cardinal Dolan at his word that nobody knew. And I am certainly glad he ordered a Mass of Reparation to be said. Could the church have done more to prevent this? Of course. Was it innocent negligence or acquiescence to the pressures of the trans activists? We simply don’t know. We have been told Cardinal Dolan is deeply distraught over what happened. Certainly some changes are needed.\nWhat’s important is what they do about it now.\nThe Archdiocese must echo our call for the District Attorney and the Attorney General to act.\nIf they were truly deceived, there are grounds for an investigation into what was indeed a hate crime.\nThank you, as always for helping us do this important work.\nStay tuned.\nP.S. The cornerstone of St. Patrick’s was laid in 1858. In a ceremony at Old St. Patrick’s in the city, Archbishop Hughes announced the new cathedral would be built “for the glory of Almighty God, for the honor of the Blessed and Immaculate Virgin, for the exaltation of Holy Mother Church, for the dignity of our ancient and glorious Catholic name…”\nNothing motivates me more than defending this legacy of devotion to our Church.\nThank you for standing with us.\nI promise you we will not rest until every last option is exhausted.",

    "text": "Le mariage homosexuel est une «pratique abominable», et les couples gays sont à «lapider» car ils ont «choisi le diable» et attirent la «malédiction» divine: le président burundais Evariste Ndayishimiye s’est livré vendredi à une virulente diatribe contre l’homosexualité.\nLe chef de l’État de ce pays de l’Afrique des Grands Lacs chrétien et conservateur, où les relations entre personnes de même sexe sont sanctionnées de peines allant jusqu’à 2 ans de prison, s’exprimait lors d’une conférence publique dans la province de Cankuzo (est) retransmise à la radio et à télévision, répondant aux questions de la presse et de la population.\n«Vous m’avez posé une question sur cette pratique abominable qui fait qu’un homme se marie avec un autre homme et une femme avec une autre femme», a-t-il déclaré, avant d’évoquer la Bible. «Je vous dis la vérité, si vous voulez attirer la malédiction sur un pays, il faut laisser les gens de même sexe se marier. Vous vous souvenez de ce qui est arrivé à Sodome et Gomorrhe? Dieu en est arrivé alors à dire: «Je regrette d’avoir créé l’homme», a-t-il ajouté.\n«On devrait les mettre dans un stade» «Personnellement, je pense que si on voit ce genre d’individus au Burundi, on devrait les mettre dans un stade et les lapider avec des pierres. Et ce ne serait pas un péché pour ceux qui le feront!» a estimé Evariste Ndayishimiye, qui avait déjà appelé cette année à «bannir» les homosexuels et à les «traiter en parias». Il s’en est également pris aux pays occidentaux, qui affichent régulièrement leur opposition aux violations des droits de la communauté LGBTQ+.\nEn Ouganda, autre pays d’Afrique de l’Est, une loi votée en mai par le parlement réprimant sévèrement les pratiques homosexuelles et la «promotion de l’homosexualité» a suscité de vives condamnations occidentales et des sanctions des États-Unis.\n«Vous avez dit que les pays occidentaux tentent de forcer les petits pays pour qu’ils adoptent cette pratique, et qu’ils ne recevront aucune aide s’ils ne s’y conforment pas. Qu’ils gardent leur aide, qu’ils la gardent!» a lancé le président ougandais. «Celui qui a choisi le diable, qu’il aille vivre dans ces pays. D’ailleurs, je crois que ceux qui s’exilent dans ces pays y vont pour adopter ces pratiques (…) Qu’ils ne reviennent plus », a-t-il également fustigé.\nL’homosexualité encore très taboue en Afrique de l’Est Le Code pénal burundais réprime les relations homosexuelles, passibles d’amendes et de peines allant de 3 mois à 2 ans de prison. En mars, 24 personnes avaient été accusées de «pratiques homosexuelles ou incitation aux pratiques homosexuelles» et écrouées. Sept d’entre elles ont été condamnées, cinq à 2 ans de prison ferme et deux autres à 1 an de prison.\nEn Afrique de l’Est comme dans de nombreux pays du continent, les personnes LGBTQ+ subissent stigmatisation et discriminations dans des sociétés conservatrices, qu’elles soient majoritairement chrétiennes ou musulmanes, où l’homosexualité est taboue.\n(AFP)",
