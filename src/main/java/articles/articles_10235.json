    "text": "Mumbai: In the Kurla BEST bus accident, the death toll has risen to nine after one more injured victim succumbed to injuries during treatment at Sion Hospital. Mehatab Shaikh, 22, a resident of Govandi, was pronounced dead at 11.45 am on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department has initiated the process to revoke the driving licence of Sanjay More, the bus driver involved in the accident on December 9, which left 40 others injured. The Regional Transport Office (RTO) at Wadala, overseeing Mumbai’s eastern suburbs, issued a show-cause notice to More earlier this week, beginning the procedure to cancel his licence.\nInitially issued a licence for light motor vehicles in 1990, More’s licence was upgraded in 1991 to include heavy vehicles like buses and trucks. Additionally, he held a driver’s badge for public service vehicles since 1999.\nThe decision to revoke his licence follows a request from the Mumbai police, who recommended this action due to the severity of the accident. Once revoked, More will be barred from driving any vehicle.\n<a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/kurla-bus-accident-maharashtra-motor-vehicles-department-initiates-process-to-revoke-driving-license-of-sanjay-more\">Kurla Bus Accident: Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department Initiates Process To Revoke Driving...\n</a>\nMore, employed by a third-party agency supplying drivers to Evey Trans, a subsidiary of electric bus manufacturer Olectra, had been driving BEST’s mini-buses before being assigned to operate the 12mt e-bus involved in the crash.",

    "text": "La mayor central obrera de Argentina convoca huelga general para el próximo 24 de enero La Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT), la principal central sindical de Argentina, convocó este jueves a una huelga general para el próximo 24 de enero en protesta por las amplias reformas impulsadas por el Gobierno del presidente Javier Milei. Según informó la central obrera en un comunicado, también se convocó una movilización frente a la sede del Congreso de la Nación, entre otras medidas de protesta para esa jornada. “Esto tiene que ver y es en respuesta primero a un decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) de características ilegales e inconstitucionales. No hay necesidad ni urgencia para aparecer con tantos artículos que dan vuelta a la matriz administrativa de nuestro país”, dijo el dirigente cegetista, Héctor Daer, en una conferencia de prensa. \"(Las medidas del Gobierno) apuntan contra los derechos individuales y colectivos de los trabajadores”, alertó Daer. Por su parte, el líder sindical del gremio de los camioneros, Pablo Moyano, consideró que las medidas aprobadas por Milei suponen una “vuelta al menemismo”, en referencia al ideario político del expresidente Carlos Menem (1989-1999), peronista pero de ideas neoliberales. Además, el Comité Central Confederal de la CGT aprobó efectuar una presentación judicial contra el DNU firmado el pasado 20 de diciembre por Milei, que entrará en vigor este viernes. El decreto desregula en la práctica la economía argentina y, entre otras cosas, incorpora medidas de flexibilización del mercado laboral y afecta los servicios de atención médica prestados por los sindicatos. El Comité de la CGT también rechaza el proyecto de ley remitido este miércoles por el Gobierno al Parlamento, que, de aprobarse, otorgará amplias facultades extraordinarias a Milei, quien asumió la Presidencia argentina el 10 de diciembre pasado. La CGT acordó reunirse con el resto de las centrales obreras de Argentina para articular medidas en conjunto. En las últimas dos semanas, varias organizaciones sociales y sindicales se han movilizado contra las medidas anunciadas por Milei. La misma CGT se concentró el miércoles frente a la sede de la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Nación en una movilización a la que acudieron unas 8.000 personas, según los organizadores, y que se desarrolló sin incidentes significativos. Además, la central sindical ya ha iniciado un camino judicial contra el DNU con la presentación de un primer recurso de amparo que fue desestimado por los jueces, que alegaron defectos de forma.

    "text": "Graded stakes-placed [Fingal’s Cave](https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Fingals_Cave_1) made a successful return to the races after a 432-day layoff to post a strong victory in Thursday’s $100,000 [Bay Ridge](https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2023_Bay_Ridge), a one-mile test for New York-bred fillies and mares 3 years old and up at Aqueduct. Trained by David Donk, the 4-year-old daughter of Carpe Diem had not raced since posting a deep-closing runner-up effort after a troubled start in the Grade 2 Raven Run last October at Keeneland, but she showed no signs of rust when coasting to a front-running victory over multiple graded stakes-placed Venti Valentine. [Aqueduct entries and results](https://entries.horseracingnation.com/entries-results/aqueduct). “432 (days)? I heard someone say the number and I tried not to dwell on it. As a trainer, boy could I have worked her a couple more times,” Donk said, with a laugh. “She’s got a lot of class, so I think the class prevails.” Guided to victory by Jose Lezcano, Fingal’s Cave broke evenly from post 2 in the field of six and steadily inched to the front exiting the chute to establish command over the sharp-starting Bustin Bay through an opening quarter-mile in 23.30 seconds over the muddy and sealed main track. Venti Valentine tracked between Fingal’s Cave and Bustin Bay down the backstretch before being asked to take up second position by jockey Manny Franco as Fingal’s Cave maintained her advantage and quickened to mark the half-mile in 46.52 seconds. Approaching the turn, Fingal’s Cave was met with the challenge from Venti Valentine as a patient Bustin Bay reengaged three wide under Kendrick Carmouche and was asked for her best. FINGAL'S CAVE wins the Bay Ridge Stakes impressively for David Donk with Jose Lezcano aboard!— NYRA (??) (@TheNYRA) [pic.twitter.com/vL3FyDTkQN] [December 28, 2023] Venti Valentine came under a strong ride from Franco in the turn with Bustin Bay attempting to rally in the three path, but Lezcano remained motionless aboard a loaded Fingal’s Cave into the stretch after three-quarters in 1:11.46. Lezcano shook his reins at the eighth pole and Fingal’s Cave responded with aplomb, drawing off strongly from Venti Valentine and pricking her ears just before crossing the wire 4 3/4 lengths in front in a final time of 1:37.45. Venti Valentine preserved place honors by 1 1/2 lengths over the late-running Cairo Sugar, who bested Bustin Bay by a neck. Know It All Audrey and Sweetie completed the order of finish. Sweet Mystery was scratched. Donk said he left race tactics in the capable hands of Lezcano. “I thought there would be more pace. I was satisfied that horses could close today and that it wasn’t a biased rail. Sometimes, when it gets wet and dries out, it changes throughout the day. But horses were closing,” Donk said. “I told him to ride her the way he thought was best. Jose is a really good rider and really kind. But she broke sharp and I thought being off the long layoff, she’d be a little fresh. I thought maybe one or two might be in front of her but when she was there, he did the right thing.” Lezcano, who was aboard for the first time in the afternoon, said Fingal’s Cave was highly professional. “When we broke out of the gate, my filly did everything herself,” Lezcano said. “She’s got a lot of class and broke pretty good and put herself there. I didn’t ask her for nothing. When I asked her at the quarter (pole) she went on and won the race. “When I got to the quarter, I still felt I had a lot left in the tank,” Lezcano continued. “When I asked her she went on well. I think she’s very classy.” The talented Fingal’s Cave has now won 5-of-6 lifetime starts, including an additional state-bred stakes triumph in the Fleet Indian last August at Saratoga Race Course. She earned $55,000 for her Bay Ridge triumph, boosting her total purse earnings to $370,500 while returning $6.20 on a $2 win ticket.",

    "text": "Najin port\nKim Jong-un has revived a formerly dormant port on the border with Russia that could soon help advance the country’s campaign in Ukraine. Little is known about Najin, a large port on the totalitarian nation’s northeast coast.\nBut, recent intelligence from the US has suggested it has roared back to life following a period of inactivity. Satellite imagery taken by the US and South Korean intelligence between October and December this year shows a steady parade of ships filtering in and out of the port, attended by rail cars unloading goods.\nUnfortunately for Ukraine, the port serves as a gateway to Russia and has previously facilitated trade between the two nations.\nThe latest intelligence update suggests North Korea is funnelling weapons to its neighbour and that six trips have carried arms between the nations since August, marking a potential blow to Ukraine’s defensive efforts.\nSatellite pictures released by the White House claims to show weapons passing from Naijin to the Russian town of Tikhoretsk, just 124 miles from Ukraine’s border.\nWhite House images\nThe deliveries included hundreds of thousands of artillery shells, the US has alleged, and “military material”, and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has said they also show the “rapid expansion of a munitions storage facility” from August 2023.\nThe images show excavators “digging over 100 new munitions pits” on location, designed to hold “North Korean weapons and munitions”.\nRUSI suggested North Korea is supplying Russia with “significant quantities of munitions” it has stockpiled since the close of the Korean War.\nThe institute concluded that the munitions exchange could have “profound consequences for the war in Ukraine”.\nThe report said the establishment of a “major North Korean supply line” would “alleviate shortages of munitions for what has proven to be an ordinance-hungry conflict and enable the Russian armed forces to feed their frontline troops as they try to repel a Ukrainian counteroffensive”.\nJoost Oliemans, co-author of the book The Armed Forces of North Korea, said the deliveries would “allow Russia to keep up much higher pressure for longer on Ukrainian forces”.\nThe report adds: “Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine’s defenders.”\nUp to one million new shells in Russian hands would give the aggressor nation 2,700 rounds more per day to use in its assault on the nation.\nAt the same time, the exchange will give North Korea a new income stream that could help it swerve international sanctions.",
