    "text": "Na última quarta-feira (16), um pássaro[ chamou a atenção de pesquisadores](https://ndmais.com.br/animais/conheca-o-passaro-que-acasala-e-se-alimenta-voando-a-100-km-h-e-preocupa-autoridades-espanholas/) locais da ilha de Tenerife, na Espanha, ao apresentar uma morfologia e coloração nunca vistas na região. Após a foto ser analisada por um biólogo, foi confirmado se tratar de uma espécie nativa do continente americano. A ave pode ter sido trazida pelos ventos remanescentes do [furacão](https://ndmais.com.br/animais/pets/cachorro-abandonado-durante-furacao-milton-implora-para-ser-resgatado/) Leslie, que atingiu a Europa em 2018. Pássaro foi avistado pela primeira vez na região A[ Fundação Neotropic](https://www.neotropico.org/), organização que preserva a biodiversidade na ilha de Tenerife, recebeu um aviso sobre a presença de um pequeno pássaro em uma via pública, que acabou colidindo com uma janela e ficando desorientado. A ave acabou[ chamando atenção pelo formato e coloração](https://ndmais.com.br/animais/passaros-antigos-considerados-extintos-reaparecem-apos-300-anos/) nunca vistos em outro animal da região. Após ser avistado e fotografado, ele acabou voando do local. A análise feitas pelo biólogo Jaime A. de Urioste Rodríguez confirmou que a ave se tratava de um exemplar da espécie Vireo flavifrons. No Brasil é conhecida como Juruviara-de-garganta-amarela, nativa do continente americano. Espécie pode ter sido levada pelos ventos de furacão Segundo o portal [Diário de Avisos](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/), localizado em Tenerife, a espécie pode ter sido levada para a ilha pelos fortes ventos do furacão Leslie. O fenômeno atingiu a Europa em 2018 e se tornou uma tempestade tropical recentemente ao se aproximar das [Ilhas Canárias](https://ndmais.com.br/seguranca/pescadores-de-sc-sao-presos-com-meia-tonelada-de-cocaina-na-espanha/). Esta hipótese consegue explicar como uma ave com as características dessa espécie poderia viajar milhares de quilômetros e pousar na região onde foi avistada. Conforme o portal, o fato de um pássaro tão raro e distante como o Juruviara-de-garganta-amarela ter chegado à ilha de Tenerife é um acontecimento extraordinário para a biodiversidade local e uma oportunidade para estudar os efeitos das alterações climáticas nas rotas migratórias das aves.",

    "title": "Kane County Chronicle Athlete of the Week: Francesco Benelli, Batavia, cross country, senior – Shaw Local",
    "text": "Name: Francesco Benelli School: [Batavia,](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/batavia-preps/) senior Sport: Cross country Why he was selected: At the First to the Finish 3A boys race at Detweiller Park in Peoria, Benelli was 11th out of 386 runners after crossing the line in a personal-best time of 15:02.70 to lead the Bulldogs to seventh place out of 45 teams. Benelli was selected the Kane County Chronicle Athlete of the Week in an online vote. Here is his Q&A with sports reporter Joel Boenitz. How did you feel about your performance after improving 33 places and dropping 27 seconds off your performance last year? Benelli: I definitely feel pretty good about it. I had a lot of expectations going into it because of how well I progressed last track season, so I just knew that it was going to be faster this year. I executed the plan exactly as I wanted to, which was to have a conservative start because it was really hot that day, so I just had to make sure that I was racing smart and not dying at the end. Also, I’ve been sick for the beginning of the season for about the first month or so with COVID, so I’m just rebuilding now, and it was a good confidence booster. What was the feeling of getting a personal-best time in just your second race of the season? Benelli: It felt very reassuring that I’m doing the right thing for all my practices and the mentality that we have with our team, it’s looking pretty good. It also showed me that even through sickness I’m still able to do well. Your times have dropped dramatically since your sophomore season, dropping nearly 30 seconds off your average in each of the past two seasons. What would you attribute to that success? Benelli: Definitely just consistency with my training. We’ve been incorporating a lot of tempo work, which has just helped a ton. At the beginning of the season, I’ll do 800-meter repeats at a certain pace and then maybe two weeks later, I’ll start doing kilometer repeats and then mile repeats. We kind of increase the volume and increase the pace as well as we get more comfortable with these paces and then at the end we like doing race pace work. So I think we’ve really kind of got like a system down for workouts and it’s proving really helpful. You helped the team finish seventh overall out of 45 teams. After making it to state as a team for the first time (last year), what’s the camaraderie like on the team? Benelli: It’s been awesome. We’ve been running a lot of workouts in more concise groups. Before we did one big pack, and now we’ve been able to split it up where some faster guys are running together and then we have one big pack. So our one through four runners are looking pretty solid right now, and we have our second runner, Eddie Polaski, is actually looking really well. He just progressed amazingly. So it’s just more of that five runner that we’re trying to figure out right now. There’s a lot of guys who can fight for that spot, which is good. Do you have any superstitions that you do prior to a race? Benelli: I would say, if there’s one, it would be just hydrating. I like to never risk it because anything can happen in cross country like it being super hot. So I had a rough time with with cramps before, and that’s the last thing you want to end your race. So just getting in my electrolytes and drinking water is mainly my superstition.",

Hydrating scents and silky fabrics for your frost-kissed skin.\"\nFans were loving the star's sexy batch of Instagram photos, as one praised: \"My jaw dropped!\"\nAnother added: \"You are gorgeous!\" as a third responded, \"Melt that show, queen!\"\nHadid clearly seems to be in a better mood these days, especially after finding herself tangled in the Adidas Munich Olympics ad campaign controversy.\nLast summer, the shoe company revealed the retro-inspired ad focused on the 1972 games – the same event 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were murdered by eight Palestinian terrorists.\nFollowing brutal backlash, Hadid responded: \"I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind. In advance of the campaign’s release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972.\n\"I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign. Had I been made aware, from the bottom of my heart, I would never have participated.”\nHadid then called out Adidas, raging the company \"should have known,\" and \"I should have done more research, so that I too would have known and understood and spoken up.\"\nHadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate tycoon Mohamed Hadid, added: \"As I always have, and always will, speak up for what I believe to be wrong. I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism. That will never waiver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent.\"\n\"Palestine is not synonymous with terrorism and this campaign unintentionally highlighted an event that does not represent who we are,\" she said.\nAdidas had previously apologized to Hadid and other models featured in the campaign.\nTwo months before Adidas-gate, Hadid also faced backlash after model and social media coach, Polina Nioly Pushkareva, accused the star's team of mistreating her at the Cannes Film Festival.\nShe claimed: \"It is your most important day and you wear your first ever couture dress in Cannes Red Carpet. You stand in your hotel in line for the car for the carpet. And Bella Hadid's bodyguards scream at everyone 'MOVE', push to the sides and step on your dress so it rips off.\"\nWhile Pushkareva praise \"incredible,\" Hadid, she added: \"... This idea of celebrities being more important than others is insane. Other people alsoo spend money on their outfits, have a teams of 20 people, spend money to get ready.\n\"They also stress out, but celebrities still think it’s more important for them to walk on the Red Carpet.\"",

    "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The New York Democratic congressional candidate running against GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik suggested \"MAGA\" supporters should attend a \"re-education camp\" after the 2024 election — even if Democrats see a \"resounding blue wave.\"\nPaula Collins, who is running against Stefanik, R-N.Y., in New York’s 21st congressional district, made the comments during a public Zoom Townhall this week, where she appeared to admit that \"re-education\" would be controversial.\n\"Even if we were to have a resounding blue wave come through, as many of us would like, putting it all back together again after we’ve gone through this MAGA nightmare and re-educating basically, which, that sounds like a rather, a re-education camp. I don’t think we really want call it that,\" she said during the Zoom townhall. \"I’m sure we can find another way to phrase it.\"\nSTEFANIK FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE, CITES DAUGHTER'S WORK FOR GROUP PROMOTING DEMS\nIn an email to Fox News Digital, Collins explained her comments.\n\"We currently have lawmakers, including Rep. Elise Stefanik, who mis-quote or mis-understand the law,\" Collins told Fox News Digital. \"Even if MAGA were to be resoundingly defeated, we would need to engage in widespread civics education, which both red and blue voters acknowledge has been slipping in recent years.\"\nCollins said \"the goal would be such that regular citizens could understand the process by which the state courts process matters, compared to the federal court circuit, and so forth.\"\n\"Rep. Elise Stefanik does not show a good understanding of the court structure in her home state of New York,\" Collins continued.\nCollins pointed to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case against former President Trump, in which he was found guilty on all counts of falsifying business records. Collins said that trial and the charges are \"a state matter, not a federal matter.\"\nCollins said Stefanik's \"outcry bespeaks a lack of basic civics education, as well as a basic lack of respect for the state supreme court system in her home State of New York.\"\nSOME FORMER 'NEVER TRUMP' VOTERS NOW SAY THEY'RE BACKING GOP NOMINEE AFTER HIS CONVICTION\n\"Similarly, many voters have misunderstandings and lack of regard for basic judicial systems that underscore the need for civics education,\" Collins said.\nSenior advisor to Elise Stefanik, Alex DeGrasse, however, said Collins' comments would be seen as offensive to many Republicans.\n\"This radical New York City Democrat Socialist who literally is renting a bed and breakfast room in NY-21 was caught on tape saying she wants to force Trump voters through ‘re-education camps,’\" he said. \"Everyone knows she will be defeated by Elise Stefanik by a historic margin.\"\nDeGrasse added that \"this is yet another reason by President Trump, Elise Stefanik, and voters in Upstate and across America will clean the Democrats’ clocks at the ballot box this November.\"\nDeGrasse was referring to Collins’ being from New York City. Collins has said that before the spring of 2024, she lived full time in New York City.\nCollins is a New York cannabis tax attorney.\nAccording to election documents, Collins is based out of her law office, the Law Office of Paula Collins, PLLC in New York City. She currently rents a room in a rental housing unit in Canton, N.Y. to claim residency in the district.\nCollins has never voted in the district.",

    "text": "Read full article Fox News Alexa, Carlos PenaVega felt 'supernatural peace' after losing baby: 'Don't know how people do it without God' Emily Trainham, Larry Fink June 2, 2024 at 11:30 AM · 6\nOops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nFaith has helped Alexa and Carlos PenaVega through an extremely tough time.\nThe couple, both actors who married in 2014 after meeting at Bible study, recently experienced a loss when their fourth child, a daughter they named Indy, was stillborn. As they explained to Fox News Digital, their religion played a huge part in helping them get through the tragedy.\n\"I don't know how people do it without God because we can't explain it other than it was like supernatural peace that didn't make sense,\" Alexa said. \"It doesn't make sense. It's beyond understanding. Because after it all happened, obviously we were devastated. It was heartbreaking. And yet we felt like God was just telling us, 'Hey, I am so sorry you had to go through this, but I am here for you, and I'm going to make a way for you.'\"\n‘SPY KIDS’ STAR ALEXA PENAVEGA ON LEAVING HOLLYWOOD FOR HAWAII, INSTILLING FAITH IN FAMILY\nCarlos PenaVega and Alexa PenaVega speak during an interview at the \"Mr. Manhattan\" screening at Kentucky Theater on May 22, 2024 in Lexington, Kentucky.\nShe continued, \"God didn't take our baby away. I think that's one of those things that, you know, things happen in life … just because you go through something bad, sometimes I hear people say like, 'I can't believe God let that happen.' I'm like, God didn't let that happen, but God is going to make a way for you to get through that.\"\n\"Just because the enemy throws fiery arrows at you doesn't mean that God isn't going to make a way. Like those arrows are still going to come at you, but he's going to provide shelter. He's going to help you with some shields. He's going to get you through the seasons. And he got us through that season.\"\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nWATCH: ALEXA AND CARLOS PENAVEGA'S FAITH HELPED THEM THROUGH FAMILY TRAGEDY\nOn April 15, Alexa and Carlos shared the news that she had a stillbirth . In a statement shared on both of their Instagram accounts, the couple wrote, \"There are never the right words to say when it comes to loss. After a beautiful and peaceful delivery our daughter ‘Indy’ was born at rest. It has been a painful journey. But in the pain we have found peace. God continues to comfort and hold us in his arms.\"\nIn the months before, they kept fans updated on her pregnancy. Indy was their fourth child, as they share sons Ocean, 7, and Kingston, 4, as well as daughter Rio, 2.\nCarlos told Fox News Digital that as for his specific experience, \"I think as a husband and as the leader of the household, you know, I had to kind of remain strong for the family. And I definitely had some weak moments in there.\"\nCarlos and Alexa PenaVega have been open about the loss of their baby.\nAlexa cut in to question his word choice, telling him that those moments were \"not weak,\" and he corrected himself, saying he had \"some very emotional moments.\"\nHe explained, \"I think I normally don't allow myself to go there. And because I did, it actually brought us a lot closer. And, you know, grieving is OK. Like, you know, I think as men we try and stay tough.\"\nThe actor, best known for starring in the Nickelodeon series \"Big Time Rush\" and for appearing in the band of the same name, stressed that \"it's OK to grieve, it's OK to be emotional.\"\nOne moment in the grieving process he said he would never forget happened when a friend and his wife called and left him a special voicemail days after the stillbirth.\nThey sung a worship song for him.\nCarlos and Alexa PenaVega have been married since 2014.\n\"No one's done that for me, ever,\" Carlos admitted. \"And just listening to the words … somebody would sit there for five minutes and sing this song for me. And I was literally, like, weeping, and I'll never forget that moment …\"\nAfter taking a brief moment to collect his thoughts, he said, \"It's hard to love people. Sometimes it's hard to love God. I guess it's like, why, why, why? But when can you just let go and just sit there and surrender and let the Holy Spirit take over and just let it … that moment for me will always, always be there forever. So it's OK to let go and let God.\"\nAlexa and Carlos have starred in a number of movies together, including Hallmark's \"Enchanted Christmas\" and \"Love in the Limelight.\" Their latest movie, \"Mr. Manhattan,\" premiered on Great American Pure Flix earlier this month.\n\"Honestly, we have so much fun working together,\" Carlos told Fox News Digital. \"And this time was just the same.\"\nWATCH: ALEXA AND CARLOS PENAVEGA SHARE DIFFICULT TIME DURING THE FILMING OF THEIR NEW MOVIE\nHe continued, \"I mean. I always feel like when you're doing something for the kingdom, doing something like, with faith , the enemy just attacks it and just wants it to take it down. And this movie definitely had its challenges. You know, we were filming in Kentucky … it was kind of just out of nowhere. Like here we are at Kentucky, at this university. We had a bunch of college students as the crew. So we were kind of showing them the ropes, and it ended up being such a fantastic experience.\"\n\"But it definitely had its challenges. And at the end, seeing the final result, it just made everything worth it for us.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Despite this, she said it was still a \"harder\" movie for them to make together.\nAlexa PenaVega and Carlos PenaVega met at Bible study.\n\"It was very hard,\" Carlos agreed, saying that there were \"about three days\" that they \"didn't really talk to each other\" after she gave him a suggestion about his acting. He blamed his ego for the argument, but she called it \"healthy conflict,\" which she said is important.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nAnother important thing for the couple is making movies like these, as Alexa said, \"I think … growing up, there were so many options [for movies] for us to watch as a family and as kids or as teenagers, and I really feel like what families have offered to them right now, it's not great. It really isn't. I think a lot of values are being lost. Kids are just exposed to some crazy stuff now, and we just want to bring back those feel-good movies.\"\nWATCH: ALEXA AND CARLOS PENAVEGA WANT TO BRING BACK MOVIES WITH VALUES\nBill Abbott, president and CEO of GAC Media, stepped in to discuss the film as well, telling Fox News Digital, \"This is really a dream movie for us with a dream couple. And, you know, we worked together a long time, and I'm just so thrilled that we're reunited and working together on a number of really exciting, thoughtful projects that are different from your typical rom-com.\"\nHe added, \"But at the same time, they offer viewers a terrific experience that combines everything faith, family, love, passion and there's no one more passionate or talented, quite frankly, than these two.\"\nOriginal article source: Alexa, Carlos PenaVega felt 'supernatural peace' after losing baby: 'Don't know how people do it without God'\nView comments",

    "text": "The building that houses video game company Raven Software is shown in Middleton, Wis. A group of quality assurance testers at the company have ratified their first union contract — more than three years after launching the first union at a major U.S. gaming studio. (M.P. King / Wisconsin State Journal)\nThe deal at Raven Software in Middleton affects video game testers, some of the industry’s lowest-paid workers. It caps a saga that included a strike and a purchase by Microsoft.\nBy Natalie Yahr\nWisconsin Watch\nThis story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by donors like you.\nVideo game testers at Middleton-based Raven Software have ratified their first union contract, more than three years after making local and national headlines by launching the first union at a major U.S. studio.\nRatified on Aug. 4, the contract gives employees a 10% raise while limiting mandatory overtime and preserving remote work options.\nThe deal is the latest development in a saga involving some of the video game industry’s lowest-paid workers. It comes after Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard, Raven Software’s parent company, leaving the roughly two dozen testers to negotiate with one of the world’s largest tech companies.\n“I think we pretty much got everything we aimed for,” said Erin Hall, a seven-year veteran at Raven and one of two workers who negotiated the contract. As a quality assurance tester, she checks for bugs in the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise and works with developers to fix them.\nAn Activision Blizzard spokesperson declined to comment but directed Wisconsin Watch to a web page discussing Microsoft’s labor principles.\nStudios nationwide employ testers to play new video games and identify problems before release.\nRaven’s testers make around $21 an hour, and they’re frequently required to work overtime in weeks-long “crunch time” stretches ahead of a game’s release. The volatile nature of their industry prompted the workers to organize.\nThe testers walked off the job to protest layoffs of a dozen colleagues in December 2021. They announced the formation of a union the next month — the first at a AAA studio that makes high-budget games. The Game Workers Alliance represents the workers, organized with support from Communications Workers of America.\nLessons from three years of negotiating\nFor Hall and fellow bargaining committee member Autumn Prazuch, contract negotiations required intensive lessons on bargaining and labor laws. Neither had joined a union before launching their own.\n“We had no idea it would be this difficult, or that it would take three-and-a-half years, or that it’d be this stressful, that we would be giving up so many nights and weekends,” Hall said. “We felt like it was the right thing to do, and we did it, and we learned as we went.”\nThe process took about twice as long as a norm that has grown longer in recent years. Newly unionized workers between 2020 to 2023 spent an average of 17 months negotiating their first contract, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis.\nThe contract negotiations overlapped with a change of ownership: Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard. In 2022, while waiting for regulators to approve the deal, Microsoft committed to remaining neutral on the workers’ unionization efforts.\nThat was after Activision took steps organizers called union busting, including withholding raises granted to nonunion workers and reorganizing Raven’s staff in what the union argued was an attempt to dilute its support ahead of the election.\nPrazuch said negotiating with leaders at Activision and Microsoft made her feel like “a little fish in a big pond.”\n“You’re sitting across from tech billionaires, and this is a huge company … and we’re 19 people at Raven QA in Middleton, Wisconsin,” she said.\nBut in that process, Prazuch discovered strengths she didn’t know she had.\n“I’ve learned that I have more determination than I initially thought, that my voice is louder than I thought it was,” Prazuch said.\nShe also learned that the same focus that helps her identify glitches in games allowed her to flag subtle wording changes that would shift the terms of the deal.\nThe deal they reached limits mandatory overtime to half the weeks in a quarter, and it gives testers the flexibility to choose their schedules when working overtime. Workers who currently work remotely can continue to do so under a contract that also promises 10% raises over the two-year contract period, with potential for additional raises.\nHall said she’d encourage other workers to start unions — if they’re in it for the long haul.\n“I would not want to take it back for anything, but it was really hard work,” Hall said. “If people want to unionize at their workplace, just know it’s going to be really difficult, and you have to be committed to seeing it through to the end.”\nMore video game workers are unionizing\nWhile Microsoft’s promise to not oppose employees’ union efforts contrasts with many other major companies, the process has still had moments of controversy. Communications Workers of America, for instance, criticized Microsoft this summer when it announced plans to lay off around 9,000 workers across the company. That included its gaming division, where it halted production of several games.\nRaven’s quality assurance team escaped those layoffs, along with a previous round, Hall said. Having a contract doesn’t guarantee the testers won’t be laid off, but it requires the company to offer notice and bargain over severance and benefits.\nKeith Fuller, a former Raven Software employee who is now a Madison-based workplace culture consultant, called collective bargaining “one of the few levers that game developers have” as video game companies tighten their belts and as the Trump administration redefines workers’ rights.\n“The power imbalance that’s inherent in capitalism shows up very easily in game development,” Fuller said. “I think that this is something that will benefit workers across the industry.”\nThe organizing trend comes as state lawmakers are exploring ways to encourage video game companies to move to Wisconsin or expand their in-state operations.\nIn the years since Raven workers unionized, workers at some other major studios have followed their lead. Communications Workers of America says it now represents 2,000 video game workers at Microsoft.\n“When we started (our union campaign), we were kind of ambitiously hoping that there’d be anyone that would do this too, and now there’s so many,” Hall said.",
