    "text": "Javier Aguirre asumirá nuevamente el banquillo de la selección mexicana. Jaime Lozano cerró su ciclo con El Tri sin lograr los resultados pretendidos. El “Vasco” llega nuevamente como la solución a los problemas del conjunto azteca, pero Ricardo Ferretti cuestionó el estima que hay sobre su colega.\nEl “Vasco” sería el líder del banquillo mexicano de cara al Mundial de 2026. El entrenador azteca viene de tener muy buenos resultados con el Mallorca del fútbol de España. Las expectativas son altas, pero el “Tuca” no se apresura ni considera que sea la opción idónea.\n“ Es un buen técnico, pero no de la magnitud que hablan (…) Con excepción del Atlético de Madrid, los otros equipos la verdad…”, dijo Ricardo Ferretti al hacer referencia a que Javier Aguirre no ha tenido una carrera prominente con clubes grandes del fútbol de Europa.\n'¿Cuál dupla? No existe…' 😳\nTuca Ferretti no concuerda con algunas ideas sobre lo de Javier Aguirre y Rafa Márquez.\n¡Disfruta Futbol Picante en #DisneyPlus ! 📺 pic.twitter.com/LM8MDmHnjf\n— Futbol Picante (@futpicante) July 24, 2024 El propio Ricardo Ferretti reveló que también tuvo contactos con los clubes a los que el “Vasco” dirigió. Sin embargo, al “Tuca” no le motivaba dirigir a equipos que lucharan en la mitad de tabla para abajo y cuyo objetivo era no descender.\n“No quiero ser presuntuoso ni nada, estos equipos me los ofrecieron más de 10 veces, ¿para qué? (…) ¿Pero para qué voy? Equipos del decimosegundo lugar para abajo que la única cosa es que no desciendo, no tengo aspiración de campeonatos “, agregó.\nFerretti cuestiona la dupla de Aguirre y Márquez El exentrenador de los Tigres de la UANL también cuestionó la filosofía de Javier Aguirre y Rafa Márquez. Ricardo Ferretti considera que son ideas de juego no compatibles que tendrán que adaptarse en el banquillo de la selección mexicana.\n“¿Cómo va a ser la combinación de un fútbol, no voy a decir arcaico, contra el barcelonismo que mantiene Rafa ? Y después le dijeron que era para el proceso 2026-2030, ahora lo imponen a un cuerpo técnico. ¿Cómo se sentirá Rafa impuesto en un cuerpo técnico?”, concluyó.\nLa experiencia de Javier Aguirre, la trayectoria de Rafa Márquez y el liderazgo probado a nivel mundial de ambos juntos en la Selección Nacional de México con miras al 2026 y en el Proyecto 2030. ¿Cómo no ilusionarnos?\n¡Bienvenidos! 🤝🏻 pic.twitter.com/A01JDNTgek\n— Selección Nacional (@miseleccionmx) July 22, 2024 Sigue leyendo:\n– El mexicano Antonio Portales levanta la mano para la selección mexicana\n– Luis Fernando Tena rechazó volver a la selección de México\n– Cuándo comienza la Leagues Cup, torneo que afecta a la Liga MX\n– Chicharito: cómo le ha ido a Javier Hernández en su regreso a Chivas",

    "title": "Govt adopted divisive tactics to sideline crucial issues: Sadhotra - DailyExcelsior",
    "text": "Excelsior Correspondent JAMMU Dec, 28: The Government at the Centre is employing divisive tactics to distract the public from pressing issues that demand immediate attention and resolution. This strategy, aimed at creating rifts among different sections of our society, is not only detrimental to the nation’s unity but also a clear indication of the Government’s inability to address core challenges. This was stated by Ajay Sadhotra, additional general secretary JKNC and former Minister while addressing a meeting of NC party workers of Nagrota Constituency at Sher-e-Kashmir Bhawan, Jammu. Provincial president JKNC, Jammu, Rattan Lal Gupta was also present. The meeting was presided over by Raghvir Singh Manhas District president Jammu Rural A JKNC, who apprised the senior functionaries about the problems being faced by the people of Nagrota Constituency with regard to shortage of basic amenities like scarcity of power and water supply, lack of healthcare faculties and civic amenities, etc. The senior NC leader emphasized that such actions are a deliberate attempt to divert attention from critical issues like economic downturns, unemployment, health crises, and educational reforms. He asserted that these issues are of paramount importance and require immediate and focused attention from both the Government and the public. By drawing attention away from these pivotal areas, he stated that the Government is not only neglecting its duty to address these concerns but also using divisive methods to distract the people, thereby undermining the democratic process and the overall welfare of the society. Sadhotra lamented that the development has come to a complete halt in Nagrota constituency under the incumbent proxy regime of Bharatiya Janata Party and the bureaucrat-centric administration is least bothered to address the iues othe common people in absence of a duly elected representative Government in place in this Union Territory. He asserted that the National Conference reaffirms its commitment to work towards a united and progressive India, where the welfare of every citizen is prioritized over political gains. Senior members Qazi Jalal, Sheikh Bashir Ahmed , Ayub Malik, Ankush. l Joint Secretary Jammu Province, Shahmim / Shamim Bwhus Begum DDC Dansal, Ch Rehmat Ali BDC Chairman, Kuldeep Sharma, Ghar Singh, Dr Vikas Sharma, Thoru Ram, Ajit Singh Manhas and others were also present.",

    "text": "Sweden officially joined the NATO alliance on Thursday, marking the end of a process that took nearly two years.\nSweden will become the 32nd member of NATO, joining the U.S., U.K., and a host of other European Union nations, after facing holdouts from members like Hungary and Turkey. Sweden’s new membership marks another blow against Russia, which has been hoping to prevent the eastbound expansion of NATO.\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson transferred the necessary documentation to Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to officially seal the deal,\naccording to Axios.\n“Sweden is now a NATO member. Thank you all Allies for welcoming us as the 32nd member,” Kristersson\nsaid on Thursday. “We will strive for unity, solidarity, and burden-sharing, and will fully adhere to the Washington Treaty values: freedom, democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. Stronger together.”\nThe White House welcomed Sweden’s membership on Thursday.\nToday, I am honored to welcome Sweden as NATO’s 32nd Ally.\n75 years ago when NATO was established, President Truman said the Alliance, “would create a shield against aggression and fear of aggression.”\nThat shield – and transatlantic security – is stronger than ever.\n[pic.twitter.com/0ySHg8dvQy]\n— President Biden (@POTUS)\n[March 7, 2024]\n“I am honored to welcome Sweden as NATO’s 32nd Ally,” President Joe Biden said in a\nstatement. “When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could weaken Europe and divide NATO… With the addition of Sweden today, NATO stands more united, determined, and dynamic than ever — now 32 nations strong.”\nSweden had faced several obstacles during its ascension process.\nTurkey initially\nblocked Sweden’s bid but agreed to approve it in July at the prospect of being transferred $20 billion worth of U.S. F-16 fighter jets. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban held out on approving Sweden’s bid for over a year, citing poor relations between the countries, but dropped the hold in February after “rebuilding trust” — and after Sweden approved the transfer of four Gripen fighter jets to Hungary.\nAll republished articles must include our logo, our reporter’s byline, and their DCNF affiliation.

    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "> I hate to give Mel Gibson any praise or a compliment of any kind these days, but the guy knows how to direct a movie. As displayed in the trailer for this movie, he’s given us such classics as “Braveheart,” “Apocalypto” and “Hacksaw Ridge” — all historical epics with huge casts, complex action scenes and singular protagonists on personal quests.\nSo why is he directing “Flight Risk,” a 90-minute movie almost entirely set on a small plane with a cast of three? Those parameters don’t play into any of his strengths behind the camera, which leads me to think he didn’t have another choice but to direct whatever the studio gave him. Given that his name is all but box office poison in Hollywood, it’s no wonder they kept his name off all the marketing, replacing it with the aforementioned, “From the director of…”\nNevertheless, this film mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. Unfortunately, the bar is set embarrassingly low, feeling more like a way for everyone involved to pay off a car loan, keep their union benefits or settle a debt with a producer. I hate to say it, but without Gibson at the helm, it could have crashed and burned a lot sooner.\nU.S. Marshal Madelyn Harris (Michelle Dockery) has arrested accountant Winston (Topher Grace), who was hiding out in a remote part of Alaska after turning informant against his mob boss employer. With Winston ready to cooperate, the two need to get back to the lower 48 states so he can testify in court.\nChartering a small private plane to take them to Anchorage, Madelyn and Winston are being transported by Daryl Booth (Mark Wahlberg), a Texan living in Alaska. With their 90-minute flight mostly over the Alaskan wilderness, it is soon revealed that Daryl is a hitman Winston’s former employer hired to take out the accountant before the plane returns to civilization.\nIf that initial premise sounds good to you, you’re in for a promising opening half hour that makes the most of it. Because of course Madelyn and Winston don’t know that Daryl is actually there to do more than fly the plane, and he seems pretty normal at first. But as the flight continues and the cop and accountant start to figure it out, the tension is genuinely great.\nThat’s mostly due to the main trio all show up and do the best they can with a lacking script. The first person we’re introduced to is Winston, and Grace is nearly non-stop with the quips and sarcasm, something he’s always excelled in. When faced with only three possibilities — death by Wahlberg, death by plane crash or life in prison — he’s got nothing left to lose and lets the sassy remarks roll.\nAnd then we meet Madeyln, the straight man to Winston’s comic relief. And while she is mostly all business, her backstory is slowly revealed throughout the flight, demonstrating the why and the how of the whole situation. True, it’s all clichés we’ve heard and seen a hundred times before, but it also allows Dockery to do some pretty awesome and heroic stuff.\nMeanwhile, Wahlberg, who rarely plays an unredeemable villain, is having the most fun of the three. Putting on a fake Texan accent that his native Boston accent can barely handle and actually shaving part of his head are the most obvious ways he gets into character, but there are plenty of uncomfortable lines and physical acting moments that he pulls off throughout.\nAnd that’s where the goodwill ends because even at 90 minutes the premise feels stretched. Thanks to a couple of ex machina solutions, the story continues with situations and conversations between the three passengers repeated again and again, and the characters are two-dimensional at best.\nThe action is predictable and the special effects work is shockingly cheap. Whether a moose who looks more like Bullwinkle than a live animal or shots of scenic Alaska that the local tourism board would turn down, it isn’t pretty. Stuck in a plane cabin 20 feet long and six feet wide, there’s only so much you can do, and Gibson finds it all shortly after takeoff. Buckle in.",
