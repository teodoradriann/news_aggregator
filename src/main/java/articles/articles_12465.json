    "title": "Northland’s Wild Kiwi back with new trophy for schools - NZ Herald",
    "text": "One of Northland’s toughest multisport events is on again this weekend, with a new trophy on offer for schools.\nThe Northpower Wild Kiwi is being held at Whangārei Heads on Saturday with hundreds of competitors due to take part.\nThe Wild Kiwi Multisport is for teams or individuals (from 14 years and up) and comprises a 10km sea kayak, 25km mountain bike ride and 14km run to the finish line. Run/walk events include 8km, 15km and half-marathon (21km) options.\nNorthlander Mel Leahy likes the idea of a challenge and that’s why she has been driving some good-natured banter between Whangārei Heads and Parua Bay Primary schools.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. This year will see the two schools compete for a new trophy for the first time. The inaugural school competition is open to all students, past students, teachers and parents, with the total points for each school calculated by adding up the best 10 individual scores on Saturday.\nThe winning school will be the one with the lowest total score when all 10 scores are added together and the trophy will be presented at prizegiving on event day.\nEntrants running as part of a school team are still eligible for individual placings, but regardless of who takes out the trophy, for Leahy, the Northpower Wild Kiwi is about families being outdoors and being active.\n“Events like these aren’t just about placing, they are about starting and finishing in a great environment whether you are taking part with family or friends. It’s a wholesome, quality atmosphere with good people,” she said.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. Come Saturday, Leahy will be teaming up with her daughter Caoimhe and her friend Madison Macmillan – both Year 8 students at Pompallier Catholic College – to tackle the 15km run/walk.\nTotal Sport’s Mark Fordham said more than 700 contestants are registered for Northland’s premier multisport event but his ultimate aim of attracting 1000 entrants to the Whangārei Heads event remains.\n“The Northpower Wild Kiwi has become a landmark multisport event in Te Tai Tokerau in recent years because it is a family-friendly occasion, with plenty of distances to choose from and, for the second year, a 1km kids dash for the youngsters will be a highlight,” Fordham said.\n“Total Sport’s drive is to encourage more Kiwis to get active and outdoors. Having a multitude of events at the Northpower Wild Kiwi provides something for everyone. We see the Mild Kiwi as the ideal introduction to multisport that can be tackled in a team or individually.”\nNorthpower’s general manager of people and capability Andrea O’Brien said more than 100 Northpower staff from multiple offices between Wellington and Northland will compete this year.\nNorthpower began encouraging staff to enter off-road events in 2018 as a way of improving wellbeing and staff, their whānau and friends have embraced the opportunity, particularly amongst the stunning scenery the Northpower Wild Kiwi courses cover in Whangārei Heads.\nTo find out more, visit www.thewildkiwi.co.nz",

    "text": "Finally, mother nature has turned on the faucet and the snow is arriving at ski resorts in Idaho after a dismal December. \"Any time we can talk about snow in terms of feet instead of inches we are in a happy place,\" said April Whitney of Brundage. Ski resorts like Brundage took a little bit of a hit during the holiday season when they had to rely on snowmaking to open the mountain, but that is changing as Brundage has received 25 inches in the last week and there's more on the way ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. \"We would have loved to have this snow for the winter break, but there is nothing we can do to change the past,\" said Whitney. \"Having all this snow come in right before the three day weekend is huge these are the kind of conditions people think of when they think of Brundage Mountain.\" The snow was fantastic on Wednesday with fresh powder to be had on every turn. The snow was soft making it easy to cruise because if you have been skiing this year you know icy conditions have been the norm. \"It finally came,\" said snowboarder Guy Jeppe. \"It’s just knee deep out here, it’s a lot of fun.\" Hopefully this will start an epic turnaround this winter as people still need to be aware of early season conditions, but the snow also gives the crew at Brundage a chance to get to work to groom runs and open the rest of the mountain. \"This storm is a game changer on the mountain for sure,\" said Whitney. \"This amount of snow makes it a more productive task to prep the slopes and it is really going to pay off with more terrain being open.\" It's going to be a good weekend up at Brundage as we could feel the stoke in the middle of the week from skiers and snowboarders. \"Brundage is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen, I love Brundage,\" said Jade Root. \"The powder is just excellent here and the snow is amazing coming down the hill,\" responded Hunter Fitzgerald.",

The newly appointed CEO, Leonard Achan introduced a comprehensive strategic plan which achieved a greater than 50% increase in organ donation, resulting in saving thousands of lives.\nLiveOnNY also focused on community outreach – debunking myths and misconceptions, educating and engaging the public – which has resonated strongly with diverse populations, achieving greater than 60% of donors representing Black, Asian, Hispanic and multiracial populations of the NY Metro region. In addition, approximately 60% of staff and leadership represent Black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, and multiracial individuals. By embracing diversity in race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, culture, thoughts, and ideas, LiveOnNY has fostered a supportive workplace and continues to achieve record-breaking success in saving more lives than ever before.\nThe culmination of LiveOnNY's turnaround strategy earned the organization this unparalleled level of performance, professionalism, and employee satisfaction that is witnessed in this Crain's Best Place to Work in NYC award.\n\"LiveOnNY is honored to be named a Crain's Best Place to Work for the third consecutive year. LiveOnNY's people are the backbone of our success, and this accolade would not be possible without their relentless dedication. We are equally grateful to our generous donor heroes and their families, whose selflessness and grace fuels our mission. LiveOnNY has become one of the top-performing OPOs in the nation because of our extraordinary team, and we remain committed to honoring our communities and our donor heroes every day,\" said LiveOnNY President and CEO Leonard Achan, RN, MA, ANP.\nTo determine the final list of the best companies, Crain's conducted an anonymous third-party survey of all LiveOnNY employees aimed at the experiences and attitudes of employees with respect to their workplace.
