Ciudad de México tiene un amanecer como de película Este martes 2 de enero la Ciudad de México tuvo un [amanecer](https://www.record.com.mx/contra/que-frio-pronostican-que-seguiran-las-bajas-temperaturas-y-heladas-en-la-ciudad-de-mexico) especialmente espectacular en colores rojizos y amarillos, el cual no pasó desapercibido por varios capitalinos que a través de [redes sociales](https://www.record.com.mx/contra) compartieron fotografías y videos que capturaron con sus celulares. A pesar de que autoridades había alertado sobre un amanecer con bajas temperaturas y heladas a lo largo y ancho de las 16 alcaldías que componen la capital, el despertar en este segundo día del año ofreció un paisaje increíble. Por ello, varios capitalinos aprovecharon la escena como de película para sacar sus celulares y retratar el cielo que lucía con tonos rojos, amarillos y azules. “Un regalo para la mirada; qué belleza de amanecer nos obsequia hoy Iztacalco, Ciudad de México”, fue el mensaje de un usuario en X, antes Twitter, con el que acompañó una espectacular fotografía de las primeras horas de este día.

    "text": "The US and other allies shouldn’t wait till February. They should instead move ahead immediately. Ukraine needs all the weapons and supplies it can get as quickly as possible. There is no reason to wait. Indeed, waiting will just unnecessarily prolong the war and associated suffering, enabling the Russian military to commit more atrocities and war crimes, as the Ukrainians run low on munitions. [It’s certainly a better alternative than sending them Western assets, which I do support but in the context of a more cohesive plan with much better oversight on use. However, it would be a one-time move, would likely lead to confiscatory retaliation in Russia and elsewhere, and could undermine confidence in the US rule of law over financial matters. Somin addresses those concerns in [a separate post](https://reason.com/volokh/2023/11/17/fund-ukraines-war-effort-by-confiscating-russian-government-assets/), so be sure to check that out as well. I’d argue that this still needs more discussion than less. — Ed]",

    "title": "El hábito de alimentación muy común que arruina la piel y provoca la caída del pelo",
    "text": "Para que nuestro cuerpo esté en buen estado es fundamental seguir hábitos de alimentación saludable y realizar actividad física. También es imprescindible detectar y eliminar las comidas nocivas. Existe un hábito nocivo y muy frecuente que cometemos y perjudica el estado de la piel y el pelo. Se trata del consumo excesivo de azúcares, sobre todo del tipo refinado. “Este es uno de los alimentos que más influyen en el envejecimiento de nuestra piel y nuestro cabello”, explica la nutricionista y farmacéutica Paula Martín Clares, sobre este punto La razón: un proceso conocido como glicación. El sitio especializado Deutsche Farma explica que en términos dermatológicos se denomina así a la reacción espontánea de la glucosa sanguínea con las fibras dérmicas del colágeno y la elastina. Los productos resultantes de la glicación se acumulan tanto dentro como fuera de las células y se unen a las proteínas de la membrana plasmática, circulantes y estructurales; acelerando el proceso de envejecimiento de la piel. “Cuando tenemos altos niveles de glucosa en sangre, se da una reacción espontánea de la glucosa sanguínea con las fibras dérmicas de colágeno y elastina. En otras palabras, cuando hay demasiado azúcar en nuestras fibras cutáneas el cuerpo reacciona”, agrega Clares en la edición española del sitio Womens Health Mag. Cómo regular el consumo de azúcar en nuestra alimentación El azúcar está en muchos de los alimentos que consumimos, desde las frutas y las verduras hasta las bebidas. Para reducir su consumo, pueden seguirse las siguientes recomendaciones: - Evitar en lo posible los alimentos procesados, ya que suelen contener más azúcares que los alimentos frescos. - Leer con atención las etiquetas de los alimentos envasados. Muchos de ellos tienen azúcar agregada para lograr un mejor sabor. - Beber más agua y restringir las cantidad de bebidas azucaradas, como gaseosas o jugos industrializados. - Reducir o evitar el consumo de lactosa. Preferir en cambio las leches deslactosadas y los quesos bajos en lactosa, como el suizo o el queso feta. - Al realizar postres caseros, sustituir el azúcar refinada por dátiles, compota de manzana u otras opciones naturales.",

    "text": "‘I failed.’ NC camp counselor didn’t complete thorough checks before boy’s death WBTV Investigates: New state report reveals details leading up to 12-year-old’s death LAKE TOXAWAY (WBTV) – A new report released by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reveals new details about the events leading up to the death of a 12-year-old boy at a therapeutic wilderness camp in the western part of the state. The boy died in early February, less than a day after arriving at Trails Carolina, which bills itself as a therapeutic wilderness camp for troubled children. The camp has been [effectively shut down since late February](https://www.wbtv.com/2024/03/28/nc-dhhs-revoke-trails-carolinas-license/), with state regulators extending the ban on new admissions at the camp in late March following an inspection. Findings from that inspection—along with a response from the camp’s administrators—were released in a new report on Monday. State regulators cited the camp for failing to properly administer medications to campers, failing to let them send and receive letters without review by staff, failing to provide campers a safe and comfortable place to sleep, and failing to properly monitor campers overnight. A bulk of the report focuses on the events and circumstances leading up to the 12-year-old boy’s death in early February. Previous: [‘Shame on you.’ Former participants weigh in on NC wilderness camp](https://www.wbtv.com/2024/02/22/shame-you-former-participants-weigh-nc-wilderness-camp/) According to the report, four staff members were working in the boy’s cabin the night he died. Based on details in the report, each of the staff members had been in their current roles for less than a year. All of the staff members slept through the night with the participants, according to the report, but one staff member was responsible for wake up throughout the night to check on the boy, who was sleeping locked in bivy—a small sleeping bag-tent hybrid. The N.C. DHHS report quotes from the staff member’s interview with criminal investigators. According to the report, the staff member told investigators that he couldn’t see the boy through the bivy. Instead, the report said, the staff member relied on the fact that he claimed to be able to hear breathing coming from inside. “I didn’t check as thoroughly as I should have,” the staffer reportedly told investigators. “My actions that night was to perform night checks… that was my responsibility, which I failed on.” The staff member also added that he did “feel like the bivy had a lot to do with” the boy’s death. A second staff member “nodded and answered ‘yes’ to the question, do you think he suffocated,” according to the report. In response to each of the deficiencies cited by regulators, staff at Trails Carolina pointed out that nearly every deficiency cited was something that had been previously approved by N.C. DHHS regulators. A spokeswoman for Trails Carolina issued the following statement: “We believe the DHHS Report of Deficiencies is inaccurate and misleading in many respects, and we continue to work with State officials to clarify and correct where needed. In fact, just yesterday, April 23, 2024, we met with DHHS staff in person, and walked them through basic camping lexicon and systems, which, by their admission, they did not previously understand. Most importantly, the cause of death has yet to be released by the medical examiner, and, in the meantime, statements by anyone beyond those with authority and direct access to specifics of the autopsy are nothing more than speculation.” A spokeswoman for N.C. DHHS issued the following statement: “The recent investigation of Trails Carolina by DHHS’ Division of Health Service Regulation (DHSR) identified a number of serious and concerning issues that are documented in the Statement of Deficiencies dated 3/21/2024. Our investigation resulted in an intent to revoke Trails Carolina’s license, a suspension of admissions, and penalties totaling $18,000.” “An informal conference was held yesterday with Trails Carolina, at their request. DHSR staff will make a final decision regarding the organization’s license in the coming weeks. We are unable to provide further comment based on the ongoing investigation.” “DHSR believes that no one should be harmed while receiving care in a licensed healthcare facility and takes seriously its role to investigate complaints about care and, when necessary, takes appropriate actions against a licensed facility that has caused such harm.” WBTV has been [investigating Trails Carolina since 2021](https://www.wbtv.com/2021/05/24/its-beyond-cruel-inside-nc-wilderness-therapy-program-teens/) and has talked with a half-dozen campers who have detailed allegations of abuse and neglect while at the camp.

    "text": "Another set of exciting Bowl Games is on tap for College Football fans as this season has been quite a special one. Launched in November 2023, the ESPN BET promo code brings an entirely new way to enjoy Bowl Game action with a generous sports betting bonus.\nThursday’s slate of games boasts four intriguing matchups, and while users have multiple ways to wager, there are two picks we especially like. First-time bettors on ESPN BET can click the linked offers on this page and enter promo code AJC to score a $250 bonus when they make any of the best bets for today’s College Football Bowl Games.\nBest bets for today’s Bowl Games on the ESPN BET app (Dec. 28) Thursday’s slate of CFB Bowl Games features four terrific matchups to wager on using all the best gambling apps . The action begins with #17 SMU (-10) vs. Boston College (+10) in the Fenway Bowl at 11:00 am EST. At 2:15 pm EST, the Pinstripe Bowl hosts a matchup of Rutgers (-2.5) vs. Miami (+2.5). Next up is the Pop-Tarts Bowl at 5:45 with NC State (+2.5) vs. Kansas State (-2.5) unfortunately, North Carolina online sports betting did not launch in time for this game. And finally, Arizona (-2.5) vs. Oklahoma (+2.5) in the Alamo Bowl at 9:15 pm EST.\nNorth Carolina State (9-3) vs. Kansas State (8-4) - Pop-Tarts Bowl Team Point Spread Over-Under Total Moneyline NC State +2.5 (-115) Over 47.5 (-105) +110 Kansas State -2.5 (-105) Under 47.5 (-115) -130 The Pop-Tarts Bowl kicks off at 5:45 pm EST, live from Camping World Stadium in Orlando, FL, and features an awesome matchup between the NC State Wolfpack and the Kansas State Wildcats. While both teams enter the game with a nearly identical record, they have been disproportionally affected by opt-outs and the transfer portal.\nKansas State will play today’s game without the services of starting quarterback Will Howard, who has entered the transfer portal. The Wildcats will also be without their top pass catchers Phillip Brooks and Ben Sinnot (NFL Draft preparations), as well as their top cornerback Will Lee III and starting safety Kobe Savage, who transferred to Texas A&M and Oregon respectively. It’s also worth mentioning that Kansas State’s offensive coordinator, Colin Klein, has departed the program. In their stead, the Wildcats will be trotting out true freshman QB Avery Johnson, and calling the plays will be the newly promoted assistant coach Conor Riley.\nNC State will have the services of their starting signal-caller, Brennan Armstrong, who finished the season strong and will look to carry that momentum into this Bowl Game. On paper, this matchup looks like it could be a big game for the Wolfpack’s leading receiver, Kevin Concepcion. The true freshman emerged as a playmaker in the second half of the season and NC State got him involved in multiple ways averaging better than 50 yards rushing across his last four contests. Now facing a defense that will be without two key starters on the back end, Concepcion and the Wolfpack offense could feast today.\nWith the Wildcats missing so many important pieces from their 8-4 season, and NC State being largely unaffected by opt-outs and the transfer portal, the Wolfpack +2.5 feels like a smart bet in this spot.\nPick: NC State +2.5 (-115)\nArizona (9-3) vs. Oklahoma (10-2) - Alamo Bowl Team Point Spread Over-Under Total Moneyline Arizona -2.5 (-110) Over 59.5 (-110) -135 Oklahoma +2.5 (-110) Under 59.5 (-110) +115 At 9:15 pm EST it’s the Alamo Bowl, live from the Alamodome in San Antonio, TX. This Bowl Game plays host to the Arizona Wildcats vs. the Oklahoma Sooners, in a matchup that could prove to be an exciting one. And while the Sooners enter the game with an impressive 10-2 record, they will be without starting quarterback Dillon Gabriel who has transferred to Oregon, and former offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby who departed the program for the head coaching job at Mississippi State.\nThat sets up freshman Jackson Arnold to lead Brent Venables’ squad against an Arizona team that earned a 9-3 record good enough for a 3rd place finish in the Pac 12′s final season. The Wildcats will have their QB under center, as Noah Fifita has been everything Arizona fans could’ve asked for, winning Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year after taking over for Jayden de Laura.\nFinishing the season with 23 Touchdowns and only five Interceptions, Fifita should be set for a big day through the air as he faces an Oklahoma Sooners defense that ranked 97th in the country against the pass allowing over 240 yards per game. While the Sooners defense did improve over the second half of the season, it struggled mightily against top passing attacks including Kansas, Oklahoma State, and Texas.\nGiven the state of flux for the Oklahoma program vs. the growing confidence and ability of Arizona’s young offensive maestro, the Wildcats -2.5 is the play to make here.\nPick: Arizona -2.5 (-110)\n*Odds provided by ESPN BET\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution is not an online gambling operator or gambling site.

    "text": "MANALAPAN, Fla. — The smashing success of the 4 Nations Face-Off replacing All-Star festivities with a compelling, competitive international tournament has the NHL rethinking what to do next February before players go to the Milan Olympics .\nThe league announced 13 months ago that the Islanders would host All-Star Weekend in early February 2026, and commissioner Gary Bettman envisioned it as the ideal jumping off point for the Olympians to board planes for Italy. What that looks like, or when, is now up in the air.\n“We’re reevaluating how we want to do things because I think we’ve raised the bar about as high as you can for an all-star game in any sport,” Bettman said Wednesday at his news conference wrapping up the general managers' annual spring meeting. “And so we want to make sure whatever we do is up to the standards that we’ve created.”\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up Putting aside unforeseen circumstances like the pandemic, postponing or canceling a marquee event is not something the league is known to do. Asked about a different format or even shifting the event at UBS Arena to 2027, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly multiple times said, “Everything’s on the table.”\nRelated : Jeremy Swayman met his ‘goalie partner’ on a Halloween visit to Mass. General. On Monday, the pair reunited at TD Garden. Advertisement\nDaly added that a decision must be made “relatively soon” — at least before the playoffs begin April 19. An Islanders spokesperson deferred comment to the league office.\nNHL players are participating in the Olympic men’s hockey tournament for the first time since 2014, and there was not an All-Star Weekend then or in 2010 or ’06. The last time the league did both was 2002.\nNo rule changes NHL GMs spent a lot of time looking at video reviews, specifically coach’s challenges for goaltender interference, but Bettman confirmed that no rule changes are being considered for next season.\n“Three days of discussion about the game, no rule changes, which gives you a pretty good indication that the managers are certainly comfortable, if not more than pleased, with the current state of the game,” Bettman said.\nAfter trying out 10-minute three-on-three overtime at the 4 Nations, there’s no consideration to asking the players about going to that full time.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m not a fan of the extended overtime because of ice conditions and the wear and tear on the players who would be playing the additional five minutes, and I worry about that in injuries,” Bettman said.\nDaly confirmed the 2025-26 season will begin Oct. 7.\nPlayoff format Bettman for quite some time has shut down the idea of expanding the Stanley Cup playoffs beyond the 16-team tournament that has existed for decades, even as the NBA, NFL, and Major League Baseball tweaked their formats. That has not changed.\n“I like exactly what we have, and if you look at the races that we’re having for the regular season, playoffs have started already,” Bettman said. ”We’re in our play-in tournament, and I think it’s terrific.”\nRelated : Predators to face Penguins in Stockholm in November as part of the NHL’s Global Series LA draft The draft at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on June 27 and 28 will be the first to be decentralized, with team front offices at home or any location they choose but not in person to make picks. Teams voted 26-6 in favor of abandoning the centralized format to go to a model similar to what the NFL and NBA use, though GMs may be getting some cold feet about the decision.\n“This is what the clubs said they wanted,” Bettman said. “If there’s a desire to go back because the clubs miss each other, miss being on the floor together, we’ll put it back to a vote again. We can be flexible.”\nChanging landscape Some big changes are coming to hockey’s development pipeline, with the NCAA making a landmark change to its eligibility rules that allows Canadian junior players to compete at US colleges, as long as they are not paid more than actual and necessary expenses as part of that participation.\nAdvertisement",
