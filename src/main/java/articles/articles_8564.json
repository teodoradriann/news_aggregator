    "text": "NEW DELHI: City doctors extracted a 2-cm-long bullet from the left lung of a 45-year-old farmer who was shot 16 years ago following a personal dispute at his hometown in Kanpur.\nThe bullet, lodged perilously close to his heart, remained stuck in his lung since 2008, causing no major issues until recently.\nFor the past year, Singh experienced severe chest pain and began coughing up blood, symptoms that grew progressively worse. A CT scan had revealed the bullet’s location, along with a collapsed lung. Despite consulting several specialists over the years, the dangerous location of the bullet near vital organs had prevented earlier surgery.\nAs Singh’s condition became much worse, he was taken in by a Saket hospital.\n“Such cases are rare, but when a long-standing bullet starts causing life-threatening bleeding, immediate surgery becomes necessary,” said Max Hospital’s Dr Shaiwal Khandelwal, who led the operation, removing both the bullet and the damaged part of Singh’s lung.\nDoctors caution that bullets lodged near vital organs can cause complications over time, even after years without symptoms, as in Singh’s case where the bullet triggered life-threatening issues.\n“However, if left untreated, these bullets may cause foreign body reactions and may migrate and invade the vital structures as has happened with this patient,” Khandelwal said.\nBullet’s precarious location\nCT scan revealed the bullet’s location, along with a collapsed lung. Despite consulting specialists over the years, the dangerous location of the bullet near vital organs prevented earlier surgery attempts",

    "text": "SEATTLE — A beloved waterfront café in Seattle is celebrating 25 years in business.\nAgua Verde Café at the University of Washington opened in 1998 with a handful of tables and a New Mexican menu.\nThese days, it can seat more than 100 guests and serves authentic Mexican cuisine.\nBut one thing has never changed: the view of Portage Bay.\n\"You see the houseboats right across, you see the University Bridge going up and down, you see crew boats going by, you see seaplanes flying down,” said owner Travis Rosenthal. “It's a really special spot.”\nLong before he owned the café, he was a customer and fan.\n“I lived across the water when I first moved to Seattle in the late '90's and used to kayak over here and loved Agua Verde for years, and then had the opportunity to purchase it in 2019,” Rosenthal said.\nHis first move as owner? Making sure the long-time staff remained. Some employees have worked at Agua since the beginning.\nSergio Gaytan Martinez started as a busser when he was 15 years old.\n\"I'm the general manager for the café,” Gaytan Martinez said. “I honestly never thought I'd be in these shoes and it's been an incredible journey… (The staff is) truly my family and I don't know what I would do without Agua.\"\nRosenthal did make some changes to the restaurant itself. He ripped out a wall and built a new bar with views of the water.\nSeating expanded to the lower level in an outdoor area with a food truck called the Marina Cantina.\nDuring the pandemic, they developed canned cocktails for to-go orders.\nThe menu was also revamped to feature more fresh and elevated options, including tortilla made from scratch.\nChef Rogelio Reynoso was passionate about making authentic tortillas using Mexican heirloom corn. The corn is flown in, ground down and formed into fresh tortillas every day.\n\"There really is a difference,” Rosenthal said.\nSummer is the café’s busiest time, but UW faculty and students are steady customers during the colder months. Gaytan Martinez said some regulars are generations of the same families.\n\"It's almost cliche, but it's home,” he said. \"That's the kind of experience that Agua provides, it's just that home base.\"\nAgua Verde Café is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner (no reservations, walk-in only.) Marina Cantina is open Monday – Friday from 5 p.m. – closing, and Saturday – Sunday from noon – closing. Both are located at 1303 NE Boat Street. Street parking is nearby, and there are two boat slips for customers who come via Portage Bay.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",

Compartir Un año más, la Escuela Municipal de Deportes de Valverde de Leganés ha vuelto a organizar la ruta de 'Los malos augurios', que, a pesar del frió, recorrió parte de la localidad y sus alrededores en un gran ambiente navideño. Esta actividad tuvo que ser aplazada ya que tenía previsto celebrarse una semana antes, pero las condiciones climatológicas obligaron a su aplazamiento. Finalmente fue celebrada el pasado miércoles y los participantes pudieron disfrutar de un ameno paseo de unos siete kilómetros, que transcurrió por diferentes calles del municipio y algunos de los parajes más destacados de los alrededores. Como de costumbre, en una de las paradas realizadas aprovecharon para hacer la lumbre y tirar los malos augurios de cara al año nuevo. Fue una gran jornada deportiva y navideña, en la que los participantes llevaron tuvieron que entregar alimentos no perecederos para poder participar, contribuyendo así con la campaña solidaria de las navidades.

    "title": "Archbishop of Canterbury honoured for personal service during King’s Coronation",
    "text": "The King has personally honoured the Archbishop of Canterbury by making him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in recognition of his prominent role in the Coronation .\nThe Most Rev Justin Welby receives the award and is recognised together with others who helped to make the Coronation such a success , including the Crown Jeweller and the Master of the King’s Music.\nIt comes months after the Archbishop was criticised by Government ministers for using a speech in the House of Lords to criticise the Illegal Migration Bill . Tory MPs urged him to “stick to religion and keep out of politics”.\nAwards under the RVO are in the King’s gift and bestowed independently of Downing Street, which controls the main part of the New Year Honours list. The RVO was established by Queen Victoria to recognise distinguished personal service to the monarch or other members of the Royal family.\nThe Archbishop, who anointed and crowned the King during the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on May 6, will not be known as Sir Justin because the award is not technically a knighthood.\nA BBC documentary screened on Boxing Day gave an insight into the preparations for the Coronation , showing the King and Archbishop rehearsing together and sharing a joke.\nThe King was shown laughing and shaking his head when the Archbishop forgot his words at one point, and the Archbishop said later: “I have a memory that is probably about as good as our spaniel’s – in other words, zero.”\nThe Archbishop followed the longstanding tradition of commissioning a new Coronation liturgy – the prayers and actions of the Coronation service – which had the theme Called To Serve.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury will not be known as Sir Justin because the award is not technically a knighthood Credit : GARETH FULLER/PA But his GCVO, as the award is known, may prove controversial with those who believe he has strayed too far into politics in recent months.\nIn May he made a speech in the House of Lords in which he said the Government’s immigration policy – aimed at stopping small boats crossing the Channel – “ignores the reality that global migration must be engaged with at source as well as in the Channel as if we as a country were unrelated to the rest of the world”.\nRobert Jenrick, the then immigration minister, said at the time that he was “wrong on both counts”. The Conservative MP James Daly, a member of the home affairs committee, responded at the time by saying: “The unelected Archbishop should stick to religion and keep out of politics. He moralises but comes up with no solutions… the Government was democratically elected to implement policies like this.”\nIt was just the latest in a series of controversies involving the Archbishop’s public opposition to Government policies including Brexit, austerity and benefit caps.\nIn February this year the heads of several branches of the Anglican Church in foreign countries said they no longer recognised the Archbishop as head of the Church because of the General Synod’s decision to allow same sex marriages and civil partnerships to be blessed in churches.\nThe RVOs are part of the wider New Year Honours and named among the recipients was Claire van Straubenzee , the mother of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex’s late friend Henry van Straubenzee, who was killed in a 2002 car crash.\nOthers personally honoured by the King include Dr David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, who officiated during the Coronation , delivering St Edward’s Crown to the Archbishop. He has been made a Knight Commander of the RVO while his colleague Paul Baumann, Westminster Abbey’s receiver-general, equivalent to a chief executive, was made a Lieutenant of the RVO.\nMaintenance of the Crown Jewels Also made a Lieutenant is Mark Appleby, the Crown Jeweller, who is responsible for the maintenance of the Crown Jewels and was seen during the Coronation handing them from the altar at Westminster Abbey to those officiating. He is only the 10th person to hold the title since it was created in 1843\nSir Antonio Pappano, the Royal Opera House’s music director, who conducted the Coronation orchestra, is made a Commander of the RVO, and Colonel Jeremy Bagshaw, who in his former role as chief of staff at Army Headquarters London District oversaw the ceremonial role of the Household Division during the event, becomes a Lieutenant.\nThe main New Year Honours list, which is approved by the King on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, recognises the contribution to the Coronation of Judith Weir, Master of the King’s Music, with a damehood.\nShe composed a new piece, called Brighter Visions Shine Afar, that was performed as an overture at the Coronation. Dame Judith also wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022.\nClaire van Straubenzee, the mother of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex’s late friend Henry van Straubenzee, receives an MBE.\nMrs van Straubenzee co-founded a memorial fund named after her son, who was killed in a 2002 car crash, and which is supported by the two princes as patrons. She has been recognised for her charity’s work supporting education institutions in Uganda.\n‘An inspiration to us all’ Rowena Feilden, lady in waiting to the Princess Royal, is made a Dame Commander of the RVO.\nKaren Findlay, the Metropolitan Police Commander on operational duty during the Coronation is made a Lieutenant of the RVO, as are David Whelton and James Williams, who acted as the music advisers for the Coronation.\nWarrant Officer Class 2 Julian Sandford, Sergeant Major of the Band of the Household Cavalry during the Coronation parade, is made a member of the Royal Victorian Order.\nOthers who are made members of the RVO include the Royal Household’s head chef Christopher Tombling, the Royal Collection’s paper conservator Kathryn Stone, its paintings conservator Adelaide Izat, and David Foy, stud groom at the royal paddocks at Hampton Court Palace.\nRishi Sunak said: “The New Year’s Honours List recognises the exceptional achievements of people across the country and those who have shown the highest commitment to selflessness and compassion.\n“To all honourees, you are the pride of this country and an inspiration to us all.”\nRelated Topics Justin Welby, King Charles III, King Charles III coronation, New Year's Honours List, Westminster Abbey, The Royal Family",

    "text": "Fine settimana con il sole, soprattutto al Centro-Sud Inizia un periodo di alta pressione ROMA, 12 OTT - Dopo la pioggia dei giorni scorsi torna il sole e promette un fine settimana di bel tempo, soprattutto al Centro-Sud. E' l'inzio di una fase di alta pressione che dovrebbe inaugurare la prossima settimana. Lo indicano le previsioni del meteorologo Mattia Gussoni, del sito iLMeteo.it. \"Nelle prossime ore avremo prevalenza di sole\", si legge nella nota, mentre a Nord \"il cielo sarà più nuvoloso su Piemonte poi su Liguria, Valle d'Aosta e Lombardia occidentale; dal pomeriggio qualche addensamento non è escluso anche su Appennini, Alpi orientali ed Alta Toscana. Altrove il sole sarà dominante e le temperature massime saranno gradevoli: al Nord tra i 18°C e i 23°C, al Centro tra i 21°C e i 25°C, al Sud tra i 23°C e i 28°C\". Cielo sereno e sole sulla maggior parte delle regioni sono previsti anche per domenica 13 ottobre, \"salvo nubi medio-basse su Piemonte meridionale e Friuli Venezia Giulia, specie al mattino. Durante tutto il weekend non sono attese precipitazioni se non qualche piovasco sabato su Valle d'Aosta, Alto Piemonte, Alta Lombardia e Liguria\". Una situazione simile si annuncia anche per la prossima settimana, prosegue il meteorologo, con tempo \"piuttosto stabile e soleggiato quasi ovunque\". E' comuque atteso pe rlunedì \"un aumento della nuvolosità sul settentrione con la possibilità di isolata pioviggine, più probabile al Nord-Ovest\". In generale si profila sull'Italia un periodo di alta pressione, \"circondato a destra e sinistra da due zone cicloniche, una sulla Spagna ed una sulla Turchia\". Nel dettaglio: sabato 12: al Nord nuvoloso; al Centro soleggiato; al Sud soleggiato. domenica 13: al Nord nubi irregolari; al Centro via via più nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo. lunedì 14: al Nord piovaschi a ovest; al Centro poco nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo.

    "text": "A 70-year-old woman with U.S. citizenship who was thought to have been taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7 was actually killed during the initial attack, according to a statement released Thursday by the kibbutz she was taken from.\nJudy Weinstein Haggai, who was an Israeli, American and Canadian national, came under fire in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her husband, Gadi Haggai, 72, a dual U.S.-Israeli national. Both were believed to have been taken hostage, but last week Israeli officials said they had confirmed Gadi Haggai's death.\nAccording to a spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz , where the couple lived, Judy Weinstein Haggai was also \"fatally wounded\" by Hamas gunmen in the Oct. 7 attack.\nBoth bodies are still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, the spokesperson said.\nThe statement said Weinstein Haggai was a mother of four and grandmother of seven who taught English to children with special needs, and described her as a poet and entrepreneur who \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nIn a statement released by the White House, President Biden said:\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week's news that Judy's beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judy and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts. I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal.

We must keep working to bring the hostages home. We cannot wait,\" he wrote .\nThe couple's daughter, Iris, told CBS News in late November that she had seen video evidence that her father was killed, and said at that time that she had had no updates about her mother.\n\"The hostages that were released didn't see her.

Nothing.\"\nIsrael has said about 250 people were taken hostage by Hamas and other militants who rampaged through communities in southern Israel, near the Gaza border, on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas and responded with a major military assault on Gaza, which remains ongoing and has killed at least 21,000 people in the territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nA temporary cease-fire in November led to the release of 105 hostages — Israelis as well as some foreigners — in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. According to Israeli authorities, about 129 people are still being held hostage in Gaza.\nIsrael & Hamas At War More Gaza family tries to protect newborn quadruplets amid destruction of war U.S. woman believed to be Hamas hostage was killed on Oct. 7, kibbutz says Israel warns about Lebanon border hostilities as war in Gaza rages on Israel pounds central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive Israel bombs central Gaza as Netanyahu maintains hard line on Hamas More In: Hamas Israel Gaza Strip Kerry Breen Kerry Breen is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

    "title": "‘He’s Gonna Change This Defense:’ Chris Hoke Calls Patrick Queen ‘A Huge Addition’",
    "text": "For the second year in a row, the Pittsburgh Steelers put resources into the inside linebacker position. Ahead of the 2023 season, the Steelers signed Elandon Roberts, Cole Holecomb, and Kwon Alexander. Unfortunately, both Holcomb and Alexander suffered season-ending injuries during the season. Alexander is gone and\nHolcomb is starting the 2024 season on the physically unable-to-perform list.\nEnter Patrick Queen and Payton Wilson. Queen signed with the Steelers as a free agent after spending the first four seasons of his career with divisional rivals the Baltimore Ravens. The Steelers then selected Wilson in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft. There are plenty of expectations about Queen’s performance in 2024.\n“He’s gonna change this defense,” former Steelers DL Chris Hoke said on\nThursday’s episode of the Joe Starkey Show on 93.7 The Fan. “I know people are saying we’re not looking for him to make big plays. He’s gonna make big plays because that’s what he does, right? He’s athletic, he’s in the right spot, he has a great feel for the game, high football IQ. So to me, that’s a huge addition to this defense this year. I’m hoping he can stay healthy because he’s the guy that’s gonna be a difference maker.”\nHoke certainly isn’t wrong about Queen being able to make plays. He’s had at least nine tackles for a loss in every season he’s been in the league. He had three interceptions over the last two years while also tallying six passes defended in each of those seasons. He even has 13.5 sacks in 67 career games as an inside linebacker.\nRoberts acquitted himself well in 2023 as a starting linebacker for the Steelers. But the team had so many injury issues that it was signing free agents and even players who had previously late in the season. So Queen made a ton of sense to sign at the start of free agency.\nIt also made a lot of sense for the Steelers to invest a third-round pick in Wilson. He won the Dick Butkus Award in 2023 as the best linebacker in the nation. Unfortunately, his injury history led to him dropping precipitously in the draft. The Steelers were more than happy to bring him in with one of their two third-round picks.\nWilson had 138 total tackles in 2023, 17.5 tackles for a loss, six sacks, three interceptions (one returned for a touchdown), six passes defended, one forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. Wilson was a force of sheer destruction for the NC State Wolfpack.\nAnd that is why Hoke thinks Wilson will be playing early in 2024 and even more as the season rolls on.\n“I think you’re gonna see a heavy dose of Payton Wilson early on,” Hoke said. “He’s a guy they really like. Again, big and physical. He’s athletic, he can move. So I think he’s a guy that you’re gonna see really rise up and take a lot of snaps. I think you’re gonna see Payton Wilson really come on this year as you get into the middle of the season and down the stretch.”\nRookies will always take their lumps early in the season, and Hoke said as much. But he believes that as Wilson continues to learn how to play in the NFL, he’ll become more and more of an impact player.\nAnd if both Queen and Wilson are making plays for the Steelers throughout the 2024 season, that’s a good thing for both now and the future.",
