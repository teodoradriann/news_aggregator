    "text": "A police officer was taken to a hospital after their cruiser collided with another vehicle while driving to the scene of a disturbance in Connecticut. The incident happened in Hartford County on Thursday, Dec. 28 just before 7:15 a.m., when Manchester Police officers were dispatched to an active disturbance call. According to the department, a marked patrol vehicle that was driving to the scene of this disturbance with lights and sirens activated had been traveling south on Main Street (Route 83) in the area of Pearl Street when another car abruptly turned left in front of it. The two vehicles then collided in the roadway. After the initial impact, the cruiser then hit an unoccupied parked car and came to rest on the Salvation Army property on Main Street, police said. The officer suffered minor injuries and was evaluated at a nearby hospital. The other driver was not injured, according to authorities. The crash is now under investigation. Anyone who saw the incident is asked to call Sergeant Augusto at 860-645-5500. Check back to Daily Voice for updates.",

    "title": "Older Women & HPV: Rising Cervical Cancer Risk",
    "text": "Cervical Cancer Risk Rises with Age, Study Finds – HPV Remains a Threat for Women 65+ New research indicates that women over the age of 65 face a surprisingly elevated risk of developing cervical cancer due to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections, a risk that may be higher than that faced by younger women. The findings challenge conventional wisdom and underscore the need for continued screening and awareness, even in post-menopausal years.\nFor decades, cervical cancer screening programs have primarily focused on women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. However, this large-scale study reveals a concerning trend: HPV infections, and the subsequent risk of cervical cancer, do not simply disappear with age. In fact, the risk may increase as the immune system naturally weakens with advancing years.\nUnderstanding the Link Between HPV and Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is most often caused by persistent infection with high-risk types of HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection. While many HPV infections clear up on their own, some can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix, which, if left untreated, can develop into cancer. Traditionally, the focus has been on vaccination for younger individuals to prevent initial infection. However, vaccination doesn’t eliminate existing infections, and the long-term effects of HPV in older women are now coming into sharper focus.\nThe immune system plays a crucial role in controlling HPV infections. As women age, their immune systems become less efficient, potentially allowing latent HPV infections to reactivate or persist, increasing the likelihood of cancerous development. This is particularly concerning as older women may have been exposed to HPV decades earlier, before widespread vaccination programs were in place.\nWhy Older Women May Be Underscreened Several factors contribute to lower screening rates among women over 65. Some women mistakenly believe they are no longer at risk after menopause, while others may experience discomfort or anxiety associated with screening procedures. Additionally, healthcare providers may be less likely to recommend screening for older women, assuming the risk is minimal. This study strongly suggests that these assumptions are inaccurate.\nWhat role does long-term HPV infection play in the increased risk? The answer lies in the cumulative effect of viral persistence and the gradual decline in immune function. Even if an HPV infection was initially dormant, it can become active again, potentially leading to cellular changes over time.\nCould changes in sexual activity or new partners later in life contribute to increased HPV exposure? While less common, new HPV exposures are possible at any age, and can contribute to the overall risk profile. It’s important to remember that HPV is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, not just sexual intercourse.\nThe implications of these findings are significant. Healthcare providers need to re-evaluate screening guidelines and actively encourage women over 65 to undergo regular cervical cancer screening. Continued research is also needed to better understand the long-term effects of HPV in older women and to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.\nLearn more about HPV and cervical cancer prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society .\nFrequently Asked Questions About Cervical Cancer and HPV in Older Women What is the recommended age to stop cervical cancer screening? Current guidelines vary, but this research suggests that women should continue to be screened as long as they are in good health and have a life expectancy of 10 years or more. Discuss your individual risk factors with your healthcare provider. Is the HPV vaccine effective for women over 65? The HPV vaccine is most effective when administered before exposure to the virus. However, some healthcare providers may recommend it for women over 65 who have not previously been vaccinated and are sexually active, to protect against new HPV strains. What are the symptoms of cervical cancer in older women? Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and changes in vaginal discharge. However, many women with early-stage cervical cancer experience no symptoms, highlighting the importance of regular screening. How often should women over 65 be screened for cervical cancer? Screening frequency should be determined in consultation with a healthcare provider, taking into account individual risk factors and health status. Options include Pap tests, HPV tests, or a combination of both. Can HPV cause other cancers in older women? Yes, HPV is linked to several other cancers, including vaginal, vulvar, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers. Older women should be aware of these risks and discuss them with their doctor. This research underscores a critical need for a paradigm shift in how we approach cervical cancer prevention. It’s no longer sufficient to assume that older women are protected simply by virtue of their age. Proactive screening and ongoing awareness are essential to safeguarding the health of this vulnerable population.\nWhat steps will you take to discuss your cervical cancer screening options with your healthcare provider? And how can we better educate women about the ongoing risks of HPV infection throughout their lives?\nShare this important information with your friends and family to help raise awareness about cervical cancer risk in older women.\nDisclaimer: This article provides general information and should not be considered medical advice.
