    "title": "Can Taco Bell cause cancer?",
    "text": "Can Taco Bell Cause Cancer?\nTaco Bell is one of the most popular fast-food chains globally, serving millions of customers every day. But recently, concerns have been raised about the possibility of Taco Bell’s menu items increasing the risk of cancer. In this article, we’ll delve into the facts and address the question: Can Taco Bell cause cancer?\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nWhat’s at stake? The Controversial Ingredient: Carmine Carmine and Cancer Risk Others Ingredients of Concern A Lack of Transparency Other Sources of Cancer Risk Conclusion and Call to Action What’s at stake?\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for over 9 million deaths per year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified processed meat consumption, including meat from livestock treated with certain chemicals, as a definite human carcinogen. This is concerning, as Taco Bell’s menu consists mainly of processed meats and seasonings.\nThe Controversial Ingredient: Carmine\nOne of the most worrying ingredients in Taco Bell’s menu is Carmine, a food dye used in several of their products, including the Fire Sauce and the Beefy Fritos Crunchwrap. Carmine is derived from cochineal insects , which are harvested in Latin America and crushed to produce a bright red or purple pigment. While some organizations, like the FDA, deem Carmine safe for human consumption, others argue that it may pose potential health risks.\nCarmine and Cancer Risk\nStudies have linked cochineal extract (used to produce Carmine) to a higher risk of cancer in rats and mice. In 2006, a study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health found that the highest dose of cochineal extract used in the study caused chromosome damage in human lymphoblastoid cells. Additionally, an Italian study published in the International Journal of Cancer in 2002 found that cochineal extract increased the incidence of breast cancer tumors in rats.\nOthers Ingredients of Concern\nWhile Carmine has sparked controversy, other Taco Bell menu items contain ingredients that have raised red flags regarding cancer risk. For instance:\nTBHQ (Tert-Butylhydroquinone) : A food preservative used in Taco Bell’s French Toast Crunch Cereal. A 2013 study published in the journal FASEB Journal found that TBHQ induced lung adenocarcinomas in mice . TBHQ is also potential carcinogen , classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\nHigh-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) : A sweetener used in Taco Bell’s sauces and dressings. Some research suggests that HFCS consumption increases the risk of cancer , possibly by promoting the growth of cancer cells and supporting tumor development.\nA Lack of Transparency\nMany consumers are concerned about the potential cancer risks associated with Taco Bell’s ingredients due to the company’s lack of transparency about its menu items and formulations. Taco Bell has been unwilling to disclose the exact amount of Carmine used in its products or provide detailed information on its cooking processes.\nOther Sources of Cancer Risk\nTaco Bell’s menu items also pose a significant risk of cancer due to other factors:\nCooking methods : Cooking processed meats at high temperatures creates carcinogenic compounds like heterocyclic amines (HAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Taco Bell’s menu items, such as their burritos and tacos, may contain these compounds due to their cooking methods.\nSalt : High sodium intake has been linked to increased cancer risk. Taco Bell’s menu items are often high in salt, particularly due to the use of processed meats.\nConclusion and Call to Action\nIn conclusion, while there is no conclusive evidence to definitively link Taco Bell’s menu items to an increased risk of cancer, certain ingredients and cooking methods do raise concerns. We recommend that consumers:\nBe aware of the ingredients used in their meals and choose options with Fewer processed meats and added sugars\nCook their own meals using fresh and organic ingredients\nDemand greater transparency from food manufacturers like Taco Bell regarding their formulations and cooking processes\nRemember, prevention is the best medicine . Make informed choices about your diet and lifestyle to minimize the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.",

    "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 today that when the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the defendant is entitled to a jury trial under the Constitution. The case, [SEC v. Jarkesy](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859new_kifl.pdf), concerned a petition brought by a hedge fund founder challenging the constitutionality of the commission’s in-house tribunals in adjudicating SEC penalties—a policy established by the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the challenge argued that the tribunals violate the Seventh Amendment, which guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil affairs. A majority of justices upheld a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal ruling finding the SEC’s adjudication process unconstitutional. “A defendant facing a fraud suit has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers before a neutral adjudicator,” said Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority. “Rather than recognize that right, the dissent would permit Congress to concentrate the roles of prosecutor, judge and jury in the hands of the executive branch.” The American Bankers Association joined two other associations in [an amicus brief](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/sec-v-jarkesy) last year urging the Supreme Court to rule that the SEC’s administrative enforcement proceedings were unconstitutional. Among other things, the associations said such a decision would promote fair enforcement of federal banking laws against banks and their directors, officers and employees. “The specter of unfair enforcement proceedings at the banking agencies is a disincentive for talented professionals to serve as bank directors or otherwise work in the banking industry,” they said. “Affirming the Fifth Circuit’s decision will guarantee that Americans who make their living in regulated industries can rest assured that they will receive a fair shake if called to account by their regulators.”",

    "title": "No Country Is Safe: Life as a Somali Christian - International Christian Concern",
    "text": "by Matthew Often cited as the world’s best example of a “failed state,” Somalia has for several decades suffered from lawlessness and deprivation. Much of the country is extremely dangerous for anyone, and so it’s no surprise that members of its tiny Christian minority lead lives of constant fear. There are also thousands of Somali Christians outside Somalia. Despite having escaped their troubled homeland, they still often face isolation and danger, largely due to members of the Somali expat community who revile them for abandoning Islam. Few countries other than North Korea are more inhospitable toward Christianity than Somalia, an East African nation of about 16 million, almost all of whom are Muslim. The U.S. Department of State reports that only [1,000 Christians](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/somalia/) live in Somalia. However, some sources — such as the [Somali Bible Society](https://somalibiblesociety.org/) — give a drastically higher number. Ali (real name withheld for safety reasons), a Somali Christian in Uganda, agrees with the U.S. Department of State estimate. He adds, though, that there are “more than 5,000 Somali Christians outside of Somalia.” Ali says the number is growing slowly “because it’s not easy to preach the gospel to Somalis.” Interestingly, though, at least one Christian organization has Somalia ranked far above the world average in terms of its [evangelical annual growth rate](https://joshuaproject.net/countries/SO). It’s so difficult to be a Somali Christian that many might wonder why they would choose to convert. Naomi (a pseudonym), a Somali Christian who helps produce [Somali Christian TV](https://www.facebook.com/SomaliChristianTV/), says that a significant portion of Somali Christian converts became so after growing disillusioned by the widespread killing of Muslims by other Muslims in Somalia. Ali says that evangelizing through social media has also led a considerable number of Somalis to convert to Christianity. It’s quite a decision to make: If discovered, everyone you know will likely disown you — or worse. Ali says that, throughout most of Somalia, any Somali Christian who publicly “announces themselves will be killed.” Just having [a piece](https://www.persecution.org/2014/04/25/somali-christian-woman-dragged-from-home-executed-publicly/) of ostensibly Christian literature could be enough to warrant lethal violence. Though some of the attacks on Somali Christians are the work of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, such violence is by no means relegated to the terrorist fringe. Rather, it reflects the mainstream Somali viewpoint, which predominates among those in power as well as among the impoverished masses comprising much of the bereft countryside. “Outwardly, all Somali Muslims must support attacks on Somali Christians because otherwise they may not be seen as Muslim,” says Naomi. “Some, inwardly, may disagree but, due to the nature of the Somali community, they must appear to the others as though they condemn Somali Christians.” If a Somali Muslim shows any sign of sympathy to the Somali Christians, then “somebody would suspect that they are an infidel … and they themselves could be in danger of being persecuted or killed,” says Naomi. Even Somalis who were [raised Christian](https://www.persecution.org/2010/09/08/somali-christian-killed-four-children-kidnapped/) risk being killed for their faith. Ali relates that he still communicates with Somali Christians in the ravaged capital city of Mogadishu. The Somali capital has a [tiny community](http://www.fides.org/en/news/63823-AFRICA_SOMALIA_A_small_community_of_Somali_Christians_lives_their_faith_in_hiding) of elderly Catholics who grew up in an era when there was heavy Italian influence in Somalia, which became an independent country in 1960. Some of these longtime Christians have died of old age, while others have been murdered. Though the danger for Somali Christians is less extreme outside Somalia, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe. Somali pastors have been [attacked](https://www.persecution.org/2010/08/23/muslim-men-attack-somali-church-leader-in-ethiopia/) in Ethiopia and [murdered](https://www.charismanews.com/world/38167-islamic-militants-suspects-in-murder-of-2-somali-pastors) in Kenya, where many Somali Christians must live with the ongoing prospect of an attack from Somali Muslims. Even if they succeed in avoiding violence for years, they might go out for water one evening, and then the [attack](https://www.persecution.org/2020/07/16/somali-muslims-attacked-three-christian-siblings-isiolo-kenya/) finally comes. Or they might fall victim to a [home invasion](https://evangelicalfocus.com/world/4212/somali-christian-mother-beaten-and-raped-in-kenya), among other violations. Somalis who are seen outside churches in foreign countries have faced severe consequences. (This type of persecution is not an issue within Somalia, which no longer has any intact church buildings.) Naomi relates that, even in Europe, Somali Christians have faced physical assault after Somali Muslims spotted them walking out of a church. “Somalis have a culture of policing one another’s religion and it is the community’s responsibility to enact the punishment if somebody leaves Islam or they even suspect this,” says Naomi. Such punishment includes “harassment, persecution, excommunication and sometimes physical violence,” she relates. “Many have had their whole family desert them and this also leads to Somali believers being very isolated,” says Naomi, adding, “For their own safety, [Somali Christians] must move away from the Somali expat communities.” Be it inside or outside Somalia, “Known Somali Christians are not allowed to socialize with Somali Muslims,” says Aweis A. Ali, who adds that, “Many Somali Christians develop mental health issues because of the persecution and isolation.” Aweis, who has a Ph.D. from Africa Nazarene University in Nairobi, converted to Christianity in 1986, while living in Mogadishu. He is now a pastor and author of [books](https://aliaweis.academia.edu/) on Somalia and Christianity. “Many Somali Christians have been killed, kidnapped, assaulted, or put through forced reconversion” in such countries as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti, says Aweis. In Europe and North America, the acts perpetrated against Somali Christians are typically less severe but can still involve “threats, discrimination, beatings and occasional poisoning,” he says. Aweis, who often visits the U.S., says that “most Somali Muslims in the U.S. can tolerate [his] Christian faith,” but that this first acceptance changes to “intense hostility” when they find out that he has preached to Somali Muslims. “To them, this is an unforgivable sin that deserves the death penalty under Sharia law,” he says. Despite facing threats against his life and ongoing abuse on social media, Aweis remains undeterred. He says Somalis will continue to become Christian because of “dreams and visions” and the “loving and caring believers who witness to them.” There are many Somalis, though, who have little use for such ‘dreams and visions.’ Aweis believes that over 90% of Somali Muslims approve of attacks on Somali Christians. He knows all about anti-Christian violence, having served as the co-pastor of a house church in Mogadishu that, due to a series of attacks between 1994 and 1996, saw 12 of its 14 members murdered. Even if they worship exclusively within their own homes, Somali Christians must face the grim truth that most of their people despise them. And Ali, the Somali Christian in Uganda, says that, whether they are inside the homeland or half a world away, “It’s always dangerous for Somali Christians to stay around Somali Muslims.”",

    "text": "In arrivo l’ottobrata, addio al maltempo: quanto durerà il caldo, temperature miti e sole\nAntonio Palma\nL’Italia si sta preparando a dire addio al maltempo diffuso che ha caratterizzato le ultime settimane e si prepara a vivere un periodo si stabilità meteo con temperature decisamente miti e sole ovunque. È la cosiddetta ottobrata, condizioni atmosferiche particolarmente favorevoli che spesso si verificano nel mese di ottobre. Fin dall’inizio della prossima settimana, infatti, la Penisola vedrà un rinforzo dell’alta pressione che man mano rimonterà dal sud, interessando tutto il Paese con temperature in rialzo al di sopra della norma e con punte che sfioreranno anche i 30 gradi. Una situazione destinata a perdurare fino a fine mese, secondo le ultime tendenze meteo, anche se non mancheranno perturbazioni passeggere.\nMeteo, le previsioni dei prossimi giorni sull'Italia\nLe previsioni della prossima settimana indicano una graduale ripresa dell’alta pressione su tutta l’Italia, a partire dal sud, con temperature in rialzo prima sulle regioni meridionali e centrali e poi anche al nord. Nel weekend e nei primissimi giorni della settimana avremo ancora piogge su Nord ovest, Lombardia occidentale, Toscana ed entroterra della Sardegna a causa di masse d’aria più umide ed instabili ma dal sud ben presto risalirà l’alta pressione con temperature in aumento e tempo asciutto. Da martedì, infatti, avremo condizioni prevalentemente stabili su tutta l’Italia con temperature sopra la media ovunque.\nTemperature estive: picchi fino a 28°\nL’ottobrata porterà condizioni meteo stabili in gran parte delle regioni, in particolare al centro sud, dove si raggiungeranno diffusamente picchi di 28 gradi e in alcuni casi si sfioreranno i trenta gradi. Da mercoledì infatti un ulteriore rinforzo dell’alta pressione sull’Italia porterà tempo stabile e clima mite fino al nord. Temperature estive attese in particolare sulla Sardegna con valori prossimi ai 30 gradi ma valori alti previsti anche nelle città del centro come Roma e Firenze.\nQuanto durerà il caldo in Italia\nIl modello climatologico prevalente indica al momento che la situazione meteo di stabilità e caldo estivo è destinata a perdurare fino a fine mese. Non mancheranno però brevi incursioni temporalesche al nord, in particolare a ridosso dei due weekend restanti, quando l'alta pressione sarà ancora insidiata da un flusso atlantico con meteo più incerto.\n<a href=\"https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/crollo-delle-temperature-e-piogge-in-arrivo-quando-e-dove-fara-freddo-le-previsioni-meteo-di-giulio-betti/\">\n</a>",

    "text": "Warum Forscher empfehlen, 30 Pflanzen pro Woche zu essen\nNeue Studienergebnisse legen nahe, dass es wichtig sein kann, mindestens 30 Pflanzen pro Woche zu verzehren. Was das bedeutet und was dahintersteckt.\nDen Leitspruch „5 am Tag“ für eine gesunde Ernährung wird jeder kennen. Jetzt geht eine Empfehlung US-amerikanischen Forscher einen Schritt weiter. Statt sich auf die Menge an Obst und Gemüse zu konzentrieren, sollten wir auf die Vielfalt achten. Dabei schlagen die Forscher vor, mindestens 30 unterschiedliche pflanzliche Lebensmittel pro Woche zu konsumieren.\nWarum sollte man 30 Pflanzen die Woche essen?\nDie Empfehlung, 30 verschiedene Pflanzen pro Woche zu essen, stammt aus dem American Gut Project, das weltweit Stuhlproben von über 10.000 Menschen analysierte. Die Studie zeigt, dass eine größere Vielfalt an pflanzlichen Lebensmitteln das Darmmikrobiom positiv beeinflusst. Ein vielfältiges Mikrobiom ist ein Indikator für gute Gesundheit, da es zahlreiche Körperfunktionen unterstützt, von der Verdauung bis zur Immunabwehr.\nDie Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, dass Personen, die mehr als 30 verschiedene pflanzliche Lebensmittel pro Woche konsumierten, eine größere mikrobielle Vielfalt im Darm aufwiesen als jene, die weniger als zehn verschiedene Pflanzen aßen. Diese Vielfalt ist entscheidend, da sie die Bildung von Hormonen und Vitaminen sowie die Stärkung der Darmbarriere fördert. Unter diesen Pflanzen fallen auch einige Lebensmittel, die für ein langes Leben sorgen.\nWarum Vielfalt wichtig ist\nEine vielfältige Ernährung ist nicht nur wegen der unterschiedlichen Geschmacksrichtungen von Vorteil, sondern vor allem wegen der Vielzahl an Nährstoffen, die sie liefert. Unterschiedliche Pflanzenarten enthalten verschiedene Vitamine, Mineralien und sekundäre Pflanzenstoffe, die allesamt der Gesundheit förderlich sind, wie HEIDELBERG24 berichtet.\nIm Gegensatz zur Menge ist die Vielfalt entscheidend, da sie dem Körper eine breitere Palette an Nährstoffen bietet. Diese Vielfalt kann helfen, Mangelerscheinungen zu vermeiden und das Risiko chronischer Krankheiten zu reduzieren. Eine abwechslungsreiche pflanzliche Ernährung unterstützt zudem das Wachstum nützlicher Bakterien im Darm, die eine wichtige Rolle in der Immunabwehr spielen. Nicht nur pflanzliche Lebensmittel – auch der gesündeste Joghurt ist besonders gut für Darmflora.\nWie schafft man es 30 Pflanzen pro Woche zu essen?\nUm die 30 verschiedenen Pflanzenarten pro Woche zu erreichen, ist die Methode der Plant Points nützlich. Jede pflanzliche Zutat zählt als ein Punkt, frische Kräuter einen halben Punkt und Gewürze einen Viertelpunkt. Diese spielerische Herangehensweise kann helfen, die Vielfalt der Ernährung zu erhöhen. Es zählen nicht nur Obst und Gemüse, sondern auch Nüsse, Samen, Hülsenfrüchte und Getreide.\nPraktische Tipps beinhalten das Motto „Eat the Rainbow“– je bunter, desto besser – und die Verwendung von saisonalen und regionalen Produkten, um Abwechslung zu gewährleisten. Auch das Anlegen von Vorräten an verschiedenen Getreidesorten, Nüssen und Samen kann helfen, die Vielfalt im Alltag zu erhöhen.\nWelche Vorteile bieten eine Ernährung mit 30 Planzen die Woche?\nUm die 30 Pflanzen pro Woche zu erreichen, empfiehlt es sich, die Vielfalt der Jahreszeiten zu nutzen und regional verfügbare Produkte zu bevorzugen. Fermentierte Lebensmittel wie Kimchi oder Sauerkraut ergänzen die pflanzliche Vielfalt, darüber hinaus unterstützen fermentierte Lebensmittel im Besonderen die Darmflora.\nEine vielfältige pflanzliche Ernährung bietet zahlreiche gesundheitliche Vorteile. Sie kann die Darmgesundheit verbessern, das Immunsystem stärken und zur allgemeinen körperlichen Fitness beitragen. Studien zeigen, dass eine größere Vielfalt an Pflanzen in der Ernährung das Risiko von Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes senken kann. (rah)",

    "title": "Sheriff Bryant Recounts Experience as Sumter County’s First African American Sheriff",
    "text": "By Joshua Windus ,\n4 hours ago Sheriff Eric Bryant, first African American Sheriff of Sumter County, traces his law enforcement career to the influence of a cousin. Seeing him work as a police officer made a strong impression, and Bryant described a desire to become like him. “If we were playing cops and robbers if I couldn’t be a cop, I didn’t want to play. I always wanted to be the law enforcement guy. And I think that’s why my passion for it now is as great as it is because it’s something I’ve always wanted to do.”\nBryant talked about how his initial plan was to become a member of the military police, joining up after he graduated high school. While he was unable to become an MP, he noted the experience he gained from basic training. “Once I came back, I started out in college, trying to work towards a criminal justice degree. I soon saw that school wasn’t for me.”\nSheriff Bryant mentioned that sitting still didn’t suit him. “And I wanted to be doing more. So again, I was a reservist in the Marine Corps at that time, and I start applying for jobs.” Byrant told how he had applied to the Americus police department when he was sixteen and was turned down because of his age. After the Marine Corps, he tried a different route. “I’m 18 years of age, and I applied at the sheriff’s office for your jailer position. And that opportunity presented itself in 1996. I was hired by Sheriff Randy Howard. And I began working in the jail.”\nBryant described the experience as a dream come true. He talked about how after working at the jail for a length of time, he was able to go to the police academy in Tifton Georgia. Unfortunately, a deputy sheriff’s pay wasn’t enough to support him. “Probably the most saddest time of my life was in 1999, in December, I turned in a letter of resignation to the sheriff at that time.”\nBryant went from sheriff’s deputy to assistant director at the school transportation system, later becoming the director.\nHowever, Bryant found an opportunity to return to law enforcement when Pete Smith ran for the office of sheriff. Smith asked if Bryant would become his chief deputy if elected. Smith won the election in 2005. “He hired me on, and I’ve been here ever since. And we’ve just been excited about the growth, the changes, even here in our community, and even in this organization.”\nWhen Smith passed away in October of 2020, Bryant became the interim sheriff. At the time, he was running for sheriff on the democratic ticket against a republican candidate. Bryant went from interim sheriff to elected sheriff in three months. He described becoming the first man of color to become Sheriff in Sumter County. “Not only was it humbling, it was exciting, but it was also emotional because it shows people it’s not about sometimes the color of your skin, but it’s how you carry yourself, how you conduct business, how you treat people, and that’s how I was raised.”\nHe recounted his family’s excitement when he became the first person in the family to hold an elected position. “My biggest cheerleader was my dad. My dad was so excited, because my dad grew up in the time where you didn’t see people of color in leadership positions. He and I used to talk about how things were when he was a child and a young teen and the things he experienced.”\nHe mentioned how becoming Sheriff was both humbling and empowering in a diverse community that show him their support. “I still pinch myself to make sure it’s real.”\nBryant gave his advice for those with similar aspirations to break new ground. “If you have a dream, if you have a goal, you stay focused and work toward that goal. I’ve worked in different areas in different capacities. But I stay focused on wanting to achieve that goal of getting into law enforcement here in the community where I was born and raised. And that’s what I was able to do.”\nThe post Sheriff Bryant Recounts Experience as Sumter County’s First African American Sheriff appeared first on Americus Times-Recorder .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Cats and Islam: Why felines are the faith's 'most highly regarded pet' [Shahid Meighan](https://www.dispatch.com/staff/71216819007/shahid-meighan/) Certain animals have long been considered companions for humankind. Whether for comfort and partnership or for more practical purposes like pest control and guarding people and livestock, humans have always had a relationship with animals of some sort. While Americans tend to place dogs at the top of the pet pyramid, cats, both in the past and now, hold a special and coveted space in other cultures. In ancient Egypt, for example, cats were viewed as integral parts of the culture and they were even thought to carry an important role in the afterlife, which explains why they were discovered in tombs alongside humans. Cats also served a practical purpose by chasing away pests like mice and scorpions. Cats are also depicted in [Middle Eastern and ancient Egyptian artwork dating back centuries,](https://www.arabamerica.com/cats-in-islam-and-the-arab-world/) and immortalized in miniature sculptures, incense holders, and other trinkets and art pieces. Some sculptures and statues even had cat-like heads, with deities sharing this same description. In Islam, these feline friends are afforded special privileges compared to other pets, like dogs and cattle, says Imran Malik, a practicing Muslim and interfaith coordinator of the [Noor Islamic Cultural Center](https://www.noorohio.org/)'s main campus. \"Cats have a very special place in the Muslim household and in the Muslim culture in general,\" Malik told the Dispatch. According to Malik, this reverence and adoration for cats stems from them being viewed as clean, pure, and hygienic. In fact, in mosques throughout the world, [cats can be seen roaming the halls](https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/catstanbul-not-constantinople-welcome-feline-capital-world), are considered an integral part of the Islamic community and are granted leeway and access in these spiritual dwellings compared to other pets. Cats are even allowed to rest on Muslims' [prayer rugs- which are required to be clean and hygienic at all times.](https://www.learnreligions.com/how-prayer-rugs-are-used-2004512) Prophet Muhammad and \"The Father of Kittens\" The adoration of cats in Islam can be traced to the faith's Hadith (literally meaning 'statement'), a collection of wisdom and phrases from Prophet Muhammad. The story goes that the Prophet himself was fond of cats and owned several. [There is even a well-known tale](https://www.arabamerica.com/cats-in-islam-and-the-arab-world/) about how the Prophet woke up one morning for the call to prayers when he noticed that his own cat, Muezza, fell asleep on the sleeve of his robe. Most people would have woken their cat if it fell asleep on any of their clothes. Instead, as the story goes, Prophet Muhammad chose to cut off a piece of the sleeve of his robe and attend the prayer session, so he didn't disturb Muezza's sleep. In a separate hadith, [it is said that Prophet Muhammad had a traveling companion named Abu Hurayrah,](https://www.the-wayfarer.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222%3Athe-sunnah-and-blessings-in-healing-effects-of-cats&catid=8%3Aarticles&Itemid=8&limitstart=2) a nickname that translates to \"father of cats.\" Prophet Muhammad gave him this nickname because Abu Hurayrah always carried a small cat with him in a bag. As the story goes, this same cat also saved Muhammad's life from a snake. While the authenticity of these tales is debated by Islamic scholars, they serve to highlight the fondness, respect and reverence that Islam shows towards cats, and the greater message that all Muslims are required treat all living things with empathy, compassion, and kindness. \"It is heavily subscribed that [you should] take care of your animals and that you should not be mean to them, you should not be aggressive to them, and you should be very humane and polite in in your relationship to your animals as well,\" says Malik. So, are Muslims not allowed to own dogs? While owning dogs is not strictly forbidden in the faith, it is generally frowned upon, says Malik. However, if dogs are being used in service such as guide dogs, to herd livestock, or for protection, it is permissible, as long as efforts are made to maintain the hygiene of the home. \"Cats are considered to be a lot more hygienic compared to dogs,\" says Malik. While it is usually recommended that dogs be kept outside of the home, Malik also acknowledges that this may not be practical or humane, depending on the environment or weather conditions. \"You know, you don't want to put your pet outside in an environment which can be either too cold or too hot for them to bear,\" says Malik. \"If you can manage them [dogs], then I think you're okay, because at the end of the day it's just a life that you're caring for.\"@ShahidMeighan smeighan@dispatch.com",
