    "text": "Se espera un viernes caluroso en Misiones, con advertencia por tiempo seco y peligro de incendio extremo\nEste viernes, 3 de enero, y también el sábado 4, la provincia de Misiones tendrá jornadas calurosas y soleadas, según el informe de la Dirección de Meteorología y de Prevención de Riesgos Naturales (OPAD) de Posadas y el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN). Las temperaturas oscilarán entre los 24°C de mínima y los 34°C de máxima en ambos días.\nA pesar de las condiciones favorables para actividades al aire libre, las autoridades emitieron una advertencia celeste que se condice por el tiempo seco. Esta alerta está acompañada por un peligro extremo de incendios, sobre todo en el sur provincial, ya que la falta de humedad en el ambiente aumenta significativamente el riesgo de que se produzcan siniestros de este tipo.\nEn sintonía con eso, se recomienda a la población tomar precauciones, como evitar la quema de residuos o en áreas rurales, no arrojar colillas de cigarrillos y reportar cualquier foco de incendio a las autoridades correspondientes. Asimismo, es fundamental mantenerse hidratado y limitar la exposición al sol en las horas de mayor intensidad.\nEl pronóstico indica que estas condiciones se extenderán durante el fin de semana, por lo que se insta a la ciudadanía a estar atentos a las actualizaciones y advertencias emitidas por los organismos oficiales.\nEl tiempo en 2025\nEl SMN publicó su pronóstico climático para el período de enero a marzo del año que recién arranca. En el documento, se pronostica un trimestre caracterizado por temperaturas elevadas y lluvias irregulares en diversas zonas del país.\nEl referido informe indica que las lluvias se mantendrán dentro de los niveles habituales en gran parte de la región central, Cuyo y el sur de la Patagonia, con precipitaciones que van de 200 a 400 milímetros, dependiendo de la zona. En cambio, el centro-este de Buenos Aires, el norte del Litoral y el norte de la Patagonia podrían registrar precipitaciones que se encuentren dentro del rango normal o por debajo de él, mientras que el Noroeste Argentino tendría probabilidades de lluvias dentro de lo esperado o superiores a lo normal.\nEsto deviene luego de un fin de año atípico para la región, con temperaturas mucho más bajas de lo esperado. Sin embargo, otro de los puntos clave que remarcan desde el SMN es la demora de La Niña en llegar, con menos sequías de lo que se estimaba.\nAsimismo, respecto a la temperatura promedio, se anticipa que en el sur del Litoral se mantendrán dentro de los valores normales, mientras que en Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Córdoba, Santa Fe, Cuyo y el norte del país las temperaturas serán normales o superiores a lo habitual. En la región noroeste y la Patagonia, las temperaturas medias podrían superar los registros históricos.",

    "text": "New India Co-op Bank fraud: EOW registers fresh FIR over loan default\nThe New India Cooperative Bank fraud surfaced in February this year during a surprise audit by rbi officials\nMUMBAI: Three senior executives of the Percept Group, organiser of the Sunburn music festival, have been booked in connection with the New India Cooperative Bank fraud case for alleged loan irregularities and providing kickbacks to senior bank officials.\nAll three individuals have been named in a First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police investigating irregularities in loans sanctioned by the bank.\nPolice said the Percept Group, a prominent entertainment, media and communications conglomerate, had taken a ₹77-crore loan from New India Cooperative Bank, of which ₹18.56 crore was waived by senior bank officials also named in the FIR. Directors of the scheduled bank accepted ₹6.37 crore in kickbacks for declaring the loan as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) and waiving ₹18.56 crore on the principal sum as well as on interest due.\nAccording to the EOW, the loan had been sanctioned to Percept without due diligence and the offence had been committed between September 2014 and October 2023.\nPolice said that while investigating bad loans extended by the bank, they found documents in Bhoan’s home – he was arrested several months ago – and the trail eventually led to the Percept Group.\nThe New India Cooperative Bank fraud surfaced in February, when a surprise audit by the Reserve Bank of India revealed that ₹122 crore had been spirited away from the bank’s cash reserves. The EOW has since registered several FIRs, including the one implicating the Percept Group, while uncovering a complex web of financial irregularities committed by the bank.\nThis FIR, registered at the Dadar police station on Wednesday, names Harindra Pal Singh, founder and managing director of the Percept Group; two senior executives of Percept, Manoj Kumar Patra and Suket Kumar Patel; unnamed directors of the group; Hiren Bhanu and his wife Gauri, former vice-chairperson of the bank; Ranjit Bhanu, Hiren’s father, the now deceased founder of the bank and former MLA from Colaba; Abhimanyu Bhoan, former CEO of the bank; and two senior bank executives, retired IAS officer Satish Chander and Damyanati Salunkhe.\nExplaining how the kickbacks were paid to the New India Cooperative Bank officials, police said Hiren Bhanu, Bhoan, and Patel fabricated bills in the name of a UK-based shell company floated by Bhanu, and charged those sums, collectively amounting to ₹6.37 crore, to Percept.\n“We have registered offences under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servants, bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys or agents), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to a person whose interest offender is bound to protect) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said the police officer.\nExplore now!\nStay updated with all the\nBreaking Newsand\nLatest Newsfrom\nMumbai.

    "text": "Complaint against Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor for hurting religious sentiments A complaint has been filed against Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor in the Ghatkopar Police Station for allegedly hurting religious sentiments over a viral video while celebrating Christmas. A complaint has been filed against Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor in the Ghatkopar Police Station for allegedly hurting religious sentiments over a viral video while celebrating Christmas. The complaint has been filed by Bombay High Court’s advocates Ashish Rai and Pankaj Mishra in which they have demanded to register a case under sections 295A, 298,500 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, the police have not yet registered any FIR in the matter. In the viral video, wine and liquor are poured over a cake and then [Ranbir Kapoor](https://www.sentinelassam.com/entertainment/bollywood/ranbir-alias-daughter-finally-makes-her-first-appearance-on-christmas-683015) sets it on fire saying, ‘Jai Mata Di’. The rest of the family members also chanted the same. According to the complaint, the fire god is invoked in Hinduism before invoking other deities, but Ranbir Kapoor and his family members deliberately used intoxicants while celebrating Christmas and chanted “Jai Mata Di”. The video has been made and circulated to insult the religious sentiments of the complainants, it alleged.

In an exclusive statement, Andrew Wyatt told RadarOnline.com that the public must look at the \"lack of facts\" and \"ease their personal feelings\" against the actor, 86, and the Hollywood movie producer, 72.\n MEGA The New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction on sex crimes against three women in a shocking 4-3 opinion on Thursday.\nAs this outlet reported, the New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction on sex crimes against three women in a shocking 4-3 opinion on Thursday, determining the trial judge \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes.\"\nThe court also determined that the accusers' testimonies \"served no material non-propensity purpose\" and \"portrayed\" Weinstein \"in a highly prejudicial light.\"\n Cosby was released in June 2021 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his sexual assault conviction.\n Cosby was convicted of sexual assault in 2018 and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. He was released in June 2021 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and while the comedian got to walk out of prison a free man, the same can't be said for Weinstein.\nIn 2022, he was also convicted of rape in Los Angeles and sentenced to 16 years.
