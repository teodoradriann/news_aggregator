    "text": "Alamance Rescue Squad answered the call during Tropical Storm Chantal\nEditorial Standards\nEditorial Standards\nSixty-one calls for service — that’s how many water rescues emergency crews responded to in Alamance County Sunday night. One of those agencies is the Alamance County Rescue Squad.\nThe Alamance County Rescue Squad is a volunteer service. They have normal, everyday jobs — but those volunteers courageously answered call after call when Chantal moved through the county Sunday night.\nOn Tuesday, volunteers at the Alamance Rescue Squad were cleaning their gear and preparing for the next emergency.\nIt's not an easy task after the Haw River flooded communities throughout the county Sunday night.\nNathan Prince said, “It's pretty crazy to see. The water in the Haw River came up so quick. It, I mean, it seemed like it was rising by the second.”\nNathan Prince is a six-year veteran of the Rescue Squad. He said calls started coming in around 5 p.m. Sunday night and never seemed to stop.\nPrince said, “Just the heavy rain came in. Calls slowly started coming in. Started out with, you know, some vehicles in water with some people in it. We started getting calls where cars were getting washed off of roads, off of bridges. then we started getting calls about houses being flooded in neighborhoods needing to be evacuated.”\nPrince shared the story of one memorable rescue.\n“There was two cars involved. One was still on the road, and the driver of that vehicle said they thought they saw a second vehicle. We ended up going up, looking over the bridge, and we saw a victim hanging on onto a tree. Just. Just by mere luck that we actually saw him there,\" Prince said.\nPrince said there were times when the water was moving so fast that even rescuers couldn’t go in.\n“It's scary. And, you know, it's heartbreaking at the same time because, you know, there's people in need and at that time, you just kind of have to sit and wait,” Prince said.\nEventually, exhaustion set in, but they had to fight through. And with the threat of severe weather every night this week, there’s certainly no rest for the weary.\nPrince said, “We're here. We're ready. You know, if that call comes out, we're ready to go.”",

    "text": "First heat-related deaths this year reported in Idaho [CHRISTINA LORDS / Idaho Capital Sun]() | June 21, 2024 2:30 PM The first two heat-related deaths in Idaho this year have been reported to the Division of Public Health. Both Idaho residents were over the age of 60, according to a press release Friday. “Please stay safe if you head outdoors this summer,” said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho public health medical director. “Stay hydrated, wear sunscreen and a hat with a brim, and be aware that even if it’s cool in the morning, temperatures can rise a lot during the day this time of year.” Temperatures this weekend are forecast to get close to 100 degrees in the southern areas of Idaho and in the 80s in North Idaho. Late June and early July usually ushers in the hot weather season in Idaho, and Idahoans should take precautions to ensure they stay safe, the release said. Anyone can get heat-related illness, but those at greater risk are young children, older adults and people who are overweight or have underlying health conditions or take certain medications that reduce the body’s ability to stay cool, the release said. Be aware of symptoms of heat-related illness and how to treat them The most serious type of heat-related illness is heatstroke, a medical emergency. Symptoms may include high body temperature, hot red skin, confusion or seizures, nausea, dizziness and fainting. If someone experiences these symptoms and cannot quickly get medical care, call 911 right away. Move to a cooler place and use cool wet cloths or ice on the head, neck, armpits and groin, or soak clothing with cool water or give a cool bath to help lower body temperature. Speed cooling with a fan. Do not give a person with heatstroke anything to drink, as they may not be able to swallow correctly and could inhale the fluid instead of swallowing it, the release said. Health officials recommend trying to stay cool on hot days by wearing lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; limit outdoor activity to the coolest hours of morning and evening; drink plenty of fluids; avoid alcohol and drinks with high caffeine or sugar and wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses and wear sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher.",

A live tracker by Bluesky employee Jaz indicated the platform surpassed 16 million users, coinciding with the reported outages.Several factors contribute to Bluesky's growing user base, including dissatisfaction with changes on other social media platforms. Several high-profile celebrities have recently announced their departure from competitor platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Among them is American television journalist Don Lemon, who shared his reasons in a video: “I once believed it was a place for honest debate, discussion, transparency, and free speech. But now, I feel it no longer serves that purpose.” Other notable figures like Jamie Lee Curtis, Elton John, Mia Farrow, Whoopi Goldberg, and Lizzo have also transitioned to Bluesky.",

    "text": "[Israel](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/israel) rechazó el jueves los llamados mundiales a un alto el fuego con el movimiento libanés [Hezbollah](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/hezbollah), desafiando a su principal aliado, Estados Unidos, y prosiguiendo con sus ataques, que causaron centenares de muertos en [Líbano ](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/libano/5)y aumentan el temor a una guerra regional total. Un avión de combate israelí bombardeó los alrededores de la capital, Beirut, causando dos muertos y 15 heridos, entre ellos una mujer en estado crítico, según informó el Ministerio de Salud libanés. Con esta cifra, ya son 28 las víctimas mortales causadas por los impactos durante la noche y el jueves. El ataque acabó con la vida del jefe de una de las unidades de las fuerzas aéreas de Hezbollah, Mohammad Surur, según dos fuentes de seguridad, el último alto mando del grupo que ha sido blanco de un ataque en los últimos días. Tras el ataque se vio salir humo cerca de una zona en la que hay varias instalaciones de Hezbollah y en la que también viven y trabajan muchos civiles. En el lado israelí de la frontera con Líbano, el ejército realizó un ejercicio de simulación de una invasión terrestre, una posible próxima etapa tras los incesantes ataques aéreos y las explosiones de dispositivos de comunicación. Israel prometió asegurar su norte y devolver a sus comunidades a miles de ciudadanos evacuados desde que Hezbollah lanzara el año pasado una campaña de ataques transfronterizos en solidaridad con los militantes palestinos que luchan en Gaza. \"No habrá alto el fuego en el norte\", declaró el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, [Hezbollah](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/hezbollah), en la red social X. \"Seguiremos luchando contra la organización terrorista Hezbolá con todas nuestras fuerzas hasta la victoria y el regreso seguro de los residentes del norte a sus hogares\". Washington busca un alto al fuego El secretario de Estado estadounidense, Antony Blinken, declaró a la cadena MSNBC que las principales potencias mundiales quieren un alto el fuego y que se reunirá con responsables israelíes en Nueva York a última hora del jueves. El primer ministro israelí, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu), que se dirigía a Nueva York para pronunciar un discurso ante la ONU, dijo que aún no respondió a la propuesta de tregua y dio instrucciones al ejército para que siga combatiendo. Más de 600 personas murieron desde el lunes en los ataques de Israel contra Líbano. Hezbollah disparó cientos de misiles contra objetivos en Israel, incluido su centro comercial, Tel Aviv, aunque el sistema de defensa aérea israelí garantizó que los daños hayan sido limitados. El jefe del ejército israelí hizo el miércoles el comentario público más explícito hasta la fecha sobre la posibilidad de un ataque terrestre contra Líbano, al decir a las tropas cercanas a la frontera que estuvieran preparadas para cruzar. Hoy, aviones de combate israelíes atacaron infraestructuras en la frontera sirio-libanesa para detener la transferencia de armas de Siria a Hezbolá en Líbano, según informó el ejército israelí. El Ministerio de Salud libanés afirmó que la mayoría de las víctimas del jueves son sirios que perecieron en la ciudad de Younine, en el valle de la Bekaa. En Líbano viven cerca de 1,5 millones de sirios que huyeron de la guerra civil. Con información de Reuters",

    "title": "三年裁员1.5万人，微软游戏要完蛋了吗？",
    "text": "不是，微软游戏到底怎么了？\n前两天，微软宣布裁员9000人，而这已经是微软三年来第五次裁员，总人数高达1.5万。\n虽然是整个微软大裁员，但斯宾塞领导的XBOX部门，也是这次裁员的核心对象之一。\n这波不光关闭了2020年从顽皮狗，R星，圣莫妮卡等等大厂招来的大佬组成的工作室“Initiative”，\n还把《使命召唤》、《糖果传奇》、《极限竞速》这些大伙印象里的摇钱树裁了个遍。\n感觉前几年微软还哐哐买工作室，一股誓要和老任索尼干个天翻地覆的架势。\n结果现在一看裁员人数，纯属孙权跑马拉松—— 一骑绝尘了。\n小发也回想一下，感觉最近几年除了地平线还偶尔上去跑两把之外，几乎就没怎么玩过微软*方的游戏了。\n混到现在这样，有人觉得微软是太粗放，光撒钱不管事，也有人觉得是拥抱DEI摧毁了微软的创作能力。\n但小发觉得，微软走到今天，完全是咎由自取。\n虽然现在微软一直给人一种土大款，只会撒钱不运营的既视感，但XBOX曾经，确实靠着这种打法辉煌过。\n2001年，面临着索尼PS2的压力，微软掏出了初代XBOX和配套王炸游戏《光环：战斗进化》。\n这游戏在2001年就实现了半开放关卡，将丰富的载具驾驶和科幻射击*结合，还有近乎*的手柄操作优化。让全世界都看到了主机平台玩FPS游戏的潜力。\n随后推出的《光环2》也是异常牛逼，发售*天卖了238 万份，收入 1.25 亿美元，是当时美国历史上销量最快的媒体产品，现在看这成绩都觉得够离谱的。\n光这两款游戏就带动了初代XBOX巨大的成功，让微软成为了能和任天堂索尼匹敌的主机巨头。\n但实际上，XBOX的成功，某种意义上可能只是个巧合。\n因为微软高层最初对待XBOX业务，态度其实非常摇摆。\n2000年比尔·盖茨确实感受到了PS2的压力。\n但那不是因为PS2玩游戏牛逼，而是觉得这玩意内置DVD光驱，能联网，还能玩游戏，看上去就是个小型PC嘛。\n而好巧不巧此时SIE还叫作“索尼电脑娱乐公司”。\n比尔盖茨一看，说坏了，这冲我PC来的，得想办法防一手。\n所以XBOX本质，就是个防御性质的项目，比尔盖茨一开始也只分配了几十人，压根没指望能有多大成功。\n像后来领导XBOX项目的执行副总裁艾德·弗莱斯就觉得，因为团队小，他做的每个决定在公司都有反对者。\n“有些人只是根据公司目标来发号施令，而不是看怎么能让游戏做好。“\n艾德·弗莱斯算是当时微软高管里少有的实干派。\n比如他带领XBOX收购了《帝国时代》的全效工作室，要求支持《光环》开发,还把《忍者龙剑传》抢到了XBOX上。\n但在带领初代XBOX走向成功后，艾德·弗莱斯却毅然抛弃一手拉起的项目，选择离开微软，可见有多少委屈了。\n到了360时代，微软看上去是一路顺风顺水，但某种意义上，也是靠着一位大神极限微操——彼德摩尔。\n这哥们在360时期疯狂解决初代XBOX痛点，比如主机太大，他就要求集成化。\n手柄笨重难用，他也要求重新设计，提高舒适度。\n最重要的，是他延续了艾德的方针，拉拢了一大票本打算在PS3独占游戏的日本厂商，像脱裤魔的《忍者龙剑传》、万代的《皇牌空战》、卡普空的《鬼泣》SE的《最终幻想13》等等。\n所以360时代，XBOX还是走向了*，三年就卖出1000多万台，远超同期的PS3。\n但是，没错说了这么多，小发要说但是了。\n即使成绩如此辉煌，但XBOX360的这种成功，却没有改变微软对XBOX业务的管理模式。\n事实上在微软内部，几乎所有的重要业务，都是CEO本人自上而下推进的。\n微软虽然是一个拥有大量不同部门的科技巨头，但从比尔盖茨到他的继任者史蒂夫·鲍尔默，都会要求不同子业务，协同其他子业务。\n任何一个子业务的大动作，也都要CEO本人来审批。\n比如比尔盖茨在任时，他认为微软应该成为软件和网络客户服务的供应商，就要求旗下所有业务都要涉及联网服务，订阅制收费。\n最经典的就是XBOX360时代的kinect，这个体感设备是继任比尔盖茨的鲍尔默强力推进的，花了大价钱。\n但问题是，kinect占地不小，玩家还得额外花钱购买，大多数厂商也不太愿意做一款只能体感游玩的游戏。\n最后kinect成了一个花大钱，干小事的鸡肋产品，而彼德摩尔最后也只干了短短四年就从微软离职。\n后来从任天堂转投微软，开发了《盗贼之海》的rare工作室也给微软来了一段精辟的总结。\n上过班的朋友都知道，光看到上面这几个词，就已经开始头大了。\n而这一次大裁员的原因，也是微软CEO又要连打方向盘了。\n2014年，微软CEO萨蒂亚·纳德拉接替鲍尔默上台，这位印度裔总裁，作为曾经微软云计算部门的掌舵人，一上台就提拔了菲尔·斯宾塞来管游戏业务。\n这位CEO当年一手操办了微软的Azure云服务建设，所以这些年他一直支持斯宾塞利用微软已有的云基建，放弃主机独占策略，转向全平台订阅制。\n但这就让XBOX的目标又从造好主机硬件，做好游戏，改变成了，建立一个跨平台服务商店。\n于是斯宾塞带着大量资源一心投在自己想搞的XBOX的网络服务，比如XGP。\n然而，在游戏开发这块，斯宾塞则彻底松手。\n大伙可能还记得微软的*方“大作”《红霞岛》，IGN4分，MC用户评分3.6，能和《咕噜》《金刚》坐一桌。\n但硬要说开发组也挺冤的。\n根据彭博社采访，《红霞岛》最初是Arkane母公司ZeniMax为了把自己给微软卖个好价钱。\n所以强行要求Arkane做服务型游戏。\n但Arkane一直都是传统的单机开发团队，没有任何服务型游戏经验。项目开始就有人反对，但无人在意，斯宾塞在收购后也丝毫不管，最后导致开发人员流失70%，游戏都没做完。\n斯宾塞也不是没有回应过微软的管理层问题。在2018年的DICE峰会，斯宾塞公开反思微软的领导层文化，说要进行强力的内部改革。\n但他觉得改革方向应该是——多元化。\n他觉得XBOX内部的一切问题，核心在于不够“包容”。员工之间不能包容的聆听不同声音，领导与团队也不够多元。\n于是他提拔了这位——莎拉·邦德作为XBOX品牌CEO，负责XBOX游戏业务的发展规划。\n小发查了一下这位CEO的履历，简单总结，就是没有任何游戏行业履历。\nXBOX的游戏工作室也大力推行多元化标准，提高少数族裔与非男性性别在领导层中的比例，建立多元化审核团队。\n然后，这是去年九月的新闻。。。\n最近几年，纳德拉的新方向则是AI，前两天他说这次裁员1.5万人是因为要加大对AI领域的投资。\n但放游戏这块，大伙最直观感受到的则是《使命召唤21》里六根手指的僵尸。\n当然，单从财报来看，XGP的营收目前还是非常顶，去年单季度就有54亿美元的营收，总数比任天堂还高，\n这次裁员说不定还能让微软的财报更上一层楼，但，对游戏玩家和XBOX的未来来说，可能都未必是好事。\n比如小发几年前确实薅了不少XGP的羊毛。但现在XGP不断涨价，性价比逐渐失去。\n开发者也开始吐槽XGP，Arkane开发者就爆料说虽然XGP号称盈利，但为XGP制作游戏的大量工作室却几乎没什么收益。\n对于玩家来说，期待已久的游戏和工作室突然被取消肯定也是一种伤害。\n人们常说穷则思变，但XBOX现状是，还没有穷到要思变的地步，但所有走的业务，却都到了悬崖边上。\n微软想靠着轻资产，重服务的方式在游戏行业弯道超车，小发觉得这更像一边抽着地基水泥，一边尝试往上盖一个“空中楼盖”，结果不言而喻。\n也许微软还能想出新的杀招，配合ROG卖掌机，说不定也能起到意想不到的效果。\n但玩家想要的到底是无微不至的客户服务，还是有趣，有想法，有创造力的游戏？\n大家心里自有答案。\n【本文由投资界合作伙伴微信公众号：差评授权发布，本平台仅提供信息存储服务。】如有任何疑问，请联系（editor@zero2ipo.com.cn）投资界处理。",
