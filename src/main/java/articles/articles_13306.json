    "title": "Frost Fair revival at Bankside London on the river Thames | Ham & High",
    "text": "Lest you think that extreme weather events are unique to modern life, there was an extraordinary period in London’s history when the River Thames froze over 24 times between 1605 and 1814. Unable to work, sailors, bargeman and riverside dwellers created an ‘on ice’ fair with markets, traditional games, gambling, and entertainment on the frozen river. During the last Frost Fair in 1814, an elephant famously walked across the ice by Blackfriars Bridge. It's a scene recreated in an episode of Dr Who, which gets an outdoor screening as part of the revived [Frost Fair](https://banksidelondon.co.uk/frost-fair/) on Bankside this month. Back for a second year, the event includes music and entertainment, guided tours with a Frost Fair theme, and a parade with a life-size puppet elephant. Visitors can also take a free craft workshop, shop at an artisan market, take a horse and carriage ride beside the Thames, or play traditional games such as skittles. The Frost Fair Fringe will see Bankside businesses recreate food, drink, and activities associated with the historic fair, including hot apples, gingerbread, mulled wine and hot chocolate, plus drinks you may never have heard of like ‘Old Tom Gin’ and ‘Hot Purl’. (Gin and wormwood wine which is similar to vermouth) Organised by Business Improvement District (BID) [Better Bankside](https://betterbankside.co.uk/), the three day event is a welcome opportunity to chase away the winter blues with activities, spectacles, and themed feasting, bringing alive the area and its businesses. Nicole Gordon CEO of Better Bankside said; “We are incredibly excited to be hosting Bankside’s second Frost Fair. The activities and events will spark joy for everyone at an often gloomy time of year. \"It is wonderfully nostalgic to recreate an event which is so unique in Bankside’s rich history. But aside from just looking back, the Frost Fair resonates with the spirit of ‘London’s Other Side’ today. When the river froze, the fair not only provided entertainment, it also supported the local community through offering much-needed employment for out of work bargemen. \"The mentality of community, creativity and resilience is still very much alive and well today amongst Banksiders. The Frost Fair is one of the ways we can share Bankside, as an area and community, with others.\" Taking place on Sumner Street behind the Tate Modern the Frost Fair runs from Friday 26 January to Sunday 28 January. Events are free but the BID is encouraging donations to help ‘freeze out homelessness’ for the [Manna Society](https://www.mannasociety.org.uk/), a local day centre working with the homeless and vulnerable.",

    "text": "[Weather](https://www.laprensalatina.com/category/weather/) 7 dead in south Thailand flooding Bangkok, Dec 29 (EFE).- Torrential rains have triggered severe flooding in southern Thailand, claiming seven lives and affecting thousands of people, authorities said Friday. The casualties were reported from the Narathiwat province that has borne the brunt, with water levels exceeding two meters in some areas. One person was missing as search operations are on. More than 260,000 people have been affected by the flooding, according to data from the government’s disaster management agency. Rescue efforts are underway. The water level exceeded two meters in some villages in Narathiwat, where residents took shelter on rooftops or upper floors of their houses, waiting for help from emergency services. Flood waters have already started receding little by little, while neighboring provinces of Yala and Pattani have also been affected, the public broadcaster Thai PBS reported. The floods forced the closure of some of roads that connect the region and the temporary suspension of the railway services, which has now resumed its normal activity. Some regions in neighboring Malaysia were also hit, and some 28,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, according to official data. Although the water level has begun to recede in some areas, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that heavy rains would continue over the weekend. EFE nc-ssk",

    "text": "Ukrainian Strike Hits Russian Landing Ship Novocherkassk in Crimea\nSatellite imagery has unveiled the significant damage sustained by the Russian tank landing ship Novocherkassk following an offensive by Ukrainian forces on a port situated in Crimea. The visuals, provided by Maxar Technologies, showcase the aftermath of the attack with the vessel appearing to be engulfed in smoke, disconnected from the dock, and partially submerged in water.\nThis incident marks a key moment in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, demonstrating their capability to strike high-value targets. Ukraine has declared success in destroying the Novocherkassk at the port of Feodosia—a claim countered by Moscow, asserting only damage occurred. Prior satellite images capture the ship before the strike, fully intact, highlighting the extent of the inflicted damages post-attack.\nA Ukrainian Navy spokesperson expressed difficulties in obtaining precise casualty figures given the Russian occupation of Crimea. Nonetheless, the realistic possibility of crew casualties was noted, considering the full capacity of the ship usually hosts about 80 people.\nThe Novocherkassk, a Ropucha-class landing ship detailed in a US military fact sheet, is quite substantial, equivalent in size to a US Navy littoral combat ship. Its design supports beach landings and can carry a crew complement of approximately 87 personnel, with additional capacity for 237 troops.\nFurther adding to the strategic significance of this strike, the Ukrainian Air Force commander reported that the Novocherkassk had been transporting Iranian-made Shahed attack drones. This incident follows the previous sinking of the Moskva, another principal vessel of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, reinforcing Ukraine’s resolve against Russian military resources.\nWhile Russia’s Defense Ministry has acknowledged the events, firm verification of the attack’s details remains challenging. Despite this, reports from Russian authorities confirm at least one casualty and several injuries due to the offensive. The attack denotes another considerable setback for Russian military operations, coinciding with Ukraine’s persistent defense in the east and the potential threat to the strategic city of Avdiivka. The ongoing conflict continues to exhibit high-stakes encounters with repercussions on both sides.\nFAQs about the Attack on the Russian Landing Ship Novocherkassk\nWhat happened to the Russian tank landing ship, Novocherkassk?\nSatellite imagery showed significant damage to the Russian tank landing ship Novocherkassk following an attack by Ukrainian forces on a port in Crimea. The imagery depicted the ship with smoke, disconnected from the dock, and partially submerged.\nWho provided the satellite images, and what do they show?\nMaxar Technologies provided the satellite images showing the damaged vessel after the attack.\nWhat does this incident signify for the Ukrainian counteroffensive?\nThis incident illustrates Ukraine’s ability to strike high-value targets effectively and is considered a key moment in their counteroffensive efforts.\nHas there been any confirmation of casualties?\nPrecise casualty figures are hard to obtain due to Russian occupation, but considering the ship’s typical crew complement, there is a realistic possibility of crew casualties.\nWhat is the Novocherkassk, and what can it do?\nThe Novocherkassk is a Ropucha-class landing ship of substantial size, similar to a US Navy littoral combat ship and designed for beach landings. It can carry about 87 crew members and an additional 237 troops.\nWas the Novocherkassk carrying any significant cargo?\nAccording to the Ukrainian Air Force commander, it was reported to be transporting Iranian-made Shahed attack drones at the time of the attack.\nWhat has been Russia’s response to the attack?\nThe Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the event, confirmed at least one casualty and several injuries, but details and the full extent of the damage remain challenging to verify.\nWhat is the impact of this attack on the wider conflict?\nThe attack contributes to setbacks for Russian military operations and highlights the ongoing high-stakes nature of the conflict, with both sides facing significant repercussions.\nDefinitions of Key Terms:\n– Ropucha-class landing ship: A class of landing ship used by the Russian Navy, designed for beach landings and capable of carrying large numbers of troops and vehicles.\n– Littoral combat ship: A class of relatively small surface vessels used by the US Navy for operations near the shore (littorals).\n– Shahed attack drones: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) produced in Iran and used for various military applications, including reconnaissance and combat.\nRelated Links:\n–\nMaxar Technologies – Provider of the satellite imagery showing the aftermath of the attack.\n–\nRussian Defense Ministry – Official site of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.\n–\nUS Navy – Regarding information on the US Navy’s littoral combat ships for comparison purposes.\nPlease note that websites listed are based on their relevance to the article’s content, their main domains, and provided that the URLs are deemed valid at the time of this writing.\nNatalia Toczkowska is a notable figure in digital health technology, recognized for her contributions in advancing telemedicine and healthcare apps.
