Con mantas y megáfono, el diputado Ernesto Prieto lideró el movimiento de diputados federales, quienes fueron abucheados por los trabajadores del Poder Judicial quienes imposibilitaron que pudiese llevarse a cabo su posicionamiento. La tensión escaló a tal grado que Prieto Gallardo retó a jueces y magistrados a un debate público para discutir la propuesta de reforma, a lo cual Armando Díaz López Coordinador de magistrados del Poder Judicial Federal en Guanajuato salió a responder. La fecha ya fue fijada y se llevará a cabo el próximo 2 de septiembre en la sede central del edificio de Derecho de la Universidad de Guanajuato. Te podría interesar Jueces están en su derecho de protestar; Diego Sinhue Diego Sinhue Rodríguez Vallejo, gobernador del estado de Guanajuato, declaró que los jueces están en su derecho de manifestarse con un paro laboral para defender su empleo. Lo anterior dijo tras registrarse el paro nacional en todos los juzgados del Poder Judicial, dentro de los cuales, participaron sólo por algunas horas, los trabajadores de las oficinas en León, Guanajuato, Irapuato, San Miguel de Allende y Celaya. El mandatario pidió a la población ser pacientes y apoyar a los jueces y los trabajadores del Poder Judicial, y destacó que en el estado de Guanajuato la mayoría de los trabajadores regresaron a sus labores en favor de los ciudadanos. Asimismo, recordó que la protesta busca un mejor poder judicial y defender los derechos laborales.",

    "title": "Matt Walsh reveals more of the Nashville shooter's 'manifesto'",
    "text": "The other day, we talked about how the Daily Mail had gotten a copy of at least some Audrey Hale’s (a.k.a. the Nashville Transgender Shooter) so called manifesto. And, today, Matt Walsh has more of it.\nExcept before we dig in, we think we have to correct the record. What this actually seems to be is writings in a diary, as opposed to a well-thought-out document that tells you specifically why she did this. Such a document can give you a strong idea why she did it, it’s not the same thing as a document that says “this is why I am going to shoot up this school.”\nAlso, this all comes with a LANGUAGE WARNING. Besides using a lot of curse words, she also talks about doing some things that are not safe for work.\nWith stuffed animals.\nFor hours.\nSo … totally normal stuff.\nBut with that aside, here’s the thread where Walsh revealed what he had:\n2/ In one passage, the shooter rails against “Christian friends” that her parents have encouraged her to make. She writes, “Parents actually believe religion can change nature. That could explain why I don’t practice religion anymore. Let kids think for themselves.” pic.twitter.com/04xRXvBspj\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\nWe have seen a lot of people on the left try to argue that “animals do X, therefore there is nothing wrong with humans doing X” as a form of logic. Reasoning from animal behavior seems like the opposite of good morality. For instance, many animals will eat their young. Does it follow that it is right for humans to eat their young?\nThen again, maybe we don’t want to hear a leftist’s answer to that question.\n4/ Separately, she writes: “F*ck parents like them [who oppose trans ideology] who think of themselves first, and their preference of conservative religion…” and how she’d “kill to have had parents” who’d have given her so-called “puberty blockers” as a child. pic.twitter.com/ozktZoPalB\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n6/ That’s one of the many problems with radical gender ideology. The people least able to navigate their own care — children and cognitively impaired adults — are not just unintentional casualties. They are the targets. They seek answers, and gender ideology comes knocking.\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n8/ Recall that, in the wake of this shooting, the White House claimed that trans people — not the murdered Christians — were “under attack.” They didn't want you to realize that, in her own words, the shooter had described her disdain for Christians very clearly.\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n10/ The writings are distressing and highly emotional. At one point, she states, “Puberty = life sentence. The people in this world adds more bullets to shoot violent thoughts into my head on full-auto. I hate parental views; how my mom sees me as a daughter.” pic.twitter.com/CMg21VBqNH\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\nThe bit about giving her stuffed dolls fake genitals recalls this bit from the Daily Mail’s article about parts of these writings:\nTony was her 'stuffed boy doll' which she wrote 'is like the boy I am in another form.'\nShe simulated intercourse between Tony and another soft toy over the course of hours, she wrote.\nShe even took photos of the scene and lost track of time.\n'God, I am such a pervert.' Hale wrote, 'I waste too much time in my fantasies.'\nHonestly, how does a person spend hours doing this sort of thing? And this is a 28-year-old woman.\n12/ Instead of worshiping God, the shooter states that she sees herself as a kind of deity. “Having a brain like mine has its godliness,” she writes at one point. pic.twitter.com/zWer23YOT1\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n14/ The FBI has never presented a clear answer as to why they hid these writings. In court, they claimed that active criminal investigations preclude releasing the documents, even though there are no other suspects in the shooting.\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\nThe active investigations line seems particularly lame. Hey, FBI, we think we know who did the shooting!\n16/ For its part, Vanderbilt University Medical Center – which reportedly treated the shooter for more than two decades – has remained silent on how, exactly, they were handling the shooter’s care. In fact, they haven’t responded to media inquiries at all.\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n18/ This is a national scandal. In this case, transparency can save lives. There have been several other shootings and planned shootings involving trans suspects since the mass killings in Nashville, and there will likely be many more unless something changes.\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n20/ For now, this is the information we have: pic.twitter.com/r3LlYJPWfZ\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\n21/ If the FBI is concerned about “false narratives,” the only reasonable solution is to release the manifesto. My full thoughts here: https://t.co/3uhuzLj8b4\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 12, 2024\nOf course, these documents strongly suggest that she was motivated by transgender ideology/hatred of Christianity. But for the left, that will only confirm how correct transgender ideology is. They will say this person is so oppressed by our intolerance that it drove them to murder. Expect statements such as 'sure, what she did was wrong, but...' When the left agrees with a cause, anything is justified, even the murder of children.\nBut bluntly, if somehow Hale had survived the shooting, we think it would be appropriate to charge her with having committed hate crime. At this point, it is almost impossible to see this shooting as anything other than that.\nFinally, it is past time for all of the documents to be revealed. We won’t say that there is no possibility of a valid redaction, but they should be few and far between, and each redaction should be justified in writing, each time, and in detail.",

    "text": "A Course in Miracles (ACIM), a religious and philosophical text, is really a profound perform that has had an important affect the lives of countless persons seeking a greater comprehension of themselves and the type of reality. Comprising over 1200 pages of heavy product, ACIM is a unique and extensive manual to internal change, forgiveness, and spiritual awakening. It had been scribed by Helen Schucman, a research psychologist, and first published in 1976, and it remains to resonate with individuals from all guides of life. At the key of A Course in Miracles is a non-denominational method of spirituality that encourages students to question their preconceived notions about fact, the self, and the world. The writing is divided into three a course in miracles podcast components: the Text, the Workbook for Students, and the Handbook for Teachers, each supplying a different perception on the product presented. The core teachings of ACIM could be distilled in to many important principles. One of the key subjects of ACIM is the thought of forgiveness. The Course teaches that forgiveness isn't simply pardoning somebody for his or her wrongdoings, but instead, it is the acceptance that there surely is nothing to forgive. It asserts that what we see as wrongdoings are ultimately the consequence of our personal misperceptions and projections. In forgiving others, we're, in fact, flexible ourselves. ACIM emphasizes that forgiveness is really a way to inner peace and liberation from the burdens of resentment and anger. Still another basic concept of A Program in Miracles could be the idea that the physical world is an illusion. It posits which our physical activities are unreliable signals of reality and that true perception can only just be achieved through a shift in consciousness. The Course distinguishes involving the \"real-world,\" which is a state of peace and oneness beyond the material realm, and the \"ego world,\" characterized by fear, separation, and conflict. In accordance with ACIM, our major function is to wake from the desire of the confidence earth and come back to the understanding of our divine nature. ACIM also presents the notion of the Sacred Nature as helpful tips and teacher within the individual. That religious existence is observed as the origin of creativity and wisdom, helping us make possibilities that lead us closer to reality and from illusion. The Program shows that through our willingness to listen to the Sacred Spirit's advice, we are able to access a further knowledge of our function and the path to healing. The Book for Pupils in A Program in Miracles includes 365 instructions, one for every single time of the year. These classes are created to support students internalize the teachings and use them for their day-to-day lives. They frequently contain meditative and contemplative exercises, affirmations, and reflections on the ideas shown in the text. The objective of these daily instructions would be to change the student's belief and mindset slowly, leading them towards circumstances of correct forgiveness, inner peace, and religious awakening.",
