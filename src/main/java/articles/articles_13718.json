    "text": "Raposa faz sete contratações nesta janela de transferências, e proprietário da SAF cobra titularidades O proprietário da SAF do Cruzeiro , Pedro Lourenço, deu um ultimato a técnico Fernando Seabra. Em áudio vazado antes do jogo entre Raposa e Juventude , nessa quarta-feira (24), o empresário cobra a titularidade dos reforços contratados nesta janela. \"Eu cheguei para o técnico (Fernando Seabra) e falei assim: 'Ou você escala os jogadores que contratou ou você pode arrumando a sua mala aí que não passa desse jogo não'. Falei com ele que se não precisasse desses jogadores eu não teria contratado e ficaria só com os que estão aqui. Aí dei uma dura nele do caramba\", afirmou. Cruzeiro investiu pesado na janela de transferências - Foto: Gustavo Aleixo/Cruzeiro O áudio viralizou em Belo Horizonte e circula pelos aplicativos de mensagens. Ele ainda ressalta que os reforços são caros. \"Vai jogar hoje no ataque com o Lautaro, que é o argentino que veio, e o Kaio Jorge. O Matheus Henrique no meio, e o Walace vai ficar no banco porque ainda não está 100%. Mas vão jogar três dos contratados, vão sair de titular. Vamos ver o que vai dar. Tem que melhorar, pois os caras tão saindo caro. Você acha que eu dou mole, parti para cima dele (risos)\", completou. Assim, pelos áudios que são atribuídos a Pedrinho BH, a formação inicial mudou. No entanto, as mudanças já aconteceriam. Afinal, Álvaro Barreal estava suspenso pelo terceiro cartão amarelo e Gabriel Veron sofreu uma lesão na coxa esquerda. O Cruzeiro venceu a partida sobre o Juventude, por 2 a 0, na noite de quarta-feira, no Mineirão. Siga nosso conteúdo nas redes sociais: Twitter, Instagram e Facebook.",

    "text": "President Trump just sat down with John Solomon for a brand new interview and it was great and wide-ranging… Newsmaker Interview: Trump puts Iran, Europeans and antisemites on notice, dispels Nikki rumors [https://t.co/l5pBAK59BZ] — Just the News (@JustTheNews) [December 28, 2023] From [JustTheNews](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/newsmaker-interview-trump-puts-iran-europeans-and-antisemites?utm_source=mux&utm_medium=social): Former President Donald Trump is sending some pointed messages to friends and foes alike: No, Nikki Haley is not on his vice presidential list because there isn’t one right now. Yes, if he returns to the White House European countries had better get ready to pay more for the Ukraine war. And both federal agencies and nonprofits that espouse antisemitic views and threaten Jews should prepare to lose federal funding or even their tax-exempt status. In a wide-ranging interview with Just the News, the 45th president surveyed the sort of policies he’ll pursue if voters return him to office next November as the nation’s 47th president. He made clear securing the U.S. southern border is a top priority as is cutting off the sources of income from oil sales and reclaiming the unfrozen funds that he says has revived Iran’s terrorism activities across the globe on Joe Biden’s watch. Those activities include recent rocket and drone attacks from proxy groups targeting U.S. troops. The United States said Tuesday that it had shot down 12 attack drones and five missiles launched by the Iran-backed Houthis. “Iran was allowed to get rich because Joe Biden allowed them to,” Trump told the “Just the News, No Noise” television show on Real America’s Voice. “So he could say whatever he wants. But he’s the reason for this. He’s an incompetent president. He’s a compromised president, totally compromised. But he allowed them to get rich.” “But worse than being rich, because of the money, because of what they have, they will have within a short period of time nuclear weapons,” Trump added. “And that is never something that can be allowed to happen.” Trump made clear he plans to return U.S.-Iran policy to a strict regimen of sanctions to choke off any funding for Tehran to use on weapons or terrorism support. “Iran was broke. They didn’t have any money to get around. I put sanctions on. I put everything on, and told countries, China, many countries, India, France, ‘don’t buy oil … you buy any oil, we’re not going to do business with you. And we’re going to put tariffs on all the products that do get through, We’re not going to do business,’” Trump said, contrasting his policies with Biden’s. “They didn’t have money for Hezbollah. And this would have never happened, it also wouldn’t have happened because they knew the consequences would have been much different than what you see right now,” he added. In the aftermath of controversial congressional testimony from Ivy League university bosses who refused to say they would punish antisemitic behavior by students, Trump also said he would use the power of the purse if re-elected to punish government agencies and nonprofits whose actions or words threaten Jews. “I would use that power and I use it very strongly and very powerfully,” he said when asked about potentially taking away federal funding or tax exemptions from entities that engaged in antisemitic behavior. Turning his attention to the primary race with the Iowa caucuses less than three weeks away, Trump directly disputed media speculation he might consider challenger Nikki Haley, his former U.N. ambassador, for vice president. He said he has no short list at all right now because he focused on winning the primaries. “No, I’m not considering anybody at this point,” the former president said. “Look, I want to win. And one thing I will say, and I’ve watched this for a long time, the vice president has virtually no impact. You can go back all throughout history, whoever the choice of vice president says virtually no impact as to who is going to get a nomination to get elected.” Trump said he believes he had a good rapport with Haley but felt she was a bit disloyal when she decided to run against him. “Nikki, I know very well. And I actually got along with very well, and she wasn’t going to run. She said I was a great president and she would not run as long as I ran. And then one day she decided to run. So you know, I thought that was somewhat disloyal,” he said. “… So I was a little bit surprised at that. But that’s a politician.”Advertisement Watch the full video here: President Trump’s FULL Interview with John Solomon, JustTheNews [pic.twitter.com/98Low4YopP] — DailyNoah.com (@DailyNoahNews) [December 28, 2023] This is a Guest Post from our friends over at WLTReport.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "New Illinois law leads nation with safety requirements for carbon capture, sequestration",
    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) — Gov. JB Pritzker signed a plan into law Thursday setting the highest standards in the nation for [environmental safety in carbon capture](https://www.wandtv.com/news/illinois-lawmakers-stand-alongside-coalition-ready-for-carbon-capture-expansion/article_c906dd08-e30d-11ee-985f-8b1a35a12929.html), pipelines and sequestration. The Pritzker administration says the legislation could generate $9 billion and 3,700 new jobs for Illinois. \"The concept is simple,\" said Sen. Bill Cunningham (D-Chicago). \"We're trying to capture carbon emissions at their source of emissions and return that carbon to the ground from which it came. We are essentially trying to re-fossilize fossil fuels.\" While the transition to green energy is inevitable, Pritzker said Illinois needs to use every tool to slow down emissions and address climate change. \"Every marginal reduction in planetary warming that we can achieve, every fraction of a percent, represents billions of dollars of savings for our economy here and likely thousands of lives across the nation,\" Pritzker said at the [National Sequestration Education Center](https://www.wandtv.com/news/council-approves-adm-co2-sequestration-project/article_d6675e1c-c790-11ed-ae3a-5b6463d34c14.html) at Richland Community College. This law requires carbon capture companies to achieve a net reduction in greenhouse gases and conduct water, air and soil monitoring to ensure no leaks occur. ADM has been at the forefront of carbon capture since 2011. The company injects carbon dioxide underground at its corn processing plant in Decatur through a collaboration with the University of Illinois and U.S. Department of Energy. \"CCS is an enabler for job creation, innovation and economic growth,\" said Chris Cuddy, ADM Senior Vice President of Carbohydrate Solutions. \"The more we do to support it, from this legislation to the building of critical infrastructure, the more this region and the state will benefit.\" This plan also establishes a two-year moratorium on CO2 pipelines so the state can wait for federal safety and oversight rules. However, not everyone is happy about [the new law](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/103/PDF/103-0651.pdf). Sen. Chapin Rose (R-Mahomet) said Pritzker ignored clear dangers posed by storing CO2 beneath the Mahomet Aquifer. Rose argued that the bill's signing is a failure of environmental stewardship and a reckless gamble with our public health. \"We based it on the science, and the data, and the modeling that we had access to,\" said Rep. Ann Williams (D-Chicago). \"So, we felt very comfortable about how we were providing safeguards to drill not just through the aquifer but anywhere in the state of Illinois. It was all science-based and not based on talking points or fearmongering or anything else we heard on the floor debate.\" The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said this law will take critical steps toward ensuring Illinois communities, land and water are protected from the risks of carbon capture. The Illinois Manufacturers' Association also thanked the Pritzker administration, sponsors and stakeholders in agriculture and labor for getting the plan across the finish line this session. \"This law smartly and safely advances carbon capture and storage in Illinois, which will help increase economic development, advance our clean energy goals and create new jobs,\" said IMA President and CEO Mark Denzler. \"This is proof that by working together, we can decarbonize our environment without deindustrializing our economy.\" Copyright 2024.

    "text": "El DOGE indicó en su mensaje que se revisarán el 1% de los mejores currículums que reciban a través de mensajes directos en la plataforma X.\nEl magnate Elon Musk lanzó este jueves 14 de noviembre un anuncio en redes sociales para reclutar a superdotados dispuestos a trabajar más de 80 horas semanales en el Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental (DOGE, en inglés), que dirigirá para asesorar al presidente electo, Donald Trump, en recortes del gasto público.\n\"Necesitamos revolucionarios de alto coeficiente intelectual dispuestos a trabajar más de 80 horas a la semana en la reducción de costes\", detalló el DOGE en un mensaje publicado en X, red social de la que Musk es dueño.\nTe recomendamos\nCreación del DOGE en Estados Unidos\nEl nuevo departamento estará dirigido por Elon Musk y el empresario trumpista Vivek Ramaswamy, quien participó en las primarias por la nominación republicana.\nEl DOGE indicó en su mensaje que Musk y Ramaswamy revisarán el 1 % de los mejores currículums que reciban a través de mensajes directos en la plataforma X.\nTrump anunció el martes la creación de esta oficina que \"brindará asesoramiento y orientación desde fuera del gobierno y se asociará con la Casa Blanca y la Oficina de Administración y Presupuesto para impulsar reformas estructurales a gran escala y crear un enfoque empresarial para el gobierno nunca antes visto\".\nLa misión del DOGE concluirá a más tardar el 4 de julio de 2026, cuando se cumplan 250 años de la independencia de Estados Unidos.\nEl nombramiento de Musk al frente de esta oficina era un secreto a voces desde la campaña, aunque sorprendió el anuncio de Ramaswamy como codirector. El hecho de nombrar a dos personas para dirigir una oficina de eficiencia ha sido motivo de crítica y burla en redes sociales.\nComparte esta noticia",
