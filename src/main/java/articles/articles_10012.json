    "text": "- Ensysce Biosciences (\nENSC,Financial) has announced the exercise of warrants amounting to $2.2 million in gross proceeds. - New unregistered warrants are issued for up to 1,260,752 shares at an exercise price of $1.90 per share.\n- Proceeds will aid in the continued development of the company's TAAP™ and MPAR® programs.\nEnsysce Biosciences, Inc. (ENSC), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, has announced a significant financial development through the execution of outstanding warrants. This transaction is expected to generate approximately $2.2 million in gross proceeds, a crucial cash infusion for the company, representing a substantial portion of its market capitalization.\nThe agreement involves the immediate exercise of warrants to purchase 630,376 shares of common stock at $3.24 per share. In return, Ensysce Biosciences will issue new unregistered warrants for up to 1,260,752 shares at a significantly reduced exercise price of $1.90 per share. These warrants are divided into two terms: half with an 18-month term and the other half with a 5-year term. The exercise price is notably lower than the current stock price, potentially leading to future dilution if the new warrants are exercised.\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. serves as the exclusive placement agent for this offering. The transaction is anticipated to close around April 24, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The company plans to utilize the proceeds for the advancement of its proprietary TAAP™ and MPAR® programs and for working capital purposes, which are vital for Ensysce's mission to create tamper-proof pain treatments that mitigate the risk of opioid abuse and overdose.",

    "text": "Sports\nBlue Jackets Have Miraculously Gone From Basement Team Into a Playoff Contender\nThere's no telling where it came from, but it's the biggest story in the 2024-25 NHL season.\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets have shot into the stratosphere from being projected as one of the worst teams in the league to a legitimate playoff threat.\nColumbus rides a five-game win streak heading into Thursday's puck drop against the San Jose Sharks.\nThe team has faced a wave of injuries to key players but has still managed to record a 8-2-1 record over their last 11 games. They currently sit in the second wild-card spot for the Stanley Cup Playoffs in the Eastern Conference.\nThe offense is compensating for any deficiencies at 5-on-5 play, ranking No. 7 overall in goals and generating a top-10 power play unit.\nMore NHL:NHL Award Predictions: Canucks' Quinn Hughes Leads Way For Norris Trophy\nMuch of this is on the back of a Norris Trophy-worthy season from Zach Werenski, who leads the team with 50 points in 44 games.\nThen there's three forwards all vastly outperforming expectations in Sean Monahan, Kirill Marchenko and Dmitri Voronkov — each of which owns plus ratings and owns 41, 48 and 30 points, respectively.\nThe Athletic's Pierre LeBrun points out that at the start of the season, Werenski appeared to be a No. 1 defenseman with some defensive flaws, while the other three seemed like solid middle-six forwards. Together, their Net Rating was a respectable plus-10.8. Since then, it has skyrocketed to plus-46.2, reflecting their exceptional performance.\n\"I think the thing I'm most proud of is just how hard we work every night and how we do it for each other,\" Werenski said. \"It's been awesome.\"\nWerenski has solidified himself as a clear top-10, possibly even top-five, defenseman, while the three forwards have elevated their game to become bona fide top-line players. This success is highlighted by the trio outscoring opponents 22-5 and controlling 60 percent of expected goals, making them one of the most dominant lines in hockey.\nOn Dec. 18, the Blue Jackets ranked 26th in the NHL standings and trailed a wild-card spot by five points. After dropping eight of their last nine games, the playoffs seemed increasingly out of reach. They have gone 9-3 ever since.\nIt's a team that's adapting after mistakes and finding different ways to win no matter the circumstance. Their gritty 3-2 shootout victory against the Flyers on Tuesday was a testament to that.\n\"The guys, you have to play in different ways,\" head coach Dean Evason said after the win. \"It was just a grinding, in the mud, muck game, and both teams were committed. It was a good hockey game.\"\nThere's plenty of ways to assess why the Jackets have boosted into relevance on paper, but there's the emotional narrative that is also considered. In the wake of Johnny Gaudreau's sudden and tragic passing in August, the Blue Jackets have rallied around the superstar's memory this season.\nMore NHL:Islanders Expected to Part Ways With Brock Nelson at Trade Deadline\n\"I think coming into the year before John's passing, I think it was refreshing to have new management, new coaches,\" Werenski said. \"I think there was a lot of excitement just within our room, just to kind of have a new feel. We all kind of knew what we could be. It was just doing it. And then obviously with the circumstances and what happened, you're never really too sure how a team or a group is going to respond.\"\nGaudreau and his brother, Matthew, passed away on Aug. 29 after being struck by a car while cycling in their hometown of Salem County, New Jersey. Heartbroken, the team came together for a candlelight vigil in Columbus on Sept. 4 and attended the funeral in Media, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 9. Training camp began shortly after, on Sept. 18.\nThe Blue Jackets continue to fight for Johnny, Matthew and the Gaudreau family as they embark on a four-game road trip beginning in New York against the Rangers on Saturday.\nMore NHL:\nOilers Favored to Land Highly Sought-After Defenseman\nLeafs Predicted to Sign Big Name Center Before Trade Deadline\nFor more on the NHL, head to Newsweek Sports.\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 16, 2025 at 2:18 PM.",
