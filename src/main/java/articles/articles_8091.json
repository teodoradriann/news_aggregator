    "title": "What Does a Rainbow Really Mean in the Bible? - Beliefnet",
    "text": "People typically associate rainbows with [hope](https://www.beliefnet.com/wellness/health/increase-hope.aspx), and for a good reason. They are a symbol of hope in many cultures. Rainbows show up during rainstorms when the sun shines onto water droplets. This shatters its white light into a display of brilliant colors. For many Christians, the rainbow is a sign that there are better days to come. To understand the true meaning of rainbows to Christians, we should turn to the Bible. Scripture first mentions rainbows in the book of Genesis at the end of the story about the flood story. The Bible says, “And God said, ‘This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth” (Genesis 9:12-13). As a result of the constant evil and wickedness of mankind, God decided to cause rain to fall for 40 days and 40 nights to flood the entire earth. When several months of interesting events had taken place, God’s judgment calmed, and the rain stopped. This is when the rainbow first appeared in the sky. When the floodwaters receded, and Noah was able to get out of the boat onto dry land, he created an altar and offered a burnt offering to God. God replied with a declaration, a promise the Noah and his family. Genesis 14-16 says, “Whenever I bring clouds over the earth, and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” From this passage, we see that God gave special meaning to the rainbow, so whenever we do see it, we are reminded of God’s covenant – to never destroy the earth again with a flood. Ultimately, one of the most important takeaways from this story and the rainbow symbol is that it shows us God's grace and the purpose of redemption. God spared not only Noah but also his family. He gives us, humanity, the same opportunity to begin again. In addition to God putting a rainbow in the clouds after the flood, there are two other places where rainbows are mentioned in Scripture. This is in the book of Ezekiel and Revelation. When Ezekiel began to see visions of God, he said, “Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 1:28). There is also the reference in the book of Revelation. When John was on the island of Patmos, he saw a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald (Revelation 4:3). He later saw a vision of “an angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire” (Revelation 10:1). From these two passages, the rainbow is seen as a symbol of Christ. John sees Christ clothed with a cloud and a rainbow on His head. We also see the rainbow as a true sign of hope in the face of judgment. The rainbow in Noah's days symbolized how God’s glory could penetrate the clouds of judgment. We ultimately see that when tragedy occurs in our lives, we can have full confidence that God will restore us. God’s biblical promises are real, and His grace can truly conquer sin. Through Jesus’ redemption, He was crowned with the sign of the covenant of grace. The rainbow is a reminder of God’s constant presence in our lives. We know that God can destroy the earth, but we also know that He can start things anew. Yes, the rainbow is symbolic of hope, but it also a sign of God’s complete authority in our lives. There is hope in our obedience to God. Now, when you see a rainbow in the sky, you won’t just think of it as a symbol of “good luck” and make a wish. The truth is God judges sin. We see this through the story of a global flood in the days of Noah. Yet, we also see that God is merciful, making a covenant of grace. When we look at the rainbow as a symbol of Christ, we see that those who receive Him also receive the gift of salvation and grace. You can see it as a sign of hope for all future generations, as God intended it to be. Let that rainbow remind you of God’s inexpressible beauty and His covenant-keeping nature.",

    "title": "Batteri Killer, una pandemia silente. Schillaci: no “fai da te” e disinformazione. Governo in prima linea con fondi, ricerca, corsi",
    "text": "Batteri killer e antibiotico-resistenza , il ministro Schillaci non fa sconti sulla situazione, e ospite a Unomattina su Raiuno afferma senza giri di parole: «L’Italia ha un Servizio Sanitario Nazionale che tutti gli altri Paesi ci invidiano, però purtroppo siamo agli ultimi posti in Europa per quanto riguarda la lotta all’antibiotico-resistenza. È importante ricordare che gli antibiotici vanno presi quando è necessario sempre sotto una stretta guida medica, non bisogna assolutamente usare il fai-da-te in questo campo così delicato perché gli antibiotici usati in maniera non adeguata causano una resistenza e quindi alcune malattie che possono essere curate, come la polmonite, magari diventano più difficili da affrontare ».\nBatteri killer e antibiotico resistenza, Schillaci: dal governo 21 milioni di euro nella legge di bilancio per la ricerca Di più: secondo l’Oms nel 2050 l’antibiotico-resistenza potrebbe provocare oltre 39 milioni di morti al mondo . Pertanto, ha proseguito il ministro, «dobbiamo scongiurare assolutamente questo pericolo». E il governo è più che pronto e si è attrezzato a dovere: «Ci stiamo impegnando – ha ribadito Schillaci ancora oggi –. Sono stati messi 21 milioni di euro nella legge di bilancio per favorire la ricerca di nuovi antibiotici che siano in grado di sconfiggere batteri che sono diventati resistenti ai tradizionali antibiotici . Però ci vuole l’impegno di tutti: è una battaglia da fare insieme », ha sottolineato il ministro.\nAntibiotico-resistenza, al via corsi di formazione specifici per medici di famiglia e ospedali E ancora. «I dati che abbiamo in nostro possesso testimoniano come spesso proprio nelle età più fragili – le persone più anziane. Oppure i pazienti in età pediatrica – c’è un uso eccessivo di antibiotici: per questo, stiamo partendo con dei corsi di formazione specifici, rivolti in particolare ai medici di famiglia» , che «hanno il più stretto rapporto con i cittadini: tocca a loro essere la guida per un uso responsabile degli antibiotici in tutte le fasce di età . La cosa migliore è sempre rivolgersi al medico, bisogna evitare le auto-prescrizioni e l’auto-somministrazione ».\nBatteri killer, attenzione ai fragili tra gli anziani, soggetti con patologie gravi e pazienti in età pediatrica Non solo. Negli ospedali – ha sottolineato Schillaci – «bisogna avere particolare attenzione, soprattutto per i pazienti fragili, i più anziani o quelli che hanno delle patologie gravi. Proprio a loro bisogna somministrare gli antibiotici quando è necessario». Per il ministro «è un aspetto non solo che riguarda la salute , ma anche economico, perché ovviamente si dilatano i tempi di presenza delle persone all’interno degli ospedali: dobbiamo evitarlo, anche perché i soldi che si possono risparmiare da una battaglia come quella che stiamo conducendo insieme possono essere utilizzati, per esempio, per dare accesso ai pazienti alle nuove terapie oncologiche», ha concluso.\nNon solo batteri killer e antibiotico resistenza: «La disinformazione danneggia il Ssn» Una battaglia, quella sanitaria, che si scontra anche e sempre più spesso con un altro grande nemico che sempre il ministro della Salute ha voluto esplicitare e denunciare: «La diffusione di dati non verificati e la strumentalizzazione propagandistica di casi isolati – ha spiegato il titolare del dicastero della Salute – rappresentano un danno grave per il Servizio Sanitario Nazionale. Per gli operatori sanitari. E per tutti i cittadini italiani». Pertanto, ha quindi aggiunto, «è necessario ribadire con fermezza che, dall’insediamento del Governo Meloni, non è stato effettuato alcun taglio alla sanità pubblica . Al contrario, stiamo portando avanti un intenso lavoro di riforma per rafforzare un settore che ha subito anni di depauperamento . La continua diffusione di dati inattendibili e la generalizzazione di casi singoli, sia riguardo alle liste d’attesa che agli scioperi o ai fondi, non fa altro che alimentare una narrazione distorta della realtà »\n«Dati inattendibili e la generalizzazione su liste d’attesa, scioperi o fondi, alimentano una narrazione distorta della realtà» Il ministro poi sottolinea come «siamo consapevoli che riformare un settore così complesso richieda tempo e dedizione, ma i primi risultati del nostro lavoro sono già visibili. Abbiamo invertito la tendenza negativa degli anni precedenti e stiamo procedendo con determinazione verso il miglioramento del sistema. In questo percorso – ha così concluso Schillaci – chiediamo la collaborazione costruttiva delle organizzazioni sindacali per vigilare nei casi di troppe e inaccettabili scorrettezze nelle strutture sanitarie che ci raccontano purtroppo quotidianamente i media. Solo attraverso un dialogo basato su dati oggettivi e una cooperazione finalizzata al bene comune possiamo garantire un servizio sanitario sempre più efficiente e vicino ai cittadini ».",

Es el primer caso con síntomas graves detectado en el país. El Departamento de Agricultura federal estima que en California, el Estado más poblado del país, hay unas 645 cabezas de ganado infectadas con el virus H5N1, detectado desde agosto pasado.
