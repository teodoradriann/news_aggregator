    "title": "Nepal signs power export deal with Bangladesh and India",
    "text": "Nepal signed an agreement with Bangladesh on Thursday to export 40 megawatts of hydroelectricity annually via India as the Himalayan nation seeks to tap into its snow-fed rivers to power its economy. Nepal currently has installed capacity of more than 3,200 megawatts from over 150 projects, with over 200 more projects under construction. \"We are moving from the bilateral power trade to a trilateral framework, opening avenues for sub-regional and regional cooperation in the energy sector,\" Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising said at a signing ceremony. The agreement was signed with the Bangladesh Power Development Board and India's NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, which will facilitate access to transmission lines. Under the agreement, Nepal will export 40 megawatts of electricity to Bangladesh from mid-June to mid-November over five years. A start date for transmission has not been specified yet. The electricity will be sold at 6.4 US cents per unit. Nepal would earn about $9.2 million a year, NEA spokesman Chandan Kumar Ghosh said. The power will first be transmitted to India's 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line, with the equivalent then sent on to Bangladesh. Landlocked Nepal first began exporting electricity to India on a smaller scale in late 2021. \"This marks a significant milestone as Nepal will, for the first time, export its hydropower to a third country,\" Nepal Energy Minister Deepak Khadka said. Some studies estimate water-rich Nepal could have a total potential capacity of 72,000 megawatts, more than 22 times the size of current installed capacity. Four in five Nepalis did not have access to electricity at the turn of the century, according to the International Energy Agency, but a dam-building spree has since helped connect nearly all its 30 million people to the grid.

    "text": "OLEKSII Tilnenko hoped this would be the year Ukraine drove Russian forces out of swathes of occupied land.\nAs 2023 draws to a close, his southern hometown of Kherson is still being pounded by shelling and the front line has barely budged.\nTilnenko, who fled Kherson last year and lives in Kyiv where he helps internally displaced people (IDPs), believes Russia is racing to rebuild its much larger armed forces to step up its war effort.\n“The hope is the West can somehow mobilise, somehow fire up its defence industry to renew equipment and produce what’s needed to defend our ordinary citizens,” said the 36-year-old.\nMore than 21 months into the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two, fighting rages with no end in sight and neither side has landed a telling blow on the battlefield.\nUkrainian soldiers, living in freezing trenches, acknowledge they are exhausted going into a second winter of full-scale war with a resource-rich, nuclear-armed superpower that has more than triple Ukraine’s population.\nUkrainians know they must secure Western military aid to carry on - and that it will be harder with the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza distracting global attention.\nUkrainian servicemen resting at their positions after a fight near the front line city of Bakhmut, in Donetsk, Ukraine. — Reuters\nRussian troops, who occupy about 17.5% of Ukraine, are again on the offensive in the east after largely withstanding a Ukrainian counteroffensive that was unable to punch through sprawling defensive lines in the south and east.\nThe darkening outlook contrasts starkly with Kyiv’s buoyant mood a year ago, after Ukrainians defied expectations by beating back Russian troops around their capital before recapturing territory in the northeast and south, including Kherson city.\nThe toll keeps mounting in a war that has already killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed Ukrainian cities, towns and villages, forced millions from their homes and placed hundreds of thousands more under occupation.\nDrone and missile strikes are a part of daily life.\nIn the northeastern city of Kharkiv, schools are being built underground so children can study in classrooms without dying in an air strike.\nTilnenko heads Crimea SOS, a group that helps Ukraine’s five million IDPs. He says he has no plans to return to Kherson because of the constant threat from artillery and guided aerial bombs.\nHe feels Western military aid should have come faster, in larger volumes and in a less piecemeal fashion.\nAir power vital for the counteroffensive, he says, was sorely lacking this year and promised F-16 fighter jets have not been delivered.\nThe passage of vital military and financial assistance from the West is no longer happening smoothly.\nUS President Joe Biden has made a Ukrainian victory a foreign policy goal as he campaigns for re-election in November 2024, but the fate of his proposed US$60bil aid package is uncertain because of opposition by some Republicans.\nA separate, four-year €20bil European Union military aid proposal has also run into resistance from some bloc members.\nThe lack of significant Ukrainian headway on the battlefield this year could also hurt Biden politically in an election in which could herald a comeback by former President Donald Trump, who called on Congress this summer to withhold aid to Ukraine.\nSome Ukrainians, including Tilnenko, believe Russian President Vladimir Putin will use any let-up in fighting to build further defences and regenerate the Russian army for a new assault.\nPutin may feel he can escalate Russia’s war effort further once, as expected, he has secured another six-year term in the Kremlin in an election next March.\nUkraine was also due to hold a presidential election in March, but this will not happen because of martial law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy put an end to speculation last month that a workaround would be found, saying now is “not the time” for an election.\nThe strain of the war is likely to weigh on society and the political landscape over the coming year. Reforms under way to make army recruitment and conscription more efficient illustrate the sensitive but important issues the government must navigate.\nTilnenko says war fatigue is a fact of life.\n“Everyone’s tired. The soldiers are tired, victims are tired, the IDPs are tired. But there’s no way out. We can’t just give up and say ‘okay, fine’. At the very least, too many people have died. We hope it’ll get easier. And we’ll see how it goes.” — Reuters\nOpen Modal ×",

Never missing out on an opportunity to inspire her audience through her social media posts, Chhavi recently shared a series of photos and penned a long note on self-love. hhavi Mittal has made a strong comeback from breast cancer. Never missing out on an opportunity to inspire her audience through her social media posts, Chhavi recently shared a series of photos and penned a long note on self-love. Taking to her Instagram handle, she posted a series of pictures from the gym and wrote a long note along with it. She mentioned, \"I've seen people run behind things and when they can't get them they get stressed. Then they run faster and in desperation till they burn themselves out. But little or no importance is given to self love. Why are people not running behind happiness and contentment and good health? \" Chhavi added, \"When somebody politely refuses an unhealthy snack s/he is mocked at but the enthusiastic eater is the life of a party. Little is spoken about a person succumbing to heart disease but so much brouhaha over somebody passing away in the gym. When was the last time you did something purely for your happiness or your health?\" The 'Ek Chutki Aasman' actor said that it is important for everyone not to think about \"judgements\" and what others are thinking rather focus on what makes you happy. \"Without thinking about judgements, minor setbacks at work, or your phone ringing? How many of you feel you don't have the \"time\"? I think, time is subjective to your priorities. If it's important, you'll make time. I know I'll never miss my gym or calisthenics time for a party. That's me prioritising myself, my happiness & my mental and physical health.I am unabashedly, unapologetically, in love with myself, \" she concluded. https://www.instagram.com/p/C5TClV7LaK4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== The actress has faced several serious health issues. She was diagnosed with costochondritis. Costochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone (sternum). Earlier, she wrote in her post, \"Naya wali beemari layi hoon market mein [I am here with a new disease]. It's called costochondritis. Fancy no? (It's an injury to a cartilage in the chest) The probable cause could be radiation (cancer treatment) or a side effect of the injection I took for osteopenia (a condition with low BMD) or it could be an incessant cough (which I had a few days back) or a combination of one or more or all.\" Chhavi revealed she has been experiencing \"pain while breathing, using my hand, or arm, or lying down, or sitting, or laughing or pretty much everything.\" She added, \"No, I'm not always positive about it, but I'm rarely negative. So, holding my chest in my hand, I went to the gym (my happiest place) because you know what? We all get knocked down, but do we get up again? Well, I do! For anyone who needs to hear this...I know ur suffering in some way or the other.. but ur not alone! And, this too shall pass.\" Concluding her post on a positive note, Chhavi wrote, \"For anyone who needs to hear this.. I know ur suffering in some way or the other.. but ur not alone! And THIS TOO SHALL PASS. #healthiswealth.\" In April 2022, Chhavi revealed that she was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. She underwent surgery and later declared herself cancer-free.
