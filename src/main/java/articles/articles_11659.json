    "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Residents living near the STX Beef Company on the Northwest Side are voicing their frustrations over a long-standing issue: the overpowering odor coming from the plant.\nMany have complained to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which has now imposed a hefty fine on the facility.\nNeighbors have battled with the smell for years, hoping that the fine will lead to lasting change.\nKRIS 6 News spoke with several people in the community who described the smell as unbearable and, in some cases, harmful to their health.\nOne neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, shared her frustration. She moved into the neighborhood five years ago and says the stench has been a constant issue ever since.\n“Ever since we’ve been here, we’ve had this smell coming from the plant,” she said.\nThe smell is not just unpleasant; it's impacting daily activities.\n“The smell is so strong sometimes that it’s unbearable. You can’t even run without feeling like your lungs are about to burst because you’re breathing in that thick smell,” she explained.\nShe added that it cuts her family's walks around the neighborhood short and her workouts.\nAnother neighbor across the street echoed similar frustrations, explaining how the stench prevented her from fully enjoying the home she worked so hard to build.\n“We’ve had gatherings in the front, and it’s embarrassing. People come over, and they’re like, ‘Oh, your house is so nice!’ But then they’re like, ‘Ew, what’s that smell?,'” another anonomys neighbor said.\nIt’s gotten so bad that even their pool, which was a major investment, is hardly used.\n“ We really don’t use it much. If the smell comes up, we just go inside,” she said.\nNeighbors also talked about the smell's impact on potential buyers, as a new subdivision is being built behind the STX Beef facility.\nThe ongoing complaints have resulted in action from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which issued a substantial fine to STX Beef after receiving multiple reports from local residents about the offensive odor.\nHowever, many neighbors are skeptical about whether the fine will result in any long-term improvements.\nResidents hope that the TCEQ's involvement will finally lead to a solution, whether that means stricter regulations on the plant or steps to address the root cause of the odor.",

    "text": "TAIPEI (TVBS News) — Taiwan's men's taekwondo team narrowly missed capturing gold at the World University Games in Germany, settling for silver after falling to South Korea on Thursday (July 24). The determined trio of Hung Jiun-yi (洪俊義), Chung Chun-chieh (鍾俊傑), and Huang Cho-cheng (黃卓乘) faced a formidable South Korean squad but ultimately succumbed 0-2 in the championship match. The hard-fought defeat marked another significant achievement for Taiwan's martial arts program on the international stage.\nTaiwan's men's team reached the championship match by systematically defeating Malaysia and Thailand before overcoming Uzbekistan with commanding scores of 28-11 and 10-8. South Korea's relentless offensive strategy proved decisive in the gold medal bout, overwhelming Taiwan with scores of 18-26 and 17-30. The silver medal represents Taiwan's second such achievement at the World University Games, matching their impressive 2017 performance when the island nation hosted the competition in Taipei.\nTaiwan's taekwondo delegation delivered exceptional performances across multiple disciplines throughout the international competition. The women's poomsae team captured Taiwan's first gold medal of the games, while their male counterparts secured bronze in the same technical forms category. Individual sparring competitions yielded remarkable results, with Huang Ying-hsuan (黃映瑄), Hung Jiun-yi, and Chin I-chun (金怡君) each claiming silver medals, while Chiu Yi-jui (邱義睿) earned bronze.\nThe women's team, featuring Chin I-chun, Chang Jui-en (張芮恩), and Lin Wei-chun (林唯均), opened their campaign with a convincing victory over Mexico. Thailand proved insurmountable in the quarterfinals, however, defeating Taiwan with narrow scores of 12-15 and 9-12 to end their semifinal aspirations. Taiwan's taekwondo athletes demonstrated remarkable resilience and technical skill throughout the competition, establishing a strong foundation for future international tournaments. ◼",

    "title": "Ultimate eCommerce Marketing Strategy in 15 Steps",
    "text": "Ultimate eCommerce Marketing Strategy in 15 Steps\nIn 2025, having a successful eCommerce business means more than owning an online store. It's also about learning how to connect, participate, and be efficient in a technology-dominated world.\nPeople have set greater demands than ever before. They expect tailored experiences, quick access, and immediate fulfilment. At the same time, businesses are always coming up with innovative strategies to capture the attention of a busy audience.\nTo distinguish out, companies must go beyond the fundamentals. They need to make a marketing plan that is as flexible and changing as the landscape.\nIt's not about doing what everyone else does or following general best practices. Being deliberate and data-driven is key to figuring out what works for your audience and making the most of every touchpoint to leave a lasting impact.\nA solid and well-thought-out plan may dramatically transform how your firm operates and thrives, from maximising video marketing to staying current with emerging technology such as virtual reality.\nThis guide's approaches are designed for folks who understand the complex market and are ready to improve their eCommerce marketing strategy for long-term success.\n1 – Dive Deep into Your Target Audience A strong eCommerce marketing strategy begins with a deep understanding of your target audience. Businesses typically fail because they assume a superficial approach to demographics will suffice.\nKnowing basic information such as age, gender, and location is beneficial but far from complete. To truly engage, go deeper into behavioural data, purchasing patterns, and your target group's challenges. What motivates their decisions? How do they like to interact with brands?\nThis is where developing detailed buyer personas comes into play. Analytic tools may be used to evaluate client journeys on your website, poll current customers, and analyse how your target audience uses social media.\nLook for trends in their preferences, spending behaviours, and even the gadgets they use. With this knowledge, you can create hyper-focused campaigns that seem less like marketing and more like a conversation.\nA well-defined audience guarantees that your marketing efforts are directed toward the right individuals with the right message, saving time and resources . Understanding your audience enhances targeting and is the cornerstone for all your playbook's techniques. With a well-defined target group, you can approach each campaign more accurately, resulting in better results.\n2 – Elevate Your eCommerce Game with Tailored Personalisation Personalisation is not a possibility in 2025. Customers want brands to respond to their requirements in real-time and customise each contact to their preferences. Generic marketing risks alienating your target group, whereas a tailored approach creates ties and increases loyalty. This applies to all channels, including a website experience, an email campaign, and even a targeted ad on social media.\nStart with segmentation. Divide your clients into categories based on their behaviour, hobbies, and purchase history. Then, they present information based on their specific interests. For example, if a consumer frequently purchases gym equipment, your next campaign may contain recommendations for similar goods or special prices in the same area.\nScalability is achieved by AI and machine learning-based personalisation strategies. Dynamic product suggestions, personalised email subject lines, and location-based marketing are all tactics for improving the user experience .\nWhen done effectively, customisation appears natural and intuitive rather than intrusive. It demonstrates to customers that you understand their demands, which increases their likelihood of engaging with and becoming loyal to your business. In a congested market, attention to detail might mean the difference between a customer choosing you or a competition.\n3 – High-Quality Content That Converts Content marketing is a crucial approach for eCommerce enterprises, and its importance in 2025 will only grow. High-quality content allows you to connect with your audience, build authority, and improve SEO performance, resulting in more organic traffic to your website. However, generating resonating content entails more than just writing blog posts or shooting videos; it demands a straightforward approach.\nBegin by defining the sorts of content that your target audience values. This might contain educational blog posts and how-to guides to attractive product videos or customer success stories. Content should solve a problem, answer a question, or motivate action. For example, a skincare company may publish a series of lessons on how to manage certain skin conditions using their products.\nQuality overcomes quantity. A few well-researched, intelligently made articles will trump dozens of generic entries. Repurposing material across many platforms, such as converting a blog post into an infographic or video instructional, broadens its reach and utility.\nGreat content fosters trust and a feeling of community surrounding your company. It draws visitors to your website and keeps them coming back. Content that genuinely adds value in a noisy digital environment sets your firm apart from its competitors.\n4 – Maximise Your Reach Through Strategic Social Media Advertising Campaigns Social media is a valuable tool for eCommerce businesses to target customers successfully. Platforms such as LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram provide options for precise audience segmentation depending on interest, behaviour, and demographics. This degree of targeting allows you to focus on contacting people more likely to interact with your brand and become consumers.\nSocial media advertising should be promotional, engaging, visually appealing, and tell a narrative. Carousel advertising with many products or shoppable posts that lead directly to your business is highly advantageous for eCommerce. Video advertising demonstrating how your product solves a problem or fits a particular lifestyle can improve engagement.\nRegularly analyse performance indicators like click-through rates , cost per acquisition, and conversion rates to ensure campaign success. Use A/B testing to fine-tune your messaging, images, and offerings. With regular improvement, social media advertising may be a reliable source of traffic and sales.\nSocial media platforms are more than just a tool to increase awareness; they also allow you to connect with your target audience on a deeper level. A well-executed campaign does more than sell; it leaves an impression and motivates consumers to stick with your brand over time.\n5 – Boost Visibility and Drive Conversions with SEO Strategies SEO techniques remain critical for any eCommerce business seeking to improve organic traffic. Customers typically utilise search engines like Google to begin their product searches. A great SEO plan ensures that your website ranks at the top of relevant search results, resulting in significant traffic from purchasers.\nStart with keyword research. Determine high-intent search terms relevant to your services, such as “best hiking backpacks” or “affordable skincare for sensitive skin”. Optimise product pages, meta descriptions, and headlines to include these keywords naturally. However, SEO is more than just employing keywords; technical SEO is also essential.\nTechnical SEO focuses on your website's backend. A fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and easy-to-navigate website improves the user experience while signalling quality to search engines. Ginger IT Solutions defines a successful SEO strategy as combining content optimisation with technology excellence to meet user and algorithmic expectations.\nSEO isn't a one-time activity. To stay competitive, update your content regularly, build backlinks from reputable sites, and assess results to improve future efforts. When done correctly, search engine optimisation (SEO) serves two purposes: it enhances exposure and attracts clients actively looking for your products or services.\n6 – Re-Engage Visitors By Utilising Retargeting Campaigns Retargeting campaigns are game changers for eCommerce companies looking to convert missed opportunities. Most visitors do not purchase their first visit to a website, but it does not mean they are uninterested. Retargeting advertising lets you stay on their radar by reminding them of what piqued their interest.\nTo retarget effectively, you must first understand user behaviour. If someone abandons a cart, offer them adverts featuring the identical things they left behind, maybe accompanied by a discount to encourage purchase. If a user explores a product category, show advertising for popular goods in that range.\nRetargeting campaigns may be easily implemented using platforms like Google Ads and Facebook Ads. Make sure your advertising is visually engaging and has clear calls to action. Timing is critical; approach visitors to capitalise on their interest shortly after their first visit. However, avoid overwhelming them with numerous advertisements since this might backfire.\nRetargeting initiatives don't simply increase sales; they also improve brand remember. Even if a consumer does not convert immediately, viewing your adverts keeps your brand on their mind for future purchases. This method bridges the gap between initial interest and final conversion, making it critical to eCommerce success.\n7 – Prioritise Seamless Mobile Experiences Mobile optimisation is no longer an option for eCommerce enterprises; it is a need. Given that most online consumers utilise mobile devices, offering a seamless mobile experience might significantly impact conversions and overall customer satisfaction. A poorly designed mobile site might irritate customers, leading to higher bounce rates and lost sales opportunities.\nMobile optimisation begins with responsive design. Your website should adjust automatically to fit any screen size, making it easy to navigate and read. Beyond design, fast loading times are crucial. Mobile users want pages to load quickly; delays may push them to competitors. Compress images, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and use caching tactics to improve performance.\nAnother key consideration is intuitive navigation. Simplify your menus, use more prominent, user-friendly buttons, and ensure a seamless checkout process. A multi-step, complicated checkout procedure kills conversions on mobile. Autofill forms and digital wallet solutions (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) help to speed up the procedure.\nDo not underestimate mobile SEO . Google promotes mobile-friendly websites, so optimising for mobile boosts your search ranks . By concentrating on mobile optimisation, you can provide an experience that fulfils client expectations while keeping your company competitive in an increasingly mobile-driven market.\n8 – Harness the Power of Engaging Video Content Video marketing is one of the most successful methods for engaging modern customers. It is lively, visually attractive, and delivers information quickly, making it suitable for eCommerce. Customers are more likely to purchase after seeing a product video, highlighting the importance of adding video content to your marketing strategy.\nBegin with product demonstrations. A video demonstrating a product in action can address potential consumers' questions and alleviate their concerns far more effectively than text alone. Tutorials, unboxing movies, and “how-to” tutorials are handy for increasing trust and confidence in your products.\nBehind-the-scenes content also works nicely. Showing your team at work or your product's path from inception to delivery humanises your company and allows you to connect with your target audience. Short-form videos on sites like Instagram Reels or TikTok capture people's attention immediately, while longer forms work well on YouTube.\nUse video adverts on platforms like Facebook or Google to broaden your audience. Include subtitles for accessibility, and ensure the movies are suitable for mobile viewing. Making video marketing a fundamental aspect of your plan boosts engagement, improves conversions, and differentiates your company in a competitive market.\n9 – Smart Email Marketing Automation Strategies Email marketing for eCommerce has always been a chance to turn a window shopper into a returning customer, and with automation, it can be on the next level of engagement. Sending well-prepared, timely emails based on consumer behaviour guarantees your messages are understood, increasing engagement and conversions. Instead of mass-produced communications, automated email marketing considers each customer's demands.\nBegin with a welcome series. When a person signs up, send emails introducing your company, highlighting popular goods, or giving a discount on their first purchase. Follow up with browse abandonment emails to remind visitors about goods they showed interest in but did not add to their basket.\nAbandoned cart emails are especially effective at recovering lost money. Include photos of the things left behind and a strong call to action or a limited-time offer. Post-purchase emails can be used to offer similar products or solicit comments, resulting in further engagement.\nAutomation solutions like Mailchimp and Klaviyo make setting up and tracking campaigns simple. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like open rates, click-through rates, and conversions to optimise your strategy. While it saves time, automated email marketing still provides relevant, personalised connections that keep consumers returning.\n10 – Create Irresistible Customer Loyalty Programs Customer loyalty programs are a familiar tactic for keeping existing customers and boosting their lifetime value. Loyal and returning customers are more profitable and serve as brand ambassadors for attracting new clientele through word of mouth and social proof. A well-designed loyalty program will motivate purchasers by rewarding their engagement and purchases, resulting in a repeat customer of your company.\nBegin by figuring out what inspires your audience. Potential strategies include point-based systems, exclusive pricing, first access to new products, and member-only advantages. Integrating these rewards into your eCommerce website and app lets customers easily track and redeem their benefits.\nPersonalisation is crucial. Personalise the experience by providing consumers with perks depending on their purchases or preferences. For example, if consumers often purchase skin care items, giving them a free sample of a new lotion may be more tempting than just offering them a discount.\nGamification should also be included in loyalty programs. Tiers, badges, and limited-time challenges encourage customers to engage more often. To keep the program front of mind, send out emails or in-app updates frequently.\nWhen done effectively, loyalty programs strengthen connections , enhance retention, and transform customers into brand ambassadors, allowing your firm to prosper in a competitive eCommerce market.\n11 – Build Trust with Authentic Influencer Collaborations Influencer collaborations are a practical approach to interacting with specific audiences and gaining confidence in your business. Influencers have built a reputation among their following, and their suggestions may greatly influence purchase decisions, particularly in the eCommerce industry. Partnering with the right influencers broadens your reach and helps your business connect with relevant audiences.\nChoose influencers whose ideas and content align with your brand. Authenticity is crucial; followers may sense when promotions look forced or disconnected. Micro-influencers with smaller but more engaged audiences typically yield more significant ROI than larger influencers since their recommendations are more tailored.\neCommerce campaigns may include product reviews, unboxings, or sponsored articles that showcase your products in real-world scenarios. Discount coupons and affiliate links make conversion monitoring easier and make the relationship more tangible for both parties.\nClosely monitor the campaign's performance. Metrics such as engagement rates, click-throughs, and sales conversions reveal which techniques work. Building long-term connections with influencers may transform one-time collaborations into recurring partnerships, encouraging continued interaction with their audience.\nInfluencer marketing is about more than simply reaching people; it's also about building trust and reputation in a way that directly supports eCommerce development.\n12 – Cutting-edge AI and Machine Learning Solutions Artificial intelligence and machine learning are altering how eCommerce organisations work, providing tools for improving consumer experiences and optimising internal procedures. AI-powered solutions, from tailored suggestions to chatbots, increase productivity and engagement at all touchpoints.\nAI excels at customisation. Machine learning algorithms monitor client behaviour and propose items based on individual tastes, boosting the possibility of conversion. This technology drives elements such as “customers also bought” and “recommended for you,” which have become commonplace on modern eCommerce sites.\nChatbots and virtual assistants are yet another game changer. They provide quick help, respond to client queries, and walk customers through the purchasing process without the need for human participation. Advanced chatbots can even tackle complex inquiries, which enhances the entire user experience.\nAI enhances inventory management on the backend by forecasting demand based on trends and historical data. This eliminates overstocking and stockouts, ensuring you are adequately prepared to meet customer requests.\nAI may assist marketers in analysing performance indicators and forecasting future trends, allowing them to fine-tune campaigns more precisely. Adopting AI and machine learning streamlines operations and gives your organisation a competitive advantage by delivering better, more responsive solutions.\n13 – Authentic Social Proof Across Your Brand Touchpoints Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that heavily influences purchasing decisions. When potential buyers realise that others trust and love your items, they become more confident in your brand. Showcasing social evidence in eCommerce might be the difference between a successful sale and an abandoned basket.\nBegin by prominently displaying consumer feedback and ratings on your product pages. A combination of detailed feedback and star ratings offers customers a comprehensive picture of what to expect. If your items have been highlighted in the media or promoted by influencers, acknowledge these achievements—trust badges, such as certificates or secure payment logos, and comfort customers about your reputation.\nUser-generated material is another excellent technique to increase trust. Encourage consumers to send images or videos of your items in use, which you can then showcase on your website or social media. Authentic information appeals to potential consumers more than slick marketing tactics .\nSocial proof isn't static. To keep your brand relevant, collect new reviews regularly, update testimonials , and engage with user-generated content. Integrating social proof throughout your touchpoints fosters trust and credibility, resulting in more conversions and stronger customer relationships.\n14 – Track, Analyse, and Optimise Your Performance Metrics Data is instrumental in eCommerce. Monitoring performance indicators allows you to make more informed decisions and consistently enhance your marketing efforts. Without monitoring, you're essentially flying blind in a market that demands precision and agility.\nConsider key performance metrics (KPIs) like conversion rates, average order value, and client acquisition expenses. Use Google Analytics or specialist eCommerce platforms to learn about user behaviour, sales trends, and campaign performance. Heatmaps may indicate how users browse your website, highlighting areas for improvement.\nDetermine which channels provide the most traffic and conversions. If one platform repeatedly underperforms, consider rethinking your approach or shifting resources to other productive channels. Regular monitoring analytics allows you to discover problems early, such as a sudden decline in traffic or high cart abandonment rates.\nUse this data to test and enhance your marketing strategies. A/B testing different ad creatives, product page layouts, and email subject lines can allow you to establish which are more effective with your target market. Metrics are more than just numbers; they provide the framework for making more intelligent, focused decisions that maximise ROI and keep your organisation competitive.\n15 – Adapt to Emerging Trends To Stay Ahead of the Competition The eCommerce sector is rapidly developing, and long-term success requires anticipating and adapting to future trends. Businesses that adapt quickly have a competitive edge, whilst those that linger risk becoming irrelevant. Several events are affecting the scene in 2025 and must be handled.\nVoice search is becoming more popular as smart speakers and voice assistants integrate into daily life. You may target this population by optimising your website for voice search queries. Concentrate on conversational keywords and ensure your material properly answers frequently asked questions.\nAugmented reality (AR) is another innovation altering the online shopping experience . Customers can use augmented reality technology to perceive objects in their environment, such as wearing virtual clothing or determining how furniture fits in their space. Investing in augmented reality technology can increase consumer confidence while lowering returns.\nSustainability is increasingly becoming an important consideration for customers. To attract this rising generation, highlight eco-friendly initiatives such as recyclable packaging and ethical sourcing. Experimenting with new platforms or technologies, such as social commerce features or blockchain for secure transactions, can help to future-proof your firm.\nBy being proactive and embracing these trends, you can keep your eCommerce strategy fresh, imaginative, and prepared for tomorrow's challenges.\nConclusion eCommerce success in 2025 needs intentionality, agility, and a complete understanding of your customer and the evolving market. Set-it-and-forget-it tactics are obsolete. Businesses that don't change risk becoming obsolete since what worked last year may not work now. These tactics allow firms to stay competitive and inventive and meet customer expectations.\nThough sales and conversion rates are essential, this is about more. It's about creating a brand people trust , remember, and actively pick from many options. Create experiences that keep people coming back—not just for what you offer, but for how you make them feel every time.\nYour firm may survive by refining and watching trends in the fast-paced, ever-changing eCommerce world. You can develop and succeed—you need to take it.",

    "text": "The Salvation Army in Wheeling is looking to battle the cold by opening its shelter during the day to keep people warm. \"We're already talking about a class of people that are not in good health to begin with, so when something like this happens, it can be deadly, literally,\" said Lt. John Lawrence, corps officer, Salvation Army. The shelter will remain open during the day while the temperature is below freezing. The Salvation Army also partnered with Wheeling Subaru and Operation Warm for a children's shoe drive so they can stay warm and involved this winter. \"The shoe is that extra step,” Lawrence said. “I don't know about you, but when I was a kid and I got a new pair of shoes, you got excited going to school in your new shoes.\" Operation Warm and Wheeling Subaru donated 120 athletic shoes for children to use throughout the year. Anyone looking to register for size and pickup can call the Salvation Army (304-233-4400) and a pickup date will be given. \"It puts a smile on a kid’s face,” Lawrence said. “And so often kids’ feet are not taken care of throughout the year. Giving them a quality pair of shoes will not only put that smile on their face. But also help them take care of their health as well as participation in activities with other children.\" The Salvation Army is still accepting applications for Operation Warm.",
