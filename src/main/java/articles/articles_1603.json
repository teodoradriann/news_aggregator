    "title": "Hajj Pilgrimage From BD To KSA Running Smoothly : HAAB President",
    "text": "Dhaka : A total of 85,000 pilgrims including guides from Bangladesh are currently travelling to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in phases, to perform the holy hajj pilgrimage this year. Under the initiative Road to Mecca, the Saudi Arabia's arrival immigration of the pilgrims takes place at Dhaka Airport. Hence, after arriving in Saudi, pilgrims directly go to their respective hotels where their luggage await. Thanks to this initiative, hajj pilgrimage from Bangladesh to Saudi is running quite smoothly and efficiently. M Shahadat Hossain Taslim, President of Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, said this while talking to The Bangladesh Monitor at his office in the capital recently. He informed, HAAB played an important role in the implementation of the Road to Mecca initiative in Bangladesh. Furthermore, another positive reformation that took place in the hajj management system this year was the addition of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in pilgrims' luggage which prevents it from getting lost. Also, this year, the pilgrims across 64 districts of the country have been provided with a new module of hajj training by HAAB and the Religious Affairs Ministry . Besides, HAAB constantly monitors all the 259 lead agencies involved in this year's hajj pilgrimage from Bangladesh. However, the association's President stressed that the middlemen syndicate still remains. \"We, together with the Religious Affairs Ministry and Home Ministry, are in efforts to mitigate it,\" claimed the HAAB President. Apart from this, the government of Saudi Arabia has brought many other changes to the hajj management system this year. All the processes have gone online. This move has simplified the hajj management process, added Taslim. However, sometimes there lies an issue with online systems-not getting instant solutions if any problem arises, mentioned Taslim. Also, transferring hajj expenses of pilgrims has been difficult this year after the process was made central, informed the HAAB President. According to him, it now takes more time compared to before. Another problem this year turned out to be getting monazzem visas. Hajj agencies require this visa to visit Saudi for booking hotels and houses for the pilgrims prior to their arrival. From this year, Saudi authorities stopped the monazzem visa for hajj agencies. Hence, many hajj agencies found it difficult to rent houses in Saudi Arabia to accommodate pilgrims prior to hajj. They had to find alternative ways-by applying for other visas-to visit Saudi for this purpose. About the high airfare of hajj flights, Taslim urged the government to form a technical committee with aviation and travel experts, which will work to set a reasonable airfare that benefits both parties-hajj pilgrims as well as flight service providers. He further suggested the gov to reduce the minimum quota of pilgrims that each hajj agency can manage to ensure better service quality to the pilgrims which is any agency's biggest priority. At present, the minimum number is 250 while the maximum quota is 500 for each agency. The HAAB President attributed the year-on-year increasing hajj cost to the dollar crisis. Still, HAAB managed to reduce the cost of each hajj package by BDT 90,000 this year, expressed the President.

    "title": "Israel Hit Iran's Nuclear Program in October: Axios Confirms Earlier Report",
    "text": "Axios reported Friday that Israel did, in fact, hit Iranian nuclear facilities in its response last month to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, confirming reporting by Breitbart News based on a theory first floated by Israeli columnist Caroline Glick.\nAs Breitbart News reported in October:\n[Glick] noted that Israel hit Parchin, a secret Iranian military base that has long been a suspected site for Iran’s nuclear program.\nMedia reports suggest that the target at Parchin was “a building that was part of Iran’s defunct nuclear weapons development program, and … facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles.” But the program is likely not “defunct,” and Parchin was also allegedly an “ undeclared ” nuclear site, meaning that the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] was not monitoring it closely.\n…\nJust as it defied the U.S. in targeting Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon, and in killing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, Glick suggests, Israel may have gone beyond the restrictions imposed by the Biden-Harris administration and used its retaliatory strike against Iran to accomplish broader strategic goals.\nAxios.com’s Barak Ravid reported a “scoop” on Friday:\nThe Israeli attack on Iran in late October destroyed an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, according to three U.S. officials, one current Israeli official and one former Israeli official.\nWhy it matters: The strike — which targeted a site previously reported to be inactive — significantly damaged Iran’s effort over the past year to resume nuclear weapons research, Israeli and U.S. officials said.\nOne former Israeli official briefed on the strike said it destroyed sophisticated equipment used to design the plastic explosives that surround uranium in a nuclear device and are needed to detonate it.\nPresident-elect Trump said earlier in October that Israel should destroy Iran’s nuclear program in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, the single largest such attack in human history. Roughly 85% of the missiles were intercepted.\nTrump has since said that he wants to reach an agreement with Iran to avoid further war — which may be feasible, especially if Iran’s nuclear program has been damaged, along with its air defenses and its ballistic missile program.\nJoel B.

    "title": "Florida Sues DOJ for Obstructing State Investigation into 2nd Trump Assassination Attempt",
    "text": "( Headline USA ) Florida sued the Biden administration’s [Justice Department](/tag/justice-department) this week for allegedly blocking the state’s investigation into the second assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said the DOJ has “frustrated” the state’s efforts to get to the bottom of the [assassination](/tag/assassination) attempt “at every turn.” The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in federal court, accuses the DOJ of preventing Florida officials from interviewing witnesses, pursuing state-level charges against the attempted assassin, [Ryan Routh](/tag/Ryan-routh), and conducting their own parallel probe. The DOJ may be withholding massive amounts of evidence. According to a recent federal court filing, investigators have amassed some 10 terabytes of evidence in Routh’s case. The DOJ disclosed yesterday that they have some 10 TERABYTES of data in the 2nd Trump assassination case. They seek a protective order to prevent Ryan Routh from giving that info to the media. Apparently, he's been trying to speak to media from behind bars — further supporting…[pic.twitter.com/0p6PUqHLKn]— Ken Silva (@JD_Cashless) [October 17, 2024] “Every day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the State’s case becomes harder to prove at trial,” documents read. The assassination attempt took place at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course in September. [Secret Service](/tag/secret-service) agents opened fire on Routh, who had been hiding in shrubbery near the course. He was later apprehended and is facing multiple federal charges. “The attempted assassination on the former president is a heinous act,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. “I am grateful that he is safe, and as I said immediately after the event, the Justice Department will spare no resource to ensure accountability.” However, Moody said the DOJ has been deliberately withholding resources from Florida. 🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨 FL v DOJ [pic.twitter.com/bo77SIES0c]— AG Ashley Moody (@AGAshleyMoody) [October 24, 2024] “Governor [Ron] DeSantis was very clear he wanted Florida to move forward with an independent investigation of state crimes, working with the federal government, of course. But he felt that was in the best interest of the state, our sovereignty, and for the American people, as there are concerns that the same federal agencies investigating the assassination attempt are the ones that are seeking to go after and prosecute the president, the victim in this case,” Moody told Fox News. Instead of working with Florida, the Justice Department has gone so far as to threaten “suspending state jurisdiction, which would indefinitely put our investigation on hold,” she explained. “We don’t believe the law supports that.”",
