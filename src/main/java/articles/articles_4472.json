    "text": "Western University of Health Sciences has appointed Gail Evans Grayson, EdD, MA, as Dean of the College of Health Sciences (CHS).\nPOMONA, Calif., April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Following a rigorous national search, Western University of Health Sciences has appointed Gail Evans Grayson, EdD, MA, as Dean of the College of Health Sciences (CHS), effective April 14, 2025.\nDr. Evans Grayson brings more than 25 years of progressive leadership in academic administration, program development, accreditation, faculty affairs, and interprofessional collaboration—core competencies essential to health sciences education in today's dynamic landscape. Her deep-rooted expertise in behavioral health and interdisciplinary care aligns with the evolving needs of the health care system and uniquely positions her to lead CHS into its next era of innovation, expansion, and impact.\nSince assuming the role of Acting Dean of CHS in November 2022, Dr. Evans Grayson has delivered a bold and strategic agenda. She successfully navigated the Physician Assistant Program through multiple, high-stakes accreditation processes — outcomes that not only reaffirm the program's academic rigor but also elevate the College's reputation nationally. Under her leadership, CHS has completed and implemented a comprehensive Strategic and Academic Plan, submitted a new Master of Health Administration (MHA) program for review, and oversaw major renovations including state-of-the-art upgrades to physical therapy labs and classrooms. Her focus on student success and alumni engagement is evident through initiatives such as the CHS Alumni Tutoring Program, which connects graduates with current students for mentoring and academic support.\nIn her previous roles as Executive Vice Dean, Interim Department Chair for Medical Sciences, and Chair of the Department of Health Sciences, Dr. Evans Grayson demonstrated an unwavering commitment to advancing academic excellence, equity, and innovation. She has championed faculty development, supported research capacity-building, and guided numerous accreditation and curricular initiatives across CHS programs. Her visionary approach emphasizes inclusive excellence and community-engaged scholarship, fostering a culture of collaboration across health disciplines.\nHer leadership reaches beyond WesternU. Dr. Evans Grayson was a member of the California Board of Behavioral Sciences and is an active contributor to national conversations on health equity and academic innovation through her roles with the American Public Health Association, the American Public Human Services Association, and several professional organizations including the American Conference of Academic Deans (ACAD), the Association of Schools Advancing Health Professions (ASAHP), the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education (NADOHE), and the National Association of Medical Minority Educators (NAMME).\nA strong advocate for pathway programs, she currently serves as Principal Investigator for the Summer Health Professions Education Program (SHPEP) at WesternU, which recently received $810,000 in funding. This investment supports undergraduate students in their pursuit of graduate health careers and exemplifies Dr. Evans Grayson's commitment to cultivating future leaders in health care through education, mentorship, and opportunity.\nDr. Evans Grayson's career began in direct clinical care, where she served as a medical and psychiatric social worker and later as a social services manager. These frontline experiences continue to shape her student-centered, equity-driven, and collaborative leadership style. Her work is informed by an enduring belief in the power of interdisciplinary education to improve lives, reduce health disparities, and transform communities.\nAs Dean, Dr. Evans Grayson will oversee CHS programs in California, including Health Sciences, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapy, and Medical Sciences. Her top priorities include faculty recruitment and retention, enrollment growth, enhanced clinical partnerships, and establishing new centers of excellence in research and innovation.\n\"The College of Health Sciences is well-positioned to build on its success through interprofessional education, program innovation, and community partnership,\" said WesternU Provost and Chief Academic Officer Paula M. Crone, DO '92. \"We are excited about what lies ahead and confident that Dr. Evans Grayson's leadership will continue to elevate CHS and WesternU as a whole.\"\nAs the College enters this pivotal chapter, Dr. Evans Grayson remains focused on shaping an academic ecosystem that is student-focused, faculty and staff-supported, community-engaged, and future-ready.\nMedia Contact\nRodney Tanaka, Western University of Health Sciences, 909-469-5402, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f2f4e1eee1ebe1c0f7e5f3f4e5f2eef5aee5e4f5), www.westernu.edu\nSOURCE Western University of Health Sciences",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "Squid Game : Saison 2 - Cinégoût",
    "text": "La première saison de “Squid Game” a pris d’assaut le monde et reste aujourd’hui encore l’une des choses les plus regardées jamais vues sur Netflix, séries et films compris. Ce n’était donc qu’une question de temps avant que la saison 2 ne devienne officielle, mais la question était toujours de savoir si elle serait bonne.\nLe créateur lui-même a déclaré qu’il travaillait sur la première saison depuis plusieurs années et qu’elle était déjà en développement en 2009, mais tout le monde l’a nié. Alors quand ils ont mis autant de temps pour que la première saison voie le jour, on a un peu peur que la saison 2, qui arrive seulement trois ans plus tard, soit précipitée et que Netflix ait trop déconné.\nHeureusement, ce ne sera pas le cas. Je pense que la saison 2 est au moins aussi excitante et divertissante que la première saison et à la hauteur. On a l’impression que le créateur lui-même a pu garder sa vision et a eu beaucoup de liberté avec cette saison.\nMême s’il y a un personnage qui semble typique d’Hollywood 2024 (vous saurez lequel c’est en le voyant). Mais honnêtement, ce personnage est quand même bien écrit et traité avec soin et n’est pas “en face” avec son agenda ou ce qu’il devrait être ainsi PK. Honnêtement, cela devient presque juste un élément de fond qui n’est pas pertinent dans le grand schéma des choses. Le personnage est devenu presque mon préféré parmi tous les nouveaux introduits.\nEt je pense que cette saison fait mieux que la dernière.\nNous avons plus de temps pour connaître les personnages cette saison, tant à l’intérieur des jeux qu’à l’extérieur. Nous apprenons également à mieux connaître les personnes derrière les masques, donc il ne s’agit pas seulement des joueurs.\nMême les nouveaux jeux sont plutôt amusants et innovants. J’ai adoré le jeu n°3 pour son chaos à chaque tour.\nBien sûr, il y a des répétitions et des choses qui sont copiées de la première saison. Mais c’est toujours divertissant et excitant de bout en bout, même quand c’est le cas, donc je n’ai pas de problème majeur avec ça.\nIl y a une intrigue secondaire qui est un peu éclipsée une fois les jeux lancés, qui, je l’espère, aura plus de place dans la saison 3, ce que je pense aussi.\nIl y a aussi une tournure impliquant un personnage que j’ai découvert dans l’épisode 2, donc cela ne m’a pas vraiment choqué lorsque cette tournure est sortie.\nCependant, il y avait une autre scène où j’étais sûr de ce qui allait se passer et de ce qu’un personnage allait faire. Mais ensuite, il s’est avéré que le personnage ne faisait pas ça du tout, et là, la série m’a pris en flagrant délit.\nIl est important cependant qu’il s’agisse davantage d’une saison 2, partie 1, car elle se termine sur un cliffhanger et la saison 3 a été filmée en même temps, il s’agit donc davantage de la stratégie classique de Netflix consistant à diviser les saisons. C’est peut-être le plus gros inconvénient dans son ensemble, que cette saison n’a pas de fin mais ressemble exactement au film intermédiaire d’une trilogie.\nDans l’ensemble, je pense que cette saison est tout aussi excitante et divertissante que la première et j’aime ce que le créateur Hwang Dong-hyuk nous a concocté. C’est brutal tout en étant divertissant. Quelque chose que la Corée du Sud maîtrise parfaitement.",
