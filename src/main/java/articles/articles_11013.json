    "text": "Former Attorney General Bill Barr has come out swinging against Donald Trump’s sham criminal trial and conviction, describing the entire process as an “abomination.” Barr made the comments during an interview on Fox News with Martha McCallum, pointing out that Trump obviously did not commit a crime. “I said from the very start that this was an abomination, and I actually was surprised that they went ahead with the case because there really was nothing there,” Barr said. “There was no crime there, and they really weren’t able to articulate it until after the defense rested its case. So I thought the whole thing was a travesty.” — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 5, 2024 The 74-year-old, who betrayed tens of millions of Americans by refusing to investigate election fraud during the 2020 presidential election, added that the conviction would undermine any potential Biden victory. “This will be eventually overruled after the election. But what if there’s a close election? And Biden squeaks through, and then the case is overruled?” he continued. “Half the country is gonna feel this was a stolen election and again, this is a grave injustice and disservice to the country.” Barr recently confirmed that despite their fallout and Trump’s various attacks on his character, he would still be voting for the former president in November. “If faced with a choice between two people, neither of which I think should be president, I feel it’s my duty to pick the person who I think would do the least damage to the country,” Barr said at the time. “And I think Trump would do less damage than Biden. And I think all this stuff about a threat to democracy, I think the real threat to democracy is the progressive movement. And in the Biden administration.”",

    "text": "2024-09-12 20:55:00\nThe news is not good for employees at branches of Samsung around the world. After the announcement of the 10% cut in India’s workforce a Reuters report showed that the South Korean company plans to fire more employees in subsidiaries in different locations such as:\nAmerica Europa Asia Africa Overall, the company is expected to lay off up to 15 percent of its marketing staff at its branches, while its administrative staff is expected to be reduced by up to 30 percent. The cuts are expected to be made by the end of this year, but it appears the company is unlikely to make such a move in its home country of South Korea.\nAccording to reports, the “global mandate” for the layoffs was issued three weeks ago. Samsung, for its part, went so far as to say that these changes are aimed at improving efficiency and classified them as “routine.” The production team, for its part, is not expected to undergo any staff cuts.\nRecent reports suggest that the South Korean company is going through a tough phase due to declining consumer demand. The company’s workforce reduction efforts may be related to this, as well as increased competition in the smartphone space and the recovery of the company’s chip business from a sharp slowdown.\n1726193329\n#Layoffs #sight #Samsung #cut #employees #divisions #world\n**PAA Related Questions for the ​Title: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts** Table of Contents\n1 **PAA Related Questions for the ​Title: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts** 2 Here are some People Also Ask (PAA) questions related to the title “Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts”: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of ⁣Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring⁣ Efforts\nIn‍ a move that⁢ is sending shockwaves across the globe, Samsung Electronics has announced plans to cut jobs by‌ up to 30% in some divisions, affecting sales, marketing,⁣ and administrative staff across various regions, including America, Europe, Asia, ⁤and Africa [[1]][[2]].

When the temperature or heat index in the District is forecasted to be 95 degrees or higher, the District Government implements the Heat Emergency Plan and activates cooling centers for community members to seek relief from the heat. A list of District cooling center locations is available at [heat.dc.gov](http://heat.dc.gov/). Extreme heat is dangerous and can cause illnesses and death. As temperatures rise, you are encouraged to take an active role in your safety and take action to stay cool. - Stay indoors: Find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat. - Check on your neighbors: Young children, the elderly, and those with disabilities or other access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in our community. If you or someone you know needs free, accessible transportation to a cooling center, please call the shelter hotline at 202-399-7093 or dial 311. - Drink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing.
