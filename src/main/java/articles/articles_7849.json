    "text": "Llevamos unos cuantos años declarando la muerte en vida de las redes sociales. Facebook es un cadáver andante , solo lo usan 3.000 millones de «viejos» en todo el mundo. Twitter era una ruina que ya no influía nada antes de que la comprara Elon Musk por 40.000 millones. Ahora, devaluada, transmutada en X y repleta de discursos de odio, sigue moviendo el mundo (lo acabamos de ver con la elección de Trump). A YouTube le quedaban dos telediario s desde la irrupción de TikTok , pero es el principal distribuidor de música del mundo y en España es la tercera plataforma más utilizada para ver «televisión conectada», por delante de Disney o Movistar . Y ha sido decisiva para las recientes elecciones en Estados Unidos. Podíamos citar también a Snapchat, Pinterest o BeReal , dadas por amortizadas y que ahí siguen, con millones de usuarios activos. Su cotización varía según su desempeño en la guerra por vampirizar nuestra atención. Pueden declinar o ser despreciadas, pero que se extingan o cesen su actividad es una anomalía histórica.\nTambién es poco frecuente una estampida como la que se ha producido de la polémica X hacia la emergente Bluesky . Se habló de un éxodo de millones de usuarios, pero en realidad muchos usan y usarán las dos plataformas. Las redes se parecen a las cucarachas: sobreviven, persisten y vuelven.",

    "title": "ODOT gets $10 million federal grant to repair, upgrade public EV charging stations around state",
    "text": "SALEM, Ore. (KTVZ) -- Electric vehicle drivers throughout Oregon will have a more reliable public charging experience over the next few years, thanks to a federal grant program sending $10 million to Oregon for public EV charger repairs and station upgrades. The $10 million grant will repair broken EV charging ports at public EV charging stations throughout the state. The funding can also be used to install more Level 2 or DC fast charging ports at project sites. The ODOT Climate Office will oversee the grant fund distribution in Oregon, according to the agency's news release, which continues in full below: Given this is a new federal grant program, we’re still working on the best, most efficient way to distribute the funds and how to engage the private sector. The charging stations are owned by private companies, so we’ll work with them to repair broken charging ports and upgrade stations. Per federal rules, private companies are required to contribute 20% matching funds in order to receive grant funding. We expect charging port repair and station upgrade projects to start by the end of 2024. We’ll update you on the timeline later this year via email. The grant comes from the federal Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program . It’s part of the $5 billion investment in public EV charging nationwide from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and overseen by the Federal Highway Administration. ODOT was among 24 grant recipients in 20 states, and one of the 14 state DOTs to receive funding. The Federal Highway Administration has identified 135 public EV charging stations in Oregon that have at least one broken EV charging port — either Level 2 or DC fast chargers — that are eligible for repairs or upgrades using grant funds. We created an online map of those public EV charging stations identified by the FHWA: view the map on Google Maps. Note: This map is not the final list of charging stations that will receive funds for repairs or upgrades. It’s the pool of potential sites from which the final sites will be selected. We do not have details yet on the final list of stations, but we’re working on that process now, and we’ll share more information with you later this year via email. Sign up for email updates about our EV charging infrastructure work . Here’s more specifics on the potential work to be covered by these funds. These are estimates because private-sector participation and project costs will vary. As of January 2024, there are about 2,900 public EV charging ports in Oregon (Level 2 and DC fast chargers) among 1,160 stations. There are roughly 80,000 registered EVs in Oregon, as of the latest data from September 2023. EV charger reliability is critical to speed EV growth and foster confidence among EV drivers throughout Oregon. If more people can imagine an EV fitting into their daily lives, then they may consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase. Spurring the transition to EVs is one of the ways we’re working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Oregon. By 2050, our data says we’re on track to reduce emissions by about 60% below 1990 levels. Learn how we’ll get there on Oregon’s transportation emissions website .

    "title": "Alumni Spotlight: Howard Reich | Northwestern Bienen School of Music",
    "text": "Howard Reich ‘77 is an Emmy Award-winning author, journalist, and filmmaker. He has written six books: The Art of Inventing Hope: Intimate Conversations with Elie Wiesel, Prisoner of Her Past: A Son’s Memoir, Jelly’s Blues: The Life, Music and Redemption of Jelly Roll Morton (with William Gaines), Van Cliburn, Portraits in Jazz, and Let Freedom Swing. He is also writer-producer of three documentary films: For the Left Hand, Prisoner of Her Past and Kenwood’s Journey. Reich served on the jury for the Pulitzer Prize in Music four times, including the first time a jazz composition won, Wynton Marsalis’ Blood on the Fields (1997). He covered music for the Chicago Tribune from 1978-2021; holds two honorary doctorate degrees; received Northwestern’s Alumni Merit Award in 2007; and gave the Bienen School’s [convocation address](https://music.northwestern.edu/davee-gallery/video/2019-convocation-address-howard-reich) in 2019. He currently is touring the country with his film For the Left Hand, which has been broadcast nationally on PBS and now is screening around the world. He also is working with colleagues at Bravo Niagara! Festival of the Arts on creating Kimiko’s Pearl, an evening-length ballet about Japanese-Canadian internment, with a scenario written by Reich; a world premiere is planned for spring of 2024. Why did you choose the Bienen School of Music? In fact, I applied and was accepted to the Medill School of Journalism. However, a few weeks before my freshman year began, I realized I could no longer resist my desire and need to study music. So, I auditioned as a piano major for Professor Donald Isaak and was immediately accepted into Bienen. I cannot overstate the importance of my studies at Bienen to the entirety of my career; this is where I encountered mountains of repertoire then unfamiliar to me, learned to analyze works of music note-for-note, and came to appreciate more deeply than ever the potential value of a life spent in music and the arts. Which professors influenced you the most during your time at the Bienen School of Music? Two stand out. Wanda Paul, a brilliant and groundbreaking concert pianist in her own right, imbued me with musical values I treasure to this day. Thomas Willis, then the Chicago Tribune’s music critic, similarly shaped the values I try to follow in my own writing. In addition, I feel lucky to have studied contemporary repertoire with composer Alan Stout, ear training with musicologist Arrand Parsons, and music theory with composer M. William Karlins. Tell us about a particular experience that impacted you during your time at the Bienen School of Music. Once a year, during our weekly piano solo class in Lutkin Hall, we’d hear a performance by the eminent American pianist Ralph Votapek ’60, a Bienen alum and first winner of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 1962. Never before had I heard a pianist of this world-class caliber in such an intimate setting. I was so moved by these performances that when I became a Chicago Tribune music critic, I wrote about Votapek at every opportunity. What lesson did you learn at Bienen that has continued to resonate with you in your career? Wanda Paul, my piano professor, insisted that we music students not lock ourselves in our practice rooms but get out to attend as many concerts as possible. She also told us to go to museums, read books, and attend film screenings – immerse ourselves in the arts, in other words. Ms. Paul believed that those experiences would make you a better musician and a better human being. I took that lesson to heart, devoting my career as a critic to devotedly attending performances and other arts events. Describe one of your career highlights. In 2012, the Chicago Tribune asked me to interview Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who would be receiving the newspaper’s Literary Award. I presumed I was picked for this assignment because I’m the son of two Holocaust survivors and have written extensively on this subject. To my utter surprise, however, what started out as a Tribune interview quickly evolved into a close personal friendship with Professor Wiesel, stretching the last four years of his life. I documented what I learned from this great man and singular writer/philosopher – and his final thoughts on the Holocaust – in my book The Art of Inventing Hope: Intimate Conversations with Elie Wiesel. What music have you been listening to lately? I listen to music constantly, except when I’m writing, at which time I need silence. Above all, I savor Arthur Rubinstein’s pianism, Frank Sinatra’s and Ella Fitzgerald’s vocals, and every note written by Maurice Ravel, whom I consider a genius among geniuses.",

The 94 Muslim registrars who were employed under the revoked Act will also be released from their positions and given a lump sum payment of Rs 2 lakh,\" he told reporters.\nMallabarua also emphasised the decision's wider ramifications, especially in light of the state's efforts to prohibit child marriage. He pointed out that juvenile marriages had been made easier by the antiquated 1935 Act, which was a holdover from the British Empire.\n\"The administration intends to address the issue of child marriage, which is defined as the union of individuals under the ages of 18 for women and 21 for men, by repealing this Act,\" the minister added.\nPublished: 24 Feb 2024, 9:44 AM",

    "text": "Officials with the University of South Carolina (USC) are meeting Thursday afternoon to make an announcement regarding the school’s athletic department. By Kevin Connaughton and Joshua Hemphill Published: Dec. 5, 2024 at 8:14 AM EST | Updated: 18 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - The University of South Carolina named Jeremiah Donati as its 31st Director of Athletics, President Michael Amiridis announced Thursday afternoon following a meeting of the school’s Board of Trustees.\nThe decision comes months after former AD Ray Tanner stepped down to transition into a new role with the school.\n“I’m honored to join the University of South Carolina, a school with a rich history of athletic excellence and passionate fans,” said Donati. “I look forward to working alongside our exceptional coaches, student-athletes, and staff to continue building on the tremendous success of Gamecock Athletics. Our goal is to be a national leader in both competitive excellence and student-athlete experience. We will compete for championships while ensuring our student-athletes are supported in all aspects of their college careers.”\nDonati became TCU’s Director of Intercollegiate Athletics in 2017 after he arrived at TCU in 2011.\nHe was previously the Horned Frogs’ Deputy Athletics Director before becoming TCU’s eighth Director of Intercollegiate Athletics.\nAccording to Donati’s TCU profile, he played a major role in enhancing the TCU student-athlete experience through donor-supported facility upgrades totaling nearly $500 million.\nThe department’s most recent project, a $50 million renovation and expansion of the Athletics Human Performance Center, was announced in December 2022.\nIn the 2023-24 athletics season, TCU was one of only five schools nationally to win multiple NCAA Championships. In the previous 2022-23 season, TCU became the first school in the College Football Playoff era to reach the CFP, NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, and College World Series in the same academic year.\nUnder first-year head football coach Sonny Dykes, the Horned Frogs reached the College Football Playoff in 2022, defeating Michigan in the CFP semifinals of the Fiesta Bowl and playing Georgia in the national championship game.\n“I am thrilled to welcome Jeremiah Donati to Gamecock Nation,” said USC President Michael Amiridis. “Jeremiah’s accomplishments at TCU speak for themselves. His leadership will be invaluable as we continue to build on the successes of Gamecock Athletics and ensure that our student-athletes have the support and resources they need to compete at the highest level.”\nFeel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.
