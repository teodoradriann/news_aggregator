    "text": "Donald Wildmon, the founder of the American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has died, the organization announced Thursday. The 85-year-old Mississippi native died on Thursday from complications related to Lewy body dementia, an obituary published by WTVA-TV said. Wildmon died in Tupelo, Mississippi, the city where the American Family Association is based. The obituary referred to Wildmon as “one of the legendary leaders of American conservatism.” “His impressive legacy of Christian ministry will live on for many years to come,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves , a Republican , said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Wildmon founded the AFA, first known as the National Federation for Decency, in 1977 after working as a pastor for the United Methodist Church. Since its inception, the conservative advocacy group has launched campaigns and boycotts to pressure corporations to avoid supporting causes the group opposed, such as LGBT anti-discrimination measures. In 1991, Wildmon launched American Family Radio, which set up radio stations across the U.S. to spread the AFA's message. Wildmon led the AFA for 33 years, the obituary said. He stepped down in 2010, and his son, Tim Wildmon, now leads the organization.",

    "text": "Nagpur: A 23-year-old construction worker, who suffered a major accident at workplace on December 26, was saved thanks to the quick action by his co-workers and skilled medical intervention by doctors.Sumit Kumar not only survived the accident, but is now capable of walking again after full recovery.106363785 A metal rod had pierced Sumit Kumar’s leg during the fall, leaving him unconscious and bleeding profusely. “Time was our biggest enemy,” recalls Dr Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, where Sumit was rushed after the accident. “X-ray showed shattered bones, severed arteries, and a leg turning blue from compromised blood flow,” he said.Dr Dande and a team of specialists got into the action mode. Orthopedic surgeon Dr Siddharth Jagtap meticulously removed the rod, while plastic surgeon Dr Parikshit Janai worked to salvage muscle and skin. Anesthetist Dr Girish Thakre kept Sumit under watch and critical care intensivist Dr Sushant Mule prepared for potential complications. Radiologist Amol Gawale’s expertise proved invaluable in navigating through the delicate surgery.“The rod had damaged vital structures, and the leg was on the verge of necrosis. Thankfully, our coordinated effort paid off,” said Dr Dande. Sumit underwent a successful surgery, and while the road to recovery is long, his leg has been saved.This incident, Dr Dande points out, highlights the crucial role of timely first aid. Praising Sumit’s co-workers, Dr Dande said, “The co-workers were unable to remove the rod but made sure they prevented further injury. They brought an electric cutter and separated him from the injury spot. Sumit was stabilized and then brought to the hospital. All these steps were very crucial,” Dr Dande said.Besides, collaboration between doctors from different specialties ensured every aspect of Sumit’s condition was addressed. “Access to modern equipment and resources played a vital role in the complex surgery. Workplace accidents, unfortunately, are not uncommon. So, everyone should learn basic first aid,” Dr Dande said.We also published the following articles recentlySumit Antil, Sheetal Devi win best male and female athlete at 1st Differently Abled Sports AwardsSumit Antil and Sheetal Devi won Best Male and Best Female athlete titles at the inaugural Differently Abled Sports Awards.

    "text": "Trump reports 'big progress' in tariff talks with Japanese officials\nJapan one of the first to start tariff negotiations\nWASHINGTON/TOYKO — President Donald Trump said there was \"big progress\" when he made the surprise move on Wednesday to negotiate directly with Japanese officials about the barrage of tariffs he has imposed on global imports.\n\"A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\" Trump said in a social media message that contained no details of the discussions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTokyo sent its Economic Revitalisation Minister Ryosei Akazawa to kickstart the talks, and he was due to brief reporters on Wednesday evening about the Washington meeting.\nThe Japanese official had hoped to limit the discussions to trade and investment matters. But Trump weighed in early on Wednesday, saying he would also be there to raise issues including how much Tokyo pays towards hosting U.S. troops in Japan, the biggest U.S. overseas deployment.\n\"Japan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and 'TRADE FAIRNESS',\" he said in a post on Truth Social.\n\"I will attend the meeting, along with Treasury & Commerce Secretaries. Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick participated along with other officials.\nTrump's announcement earlier this month of sharp tariff increases on trading partners around the world has ignited worries about risks of a recession, higher inflation and rising interest rates and sent financial markets reeling.\nBessent also wanted to discuss the thorny issue of exchange rates with Japan, one of the first countries to begin face-to-face negotiations since Trump announced sweeping duties on dozens of countries — both friend and foe — earlier this month.\nJapan has been hit with 24% levies on its exports to the United States although these rates have, like most of Trump's tariffs, been paused for 90 days. But a 10% universal rate remains in place as does a 25% duty for cars, a mainstay of Japan's export-reliant economy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBessent has said there is a \"first mover advantage\" given Washington has said more than 75 countries have requested talks. However, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that his country, a close U.S. ally, won't rush to reach a deal and does not plan to make big concessions.\nIshiba has, for now, ruled out countermeasures to the U.S. tariffs.\n\"The difficulty for the Japanese team is that the United States has created a huge amount of leverage for itself, unilaterally,\" said Kurt Tong, managing partner at The Asia Group, a Washington-based consultancy.\n\"The U.S. is offering to not hit Japan with sticks, and Japan is stuck in a position of offering a whole lot of carrots. And from their perspective, it feels like economic coercion,\" said Tong, a former State Department official.\nTrump has long complained about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan and other countries, saying U.S. businesses have been disadvantaged by trade practices and intentional efforts by other countries to maintain weak currencies.\nTokyo denies it manipulates its yen currency to gain advantage.\nTrade partners\nBessent met Vietnam's deputy prime minister last week to discuss trade and has invited South Korea's finance minister to Washington for talks next week. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will meet Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss tariffs imposed on the European Union.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe full scope of Wednesday's discussions was not yet clear.\nBessent has said he is hoping to strike deals that would cover tariffs, non-tariff barriers and exchange rates, though Tokyo had lobbied to keep the latter separate.\nPossible Japanese investment in a multi-billion dollar gas project in Alaska could also feature, Bessent has said.\nJapan hopes that pledges to expand investment in the U.S. will help to convince the U.S. that the two countries can achieve a \"win-win\" situation without tariffs, Akazawa said ahead of his departure.\n_________________________________________________",

    "text": "The Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat released the results of the Gujarat State Institutional Rating Framework (GSIRF) 2024 on Thursday. This ranking system, designed to help students choose the best universities and colleges in the state, was unfortunately delayed by six months this year, limiting its validity to the next six months.\nA total of 564 institutes participated in various categories, including 40 universities and 524 colleges. As many as 16 universities got 5+ or 5-star rating, while 34 colleges got 5 stars. Announced at a meeting of vice chancellors in Gandhinagar, the education department introduced a new “5+ star” rating as the highest possible distinction. This accolade was awarded to four universities following a rigorous evaluation process. The existing 5-star rating remains the highest rank for the other 10 categories. Education minister Rushikesh Patel announced that, in addition to the four universities receiving the 5+ star rating, a total of 44 colleges and institutes affiliated with 16 universities achieved a 5-star rating this year. Patel and his colleagues from the education department felicitated the VCs of these universities and presented them with certificates of excellence.\nUniversity rankings\nGujarat University made history by becoming the only public university to achieve a 5+ Star rating in the GSIRF, securing its position as the top-ranked institution. It shares this honour with three Centres of Excellence: Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Nirma University and CEPT University. Nine other universities were awarded 5-star ratings, including Ahmedabad University, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT) and Gujarat Technological University.\nPharmacy rankings\nThe Pharmacy category saw the highest number of institutes receiving 5-star ratings. A total of 10 colleges earned this distinction, with Nirma University’s Institute of Pharmacy taking first place.\nCollege rankings\nEight colleges achieved the top rank of 5 stars this year. PD Patel Institute of Applied Science, affiliated with CHARUSAT, leads the pack, followed by Indukaka Ipcowala Institute of Management, also affiliated with CHARUSAT. Interestingly, no college from Ahmedabad got 5-star rating.\nInnovation rankings\nDespite Gujarat’s reputation for fostering innovation and business, the Innovation category had no 5-star colleges or institutes. Only two institutions made the list: Ganpat University with a 3-star rating and Pramukh Swami Science and HD Patel Arts College with a 2-star rating.\nVarsity Leaders says\nNeerja Gupta\nVC, Gujarat University\n“Achieving the highest rating is immensely satisfying, especially given that we scored 100 out of 100 in several evaluation categories. I believe our new initiatives in line with the National Education Policy (NEP), such as introducing professors of practice, establishing research parks, supporting start-ups with active research, and attracting foreign students, have significantly boosted our score, in addition to our strong academic performance. Building on our 5-star ratings over the past three years, we have now progressed to a 5+ star rating.”\nDr S Sundar Manoharan\nDirector General, Pandit Deendayal\nEnergy University\n“This achievement is the result of concerted efforts in industry-academia partnerships, leading to two Skill India initiatives for manufacturing solar panels and semiconductors. PDEU designed these initiatives, the Government of Gujarat funded them, and industry OEM partners sustained them.”\nDr Anup K Singh,\nDirector General, Nirma University\n“Nirma University is consistently improving its academic performance and is poised to become a leading national university. In addition to the university itself, our Institute of Architecture and Planning, Institute of Technology, Institute of Law, and Institute of Pharmacy have all achieved 5-star ratings in their respective categories.”\nProf Tridip Suhrud,\nProvost, CEPT University\n“We are committed to excellence in architecture, planning, design, technology, urban management, education, and research. We are honoured to be rated as a 5+ star university and top-ranked in the architecture category in the state, alongside the top educational institutes in Gujarat. This recognition reaffirms our dedication to providing world-class education, undertaking groundbreaking research, and creating impactful solutions through our collaboration with the industry.”\nGSIRF 2024 Rankings",

    "text": "Los virus se encuentran entre los seres vivos más pequeños de la Tierra. Pequeños pero peligrosos ya que transportan patógenos que causan infecciones comunes. Estos parásitos infectan las células y se contagian, mediante contacto directo o indirecto con un individuo ya infectado. Puede que estén omnipresentes en la Tierra, pero en la actualidad todavía sabemos muy poco sobre ellos. Pero el desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial está acelerando la investigación en este ámbito. En un nuevo estudio publicado el 9 de octubre en la revista Celúlalos investigadores revelan que han descubierto 70.500 nuevos virus de ácido ribonucleico (ARN) utilizando IA. Muchas de ellas serían “bizarras”, completamente diferentes a lo que conocemos. Para su trabajo, los investigadores utilizaron una herramienta llamada ESMFold (desarrollada por Meta). Esto último les permitió examinar la predicción de la estructura de las proteínas. Es decir: adivinar la forma 3D de una proteína a partir de su mezcla de aminoácidos. Esta forma determina cómo funcionará en el cuerpo. Utilizando un método de “metagenómica” que implica analizar todos los genomas de un entorno sin aislar cada virus, los científicos han descubierto nuevos virus de ARN. Para identificarlos, entrenaron a la IA para que identificara una parte de su genoma que produce la proteína RdRp, necesaria para copiar su ARN.

    "text": "Former Premier League star, Wilfried Zaha, has completed a surprise loan move to MLS side, Charlotte FC after a poor spell in Europe.\nWilfried Zaha Completes Surprise Loan Move To MLS Side The Ivory Coast international will join Charlotte FC from Galatasaray on loan, in a deal that is set to last until January 2026.\nA key part of this move was Charlotte FC’s manager, Dean Smith, who will be a familiar face for Zaha with the two both being in the Premier League at similar times.\nZaha’s career has failed to progress since leaving the Premier League in July 2023, failing to impress in Turkey and underwhelming during his loan move to Lyon this season.\nIn fact, the former Crystal Palace player has not made a competitive appearance since December 7th and made just one start for Lyon in the 2024/25 campaign.\nThe structure of Zaha’s signing means he will take up a ‘Designated Player’ spot and international roster place, which allows teams in the MLS to have three players that would go over the salary cap limit.\nThis deal will be sending huge excitement across Charlotte, as signing a player of this calibre is huge and the Franchise’s General Manager, Zoran Krneta, spoke about adding Zaha to the side.\nHe said: “Wilfred is a world class talent who has proven himself at the highest level of the sport as an elite goal scorer and chance creator.\n“His performances in the Premier League and on the international level speak for themselves and we are confident that Wilfred can make an immediate impact in Major League Soccer.\n“He provides valuable versatility in the attacking areas of the pitch and adds that little bit of magic to our front line that can help us win more games.\n“We are delighted to add a player of Wilfred’s pedigree and experience to our squad, and we’re excited to welcome him to Charlotte.”\nDuring his time in England, Zaha played for Crystal Palace and Manchester United, coming through the ranks a Palace before spending an underwhelming season in Manchester and returning to Palace.\nContributing to 142 goals in 458 matches (90G+52A), Zaha left Crystal Palace as one of their best ever players and is still their leading scorer in the Premier League.y",

    "text": "Abdourahmane Ridouane, qui dirige la mosquée Al Farouk de Pessac, située en banlieue de Bordeaux et considérée comme \"d\"obédience salafiste\" par les autorités, a été interpellé chez lui vers 6h30 ce jeudi 8 août, a indiqué son avocat Me Sefen Guez Guez. Le président de la mosquée de Pessac (Gironde), de nationalité nigérienne, a été interpellé ce jeudi 8 août au matin dans le cadre d'une procédure d'expulsion, a appris l'Agence France-Presse (AFP) auprès de son avocat. Cela intervient quelques jours après une décision de justice obligeant le préfet de Gironde à réexaminer sa demande de renouvellement de titre de séjour.\nAbdourahmane Ridouane, qui dirige la mosquée Al Farouk de Pessac, située en banlieue de Bordeaux et considérée comme \"d\"obédience salafiste\" par les autorités, a été interpellé chez lui vers 6h30 ce jeudi, a indiqué son avocat Me Sefen Guez Guez.\nLe passeport nigérien du quinquagénaire n'a pas été retrouvé par les policiers qui ont perquisitionné le domicile de l'imam ainsi que la mosquée, a ajouté son conseil. L'opération a eu lieu dans le cadre d'un arrêté ministériel d'expulsion publié lundi, a confirmé une source proche du dossier.\nDeux procédures en parallèle Le ministère de l'Intérieur a pris un arrêté d'expulsion le 5 août dernier. Il reproche à Abdourahmane Ridouane, déjà sous le coup d'une assignation à résidence durant la période des Jeux olympiques, la diffusion sur les réseaux sociaux \"d'une idéologie hostile aux valeurs et institutions de la République française\".\nLes autorités l'accusent également \"de publications à teneur antisémite et haineuse à l'encontre d'Israël et des juïfs\", en relayant notamment, quatre jours après l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël le 7 octobre, un dessin de presse présentant l'organisation islamiste palestinienne comme un mouvement \"d'autodéfense\" et \"dédouanant cette organisation de la dimension terroriste de son action\".\nMais avant cet arrêté, le 17 juillet dernier, l'avocat de l'imam avait déposé devant le tribunal administratif de Bordeaux un recours. Le tribunal avait alors décidé, le 1er août, de contraindre le préfet de Gironde à réexaminer la demande de renouvellement de titre de séjour sous un mois. En attendant cette décision, la préfecture devait lui délivrer un \"récépissé\" de demande de titre de séjour, l'autorisant à travailler en France.\nL'avocat va déposer un recours En juin, une commission d'expulsion du tribunal judiciaire avait, de son côté, donné un avis consultatif défavorable concernant sa possible reconduite à la frontière.\nPour Me Guez Guez, cette \"nouvelle procédure s'assoit sur l'avis du tribunal judiciaire et la décision du tribunal administratif de Bordeaux\". \"L'État s'organise pour que l'opération soit menée à un rythme tellement rapide que le tribunal ne peut pas intervenir, c'est scandaleux\", a ajouté l'avocat, qui compte déposer un recours \"en urgence\".\nSur le même sujet \"J'appelle au calme\": l'imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi dénonce les menaces contre le maire de Bagnols-sur-Cèze Aube: Gérald Darmanin annonce l'expulsion d'un \"imam radicalisé\" sénégalais En 2022, des publications sur les réseaux sociaux avaient déjà conduit à une fermeture administrative de la mosquée de Pessac, finalement annulée par le tribunal administratif de Bordeaux puis le Conseil d'État.\nMélanie Vecchio avec Clément Boutin et AFP Les plus lus\nJO 2024 (triathlon): l'eau de la Seine était-elle trop polluée le jour de l'épreuve de relais mixte?",
