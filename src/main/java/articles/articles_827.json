    "title": "Harry Dunn's family accuses US government of 'obstructing' inquest into son's death and of 'not caring about UK lives'",
    "text": "PA Published: 13/06/2024- 22:47 The family of Harry Dunn have accused the US government of \"obstructing\" their son’s inquest after both representatives of the US embassy and driver Anne Sacoolas were absent from the four-day inquest. Sacoolas said in a witness statement that the crash which killed the teenage motorcyclist in August 2019 is something that will live with her \"every single day for the rest of my life\". The US State Department asserted diplomatic immunity on behalf of Sacoolas and she was able to leave the UK 19 days after the fatal collision. Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember criticised the US government over a lack of training for diplomatic personnel at RAF Croughton before Dunn’s death. The inquest heard that when asked what she believed had caused the collision, she told Northamptonshire Police officers: \"I drove like an American and drove on the American side of the road.\" Coroner Pember, recorded his death as being as a result of “injuries sustained during a head-on collision” with a car on the wrong side of the road. She also issued three prevention of future death notices: two to the Health Secretary regarding drugs carried by paramedics and overstretched ambulance services, and one to the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence addressing the US’s training of drivers in the UK. Speaking outside the court, Dunn’s mother, Charlotte Charles, reiterated her \"disgust\" at Sacoolas’s and the US Embassy’s decision not to attend the inquest – labelling it \"disrespectful\" to her son. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: She told reporters: \"It further bolsters my opinion that they have no regard for myself or my family, our wider family – they just don’t care.\" Sacoolas appeared before a High Court judge at the Old Bailey via video-link in December 2022, where she pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving. She was advised against attending her sentencing hearing by her employer, which prompted the family to say they were \"horrified\" that the US government was \"actively interfering in our criminal justice system\". Addressing the US government’s role prior to Harry’s death, spokesman Radd Seiger said: \"It was not enough for them to kill Harry. It wasn’t enough for them to then kick Harry’s family in their darkest hour and seek to deny and delay the justice that they were entitled to. Court artist drawing by Elizabeth Cook of US citizen Anne Sacoolas, 45, (right in TV screen), making an appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court via video-link from the United States PA \"As we have all seen this week their attitude and approach to keeping their British hosts safe has been laid to bare and they have positively obstructed the Coroner’s inquiry and deprived the family of the answers they were entitled to as to why no-one has ever addressed the issue of safety of UK citizens. \"The next question is why have the UK governments over the years been happy to sit on the sidelines watching this scandal unfold.\" He added: \"The US ambassador at the time of Harry’s death was Woody Johnson. He told the UK government after he died that there were far more important things than Harry’s life. \"That is the American government’s position. The lives of UK citizens like Harry ultimately do not matter.\"",

It comes as an amber cold health alert has also been launched for the county.\nIt was a cold start in Kent today (January 3) with &apos;feels like&apos; temperatures as low as -7C in Tunbridge Wells. And the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has put the amber cold health alert in place until midnight on January 8.\nThe alert warns the health and social care sector, responders, the voluntary and community sector and government departments when adverse temperatures are expected to impact people&apos;s health and wellbeing. Meanwhile, the yellow weather warning for snow and ice in Kent covers Tunbridge Wells, and other areas such as Maidstone, Ashford and swathes of Canterbury.\nForecasters said \"heavy snow and some freezing rain\" may cause disruption over the coming weekend. Tunbridge Wells is forecast for -2C at around 7am Saturday, the lowest temperature in all of Kent, with the only other area expected to drop that far being Ashford and Tenterden.\nHeavy snow is forecast for Saturday evening by the Met Office but is expected to turn to rain quickly (Image: Met Office) Heavy snow is forecast for Tunbridge Wells tomorrow evening, but it is expected to turn to rain quickly. Tunbridge Wells Borough Council&apos;s severe weather emergency protocol is largely about getting anyone sleeping rough inside.\nThe council uses the StreetLink platform, and has encouraged anyone who is worried about someone sleeping rough in the borough - or need help themselves from local services - to make an alert. StreetLink is used in England and Wales and it issues the alerts to the council and outreach teams.\nThe borough council said: \"This includes anyone who is sleeping outside, preparing to bed down, or sleeping somewhere not designed for habitation, such as a car. Individuals sleeping rough can also submit an alert to get help for themselves.\"\nHow can I make an alert using StreetLink? All you have to do is visit the platform. There are two buttons; one because you have seen someone sleeping rough and want to connect them to support services, and the other is for if you are sleeping rough and want to know what support services locally are there for you.\nClick on this link for more.\nKent forecast for Saturday, January 4 to Tuesday, January 7 For the South East, the weather forecast says tomorrow (January 4) will be a frosty start, with mist and fog patches clearing slowly. The Met Office said: \"Cold day follows, with hazy sunshine. Cloud thickening further ahead of snow spreading north after dusk Maximum temperature 5C.\"\nAnd for Sunday to Tuesday, the snow on Saturday will turn to rain in the early hours of Sunday, with rain, occasionally heavy, during the day but milder temperatures. More rain on Monday, but it will clear early, get colder but you should see some sun. It will remain cold on Tuesday\nChief medical officer at NHS Kent and Medway Kate Langford said: “Prolonged cold weather can be a risk for anyone, but those who are vulnerable, including elderly people, those with breathing difficulties, and children under five, are particularly at risk.\n\"If you have a family member, friend or neighbour who might be vulnerable please do keep an eye out for them.

    "text": "Following the ongoing negative impact of climate change and the threats it poses on human existence and the ecosystem, the Enugu state government has joined a dedicated community of climate activists in calling for urgent steps to mitigate the climate crisis through the reduction of carbon footprints.\nThis was as the government also presented its state’s climate policy, action plan and financial framework to enable the transition to a greener economy, describing the move as “an opportunity to reinvent ourselves, to innovate, and to lead in the face of global change.”\nThe government explained that the decision to take the drastic step was aimed at gradually transitioning from a coal city to a pioneer in clean energy solutions. It set ambitious targets for renewable energy generation in the face of greenhouse emissions that continue to threaten humanity and the environment.\nWhile assuring that plans were on top gear to place the state on the map of global climate activism, said the objective of reducing carbon footprint and other forms of pollution to its barest minimum would be achieved by harnessing the power of wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources.\nSpeaking on the state’s vision for a “Climate Resilient and Green Economy” during a workshop and stakeholder consultation for the Draft of Enugu State Climate Policy Action Plan and Climate Finance Framework held on Thursday, in Enugu, the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Chidiebere Onyia said the workshop was one of the series of engagements by the government towards a sustainable future for Enugu state and humanity.\n“The State Climate Policy will outline our vision for a climate-resilient and green economy, and our Climate Action Plan will guide our actions today and in the years to come. It will be a shared objective based on our local context, but also looking ahead to the opportunities presented by the global transition,” he said.\nOn the potential of Enugu state, Onyia said, “Our state has a rich history, deeply intertwined with coal production and the energy sector. For decades, our communities thrived on this industry’s economic benefits. However, as we stand at a crossroads, we must acknowledge the pressing challenges posed by climate change and the critical need to transition to a greener economy. This transition is more than an obligation; it is an opportunity to reinvent ourselves, innovate, and lead in the face of global change.”\nHe underscored that the draft policy’s principles are based on three key pillars: sustainability, inclusivity, and innovation. He added that sustainability will be at the heart of the climate policy.\n“We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and strengthening our ecosystems. This includes investing in renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, clean transportation, climate-smart agriculture and adopting circular economy principles that minimises waste and maximises resource use.\n“We must recognise that the transition to a sustainable future must leave no one behind. This is especially important in a state with a legacy tied to coal, which has benefited and harmed several communities.\n“We must support communities and workers in this sector through this transition by investing in training and reskilling programmed, ensuring that everyone has a role in the green economy,” he noted.\nIn his welcome address, the commissioner for environment and climate change, Prof. Sam Ugwu, observed that climate change has become a global challenge with its consequential impacts on livelihoods and ecosystems distorting national and subnational socio-economic values and activities, saying the reality of climate change was no longer a distant threat; but a pressing challenge that demands immediate and concerted action by all stakeholders.\n“In the face of these challenges, it is our responsibility to act decisively and collaboratively to mitigate these impacts and adapt to the changes that are already upon us,” he said.\nOn his part, Prof Chukwumerije Okereke, Senior Adviser to the Governor and President of the Society on Climate Policy and Sustainable Development, said the symposium was for the development of Enugu state climate change policy and action that would drive the mitigation steps deliberately initiated by the Mbah administration.",

    "text": "«Le Acli sono un luogo dove è possibile incontrare dei “santi della porta accanto”, che non finiscono sulle prime pagine dei giornali, ma a volte cambiano concretamente le cose, in bene»: è con queste parole che Papa Francesco ha accolto in udienza stamane nell'aula Paolo VI i 6mila aclisti giunti in Vaticano per celebrare l'ottantesimo anniversario dell'associazione. Folta la delegazione sannita: un centinaio provenienti da Benevento e provincia a popolare la carovana giunta in massa, oltre 500, da tutta la regione. Alla guida il presidente regionale Filiberto Parente, che ha portato in spalla la statua di San Giuseppe Lavoratore che Papa Pio XII benedisse nel 1955 e omaggiata dal Pontefice. «Le Acli - ha detto Francesco - siano voce di una cultura della pace, uno spazio in cui affermare che la guerra non è mai inevitabile mentre la pace è sempre possibile. Nel contesto di una società che è frammentata e di una cultura individualista, abbiamo un grande bisogno di luoghi in cui le persone possano sperimentare questo senso di appartenenza che sia creativo e dinamico, che aiuta a passare dall’io al noi, a elaborare insieme progetti di bene comune e a trovare le vie e i modi per realizzarli. È questa la vocazione dei vostri “circoli”: aprire le porte, tenerle aperte, accogliere le persone, permettere loro di costruire legami di solidarietà e senso di appartenenza, per intraprendere insieme un cammino di integrazione che sviluppa una cultura dell’incontro in una pluriforme armonia». «Il nostro impegno per la pace da sempre ci porta a costruire ponti di prossimità, ne sono una testimonianza le dodici edizioni del Cammino di Riconciliazione e Pace da Benevento a Pietrelcina, diventata una tappa fondamentale del nostro stile aclista. - dichiara il presidente Filiberto Parente - L'auspicio, con l'ausilio delle istituzioni, è quello di riproporre un percorso per sensibilizzare alla difesa della patria non armata e non violenta, obiettori di ogni forma di guerra, per declinare le parole di Papa Francesco alla fraternità universale, nessuno escluso» conclude.",

    "text": "MIAMI (WSVN) - After several birds were targeted and shot, X-rays revealed that BB gun bullets were inside the birds. Now, they are being treated at a rescue and rehabilitation center.The three birds were rescued during the week and were rushed to the Pelican Seabird Station in Miami.“A pelican with three pellets in the body, a hawk that has a fractured leg with pellets on either side, and we also had a turkey vulture come in with a pellet lodged in this sort of thoracic girdle, which is the neck area,” veterinarian Dr. Renata Schneider said.After the birds arrived at the center, Schneider performed an emergency surgery on the pelican.“This is the pellet that was removed from the spine of the pelican, and it was actually lodged in the spine,” Dr. Schneider said. “This is just outright cruelty to animals.”The pelican had complications after its surgery. Dr. Schneider was able to successfully remove the pellet, but sadly, the seabird died from other health complications.“He lost use of his legs over time, and then it just became impossible to eat,” she said. “It’s small, but depending on where they end up in a bird, they can cause a lot of damage.”A pellet was also removed from a turkey vulture, and it seemed to be recovering well in the non-profit’s care.A red-shouldered hawk was hit multiple times, and its femur was broken, but it is on the mend.“It’s a long, slow death for these animals if they’re not brought to us,” said Dr. Schneider. “There are other ways, more humane methods, to keep birds away. If it’s for sport and fun, there are certainly more humane ways to do that too. We don’t need to be hurting and harming our native wildlife that’s already facing so many challenges in South Florida.”Under Florida law, shooting a bird with a BB gun falls under animal cruelty and is thus considered a felony.All three cases have been referred to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

    "title": "There's a fungus among us: East Bay Parks puts out annual wild mushroom warning | News | PleasantonWeekly.com |",
    "text": "The Golden Chanterelle may be the state's new official mushroom, but the East Bay Regional Park District is reminding residents that some fungi are best appreciated for their beauty, not taste. The park district sent out its annual wild mushroom warning last Friday as winter rains spur spores and mushrooms begin popping up. There are two kinds that both people and pets need especially to avoid, and their names say it all: the death cap (Amanita phalloides) and the western destroying angel (Amanita ocreata). Both of these mushrooms contain amatoxins, which are molecules that are deadly to most animals -- even primates like us. Symptoms don't appear until up to 12 hours later, making them a great plot element in an Agatha Christie novel but causing extreme gastrointestinal distress that progresses to liver and kidney failure to anyone who ingests them. According to Dave Mason, public information supervisor for the park district, these species are responsible for most cases of mushroom poisonings in California. Both are mostly associated with oak trees and can be found anywhere that oak roots are present. The death cap is a medium to large mushroom that typically has a greenish-gray cap, according to Mason. It has white gills, a white ring around its stem, and a large white sac at the base of its stem. Not native to California, it was introduced to North America by being attached to the roots of European cork oaks and is now \"steadily colonizing the West Coast,\" said Mason. As for the western destroying angel, it is native to the state but nonetheless just as poisonous as the death cap. It is medium to large with a creamy white cap, white gills, a white ring around its stem that can disappear with age, and it enjoys the company of oak trees exclusively. It usually appears late winter and into spring. Anyone gamboling through the East Bay Parks should heed the warnings about these mushrooms, but Mason reminds all park visitors that the removal of any mushrooms is prohibited, edible or not. To learn more about other poisonous mushrooms in our area, go to ebparks.org/safety/trails/toxic-mushrooms or visit the Tilden Fungus Fair in late January ebparks.org/events/tilden-fungus-fair.",
