    "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. ( WHNS /Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed. According to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed. “As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in a Facebook post . “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.” The employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works. A man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat. He described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet. Brother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued. The shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer. Lilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other. “She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.

    "title": "Gordon Brown draws on close friendship with Rabbi Sacks in inaugural legacy lecture - Jewish News",
    "text": "The former prime minister Gordon Brown drew on his close friendship with Rabbi Lord Sacks when he delivered the inaugural lecture aimed at keeping alive the legacy and teachings of the former Chief Rabbi.\nBrown recalled in his talk on Wednesday being asked to write a foreword to a reprint of Jonathan Sacks’ book The Politics of Hope , and being so thrilled to be asked and so keen to do a good job that he worked on it even on his honeymoon. Then chancellor of the exchequer, he wanted to do justice to the earlier edition of the book. “I think I spent more time doing that than I spent on the budget that year,” he joked.\nRabbi Sacks died in November 2020. In his 22 years in the role of Chief Rabbi he became a global religious leader. As a philosopher and award-winning author, his was a respected moral voice. He was the laureate of the 2016 Templeton Prize in recognition of his “exceptional contributions to affirming life’s spiritual dimension” and was described by King Charles III, with whom he also had a warm friendship, as “a light unto this nation”.\nHis friendship with Brown had contributed to the sometimes light-hearted tone of the memorial lecture. The former Labour politician recalled: “Jonathan said to me one day, ‘I have one piece of advice for you: humour. Your speeches need humour. You’ve got to tell stories.”\nBrown, who was chancellor 1997-2007 and prime minister 2007-10, spoke of how Rabbi Sacks’ thought and writings had been a huge influence on him. He also spoke of the importance of morality to the politics and development of this country, and of the transformative power of hope. “Hope is more than optimism. It is not an expectation but an intention to do things,” Brown said. “A feeling that it can and will be done.”\nHope, along with faith and charity, were the themes of his hour-long lecture, organised by the Rabbi Sacks Legacy and delivered on a stage at King’s College London without notes, or the protection of a lectern.\nEarlier, Brown recalled the financial crisis of 2008-09, a point when he said he relied on Rabbi Sacks, “because I understood, as he understood, that this was not simply a financial crisis. This was a moral crisis. Bankers had awarded themselves bonuses they didn’t deserve, had taken risks they didn’t understand and people were buying goods they couldn’t afford.”\nIn April 2009, he gave a speech at St Paul’s Cathedral, the first speech in that church by a serving prime minister. “I’ll be honest,” Brown told his audience on Wednesday. “It was written mostly by Jonathan. I can acknowledge that now.”\nRabbi Jonathan Sacks: ‘He said we are stronger when we care for the weak, we are richer when we care for the poor, we are invulnerable when we care for the vulnerable’ He said: “When I was in government, working with the King of Saudi Arabia and the prime minister of Israel, working with other people, we could see the way the problems that existed could in future be solved.” In what appeared to be a reference to the current crisis in Israel and Gaza, he added: “There is a way forward, and I believe it is still possible, and we must never lose hope. Because hope is the starting point of everything that Jonathan Sacks wrote about.”\nBrown thought Rabbi Sacks had three principles he wanted us to follow. The first was to think of society as a common home that we build together. Britain is not a hotel or a country house, but a home where each of us has rights and responsibilities. The second is to think of Britain and a society: not as a contract but as a covenant built on values and beliefs that are shared. The third is the principle of partnership, where state, the market and communities work together. “Jonathan talks about a partnership where the whole is bound to be greater than the sum of the parts.”\nEverybody needed be involved if the problem of broken communities and broken families was to be solved, he said. The same went for the problem of integrating communities, the environment and violent extremism. But the biggest problem now, Brown said, was poverty, with up to six million children in this country going without basic necessities. “How can children have an equal access to hope, how can they realise their potential if they’re living in homes without kitchens and bedrooms with beds? There is desperation in towns and villages that ‘levelling up’ has passed by.”\nBrown said charities helping people in need were themselves struggling. “Jonathan said we are stronger when we care for the weak, we are richer when we care for the poor, we are invulnerable when we care for the vulnerable.”\nBrown spoke of the importance of philanthropy, which formed part of the idea of all of us doing something together. “I would like to take out of the memory of Jonathan Sacks that we have a new age of hope, that it is based on responsibilities and rights, that it is based on getting people equal access to hope, and it is based on his groundbreaking work on how we can partner together to make a better society, recognising the sheer power of social conscience and what it can achieve.”\nElliott Goldstein, chair of the Rabbi Sacks Legacy, thanked the speaker and said: “It is our hope that this annual lecture will continue to amplify Rabbi Lord Sacks’ role as a moral voice in our society, particularly in these difficult times.”\n ",

And that’s where it all began . But long before Ana María began to weave the networks of what would end up being an international brand, she had already taken firm steps in a man’s world.\nThe Civil War hit her family hard, and they moved to Madrid after the death of Ana María’s father in 1937.\nAlready in the capital he completed his high school studies and, In 1942, he began to study Chemistry at the Complutense University, when science was still a field in which women did not have much space.\nFive years later, Lajusticia not only managed to be one of the first women to finish her degree, but she did so with honors and soon became the head of the Minersa laboratories.\nIt was not until three decades later, already in the 70s, when He began to question his diet. and its deficiencies, in addition to an excess of carbohydrates in her daily life that led the chemist to delve into nutrition studies.\nYour personal experience to grow your brand\nIn 1979 the book with which we began this text came to light and then it all began.\n«The discovery on your own skin of how much and good a corrected and adjusted diet can do, turned the Basque into the champion of the magnesium cause and other elements that do so much good for our health,” they detail in their official biography.\nThat personal experience that most truthfully supported his statements was the spark that ignited success. The brand ‘Ana María Lajusticia’ was born.\nIf you go to the sales website now, you will find various products for the joints, emotional balance, muscle relaxation cardioprotectors, sleep products, vitamins… a whole world where we can choose what our body asks of us.\nA public humiliation and a blip in his success\nThis success of decades, however, has not been free of detractors or ups and downs in which its continuity as a company came to be jeopardized.\nPart of the scientific community always turned its back on him and his confrontation with the doctor was very famous. Francisco Grande Covián friend and colleague of Severo Ochoa, during the program ‘La Clave’ on TVE’s La2 that was presented by José Luis Balbín.\nIn that gathering, the famous nutritionist and researcher called her a fake, which caused her emerging products to begin to be viewed with suspicion.\nCovián was convinced that Lajusticia was a “undocumented and irresponsible” as he mentioned in one of his books. Time, the truth is, has taken away his reason.\nThe salvation of sport and a gigantic legacy\nAnd the use of magnesium and collagen is more topical than ever and can be found in countless specialized centers and even supermarkets, echoing an idea, a study, a work that began in Spain with Ana María Lajusticia.\nAfter the incident in ‘The Key’ and its negative repercussions, sport served as a lifesaver for the company, given the positive effects on worked and demanded bodies of the products they sold.\nThe course of life changed again and the impact of Lajusticia grew again to the giant we know today. His steps in a world that was not going to give him any ease They ended up making a path that is now passable forever.\n#Ana #María #Lajusticia #pioneer #humiliated #doctor #television #built #empire #convictions",

But, if it’s to complement a bigger or more intricate design with black or color-rich sections, you’ll be able to be more flexible with your choice of ink.\nIngredients\nAnother important thing to consider when choosing white tattoo ink is the ingredients. Check the label carefully to see whether your ink of choice contains ingredients that create a crisp color tone (like titanium oxide or zinc oxide) and that the ink’s formula is trusted.\nIf you have sensitive skin or any allergies, you should also check to see if there are any ingredients that are likely to cause you issues. That’s the last thing you want when inking your body.\nSafety\nLast but certainly not least, you should make sure that the brand, as well as the product you’re looking to use, is 100% tried, tested, and safe. Look at the brand’s track record, read reviews, and make sure everything is above board before pressing the ‘buy’ button.\nWhy you should trust us\nI only have a couple of permanent tattoos (big thanks to my niece for the\ntemporary sticker sleeve), but I love body art. I also know many body ink lovers and professional tattoo artists.\nIt doesn’t hurt that I’ve been researching and writing about all things man with FashionBeans for quite some time now. From conversations with experts, I was able to develop a tried-and-tested shortlist. I also did extensive web-based research and product comparisons to finalize my epic shortlist of the best white tattoo ink products on the market.

So, consider your personal inking needs, work your way back through the list—and take your pick.\n-\n- What’s the best way to use white tattoo ink?\nWithout the right skills or approach, even the best tattoo ink will fail to create a head-turning masterpiece. White tattoo ink is no exception.\nWhen you’re using white tattoo ink, it’s important to have a clear-cut vision. You can use white ink to create very subtle, chunky line designs. Or you can use it on black ink to highlight certain parts of your design. It’s also possible to use white ink as shading with certain visual designs.\nWhatever you use your white ink for visually, make sure you do your prep beforehand and follow the manufacturer’s instructions down to the letter.\n- Does white tattoo ink fade?\nWhite tattoo ink does fade. It tends to fade at a similar rate as black or colored inks and, in some cases, can morph into a slightly yellowish tone over time.\nThe best way to preserve the life of your white tattoo ink is to use a good\naftercare productas well as a good tattoo soap. Oh, and don’t go for cheap inks with poor reviews or poor-quality ingredients!\n-",

    "text": "Dans les supermarchés ou les magasins de vêtements, beaucoup de produits affichent une origine française.Pourtant, très peu sont totalement confectionnés dans l'Hexagone, de la conception à la fabrication.Le JT de TF1 vous aide à y voir plus clair dans la provenance des produits que vous achetez au quotidien. Un drapeau tricolore, une inscription \"préparé en France\" ou \"designed in France\"... Ces dernières années, le label [Made in France](https://www.tf1info.fr/conso/enquete-made-in-france-un-produit-sur-cinq-affiche-une-mention-trompeuse-2298266.html) est devenu un vrai argument de vente auprès des consommateurs. Pourtant, beaucoup de ces mentions sont tout simplement fausses. Exemple dans un supermarché avec un paquet de cordons-bleus, dans le reportage en tête de cet article. L'origine française y est clairement affichée. Mais en y regardant de plus près, les viandes de poulet et de dinde viennent de l'Union européenne. Un seul logo à chercher : \"Origine France Garantie\" Dans l'alimentation et le textile, cette technique est très répandue mais pas illégale. Pour Anthony Vitorino, rédacteur en chef du magazine Fait en France, \"c'est de la technique marketing\". Le but : pousser les consommateurs [à acheter](https://www.tf1info.fr/conso/video-reportage-grande-surface-made-in-france-ou-fast-fashion-on-a-fait-passer-l-epreuve-du-lavage-a-ces-trois-sweats-2299571.html). Ceux interrogés au micro de TF1 se disent un peu perdus : \"Je préférerais que ce soit plus explicite\", reconnait une femme. Le ministère de l'Économie prévient : \"La mention 'Fabriqué en France' ne signifie pas que 100 % des étapes de fabrication d'un produit ont été réalisées en France.\" Mais alors, comment s'y retrouver et être sûr d'acheter français ? Le véritable label est représenté par le logo \"Origine France Garantie\". Un organisme indépendant vérifie que chaque produit a bien été fabriqué en France. La marque de jeans 1083 est l'une de celles à bénéficier de cette certification. Son fondateur, Thomas Huriez, dénonce une [concurrence déloyale](https://www.tf1info.fr/conso/chaussure-habillement-face-a-la-concurrence-du-marche-chinois-les-chausseurs-francais-resistent-2284297.html) : \"Voir que ça génère de la triche, avec des marques qui disent que c'est fait en France alors que ça ne l'est pas, c'est un peu frustrant car c'est certainement un manque à gagner pour nous\", s'insurge-t-il.",
