    "text": "MUFG has completed the first fully digital trade finance transaction from its Gift City branch in India, processing a US$15mn letter of credit for Tata International in a matter of hours on Xalts’ blockchain-based network.\nThe Japan-headquartered lender says in an announcement the transaction was undertaken on behalf of the Singapore-based treasury centre of Tata International, which is the trading arm of Indian conglomerate Tata Group.\nThe bank used Xalts, which provides connectivity across a network of banks, corporates and logistics providers and allows users to digitise and automate end-to-end trade finance processes.\nMUFG says the letter of credit was digitally negotiated, prepared, applied for and accepted “within three hours, compared to a document-based transaction which would usually take up to two days”.\n“This breakthrough significantly enhances international trade efficiency and underlines MUFG’s dedication to leveraging technology in support of trade digitalisation, while enhancing its suite of transaction banking solutions for its clients,” the bank says.\nBelinda Han, managing director and head of transaction banking for Asia Pacific at MUFG, says the transaction “exemplifies our dedication to leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive sustainable growth and deliver exceptional value to our clients”.\nDeputy chief executive of MUFG India, Shashank Joshi, says the bank intends to build on the success of the transaction and “further replicate it with our wider set of clients”.\nThe bank adds it is committed to India’s vision of becoming a “global financial hub”, and is now one of the largest lenders active at the Gift City International Financial Services Centre.\nFor Tata International, connecting its multiple treasury centres to its trading counterparties and to MUFG creates “efficiencies and auditability for every financial instruction executed electronically”, says group head of corporate finance and treasury Sumit Sharma.\n“For a trading company like Tata International, the time saved in trade finance processes has a direct impact on our bottom line,” he says.\nSupreet Kaur, chief operating officer at Xalts, says the company looks forward to enabling “more corporate treasuries to reduce time, cost and manual effort in managing treasury and trade finance operations”.\nThe announcement also marks a milestone for Xalts, which acquired the Contour network last year and has since introduced new functionality and expanded efforts to digitise trade processes .\nMost recently, it has introduced AI agents, which carry out tasks such as data management and reconciliation, banking queries and instruction, and trade finance processes, the company says.",

    "text": "Hamas has accepted a cease-fire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar TEL AVIV, Israel — Hamas has accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire in its seven-month war with Israel, the Palestinian group said in a statement Monday. The announcement came hours after [Israel ordered](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249298738/israel-palestinians-evacuate-rafah) tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians to evacuate parts of southern Gaza, signaling a ground assault might be imminent. It is not immediately clear what the proposal entails, nor what Israel's position is. An Israeli official [told local TV](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/artc-hamas-announces-it-has-agreed-to-proposed-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal-with-israel) that the Israeli government was \"checking which formula Hamas has agreed to.\" In a statement late Monday, Hamas said its top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence minister \"of the Hamas movement's approval of their proposal regarding the cease-fire agreement.\" The announcement on Monday — on the eve of the Gaza war's seven-month mark — raised hopes for some that the fighting may come to a pause.

    "title": "Unknown 18th century hymns discovered in Wales",
    "text": "Unknown 18th-century hymns discovered in Wales\nIf you ever find yourself at a rugby game in Wales, don’t be surprised when the crowds begin to belt out Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah, known as Bread of Heaven to the Welsh. Called the “Land of Song,” hymns in Wales are not just for church services. They have played a prominent role in the life of the nation by preserving and transmitting its language and culture. Even as churches continue to close, formal and impromptu hymn sings remain.\nWhich is why the recent discovery of some unique 18th-century hymns is so significant.\nMany of these newly discovered hymns are about addiction, mental illness, and “the dark side of the psyche,” said singer-composer Lleuwen Steffan, who discovered the trove of hymns. “You have one that talks of drunkenness and alcoholism that is transformed into drinking the wine from God’s cellar.”\nSteffan, who is Welsh, discovered the hymns among the oral history recordings made by\nRobin Gwndaf for the archives of St. Fagan’s National History Museum in Wales.\n“I knew they were not in the current hymn book,” she told The Guardian. “I checked the older editions and spoke to experts on Welsh hymns and indeed they were not in any of the older hymn books either.”\nWelsh hymns derive from the nonconformist tradition, predominantly Calvinist Methodists (now the Presbyterian Church of Wales), which experienced a revival in the 1730s. Before the publication of the first Welsh\nhymn book, Diferion y Cyssegr, in 1802, hymns were transmitted orally at house church gatherings called seiadau or “experience meetings.” There the small group of Christians would share their “spiritual experiences” followed by prayer and conversation. Then a single member would spontaneously begin to sing a hymn.\nThese hymns reflect the solo nature of the performance and intimacy of these seiadau gatherings. They are a\ndialogue with God, asking such questions as, “Tell me, was I that sinner?”\nIt is unclear why these early hymns were left out of the official Welsh hymn books. Steffan believes the committees that determined which hymns were included didn’t approve of their “dark” content. A more likely explanation may be that, as the house churches grew and worship became more corporate and mainstream, these candid hymns featuring such a personal and specific focus no longer suited the new setting.\nWith a new century came changes in taste as well. In the 19th century, Welsh churches began appointing professional music leaders to improve congregational singing. In 1826, the leader at a Baptist church in Penycae conducted weeknight practices to teach the congregation how to sing in parts. Older members at the neighboring Calvinist Methodist church, who had always sung in unison, disapproved, believing “such activity encouraged the young to become too frivolous and materialistic.”\nIronically, according to the late hymnologist\nAlan Luff, four-part harmony eventually became “an indicator of innate Welshness.”\nIn the village of Rhiwlas in Eryri, where Steffan grew up, there was no shop or pub.\nSunday school with its hymn singing was a “major social gathering.” Drawn by the music, she continued to attend Sunday school as a teenager even though her parents were not avid churchgoers.\n“Welsh hymns resonate with me in ways that other music does not,” Steffan said. “They have changed my life in music.”\nAfter her discovery at St. Fagan’s, Steffan knew she needed to find a way to present these hymns to the public. “They wouldn’t leave me alone. I had the responsibility to share them. I felt I had a real connection with them. They really are a treasure.”\nThe product of Steffan’s research and musical talent is a concert tour she’s calling\nTafod Arian, which means “Silver Tongue.”\n“I have recordings of various people speaking about seeing silver tongues falling from the skies during the time of the 1904 revival,” Steffan explained. “It was a common vision during the 1859 revival too.”\nIn Tafod Arian, Steffan weaves together electronica, archival recordings of hymns and spoken words, and new recordings of the descendants of those original singers into an accompaniment for her own singing and playing.\nIn addition to recorded testimony about the 1904 revival, Steffan also includes a recording of a sermon in the half-sung, half-spoken style known as Hwyl Gymreig.\nHwyl can mean “passion” or “fervor,” but it also brings to mind the\nsails of a ship filling with wind, which is fitting for a preacher thought to be filled with the mighty wind of the Holy Spirit.\nTwo forms of hymns not commonly experienced outside of Wales, the plygain and the Canu Pwnc, are also featured in the concert. Both styles date back to the pre-Reformation church but nonconformist churches of the 18th century adapted and preserved them for Protestant churches.\nPlygian began as an early morning mass but found new life as a service of Christmas carols held Christmas morning between 3 and 6 a.m. On Pentecost, or Whitsun as it is known in the United Kingdom, four Baptist churches in North Pembrokeshire gather together to sing Canu Pwnc, a type of Gregorian chant. In this ancient form of hymn singing, the congregation chants a chapter of scripture and then is quizzed by the minister as to its meaning.\nFor the modern adaptation, members’ answers are prepared in advance, but the musical exchange was originally part of the catechism of candidates in the pre-Reformation church.\n“Before putting these hymns on stage, I wanted to take them back to the chapels where they were born,” she said.\nThe Baptists of North East Wales, the Presbyterian Church of Wales, and the Union of Welsh Independents are funding the first leg of Steffan’s tour, which will take place in 50 Welsh churches. After the church leg, Steffan will present Tafod Arian on a grander scale in concert venues across the UK with\nbacking from the National Eisteddfod of Wales.\nThose who aren’t fluent in Welsh can still enjoy the show, Steffan said.\n“It will be my pleasure to provide explanations and translations to audience members who do not understand Welsh. This work belongs to all of us, and I’m here to share.” Baptist News Global",

    "title": "Parenting Styles Influence Adolescent Self-Injury Coping",
    "text": "The increasing prevalence of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) among adolescents has emerged as a concerning mental health trend worldwide, spurring extensive research into its underlying causes and potential interventions. A recent pivotal study published in BMC Psychiatry delves into the intricate relationship between parenting styles and the coping mechanisms adopted by adolescents with and without NSSI behaviours. This groundbreaking comparative analysis bridges a critical knowledge gap by highlighting how differing parental approaches can significantly influence emotional regulation and problem-solving strategies during this vulnerable developmental stage.\nCentral to this investigation is the recognition that adolescence is a period marked by heightened emotional volatility and identity formation, rendering coping mechanisms an essential determinant of psychological resilience. The research team, led by Wang, Chen, and Hu, conducted a meticulous cross-sectional study involving 622 adolescents aged 11 to 18 from both clinical and community settings in Ningbo, China. This sample included 311 adolescents diagnosed with NSSI and an equal-sized control group free of such behaviours, enabling a robust comparative framework to dissect the psychosocial variables at play.\nThe comprehensive dataset integrated detailed parental and family background information with validated psychometric assessments to map specific parenting styles—encompassing dimensions such as affection, control, and preference—and their correlation with adolescent coping schemas. The methodological arsenal employed statistical tools ranging from chi-square tests to stepwise regression analyses, ensuring that nuanced interrelations were captured with empirical rigor. This approach underscored the dynamic interplay between familial environmental factors and the adolescents’ adaptive or maladaptive coping responses.\nOne of the salient revelations of the study is the pronounced link between family discord and the incidence of NSSI behaviours. Adolescents from families characterized by disharmony exhibited markedly higher tendencies toward self-injurious actions, suggesting that emotional instability within the domestic setting acts as a potent risk factor. Moreover, parental education level emerged as a significant variable, with lower parental educational attainment correlating with increased NSSI risk, potentially reflecting broader socio-economic stressors and attitudinal differences toward mental health awareness.\nA particularly novel finding lies in the differentiated impact of maternal behaviours across the NSSI and non-NSSI groups. In adolescents without self-injurious tendencies, an excessive maternal preference, although well-intentioned, was inversely related to their problem-solving capacities, possibly by fostering dependency or diminishing autonomy. Conversely, in the NSSI cohort, exposure to negative parenting styles—characterized by harshness, rejection, or lack of emotional support—showed strong associations with coping strategies centered around emotional avoidance or rumination. These emotional-oriented coping mechanisms may perpetuate mental distress, exacerbating self-injurious tendencies.\nThe researchers emphasize that these differential patterns illuminate critical pathways through which parenting styles can either buffer against or contribute to maladaptive adolescent behaviours. This underscores the necessity for targeted family-centered psychological interventions, which focus specifically on enhancing parental understanding, emotional attunement, and positive reinforcement to nurture healthier coping frameworks within at-risk youth populations.\nFrom a clinical perspective, the study’s insights advocate for the integration of psychoeducational programs that equip parents with the skills to foster secure attachment and constructive emotional communication. By mitigating the negative impacts of dysfunctional parental practices, such programs can disrupt the cycle of emotional dysregulation, offering adolescents more effective tools to navigate stress and interpersonal conflicts. This is especially pertinent given that adolescence is a critical window for the prevention of escalatory patterns that may culminate in more severe psychiatric disorders or suicide risk.\nFurthermore, the research delineates the heterogeneity inherent in adolescent psychological responses, emphasizing that uniform interventions may fall short unless individualized coping profiles and familial contexts are considered. This precision-oriented approach aligns with emerging paradigms in mental health care, advocating for customization based on psychosocial and environmental determinants rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.\nThe broader societal implications of this study reverberate beyond the clinical realm, highlighting the pivotal role of parental education and community awareness in curbing the tide of adolescent NSSI. Enhancing public health strategies to promote positive parenting, alongside school-based mental health literacy initiatives, could create a more supportive ecosystem that fosters resilience among vulnerable youth.\nIn synthesizing these findings, Wang and colleagues contribute a critical piece to the complex puzzle of adolescent mental health, elucidating how nuanced parenting behaviours sculpt coping strategies that either predispose to or protect against NSSI. Their work advocates for a paradigm shift in preventative mental health care, emphasizing the symbiotic nature of family dynamics and individual psychological adaptation.\nAs NSSI rates continue to climb globally, the urgency of such research cannot be overstated. Future longitudinal studies and multi-centre trials inspired by this work could further unravel causal mechanisms and inform scalable interventions. Until then, the imperative of cultivating nurturing family environments as a frontline defence against adolescent self-injury remains clear.\nThis study not only deepens our understanding of the psychosocial substrates of NSSI but also serves as a clarion call for integrated multi-level efforts spanning families, schools, healthcare providers, and policymakers dedicated to safeguarding adolescent well-being in an increasingly complex world.",

    "text": "Illinois star Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended following rape charge\nIllinois basketball star Terrence Shannon Jr. has been suspended from all team activities after he was charged with rape.\nA warrant was issued for Shannon’s arrest on Wednesday by the Douglas County district attorney’s office in Kansas. Shannon turned himself in on Thursday on a charge of “rape; sexual intercourse without consent and use of force,”\naccording to ESPN’s Myron Medcalf. The senior posted $50,000 bail and planned to return to Illinois.\nIllinois said in a statement that the alleged incident took place in September when Shannon was in Lawrence, Kansas, to attend the Illinois-Kansas State football game. Shannon was “not in Lawrence on official University business, nor was he a member of the University’s travel party,” according to the school.\nUniversity officials said they were aware of the investigation involving Shannon but that they did not receive “actionable information” until the arrest warrant was issued. Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said the school has “zero tolerance for sexual misconduct” but that student-athletes are afforded “appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations.”\nShannon’s attorney, Mark P. Sutter, said in a statement that Shannon has cooperated with authorities since the allegations were made in September. Sutter said Shannon is “innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.”\nShannon, who transferred to Illinois from Texas Tech following the 2020-21 season, is averaging a team-high 21.7 points per game. He has been the 11th-ranked Illini’s best player.",

    "text": "Astrónomos alertan sobre contaminación lumínica por proyecto energético cerca de telescopios en Chile\nEl Observatorio Europeo Austral (ESO) alertó el jueves sobre la amenaza que podría significar para el funcionamiento del observatorio Paranal, en el norte de Chile, la construcción de un proyecto para desarrollar hidrógeno y amoniaco verde, debido a la contaminación lumínica.\nLos científicos levantaron las alarmas frente al inicio de la tramitación ambiental de un \"megaproyecto\" para producir hidrógeno y amoniaco verde por parte de la empresa chilena AES Andes.\nEl proyecto se emplazaría en Taltal, región de Antofagasta, a entre cinco y 11 km de distancia de Paranal, que alberga al Very Large Telescope, uno de los instrumentos ópticos más poderosos del mundo. Junto a él, se construye el Extremely Large Telescope, con aún mayor capacidad.\n\"Las emisiones de polvo durante la construcción, el aumento de la turbulencia atmosférica y, especialmente la contaminación lumínica, tendrán un impacto irreparable en las capacidades de observación astronómica\", advirtió el director general de ESO, Xavier Barcons, en un comunicado.\nParanal fue inaugurado en 1999 y se ubica en pleno desierto de Atacama, el más árido del mundo, un lugar ideal para la observación astronómica por su clima seco, altitud y ausencia de nubes y lluvia.\nEl complejo es parte de la red de observatorios astronómicos con los que cuenta Chile, entre ellos el radiotelescopio Alma y el telescopio óptico de La Silla, también en el norte de Chile.\nA fines de diciembre, la compañía AES Andes informó que el proyecto incluye \"la producción de hidrógeno y amoniaco verde, así como el desarrollo de energía solar, eólica y de almacenamiento en baterías\", en línea con el objetivo de Chile de ampliar el origen renovable de su matriz energética.\nAES Andes no emitió comentarios ante una petición de la AFP.\nPara Itziar de Gregorio, representante de ESO en Chile, \"es crucial considerar ubicaciones alternativas para este megaproyecto que no pongan en peligro uno de los tesoros astronómicos más importantes del mundo\".\nEn octubre de 2024, comenzó a regir en Chile una nueva norma lumínica para resguardar lugares cercanos a los observatorios, pero también la salud de personas y animales.\nLa normativa establece límites de luminosidad, horarios máximos de funcionamiento de pantallas publicitarias, además de promover la transición hacia el uso de luz cálida, menos contaminante.\npa/atm",
