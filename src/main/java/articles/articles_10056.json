    "text": "O secretário de Estado do Vaticano, cardeal Pietro Parolin, descartou uma possível renúncia do papa Francisco. Em entrevista ao jornal jornal italiano Corriere della Sera , publicada neste sábado (22.fev.2025), ele afirmou que “especulações são inúteis” e que a principal preocupação neste momento é a recuperação do pontífice, internado no Hospital Gemelli, em Roma.\n“Nosso foco é na saúde do Santo Padre, em sua recuperação e no retorno ao Vaticano. O restante são apenas rumores” , afirmou Parolin.\nFormulário de cadastro alertas grátis do Poder360 concordo com os termos da LGPD . O cardeal retornou recentemente de Burkina Faso, onde esteve para encontros com a comunidade cristã e para apoiar esforços de paz no país, que enfrenta ataques terroristas e violência de grupos armados.\nParolin afirmou que se colocou à disposição para visitar o papa Francisco, mas que, por enquanto, não houve necessidade. Segundo ele, o ideal é que Francisco receba o menor número possível de visitas para garantir um descanso adequado e a eficácia dos tratamentos.\n“Graças a Deus, as notícias do hospital são positivas. Ele está se recuperando e já recebeu alguns documentos para trabalhar. O que indica que está bem”, disse.\nCRISE ASMÁTICA O Vaticano informou neste sábado (22.fev.2025) que o papa Francisco enfrentou uma crise prolongada de asma e precisou passar por uma transfusão de sangue .\nOs exames realizados mostraram plaquetopenia (diminuição do número de plaquetas no sangue) associada à anemia, o que levou à necessidade da transfusão.\n“O Santo Padre continua vigilante e passou o dia na poltrona, embora mais debilitado do que ontem” , informou, ressaltando que Francisco “não está fora de perigo” .\nO pontífice, de 88 anos, está internado no hospital Gemelli, em Roma, desde 14 de fevereiro, depois de dias de dificuldade para respirar. Ele foi inicialmente diagnosticado com bronquite, mas exames revelaram uma pneumonia bilateral.\nO estado de saúde de Francisco preocupa o Vaticano, já que as atividades exigem fisicamente do papa. Desde que assumiu o cargo em 2013, Francisco foi internado 5 vezes.\ncompartilhe esta imagem",

    "title": "Adam Sandler's Dramatic Turn in 'Spaceman': A Journey from Comedy to Space Solitude",
    "text": "Adam Sandler, traditionally known for his comedic roles, takes a surprising and emotional turn as Jakub Procházka, a Czech astronaut on a solo mission to Jupiter, in the latest Netflix movie 'Spaceman'. Directed by Johan Renck and based on Jaroslav Kalfar’s novel, Sandler explores new depths, portraying a character grappling with loneliness and introspection far removed from his usual comedic fare. This dramatic pivot not only showcases his range as an actor but also brings a fresh perspective to the genre of space dramas.\nFrom Comedy King to Contemplative Cosmonaut\nOver the years, Adam Sandler has cemented his status as a comedy icon, often playing lovable but immature characters. However, his role in 'Spaceman' as Jakub, a man dealing with profound isolation and personal turmoil, marks a significant departure. Sandler's performance is a testament to his ability to convey deep emotional truths, even in the absence of his trademark humor. This shift is not entirely new, as seen in his acclaimed role in 'Uncut Gems', but 'Spaceman' pushes further into the realm of drama, challenging both Sandler and his audience to explore new narrative territories.\nExploring the Human Condition in Outer Space\nThe film's narrative focuses on Jakub's journey, both physical and emotional, as he embarks on a mission to collect a mysterious space dust. However, the true exploration is of Jakub's inner space, his memories, and his relationships, particularly with his wife, Lenka, played by Carey Mulligan. The introduction of Hanus, an extraterrestrial arachnid, adds a fantastical element to the story, serving as a catalyst for Jakub’s introspection. Through these interactions, 'Spaceman' delves into themes of loneliness, love, and the search for meaning, universal experiences that resonate deeply with viewers.\nA Bold Step for Adam Sandler\nTaking on the role of Jakub required Sandler to step out of his comfort zone, not only emotionally but physically, as he portrayed the astronaut's zero-gravity experiences with a blend of vulnerability and restraint. His commitment to the role and the physical demands it entailed signify a bold step in his career, one that may redefine his artistic legacy. While some fans may miss the familiar comedic antics, Sandler’s performance in 'Spaceman' reveals a multifaceted artist capable of evoking a wide spectrum of emotions, proving that there is much more to his craft than meets the eye.\nAdam Sandler's journey from the comedic stages of SNL to the isolated confines of a spacecraft near Jupiter is a testament to his growth as an actor and his willingness to explore complex characters and themes. While 'Spaceman' may depart from the laughs audiences have come to expect, it offers a poignant look at the human condition, with Sandler leading the way through his introspective and nuanced performance. As 'Spaceman' navigates the vastness of space and the intricacies of the human heart, it invites viewers to reflect on their own journeys, making Sandler's latest project a noteworthy addition to his diverse body of work.",

    "text": "I truly believe and fear should Donald J. Trump win the election in November, the Supreme court will be in play. A new round of ignoble judges will sit on the high court to do Trump’s bidding. I fear Social Security, Medicaid, and Voting Rights will be in serious peril, in short, they would be eliminated. Project 2025 envisions big changes across the government, and the role of federal agencies. Project 2025 would eliminate the Department of Commerce, Department of Education, Federal Communications Commission and would eliminate the heart of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of emergency contraception. Project 2025 would advise the president (Donald Trump) to immediately direct the Department of Justice to pursue Donald Trump’s adversaries by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. It has been reported by Axios that the Heritage Foundation has briefed other 2024 Republican presidential candidates on the project. Many of the authors of Project 2025 are members of the first Trump administration and these people are diehard Trump loyalist. Donald Trump’s plans for a second term includes giving the president unchecked power over federal agencies and the ability to bypass the Congress. I will close with a quote from the beloved poet Maya Angelou: “Once you find the truth you ought to be prepared to stand on the street corner and use all your gifts to right the wrong.”—Maya Angelou The ignoble Donald Trump once said, “If you’re a star you can grab a woman by the pussy.” That is the day I became a Never Trumper!

    "title": "What you need to know about Rwanda's new syringe factory",
    "text": "Rwanda’s newly launched syringe factory which focuses on producing syringes for vaccines, has been lauded as a facility that is of significance not only to the country but the region and the continent as well. Inaugurated on Tuesday, April 1, the World Health Organisation (WHO)-prequalified facility has the capacity to produce up to one million syringes daily. It is operated by TKMD Rwanda, a subsidiary of the Chinese company Anhui Tiankang Medical Technology. The syringes it produces are designed to automatically disable after a single use. They will be supplied to UNICEF for vaccination programs across various parts of Africa. Endorsed by the WHO, the syringes are a key component of vaccination campaigns led by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). The advanced safety features of such syringes have proven effective in preventing the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C during treatment processes. In this article, The New Times looks at the significance of the factory. 1. Addressing Africa’s Syringe Shortage Speaking to The New Times, Bo Jinlei, CEO TKMD Rwanda, said that the one million syringes they produce every day may be much more than what the Rwandan market needs. Currently, the syringes manufactured in Rwanda have reached foreign countries including Tanzania, Ethiopian, Malawi and more. It is estimated that Africa needs about 1.2 billion of such syringes every year. TKMD can produce close to 400 million syringes in a year to respond to the need in part. Talking about the factory, the Minister of Health, Dr Sabin Nsanzimana, said it is going to be useful beyond Rwanda, noting that shipments of syringes have already been going to different countries. 2. Dealing with Rwanda and Africa’s vaccination challenges Nsanzimana said that Rwanda previously faced challenges in regards to procurement of critical products, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. He recalled that though the country received many vaccines from foreign nations, the donations of syringes were limited, which created a challenge. He noted that there were scenarios where vaccines would land at the airport, but they could not be used due to lack of syringes. “We couldn't use them because there were no syringes to administer vaccines to the people. We had to wait,” he said. ALSO READ: Rwanda mulls using biometric tech in vaccination programs Noting that this was a problem faced by many countries across the continent since they were relying foreign supply, Nsanzimana said Rwanda’s manufacturing facility will be important in satisfying not only the needs of the country but also for “our brothers and sisters in Africa and beyond.” 3. Advancing Rwanda’s medical regulatory standards The presence of such manufacturing plants, which must undergo various approval processes, plays a crucial role in advancing the Rwanda Food and Drugs Authority (Rwanda FDA) to higher levels of maturity, Nsanzimana hinted. Last year, Rwanda FDA achieved Maturity Level 3 (ML3) for the regulation of medicines and vaccines (non-producing), a significant milestone recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO). ML3 signifies stable, well-functioning, and integrated regulatory systems capable of ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of medical products. The recognition pointed to Rwanda’s commitment to maintaining high standards in public health protection through robust regulatory oversight and demonstrates Rwanda FDA’s capability to effectively regulate and monitor the safety, quality, and efficacy of medicines, vaccines, and medical devices in Rwanda. Dr. Nsanzimana noted that Rwanda FDA’s next target is to attain Maturity Level 4, the highest level in the WHO's Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for medicines and vaccines regulations. “It's our next target, but you can't achieve all these levels of manufacturing if you are not manufacturing. For them (Rwanda FDA) as a regulator, they need also to do this in practice, to have these kinds of factories,” he said. 4. Economic and Social Impact in Rwamagana The facility employs over 100 people, 80 percent of whom are women, enhancing healthcare quality and access. “We are seeing a lot of opportunities for skills, for development, but also for young people to be inspired,” Nsanzimana said. He lauded the facility for contributing to the dreams of young people, their passion, and their ambitions. He referred to the factory as a catalyst for so many changes that are going to bring “a lot of equity in global health. He added that it will change the story of countries’ health programs being hindered due to the lack of such small products like syringes which can be manufactured on the continent.",
