    "text": "Nicolas Maduro described the impending arrival of HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a ‘threat’ to his country. President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "text": "TIJUANA, B.C., 5 de diciembre de 2024.– En el marco del segundo día de trabajos del Encuentro Nacional de Alimentación y Desarrollo Comunitario, organizado por el Sistema Nacional DIF, Eneyda Rocha Ruiz, presidenta del Sistema DIF Sinaloa, participó en la mesa de trabajo: Una nueva era para la alimentación escolar: Estrategia Nacional de Vida Saludable, la cual fue presidida por el secretario de Educación Pública de México, Mario Delgado Carrillo, la titular del Sistema Nacional DIF María del Rocío García Pérez.\nEn un comunicado se informó que durante el desarrollo de los trabajos la Secretaría de Educación Pública, el Sistema Nacional DIF y los 31 Sistemas Estatales DIF firmaron para adherirse para el cumplimiento del compromiso número 30: Las escuelas serán espacios de salud, tiene objetivo trabajar conjuntamente en la implementación de los nuevos lineamientos y acciones de vida saludable, promoviendo una sana alimentación en todas las escuelas del país. Este compromiso forma parte de los 100 compromisos del 2do. Piso de la Transformación que presentó la doctora Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, presidenta de México.\nDurante la Mesa de Trabajo Vida Saludable, Eneyda Rocha destacó el impacto de las iniciativas implementadas por el Sistema DIF Sinaloa bajo la instrucción del gobernador Rubén Rocha Moya y su gobierno con sentido social y humano. Una de las acciones más emblemáticas ha sido la creación de 41 huertos hortícolas escolares en 9 municipios, con la cual no solo se mejora la alimentación, sino que también enseña a las niñas y los niños la importancia de cuidar el medio ambiente, cultivar sus propios alimentos y adoptar hábitos saludables desde temprana edad.\n“Estos huertos son más que espacios de aprendizaje; son una herramienta para construir un futuro más saludable y sostenible para nuestras niñas y niños. En ellos, no solo sembramos verduras, sino también valores como la responsabilidad, el cuidado del entorno y el trabajo en equipo”, señaló la Dra. Rocha.\nCabe destacar que desde el inicio de la administración de Eneyda Rocha Ruiz se han implementado estrategias para atender el cuidado, alimentación y nutrición de niñas y niños desde la primera infancia y, en ese sentido se ha avanzado con el programa como las aulas cocina donde se brinda alimento caliente en escuelas públicas y se abrieron 5 estancias infantiles donde además de cuidados maternos se brinda alimentación a niñas y niños mientras sus padres se encuentran laborando en el campo.\nLa firma de este compromiso representa un paso importante para las familias sinaloenses, asegurando que las niñas y los niños tengan acceso a una alimentación adecuada que impulse su desarrollo físico y cognitivo. Además, refleja el compromiso del gobierno de Sinaloa por trabajar en iniciativas que promuevan el bienestar social y una mejor calidad de vida.\nCon acciones como estas, DIF Sinaloa reafirma que la nutrición infantil es una prioridad, y que juntas y juntos podemos sembrar el futuro que merecen nuestras niñas y niños.",

    "text": "Class of 2024: Rhea Perdue ready to make New York City her stage\nName: Rhea Perdue\nCollege: [College of Architecture, Arts, and Design](https://aad.vt.edu/)\nMajor: [Theatre arts](https://sopa.vt.edu/future-students/undergraduate-programs/Theatre.html)\nHometown: Rich Creek, Virginia\nPlans after graduation: Moving back to New York City at the beginning of 2025 to continue her work as a comedic tour guide on The Ride NYC. While she is working and auditioning for shows, Perdue will be taking classes at the Stella Adler Center for the Arts, an acting conservatory in the city. Her dream is to perform on Broadway.\nFavorite Hokie memory: “Every rehearsal room I’ve ever been in. I’ve been in five shows here, and the rehearsal room is where the magic happens. It is my favorite part of the process.”\nSetting the scene for success\nFrom the second she sat down in her Introduction to Theatre class, Perdue knew she had only one option for her future: acting. She changed her major from journalism to theatre arts the next day.\n“I see myself always acting,” Perdue said. “As cheesy as it sounds, I think I was only supposed to do one thing with my life.”\nSince then, Perdue has made significant contributions to multiple areas of theater at Virginia Tech: performing in five shows, crafting in the costume shop, practicing dramaturgy, and working for the Moss Arts Center as an usher leader. This spring, she received the Samuel Robert Cox Memorial Scholarship, endowed to honor the theatre alumnus.\n“I’m not everybody’s cup of tea, because I’m coffee,” Perdue said. “So this scholarship meant a lot to me because it showed that my professors see me and see how passionately I love this field.”\nAdvancing from understudy to under the spotlight\nAlthough Perdue was assigned only one scene in “Describe the Night,” her first play as a student in the [School of Performing Arts](https://sopa.vt.edu/), she took advantage of the opportunity to study and absorb how the actors worked together.\n“It was such a great formative first experience with college theater,” Perdue said. “I was glued to watching this process come together in a way that I’ve never seen before.”\nHer second play, “H*tler’s Tasters,” was her first experience at being an understudy. She further developed her acting skills in “Concord Floral” and “This is Not a Scam!!” Most recently, Perdue showed off the results of her hard work and took on a major role in the ensemble comedy [“POTUS: Or, Behind Every Great Dumbass are Seven Women Trying to Keep Him Alive.”](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/09/sopa-potus.html)\nLearning from the best\nPerdue credits her opportunities, motivation, and overall growth as an actor to [Susanna Rinehart](https://sopa.vt.edu/faculty_staff/theatre-faculty/susanna-rinehart.html), associate professor of performance and associate dean for academic and faculty affairs, and former faculty member Sarah Yorke. She admires Rinehart’s ability to command a room and values Yorke as a mentor, friend, and director.\n“I just knew that I had to learn from Susanna forever,” Perdue said. “I don’t meet many people that share such a specific love for the background, research, and history of it all. It made me fall back in love with theater.”\nBecause Perdue does not see herself as someone with a lot of natural talent, the dedication of Rinehart and Yorke to their craft influenced her both behind the curtain and on the stage.\n“I have to work really hard,” Perdue said. “The only thing I have natural talent in is Skee-Ball. They took a chance on me, and I am absolutely the actor I am because of them.”\nTaking a ride up north\nAs a Giles County local, Perdue has been living at home and driving to campus every day, saving enough money every month to allow her to live and work in Brooklyn in the summers.\n“I’m from such a small town so community is important to me,” Perdue said. “Being at Virginia Tech and living in New York, I’m able to create these small communities in such a big place.”\nIn New York, Perdue entertains her audience as a comedic tour guide on The Ride NYC, a traveling theater where the streets are the stage. The tour bus winds its way through Midtown Manhattan, while Perdue and her cohost tell jokes and share facts as they pass by other performers sprinkled throughout the city.\nThis Hokie is ready to get the show on the road.\nWritten by Ashley Falat, a junior communications major at Virginia Tech",

    "text": "Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. announced that Cancer Research Communications published positive clinical data from the dose-escalation Phase 1 trial of TPST-1120 in an article titled \"First-in-Human Phase I Trial of TPST-1120, an inhibitor of PPARa, as Monotherapy or in Combination with Nivolumab, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors\". The data showed that TPST-1120 demonstrated clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage, even in PD-1 inhibitor refractory and immune compromised cancers, and was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. These earlier Phase 1 data complement the positive Phase 1b/2 data reported in October 2023 from a global randomized study of TPST-1120 In combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line patients with advanced HCC, which showed clinical superiority of the TPST-1120 arm across multiple study endpoints and relevant biomarker-defined patient subpopulations.\nTPST-1120 Phase 1 Study: In this first-in-human Phase 1 study, 35 patients were treated with escalating doses of TPST-1120 either as monotherapy (20 patients) or in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (15 patients). TPST-1120 was well-tolerated as monotherapy and in combination, with a maximum tolerated dose not identified and predominantly low-grade toxicity. Notwithstanding the late-line stage of these patients and difficult to treat tumor types, clinical benefit was observed as both a monotherapy and combination.2 In monotherapy, a best response of stable disease (SD) was observed in 53% (10/19) of evaluable patients, with 5 of those patients staying on treatment for more than 5 months.\nTumor shrinkage of target lesions on treatment occurred in 21% (4 patients) and a best response of no target lesion growth was seen in 3 additional patients. In the combination therapy cohorts, including patients with heavily pretreated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the objective response rate (ORR) was 23% (3/13, all partial responses, or PRs) across all dose levels and 30% (3/10) at the two highest dose levels of TPST-1120, suggesting dose-responsive anti-cancer activity. These responses included a 50% ORR in patients with RCC (2/4 evaluable) who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, and one patient with heavily pre-treated CCA.\nAnalysis of whole blood specimens revealed changes in expression of PPARa-associated immune genes that were related to TPST-1120 dose levels. Some of these changes were only observed in patients who had partial responses, linking TPST-1120 biological activity to clinical outcome.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",

A suspensão da compra pelo governo no início de agosto, às vésperas de o negócio estimado em 1 bilhão de reais ser concluído, tem como pano de fundo outra delicada questão diplomática: a ocupação da Faixa de Gaza pelas forças armadas de Israel .\nDotado de um canhão de longo alcance capaz de lançar com alta precisão obuses de 155 mm, o veículo blindado comprado pelo Brasil é fabricado pela Elbit Systems, renomada empresa de desenvolvimento de tecnologias de defesa. Utilizado pelo exército de Israel, é uma das armas mais empregadas na ofensiva militar que, segundo a ONU, já provocou a morte de 40 mil palestinos em Gaza. A clara oposição do governo brasileiro ao massacre está na raiz da decisão pela suspensão, pois “tornou complicada essa compra”, como explicou Celso Amorim, assessor especial de Lula para assuntos internacionais, em entrevista à CNN Brasil: “Depois da ação altamente condenável do Hamas, houve genocídio por parte de Israel em relação aos palestinos. A Corte Internacional recomenda não colaborar com Israel nesse aspecto militar. Além disso, é preciso esperar passar essa instabilidade no conflito em Gaza”.\nA posição de Lula sobre a questão é conhecida. “O que o governo de Israel está fazendo com a Palestina não é guerra, é genocídio. Se isso não é genocídio, eu não sei o que é”, disse o presidente durante um evento em fevereiro. Recomendada por Amorim, a suspensão da compra dos blindados israelenses tem a anuência do Itamaraty e a oposição do Ministério da Defesa, daí a convocação da reunião para encaminhar a questão. Como a decisão de Lula pela suspensão é esperada, o principal debate do encontro se dará em torno da proposta, apresentada pelo ministro José Múcio Monteiro, de que as etapas de integração e montagem das peças e equipamentos nos 36 veículos seja realizada em solo brasileiro, na fábrica da empresa AEL, subsidiária da Elbit no Rio Grande do Sul.\nO negócio de 1 bilhão de reais foi sustado por recomendação do ex-chanceler Celso Amorim\nProcurado por CartaCapital para falar sobre o avanço dessa proposta junto ao fabricante e também às Forças Armadas brasileiras, o ministro da Defesa não respondeu até o fechamento desta edição. Em nota, a pasta comunicou que “a Defesa tem interesse em construir uma solução conjunta e que a produção seja praticamente toda no Brasil”. A fabricação dos veículos militares na unidade localizada na Grande Porto Alegre geraria até 400 empregos diretos ou indiretos, segundo estimativas da própria Elbit.\nProfessor de Geopolítica da Escola Superior de Guerra, Ronaldo Carmona considera correta, por diferentes razões, a decisão do governo brasileiro pela suspensão da compra dos blindados: “Primeiro, por uma questão de coerência com a nossa política industrial. O Brasil hoje faz um esforço gigantesco, através da nova indústria, para fomentar a defesa nacional e buscar desenvolver capacidade própria de fornecimento de material de emprego militar para as nossas Forças Armadas. É uma meta substituir a forte dependência que o Brasil tem desse material de países da Otan e de Israel”. A segunda razão é de natureza estratégica: “O Brasil tem uma diferença geopolítica importante em relação à atitude do atual governo de Israel, que tem promovido uma política de deliberado genocídio em relação aos palestinos. Há um absoluto descompasso estratégico entre o que é a visão de Israel e o que é a visão do Brasil como membro dos BRICS e ativo defensor da multipolarização do sistema internacional”.\nCarmona ressalta que o Brasil já teve uma robusta base industrial de defesa, inclusive na área de blindados. “A Engesa fabricava nos anos 1980 um carro de combate chamado Osório, que à época venceu em competições internacionais o principal carro de combate americano.” Não por acaso, acrescenta, a empresa brasileira, fundada em 1958, foi objeto de uma ação geopolítica que acabou por fechar o seu acesso a mercados externos: “Com isso, a Engesa entrou em crise falimentar. À época, o governo optou por ignorá-la, o que foi absolutamente lamentável”. Outras empresas como Avibras e Embraer, diz o especialista, foram grandes conglomerados que o Brasil conseguiu formar no desenvolvimento da sua indústria bélica.\nContratos.

Rezende/Forca Aérea Brasileira\nO setor de Defesa, acrescenta o professor da ESG, tem forte incidência no desenvolvimento tecnológico brasileiro. Além das ações de política industrial, o Brasil desenvolve um programa do Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação, gerenciado pela Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (Finep), para o País ganhar autonomia em tecnologias de defesa: “O projeto busca nacionalizar tecnologias das quais hoje o Brasil é dependente do exterior. Creio que a decisão do governo pela suspensão da compra dos blindados tem relação também com essa busca por recompor a nossa autonomia e capacidade em materiais críticos de defesa”.\nAlguns deputados da base governista se mobilizam para que o governo desista deste e de outros três contratos militares firmados pelas Forças Armadas brasileiras com Israel neste ano. Além dos 36 veículos blindados para reforçar a frota do Exército, a Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) contratou, por 86 milhões de reais e sem licitação, os serviços da Israel Aerospace Industries para manutenção de duas aeronaves não tripuladas do modelo Heron-I. A deputada Fernanda Melchionna, do PSOL, protocolou um pedido de informações sobre esse contrato junto ao Ministério da Defesa. Na mira dos parlamentares há ainda dois outros contratos firmados com a empresa israelense Aeroeletronica International, um para a aquisição de duas aeronaves modelo RQ-900, também fabricadas pela Elbit, e outro para a modernização de cinco aeronaves do modelo E-99M, fabricadas pela Embraer e pertencentes à FAB.\nOra licenciado para concorrer à prefeitura de Maricá, no Rio de Janeiro, o deputado federal Washington Quaquá endereçou ao Ministério das Relações Exteriores um pedido pelo fim das compras militares junto a empresas israelenses: “Israel não tem uma aliança estratégica com o Brasil. É preferível fazer acordos com Itália e França, países próximos do Brasil do ponto de vista militar. No mercado tem a China, a Rússia e mesmo os EUA. Não há razão para o Brasil firmar contratos de compra militar com Israel, que não tem relevância geopolítica para o País”.\nDeputados pedem a suspensão de outros acordos militares com Israel, incluindo a modernização de aeronaves da FAB\nA deputada federal Jandira Feghali, do PCdoB, defende que, “devido à limpeza étnica que acontece em Gaza”, o Brasil cancele acordos militares com Israel: “Acho extremamente positiva e importante para este momento a decisão do governo de não comprar os blindados ou de interromper outras negociações desse tipo. Não é possível que, diante do que está acontecendo com o povo palestino, os países não interrompam relações comerciais com Israel, particularmente nesse campo das armas e da segurança”.\nPara Carlos Zarattini, deputado federal pelo PT, toda compra militar brasileira deve respeitar a estratégia geopolítica do País: “Na prática, Israel rompeu com o Brasil na medida em que declarou persona non grata o nosso presidente legitimamente eleito. O governo de Israel tomou essa posição. Portanto, não é conveniente que o Estado brasileiro faça contratos com empresas israelenses na área de defesa neste momento”. Em segundo lugar, diz o vice-líder do PT na Câmara, provavelmente existirão questionamentos de outras empresas ao processo de compra: “Haverá algum desdobramento do ponto de vista administrativo e até judicial. O processo de compra precisa ser reavaliado por vários órgãos, como a Casa Civil e o Itamaraty, além do próprio Ministério da Defesa”.\nO processo licitatório dos veículos blindados teve como derrotadas empresas de tecnologia militar da China, da França e da República Tcheca. Segundo o Ministério da Defesa, a proposta da Elbit Systems foi “a melhor em termos de condições, preços e tecnologia”. Na entrevista à CNN, Celso Amorim afirmou que “não se trata somente de técnica e preço” e que “o aspecto político e diplomático é muito importante e um componente a ser avaliado”. O ex-chanceler ressaltou não se tratar de algo especificamente contra Israel: “O Brasil reconhece e respeita o Estado de Israel, mas o atual governo israelense tem tido comportamento altamente condenável do ponto de vista militar”. Procurado por CartaCapital, o assessor de assuntos internacionais de Lula preferiu não dar novas declarações sobre o tema.\nCríticos. Feghali e Quaquá cobram coerência entre compras estatais e política externa – Imagem: Bruno Spada/Agência Câmara e Rodrigo Cabral/MCTI\nCarmona avalia que a possibilidade de manter o contrato e fazer a produção dos veículos em território nacional através da subsidiária da Elbit no Brasil “é uma tentativa de minorar o problema”, mas alerta que o caminho mais adequado seria reconstituir a tradição brasileira na indústria de blindados: “Temos iniciativas importantes em todo o País, inclusive associadas ao Polo de Defesa de Santa Maria, que tem forte tradição na área de blindados e pode ser objeto de uma iniciativa de incentivo à recomposição dessa capacidade tradicional da indústria de defesa brasileira”. Mais que a produção de uma subsidiária estrangeira no Brasil, diz o professor, “o melhor caminho para o fortalecimento da política industrial e da autonomia tecnológica nacional na área de defesa é buscar recompor essa capacidade de produção de blindados”.\nQuaquá lembra que os laços com as empresas militares israelenses foram fortalecidos durante o governo Bolsonaro. O petista afirma que desenvolver uma indústria bélica é estratégico para qualquer país, mas, no caso brasileiro, isso deve ser feito com os parceiros certos: “Temos, por exemplo, parceria com os franceses no projeto do submarino nuclear e longa tradição de parceria com os italianos. Podemos e devemos fazer novas e várias parcerias para desenvolver a indústria bélica estratégica no País. Mas não podemos ter relações com Estados que promovem genocídios”. •\nPublicado na edição n° 1325 de CartaCapital , em 28 de agosto de 2024.\nEste texto aparece na edição impressa de CartaCapital sob o título ‘Blindagem furada’",
