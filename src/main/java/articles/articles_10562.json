    "text": "Gov. Mills to lead trip to Norway and Denmark to talk offshore wind Gov. Janet Mills and a group of state officials will travel to Norway and Denmark next week to learn more about offshore wind development in those two countries. During the six-day trip, Mills and her delegation plan to visit floating offshore wind turbines in the North Sea and meet with Norwegian and Danish government officials as well as energy industry representatives. The group plans to speak with Denmark's top minister for climate initiatives and representatives for the operator of that country's electricity grid. According to the governor's office, the delegation will also tour a seaport in Esbjerg, Denmark — which is the country's largest port — to hear how the facility has \"supported responsible growth of offshore wind while supporting its significant fishing industry.\" Mills has said the Gulf of Maine's abundant wind resources offer a \"historic opportunity\" to generate more electricity from renewable sources while creating good-paying jobs. But her efforts to jumpstart an offshore wind industry face stiff opposition from some groups, most notably Maine's powerful lobster industry. Fishermen contend that the floating platforms could bar them from important lobstering grounds. The Mills administration's proposal to locate an offshore wind seaport and manufacturing facility on Sears Island has sharply divided local residents and environmental groups. “Maine is well-positioned to unlock the power of offshore wind to generate clean and affordable homegrown energy, reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, protect our environment, advance our climate goals, and create good-paying jobs in a global industry expected to grow in the coming decades,” Mills said in a statement. \" look forward to learning from Norwegian and Danish leaders about their experiences building a successful offshore wind industry while balancing crucial maritime interests and industries and to promoting Maine, our substantial advantages, and our hardworking people.” Maine recently receive federal approval for a research lease in the Gulf of Maine for up to 12 floating turbines developed by a collaborative that includes researchers at the University of Maine. That project is still subject to additional federal review, however. Maine Public’s Climate Desk is made possible by Androscoggin bank, with additional support from Evergreen Home Performance, Bigelow Laboratory, & Lee Auto Malls.",

    "text": "US against long Israeli campaign in Lebanon as Gaza peace talks resume US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests, with the region awaiting the retaliation Israel has vowed for an Iranian missile barrage on October 1. In Short - Israeli military chief hints at possible end to conflict with Hezbollah - Antony Blinken says Iran should not attack Israel again - Blinken's first visit to Middle East since Yahya Sinwar's death The US does not want a protracted Israeli campaign in Lebanon, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday, as efforts got underway to hold fresh talks over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. A month into Israel's military onslaught against the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests, with the region awaiting the retaliation Israel has vowed for an Iranian missile barrage on October 1. Israel's military chief said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah looked possible but gave few details. US and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare the way for renewed talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal which would also entail the release of hostages in the Palestinian enclave, Qatar and Washington said. Israel said its Mossad intelligence agency head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday to try to restart the talks, and meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar's prime minister. \"The parties will discuss the various options for starting negotiations for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity, against the backdrop of the latest developments,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. An Egyptian security delegation met with a delegation of Hamas leaders in Cairo as part of efforts to resume the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said on Thursday. Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told Lebanese pro-Iranian TV channel Al Mayadeen that there was no change in the group's position. \"The hostages held by the resistance will only return by stopping the aggression and completely withdrawing,\" Hamdan said. Previous attempts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have failed. Blinken, who held talks with Qatar's prime minister, has been on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel's close ally, has expressed hope his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting. Israel unleashed its Lebanon offensive with the declared aim of securing the return home of tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel during a year of cross-border hostilities with Hezbollah. Israel has used airstrikes to pound southern Lebanon, Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, and sent ground forces into areas near the border. Lebanese authorities say the campaign has killed more than 2,500 people and displaced more than 1 million people, spawning a humanitarian crisis. \"As Israel conducts operations to remove the threat to Israel and its people along the border with Lebanon, we have been very clear that this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign,\" Blinken said, speaking in Doha. Blinken said the US was working on a diplomatic deal which would allow civilians on both sides on the border to return to their homes. Later, the head of Israel's military said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looked possible. \"In the north (of Israel), there's a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion. We thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah's senior chain of command,\" Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a video statement. Blinken also said Israel should take steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or Lebanese army troops. Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli strike killed three Lebanese soldiers as they tried to evacuate wounded people from the border village of Yater, the Lebanese army said. There was no comment from the Israeli military. The Lebanese army's deployment into the south, where Hezbollah holds sway, is seen as vital to any diplomatic resolution to the war. 'STORM' OF DESTRUCTION In Paris, a conference convened by France raised $200 million for the Lebanese military and $800 million in humanitarian aid. \"There needs to be a ceasefire in Lebanon. More damage, more victims, more strikes will not enable the end of terrorism or ensure security for everyone,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. He said the conference would support the recruitment of 6,000 Lebanese troops and provide the army with key supplies. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said a ceasefire was in Israel's hands. \"The storm we are currently witnessing...carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values,\" he said. Israeli attacks on Thursday included a strike on a vehicle on a highway from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley - one of Lebanon's busiest roads. A security source said one person was killed. The Israeli military said around 120 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israel. In northern Israel, air raid sirens sounded in Nahariya and explosions could be heard as air defences fired to intercept rockets. Footage showed damage to a car, part of a projectile on the roadside, and a hole in the road where it struck. The Alma Research and Education Center, an Israeli think tank, said 29 civilians have been killed in Israel so far as a result of Hezbollah attacks over the last year. At least 25 Israeli soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon since the start of the ground operation three weeks ago. The Israeli military said on Thursday that five more soldiers were killed and seven wounded there during combat. Hezbollah opened fire on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with its Palestinian allies in Gaza. Israel's Gaza offensive has killed nearly 43,000 people, according to Gaza authorities, and laid waste to the territory. The Hamas-led attack which sparked it killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies. At least 16 Palestinians were killed, including children, and 32 wounded in an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza's Nuseirat camp, its Al-Awda hospital said. The Israeli military said it had hit a Hamas command and control centre housed in a compound formerly used as a school in the Nuseirat area.",

    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Federal prosecutors say the wife and brother-in-law of a high-ranking member of Palm Beach County law enforcement defrauded Medicare out of more than $9 million . If convicted, they could spend up to 55 years in federal prison. Ted Albin and Erin Foley, South Florida twins and owners of a medical billing company, are accused of conspiring with clients to bill insurers for medical equipment their patients didn't need. In addition to the multimillion dollar payout from insurers, investigators say the twins earned kickbacks for helping others commit fraud, too. Foley's husband, Randy Foley, leads the Behavioral Services Division at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office . He was not named in the 14-page indictment and has not been charged with a crime. His wife and brother-and-law were indicted in December after investigators identified the siblings' West Palm Beach company, Grapevine Professional Services Inc., as one of several across the country believed to have exploited the federal insurance program. “Medicare is a valuable taxpayer-funded program, designed to provide affordable health care to people over 65 or with disabilities,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the wake of their arrest. “Not to line the pockets of those who would enrich themselves through fraud.\" ' Spine crime': Patients say Lake Worth-area back doctor did 'fake surgeries,' left them in pain Investigators say a network of medical equipment companies provided the twins with sham prescriptions for durable medical equipment, or DME, between 2018 and 2021. DME includes braces, wheelchairs, oxygen equipment and other medical supplies. The indictment does not name the people who wrote the bogus prescriptions but said Albin and Foley knew of their illegitimate origins and used them to bill insurance companies anyway. The twins owned several medical equipment companies themselves and are accused of funneling their own illegally purchased prescriptions into Grapevine's mix as well. Investigators believe the pair also charged a fee to connect associates who wanted in on the scam with people willing to sign off on the phony prescriptions. Foley, 46, of Loxahatchee and Albin, 46, of Stuart were charged in the Southern District of New York with conspiring to commit, and actually committing, health care fraud and wire fraud, as well as conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Foley's court-appointed defense attorney, Jeffrey Pittell, declined to comment on the allegations Thursday. Albin's attorney, Sean Maher, did not immediately return requests for comment. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Teri Barbera said Capt. Randy Foley is a \"highly respected member of PBSO and is not implicated in these yet-to-be proven allegations.\" She declined to comment further.

    "title": "China protests Modi’s response to Taiwanese President’s congratulatory message",
    "text": "China on Thursday lodged a protest with India against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to a congratulatory message from the Taiwanese President following the Lok Sabha elections.“China has always firmly opposed any form of official interaction between the Taiwan regional authorities and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,” Chinese Foreign Office spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday, indirectly chiding India’s move.“There is only one China in the world. India has made serious political commitments regarding the one-China principle and should be vigilant against the political schemes of the Taiwan authorities and refrain from actions that violate the one-China principle,” Mao said.President of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, was among the leaders who congratulated Modi following BJP-led NDA’s third victory at the elections.“We look forward to enhancing the fast-growing #Taiwan-#India partnership, expanding our collaboration on trade, technology & other sectors to contribute to peace & prosperity in the #IndoPacific,” he wrote on X.Modi replied and thanked Lai for his “warm message”. “I look forward to closer ties as we work towards mutually beneficial economic and technological partnerships,” the Indian prime minister added.Interestingly, the Chinese President is the only P-5 leader who is either yet to call or send a congratulatory message to Modi. The message was delivered by the Chinese envoy to New Delhi.“Congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP and BJP-led NDA on the victory in the Lok Sabha election. Look forward to making joint efforts with the Indian side for a sound and stable China-India relationship, which is in line with the interests and expectations of both countries, the region and the world,” Xu Feihong, China’s ambassador to India, posted on X.However, on Thursday, Xu complained about lack of Chinese cars in the Indian capital. He wrote on X, “So many Japanese, Korean, American and German cars on #Delhi streets! Can’t help but think: should all major car exporting countries be blamed for “overcapacity”? If not, why China’s export of new energy vehicles is labelled “overcapacity”? America is a big exporter of soyabeans, chips, and Boeing planes. Why it’s not “overcapacity”? Isn’t that naked double standards? Trade is about exchange of one’s quality products to make life better for the other side. If that means “overcapacity”, shall we end trade around the world?”",

    "text": "MARLTON, N.J. , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Approximately one million Corewell Health patients are being notified that their Social Security numbers and other confidential information were compromised after one of Corewell Health's vendors, HealthEC, experienced a major data breach. The data breach lawyers at Console & Associates, P.C. are investigating claims on behalf of anyone affected by the HealthEC / Corewell Health breach, hoping to fully inform them of the risks they face in the wake of the breach as well as their legal rights.\nThe sensitive personal data of one million patients has been compromised . As a result, victims' full names, Social Security numbers and health information may be in the hands of criminals, putting victims at a greater risk of identity theft and other frauds.\nOn December 22, 2023 , Corewell Health posted a website notice describing a third-party data breach. Evidently, HealthEC is a health technology company that provides services to Corewell. Due to this relationship, Corewell provides HealthEC with confidential patient information. Corewell notes that the incident stemmed from an unauthorized party gaining access to the computer system of one of its vendors, HealthEC. The website notice also contains a link to a HealthEC data breach letter.\nIn the HealthEC letter, the company explains that, upon detecting a possible cybersecurity incident, HealthEC launched an investigation that confirmed that certain files on its computer network were accessed by an unauthorized party between July 14, 2023 and July 23, 2023 . HealthEC also determined that the unauthorized party may have accessed confidential information belonging to as many as one million Corewell Health patients.\nThe list of sensitive information that was exposed includes:\nNames, Addresses, Dates of Birth, Social Security Numbers, Medical record numbers, Medical information, and Health insurance information. If you receive a data breach notice from HealthEC, you could now be at risk of identity theft—and the devastating financial and legal consequences that go along with it.\nWhat Should You Do if You Receive a HealthEC Data Breach Letter?\nIndividuals who receive a data breach letter from HealthEC should take steps to protect themselves. (See our Guide for Victims of Data Breach for more details at https://www.myinjuryattorney.com/patient-privacy-data-breach-lawyers/if-your-information-has-been-compromised-in-a-data-breach/).\nAdditionally, victims should consider contacting a data breach attorney immediately, as anyone who receives a data breach letter from HealthEC may be entitled to financial compensation.\nIf you wish to discuss this data security incident, please contact Console & Associates, P.C. at (866) 778-5500. You can also learn more about this data breach and potential lawsuit at https://www.myinjuryattorney.com/corewell-health-data-breach-class-action-investigation-and-lawsuit-assistance/.\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and ethical rules.\nCONTACT:\nConsole & Associates\nP.C., 866-778-5500\ninfo@consoleandassociates.com\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/console--associates-pc-corewell-health-reports-third-party-data-breach-at-healthec-exposed-social-security-numbers-of-1-million-patients-302023551.html\nSOURCE Console & Associates, P.C.\nCopyright 2023 PR Newswire",

Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, whose characteristic pathology involves progressive deficiency of dopaminergic neurons and generation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Aggregated and misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) is the major constituent of LBs. As the newly discovered pathway of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) and receptor Mas have attracted increasing attentions for their correlation with PD, but underlying mechanisms remain not fully clear. Based on above, this study established PD models of mice and primary dopaminergic neurons with AAV-hα-syn(A53T), then discussed the effects of Ang-(1-7)/Mas on α-syn level and neuronal apoptosis for these models combined with downstream long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Results showed that Ang-(1-7) alleviated behavioral impairments, rescued dopaminergic neurons loss and lowered α-syn expression in substantia nigra of hα-syn(A53T) overexpressed PD mice. We also discovered that Ang-(1-7) decreased level of α-syn and apoptosis in the hα-syn(A53T) overexpressed dopaminergic neurons through lncRNA NEAT1/miR-153-3p axis. Moreover, miR-153-3p level in peripheral blood is found negatively correlated with that of α-syn. In conclusion, our work not only showed neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanisms for Ang-(1-7) on α-syn in vivo and vitro, but also brought new hope on miR-153-3p and NEAT1 for diagnosis and treatment in PD.",
