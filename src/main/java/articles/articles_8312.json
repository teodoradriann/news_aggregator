    "text": "Bangor Public Works falls behind on road painting BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - Bangor Public Works is running behind on their pavement painting. As paint needs to be reapplied after every winter, Public Works has been working during the dry times. The project was divided between two contractors. One was responsible for line work, covering road lines and and dotted line in the roads. And one covering the stencil work for areas such as arrows and crosswalks. Both have faced challenges with equipment and labor issues over the last few months. And now, painting deadlines are falling behind. ”We’re exploring other options to help them out in terms of getting a second contractor and just to try to get that up. We’re coming up against school, start of school. So of course, we need to have those crosswalks all freshly painted so the students can safely cross streets. And just in general, I mean Aug. 1th is the is the deadline for all our stenciling, and we’re, at this point, Aug. 13th, or 14th, today? And I think we’re at about 34% of all, stencils, have been completed, which is, which is quite low,” said Aaron Huotari, director of Bangor Public Works. Huotari added that they expect the long-line painting to be completed this week. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Las fuerzas israelíes hicieron estallar 11 casas en la zona residencial de al Hawaja, dentro del campamento de refugiados de Yabalia, provocando una \"gran masacre\", indicó la Defensa Civil de [Gaza](https://rpp.pe/mundo/medio-oriente/eeuu-dice-a-israel-que-llego-el-momento-de-terminar-la-guerra-en-gaza-noticia-1593495), que alertó que el Ejército hebreo \"mantiene bajo asedio los principales hospitales y ataca directamente las ambulancias y equipos de rescate\". Las autoridades gazatíes estiman que una nueva tanda de ataques de Israel en el campo de refugiados de Yabalia, norte de la Franja de Gaza, ha causado unos 150 muertos, aunque los servicios de rescate no han podido acceder a la zona ante el asedio de las tropas israelíes. \"Una horrible masacre está ocurriendo actualmente en el área de la calle Al-Hawaja, en Yabalia, con informes de más de 150 mártires, heridos y no hay nadie que intervenga para salvarlos\", indicó el portavoz de la Defensa Civil de Gaza, Mahmud Basal. Las fuerzas israelíes hicieron estallar 11 casas en la zona residencial de al Hawaja, dentro del campamento de refugiados de Yabalia, provocando una \"gran masacre\", indicó la Defensa Civil, que recibió numerosas llamadas de socorro. \"Los ciudadanos se enfrentan a grandes dificultades para transportar a los muertos y heridos debido a la interrupción por parte de la ocupación israelí de los servicios médicos de emergencia y de la Defensa Civil en el norte de la Franja de Gaza\", señaló Basal. De confirmarse estas cifras, se trataría de [una de las mayores matanzas de la guerra en la Franja de Gaza](https://rpp.pe/mundo/medio-oriente/nueva-masacre-de-israel-en-gaza-al-menos-90-muertos-deja-un-ataque-del-ejercito-hebreo-a-una-escuela-noticia-1575599), después de que unos 270 palestinos murieran el pasado junio en Nuseirat, durante una operación de rescate de rehenes, en la que el Ejército sacó con vida a cuatro cautivos israelíes entre duros enfrentamientos armados con Hamás, cobrándose la vida de un alto número de civiles. Ejército israelí “ataca directamente las ambulancias y equipos de rescate” La Defensa Civil de la Franja de Gaza alertó la madrugada del jueves de que los servicios médicos de emergencia se han suspendido en toda la gobernación del norte ante la dura ofensiva israelí, que \"mantiene bajo asedio los principales hospitales y ataca directamente las ambulancias y equipos de rescate\", desde hace veinte días. El hospital Indonesio, Beit Lahia, está cerrado por los ataques israelíes, mientras que el Kamal Adwan, en la misma ciudad, y el Al Awda, dentro del campo de refugiados de Yabalia, funcionan a duras penas y al borde del colapso, ante el asedio israelí que hoy cumple 20 días con un saldo de 770 muertos, según el gobierno gazatí. Israel asegura haber \"eliminado\" a más de 200 supuestos combatientes en su nueva ofensiva en el norte del enclave. Con el argumento de que era un centro de comando de Hamás, el Ejército israelí también atacó la tarde del jueves una escuela que albergaba desplazados en el campo de refugiados de Nuseirat, en el centro de la Franja, causando 17 muertos, la mitad niños incluido uno de 11 meses, y 52 heridos.

    "title": "Defensive Player of the Year: Woods leaves mark on Walton defense",
    "text": "Walton linebacker Ashton Woods said he always got nervous before games. He said he never wanted to get comfortable, because if he did, that’s when the opponent could, too. Well, it was obvious the pregame butterflies were flying all year this season. Woods led a defense that allowed only 16.5 points per game, went 14-1, had an undefeated regular season, won the Region 5 title and made it all the way to the state championship game. Woods himself finished the year with 152 tackles, 20 tackles for loss, eight sacks and two interceptions. He earned Region 5 Defensive Player of the Year honors, was named all-State by the Touchdown Club of Atlanta and Recruit Georgia and to cap it off, he is the All-Cobb County Defensive Player of the Year as selected by the Cobb County coaches. After averaging 15 tackles a game, it may be hard to imagine the gaudy numbers the North Carolina-signee may have put up if he had played in the second half of games. In at least eight games, he was off the field either at halftime, or early in the third quarter. It was in those early moments of the third quarters where Woods said he started hearing messages from the opponents that told him exactly how good his team was. “They started congratulating us,” he said. “They said they were just trying to get the game over with.” Woods has been a consistent contributor since his freshman year. His junior season he finished with 128 tackles and five sacks but over the last season, he helped turn himself into the four-star recruit with extensive study. “On the field I was learning the game more,” he said. “I got more downfield and understood the numbers better. I also became more of a leader. I liked coaching up the younger linebackers to make sure they are ready to take over.” Woods said practicing against the Walton offense everyday made him and the defense better, and that was reciprocated by the Raiders’ quarterback, Jeremy Hecklinski. “I’ve seen Ashton on defensive side of the ball for the last four years,” Hecklinski said. “He’s made me a lot better.” However, there is also seems to be a friendly rivalry between the two. “I kind of figured him out,” Hecklinski said. “I liked to mess with him during practice.” The duo will continue the rivalry in the ACC when Woods’ Tar Heels take on Hecklinski’s Wake Forest Deamon Deacons. Woods said there is one specific game that stands out from the 2023 season, and he added that it helped the team make the final jump it needed to be prepared for the postseason — the region opener against North Cobb. The Warriors jumped out to a 21-0 lead, but the Raiders found a way to tie the game in the second quarter, and then went on to win it. “That game made us a million times better,” Woods said. “It showed us we had a lot of heart.”",

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The cold is creeping in, but there are a few things you can do to keep it out. [CenterPoint Energy](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1710) says for the next few days, you may want to be mindful of the thermostat. \"With colder weather, and especially since that's happening across the country, customers need more natural gas to keep their homes safe and warm,\" said Joshua Solis, lead communication specialist for CenterPoint Energy Minnesota. \"We want to encourage customers to reduce their thermostat to about 65 degrees when they're at home during the day, and then reduce that an additional five degrees at night or when they're away for an extended period of time.\" On top of that, energy companies recommend keeping your exterior doors shut and bolted, but keeping interior doors open to help with airflow. Solis recommends turning your ceiling fans on and rotating them slowly, which circulates the warm air. During the day you want to keep your drapes and blinds open to maximize heat from the sun, and at night you want to keep them closed so you can retain heat. Experts also recommend checking on your furnace filter. You can drip your faucets, keep cabinet doors open, and cover hose bibs to protect pipes. \"Traditionally, the wholesale prices of natural gas have been pretty affordable, they are starting to go up a little bit right now with this cold spike,\" said John Marshall, the regional vice president of Xcel Energy. \"Typically in the winter season, your heating bills really account for half your total energy bill. So we do encourage folks to be prudent with their thermostats.\" [Xcel Energy](https://stories.xcelenergy.com/ArticlePage/?id=Xcel-Energy-shares-energy-saving-tips-as-colder-weather-looms) also wants to remind residents to keep their natural gas meters clear, avoiding a dangerous buildup of pressure in gas lines and leaks.

    "text": "A tale of two misplaced pups in Northampton County is looking to have a happy ending. Police say the strays are set to be adopted on Thursday afternoon. But it highlights a larger problem of overrun shelters in the area.\nTwo male pit mixes have landed behind bars. Colonial Regional Police took the dogs into custody, after passersby found them roaming off Route 33 a little more than a week ago.\n\"Several times a year we get strays that we have to take in,\" Lt. Darrin Wendling, with the Colonial Regional Police Department, said.\nPennsylvania law requires police to take them in, Wendling says, but only for 48 hours. Still, the officers don't like to give up on these animals so easily. Wendling says the shelters have been great to work with, but the past couple years, it's been harder to find room in them.\n\"Unfortunately, the shelters and rescues are all full,\" Wendling said. \"And we've tried in Northampton, Monroe, Lehigh, multiple counties around us.\"\nThe shelters that 69 News reached out to say they are constantly full.\nLehigh Valley Humane Society says it's been at or over capacity for the last seven months.\n\"All shelters right now are bursting at the seams,\" Janet Dorwart, with Peaceable Kingdom in Whitehall, said.\nDorwart serves as the shelter's dog program liaison. She explains why the problem is getting worse in recent years.\n\"There are a lot of posts on Facebook about, 'found this dog,' 'found this cat,' 'is this your dog,' 'is this your cat,'\" she said. \"And unfortunately, most of those are abandoned pets.\"\nDorwart says even when the shelter is full, sometimes the workers have no choice but to squeeze another animal into their care.\n\"We said 'well, we're full, we're really sorry,'\" she said. \"And they said, 'well, we'll just take her down and tire to a pole in the park.'\"\nLieut. Wendling says he believes the two dogs at the police station have also been abandoned.\n\"The last chip addressed to the owner was in New York City,\" Wendling said. \"We can no longer locate any type of owner, or anybody that has any information on the dog.\"\nPolice say this time, a couple is stepping in to adopt the pups. A happy ending? Hopefully.\n\"We don't have the personnel to go out and actually vet residents,\" Wendling said.\nSince police are not actual animal shelters, they're not equipped to do what shelters do, to ensure all animals make it into safe, loving homes. Still, they do what they can.\n\"So, just by talking to people,\" he said. \"They know what they're really getting into, making sure they're prepared for it and making sure that they're actually taking the dog for the right reasons.\"\nMeanwhile, Dorwart wants to remind all prospective pet owners, if you can:\n\"Adopt don't shop.\"\nScroll down for comments if available\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "text": "Santo Domingo, RD.- La Universidad Nacional Evangélica (UNEV) otorgó este jueves el «Galardón a la Reforma» al recién alcalde electo de Santo Domingo Este, el pastor [Dío Astacio ](https://www.elcaribe.com.do/panorama/politica/dio-astacio-anuncia-jornada-de-limpieza-y-retiro-de-su-publicidad-en-sde/)durante la primera investidura del 2024 en la que graduó 752 nuevos profesionales. Tras ser condecorado, el político y líder cristiano agradeció el reconocimiento y expresó que la mayoría de las personas se preparan para conseguir un buen trabajo, por lo que exhortó a esta generación de profesionales a prepararse mentalmente para triunfar, no para un trabajo. “Trabajar no es lo que va a llevarlos al éxito, lo que los llevará al éxito es su deseo de triunfar, porque hay gente, y es la mayoría, que solo trabajan para comer, para vivir, pero ellos no han considerado jamás que el éxito no es una casualidad, sino que es una declaración”, manifestó [Dío Astacio.](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADo_Astacio) De su lado, el presidente del Consejo Académico de la Alta Casa de estudios, el rector, Juan Guerrero Ávila, indicó que este reconocimiento se otorga en virtud de su destacada labor y compromiso con la implementación de reformas trascendentales en beneficio de la comunidad, reflejando su dedicación incansable hacia el progreso y la mejora continua.",

    "text": "▲土城謝男殺妻、小姨子，遭押上車帶回土城分局。（圖／記者陳以昇翻攝）\n記者洪巧藍／台北報導\n新北市土城46歲謝姓男子違反保護令遭捕，在檢方無保飭回後開車衝撞、刺殺妻子和小姨子震驚社會，也引發保護令無用等議論。衛福部保護司司長張秀鴛今（9）日表示，下周一將跨部會會議討論本案，初步審視社工檢警在各個處理環節皆有達成，僅有「無保飭回」部分還要了解，將研擬「致命危險清單」提供檢察官，做為評估是否羈押參考。\n張秀鴛今日受訪證實，衛福部、司法警政、內政部等中央單位每3個月召開家暴性侵害推動小組，下周一將請新北網絡報告本案，再來檢視相關制度、環節是否有可以調整之處。\n張秀鴛說明，目前掌握整起案件，第一線處理警方已有警覺加害人危險、暴力傾向，移送地檢署，加害人無保飭回後，檢察官有依照流程通知警察機關與家防中心，被害人知曉情況，社工也與其討論相關安全計劃，從法院審理保護令結束到回到家，走哪一條路都有安排，然而卻在兩姐妹再出門時發生狀況。\n張秀鴛說，審視整起不幸事件，包含檢警、社工處理、法院核發保護令各方面，速度也都相當的快，可以精進空間不大，唯一遺憾之處就是加害人被逮捕後沒有羈押或責付條件。也因此，希望從過去案件搜集可能危險因子，訂出「致命危險清單」，提供警方、檢察官到法官評估是否可以交保的參考，讓保護程度再拉高。\n張秀鴛直言，保護令確實不是萬靈丹，僅是一紙法律命令，若加害人執意違法，仍難完全避免悲劇，所以整體保護網絡從警察、社工、檢察官到法院每一環節都必須保持警覺，共同預防危險行為發生。而國內1年開出2萬多件保護令，實務面來看約有8成有發揮保護效果，希望外界不要因為另2成未達保護功能，就懷疑整體的保護作用。",
