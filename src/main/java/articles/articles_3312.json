    "title": "Stop blaming God for your woes",
    "text": "Realised souls would rather blame themselves for their faulty deeds It is a faulty instinct. Let us understand what happens. We are suddenly hit by some trouble or are faced with a problem. Why did it happen to me? I was trying to live a normal life, not harming anyone. Why this punishment? We think like this. However, our thinking is faulty because we are unable to see the big picture. What is the big picture? It is to see any situation in its totality. We get punished because punishment has become due to bad acts done earlier. These could be even from past lives, which have come to fruition now. An understanding of the ‘Karmaphala Principle’ is required. We are forever doing acts with our bodies, minds and words. They all result in phalas, i.e. good and bad fruits. And their period and type of rewards and punishments are determined by divine authority under the superintendence of God, (The Bhagavad-Geeta 9.10), who has set the rules for such implementation. Essentially, they are based on dharma (sound moral principles) and justice. Whatever happens to us is essentially due to our good and bad acts. There is another factor in our woes. This earth planet is a place of misery (dukhalaya – 8.15), which has three types of pains. They are: what we give ourselves, what others give us and what the material nature gives like excess heat, cold, etc. However, the Earth's planet is not like a concentration camp. With proper behaviour, one can enjoy unlimited ‘sukha’ (happiness) also. (5.21) The next question is: why did we not qualify for better planets like Heaven or even Vaikuntha? The answer is the same: our acts with our bodies, minds and words did not make us deserving of them. However, the Earth's planet is very special for one reason. God pays special attention to it; He even incarnates here. (4.7) When we do good, pious acts, we get rewarded at some time in the future. It has to be paid first and again later. < This is the way it must be. There cannot be fun now and fun later also. If we wish better life, and fewer problems and troubles, we must begin taking active shelter from God. The first requirement is to follow dharma, which is very dear to God. The next requirement is to do all duties, i.e. according to time, place and circumstances. (3.8) There is no escape from there because that is the only right given to us. (2.47) Not doing them is dereliction and punishable. Additionally, we must serve others, because this is how the creation can exist. Imagine a day in our lives. How many must contribute to help us exist? The next level is spiritual when we recognize the existence of God and begin praying to Him for whatever we need. We have four main requirements. (7.14) The first one is our material necessities. The next one is help in getting out of trouble. The third one follows; we desire to know more about God. This is when our spiritual journey takes off and ends in becoming knowledgeable about God. In this period, one will do many spiritual acts suiting one’s natural circumstances, etc. Gradually, one will take shelter of God and will remain under it. By now, one would have realised that everything is logical. There is nothing like chance; we reap what we sow. Realised souls do not ever blame God for their woes. Rather they blame themselves for their faulty deeds done earlier. This helps them in two ways. They become careful about what they do now because they are aware that bad acts will surely bring punishment later. And they remain in shelter of God thus safeguarding themselves against future troubles hoping to be bailed out by God (18.58) And God does, as He is very merciful.

    "title": "STUDY: Ultra-low-dose ketamine can curb opioid withdrawal",
    "text": "In a study, ketamine helped some patients complete buprenorphine treatment and overcome their fentanyl addiction. Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury deaths in young adults in the United States, with fentanyl causing over 70,000 deaths annually. Many people who use fentanyl become trapped in their addiction out of fear and a low tolerance for the withdrawal symptoms, which include muscle cramps, nausea, chills, sweats and intense cravings. They can’t stop using fentanyl, and they also have trouble starting either of the two medications, methadone and buprenorphine, that can dramatically reduce their risk of overdose death. Research findings published Aug. 29 in Addiction Science & Clinical Practice may offer hope. A pilot study showed that a small amount of ketamine can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting fentanyl. “The main takeaway is that we have found an easier way for people trapped in the grip of fentanyl addiction to get started in treatment,” said Dr. Lucinda Grande, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine. She was the study’s lead author. “Methadone can be difficult to access due to strict federal regulations, and starting buprenorphine can cause severe withdrawal symptoms before those who start it become stabilized,” added study co-author Dr. Tom Hutch. He is the medical director of the opioid treatment program at We Care Daily Clinics in Auburn, Wash. “Ketamine, at an imperceptibly low dose, helps bridge that gap.” Over 14 months, Grande and colleagues in Auburn and Olympia prescribed ketamine to 37 fentanyl-addicted patients whose fear of withdrawal symptoms had deterred them from trying buprenorphine. Twenty-four patients actually tried the drug, and 16 completed the transition to buprenorphine. Most patients reported a reduction or elimination of withdrawal symptoms after each ketamine dose, the effect of which lasted for hours. Of the last 12 who completed the transition, 92% remained in treatment for at least 30 days. Patients placed a ketamine lozenge or syrup under the tongue. The 16 mg dose is a small fraction of that typically used for anesthesia, the main clinical role of ketamine for 50 years, according to Grande. That dosage also is less than half of the smallest ketamine dose prescribed for depression treatment, an increasingly common use of this medication. Researchers monitored patients daily or almost daily, and refined the treatment strategy based on patient response and prescriber experience. Grande developed the concept after she learned that emergency-medicine physician and coauthor Dr. Andrew Herring of Oakland, California, used a higher, sedating dose of ketamine successfully in his emergency department to resolve a patient’s severe case of withdrawal from fentanyl addiction. Grande is a primary-care and addiction doctor in practice near Olympia who, in the past dozen years, has used low-dose ketamine to treat more than 600 patients for chronic pain and depression. Ketamine has gained prominence in the news since actor Matthew Perry of the sitcom “Friends” overdosed on the drug and drowned. Perry had undergone high-dose ketamine treatment for depression, news reports have suggested. “Our study underscores the enormous potential of this medication for addressing important health problems such as depression, chronic pain and now fentanyl-use disorder,” said Grande. Ketamine’s positive attributes have been overshadowed by Perry’s death, she said. Grande hopes this pilot study’s results will be confirmed by larger studies. “I am excited about these results,” she said. “This is a wonderful opportunity to save lives.” For details about UW Medicine, please visit [uwmedicine.org/about](http://uwmedicine.org/about).",

    "text": "反击AI论文！arXiv每年拒掉2%造假内容，自动化工具加入审核\n（来源：量子位）\nAI生成论文泛滥成灾，arXiv平台看不下去了——\n紧急升级审核机制，用自动化工具来检测AI生成内容。\nNature最新发现，原来每年竟然都有2%的论文会因为AI使用被拒？！\n比如像，bioRxiv和medRxiv每天都要拒绝十多篇公式化AI手稿，每个月就高达7000多份。\n本来是方便快速分享成果的预印本平台，现已成为了AI内容的温床。\n一方面AI写作泛滥成灾，另一方面又要确保不会误伤到合理的AI英语润色需求。\n两难之间，预印本平台也是出手整顿了…….\n不过这件事还得从一篇离谱的预印本论文说起。\n这篇论文题目名为“自我实验报告：梦境中生成式人工智能界面的出现”，7月发表在PsyArXiv上。\n乍一看好像没什么问题，直到“不幸”被一名心理学家点开了文档。\n嚯好家伙，整篇论文只有短短几页，署名还只有作者Jiazheng Liu一个人，也没有注明隶属机构。\n再仔细看看内容呢，所描述的AI实验更是脱离实际，基本可以盖棺定论用了AI。\n由于没有明确声明AI的使用情况，PsyArxiv也是立即下架删除了这篇论文。\n结果没过多久，由于预印本审核不严，该作者再次在PsyArxiv上传了标题和摘要几乎一模一样的预印本。\n另外作者还向Nature附了一封邮件，邮件内容表示AI在该论文生成中发挥作用有限，只用于数学推导、符号计算、组装和应用现有数学工具、公式验证以及另外八项任务。\n他称自己是常驻中国的独立研究人员，没有高等教育学位，唯一的工具还是台二手智能手机……当然，现在第二个版本也已被删除。\n不过这也只是众多AI生成论文中的其中一篇，据arXiv估计，每年都有约2%的论文，因为涉及AI和专门批量造假学术论文的论文工厂，而被平台拒之门外。\n尤其是在ChatGPT推出后，这一比例还出现了大幅度增长的情况，LLM生成了arXiv上22%的计算机科学摘要以及约10%的bioRxiv生物学摘要。\n在一些发表在生物医学期刊的摘要中，AI生成也达到了14%。\nPsyArXiv也对此发表了声明，明确表示涉及AI生成的论文内容有所增加，对于他们这类降低研究共享门槛的非盈利组织而言，越来越多诸如此类的内容，只会让读者削弱对平台共享内容的信任程度。\n筛选低质量的内容需要资源支持，且会降低论文提交后的处理速度，这与预印本平台致力于让科学家们更容易发表工作的初心相悖。\n而与此同时，AI幻觉导致的虚假预印本也会带来错误信息，误导从事相关工作的科研人员。\n如何能够在保持快速审核的同时，确保质量水平，现已成为预印本平台共同的挑战。\n要知道，AI论文生成并不能全盘否定，许多研究人员会使用AI工具来提高清晰度或者总结数据，尤其是对于一些英语非母语的作者，他们需要AI协助完成润色工作。\n这是相当合理的行为，并不存在论文欺诈，真正值得担心的是那些完全由AI捏造方法、结果的论文内容。\n但二者之间其实相当难以区分，一些预印本平台，如PsyArXiv，会直接撤下被标记为内容存疑的论文，但还有一些平台考虑到可能会误伤，所以虽然也会将内容标记为“已撤回”，但在没有明确法律要求的情况下，不会直接进行删除。\n不过他们也没有坐以待毙，现在会使用各种自动化工具和人工筛选程序来捕捉此类可疑内容，如Research Square;)正在使用一款名为Geppetto的工具来检测人工智能生成文本的痕迹。\narXiv也在试图提高综述性论文的发表标准，因为这类论文往往投稿数量巨大，且很多都是AI生成，这样做的目的就是为了丰富个人履历。\n一直依赖人工筛选的openRxiv，现在也在寻求自动化工具使用，以进一步识别AI生成内容的特征。\n当前预印本平台们都正在加急采取一系列反制措施，包括检查异常用户行为、在投稿流程中增设步骤、调整内容公开可见的方式或时间，以阻止低质量内容进入平台。\n但这无异于隔靴搔痒，预印本平台在反击的同时，AI也在不断发展。\n更有甚者，一些作者为了规避被自动化工具抓住AI使用痕迹，会在论文里加入提示词，试图欺骗自动评审。\n也有专业的编辑表示，这对于预印本平台来说相当可怕，因为预印本其实本质还是未经人工审查的。\n所以当未来AI发展到，虚假与真实内容之间已经完全无法区分的时候，预印本平台又将如何应对呢？\n参考链接：\n[1]https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02469-y\n[2]https://www.cos.io/blog/evaluating-ai-impact-on-open-research-infrastructure",

    "title": "USA: Call for Prison Sentence for Individual Who Decapitated Sculpture of Satan",
    "text": "(ZENIT News / Iowa, 27.12.2023).- Michael Cassidy, a Christian and former military officer pushed the statue of Baphomet from the Satanic scene erected in the Capitol of the State of Iowa, and decapitated the statue of the satanic image. He was arrested and charged with “fourth degree felony,” according to Iowa’s Public Security Department. The statue was part of the scene set up, with official authorization, in the Capitol of the State of Iowa. The decapitated head was thrown into the garbage. Cassidy destroyed the statue to “wake up Christians to the anti-Christian acts promoted by our government.” He also said that the existence of the “satanic scene” was a provocative sample during Christmas. It was set up by the Satanic Temple’s Association, which has been recognized legally since 2013 as a religious organization. Strangely, the Association says it doesn’t believe in God or in the devil or in supernatural beings. It uses symbolisms and themes that annoy Christians, such as the diabolic, abortion and blasphemy, described as expressions of freedom. This representation was coloured during Christmas in red and black, with black candles and a figure with a goat’s head and beard called Baphomet, one of Satan’s names. The networks published messages wishing “Happy Saturnalia and Yule for all.” Michael Cassidy, 35, former pilot of the U.S. Navy and civil test pilot, destroyed the controversial montage, which was criticized by many. His action was described as a minor felony, but he faces a year in prison and a US$2,560 fine. He asked for financial support on the Internet to cover the fine and his defense in court. In just one night, he collected US$40,000, which three days later rose to US$75,000. “My conscience is at the service of the Word of God, not of bureaucratic decrees. So I acted,” he said. He will give the money leftover from legal expenses to “a Christian legal fund.” Cassidy also said: “My most profound hope is that Americans of all political persuasions can unite and be in agreement that: one, Jesus Christ is Lord; two, that Satan is the Evil One.” And he stressed the limits of freedom of expressions when it comes to the honour of God: ”To Christians that defend satanic altars when they talk with their friends, relatives, in their church, to colleagues or on X . . . would you use the same argument if you were talking with God?” Referring to satanists, he said they defend “profoundly held beliefs” and “reject arbitrary authority (. . .). The world can tell Christians to accept submissively Satan’s legitimacy, but none of the Founding Fathers would have considered that the Government’s sanction to satanic altars inside Capitol buildings would be protected by the First Amendment . . . . Anti-Christian values have spread constantly over the last decades, and Christians have behaved as the proverbial frog in boiling water.” The police arrested Cassidy after he handed himself over to the officers in the building. Iowa’s Satanic Temple, author of the scene in the State Capitol intends to file a complaint for fourth degree damages. ”I saw this blasphemous statue and I was indignant,” said Cassidy",

    "title": "La trama en el error de la Secom en la cuenta pública que terminó con los ministros indignados y una renuncia",
    "text": "La Tercera Los ministros del comité político estaban indignados, y así se lo transmitieron a sus equipos. El sábado, apenas había comenzado la cuenta pública del Presidente Gabriel Boric, un link empezó a circular entre los parlamentarios de oposición: https://www.gob.cl/cuentapublica2024/. En la página se encontraba el listado de los principales anuncios del Mandatario -incluido el ingreso del proyecto de ley sobre aborto legal-, pero su difusión anticipada no estaba contemplada en el diseño de La Moneda, debido al sigilo con el que habían llevado el tema. El malestar del gabinete -que se extendió hasta los días siguientes en reuniones- era evidente. Varios de ellos pidieron explicaciones y manifestaron su disconformidad. Y es que la conclusión de los secretarios de Estado fue que la difusión de la página web opacó el desarrollo de las palabras de Boric. Esto, porque apenas se publicó el link se empezaron a esparcir las principales claves del texto antes de que fueran mencionadas por Boric, y los parlamentarios de oposición comenzaron a reaccionar. Por lo mismo, la histeria se apoderó rápidamente de los equipos de la Secretaría de Comunicaciones (Secom), encabezada por Pablo Paredes (Revolución Democrática), de quienes depende la administración de la web. En ese minuto la jefa del departamento digital de la Secom, Nicole Otazo, recibió la instrucción de retroceder y borrar la información con los detalles del discurso. Pero ya era tarde: el contenido estaba en los medios de comunicación y varios de los parlamentarios estaban más atentos a sus celulares que a las palabras del Presidente. En el Ejecutivo, eso sí, existen dos versiones respecto a quién dio la orden original de publicar el link. Hay quienes apuntan a que fue el propio Paredes, mientras que otros indican que fue una decisión de Otazo. Las disculpas de Crispi, la furia de la DC y el desaire de Campillai: lo que no se vio de la tercera cuenta pública de Boric Lo cierto es que ese momento, dicen en La Moneda, fue muy tenso para quienes seguían las palabras del Mandatario en el Palacio Presidencial, ya que los equipos de los ministros pedían explicaciones ante la difusión anticipada de la información. El enredo llegó a tal punto que la salida de Otazo se definió, según publicó El Mostrador, poco después de que terminó la cuenta pública. La frenteamplista fue jefa de comunicación digital en primera vuelta de la campaña presidencial de Boric, luego integró el equipo durante el balotaje y, posteriormente, pasó directo a la jefatura digital de la Secom. Ahí hay versiones encontradas: mientras en los equipos de la Secom transmiten que ella presentó su renuncia, otras fuentes del gobierno aseguran que fue despedida por el error, lo que produjo el malestar entre quienes la conocen por su trabajo en la campaña presidencial. Lo cierto es que hay quienes en el oficialismo transmiten que se cortó “por lo más bajo” en las responsabilidades, ya que Paredes salió invicto. De hecho, la exjefa de comunicaciones de Boric, Tatiana Klima, cuestionó el episodio. “Me da mucha pena que Nicole haya sido desvinculada”, dijo en Mesa Central de Canal 13, donde es panelista. En esa línea, sostuvo que “el departamento digital funciona históricamente bajo la línea directa o un director. Yo no tengo dudas del profesionalismo de la Nicole, y la minuta, que eran las 61 medidas, la recibí antes que se publicara y se bajara en la página web no por la Secom, andaba dando vuelta”. “Los hilos se cortan por lo más delgado. Me atrevo a decirlo porque es una mala costumbre”, remató.",
