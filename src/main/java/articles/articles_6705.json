    "text": "The Norfolk Tides emphatically ended a five-game losing streak, zooming past Lehigh Valley 14-8 Saturday night before 10,100 at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nThree Tides who have briefly appeared this year for the Baltimore Orioles drove in four runs apiece: Connor Norby, Heston Kjerstad and Kyle Stowers. Norby scored three runs and belted a three-run homer in the sixth. Kjerstad and Stowers each homered among two hits and scored twice.\nBilly Cook and Maverick Handley added two hits each among Norfolk’s 12.\nThe night’s biggest drawback for Baltimore fans was the ineffectiveness of Dean Kremer, who was making a rehabilitation start. He gave up five earned runs, five hits and a walk and got just two outs with his 39 pitches.\nTucker Davidson pitched five innings for the win and struck out five, though he gave up three runs and three hits. Fellow Norfolk relievers Nolan Hoffman (2 1/3 innings) and Morgan McSweeney (one inning) gave up a hit each but no runs.\nThe IronPigs (33-39) still have a 4-1 lead in the six-game series, which concludes with a 1:35 p.m. Sunday contest.\nThe Tides’ bullpen had coughed up leads in the previous two games, but Norfolk (36-38) scored 12 consecutive runs to build a virtually insurmountable 14-5 edge before yielding three runs in the eighth inning.\nKody Clemens and Ruben Cardenas hit home runs for Lehigh Valley, Philadelphia’s top affiliate. Scott Kingery was ejected in the seventh inning.",

    "text": "Heavy snow expected Friday morning If you were waiting to believe it until you saw it, then you better believe it now! Steady snow is currently falling across all of southeast Wisconsin Friday morning. Most locations have already picked up an inch or two of snowfall. The heaviest snow is just starting to get organized. Check out a current radar image that will update with time below: There is no change to the winter weather advisory that was issued Thursday. That advisory is still in effect until Friday afternoon for the likelihood of over 3\" of snow for all of southeast Wisconsin. The high end of snow totals has come down a bit from Thursday and the axis of heavy snow has shifted farther south. It still looks likely that parts of southeast Wisconsin will see over 5\" of snowfall with this system and the best chance for that is from West Bend and Port Washington to Lake Geneva and Racine. Northern counties likely end up with a little less with 2-5\" in those areas. Even though a few inches of snow is likely for all of southeast Wisconsin, that snow will be a little slower to accumulate on the roads. Most of the main roads are pretty slushy right now. Even so, drive times are already very slow for the early morning commute and some of the DOT cameras are showing snow covered roads. You can see winter road conditions update with time here: Make sure to download the CBS 58 Ready Weather app to track the snowfall all day.",

Le préfet appelle les habitants mal-logés à se rendre dans les centres d'hébergement du département.\nL'archipel de Mayotte sera placé en alerte rouge cyclonique ce vendredi à 22h (20h à Paris) en raison du passage du cyclone Chido, a annoncé le préfet de ce département français dans l'océan Indien. « C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h », a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse.\nLe préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, « seront ouverts à tous », a-t-il assuré.\nRafales, pluies intenses et vagues submersives\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un « cyclone tropical intense » explique Météo-France, qui prévoit « de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer ». Ces conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent « un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral » a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à « impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme ».\nAéroport et écoles fermés\nToute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22 heures et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20 heures (18h heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet. La dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17 h 30. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",
