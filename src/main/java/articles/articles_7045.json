    "title": "Unlike Browns, Jets weren't equipped to deal with adversity",
    "text": "[Sports](/sports) [Football](/sports/football) [New York Jets](/sports/football/jets)\nUnlike Browns, Jets weren't equipped to deal with adversity\nCLEVELAND — Aaron Rodgers was sitting at the middle of a long table in a conference room in the Jets’ offices when the hype surrounding the team was still at an all-time high. He made a point of saying something that proved prescient.\n“We’re going to have to go through adversity to learn how to win and also to deal with the tough moments,” Rodgers said in late August.\nAdversity struck quickly.\nRodgers tore his left Achilles tendon four snaps into the season. Some short-term success followed: the Jets started 4-3. It was fleeting and not sustainable. A second wave of adversity proved too much to overcome for Robert Saleh’s team.\nThe Jets (6-9) went into Thursday night's game against the Cleveland Browns in a very familiar position: out of postseason contention, playing for pride and hoping for better luck next year.\nTeams make their own luck, though, or they’re better equipped to deal with and rise above tough times. The team the Jets faced in their next-to-last game of the season is proof of that.\nThe Browns lost running back Nick Chubb for the season in Week 2. Starting quarterback Deshaun Watson’s season lasted just six games. Like the Jets, Cleveland has had offensive line issues and has started four quarterbacks. Unlike the Jets, the Browns’ season was not lost.\nThe bitter irony for Jets fans is that ex-Jet Joe Flacco was on his couch when the Browns signed him on November 20 and he’s enjoying a rebirth.\nThe 38-year-old quarterback has led Cleveland to three straight wins. The Browns (10-5) were in position to clinch a playoff spot with a win on Thursday night. Kevin Stefanski is a leading NFL Coach of the Year candidate.\nSaleh, who will return next season, said he will take some hard lessons learned into 2024. He also looks at how other teams operate and sees what he can apply to his group. Doing a deep dive on the Browns might not be a bad idea.\n“Yeah, you’re always going to study all of that stuff,” Saleh said. “They’re doing a really nice job defensively. They’re playing at an elite level, very, very similar [to us]. Special teams are doing very well.\n“But for sure, we’ll definitely look at some things and areas where we can be better in the event that this happens again, we can keep the boat above water and kind of replicate what they’re doing.”\nIt’s not just Cleveland. Minnesota, another team that had to start four quarterbacks, is alive in the playoff race despite losing receiver Justin Jefferson for seven games and Kirk Cousins for the season in Week 8. Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are above .500 and are using backup or third-string quarterbacks.\nThe Jets and Browns have similarities on defense. Cleveland has the No. 1 overall defense and top passing defense. The Jets are the NFL’s third-ranked defense and No. 2 passing defense.\nFew similarities exist between the two offenses.\nStefanski, the Browns’ play-caller, adjusted to losing key players and still found ways to move the football and score. The Jets have not adjusted well.\nThey’re last in total offense and touchdowns (16). The Jets have lacked creativity. They’ve struggled to consistently get the ball in space to their two best playmakers: Breece Hall and Garrett Wilson.\nOffensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett will be back next season as well.\nBrowns offensive line coach Bill Callahan has started 10 different players. Cleveland is No. 11 in rushing yards and 10th in rushing touchdowns. The Jets' O-line, coached by Keith Carter, has started 13 different players. The Jets are 28th in rushing and 32nd in rushing touchdowns.\nThe Jets have pinned a lot of this season’s failure on Rodgers’ and the offensive line situation. The line was considered a weakness coming into the season though. There were also questions about the quarterback room behind Rodgers.\nIt was Zach Wilson and Tim Boyle. The Jets added Trevor Siemian two weeks after Rodgers got hurt and Brett Rypien after they waived Boyle three weeks ago.\nWilson was supposed to learn from Rodgers. He ended up taking over for Rodgers and had another rough year. A concussion kept Wilson out Thursday. He may have already played his last game as a Jet. Siemian got the start at Cleveland.\nThe Jets could have signed Flacco after Rodgers got hurt. Flacco’s name came up, but they never called him. Flacco’s 10 touchdown passes in four games with the Browns matched the Jets’ total TDs thrown.\nGarrett Wilson has caught as many touchdown passes from Flacco as Zach Wilson — two in 15 fewer games. Garrett Wilson said he loved playing with Flacco and considers him “a great player.” As for what Flacco is doing with Cleveland, he said, “I would say to people here no one is surprised by that. He’s one of those guys.”\nSometimes teams make their own luck or they’re better equipped to deal with adversity.",

    "title": "Fox News Poll: Nevadans trust Trump over Biden on border security by 22 points | Fox News",
    "text": "The 2024 presidential race in Nevada could be an uphill climb for President Joe Biden , as voters feel negatively about their financial situation and his job performance. Biden trails former President Donald Trump – despite his re-election numbers outpacing his approval and being voters' preferred candidate on abortion – in large part because Trump is widely favored on immigration and the economy.In a hypothetical matchup, Biden receives 45% support to Trump’s 50% in a Fox News survey of Nevada registered voters. That 5-point difference is within the margin of error.The president lags his 2020 vote share by about 5 points, while Trump is overperforming his by nearly 3 points. Biden won Nevada by less than 3 percentage points (50.06% vs. 47.67%). Trump’s edge comes from party loyalty (93% of Republicans back him vs. 89% of Democrats for Biden) and the small subgroup of Independents preferring him by 11 points.The survey was conducted June 1-4, so all interviewing was completed after Trump's New York hush-money verdict and almost all of it was before Biden announced his executive order on immigration. FOX NEWS POLL: ABORTION, ECONOMY, AND BORDER SECURITY ARE TOP DEAL-BREAKERS IN 2024 ELECTIONS The race has an extremely large 27-point gender gap, as men favor Trump by 18 points and women back Biden by 9. White voters favor Trump by 12 points, while Biden is ahead among non-whites by 14 and Hispanics by 7. Compared to 2020, Trump is overperforming a touch with each of these groups while Biden is underperforming -- but not by a lot. By a 6-point margin, Trump (96%) retains more of his 2020 supporters than Biden (90%).Biden is up by just 1 point among union households, a group he won by 15 points in 2020, according to the Nevada Fox News Voter Analysis election survey . In a potential expanded race, the new survey finds Trump’s advantage over Biden stays at 5 points (45% vs. 40%), with third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 7%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each.Under this scenario, Kennedy takes equally from Biden and Trump, as 6% of each of their supporters in the 2-way matchup defected to RFK in the expanded ballot. However, it is the presence of the other candidates that leaves Biden a bit more damaged, as 5% of his backers go for West or Stein compared to just 2% for Trump. Overall, 87% of Biden supporters in the 2-way race stick with him in the larger ballot while Trump keeps 90% of his. Among Independents, Trump gets 35%, Biden 23%, Kennedy 22%, West 5%, and Stein 4%. Currently, Kennedy, Stein, and West are not officially on the Nevada ballot.Equal numbers of Biden and Trump supporters (68% each) say they are extremely motivated to vote in the election . Self-identified conservatives (78% extremely motivated) and those strongly approving of Biden’s job performance are among those with the highest motivation (83%). If their enthusiasm continues, it helps Trump that Republicans are more motivated to vote than Democrats and those saying Biden was not legitimately elected are more motivated than those who acknowledge his victory was legitimate. Biden’s job rating in the Silver State is negative by 16 points: 42% approve, while 58% disapprove. More than twice as many strongly disapprove (46%) as strongly approve (20%). Those ratings mostly match how he is doing nationally.One of the things that keeps the 2-way matchup close is that Biden tops Trump by 8 points among the small subgroup who only \"somewhat\" disapprove of his job performance.Nevadans feel bad about their finances, as about four times as many say they are falling behind (49%) as getting ahead (13%). Almost 4 in 10 say they are holding steady financially. \"Biden’s main problem in Nevada is the economic recovery he has touted in many places isn’t being felt in Nevada,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Half say they are losing ground financially, including 59% of Independents and 30% of Democrats.\"More voters trust Biden to do a better job on the climate (Biden +12), abortion (B +11), and health care (B +5), while more trust Trump on the Israel-Hamas war (T +13), the economy (T +16), and immigration/border security (T +22). It’s mostly a tossup on election integrity (B +1). Some voters still support Biden’s re-election despite believing Trump would do a better job on big issues. For example, 15% of those saying Trump would do better on immigration back Biden, as do 10% who prefer Trump on the war in Gaza. Likewise, some of those saying Biden would do better on abortion and climate change back Trump (13% each).By a 51-46% margin, Nevada voters say Trump’s hush-money trial in New York was fair. Among the one-third who say his conviction will matter a great deal or some to their vote, 66% back Biden and 29% Trump.Hispanics and voters under 30 are among those most likely to say Trump’s conviction will matter to their vote. Among voters who backed Trump in 2020, nearly 9 in 10 think his trial was unfair while 2 in 10 say it will matter. The candidates are viewed negatively by Nevadans. By an 8-point margin, more voters have an unfavorable than favorable view of Trump, while Biden ratings are net negative by 17 points. Kennedy’s are underwater by 12 points, with 17% unable to rate him.Among voters who have a positive opinion of Kennedy, far more view Biden negatively (68% unfavorable) than Trump (43% unfavorable). FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE STUDENT PROTESTS, SAY THEY HAVEN'T MADE THEM MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE PALESTINIANS The survey also asks about two potential state ballot measures -- one that would require valid identification before voting and another that would establish the right to an abortion before fetal viability. Most voters, 73%, favor guaranteeing the right to abortion , and a larger 84% majority approves of requiring voter ID. Over half of those backing Trump (55%) and almost all of those supporting Biden (93%) would favor the abortion initiative. On the voter identification amendment, nearly three-quarters of Biden’s backers (72%) and virtually all of Trump’s supporters (95%) would vote for it.Republican Joe Lombardo was elected as Nevada’s governor in 2022 with 49% of the vote. His popularity has grown, as 57% approve of the job he’s doing, including 42% of Democrats. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Voters who have a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump (aka double haters) favor Biden over Trump by 4 points in the rematch, more than 8 in 10 of them would vote yes on both ballot measures, 7 in 10 think Trump received a fair trial, and 4 in 10 say his conviction will matter a great deal or some to their vote.Among self-identified Independents (those not identifying or leaning toward either the Democratic or Republican parties), about 8 in 10 favor each potential amendment, 5 in 10 say the hush-money trial was fair, 4 in 10 say Trump’s conviction will make a difference to their vote, and 3 in 10 approve of the job Biden is doing as president.CLICK HERE FOR TOPLINE AND CROSSTABS Conducted June 1-4, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,069 Nevada registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents were given the option of completing the interview in English or Spanish and speaking with live interviewers on landlines (168) and cellphones (674) or completing the survey online after receiving a text (227). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.

    "text": "Power now restored to all homes in Scotland affected by Storm Gerrit All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland.

Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” We need your consent to load this Social Media content.

SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.",
