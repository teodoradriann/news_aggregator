    "title": "Federal funds to feed more Niagara students",
    "text": "A Niagara school food program advocate is hungry for more details after the federal government announced it will fund a national program as grocery prices and housing costs rise. “We don’t know the details just yet, but the part that’s clear is these funds will support and strengthen already existing provincial and territorial programs, which includes us,” said Jessica Stephenson, program manager for Niagara Nutrition Partners. “We’re eagerly anticipating collaborating with colleagues nationwide to implement improvements to this crucial service for students, as the funding will enable us the ability to expand and reach more students.” While 24,000 students among Niagara’s four school boards access food programs, there are still 10 schools waiting to participate. Stephenson said the new funding will ensure no student is left behind. [The federal government Monday pledged $1 billion over five years](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/justin-trudeau-announces-national-school-food-program-amid-rising-grocery-prices/article_4f072c14-f042-11ee-ad92-d337b49d7122.html) to lay the foundation for access to healthier foods for nearly 400,000 children not served through existing school food programs, mainly from lower-income, Indigenous and racialized communities. The Liberal government is expected to add program funding to its budget being released later this month, fulfilling a 2021 campaign promise, as the program is expected to start in the 2024-25 school year. Canada is the only G7 country that does not have some framework in place for a national school food program. In Niagara child poverty is more than 18 per cent, just above the national average. Broken down into electoral ridings, according to Food Banks Canada’s website, St. Catharines had 22 per cent of children living in poverty, while Niagara Falls and Niagara Centre had 20.7 and 20.4 per cent, respectively, or one in five children, living in poverty. “Federal help will put us in a better position to purchase quality foods kids deserve, and in turn, will provide relief and peace of mind to families left making difficult choices between, groceries and household bills,” said Stephenson. But she stressed the importance of understanding this does not mean school food programs are fully government-funded, rather they will still need community support to ensure all kids continue to have access. “It’ll be a cost-sharing effort, as we move forward. So, it’ll include the feds, the province and then our municipal communities at large,” she said. Amberley Ruetz, a post-doctoral fellow at University of Saskatchewan, and author of “The Economic Rationale for Investing in School Meal Programs,” said the benefits of food programs are greater than just nourishing kids. “There was fascinating research out of Sweden, which found women whose families had access to school meal programs increased their participation by five per cent in the labor market,” she said. “Similar to childcare, it’s another, wraparound support for families, and mothers in particular.” Ruetz said school food programs yield everyday economic and community improvements. “Longstanding research in Sweden, and in the States, found school meal programs have upwards of seven times return on investment,” she said. “Every dollar put in gets $7 back in terms of improvements to education, human health and economic development.” She said another plus to the funding meal programs is employment opportunities. “When you build a national program, it means you need more workers to prepare meals, to deliver the food and there’s markets for local growers,” she said. “This is a win across the board and something, we often speak about is the learning and health outcomes, which are important and well documented in the research, but now this new area of economic development is exciting.” St. Catharines MPP Jennie Stevens said school food program funding provided by the province, and now the federal government, falls short when it comes to ensuring every child is fed in school, but it is a start. “It was a significant and positive achievement, but we all know it’s never going to be enough,” she said. “The province was waiting on some mention from the federal throne speech/ It’s evident provinces, including Ontario, have been waiting for this announcement.” Stevens said the program should see bipartisan support and it should not be used as an election stepping stone. “We have to ensure as members of the provincial government, and as members of the federal government, that no child is left waiting due to bureaucratic delays, and that every child has a full stomach,” she said. “No child in Niagara should go to school hungry and it’s up to the federal government to bring this program forward.”",

Learn more about us.\nDiscrimination against LGBTQ+ people throughout the U.S. and around the world contributes to LGBTQ+ health disparities. A new Harvard center wants to shift that paradigm.\nThe LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence, based at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and in partnership with Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, aims to advance health equity for LGBTQ people. Studies have shown that LGBTQ people suffer worse health than their peers, with higher prevalences of both mental health ailments, such as depression, and physical illnesses, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\nIn 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognized these significant and well-documented inequities by designating LGBTQ individuals as a health disparities population, opening the door for more research into the field. The result has been a marked increase in LGBTQ research—but Brittany Charlton, founding director of the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence, says that there is still much more work to be done.\n“Just 1% of NIH-funded research is dedicated to LGBTQ health,” said Charlton, Harvard Medical School associate professor of population medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School. “That is so out of step with the fact that one in 10 people in the U.S. are LGBTQ, and that that number is twice as high among young people.”\nThe LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence, which launched June 4 during Harvard Chan’s Pride Month celebration, aims to tackle this shortfall by committing to deepening research in the field. It intends to award pilot grants for LGBTQ health research, as well as support to existing studies examining the subject. Charlton says that specific attention must be paid to data collection. Since information about sexual orientation and gender identity are not routinely gathered as part of care for health care visits, quantifying health disparities faced by the LGBTQ population can be challenging for researchers; improved data collection will open up more opportunities for research.\nRead the full article about LGBTQ+ health disparities by Jeff Sobotko at Harvard T.H.

    "text": "The Gen Z protests also disrupted travel plans for students and teachers proceeding to and from the Kenya Music Festival in Eldoret. Schools’ principals had to adjust their travel plans to safeguard their students as well as give learners an opportunity to take part in the festival. Several Regional festival officials issued a travel advisory, urging school buses to avoid the risk of being caught in the demonstrations. Through their WhatsApp groups, the officials warned teachers against risking lives. “To guarantee learners’ and your own safety, it has been advised that teams intending to leave Eldoret for Nairobi in the morning should delay their departure slightly until the situation can be assessed and further guidance given,” one official communicated. Teams leaving Nairobi for Eldoret were advised to proceed with caution, ideally setting off early in the morning to beat the protests. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Many schools took this advice, with students departing as early as 4:30 a.m. to navigate the roads before any disruptions could occur. “We are in Naivasha en route to Eldoret. Pray for us for journey mercies,” one teacher posted at 6 a.m. This precautionary measure deviates from the Ministry of Education’s usual guidelines, which typically restrict school bus travel. Festival officials closely monitored the situation throughout the day.",

    "text": "Mit Inklusion gegen Fachkräftemangel in Kitas Stand: 26.06.2025 07:02 Uhr\nRegelmäßig müssen Kindertagesstätten in Niedersachsen ihre Betreuung einschränken, weil das Personal fehlt. Einige Kitas in Niedersachsen möchten nun gegensteuern und sich gleichzeitig für Inklusion einsetzen.\nMit dem Projekt \"Inklusion in Kita-Teams\" möchte der Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband Hannover Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen für die Arbeit in einer Kindertagesstätte qualifizieren. Das Ziel: der Einstieg in ein sozialversicherungspflichtiges Beschäftigungsverhältnis. Leonie Warnecke ist eine der ersten Teilnehmerinnen. Bislang hat sie unter anderem in einer Werkstatt für Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen gearbeitet, nun betreut sie Kinder in einer Kita in Hannover. \"Man ist hier einfach freier und die Arbeit mit den Kindern macht mir sehr viel Spaß\", erzählt die 33-Jährige.\nTeilnehmer werden Kita-Assistenten In dem Projekt werden Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen als Kita-Assistenten weitergebildet und bekommen dann reguläre Arbeitsverträge. Dabei muss aber die Kita nur 25 Prozent des Gehalts selbst aufbringen, der Großteil wird über ein Förderprogramm finanziert. Der Paritätische Niedersachsen gehört nach eigenen Angaben zum ersten Kita-Träger, der ein solches Projekt in Niedersachsen betreibt.\nProjekt gilt als Meilenstein Die Projektverantwortlichen ziehen eine positive Zwischenbilanz. Die Vorsitzende des Paritätischen Niedersachsen, Kerstin Tack, nennt das Projekt einen Meilenstein. Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen würden sich mit wertvollen Fähigkeiten einbringen und die Kinder erlebten durch das Projekt gelebte Inklusion.\nQuelle: ndr Dieses Thema im Programm: NDR Fernsehen | Hallo Niedersachsen | 25.06.2025 | 19:30 Uhr",
