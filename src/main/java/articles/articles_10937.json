    "text": "Prisma Health announces $138M behavioral health hospital in Pickens County Prisma Health [announced Thursday](https://prismahealth.org/patients-and-guests/news/prisma-health-to-build-inpatient-behavioral-health-hospital) it will spend $138 million on a new 112-bed inpatient behavioral health hospital in Pickens County. Prisma will partner with the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and use $100 million in state-allocated funding for the new facility. It will replace the 65-bed [Marshall I. Pickens Psychiatric Hospital](https://prismahealth.org/locations/hospitals/marshall-i-pickens-hospital) located on the Memorial Hospital campus in Greenville. The facility will take about two years to build and will quadruple the number of beds available for children receiving inpatient mental health care, according to Prisma. Prisma president and chief executive Mark O’Halla said the project would not be possible without the state's investment. “This project is a powerful example of what we can accomplish through public-private partnerships and is a significant and much-needed step forward for our communities and state,\" O'Halla said in a statement. \"As a safety-net provider, Prisma Health is committed to caring for all patients, regardless of their ability to pay, which means operating the facility with an annual financial loss. This project is only possible due to the state’s investment, which enables us to meet the growing need for behavioral health care in our communities.\" The company hopes to begin site work in the spring. According to Prisma, the number of patients admitted for psychiatric treatment has risen nearly 50% over the last six years between Pickens, Oconee, and Greenville counties. MIPH opened in 1969 and serves about 1,500 patients each year. Prisma said about 1,200 patients coming to its Upstate emergency departments must be transported to other facilities. The MIPH facility has only 10 beds for children and adolescents. The new facility will be licensed for 40, offering more room for inpatient treatment. Prisma is the only Upstate hospital that admits psychiatric patients ages 12 or younger. The hospital will have private and semi-private rooms and the staff will offer specialized care for all ages including adults who require intensive care. South Carolina House Rep. Bruce Bannister (R-Greenville), House Ways and Means Committee chairperson, said the project is \"long overdue.\" \"The Prisma Health Marshall I. Pickens Psychiatric Hospital has served Greenville and Upstate families well for decades, and I am thrilled this public-private partnership will not only expand these services but expand access in the modern environment our community deserves,” Bannister said. Gov. Henry McMaster also expressed support for the new hospital. “South Carolina is no stranger to the behavioral health crisis sweeping our nation, and the inpatient and outpatient services in our state to support our citizens are woefully insufficient,” McMaster said. “This project is an important step forward in addressing the statewide need for an expansion of behavioral health services whenever and wherever possible.” In addition to the new hospital, Prisma committed to spending $7 million on behavioral health services, including expanding its intensive outpatient program at the Greenville Memorial Hospital campus. Prisma is the largest healthcare organization in the state and serves about 1.5 million patients annually across 21 counties.

I would ask for your indulgence.”\nMr Macron also said that France will continue to support Ukraine “as long as necessary.”\nAsked about recent visits to Russia and China by Mr Viktor Orban, Mr Macron said the Hungarian prime minister did not go there with any “mandate” from the EU.

    "text": "Der diesjährige Sportabzeichentag, fest verankert im Schulkalender und orientiert an den Anforderungen des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes (DOSB), motivierte die gesamte Schulgemeinschaft zu sportlichen Höchstleistungen – bei Sonnenschein, angenehmen Temperaturen und bester Stimmung.\nBereits am frühen Morgen herrschte auf dem Weikersheimer Sportplatz und im Käfig neben der Schule reges Treiben. Ausgestattet mit Sportsachen, Wasserflaschen und einer gehörigen Portion Motivation traten alle Schülerinnen und Schüler der Klassenstufen 5 bis 11 in verschiedenen Disziplinen an: Sprint, Weitsprung, Weitwurf, Standweitsprung, Seilspringen, Kugelstoßen sowie ein Ausdauerlauf standen auf dem Programm. Leider musste in diesem Jahr auf das Schwimmen verzichtet werden – das Hallenbad befindet sich derzeit in der Renovierungsphase.\nDie Organisation und Durchführung eines solch umfangreichen sportlichen Großereignisses wäre ohne die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Klassenstufe 12 nicht denkbar gewesen. Als Riegenführer, Zeitnehmer, Motivatoren und Koordinatoren trugen sie maßgeblich dazu bei, dass der Tag reibungslos verlief. Auch das gesamte Lehrerkollegium war im Einsatz – an jeder Station wurde gestoppt, gemessen, gezählt und vor allem angefeuert.\nNeben vielen persönlichen Bestleistungen und sportlichen Erfolgen war eines besonders spürbar: die Freude an der Bewegung und das gemeinschaftliche Erlebnis. Die Kinder und Jugendlichen feuerten sich gegenseitig an, überwanden persönliche Grenzen und entdeckten mitunter auch ungeahnte sportliche Talente.\n„Es geht nicht nur um Medaillen oder Zeiten, sondern darum, gemeinsam aktiv zu sein und Spaß an der Bewegung zu haben“, lautete die Grundintension der Fachschaft Sport, die sich über die große Begeisterung und das sportliche Miteinander freute.\nDer Sportabzeichentag am Gymnasium Weikersheim bleibt somit nicht nur als sportliches Event in Erinnerung, sondern auch als starkes Zeichen für Zusammenhalt, Motivation und Freude – Werte, die weit über den Sportplatz hinaus wirken.\nDieser Inhalt wird uns zur Verfügung gestellt\nWir veröffentlichen Beiträge von Vereinen, Schulen sowie anderen Gruppierungen und Einrichtungen aus Unterfranken.

L’entreprise l’indique comme plus efficace que GPT-4o à la fois sur les questions de tous les jours, les questions professionnelles, et sur la créativité.\nPar rapport à GPT-4o, GPT-4.5 pourra s’appuyer sur une base de données élargie, et devrait mieux distinguer les intentions de l’utilisateur, en détectant plus efficacement les émotions de celui-ci, tout en ayant moins d’hallucinations. Il supporte l'envoi de fichiers et d'images et peut travailler sur des écrits et du code, mais ne permet pas la reconnaissance vocale, la vidéo ou le partage d'écran.\nReste que dans le domaine mathématique et dans la création de code, GPT-4.5 devrait toujours être dépassé par o3-mini, dont le raisonnement est mieux adapté à ces domaines.\nGPT-4.5 est accessible dès aujourd’hui aux comptes Pro, et le sera la semaine prochaine pour les utilisateurs de ChatGPT Plus. La date de disponibilité aux utilisateurs gratuits n’a pas été annoncée.",

    "text": "Kirsty Bortoft was placed into a medically induced coma. Kirsty Bortoft, mother of three kids, planned a cozy night with her partner Stu, but hours later, he found her \"lifeless\" on the sofa. Doctors revived her after 40 minutes, but during that time, Kirsty claims she saw various things, according to The Metro. Eyes wide open, she described \"strange\" patterns on her skin and witnessed unknown happenings. Now, she shared her near-death experience, leaving everyone curious about what she saw in those 40 lost minutes. Ms Bortoft, who hails from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, faced a significant medical challenge and defied the odds by surviving despite a low chance of recovery. She persevered through several instances of cardiac arrest and underwent a medically induced coma, reported the news outlet. She said, \"The first night was crucial, and it wasn't looking good. Stu was told he should prepare for me not making it, but he wasn't having any of it.\" \"No one at this point knew what was going on apart from my immediate family, but my psychic friend got in touch with my sister and asked what was going on. She said my spirit was in her front room, and I was asking her to write lists for my boys and dad. I told my friend that my body was breaking down and I didn't think I could get back into it, but she got stern with me and told me to go back,\" Ms Bortoft said, recounting the events that transpired while she was unconscious. \"Meanwhile, in the hospital, my family was being told to prepare themselves for the end,\" she added. After waking from her coma, Ms Bortoft instantly asked for Stu. Miraculously, scans showed almost no damage to her heart or lungs, defying expectations mere weeks after her near-death experience. \"I recall, upon finally coming back into my body, that I knew exactly what I needed to do to heal, like a download of information. I realised you don't die; only your body moves on, and that my mission here isn't over yet,\" Ms Bortoft told The Metro. \"I told the doctor I healed my lungs, and he asked how, so I shared my story. I left feeling elated and excited about my recovery.\"",

    "title": "El Tribunal de Disciplina firmó el descenso de Colón, pero resta un detalle: que la AFA lo haga oficial",
    "text": "La espera hace ilusionar más de la cuenta a los hinchas de Colón de Santa Fe, que se aferraron a la decisión del Tribunal de Disciplina de la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino ( AFA ), órgano en el que el Sabalero presentó algo así como un amparo para evitar el descenso, que se consumó tras la derrota en el partido desempate ante Gimnasia de La Plata . Sin embargo, desde el ingreso del escrito la suerte estaba echada: el pedido no prosperó y así lo confirmará la AFA cuando publique el fallo con la negativa, que ya fue firmada. Colón es uno de los equipos que en 2024 conformará la Primera Nacional , aunque todavía no haya recibido la comunicación formal. Este jueves, en su primera conferencia como flamante presidente del Sabalero, Víctor Godano , lo dio por hecho, aún sin el fallo publicado, cuando enumeró el estado en que encontró el club y remarcó que en diciembre \"cayó la recaudación por masa societaria\". \"Entendemos que puede ser porque en diciembre no hay fútbol o porque el club descendió , pero .si queremos un club grande, tenemos que respaldar ese compromiso\", indicó el presidente Godano en conferencia de prensa, desmarcándose de la presentación del ex presidente José Vignatti , mentor del pedido de anulación del descenso. El pedido cursado por el abogado Ariel Reck en representación de Colón centró el reclamo en los cambios que sufrió el reglamento en medio de la temporada en curso, situación que consideró “inadmisible”. En una asamblea a mediados de año, se eliminó uno de los tres descensos previstos y se determinó que perderían la categoría el equipo de peor promedio ( Arsenal ) y el último de la tabla general (en este caso, Colón ). \"La presentación fue de la comisión anterior, así que no hemos seguido ese trámite. El martes tenemos una reunión con (el presidente Claudio) Tapia en AFA, pero no sabemos cual es el tema, sólo que nos van a recibir por ser integrantes de una nueva comisión\", indicó Godano. Sin embargo el vice primero, Marcelo Negrete, no le cerró la persiana al asunto. \"Hablamos con Iván (Delfino, el nuevo entrenador) sobre la idea de mantener la base del plantel. Pero dependemos mucho también de la decisión de Colón en Primera o Colón en Nacional B (sic), eso es fundamental para pensar en un plantel\", distinguió el dirigente, que todavía le prende una vela a un fallo que ya tiene firma y aguarda por su publicación. “Una modificación del reglamento con la competencia ya en curso y los planteles lógicamente contratados sobre un reglamento anterior no puede ser válidamente admitido. Este nuevo sistema adoptado una vez que la temporada ya estaba en curso es abiertamente ilegítimo y violatorio de las garantías de igualdad jurídica y deportiva”, se leé en uno de los fundamentos de Colón. El otro eje de la presentación tuvo que ver con el órgano que decidió la modificación: según el escrito de Reck era el Comité Ejecutivo el adecuado y no la Asamblea, como sucedió. \"Un partido desempate disputado sobre la base de un reglamento alterado en medio de la competencia sin la aprobación de todos los miembros del Comité Ejecutivo no puede admitirse. Las modificaciones de la Asamblea de junio 2023 (…), debieron en todo caso regir para la temporada 2024\", se distingue en el párrafo que antecede el pedido de “nulidad” del descenso. Sin embargo, la respuesta del Tribunal fue negativa. Los argumentos que le pusieron fin al pedido del Sabalero se basan en lo \"extemporáneo\" del pedido. Para que el Tribunal asumiera un debate al respecto, Colón debería haber presentado el reclamo antes de que se consumara su descenso. \"Por lo menos antes del partido ante Gimnasia, no después”, explicó una fuente del órgano. “Se aceptó el pedido (de Colón) por una cuestión de cortesía social, digamos, y de mantener un espíritu de que no rechazamos in limine nada, porque eso hubiese dejado muy expuesto al club. Lo aceptamos, pero es imposible que el Tribunal diga que este partido es anulable. Imposible. No hay ninguna chance del lado nuestro, ninguna chance. No estamos para anular partidos”, le confirmó dos semanas atrás a Clarín un miembro del Tribunal. Sin embargo, aquella certeza todavía no es oficial. ¿Por qué si el Tribunal tenía tan clara su postura, no se expidió en el curso de la misma semana? Hasta la Liga Profesional aguardó a su publicación para difundir su fixture 2024. La respuesta para tanta expectativa es del orden burocrático. La tardanza en la presentación del descargo de Gimnasia y la agenda apretada de los miembros de Tribunal -en su mayoría jueces en distintos fueros- impidieron la redacción de un fallo que no tuvo debate. \"Para fundamentarlo necesitamos al menos un par de horas y el descargo de Gimnasia llegó a último momento. La verdad es que no hubo tiempo\", se excusó un miembro del Tribunal de Disciplina por la demora. La participación de Gimnasia fue meramente administrativa. Por haber jugado el partido desempate, fue nombrado por Colón en su escrito y el Tribunal debía escuchar su postura, aunque tardía. El Lobo, no aportó ningún dato que obligara al cuerpo colegiado a rever su postura. El Sabalero estuvo siempre solo en esa cruzada. La publicación que esperan todos se hace desear, pero su contenido no sorprenderá a nadie. El escritoriazo de Colón, no prosperó.",
