    "text": "ENDANGERED Hogs in one of the piggeries in Mlang, Cotabato face the danger of getting contaminated after the African Swine Fever have spread to 10 villages of the town. WILLAMOR A. MAGBANUA\nFaced with another crisis that may pressure food prices, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday vowed to ensure the safety of the country’s hog population as 10,000 vaccine doses against African swine fever (ASF) were expected to arrive on Friday.\n“We are securing our hog industry with the upcoming rollout of an African swine fever vaccine for backyard and commercial farms, made possible through the generosity of our partners in the private sector, who have offered their cold storage facilities,” the President said after meeting with his Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC).\nADVERTISEMENT READ: DA supplier donates vaccines to fight African Swine Fever\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Marcos moves Ninoy Aquino Day to August 23 for longer weekend NEWSINFO LIST: Canceled flights on August 16 due to Typhoon Ampil’s threat NEWSINFO Solon hits Cardemas over alleged disinformation, conflict of interest “Our industry is at a critical juncture, and immediate action is required to safeguard our hog sector. The recommendations presented today reflect our collective commitment to not only addressing the immediate threats but also to ensuring long-term resilience,” said PSAC lead convener and Aboitiz Group president Sabin Aboitiz.\nThe vaccines were acquired by the Department of Agriculture (DA) through emergency procurement.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the government is targeting to begin vaccination in several towns in Batangas province and prevent the further spread of African swine fever.\n“Hopefully, our target is to begin the vaccination by Tuesday next week,” Laurel said in an episode of Malacañang Insider.\nIndemnification program Aside from procuring vaccines, Laurel also said the DA is finalizing a policy to increase the compensation for hog raisers affected by ASF.\nThe indemnification for affected hog raisers will be raised to P4,000 for every culled piglet due to animal disease. For medium-sized pigs and big or breeder pigs, the payment is set at P8,000 and P12,000, respectively, for each condemned pig.\nADVERTISEMENT “We are finalizing the policy governing the indemnification program for pigs,” Laurel said.\nAt present, affected local raisers are paid P5,000 for every infected hog regardless of the pig’s size.\nThe policy, he explained, would encourage hog raisers to cull or surrender pigs infected by ASF and help them recover their losses because of this infection.\nHowever, the agriculture chief recognized the challenge of raising more funds to indemnify as many hog raisers as possible since the budget allocation for this initiative is only P150 million.\n“We are seeking additional budget so that hopefully, it will increase to P300 million, and help more affected livestock operators,” he said.\nThe DA is bolstering laboratories and research efforts to eventually manufacture vaccines in the country “in the near future,” the agriculture secretary said.\nLivestock checkpoints Amid the continued presence of ASF in some parts of the country, the DA chief said the situation is “not that alarming because the vaccine is on the way.”\n“Hopefully, we can contain this. But, of course, it will not be easy, but we will do our best,” he said.Eight towns in Batangas have declared a state of emergency—Lobo, Lian, Calatagan, Rosario, Lipa, Talisay, San Juan and Tuy.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) inspectors seized 60 hogs at a checkpoint in Tandang Sora, Quezon City, and are being tested to determine if they are infected with ASF.\nIf the disease is detected, they will be condemned and taken to a central burial site.According to the BAI, documents presented at the Tandang Sora checkpoint by the transporter, allegedly from Sariaya, Quezon, for slaughter in Caloocan City were found to be fraudulent.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

[EL SIGLO DE TORREÓN](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=EL+SIGLO+DE+TORRE%C3%93N) La inteligencia artificial (IA) ha revolucionado numerosos aspectos de nuestra vida, pero también ha brindado a los ciberdelincuentes nuevas herramientas para perpetrar estafas cada vez más sofisticadas, así puedes protegerte de ellos. ¿Cómo se utiliza la IA en las estafas? La capacidad de la IA para procesar grandes cantidades de datos, generar textos y hasta simular voces humanas ha hecho que cada vez sea más difícil distinguir lo real de lo falso. Esta herramienta que puede ser muy útil para las personas, también ha generado preocupación, pues los delincuentes también le han encontrado un uso para cometer estafas electrónicas, por ejemplo; Los deepfakes, que son videos o audios falsos creados por IA que simulan la imagen o la voz de una persona real. Estos pueden ser utilizados para difundir información falsa o para extorsionar a personas. Los chatbots sofisticados, es decir, programas de computadora diseñados para simular conversaciones humanas, que se utilizan para engañar a las personas y obtener información personal. Un phishing altamente personalizado, para facilitar la creación de correos electrónicos y mensajes de texto fraudulentos se vuelven cada vez más personalizados gracias a la IA, lo que aumenta las posibilidades de que sean abiertos y respondidos. O la creación de contenido falso como noticias falsas, reseñas de productos falsas y otro tipo de contenido engañoso para manipular la opinión pública o dañar la reputación de personas o empresas. ¿Qué podemos hacer para protegernos? Como en cualquier otra estafa, asegúrate de: - Verificar la información: Antes de compartir o actuar sobre cualquier información, verifica su fuente. Desconfía de las noticias que parecen demasiado buenas para ser ciertas o que generan emociones fuertes. - Ser cauteloso con los enlaces y archivos adjuntos: No hagas clic en enlaces o descargues archivos adjuntos de correos electrónicos o mensajes de texto de remitentes desconocidos. - Utilizar contraseñas fuertes y únicas: Crea contraseñas seguras y diferentes para cada una de tus cuentas en línea. - Mantener actualizado el software: Asegúrate de que tu sistema operativo, aplicaciones y antivirus estén siempre actualizados. - Ser cuidadoso con la información personal: Evita compartir información personal en redes sociales o en sitios web no seguros. - Educarte sobre las últimas estafas: Mantente informado sobre las últimas tendencias en ciberseguridad y las estafas más comunes. ¿Cómo te cuidas de las estafas?",

    "text": "CLEVELAND -- [Joe Flacco](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco)'s improbable revival season reached another level on \"Thursday Night Football\" as he led the [Cleveland Browns](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns) to a playoff berth with a 37-20 win over the [New York Jets](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets). Flacco become the first player in NFL history to have 250 passing yards and multiple passing touchdowns in each of his first five games with a franchise. The Browns signed Flacco on Nov. 20 after [Deshaun Watson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson) suffered a season-ending shoulder injury on Nov. 12. The Browns led 34-17 at the half, marking the highest-scoring first half since 2019, when the 49ers and Saints combined for 55 points in Week 14 (the 49ers won 48-46), according to ESPN Stats & Information. Cleveland Browns The [Cleveland Browns](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns) are playoff bound. The Browns destroyed the [New York Jets](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets) to clinch their first spot in the AFC playoffs since 2020. Cleveland, with four straight wins, is surging at just the right time heading into the postseason. QB breakdown: Flacco once again was fabulous. For the fourth time in his five starts, he led the Browns down the field on the opening drive for a touchdown. He then capped Cleveland's 34-point first-half scoring barrage by scrambling outside the pocket to his left to find [Jerome Ford](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372019/jerome-ford) wide open for a 50-yard touchdown throw. In the first half alone, Flacco tossed three touchdowns and passed for 296 yards, the most in any half in his career, according to ESPN Stats & Information. He now has more than 300 passing yards in every victory of this four-game winning streak. Buy on a breakout performance: Tight end [David Njoku](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123076/david-njoku) is playing the best ball of his career. With star receiver [Amari Cooper](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976499/amari-cooper) (heel) out, Njoku stepped up with 113 receiving yards in the first quarter. That alone was the second-best receiving game of his career. Njoku has four touchdown catches over his past four games and is proving to be one of the league's top tight end receiving threats. Pivotal play: Rookie safety [Ronnie Hickman](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569620/ronnie-hickman) intercepted [Trevor Siemian](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2511109/trevor-siemian) for a 30-yard pick-six in the first quarter. That gave the Browns a 20-7 lead that put the Jets on their heels the rest of the way. -- Jake Trotter Next game: at Bengals (TBD, Sunday, Jan. 7) New York Jets The idea that [Aaron Rodgers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers)' anticipated return in 2024 will magically fix the New York Jets -- the company line -- is woefully misguided. They have too many issues for one player to solve, and many of them were on display in an embarrassing loss in prime time. In addition to the usual sins -- sloppy penalties, questionable playcalling, shaky game management, etc. -- the Jets were undermined by the supposed strength of the team. Their third-ranked defense looked ill-prepared and got torched by Flacco. The Jets had no answers for a Cleveland offense that was on its fourth quarterback and didn't have its top wide receiver (Cooper) and top running back ( [Nick Chubb](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb)). And yet the 38-year-old Flacco played like it was 2012, the year he led the [Baltimore Ravens](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens) to the Super Bowl title. The Jets allowed five touchdowns and 367 total yards -- in the first half! And the Jets went into the season thinking they could recreate the 1985 Bears. Cue the laugh track. Robert Saleh's record dropped to 17-34 as the Jets (6-10) hit double-digit losses for the fourth straight year. Troubling trend: The Jets' QB4 (Siemian) was badly outplayed by the Browns' QB4, underscoring a question that will haunt the Jets into the offseason: Why didn't they re-sign Flacco when Rodgers was injured in Week 1? Flacco is enjoying a career revival, showing the Jets firsthand what they could've had. Meanwhile, the Jets' quarterback play has been among the worst in the league. Biggest hole in the game plan: OK, we're nitpicking, considering the mass ineptitude, but the Jets' coverage plan for tight end David Njoku was terrible. Linebacker [C.J. Mosley](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16720/cj-mosley) covered him on a couple of the big plays in the first quarter, setting the tone for the game. Mosley is a terrific player, but pass coverage isn't his strength. He allowed three completions for 76 yards as the nearest defender, according to Next Gen Stats. Njoku finished with 134 yards on six catches. Silver linings: [Breece Hall](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427366/breece-hall) was the best player on the field for the Jets. He rushed for 84 yards and scored on a 21-yard reception, continuing his late-season surge. Defensive end [Jermaine Johnson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567962/jermaine-johnson) made the play of the night, returning an interception 37 yards for a touchdown, and [Garrett Wilson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson) became the first Jets player since Keyshawn Johnson (1998-1999) to reach 1,000 receiving yards in back-to-back seasons. Bold prediction: Siemian -- not [Zach Wilson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361259/zach-wilson) -- will close out the season against the [New England Patriots](https://www.espn.in/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots). Even if Wilson clears concussion protocol, why would he want to return for this mess? -- Rich Cimini Next game: at Patriots (TBD, Sunday, Jan. 7)",

    "title": "\"垃圾无归处\"成日本旅游短板，专家：因公共安全考量致大量垃圾桶被撤除|东京|乱扔垃圾|公共场所_网易订阅",
    "text": "来源：环球时报\n【环球时报综合报道】日本观光厅最新调查暴露了旅游体验痛点——“找不到垃圾桶” 持续成为访日游客心头之患。\n据《今日日本》6日报道，这项调查在2024年12月至2025年1月期间进行，在日本北海道新千岁、成田、羽田、关西和福冈五大机场对超过4000名准备离境的游客发起了问卷调研。结果显示，21.9%的受访外国游客将“垃圾桶太少”列为旅行中最受困扰的事。尽管这一比例比前一年下降了约8%，但“带着垃圾游日本”已成常态，不少游客戏称自己被迫开启“负重旅行”，直到返回旅馆才能卸下垃圾“包袱”。\n有专家表示，日本过去在公共区域设置的垃圾桶数量可观。然而，受1995年东京地铁沙林毒气袭击、2004年马德里列车爆炸案等恐怖袭击事件的影响，出于公共安全考量，大量垃圾桶被陆续撤除。这一举措虽在一定程度上提升了公共场所的安全性，却也导致游客聚集地乱扔垃圾现象日益严重。负责在公共场所安装太阳能垃圾桶的Forcetec公司的社长竹村阳平介绍称，“纽约和巴黎等城市约设置3万个公共垃圾桶，而在东京，由政府设置并维护的垃圾桶几乎消失不见，仅有私企安装和管理的垃圾桶零星分布”。针对这一现象，不少网民在社交平台留言称，“虽然这是一项面向游客的调查，但这也是许多日本民众的烦恼”。\n据报道，此次调查还暴露出其他服务短板。15.2% 的受访游客提到存在语言壁垒，餐厅等场所的工作人员英语水平较差，难以沟通；13.1% 的游客被热门景点的汹涌人潮“劝退”；更有不少游客抱怨，在机场办理入境手续时陷入漫长的排队“拉锯战”，消磨了旅行热情。（刘雅婷）",

    "title": "Los trabajadores votan por una huelga masiva, pese al acuerdo propuesto por la dirección",
    "text": "Los maquinistas de las plantas de Seattle, que exigían un aumento salarial del 40 por ciento durante la vigencia del nuevo convenio colectivo, no consideraron satisfactoria la propuesta lograda por su sindicato. Otro golpe para Boeing. El fabricante de aviones estadounidense, que ya ha sufrido una serie de incidentes en los últimos meses, tendrá que hacer frente a una huelga masiva de sus maquinistas en su fábrica cercana a Seattle. Los aproximadamente 30.000 empleados de la región de Seattle, que trabajan en dos fábricas en las líneas de montaje del 737 en Renton y del 777 en Everett, votaron en un 96% a favor de una huelga masiva este jueves 12 de septiembre. Se espera que comiencen a salir a la medianoche, hora local, y paralicen la producción ya este viernes. El domingo se alcanzó un acuerdo entre la dirección y el poderoso sindicato IAM, que prevé, entre otras cosas, un aumento salarial del 25% durante la vigencia del nuevo convenio colectivo, una reducción del coste de la asistencia sanitaria y una reducción de las horas extraordinarias obligatorias. “El mejor contrato que hemos tenido jamás”El sindicato había instado a los empleados a aprobarlo. No se escuchó: los maquinistas exigían un aumento salarial de más del 40% y consideraban demasiado débiles los esfuerzos de la dirección. Ante el creciente descontento, el presidente del sindicato, Jon Holden, había reconocido a principios de semana “Piensa que [ses] Los miembros iban a votar por la huelga”.",
