THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jon Blacker Vladimir Guerrero Jr. had an RBI double in the fourth, then drove in two more runs in the fifth on a fielder’s choice, as the Blue Jays and Yankees traded leads. Clement’s basehit in the fourth also scored a runner and pinch-hitter Will Wagner plated Straw in the sixth.\nChris Bassitt (11-4) was solid for 7 1/3 innings, striking out eight and allowing four runs — three earned — on three hits and no walks. Relievers Justin Bruihl and Yariel Rodriguez preserved the win.\nAaron Judge’s two-run homer in the sixth tied the game 4-4 for New York (56-46), but that lead disappeared in the bottom of the inning thanks to Straw and Wagner’s RBIs. Jasson Dominguez had a home run in the second and Anthony Volpe added a solo shot in the fifth.\nAce Max Fried (11-4) struggled, giving up five runs — four earned — on six hits and three walks, striking out three over 5 1/3 innings.\nJonathan Loaisiga, Scott Effross and JT Brubaker all came out of the visitor’s bullpen, with Effross giving up two runs.\nTakeaways\nYankees: The long ball remains the key to success for New York, with all four of its runs coming from homers. The Yankees entered the game with a Major League Baseball-best 162 home runs, five more than the Los Angeles Dodgers. Shohei Ohtani had L.A.’s one homer in its 4-3 win over the Minnesota Twins earlier Wednesday.\nBlue Jays: Toronto benefited greatly from New York’s four errors and other fielding miscues, eking out runs on walks, dropped balls, wild pitches, and overthrows. Bichette’s two-run blast — his 13th home run of the year — was the Blue Jays’ cleanest score of the game as Guerrero had led off the inning with a double.\nKey moment\nDavis Schneider was caught stealing by Yankees catcher J.C. Escarra with one out in the fifth inning. A video replay overturned the call on the field, however. George Springer drew a walk in the next at bat and Guerrero drove them both home when Escarra dropped the ball trying to tag Schneider at the plate.\nKey stat\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Mike McIntyre | On Sports Thursdays\nKeep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter.\nSign up for Mike McIntyre | On Sports Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement .

    "text": "She’s not going to listen to this. Conway isn’t in the same party as Haley. This might as well be Yang, Manchin, or Biden giving her advice on how to run her campaign. Even if it is good advice.\nThe one consistent theme in all the “Not Trump” GOP candidates is that all of them are pretending they’re in some old normal world of campaigning. Where it’s a spirited contest between people who basically have the same policy goals but slightly different nuanced takes on which is more important or exactly how to achieve them. In that frame, they all think if/when they lose they can be a part of the administration the winner creates.\nThis is where all the concession and endorsements come from, looking to find their place in the eventual administration if their party wins even though it will not be them.\nExcept none of that is true for Trump. All of them mean nothing to Trump and no amount of groveling is going to repair that. His voters would never accept any of them. To those voters, Haley is in a different party. Clearly if she was in the real GOP she would just support Trump and be done.\nThe fantasy that there is one GOP is just a myth now. It’s the same reason the GOP House majority cannot do anything. It’s not really a majority, it’s a coalition of two minorities to create a majority and they don’t agree on much beyond the letters GOP.",
