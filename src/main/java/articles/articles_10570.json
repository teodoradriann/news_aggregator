    "title": "Piper Sandler reveals its top 3 biotech stock picks for 2024",
    "text": "Piper Sandler named three biotech stocks as its \"top picks\" for 2024 — citing attractive valuations and pipeline of product launches. The biotech sector has underperformed the S & P 500 index over the past two years, after being in the spotlight at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. But things are looking up: The sector is picking up and is expected to get a boost from interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve next year. \"After another difficult year, there are signs that biotech is recovering into 2024. A pause or even reversal in interest rate hikes is constructive for biotech financing and M & A (mergers & acquisitions) remains active,\" Piper Sandler's analysts Edward Tenthoff and Thad Barney wrote in a Dec. 22 note to investors. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Piper Sandler's analysts like Arrowhead , reiterating their overweight rating for the stock. They cited the company's plan to release phase 3 trial data for plozasiran for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome in mid-2024, and phase 3 trials for its use in severe hypertriglyceridemia, among other developments. It is also looking to do a cardiovascular outcome trial on either plozasiran or zodasiran to assess their impact on mortality and non-fatal strokes. Plozasiran and zodasiran are therapies targeting specific genes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids for energy production and other needs of the body. Data from analytics company GlobalData , shows that sales of plozasiran and zodasiran will hit $651 million by 2030, and $399 million by 2029 respectively. ARWR YTD mountain Year-to-date share price of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Year-to-date shares in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals were down nearly 20% to $31.03 on Dec. 27. Piper Sandler expects the company's trial pipeline to raise its stock price by 90% over the next 12 months to $59 a share. Legend Biotech Legend Biotech is another one of Piper Sandler's top picks. The investment bank said the pharmaceutical company's Carvykti drug — which is used to treat adults with bone marrow cancer — is \"the best in class,\" with \"demand far outpacing supply.\" Legend Biotech developed and commercialized the Carvykti drug with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Biotech. Piper Sandler expects Carvykti revenue to jump from $506 million in 2023 to $1.05 billion in 2024, and notes that Legend and Janssen are planning to increase global supply to 10,000 doses annually by the end of 2025. Peak revenue could exceed $5 billion, supported by the rise in production levels, according to the analysts. Aside from Carvykti, Legend is \"developing a rich pipeline\" of CAR-T Cell therapies for the treatment of different cancers, the analysts wrote. In line with this, the company announced a license agreement with Novartis last month to develop and commercialize cell therapies. LEGN YTD mountain Year-to-date shares in Legend Biotech Year-to-date shares in Legend Biotech were trading 20.5% up at $58.70. Piper Sandler expects shares to rise 53.3% to $90 over the next 12 months. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam also made Piper Sandler's list of top picks, given the potential of its phase 3 trials on Amvuttra — a drug used in the treatment of polyneuropathy, a condition that involves the simultaneous malfunction of nerves. Piper Sandler expects Amvuttra sales to jump from $550 million in 2023 to $1.13 billion in 2025. It also cited Alnylam's plans to make progress on drug trials and studies to treat patients with severe hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. ALNY YTD mountain Year-to-date shares in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Shares in Alnylam were down nearly 16% year-to-date to $196.57. Piper Sandler expects its share price to reach $217 in the next 12 months, giving it around 10.3% potential upside. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "title": "EU Austerity: 1 Million+ Preventable Deaths Linked",
    "text": "Austerity Measures Linked to Over 1.8 Million Preventable Deaths in Europe Europe’s commitment to fiscal austerity following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent economic challenges has come at a devastating human cost, according to a growing body of evidence. New data and analyses reveal a direct correlation between cuts to public health spending and a surge in preventable deaths across the European Union. Investigations suggest that over 1.8 million lives have been lost due to conditions that could have been avoided with adequate healthcare resources and social safety nets.\nThe European Commission recently reported that 1.1 million deaths across the EU are linked to avoidable conditions, highlighting the critical impact of socioeconomic factors on public health. This data underscores the fragility of health systems when faced with budgetary constraints. Simultaneously, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.8 million avoidable deaths occur annually in Europe due to chronic diseases. WHO Europe’s report emphasizes that many of these deaths are linked to preventable risk factors, such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and limited access to healthcare.\nThe Human Cost of Austerity: A Deeper Look The implementation of austerity measures – cuts in public spending designed to reduce government debt – has had a particularly severe impact on vulnerable populations. Reduced funding for healthcare, social services, and public health programs has led to longer waiting times for treatment, reduced access to essential medicines, and a decline in preventative care. This, in turn, has exacerbated existing health inequalities and contributed to a rise in preventable deaths.\nData from Eurostat reveals that avoidable chronic diseases are now Europe’s deadliest killers. Euractiv’s analysis of this data highlights the urgent need for increased investment in preventative healthcare and public health initiatives. The link between economic hardship and poor health outcomes is well-established, and austerity measures have only served to widen this gap.\nThe Peoples Dispatch reported that austerity policies are directly linked to over 1 million preventable deaths in the EU. Their investigation details how cuts to social programs and healthcare services have disproportionately affected low-income communities and marginalized groups.\nThe Star also reported on the WHO’s findings, emphasizing the scale of the crisis. This article serves as a stark reminder of the human consequences of prioritizing fiscal austerity over public health.\nWhat level of societal investment is truly necessary to safeguard public health and prevent future crises? And how can governments balance economic stability with the fundamental right to healthcare for all citizens?\nFrequently Asked Questions About Austerity and Preventable Deaths Pro Tip: Understanding the long-term consequences of austerity is crucial for informed policy-making and advocating for public health. What is austerity and how does it impact healthcare? Austerity refers to government policies aimed at reducing public spending. This often leads to cuts in healthcare budgets, resulting in reduced access to services, longer waiting times, and a decline in the quality of care. How many deaths are considered “preventable”? Preventable deaths are those that could have been avoided with timely and appropriate healthcare interventions, including preventative care, early diagnosis, and effective treatment. What role do social determinants of health play in preventable deaths? Social determinants of health – factors like income, education, housing, and access to healthy food – significantly influence health outcomes. Austerity measures often exacerbate these inequalities, leading to higher rates of preventable deaths among vulnerable populations. What can be done to mitigate the impact of austerity on public health? Investing in preventative healthcare, strengthening social safety nets, and prioritizing public health spending are crucial steps to mitigate the negative impacts of austerity. Is there a correlation between economic recessions and increased mortality rates? Yes, studies have shown a strong correlation between economic recessions and increased mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations. What is the WHO’s stance on the link between austerity and health outcomes? The WHO has consistently warned about the detrimental effects of austerity measures on public health, emphasizing the need for sustained investment in healthcare and social services. The evidence is clear: prioritizing fiscal austerity over public health has had devastating consequences for millions of Europeans. A renewed commitment to investing in healthcare, social services, and preventative care is essential to protect the health and well-being of all citizens.\nShare this article to raise awareness about the human cost of austerity and join the conversation in the comments below.\nDisclaimer: This article provides information for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical or financial advice.",

    "title": "Ottawa teen raced in socks to get help for friends who fell through ice: 911 caller",
    "text": "OTTAWA - It was about 9:30 p.m. when a young man came racing to her yard in his socks, a T-shirt and shorts. No coat. No phone. Dripping wet. \"He was yelling he needed help because his friend had fallen through the ice,\" says Carly Roome. She called the police right away, and she and her parents spoke with the boy, who was \"really shaken up,\" to get more details as she spoke to the 911 operator. The boy had pulled his sister out of the Rideau River, about 400 metres away from where Roome lives. But he was worried about those he was unable to save. The family drove the teenager back to the site, where his sister was waiting, and Roome passed her phone over to the teenager so he could provide more details about what happened. \"The sister was just, like, yelling, and just, like, really freaked out,\" Roome said. \"So I just held her while he was on the phone.\" Police confirmed Thursday morning that one teenager was dead. Another was still missing. You might be interested in Police said Thursday that emergency crews responded to a call about four teens falling into the river from Nicolls Island Road at 9:45 p.m. Police reported earlier that the first call came in at roughly 11:45 p.m., but later clarified that was a mistake. They said two of the teenagers were immediately rescued from the water and were taken to hospital by paramedics, while a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old boy were still missing and believed to be in the water. Police said a rescue operation took place in \"very difficult conditions,\" and included a surface and water search. Divers recovered the body of one of the missing teenagers. The search for the second missing teen was paused overnight and did not resume in the morning. Just before 3 p.m. on Thursday, an underwater search and recovery unit arrived on the scene and set up a tent near the edge of the river. Asked why the police press release implied that two teens were rescued when Roome's account suggests that one rescued himself and his sister, a police spokesperson noted that the release did not specify how the youths were rescued. \"I really feel for the boy that came to our house. He saved his sister and tried to save his friend,\" said Roome. \"And then in like no clothes ran to our house to get more help for his friend. I just really think he did everything that he could.\" Three marked police vehicles had been parked near the Long Island Locks of the Rideau Canal on a rainy Thursday morning, as milder-than-average temperatures persisted in Ottawa. Yellow police tape was wrapped around the locks near the river, where a thin layer of ice appeared to extend outward from the shore, met by open water. Police also taped off an area near the shoreline. Nearby, a black SUV was parked and blocked off with tape. The licence plates on the front and back of the vehicle were covered. Asked for more details, the police spokesperson said more information was not being shared because it remains an ongoing police operation. \"We have offered supports to the loved ones of the youths,\" an earlier police statement read. \"This tragedy affects us all.\" The search for the missing teen comes amid a spate of similar incidents across the country. RCMP in Alberta confirmed this week that a family of three died after falling through thin ice while riding their UTV in the lead-up to Christmas. The Mounties also said a man died after falling through ice near Calgary on Christmas Day. Last month, the RCMP in Saskatchewan reported that two girls fell through ice on a lake. One of them died, along with two men who were attempting a rescue. And in Quebec this week, provincial police said the search for a four-year-old girl who fell into a river last week is now being considered a recovery operation rather than a rescue mission. After the Prairies deaths, Mounties were reminding outdoor enthusiasts that ice should be at least 15 centimetres thick for a person to walk or skate on it. The thickness should be at least 20 centimetres for a group of people and 25 centimetres for the use of a snowmobile or off-road vehicle. Asked on Thursday whether Ottawa police had any message to the public about safety around ice, the spokesperson said the service's website points to advice from the Canadian Red Cross.

    "text": "Scalp micropigmentation, a revolutionary technique in the field of hair restoration, is gaining attention as a viable solution for those facing hair loss challenges. This method, distinct from traditional hair transplant surgery, offers an alternative approach for individuals seeking to address hair thinning and baldness. The process of scalp micropigmentation involves the application of pigment to the scalp, creating an illusion of fuller hair. Unlike hair transplant surgery, which typically involves grafting hair follicles to the balding areas, scalp micropigmentation is non-surgical and less invasive. It's a cosmetic procedure that replicates the appearance of hair follicles, providing a natural-looking hairline and adding density to thinning areas. The Growing Popularity of Scalp Micropigmentation Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of scalp micropigmentation. This rise can be attributed to its effectiveness in providing a solution to hair loss without the need for surgery. It's a versatile procedure that can benefit a wide range of individuals, including those with pattern baldness, alopecia, and thinning hair. Moreover, scalp micropigmentation can be used to conceal scars from previous hair transplants, enhancing the overall appearance of hair. To learn more about this procedure and to find reputable providers, interested individuals can go now to explore available options. Scalp Micropigmentation Versus Hair Transplants While hair transplants have been a long-standing solution for hair loss, scalp micropigmentation offers a unique set of advantages. It requires no surgery, meaning there is minimal recovery time and lower risk of complications. Additionally, the results are immediate, whereas hair transplants may take several months to show full results. Scalp micropigmentation is also cost-effective compared to the more expensive hair transplant procedures. Training and Expertise in Scalp Micropigmentation As the demand for scalp micropigmentation increases, so does the need for skilled practitioners. Training courses are becoming more prevalent, equipping individuals with the techniques and knowledge required to perform this delicate procedure. For instance, BrowMaster Launches Scalp Micropigmentation services and training courses in India , highlighting the global expansion of this technique. Courses like these offer comprehensive training, ensuring practitioners are well-versed in the intricacies of the procedure. The Role of Technology in Scalp Micropigmentation Technological advancements have played a significant role in the development of scalp micropigmentation, according to realtimecampaign.com. Modern equipment allows for precise application of pigment, ensuring a natural and seamless look. The pigments used have also been refined, offering a range of colors that match the individual's natural hair color. The Future of Hair Restoration Looking ahead, scalp micropigmentation is poised to become an increasingly popular choice for those seeking a solution to hair loss. Its non-invasive nature, coupled with the growing number of skilled practitioners, makes it an accessible and appealing option. It’s not just a cosmetic procedure but a form of artistry that requires skill and precision. For those considering scalp micropigmentation, it's important to consult with a qualified practitioner to discuss the best approach for their specific needs. Leading companies like Bosley are a testament to the growing interest and trust in these procedures. Scalp micropigmentation is a revolutionary technique offering a promising alternative to traditional hair transplant methods. Its rise in popularity is a testament to its effectiveness, affordability, and the natural-looking results it provides. As technology and training continue to evolve, scalp micropigmentation is set to play a pivotal role in the future of hair restoration solutions.
