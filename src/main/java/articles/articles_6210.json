The heavy downpour also affected domestic flight services after water leakage in terminal-2 of the KIA. Several main roads were under water, prompting police to redirect traffic to alternative routes. Slow-moving traffic was reported due to waterlogging on Chowdiah Road towards High Grounds Junction and on Ballari Road towards Hebbal due to waterlogging at Sanjaynagar Cross. The situation was worse near RR Nagar Arch on Mysuru Road, where flooding halted incoming traffic towards Nayandahalli, requiring it to be diverted towards Jnanabharathi campus.The overnight flooding primarily affected Terminal 2 (T2) of the airport, which handles most domestic flights. Videos circulating on social media showed water entering the terminal building, causing inconvenience to passengers and impacting flight operations.\"A very heavy downpour of rain within a short span of time on the evening of May 9, 2024, resulted in water leakage in certain areas of the terminals at Bengaluru airport,\" Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), which operates KIA, said in a statement.He said 13 domestic flights, three international passenger flights, and one international cargo flight were diverted to Chennai on Thursday.\"Our teams promptly responded to the situation to mitigate the impact and restore normal operations.

The Leopards improved to 9-4 after the game, tying the New Taipei CTBC DEA atop the five-team T1 LEAGUE on the back of a franchise-record five-game winning streak. The 6,015 spectators who turned up for Cousin’s debut also set a new attendance record for the Leopards at the Taoyuan Arena, the franchise’s home since last summer. Cousins logged 13 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals, and one block in 28:24 on the floor — a performance the four-time NBA All-Star suggested he could exceed with adequate rest. “I’m jet-lagged; I just got off a 14-hour flight. I’ll get some recovery after this game, get my legs fresh, and be ready for tomorrow. So hopefully, it’s a better performance,” the 33-year-old center said after the game.\nUdonis Haslem spent 20 seasons wearing a Miami Heat jersey. Now, his jersey will forever hang from the rafters in the Heat’s home arena. During a halftime ceremony in the middle of Friday night’s game between the Heat and Atlanta Hawks at Kaseya Center, Haslem’s No. 40 jersey was retired by the organization. Haslem, 43, became the sixth Heat player to have his jersey retired, joining Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n“Look at the list of the guys I’m sitting with,” Haslem said, referring to the first five Heat players who had their jerseys retired and are already in the Basketball Hall of Fame. “That’s what’s huge to me.That’s what makes me feel so amazing is the core group of guys that I’m sitting with. Pat Riley ain’t just putting anybody up there. The Arisons ain’t just OK’ing anybody to go up in those rafters.”\nHaslem, who was born at Miami’s North Shore Medical Center and grew up in Liberty City before playing at Miami High, then dedicated a part of his speech to his hometown of Miami — the area code 305.\n“Liberty City, Overtown, Little Havana, Little Haiti, everybody, tonight when this jersey goes up in the rafters, all of y’all coming with me,” Haslem said during the speech.“The love y’all show me in this city, I love you guys, I appreciate you guys. …. 305, you got to hold it up. You got to hold up the 305. Tonight, we all celebrate, 305.” Even though Haslem’s playing career is over and his Heat jersey is now retired, he’ll remain around the organization.The Heat hired him as the vice president of basketball development in November and he still hopes to become part of the Heat’s ownership group one day. “To be able to get out, make it, excel and succeed, I hope it’s a great example for other kids in Miami, in Liberty City and for my kids, as well,” Haslem said. “… This is a dream come true.”\nJanuary 20, 2024 | 10:28 am EST Update\n<a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/rumor/wizards-to-sign-trey-jemison/\">\nWizards sign Trey Jemison </a>\nShams Charania: The Washington\nWizards plan to sign center Trey Jemison to a 10-day contract out of the NBA G League’s Birmingham Squadronsources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.

Prison Legal News, a monthly publication that covers criminal justice-related news and litigation nationwide, [sued](http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/10/13/prison%20legal%20news%20complaint.pdf) the Walton County Jail in Monroe, Ga., Sheriff Joe Chapman, and Jail Commander Wade Harris in September 1992, after they instituted a postcard-only mail policy. The jail typically houses about 350 inmates at any given time, and the policy essentially gave teeth to an already existing ban on publications and periodicals of all kinds. \"The Jail's policies and practices do not afford prisoners or their correspondents adequate notice of nor an opportunity to challenge improper mail censorship or rejection,\" the complaint filed by Prison Legal News' publisher, Human Rights Defense Center, said. After a bench trial, Chief U.S. District Judge c. Ashley Royal held that while the jail's postcard-only policy passed judicial muster, the resulting publication ban was unconstitutional. But the ruling left no one declaring victory. Afterwards, Lance Webber, counsel for Human Rights Defense Center, told Courthouse News, \"This means that PLN cannot notify its subscribers at the Walton County jail about the disposition of the case by providing them with a copy of the attached ruling unless PLN were to print out the ruling on multiple postcards or write an article about the case result and deliver the information through the pages of its magazine. \"I think that this means that the prisoners are effectively banned from reading this ruling, unless it were to be sent to a prisoner via legal mail from an attorney.\" Jail Commander Wade Harris told Courthouse News that the publication ban was in place when he took command in 2005. \"I started doing some research at that time and found that courts had ruled that this policy was unconstitutional. We started working on our anti-publication policy to figure out how to address that,\" he said. \"We were already working on the anti-publication policy when PLN filed the lawsuit,\" he added. The postcard-only policy was implemented at Walton County Jail in 2010. \"It sounded like a really good idea because we wouldn't be restricting the inmates to only writing X amount of postcards or letters,\" said Harris. \"A lot of times correspondence contains information we would need to know about, such as security breaches and contraband. Inmates are less likely to put contraband on a postcard,\" he continued. \"I thought it was a really good idea so we implemented the post-card only policy in 2010. We don't want to keep them from talking to people on the outside.\" \"It is undisputed that participation in educational activities behind bars is directly related to lower rates of recidivism among released prisoners. Reading is a fundamental part of education,\" Weber told Courthouse News. \"It is also undisputed that prisoners who maintain personal connections with friends and family are less likely to return to prison or jail once released, than those who do not regularly communicate with their friends and family,\" he said. \"Unnecessarily restrictive mail policies like Sheriff Chapman's postcard-only mail policy are bad for public safety because they contribute to higher recidivism rates.\"",

    "text": "28 dez, 2023 - 17:52 • [Teresa Paula Costa](https://rr.sapo.pt/artigo/33588/teresa-paula-costa) com redação O IVA Zero no cabaz de bens alimentares essenciais teve impacto positivo na vida das pessoas, disse esta quinta-feira o economista João Duque. Em declarações à Renascença, João Duque afirmou que “não há a mínima dúvida de que houve um benefício” para as pessoas, dado que “os intermediários, a rede de retalho, ficaram mesmo com IVA Zero”. Contudo, “com o evoluir dos preços durante o ano, esse benefício rapidamente foi comido e as pessoas acabam por não sentir, porque, na prática, também não era muito significativo o valor do IVA Zero, porque se aplicava a produtos em que o IVA já era muito baixo em muitos casos”, explicou. Isso justifica a perceção das pessoas de que a medida introduzida pelo Governo não resultou. Os consumidores reconhecem o benefício de IVA Zero(...) Questionado sobre o comportamento dos consumidores neste final de ano, o economista não se mostrou surpreendido. “Sinceramente, acho que era de esperar, porque os aumentos salariais da maior parte dos portugueses ocorreram muito no início do ano de 2023, e a inflação continua a fazer sentir-se durante todo o ano e, portanto, vamos tendo cada vez menos folga”, explicou. Por outro lado, “em cima da inflação, há um problema que afeta muitos portugueses que, de facto, foi o aumento das taxas de juro e o acréscimo muito significativo dos valores que pagam mensalmente para amortização do capital de juros”. Tendo também em conta “o facto das poupanças feitas durante a pandemia já se terem ido por outras vias“, os portugueses debatem-se com falta de dinheiro e esperam que “no próximo mês, mesmo com o IVA aumentado, talvez os aumentos salariais e as atualizações salariais de que venham a beneficiar, possam compensar”. Sobre a possibilidade de virem a ser criados outros apoios, o economista disse acreditar que sim, mas “para os que mais necessitam.”",

In a resolution adopted at its national council meeting here, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) noted that the country is passing through the “most difficult” phase since independence as the BJP-led Centre is moving towards “dictatorship”. [Nitish Kumar elected JD(U) president](/nitish-kumar-elected-jdu-president-2944388/) “Fear, hatred and frenzy are being created in society. Politics has started taking the form of deceit and revenge,” it said, alleging that all this is the result of the deeds of the BJP government which is in power at the Centre. “This is the biggest threat to our democracy and the Constitution. The central government is moving towards dictatorship. The constitutional institutions and federal structure of the country are being weakened,” the resolution read. In the last nine years, this situation has worsened and taken a “horrible shape”, it said, alleging that the BJP-led Centre is not paying attention to the problems of the people and raising “false slogans” to deflect the common people’s attention from the problems. “At a time when the entire opposition is talking about saving the Constitution framed by Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the BJP is raising the issue of Sanatan,” the Nitish Kumar-led party charged. “We all respect Sanatan culture, values, traditions and its ideals. There is no opposition anywhere on this. But when we raise the issue of the BJP government curtailing the rights of backward classes, Dalits, tribals and minorities guaranteed under the Constitution, then suddenly they remember Sanatan,” it said. The reality is that the BJP has “hidden” ‘Manusmriti’ under the cloak of Sanatan, it added. “They want that India should not be governed on the basis of Baba Saheb’s Constitution, rather the governance and social system should be governed on the basis of ‘Manusmriti’. This is the secret agenda of BJP,” the JD-U resolution charged.",

    "text": "Trois personnes soupçonnées d’être impliquées dans un réseau islamiste ont été arrêtées en Autriche, ont annoncé dimanche les autorités qui ont dit avoir renforcé la sécurité autour des églises et marchés de Noël en raison d’un «risque accru». «Intervenant sur un réseau islamiste», les autorités autrichiennes ont arrêté quatre personnes samedi, a indiqué le ministère de l’Intérieur. Un porte-parole du ministère a ensuite indiqué que parmi ces quatre, trois restaient détenues dans l’attente d’investigations complémentaires.\n«Risque accru» Citant «un risque accru», la police a par ailleurs renforcé les contrôles, notamment autour des églises, cérémonies religieuses et marchés de Noël à Vienne. «Il n’y a pas de menace immédiate d’attaque à Vienne», a néanmoins précisé le porte-parole de la police.\nSamedi, la police autrichienne avait indiqué dans un communiqué que «des agents terroristes en Europe appellent à mener des attaques contre des évènements chrétiens, spécialement autour du 24 décembre».\nMenace sur l’Europe Selon le site du quotidien allemand Bild samedi, des services de sécurité en Autriche, Allemagne et Espagne ont reçu des indications selon lesquelles un groupe islamiste voudrait commettre plusieurs attentats en Europe possiblement à la Saint-Sylvestre et à Noël.\nSelon le journal, les cibles de ces attentats pourraient être des messes de Noël à Cologne, Vienne et Madrid. Il affirme également qu’une personne a été arrêtée en Allemagne. D’après Bild, les personnes arrêtées sont des Tadjiks soupçonnés d’avoir voulu perpétrer des attaques au nom de l’État islamique au Khorassan (EI-K), branche locale de l’EI en Afghanistan.\nDes fouilles avec des chiens renifleurs ont été effectuées samedi soir par la police dans la cathédrale de Cologne, suite à un «avis de danger» émis pour la Saint-Sylvestre, mais que les autorités ont également pris en considération pour Noël. Rien de suspect n’a été découvert.\nEn juillet, une cellule d’islamistes présumés de l’EI-K avait été démantelée en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas. Les personnes arrêtées en Allemagne étaient soupçonnées de vouloir commettre une attaque dans le pays.\nAFP\nVous avez trouvé une erreur?\n0 commentaires",
