    "text": "Good Samaritans help save 2 men from drowning in water\nBy Dani Miskell\nClick here for updates on this story\nSAN DIEGO (\nKGTV) — Two men are lucky to be alive after somehow falling off Sunset Cliffs early Thursday morning.\nThe men were rescued not only by San Diego Lifeguards but also by good Samaritans who happened to be at the right place at the right time.\nThose good Samaritans told ABC 10News that around 1 a.m. they heard the two men screaming in the water and fighting for their lives, so they immediately took action.\nOne of the Samaritans called 911, while the other jumped into the ocean to help with the rescue.\nWitness Zachary Mallak said, “They were getting smashed in the waves and they were dropped into the cave. And when they were brought into the cave, they didn’t respond. So, they could have gotten stuck there for days; like, who knows what would have happened.”\nRyan Miller, who dove into the waters to help with the rescue, said he was certified at a surf school in Hawaii, so he knew exactly what to do.\n“They were dying,” Miller said. “They were going to die if no one came in, so what was I going to do? Sit there and watch?”\nABC 10News photojournalist Paul Anderegg captured the dramatic moments as Miller helped San Diego Fire-Rescue crews get the two men onto surfboards and out of the water.\nOne of the victims who fell in is seen in the video wearing a white T-shirt, and he, along with his friend, were helped up the cliffs where medics rendered aid.\nSarah Hulbert, another witness at the scene and one of the locals who tried helping the two men in the water, said many came to help in the nick of time before rescue crews arrived.\n“They were throwing surfboards over and trying to get everybody out as safely as possible, and it was honestly amazing,” Hulbert said.\nOn Thursday, San Diego Fire-Rescue’s Newsworthy Incident Fact Sheet showed the rescue transpired in just 90 minutes.\nUpdate: The fact sheet was updated Thursday stating that the two men jumped off the cliffs.\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue Department\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "title": "Holi heat on North India",
    "text": "Highlighting a concerning trend amidst the threat of climate change, a study has said there is a growing probability of temperatures soaring to as high as 40 degrees Celsius during late March, coinciding with the Holi celebration, in at least nine States, including States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Bihar. Maharashtra currently exhibits the highest probability at 14 per cent while among the cities, Bilaspur has the highest risk with a 31 percent chance of reaching 40 degrees Celsius, which is 2.5 times higher than in the 1970s. Such a scenario, which was once considered rare, underscores the escalating impact of climate change on weather patterns and cultural festivities, particularly during the festival of colours, traditionally celebrated amidst the onset of spring. The report from Climate Central, a US-based group of scientists comes days after the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast that the country is likely to experience warmer summer this year, with above normal day and night temperatures from March till May over most parts of the country due to El Nino conditions, except over some isolated areas of northwest, northeast, central and peninsular India. Predicting the warm weather, the US-based researchers too pointed out that States that will be impacted by extreme heat waves will be Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. Citywise, said the study, a total of 37 cities now have at least a 1 per cent chance of experiencing extreme heat, with 11 cities having a probability exceeding 10 per cent. To show this change, the researchers calculated the difference between the warming rates in March and April, expressed as the change in average temperature since 1970. On regional impact, the study said, the warming trend is observed across all of India, particularly in March and April, with central regions experiencing the fastest changes. With the exception of Madurai, the 15 cities with the highest risk of experiencing temperatures above 4 degrees Celsius are in central India, the analysis showed. Climate Central said March and April are warming across India. During March, the northern and western regions have the fastest warming, with the largest change since 1970 in March occurring in Jammu and Kashmir (2.8 degrees Celsius). Warming is more uniform in April and Mizoram has the largest change since 1970 (1.9 degrees Celsius). “There has been an abrupt transition in the temperatures from cool winter-like temperatures to much warmer conditions now. “After the strong warming trend observed in February, March is also likely to follow the same pattern. These warming trends in India are a clear sign of the impacts of human-led climate change,” said Andrew Pershing, VP for Science, Climate Central. The authors also emphasised the role of human-led climate change in the escalating temperatures. Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather corroborates this, stating that climate change is the driving force behind soaring temperatures and warns of more frequent heatwaves and intense summers. The report also mentioned global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. It highlighted the urgency to limit further temperature rise to prevent worsening climate impacts. Global average temperatures have risen by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1850, with greenhouse gas levels reaching record highs in 2023.",

After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases.\nKent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police.\nThe suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter.\nInvestigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars.\n\"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "title": "Ex-Wagner mercenaries may be heading back to Ukraine, but this time with Russia’s National Guard, intel says",
    "text": "- Russia's national guard is integrating former Wagner Group fighters into a volunteer formation.\n- Britain's defense ministry said Rosgvardia will likely deploy these fighters to Ukraine or Africa.\n- It's the latest effort by Moscow to clamp down on the ruthless mercenary organization.\nFormer Wagner Group mercenaries are being absorbed into Russia's national guard and may soon be deployed to Ukraine, according to Western intelligence, as Moscow continues to assume control over the ruthless mercenary organization.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in late-December authorized the country's National Guard, also known as Rosgvardia, to create its own volunteer arrangements. Now, the force is integrating three former Wagner assault detachments into its first Volunteer Corps formation, Britain's defense ministry said in a Thursday intelligence\nupdate.\n\"Rosgvardia will likely deploy its new volunteer detachments to Ukraine and Africa,\" Britain's defense ministry said, and is \"reportedly offering volunteers six-month contracts for service in Ukraine, and nine-month contracts for service in Africa.\" Russia has long maintained a security presence throughout the continent to serve its foreign policy aspirations.\n\"The incorporation of former Wagner assault detachments into Rosgvardia's volunteer corps highly likely indicates that Wagner has been successfully subordinated to Rosgvardia, increasing the Russian state's command and control over the Wagner group,\" Britain's defense ministry added.\nRosgvardia, which was created in 2016 and\nresembles a sort of internal security agency, is often referred to as Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"private army\" because it reports only to him.\nThe national guard, led by\nGen. Viktor Zolotov, did little to stop the heavily armed Wagner Group columns from invading Russia during its short-lived rebellion in June, and in the aftermath Rosgvardia asked Putin for armored vehicles and other military equipment under the premise that it would help improve security at the borders.\nIn August, the Russian president signed a law allowing Rosgvardia to be equipped with\nheavy weaponry. Some in the West observed this as an effort to strengthen the national guard.\n\"With Zolotov previously suggesting that heavy equipment should include artillery and attack helicopters, the move suggests that the Kremlin is doubling down on resourcing Rosgvardia as one of the key organizations to ensure regime security,\" Britain's defense ministry wrote of the development in an early August intelligence\nhttps://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1688789574552596480?s=20.\nBy the end of the year, Rosgvardia had established a footprint inside Russian-held regions of Ukraine. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War\nsaid in December that Moscow appeared to be using the national guard to expand its control over this occupied territory without having to rely on front-line troops.\nThis new development also marks the latest chapter in Wagner's\ndownfall, which went from being a feared force fighting independently in Ukraine to becoming subsumed by the Russian state. The mercenaries played a key role in the months-long battle for Bakhmut; their efforts were characterized by gruesome human wave tactics at a cost of tens of thousands of lives.\nAfter the failed mutiny, and later the death of the organization's founder\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the Kremlin moved to assume more control over the mercenaries, especially in Africa — where they used to operate in several countries as a shadowy extension of the Kremlin. Over the past few years they have been accused of committing various atrocities and human rights violations there.\nA new Russian military formation called the Africa Corps — which has the same name as a Nazi unit — is even\ntrying to recruit former Wagner mercenaries for combat operations across the continent.

    "title": "Fasting Mimicking Diet: Lose Stubborn Belly Fat in Just 5 Days!",
    "text": "Living\nFasting Mimicking Diet: Lose Stubborn Belly Fat in Just 5 Days!\nIntermittent fasting comes in many forms, which makes it a great method for flexibility that can be tailored to your personal weight loss and health goals. And if you’re looking to shrink your waist, the fasting mimicking diet plan might be right for you. It’s designed specifically to reduce visceral belly fat, the harmful type that surrounds the internal organs. Here, experts reveal the weight loss benefits of a fasting mimicking diet and how to enhance results.\nWhat is the fasting mimicking diet?\nThe fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is a short-term, low-calorie, plant-based dietary protocol designed to mimic the effects of water-only fasting while still providing small amounts of food, explains Helen Messier, MD, Chief Medical and Science Officer at Fountain Life.\n“Typically done for three to five days, the diet is low in protein and carbohydrates, moderate in healthy fats and keeps caloric intake around 700–1,100 calories per day,” says Dr. Messier. “It’s structured to avoid activating nutrient-sensing pathways, which allows the body to stay in a ‘fasted’ cellular state despite nutrient intake.”\nHow fasting mimicking promotes weight loss\nFMD works by inducing a mild state of ketosis, which occurs when your body begins burning fat as an energy source, says Dr. Messier, adding that it also helps improve insulin sensitivity.\n“Since it restricts calories and proteins, it downregulates metabolic pathways that drive fat storage while preserving lean muscle,” she explains. “It also lowers inflammation and helps reprogram metabolism at a cellular level—particularly by triggering autophagy (cellular cleanup) and stem cell activation during the refeeding period.”\nHow much weight can you lose with FMD?\nWeight loss varies based on your current body composition and metabolic health, says Dr. Messier. In clinical trials, participants commonly lose five to eight pounds of body weight per fasting mimicking diet cycle. “A significant portion of this is fat mass, especially visceral fat,” she notes. “However, the real benefit lies in metabolic resetting, not just scale numbers.”\nHow to follow the fasting mimicking diet\nFMD is usually followed for five consecutive days per month, adds Trista Best, RD at Balance One Supplements. People generally start with about 1,100 calories on day one, followed by 750–800 calories on days two through five.\nThe types of food included in FMD are mostly plant-based, including healthy fats and non-starchy vegetables, says Best. Here are the specific foods she recommends including (and avoiding) on the FMD.\nFoods to eat:\n- Zucchini\n- Kale\n- Spinach\n- Arugula\n- Broccoli\n- Cauliflower\n- Cabbage\n- Celery\n- Cucumber\n- Olives and olive oil\n- Avocados\n- Macadamia nuts\n- Walnuts (small quantities)\n- Almonds (small quantities)\n- Chia or flax seeds (sparingly)\n- Tomatoes (small servings)\n- Berries (small servings)\n- Lemon/lime (for flavoring)\nFoods to avoid:\n- Bread, rice, pasta\n- Potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn\n- Beans, lentils (in large amounts)\n- Grains (unless very small amounts like quinoa)\n- Fruit juices\n- Dried fruits\n- Sweets, desserts, honey\n- Added sugars or sweeteners (even natural ones)\n- Processed snacks or fast food\n- Refined oils (canola, soybean)\n- Artificial flavors, preservatives\nHow FMD compares to other forms of fasting\nSo, how does FMD stack up against more common types of intermittent fasting like the 16:8 schedule or prolonged water fasts? According to Messier, FMD offers a safer, more sustainable option, particularly for people who may struggle with nutrient deficiencies or blood sugar instability.\n“It provides many of the same health benefits as fasting—reduced inflammation, improved glucose control, cellular rejuvenation—without total food deprivation,” she says, making it a top option for consistency.\nNow, this doesn’t necessarily guarantee that the fasting mimicking diet is suitable for everyone. While generally considered safe, Dr. Messier cautions that it may not be appropriate if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, have a history of disordered eating, are taking insulin or certain medications or are underweight or frail.\n“It’s essential that people with chronic medical conditions consult with a healthcare provider before trying it, especially if they’re already on medications that regulate blood sugar or blood pressure,” she adds.\nCopyright 2025 A360 Media\nThis story was originally published April 23, 2025 at 5:30 PM.",

    "text": "Edwin Arrieta: Así era el cirujano presuntamente asesinado por Daniel Sancho Mejores series de ficción sobre crímenes reales en streaming El caso de Daniel Sancho, clavado a una serie de HBO Salen a la luz los mensajes entre Daniel Sancho e Edwin Arrieta horas antes de la muerte del cirujano. El hijo de Rodolfo Sancho , que dio plantón a sus compañeros en la presentación en México de 'Zorro' , su nueva serie que ya se puede ver en Prime Video y llega a RTVE en los próximos días, confesó que era el culpable de la desaparición del colombiano, admitiendo además que lo había descuartizado en la isla tailandesa donde residían. Sin embargo, la defensa del acusado ha insistido en las últimas semanas que este no fue el caso, acusando a los cuerpos de seguridad de engañar a Sancho.\nEl programa 'En boca de todos' tenía la oportunidad de acceder al sumario del caso, publicando una serie de mensajes de WhatsApp en donde se puede ver la conversación que mantuvieron el cocinero y el cirujano horas antes del trágico suceso. Sancho habría enviado incluso varios mensaje después de la muerte del colombiano, lo que se desconoce si fue un movimiento estratégico o una demostración de inocencia por su parte.\ncuatro \"Está lloviendo\", le escribía Arrieta. \"Mazo, tenemos que esperar un poco para movernos, nos tomamos algo aquí. Koh Pangan te va a recibir abriéndose el cielo\" , eran las inmediatas palabras de Daniel Sancho. “Sí, son bendiciones”, replicaba el cirujano en su siguiente contestación. “Ya estoy aquí esperando porque supuestamente llegabas en 20 minutos”, escribía el cocinero, preguntándose dónde estaba su compañero. Edwin decidió dar una vuelta antes, algo que no sentó muy bien al joven. \"Ah, fenomenal, llegas y te vas a hacer un plan tú solo y yo aquí esperándote en el puerto\". \"Jajaja, eres un enojón, jajaja”, replicaba Arrieta.\nTras esos mensajes, el cirujano ya no volvió a contestar y era Daniel Sancho el que escribía: “Estoy muy, muy preocupado, hace horas que no te veo. Llevabas todas tus cosas, la plata, el móvil, voy a tener que llamar a la policía”, decía el mensaje posterior a la muerte de Edwin.\n En portada Ana Rosa Quintana sale\nAnne Igartiburu: su propósito para el nuevo año\nClaudia Osborne: su primer paseo siendo cuatro\nAl descubierto los planes de boda de Urdangarin\n Carmen Cervera revela el nombre de su heredera\nToñi Moreno, destrozada, pide perdón a una joven\nCharlene cumple 46 años y vuelve a sonreír\nTita desvela por qué no se casó con Julio Iglesias\nCharlene de Mónaco cumple 46: su vida en imágenes\nMáximo habla de su nuevo libro y de su madre\nAsí es Enric Auquer, nuevo amor de Macarena García\nRodolfo Sancho, ausente en un acto de trabajo\n ",
