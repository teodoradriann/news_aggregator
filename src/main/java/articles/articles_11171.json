    "title": "Meta entrenó uno de los modelos Llama con obras pirateadas de LibGen",
    "text": "MADRID, 10 Ene. (Portaltic/EP) - Meta ha entrenado al menos uno de sus modelos de lenguaje de gran tamaño (LLM, por sus siglas en inglés) con obras protegidas con derechos de autor mediante el recurso de una biblioteca con contenidos pirateados. Library Genesis o LibGen es un motor de búsqueda que facilita el acceso a obras impresas, como novelas, cómics o artículos científicos, que ha sido denunciado en numerosas ocasiones por infringir los derechos de autor. Se vio obligado a cerrar su dominio en Estados Unidos por orden judicial en 2015, y también ha sido bloqueado en varios países europeos, pero sigue estando disponible mediante dominios alternativos. A partir de este motor de búsqueda, Meta ha entrenado al menos uno de los LLM Llama con obras pirateadas, como se recoge en nuevos documentos no redactados presentados ante el Tribunal de Distrito de los Estados Unidos para el Distrito Norte de California. Estos documentos respaldan la denuncia interpuesta por el novelista Richard Kadrey contra Meta por infracción de derechos de autor, y recogen el testimonio de un representante corporativo que testificó en noviembre de 2024, en el que se reconoce el uso de LibGen. Según los documentos, fue el director ejecutivo, Mark Zuckerberg, quien autorizó el uso de este motor de búsqueda para descargar obras mediante torrent con las que entrenar su modelos, pese a las preocupaciones de miembros del equipos de Meta AI. En concreto, Meta retiró la información de derechos de autor de la base de datos de LibGen, precisamente la que contiene material pirateado de editoriales como Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill y Pearson Education. También eliminó de artículos científicos los párrafos con derechos de autor y la fuente de los metadatos de los datos de entrenamiento de Llama, incluida la información sobre gestión de derechos de autor (CMI, por sus siglas en inglés), como el signo de la 'c' que indica copyright, lo que facilitó el entrenamiento, pero también evitó que saltaran las alarmas entre los usuarios del modelo si aparecía dicho contenido en las interacciones. Una investigación de The New York Times, publicada en abril del año pasado, reveló que Meta, así como Google y OpenAI, entrenaban sus modelos con contenidos procedentes de Internet, incluidos vídeos procedentes de YouTube.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "Icy road woes for dirt roads\n“The snow is melting and once it gets nighttime or later in the day, temperatures start dropping even more and now we’re going to start having ice on the roads”\nLANSING, Mich. (WILX) - The weather has made it a challenge to keep dirt roads in tip-top shape.\n“The snow is melting and once it gets nighttime or later in the day, temperatures start dropping even more and now we’re going to start having ice on the roads,” said Lieutenant Rene Gonzalez with Michigan State Police.\nOn Tuesday, the Clinton County Road Commission took to Facebook to express how tough it is to maintain the gravel roads during cold temperatures and warn people to expect potential delays.\n“The main thing we tell drivers is don’t panic if you start losing control of your vehicle, but a lot of people have an instinct of just hitting the brake once you apply that brake you lose control of your vehicle completely,” said Lieutenant Gonzalez.\nOn dirt roads, it can be even scarier. Gravel roads are extremely slippery due to a lack of traction, but adding a layer of ice exacerbates the problem.\n“If you lose control of your vehicle, take your foot off the gas, do not apply the brake, steer your vehicle in the location that you want to go to, and look at that location then you’re going to start feeling your vehicle starts to gain control, you’re going to feel those tires grab, and then slowly accelerate out of the spin,” said Lieutenant Gonzalez.\nSubscribe to our\n[News 10 newsletter](https://www.wilx.com/newsletter/) and [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@wilxtv) to receive the latest local news and weather.
