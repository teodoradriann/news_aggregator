    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted.

They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.

    "title": "Can’t Get My HP ENVY PRO 6455e Back on WiFi",
    "text": "The HP ENVY PRO 6455e is a reliable all-in-one printer designed to handle everyday printing, scanning, and copying needs. However, it’s not immune to connectivity problems, especially when trying to reconnect to Wi-Fi after a network change, router update, or other disruptions. If you’re struggling to get your hp envy 6455e connect to wifi , this comprehensive guide will walk you through the common causes and provide actionable solutions to restore connectivity.\nUnderstanding Wi-Fi Connectivity Issues Before troubleshooting, it’s important to understand why your printer may not reconnect to Wi-Fi:\nNetwork Changes : If your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) or password has been updated, the printer will need to be reconfigured. Outdated Printer Settings : Previous configurations might interfere with new connections. Compatibility Issues : The HP ENVY PRO 6455e only supports 2.4 GHz networks, so a 5 GHz-only router setup won’t work. Wi-Fi Setup Mode Not Activated : The printer must be in setup mode to reconnect to Wi-Fi. Interference or Signal Issues : Weak or unstable signals can disrupt the connection. Firmware Problems : Outdated printer firmware can cause connectivity challenges. Read More: 123.hp/setup\nStep-by-Step Troubleshooting 1. Reset the Printer’s Network Settings If your printer is still configured for an old network, resetting its network settings is the first step.\nHow to Reset Network Settings : Ensure the printer is turned on. Press and hold the Wireless button and the Cancel button simultaneously for 5 seconds. The Wi-Fi light will start blinking, indicating that the settings have been reset and the printer is now in Wi-Fi setup mode. 2. Activate Wi-Fi Setup Mode After resetting, the printer must enter Wi-Fi setup mode to reconnect to a network.\nSteps to Activate Wi-Fi Setup Mode : Press and hold the Wireless button until the blue light starts blinking. The blinking light confirms that the printer is ready to connect to Wi-Fi. 3. Use the HP Smart App for Reconnection The HP Smart app is the most efficient way to connect your HP ENVY PRO 6455e to Wi-Fi.\nSteps Using the HP Smart App : Download the HP Smart app on your smartphone or computer if you haven’t already. Open the app and enable Bluetooth on your device. Add your printer by following the on-screen instructions. Select your Wi-Fi network and enter the password. The app will complete the setup process and reconnect the printer to your network. 4. Check Your Router Settings Certain router configurations may block the printer from connecting to Wi-Fi.\nWhat to Check : Network Band : Ensure the 2.4 GHz band is enabled, as the printer doesn’t support 5 GHz networks. SSID (Wi-Fi Name) : Ensure the network is visible. MAC Address Filtering : Disable this feature or add the printer’s MAC address to the allowed list. Connected Devices Limit : Make sure your router hasn’t reached its maximum device limit. 5. Update Printer Firmware Firmware updates can resolve bugs and improve connectivity.\nSteps to Update Firmware : Connect the printer to your computer using a USB cable if it’s not already connected to Wi-Fi. Visit the official HP website and download the latest firmware for the HP ENVY PRO 6455e. Follow the on-screen instructions to update the firmware. 6. Restart All Devices Restarting your printer, router, and the device you’re using for setup can resolve temporary glitches.\nSteps : Turn off your printer, router, and computer or smartphone. Wait for one minute. Turn on the router first, then the printer, and finally the setup device. Attempt the connection process again. 7. Use WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) If the HP Smart app isn’t working, WPS is a convenient alternative for connecting the printer to Wi-Fi.\nSteps to Use WPS : Press and hold the Wireless button on the printer until it blinks. Press the WPS button on your router within two minutes. Wait for the printer’s wireless light to turn solid, indicating a successful connection. Advanced Troubleshooting If the basic steps don’t resolve the issue, consider these advanced methods:\n1. Assign a Static IP Address Assigning a static IP address can help eliminate network conflicts.\nHow to Assign a Static IP : Access your router’s settings through a web browser (typically by entering 192.168.1.1 or a similar IP). Locate the DHCP settings and assign a static IP address to the printer. Reconnect the printer using the HP Smart app or WPS. 2. Factory Reset the Printer A factory reset can resolve persistent issues by restoring the printer to its original settings.\nSteps for Factory Reset : Turn off the printer. Press and hold the Power button and the Cancel button for 10 seconds. Release the buttons and restart the printer. 3. Verify Firewall and Antivirus Settings Firewall or antivirus software on your setup device may block the printer connection.\nWhat to Do : Temporarily disable the firewall or antivirus during the setup process. Re-enable the security software after the printer is successfully connected. Preventing Future Connectivity Problems 1. Maintain Router Placement Place the printer and router in an open, central location for optimal signal strength.\n2. Document Wi-Fi Credentials Keep your Wi-Fi password and other credentials handy to simplify reconnection processes.\n3. Update Regularly Periodically update both your printer firmware and router software to ensure compatibility.\n4. Limit Network Changes If possible, avoid frequently changing your Wi-Fi network name or password to minimize disruptions.\nFAQs Q1: Why is my HP ENVY PRO 6455e not showing in the HP Smart app? Ensure the printer is in Wi-Fi setup mode and that Bluetooth is enabled on your setup device.\nQ2: How do I know if my router supports 2.4 GHz networks? Check your router’s specifications or access its settings to confirm the availability of the 2.4 GHz band.\nQ3: Can I use the printer without Wi-Fi? Yes, you can connect the printer to your computer via a USB cable or use Wi-Fi Direct for wireless printing without a router.\nQ4: What should I do if the WPS method doesn’t work? Ensure your router supports WPS and that the feature is enabled in the router’s settings.\nQ5: How long does Wi-Fi setup mode remain active? Wi-Fi setup mode remains active for two hours after resetting the printer’s network settings.\nConclusion Getting your HP ENVY PRO 6455e back on Wi-Fi can be challenging, but with the right steps, you can quickly resolve the issue. From resetting network settings and using the HP Smart app to troubleshooting router configurations and updating firmware, this guide provides comprehensive solutions. By following these steps, you’ll restore your printer’s connectivity and enjoy seamless wireless printing once again.",

    "text": "Amélie Oudéa-Castéra se refirió a los incidentes con los hinchas marroquíes durante el partido debut de la Selección en París 2024, pero sorprendentemente minimizó la gravedad del episodio. Lo que sucedió este miércoles en el Estadio Geoffroy-Guichard de la ciudad de Saint-Étienne durante el comienzo de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 fue un bochorno sin precedentes. La victoria de Marruecos 2-1 sobre la Selección argentina quedó en un segundo plano por todo lo que sucedió con los incidentes provocados por los hinchas marroquíes que se metieron a la cancha tras el empate de Cristian Medina al minuto 106. Esta grave situación provocó que se suspendiera momentáneamente la finalización del partido y se prolongara por casi dos horas la anulación del empate mediante la intervención del VAR. Esto se sumó a las constantes interrupciones del juego por parte de fanáticos (en su mayoría de Marruecos) que se metieron en el campo de juego durante los 90 minutos, en una clara muestra de ineficacia de del protocolo de seguridad. Mirá el video En ese sentido, frente a las presiones de la prensa y el público general por el fracaso de la organización, este jueves salió a hablar Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, ministra de Deportes de Francia. Sin embargo, en vez de dar explicaciones sobre las fallas de la seguridad del estadio, minimizó lo sucedido y lo trató el como \"una travesura\". A pesar de que en las imágenes se ve claramente cómo desde las tribunas caían botellazos y distintos objetos contundentes dirigidos a los jugadores de Argentina, incluidos petardos, la ministra señaló con bastante soltura: \"Hubo una pequeña intrusión que no debería haber ocurrido, pero que fue bastante bondadosa por parte de los seguidores marroquíes. Luego se entrelazó con un largo tiempo de descuento en el que hubo un poco de dilación en cuanto al arbitraje\". Además, también hizo de cuenta que todo terminó ahí y se refirió a la continuidad del fútbol en los Juegos Olímpicos: \"Se llevó a cabo una reunión entre el Comité Olímpico Internacional y la FIFA, todo volverá a la normalidad. Todo será perfecto en el partido del próximo sábado entre Ucrania y Marruecos. Estoy comprometida con esto”, indicó.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Limestone County, Alabama from 1901-2000 was 41.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Limestone County, Alabama experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Limestone County, Alabama history.",

    "title": "Seguidores de Evo Morales afirman que la toma militar fue un \"autogolpe\" de Luis Arce",
    "text": "Seguidores de Evo Morales afirman que la toma militar fue un &quot;autogolpe&quot; de Luis Arce La Paz, 27 jun (EFE).- Los seguidores del expresidente de Bolivia Evo Morales (2006-2019) dijeron este jueves que la toma militar de la Plaza Murillo, en donde están las sedes del Gobierno y del Parlamento en La Paz, fue un &quot;autogolpe&quot; y apuntaron como &quot;autor intelectual&quot; al presidente Luis Arce y al vicepresidente David Choquehuanca. &quot;Se han hecho la burla del país. Este presidente ya no sabe cómo subir su imagen (...) el autor intelectual es Luis Arce y David Choquehuanca y el autor material es (Juan José) Zuñiga&quot;, señaló el vicepresidente del oficialista Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), Gerardo García. La tarde de este miércoles, Bolivia pasó por horas de zozobra cuando un grupo de militares fuertemente armados se tomó la plaza y desplegaron tanquetas, bajo las órdenes del entonces comandante del Ejército, Juan José Zuñiga. Minutos antes, Arce denunció movimientos &quot;irregulares&quot; cerca de la Casa de Gobierno y después una tanqueta derribó el portón del palacio presidencial. El mandatario salió al encuentro de Zuñiga para darle la orden de que se replegara, pero el uniformado se resistió a cumplir ese mandato. Luego, el jefe militar declaró a los medios que buscaba &quot;reconstruir la democracia&quot; y que su primera acción sería liberar a los &quot;presos políticos&quot;. Arce relevó de inmediato a todo el alto mando militar y después los uniformados abandonaron la plaza en medio de insultos, golpes y reproches de los cientos de funcionarios del Gobierno y de seguidores que celebraron que el presidente resistió a un &quot;intento de golpe de Estado&quot;. Cuestionan al Gobierno &quot;¿Cuándo se ha visto un golpe de los militares con los balines? ¿Cuándo se ha visto un golpe en el que (los militares) tengan de dialogar con el presidente?&quot;, recriminó García. Cuando habían golpes de Estado &quot;los militares entraban a matar, con balas, a reducir al presidente y a los ministros. Ellos entraban directamente a torturarlos y meterlos presos&quot;, continuo García. Por su parte, el abogado del MAS Wilfredo Chávez, quien fue ministro en el Gobierno (interior) de Morales, aseguró que los hechos del miércoles tenían la intención de &quot;levantar la imagen de Lucho (Arce) y tapar la mala gestión, tapar que no hay gasolina, que no hay dólares&quot;. Chávez cuestionó que unidades como el Batallón Colorados de Bolivia, la Casa Militar de Palacio de Gobierno y la Unidad Táctica de Operaciones Policiales (Utop), encargados de la seguridad del Gobierno, que no hayan actuado ante la toma militar. &quot;Les han entregado (a los militares), pues, la plaza Murillo ¿Cómo no va a ser un autogolpe?&quot;, agregó. El abogado del MAS señaló que la intención de Zuñiga &quot;era detener a Evo Morales&quot;, como afirmó en un programa de televisión el lunes, y que pese a todo &quot;no han podido&quot;. En la víspera, el destituido comandante Zuñiga fue detenido por la Policía y durante su arresto aseguró que el fin de semana se reunió con Arce y que el presidente le pidió hacer algo para &quot;levantar&quot; su popularidad, por lo que sacó las tanquetas blindadas. El Gobierno señaló que lo ocurrido este miércoles fue un &quot;golpe de Estado frustrado&quot; y presentó públicamente a Zúñiga como responsable de la acción militar, junto al también destituido comandante de la Armada Juan Arnez. Sobre ellos pesan acusaciones por alzamiento armado y terrorismo además de otros delitos, por lo que se espera que en esta jornada comparezcan ante un juez. (c) Agencia EFE",

    "text": "Escaping the Chaos\nIn the wake of Storm Grerit’s havoc, Euan Welsh, 21, recounts how a seemingly ordinary decision—to head for a pint at his local pub, JD Wetherspoon in Stalybridge—may have spared him from the wrath of a powerful tornado.\nThe storm, with gusts reaching up to 80mph, unleashed chaos in Greater Manchester, prompting warnings for locals to remain indoors due to the severity of the damage caused.\nAround 100 homes bore the brunt of the destruction, left with shattered roofs and battered vehicles as debris rained down.\nA Pint of Respite\nEuan, usually not one for post-work pub visits, made an impromptu choice to stop by for a San Miguel.\nLittle did he know, this decision possibly saved his life.\nReflecting on the night, he mused that had he not opted for that drink, he might have been navigating the debris-laden streets, putting himself at risk amidst the fallen trees and rubble.\nThe realization that a casual outing might have been a life-saving act left Euan stunned.\nUnforeseen Terrors Unleashed\nDiscovering shortly afterward that the calamity was, in fact, a tornado, Euan and his friends grappled with the incredulity of such an event in their region.\nThe scene outside the pub painted a surreal picture—windows blown out, shards of glass scattered everywhere, and a neighboring bistro devastated by the ferocity of the storm.\nWhile Euan’s home escaped harm, the same couldn’t be said for some of his neighbors’ residences, witnessing roofs stripped bare and fences obliterated.\nTales of Devastation\nAccounts of the tornado’s impact varied but shared a common thread of disbelief and destruction.\nKevin Welsh, Euan’s father, expressed astonishment, having never encountered such chaos in the 36 years he’d lived in their home.\nLyndsey Moody, another affected resident, recounted the terror of a chimney crashing into her son’s room, narrowly missing a tragedy.\nShe now grapples with the aftermath, lamenting the loss of cherished possessions and the sudden upheaval caused by the disaster.\nA Community Altered\nThe tornado’s swift and brutal visitation left lasting impressions on the community.\nJeffrey Sheehan, who narrowly escaped the tumultuous winds while walking his dog, recounted the surreal sight of a roof hurtling past his window.\nChief Superintendent Mark Dexter emphasized the imperative of safety, urging caution due to the debris-laden roads and advising displaced residents against returning until structural assessments were complete.\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath, efforts like the GoFundMe page aim to aid those affected by this unforeseen natural calamity.\nRead More On The Topic On TDPel Media []https://pelmedic.com\nBe Steadfast In Shielding Children From Privation And Abuse – Mrs Obiano Nigeria – Wife of Governor of Anambra State and founder of Caring Family Enhancement Initiative (CAFE), Dr. Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano (Osodieme) has called on parents...\nJoe Swash Credits “I’m A Celebrity” for Introducing Him to Wife Stacey Solomon and Giving Him a Career and Family …By Henry George for TDPel Media.
