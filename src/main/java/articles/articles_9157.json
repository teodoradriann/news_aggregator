Police later cleared the area, but patriarchal authorities say they are not punishing those responsible. Settler attacks on Palestinians have multiplied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7.\n“Bishops, priests, deacons, seminarians and indigenous Armenians are fighting for their very lives,” a statement from the Patriarchate said.\n“We call upon the Israeli government and the police to start an investigation against Danny Rothman and George Warwar for organising their criminal attacks on the Armenian Patriarchate and community.”\nThe named pair are accused of involvement in commercial deals of disputed validity which would acquire land in the Armenian Quarter, and residents blamed Mr Warwar for organising Thursday’s assault.",

    "title": "Lemon-Roasted Potatoes",
    "text": "Roasted potatoes are shown some lemon love (along with rosemary and garlic) in Lemon-Roasted Potatoes—a classy side dish that can be put together in no time.\nTable of Contents\nI always associate\nroasted potatoes with Sunday dinners. Roast beef, carrots, gravy… and roasted potatoes. The dinner wouldn’t be complete without them. Don’t tell my mom but I would rotate my plate so that the potatoes faced me and took center stage. As far as I was concerned, they were the stars of the show.\nI’m a sucker for good texture and, let me tell you, these potatoes deliver. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Even if I had a cold and couldn’t taste anything, I would eat these potatoes. You’ll be reassured to know, though, that these particular potatoes are a refreshing twist on your traditional roasties, doused as they are in lemon juice and zest. They’re similar to my\nGarlic Roasted Potatoes, which also adds flavor to the dinner staple, but this recipe provides a freshness you won’t get from garlic alone. Try it, and soon you too will be rotating that plate!\nAre Lemon-Roasted Potatoes Healthy?\nPotatoes are a good source of vitamins and minerals, as is the lemon. They’re high in carbs, which your body needs for energy. The ingredients are all-natural so you won’t be putting anything processed into your system, which is always a good thing. This recipe also works with a variety of diets, including Whole30, dairy-free, gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, soy-free, sugar-free, and vegan.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 2 pounds Potatoes, Cut into 2-inch cubes\n- 3 Tbsp Olive oil\n- 1 tsp Sea Salt\n- 1 tsp ground Black Pepper\n- 1 Tbsp Lemon Zest\n- 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n- 2 Sprigs Rosemary\n- 2 cloves Garlic\nINSTRUCTIONS\nMix\nWash the potatoes in cold water. Add the potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper to a large baking tray (9 x 16 inches). Mix well to coat.\nRoast\nRoast in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the tray and flip the potatoes. Place back in the oven and bake for another 20 minutes.\nAdd\nRemove the tray from the oven. Sprinkle on the lemon zest, lemon juice, rosemary leaves, and garlic. Toss again. Roast for an additional 10 minutes.\nDEVOUR!\nTips & Tricks to Making Perfect Lemon-Roasted Potatoes\n- Cut the potato cubes as uniformly as possible to ensure consistent cooking.\n- Don’t overcrowd the pan. You want to let the heat access all sides of the potatoes.\n- Use fresh lemon juice. Store-bought juices taste synthetic and contain more ingredients than you need.\n- For added crispness, broil your potatoes for the last few minutes of their time in the oven. Just keep an eye on them so you don’t burn them.\n- Don’t cover the potatoes if you don’t plan on eating them immediately. Trapping in the steam will remove their crispness.\nFAQs\nYou want potatoes that will keep their shape and possess a certain degree of waxiness. With that in mind, I recommend Yukon Gold or\nRusset. Red potatoes also work.\nYes, you can. In fact, I’ve developed\na recipe that goes over the steps involved.\nParboiling (or, pre-cooking) can be done but isn’t necessary. Parboiling can make your potatoes crispy and ensure a consistent, soft inside, but obviously, is an extra step. If you have the time, feel free to try it.\nWashing them removes excess starch. If you don’t perform this step, your potatoes could turn out crumbly and not crunchy. Also, wash them in cold water; hot water actually activates the starch, which is counter to what we want.\nFor seasoning, try thyme or oregano. For cheesy fun, sprinkle some grated Parmesan all over the spuds. Cayenne, paprika, and cumin will add a kick, while honey or maple syrup will transform them into a sweet treat.\nServing Suggestions\nRoasted potatoes are so versatile, they can go with any meat, be it\nGoat Cheese–Stuffed Chicken Breasts With Balsamic Blueberry Salsa, Low-Carb Keto Philly Cheesesteak Stuffed Peppers With Cauliflower, or Baked Honey Cajun Salmon. You can also pair them with other vegetables, like Parmesan Roasted Ranch Cauliflower With Avocado or Smoked Corn on the Cob.\nHow to Prep and Store Lemon-Roasted Potatoes\nLet the potatoes cool completely then store in an airtight container. Put them in the fridge where they should last for up to 5 days. To reheat, put them in a 350°F oven for 20 minutes or microwave them (though this may rob them of their crispness). Freezing isn’t recommended, as potatoes will turn grainy when thawed.\nIngredients\n- 2 lb. potatoes cut into 2-inch cubes\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tsp sea salt\n- 1 tsp ground black pepper\n- 1 tbsp lemon zest\n- 2 tbsp lemon juice\n- 2 sprigs rosemary\n- 2 cloves garlic\nInstructions\n- Wash the potatoes in cold water. Add the potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper to a large baking tray (9 x 16 inches). Mix well to coat.\n- Roast in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the tray and flip the potatoes. Place back in the oven and bake for another 20 minutes.\n- Remove the tray from the oven. Sprinkle on the lemon zest, lemon juice, rosemary leaves, and garlic. Toss again. Roast for an additional 10 minutes.\nTips & Notes:\n- Don’t overcrowd the pan. You want to let the heat access all sides of the potatoes.\n- Use fresh lemon juice. Store-bought juices taste synthetic and contain more ingredients than you need.\n- For added crispness, broil your potatoes for the last few minutes of their time in the oven.

    "text": "春意正浓，在安徽省池州市平天湖试验示范基地，正处盛花期的紫云英随风摆动，仿佛绿海掀起紫浪，浸润着即将播种的稻田。旋耕撒肥一体机轰鸣作响，铁犁翻滚之处，绛紫色的花瓣随着灰白色的“弹丸”被一同埋入泥土，留下松软的田地。\n紫云英是我国南方稻区最有代表性的绿肥植物，这些“弹丸”则混合了多种由“新型绿肥产品创制与产业化”项目研发的减排、控镉绿肥增效产品，包括最新研制并投入市场的调酸控镉缓释肥“控丐美”。它们融进田地，让氮素与有机质加速积累，让重金属污染不断减轻，而几个月后，这片稻田也将以沉甸甸的稻穗完成一场“生态轮回”。\n日前，该项目在池州市召开2025年度现场观摩暨交流会，会议由茂施农业科技有限公司与中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所联合主办，项目指导专家组成员、各课题及子任务负责人、全国农业技术推广服务中心代表等出席会议，共同探讨绿肥技术发展的现状与未来。\n为什么要发展绿肥技术？我国以全球约10%的耕地，生产了全球20%以上的粮食和近30%的蔬菜水果。然而，长期超负荷耕作让农田难以休养生息，土壤退化、肥力低下、重金属污染、农业面源污染等问题相伴而生。\n绿肥是利用季节性或空间性闲置的土地种植的固氮及养地作物，将其翻压回田或者覆盖还田，能够为农田提供养分和有机物。这种方法在我国农耕史上源远流长，《齐民要术》记载“美田之法，绿豆为上”，民间农谚流传“绿肥种三年，瘦地变肥田”。如今，立足“绿肥内源调控土壤健康”的科学理念，以“绿肥制度+新产品协同”为研发思路的技术模式，正在续写我国绿肥新的篇章。\n“解决好农田土壤内部的问题，才能真正遏制土壤退化的发生和发展。”项目负责人、中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所研究员曹卫东认为，绿肥不同于商品有机肥、畜禽粪便等外源有机（类）肥料，其利用根植于农作制度，以其自身的生命活动活化并固定环境养分，最后回归农田，输入有机物，能够深层次地调节土壤性状。\n鉴于此，国家于2021年启动“新型绿肥产品创制及产业化”项目，目的是发挥好绿肥培育健康农田土壤的基础作用，研发出适应我国农田需求，能够同步实现养地、节肥、减排、控污的绿色、高效的新型农田投入品及有关技术模式，并实施产业化应用。\n新产品为施肥带来新方式。项目依据绿肥还田后能够提供的养分、提升土壤肥力情况，针对各地不同气候、土壤、作物类型，研制出配套的绿肥制度主作物专用缓释、配方肥。在全国15个省市区开展的应用验证结果显示，采用这些配方肥，可以减施肥料30%，并且在水稻、玉米等作物上能够实现一次性简化施肥，大大降低了农田环境压力和农事操作用工。\n在减排控污方面，鉴定获得一批钝化型、吸附性控镉材料和甲烷抑制型、氧化亚氮减排新材料，并研制出一批新产品。新材料、新产品在中低镉污染土壤上可降低土壤有效镉30%～68%，实现稻米镉符合国家安全标准（0.2mg/kg）；减少稻田甲烷排放34%～80%，降低旱地氧化亚氮排放18%～40%。\n绿肥-新产品协同技术模式在全国各地成效显著。在湖南省益阳市赫山区的研发基地，紫云英与黑麦草混播的绿肥配置，配合绿肥干耕晒垡、减排产品配施、缓控释肥一次性基施、水稻季干湿交替灌溉为核心的绿肥-双季稻节肥减排与养分流失控制技术模式，让地块实现早稻减施氮肥30%～40%、晚稻减施氮肥10%～15%、甲烷减排30.2%～35.6%、氮磷总养分流失量下降31.2%～38.5%，相较对照组水稻增产7.7%。\n福建省南平市示范基地使用绿肥协同缓释肥及减排产品，与常规施肥相比，水稻节氮40%，稻谷增产17.4%，每公顷增收1680元，甲烷减排25.6%～30.2%，氮磷养分流失量下降30.8%～35.5%。\n在西北旱地，甘肃省永昌县示范区通过春麦复种箭筈豌豆与毛叶苕子，配合专用缓释肥一次性基施，绿肥麦秸联合还田、配饰玉米炭等技术，与常规麦后休闲比较，小麦增产7%，氧化亚氮排放降低32%。\n云南省曲靖市麒麟区的酸性镉污染土壤采用光叶苕子协同石灰综合治理技术，与常规种植相比，土壤pH值从5.28提高到5.51，土壤有效镉含量降低66.4%，玉米增产5.3%，籽粒镉含量降低53.3%，符合农产品质量安全标准。\n从西北旱区到沿海稻区，“绿肥制度+新产品协同”的技术模式展现了节肥增收、固碳减排、养分流失控制、调酸控镉等多重效应。据了解，截至目前，稻区节肥减排降损示范面积46.9万亩，旱地节肥减排示范11.53万亩，镉污染治理示范3.4万亩，产业化应用5.0万亩。\n绿色、高效的缓控释肥包膜与造粒技术是产品创制的基石，也是产业化的坚实后盾。项目创新植物源膜材料及包膜技术，实现膜材料20%～90%来源于植物源原料，降解后对环境无害；整合新型滚筒包膜、数字化定量喷涂、新型抛光等技术，包膜材料用量比例可降低至2%，实现高效率、低成本、无人化包膜。创新新产品自然粘结造粒工艺，造粒过程中不添加除水以外的原料，确保产品绿色、无残留；采用高速混合盘式造粒机，实现混合、造粒一体，成球率达80%，成球速度快，30～60分钟即可完成造粒，效率提高2～4倍。\n“我们对产能非常有信心。你们要多少，我们就可以生产多少。”茂施农业科技有限公司总经理钟成虎胸有成竹。据介绍，该公司已在安徽青阳拥有年产10万吨的包膜生产线，在山东巨野拥有年产40万吨的掺混生产线。2024年新建年产分别为2000吨和1万吨的湿法盘式混合造粒生产线，研发及产业化平台建设不断推进，形成了未来大规模产业化的基础条件。\n钟成虎表示，功能型缓释肥是未来市场主流，南方稻田酸化严重，部分地区缺镁，项目研发的“控丐美”应用市场广阔。据调研，青阳本地产白云石煅烧工业废渣每年有150万吨，成本在80～100元/吨，大大降低了“控丐镁”生产成本。该产品本年度预计应用12.5万亩，未来三年预计应用60万～180万亩。\n作者：农民日报·中国农网记者 黄中钜",
