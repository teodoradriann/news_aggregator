    "text": "Five days a week. That’s the new return-to-office policy at Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and at Amazon, the retail giant now run by his designated successor Andy Jassy.\nIt’s also the return-to-office recommendation Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have announced for the U.S. federal government.\nThis is a terrible way to manage talent. It seems obvious that these unpopular policies are a way to spur employees to quit, in a kind of “self-deportation” version of layoffs – but without severance payouts, health insurance continuance or WARN Act notification periods. That may sound appealing to some employers, but they should recognize which workers are most likely to leave voluntarily: those with the most sterling credentials, the most in-demand skills, and the best alternative employment options. In other words, the top-tier talent employers are usually desperate to retain.\nJassy has denied that his return-to-office policy is a backdoor layoff, but the head of Amazon Web Services told staff that if they don’t want to work full-time in the office, “That’s OK, there are other companies around.”\nA leaked Post memo takes the same tone: “If an employee decides they do not want to return to The Post on a 5-day-a-week office schedule, we understand and will accept their resignation.”\nSimilarly, Musk and Ramaswamy, whom President-elect Donald Trump has named to spearhead a new government efficiency effort, laid out their thinking in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. A five-day-a-week schedule could result in a “wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome,” they wrote. Ramaswamy told Tucker Carlson that the plan could get perhaps one in four federal workers to quit.\nAnd Musk has repeatedly slammed those who work from home, announcing the end of remote work at Twitter (now X) in his very first email to staff. Although he later backtracked and has told some staff to work remotely after closing offices – one of his first acts at the company was to stop paying rent at several locations – he’s made no secret of his view that any form of working from home is lazy and even morally suspect.\nHe’s not the only executive to assume that those who aren’t working five days in the office are less valuable or less committed. Malcontents. Slackers. Dead weight.\nBut these assumptions are dead wrong. The employees likeliest to stay after the imposition of a strict, five-day in-office mandate are not necessarily the most talented or the most committed, but those convinced they have no better employment options; those close to retirement; and those who live nearest the office. That’s not exactly strategic talent management.\nThe employees who will quit in the face of a strict return-to-office policy are the very ones who are the most employable – the mid-career stars who will find it easiest to get another job. Remote and hybrid workers tend to be more highly educated, and wealthier, and to do the kind of work that isn’t tied to a specific location; that is, the kind of work that would be easy to do for a rival company with a more appealing set of policies.\nI am no fan of mass layoffs – I believe the data suggests they are nearly always counterproductive and corrosive – but if an organization must cut staff, it would be far better to make strategic choices about which departments should go, rather than simply let the people with the most options walk out the door.\nThe idea that five days a week in the office is better rests on several false assumptions that simply are not backed up by the data. There are both upsides and challenges to fully remote work; hybrid arrangements, on the other hand, show only upsides.\nNevertheless, there are some CEOs – a minority, but a vocal one – who keep saying remote and flexible work just doesn’t work; studies keep proving those assertions wrong. Faced with facts that don’t confirm their beliefs, even executives who usually demand rigorous evidence for major decisions simply decide to throw the data out. (Bezos, in particular, made Amazon synonymous with data-driven insight, and brought the Post more attention to customer analytics.)\nHere’s just some of the information they’re choosing to ignore: A 2024 meta-analysis of over 100 research papers on remote and hybrid work found such arrangements had a positive impact on “job satisfaction, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, supervisor-rated performance, and turnover intentions.”\nSometimes such studies are criticized because of the possibility that the employees who want to work remotely may be different in some way than those who work in the office; more responsible, more self-motivating, or with more family commitments.\nTo allay those concerns, Stanford’s Nick Bloom and his colleagues conducted a randomized experiment where employees were assigned to work in the office five days a week, or told to come in three days a week, based only on their birthdays. The randomized hybrid arrangement was so successful – reducing turnover and increasing satisfaction among both employees and managers – that the skeptical company decided to expand the program to all employees.\nBy ignoring such evidence in favor of a strict in-office policy, Musk, Ramaswamy, Jassy and Bezos are essentially daring their most credentialed, in-demand workers to quit. That’s a game of chicken they’re ultimately going to lose.",

    "text": "Mi amigo, el fotógrafo Gary, llegó al restaurante por un escabeche de bonito con una porción de arroz blanco y camotito. Para tomar pidió un jarrita con agua de Jamaica al tiempo. “María, estaba conversando con una colega periodista que se va a someter a una liposucción porque ha probados miles de dietas y no logra bajar de peso.\nLe comenté que tenga cuidado y recordé el caso de la lamentable muerte de ‘Muñequita Milly’, la joven y prometedora cantante folclórica que decidió hacerse una lipoescultura con el conocido ‘doctor Fong’. Ella seguramente quería verse mejor para su público, pero todo salió mal y perdió la vida de manera absurda.\nEse caso quedó en nada. Creo que antes de someterse a una cirugía plástica hay que pensarlo bastante, pues toda operación conlleva un riesgo de muerte. Parte de la naturaleza de las personas es querer verse bien, hasta la ancianidad, y se entiende. No hay que olvidar que nuestra vida es lo más valioso y la estamos arriesgando. Entonces, hay que hacerlo siguiendo todos los protocolos de seguridad. Algunos consejos de los expertos:\n- No te dejes convencer por precios demasiado bajos. Sospecha de las ‘gangas’ en operaciones. Para ofrecerte tanta rebaja es porque seguramente están prescindiendo de equipos médicos y de buenos profesionales de la salud. Incluso, podrían emplear insumos de mala calidad.\n- No te apresures, infórmate. Busca profesionales de la salud certificados. Si te vas a hacer una operación estética, no solo debe ser un médico, sino uno con esa especialidad que esté debidamente registrado en su colegio profesional.\n- Confirma que es un profesional idóneo. Cuando creas haber encontrado un buen médico, de prestigio y serio, debes buscar personas que se hayan puesto en sus manos y que te cuenten cómo les fue. No vaya a ser que te des con una fea sorpresa.\n- La clínica debe estar bien equipada. Hay centros de salud privados, incluso grandes y conocidos, que no cuentan con equipos de reanimación. Es tu responsabilidad ver que el lugar donde te vayan a realizar la cirugía cuente con todo lo necesario para atender una emergencia si esta se presenta. Hay inescrupulosos que hasta hacen operaciones en puestos de galerías y personas que lo aceptan”.\nGary tiene razón. Toda precaución es poca cuando se trata de nuestra salud y de nuestra vida. Me voy, cuídense.",

It is likely that if England and New Zealand top their pools they will avoid each other until the final, though that is yet to be confirmed by World Rugby.\nShow Full Article\nEngland, who have won 50 of their last 51 matches, the 2021 World Cup final defeat by New Zealand being the only aberration, also have Samoa in their group, but will expect to advance comfortably.\n“It is going to be a tough pool, it’s going to pose us questions,” said veteran England forward Marlie Packer. “But I think that’s really good for us because we don’t want to get into the knockout stages not having being posed questions.\n“Australia have come on leaps and bounds and (former England scrumhalf and captain) Jo Yat obviously has a lot of English history, which kind of adds to the magic of the fixture.”\nNew Zealand will give the utmost respect to Ireland, who beat them in the WXV last month and shocked them in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup. Japan and Spain complete the pool.\nCanada, runners-up in 2014, will face Scotland, Wales and Fiji, while France, who have finished third seven times but never made a final, take on Italy, South Africa and tournament debutants Brazil.\nNew Zealand have been the dominant force since the first tournament in 1991, with England (twice) and the United States the only other nations to triumph.\nNew Zealand have won the last two finals against England, who have been runners-up six times but beat New Zealand twice recently.\nThe tournament will be held across eight venues from Aug. 22-Sept. 27 with the opening game at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light.\nSix locations will hold pool matches, including Brighton and Hove, Exeter, Salford, Northampton and York. Exeter and Bristol will stage the quarter-finals with the latter also hosting both semis.\nThe final at Twickenham, London on Sept. 27 is expected to be an 82,000 sellout, which would be the biggest crowd ever to watch a women’s international.\n(Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

Io non ho mai scritto una cosa del genere. In questo momento faccio politica, basandomi sulle sentenze dei giudici, non mi permetterei mai di scrivere una cosa del genere. L’ho scoperto perché mi hanno telefonato e l’ho subito cancellato. Ho anche modificato la privacy del profilo e penso che farò anche una denuncia alla Polizia postale”. Lo ha detto all’Adnkronos Salvo Coppolino, l’ex consigliere provinciale di Palermo di An e ora vicino a Fdi, sul cui profilo è apparso il posto contro Elly Schlein. Che ora non c’è più perché cancellato dallo stesso ex politico che oggi lavora all’Ars.\n“Leggo basito le parole pubblicate sul profilo di Salvo Coppolino, dalle quali l’interessato ha preso le distanze. A prescindere dalla loro reale paternità, sono frasi che condanno fermamente, esprimendo la mia solidarietà alla segretaria Elly Schlein. Spero proprio che uguale sensibilità possa avvertire la sinistra quando sono altri a subire analoghi sciagurati attacchi”.

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A Big Ten team stole\nOhio State’s running back coach in the middle of the spring, so Ohio State did the same to another Big Ten team.\nSherrone Moore chose to poach his rival for his first coaching staff at Michigan by brining Tony Alford — who’d been in Columbus for nine years — to Ann Arbor just a week after the Buckeyes had started spring practice. For the second time, Ryan Day was put into a position of having to call an audible nle on his 2024 coaching staff. He’d already done it with his offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach going from Bill O’Brien to longtime mentor Chip Kelly. Now he was without a running back coach.\nLatest Ohio State Buckeyes news\nDillon Gabriel could’ve been Ohio State’s 2024 starting quarterback, here’s why he’s not The 3 most interesting things we saw and heard on the last Big Ten Media Day What Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said about quarterback competitions and more at Big Ten Media Days What Michigan’s Sherrone Moore, Donovan Edwards said about former Ohio State coach Tony Alford\nThe middle of the spring isn’t an ideal time to be hiring staff members so doing so would require him to also take from someone else. That led to him hiring Carlos Locklyn to run a group feature\nTreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins as the stars at the top, while freshmen James Peoples and Sam Williams-Dixon developed behind them.\nThat left Oregon with the empty hand. But there’s no hard feelings from Lanning.\n“He did a great job for us,” Lanning said. “Worked hard and was certainly about relationships. Grateful for his time he spent with us and excited to see what he does in the future.”\nThe third-year Ducks coach pivoted to Ra’Shaad Samples whom he stole from Arizona State continuing the dominoe caused by the Wolverines of coaches stealing coaches in the middle of the spring. But at least now that dominoes is out of the Big Ten.\nNow the focus shifts towards a season where both stolen coaches will have to return to their former programs for an OSU game. Locklyn returns to Eugene, Oregon, on Oct. 12 for a highly-anticipated matchup between the top two teams in Cleveland.com’s preseason Big Ten Media Poll. Alford returns to Columbus on Nov. 30, for the 2024 version of The Game between the reigning national champion Wolverines and an Ohio State team hopign to put an end to its three-game losing streak.\nIf you or a loved one has questions and needs to talk to a professional about gambling, call the Ohio Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-589-9966 or the National Council on Program Gambling Helpline (NCPG) at 1-800-522-4700 or visit\n1800gambler.net for more information. 21+ and present in Ohio.

    "text": "Neuf départements du sud-est de la France restent placés en vigilance orange ce vendredi 2 août. La zone touchée par la vague de chaleur dans le sud-est de la France se réduit ce vendredi, même si neuf départements restent placés en vigilance orange. De forts orages sont également attendus sur le Massif central. La vague de chaleur dans le sud-est de la France devrait perdurer dans plusieurs départements jusqu’à samedi soir, notamment en Corse et dans les Bouches-du-Rhône. Dans son bulletin météo de 6 h, Météo France a mis fin à la vigilance orange canicule dans quatre départements : le Rhône, l’Isère, la Drôme et l’Ardèche. Ce seuil d’alerte ne sera levé que samedi matin dans les Alpes-Maritimes, les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et le Vaucluse, et samedi soir à 22 h pour le Var, le Gard et l’Hérault. La Corse et les Bouches-du-Rhône seront les dernières zones encore concernées par la vigilance orange à partir de samedi soir. Météo France note que l’air est « encore très chaud et parfois humide sur le sud du pays ». La barre des 40 °C a notamment été dépassée près de la Méditerranée et en Corse ce jeudi, avec un pic à 41,2 °C aux Arc dans le Var. L’institut météorologique indique également que les températures restent « très élevées » ce vendredi matin à 5 h, avec par exemple 27,1 °C à Istres ou encore 27,7 °C à Aigues-Mortes. Orages sur le Massif central La Seine-et-Marne, la Meurthe-et-Moselle et les Vosges sont par ailleurs placées en vigilance orange pour crues, après les fortes précipitations lors des dernières 24 heures. « Les 100 mm ont été dépassés » entre Épinal et Vittel (Vosges), indique notamment Météo France. «Â Des orages forts sont Ã attendre sur le Massif central qui dÃ©borderont sur la basse vallÃ©e du RhÃ´neÂ Â», associÃ©s Ã des Â«Â phÃ©nomÃ¨nes localement violentsÂ Â» comme de fortes bourrasques et de la grÃªle, ajoute lâ€™institut de prÃ©vision, sans placer ces zones en vigilance orange pour le moment.",

    "text": "El [boxeo](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/boxeo) está nuevamente en el ojo de la tormenta más allá de que la competencia terminó en los [Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/juegos-olimpicos). Esta vez, la situación no tiene nada que ver con las boxeadoras del escándalo ( [Imane Khelif](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/imane-khelif) y Lin Yu-ting), sino con dos de los jueces que participaron de la gran mayoría de los combates a lo largo de las semanas que duró el certamen. En principio, ambos recibieron una dura sanción por su desempeño durante los JJOO. Los apuntados son los kazajos Alisher Altaev y Yermek Suiyenish, quienes entraron en la polémica por presunta corrupción. Cabe destacar que no es la primera vez que esta cuestión tiene lugar en el olimpismo ya que sucedió algo similar con quienes cumplieron el mismo rol en Rio 2016. En aquella ocasión, la Asociación Internacional de Boxeo Amateur (AIBA) -hoy IBA- suspendió a 36 jueces y ahora el Comité Olímpico Internacional hizo lo propio con los dos nacidos en Kazajistán. La ausencia de ambos en las finales llamaron la atención, ya que participaron de todas las instancias previas hasta el 4 de agosto. Con el paso de los días, Altaev trabajó en 25 peleas y su compatriota en 21, por lo que es posible que en muchos duelos se hayan dado resultados injustos. De hecho fueron polémicos porque tras la noticia de la sanción aparecieron las críticas de quienes se vieron perjudicados por los fallos de los combates. En medio de esta situación también está la IBA, la cual dejó de organizar la competencia por decisión del COI debido a casos de corrupción. Dicha entidad no participó de Tokio 2020 como tampoco de Paris 2024 a raíz de esta suspensión. Ahora tampoco dirá presente en Los Ángeles 2028 donde la World Boxing se perfila a encabezar la disciplina, aunque tampoco está confirmado como ente para estar a cargo y el deporte de los puños está en duda para dicha competencia que tendrá lugar en Estados Unidos. Boxeo: el sorprendente cambio que se espera para los Juegos Olímpicos de Los Ángeles 2028 El boxeo fue una de las disciplinas que tuvo lugar en los Juegos Olímpicos 2024 y sin dudas tuvo más de una polémica con el paso de las semanas. Sin embargo, los directivos atravesaron un problema que no pasó por la competencia en cuestión, sino por lo que sucederá más adelante. Por este motivo, preparan un cambio que sin dudas generará [un impacto a nivel mundial](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/deportes/boxeo/world-boxing-buscara-reconocimiento-del-coi-para-los-juegos-de-2028-202432011163) teniendo en cuenta la trascendencia de este deporte. La World Boxing, creada en abril del 2023 y con Boris van der Vorst como presidente, será quien se haga cargo del boxeo en los Juegos Olímpicos que se desarrollarán en Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, si bien todo indica que se llevarán a cabo con normalidad, el director deportivo del COI, Kit McConnell, aseguró que esto no hay certezas con respecto a este tema. Para que esto suceda, el plan es que las federaciones de cada uno de los países se unan y apoyen a la nueva organización para que el deporte de los puños diga presente en 2028. Hasta el momento, hay 188 púgiles clasificados y las 51 plazas restantes se definirán entre el 25 de mayo y el 2 de junio en un torneo a disputarse en Bangkok, Tailandia.",
