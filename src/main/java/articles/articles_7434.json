    "title": "Waqf bill bats for deprived Muslims: Govt | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "NEW DELHI: Lashing out at the opposition for criticising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said the Waqf management was captured by some strong Muslim communities at the cost of minor groups like Bohras, Pasmandas, Ahmedias and Aghakhanis, and changes to the law would provide justice to them as well as to Muslim women and children.The bill’s introduction in Lok Sabha was met with vociferous criticism from the opposition which termed it an attempt by BJP to create a polarising issue against Muslims with an eye on the coming Maharashtra and Haryana elections.The Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, related to the Waqf bill for scrapping of the old Act, was also introduced.Rijiju said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill did not seek to interfere in the religious affairs of Muslims nor was it anti-Muslim as alleged by the opposition.He said it was futuristic in its intent to rid the law of archaic provisions and for bringing the ‘statute of limitations’ into force, which would bar any person from being able to lay ancestral claim dating back 500 years to a property and getting it declared Waqf asset.Congress’s K C Venugopal and Gaurav Gogoi, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and Mohibullah Nadwi, DMK’s Kanimozhi, RSP’s N K Premachandran, AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, NCP’s Supriya Sule, Trinamool’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Kalyan Banerjee and Mian Altaf of NC among others said the bill violated Articles 25-26 of the Constitution and was BJP’s attempt to interfere in the religious affairs of Muslims, besides being outside the legislative competence of the govt and Parliament.They also warned that it would not withstand judicial scrutiny.Rijiju gave a point-wise rebuttal to their arguments, stating that important changes suggested in the bill were as per the suggestions of Sachar Committee that was constituted and accepted by the former Congress govt.Venugopal said the bill was unconstitutional and should not be allowed.Allowing non-Muslims to be members of Waqf Boards was an attack on the Muslim religion and their faith, he said, adding that it was designed keeping in mind the forthcoming elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.“This House doesn’t have the competence to amend this Act,” Asaduddin Owaisi said, adding that Waqf properties were not public properties.Bandyopadhyay and Kanimozhi, too, called it violative of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. While Bandyopadhyay reminded the chair that land being a state subject, the bill was “unconstitutional, divisive and against federalism”, Kanimozhi said the bill was against Muslims and minorities.Premachandran said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill was intended to disempower Waqf Boards as it would be for the collector or the govt to certify whether a property was a Waqf property or not. “They are removing Section 104. Then, removing Section 40 means that there is no need for Waqf Boards. Waqf Boards become totally powerless. It means that they are dismantling the system,” the RSP functionary added.",

The suspects, including three alleged senior IS militants, were detained in raids carried out at dawn in nine provinces across Turkey, Anadolu Agency reported, citing unnamed security sources. They were detained in a joint operation by the country's intelligence agency and police, the agency said. The arrests come a week after police rounded up 304 suspected IS militants in simultaneous raids across Turkey in what appeared to be a security sweep leading up to the New Year festivities. The Islamic State group has carried out a string of deadly attacks in Turkey, including a shooting at an Istanbul night club on January 1, 2017, that killed 39 people during New Year celebrations.

    "text": "- Crypto miner Diversified Energy abandoned a Pennsylvania gas-powered mining plant, fueling environmental concerns.\n- Despite a 2021 deal to plug 14 wells, the firm failed to do that, invoking concerns regarding its history of neglecting cleanup duties for aging oil and gas plants.\n- The event falls into growing U.S. backlash against crypto mining.\nCryptocurrency mining firm Diversified Energy has abandoned a natural gas-powered mining facility in Elk County, Pennsylvania. The firm, in a report by a local outlet, left the wells open, a move that violates the law governing mining operations in that region.\nLong dormant since its near-decade-long inactivity, the Longhorn Pad A facility was restarted in 2022 by Diversified Energy. The crypto miner utilized the facility’s vast gas reserves to power generators that fed its bitcoin mining hardware.\nThe report accused the company of neglecting to obtain the air quality permit from the state department of environmental protection (DEP) before starting its operations in 2022. The company did obtain this permit in December 2023.\nMeanwhile, a two-month delay between a site visit by the DEP revealed that Diversified had moved its mining equipment elsewhere. The DEP had to serve a formal notice of violation for well abandonment when it found vacant metal sheds at the site bare of almost all of the company’s production equipment.\nDiversified Energy replied that it didn’t abandon the site, but intended to resume gas production in the near future. But the DEP and environmental experts stated that the company walked away from its responsibilities.\nAs part of a 2021 settlement, the crypto miner agreed to shut down Longhorn A and 13 other wells when it closes. But it has not lived up to that agreement.\nDiversified Energy’s Broken Promises and Mounting Hazards\nThe environmental organizations have long been troubled by the crypto miner’s business model of buying up old, inefficient wells and wringing out the last ounce of production from them, but without shutting them down properly.\nWith a price tag of over $100,000 per site to plug a well, Pennsylvania’s over 350,000 orphaned wells are a disaster waiting to happen. That only adds to the economic and environmental danger.\nIn a separate legal agreement, Diversified Energy agreed to plug 3,000 wells by 2034. But Horton County (where the Longhorn facility is situated) officials indicated the company has not given them any updates.\nU.S. States Push Back Against Crypto Mining Disruptions\nEarlier this year, Arkansas legislators passed a bill to ban the location of crypto miner facilities within 30 miles of military bases across the state. Also, last October, residents of Granbury, Texas, took legal action against Marathon Digital, claiming that its mining facility was polluting their environment with noise.\nRelated Reading | XRP Price Trends: Can the $1.85 Buy Zone Lead to a Breakout to $3.87?",
