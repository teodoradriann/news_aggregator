    "text": "Vietnam is now in its fifth year of implementing the National Digital Transformation Program. Over the past four years, the first year marked the initiation of digital transformation, the second year served as a comprehensive rehearsal during the Covid-19 pandemic, the third year focused on building national digital platforms, and the fourth year centered on the development of digital data.\nTo provide readers with insights into Vietnam's digital transformation journey, VietNamNet conducted an interview with Dr. Guy Diedrich, Senior Vice President and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco, and Mr. Jason Kalai, Acting General Manager of Cisco Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.\nDr. Guy Diedrich, Senior Vice President and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco (left), and Mr. Jason Kalai, Acting General Director of Cisco Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Photo: The Vinh. What has Vietnam achieved after more than four years of implementing the national digital transformation program?\nMr. Jason Kalai: Vietnam has made remarkable strides in all three pillars of digital transformation - digital government, digital economy, and digital society. This progress is a clear testament to the success of the country's digital transformation plans.\nThere has been significant change in adopting digital technology to drive economic growth, leverage digital data, and enhance smart connectivity. In recent years, we have also witnessed the increasing role of technology in the daily lives of Vietnamese people.\nSome opinions suggest that raising awareness about digital transformation is one of the things that Vietnam has done well. Could you please share your views on this?\nDr. Guy Diedrich: Vietnam stands out as one of the countries with a strong awareness of digital transformation in everyday life, from government officials to the general public. This is a significant advantage on the journey toward national digital transformation.\nThe government has prioritized digital transformation with various decisions and policies, such as the \"National Digital Transformation Program to 2025, with a vision to 2030,\" issued in 2020, and the \"ICT infrastructure planning for 2021-2030, with a vision to 2050,\" signed in early 2024.\nVietnamese businesses also have forward-thinking leaders ready to act on digital transformation, supported by a young workforce that quickly adapts to technology and innovation.\nBesides the initial results, what challenges does Vietnam face in realizing its vision to become a digital nation?\nCisco experts recommend that Vietnam needs individuals who clearly understand how to use technology, maintain it, manage it, and benefit from it. Illustration by Q.Bao Dr. Guy Diedrich: Vietnam faces challenges similar to those of other countries globally, primarily the skills gap. There are many jobs requiring advanced skills, and Vietnam needs to rapidly upskill its workforce to meet these demands.\nMy advice to world leaders we work with in 50 countries is not to invest solely in technology. If Vietnam invests only in technology without concurrently investing in workforce skill development, many opportunities will be missed.\nVietnam needs individuals who understand how to use, maintain, manage, and benefit from technology. Without the necessary skills, this cannot be achieved. Enhancing skills will also create numerous job opportunities for future generations, contributing significantly to GDP growth.\nI emphasize that bridging the skills gap is a fundamental task for any country aiming to achieve digital transformation.\nCisco recently announced the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program in Vietnam. What specific initiatives will be focused on in the near future?\nDr. Guy Diedrich: Implementing the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program in Vietnam demonstrates our vision and commitment to supporting Vietnamese agencies, organizations, and businesses in their digital transformation journey. Aligned with the \"National Digital Transformation Program to 2025 and Vision to 2030,\" CDA in Vietnam focuses on enhancing the country's technological capabilities through key initiatives centered on three main pillars: national infrastructure transformation, enterprise transformation, and public sector transformation.\nFor national infrastructure transformation, we will collaborate with local service providers to develop 5G, equipping these companies with necessary skills and best practices for network innovation. 5G infrastructure is crucial for Vietnam's digital transformation, enhancing data transmission, boosting business productivity, and improving community connectivity.\nIn enterprise transformation, we will provide cutting-edge technology to the financial services and manufacturing sectors, investing in the co-development of advanced digital solutions to drive industry-wide digital transformation. This will increase the competitiveness of Vietnam's financial services and manufacturing sectors, promoting economic growth.\nFor public sector transformation, we will work with public entities to enhance Vietnam's national digital infrastructure. Initiatives in this pillar will support the establishment of a digital government, improve urban management, and promote comprehensive community development.\nMr. Jason Kalai: Vietnam's digital economy has developed positively in recent years, with digital interactions and cloud-first models quickly becoming the norm for businesses nationwide. Coupled with the government's national digital transformation plan, now is the ideal time for public-private partnerships to vigorously promote the country's digital transformation agenda.\nIn the coming period, we will work with stakeholders such as the government, industry leaders, and academic institutions to co-develop and co-innovate advanced solutions and beneficial services across the three mentioned pillars.\nVan Anh",

    "title": "The Pros and Cons of Using Cardarine for Fitness Enhancement",
    "text": "Cardarine, also known as GW501516, is a popular compound in the fitness community due to its potential to enhance physical performance. This chemical substance, initially developed for its potential benefits in treating metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, has gained traction among athletes and bodybuilders seeking an extra edge in their training routines. However, as with any performance-enhancing substance, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to incorporate Cardarine into your fitness regimen.\nCardarine Performance Enhancement\nOne of the primary reasons why individuals turn to Cardarine is its reputed ability to enhance physical performance. The compound works by activating the protein PPAR-delta in the body, which influences the body's metabolism and energy expenditure. By targeting specific genes involved in fat burning and glucose regulation, Cardarine is believed to improve endurance and stamina. As a result, athletes and fitness enthusiasts may experience increased aerobic capacity, allowing them to push through longer, more intense workouts.\nFurthermore, Cardarine is reported to enhance muscle recovery. By stimulating glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue and diminishing inflammation, this compound may aid in repairing damaged muscle fibers more rapidly. This accelerated recovery time can be especially advantageous for individuals undergoing intense training sessions or participating in endurance activities.\nIt is important to highlight that Cardarine is not a steroid and does not exhibit the same performance-enhancing effects of anabolic substances. The compound's mechanism of action is entirely different, making it an appealing option for those seeking alternatives to traditional steroid use. Additionally, Cardarine does not cause hormonal imbalances or interfere with the body's natural testosterone production.\nCardarine Pros and Cons\nPros of Using Cardarine\n1. Enhanced Endurance: Cardarine's potential ability to boost aerobic capacity can enable athletes to perform at higher intensities for longer periods, resulting in improved endurance levels.\n2. Accelerated Fat Burning: By activating genes involved in fat metabolism, Cardarine may promote fat burning, assisting individuals in achieving their desired body composition goals.\n3. Improved Cardiovascular Health: Cardarine's development initially focused on its potential cardiovascular benefits, with research suggesting it may assist in improving heart health and reducing the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases.\n4. Increased Muscle Recovery: The compound's anti-inflammatory properties may aid in reducing exercise-induced muscle damage and improving recovery time between workouts.\n5. Non-Hormonal: Unlike anabolic steroids, Cardarine does not disrupt the body's hormonal balance or interfere with natural testosterone production.\nCons of Using Cardarine\n1. Lack of Long-Term Studies: While initial findings on Cardarine's efficacy and safety are promising, there is a relative lack of long-term research regarding its effects on humans. As such, the potential risks and benefits of prolonged use remain uncertain.\n2. Regulatory Concerns: Cardarine is not approved for human consumption or use in supplements by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Consequently, individuals who opt to use this compound do so at their own risk.\n3. Potential Liver Toxicity: Some studies conducted on animals suggest that Cardarine may have hepatotoxic effects. However, more research is necessary to determine if these findings translate to humans and under what specific conditions.\n4. Unregulated Market: Due to the compound's legal and regulatory status, the market for Cardarine is largely unregulated. This lack of oversight poses the risk of purchasing counterfeit or impure substances, potentially leading to adverse health effects.\nCardarine Side Effects\nWhile Cardarine is generally well-tolerated in most individuals, it is essential to be aware of potential side effects. Some commonly reported side effects associated with Cardarine usage include:\n1. Headaches and Dizziness: Some users have reported experiencing headaches and dizziness while taking Cardarine. These side effects are typically transient and subside as the body adjusts to the compound.\n2. Nausea: Cardarine may cause mild gastrointestinal upset, leading to feelings of nausea or stomach discomfort. This symptom usually resolves on its own and is not a cause for concern.\n3. Temporary Suppression of HDL Cholesterol: Cardarine has been shown to lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in some individuals. However, this effect appears to be reversible and returns to baseline upon discontinuation of the compound.\n4. Potential Hormonal Imbalance: While Cardarine does not directly affect testosterone levels, some users have reported fluctuations in their hormonal balance. However, the extent and long-term consequences of these imbalances require further investigation.\nAs with any supplement, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before initiating Cardarine usage. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific health conditions and goals, ensuring the most informed decision.\nIn conclusion, Cardarine offers potential performance-enhancing benefits for individuals seeking to improve their fitness levels. Its ability to enhance endurance, stimulate fat burning, and promote muscle recovery make it an enticing option. However, the relative lack of long-term studies, potential side effects, and regulatory concerns merit careful consideration when deciding whether or not to incorporate Cardarine into your fitness routine. Ultimately, it is essential to prioritize your health and well-being by making informed decisions based on credible information and professional guidance.",

    "text": "在国内医疗器械行业中，迈瑞医疗是绝对的“一哥”。\n长期稳步增长的业绩，是迈瑞医疗最宽的护城河。财报显示，2016年至2023年，迈瑞医疗的营收和净利润都保持着“双位数”增长，表现最好的2020年，营收和净利润增速分别达27%和42.24%。\n然而，随着周期的调整加上行业的不景气，近两年，迈瑞医疗业绩增速肉眼可见的放缓。\n财报显示，2024年，迈瑞医疗实现营收和净利润367.3亿元和116.7亿元，营收和净利润增速分别为5.14%和0.74%，这是上市以来业绩增速最低的一年。今年一季度，迈瑞医疗的营收和净利润增速分别为-12.12%和-16.81%，这是其上市七年首次一季度负增长。\n受业绩拖累，迈瑞医疗的股价也是萎靡不振。从年线来看，迈瑞医疗的股价已经“五连阴”，截至最新收盘，迈瑞医疗总市值为2728亿元。虽然近期股价有所回升，但和最高点480.52元/股相比，迈瑞医疗股价已经腰斩，市值则缩水超过2900亿元。\n“周期”之困\n实际上，迈瑞医疗如今的困境，早在2021年时就已经注定。\n过去，迈瑞医疗的业绩之所以能稳步增长，除了自身持续高研发投入筑起了较深的护城河之外，时代红利也是重要原因。\n在2020年之前，医疗器械行业一直是政策支持的重点行业。\n据媒体统计，自2009年以来针对医疗器械行业出台过不少的支持政策。然而，2021年针对医疗器械行业推行的带量式采购，让迈瑞医疗所处的行业发生了翻天覆地的变化。\n带量采购推行之初，迈瑞医疗的态度还比较乐观，在2022年8月29日发布的调研中，面对核心产品化学发光检测项目被“砍半价”的情况，迈瑞医疗却仍乐观表示：“自去年11月份安徽省执行部分化学发光试剂集采至二季度末，公司的化学发光业务无论是仪器装机还是试剂上量均已在安徽省实现了突飞猛进的成绩。其中仪器新增装机近120台，据公司统计，占全省新增装机的比重约为三分之一，并且成功进入了近30家三甲医院，大幅缩短了仪器入院的时间”。\n不过，虽然带量采购在短期内确实能够带来“量”的增长，但对于“价”的影响其实更大。\n从最近的数据来看。在2024年11月，厦门卫健委针对全市12家医院的24台超声采购进行了招投标，首轮只有4台超声中标，皆为迈瑞医疗的产品，总中标金额79.2万元，相比于预算金额393万元，降幅达79.8%；而在今年1月，江西省医保局正式公布糖代谢等生化类检测试剂省际联盟集中带量采购中选结果，共有154家企业的2314个规格中选，产品价格平均降幅70%。多家外企报价均低于1毛钱，罗氏、迈瑞等产品以0.07元/人份的价格中选。\n另外，今年年初山东省立医院进行的一次大规模监护仪集采中，迈瑞ePM 12C系列中标价仅为每台1万元左右，较2024年平均中标价格下跌超七成。\n总结来说，带量采购对于产品价格的影响相当巨大。目前，“新周期”下的迈瑞医疗盈利能力也明显下降。从具体产品来看，迈瑞医疗的核心产品（营收占比20%以上）为体外诊断类产品、生命信息与支持类产品和医学影像类产品，2024年的毛利率分别为62.01%、62.55%和66.85%，而在2023年体外诊断类产品、生命信息与支持类产品和医学影像类产品的毛利率分别为64.3%、66.78%和69.1%。\n外延式并购“失灵”\n在产品不断被“砍价”的情况下，迈瑞医疗想要通过现有业务驱动业绩增长变得十分困难。\n还好，迈瑞医疗一直是“双腿走路”。\n除了自身固有业务之外，迈瑞医疗还会进行外延式并购。据媒体统计，2008年迈瑞收购了全球最老牌的监护品牌Datascope，一跃成为全球监护领域第三大制造商；此后公司又陆续并购了深科医疗、苏州惠生、Zonare、Ulco等多家海内外一流企业。\n而在最近两年，由于现有业务受阻，迈瑞医疗也再度开始外延并购。例如在2023年时，迈瑞医疗以1.15亿欧元收购德国IVD公司DiaSys的75%股权，DiaSys深耕行业超过30余年，在全球建立了完整的供应链体系，在欧洲、亚太、拉美地区均有生产基地；还有去年四月份，迈瑞医疗用66.5亿元自有资金，完成对科创板上市公司惠泰医疗的控制权收购，此次收购是科创板首例“A收A”，惠泰医疗主要从事心脏电生理和介入医疗器械的研发、生产与销售。\n不过，虽然也有进行外延式并购，但从业绩来看，这几次的外延式并购对于业绩的驱动并不明显。\n至于为什么会出现这种情况，很重要的原因在于随着迈瑞医疗体量的不断膨胀，其想要找到可以驱动业绩增长的并购对象不多了。例如，迈瑞医疗在早期曾以2.09亿美元的价格收购美国老牌医械公司Datascope的监护仪业务，这一次并购让迈瑞医疗一举跃升为全球监护仪第三大品牌。而后来的多次并购，则让迈瑞医疗丰富生命信息与支持、体外诊断、医学影像三大领域产品与布局，并切入骨科植入物、内窥镜等领域，令其成长为医疗器械“一哥”。\n但是，由于自身体量已经非常庞大，现在并购带来的效果自然十分有限，而且迈瑞医疗对于热门赛道的布局已经十分完善，现在进入的都是“硬骨头”，例如收购德惠泰医疗进军心血管行业，虽然这是一个规模十分庞大的市场，但该市场中国外厂商占据了85%以上的市场份额，竞争压力巨大。\n另外，现在外延式并购不但不能推动迈瑞医疗的业绩继续增长，并购带来的商誉还让其风险越来越大。财报显示，一季度迈瑞医疗的商誉值高达112.2亿元，而在2023年一季度时，迈瑞医疗的商誉值为44.17亿元，不过两年时间，迈瑞医疗的商誉值就翻了2倍多，一旦收购标的经营不及预期，很容易出现商誉减值。\n综合而言，迈瑞医疗目前面临外延式并购已经开始逐渐“失效”，面对越来越大的商誉问题，迈瑞医疗需要加速走出谷底。当然从远期来看，医疗器械赛道仍然是一个朝阳赛道，只要迈瑞医疗能够在底部夯实基础，那么未来就一定能重拾往日的荣光。\n本文作者可以追加内容哦 !",

    "title": "'Bail Out,' Says Investor About Intel Stock",
    "text": "Intel ([NASDAQ:INTC](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/intc)) had a downer of a year in 2024. While much of the tech industry reaped the rewards of the [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) revolution, Intel lagged significantly behind its data center competitors, particularly the market-dominating Nvidia. As a result, Intel shares lost more than half of their value during the year.\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n- Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\n[Top Smart Score Stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks) - Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\n[Tipranks' Stock Screener](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/stocks)\nIntel’s Board of Directors was clearly unhappy with the company’s trajectory, expressing their displeasure by removing long-time Intel veteran Pat Gelsinger from his CEO position in December. Gelsinger, who was brought back to lead Intel in February 2021, had evidently failed to win over the board with his ‘5 Nodes in 4 Years’ strategy.\nWhile company ‘shake-ups’ can cause instability, they may also help struggling firms begin to turn things around. Not so in this case, asserts one investor known by the pseudonym Value Edge, who argues that Intel’s board has failed to learn from previous mistakes.\n“The Board’s co-CEO decision mirrors past mistakes, focusing on product groups while neglecting the critical foundry segment, risking Intel’s future competitiveness,” the investor opined.\nValue Edge explains that Gelsinger was in the midst of guiding crucial significant technological developments that could have helped Intel regain its competitive advantage. The investor adds that the company veteran of nearly three decades was exceptionally familiar with Intel, its technology, and the opportunities (and challenges) within the industry.\nThe newly appointed co-CEOs, however, come from finance and marketing backgrounds – lacking the technical expertise Gelsinger brought to the role. As Value Edge points out, this gap in technical knowledge could further hinder Intel’s efforts to reclaim its standing in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n“The board wants to focus on the products group, which lost its moat in the first place due to the lagging foundry segment that Gelsinger was trying to fix,” Value Edge argued. The investor contends that an enhanced emphasis on the products group demonstrates a lack of interest in pursuing the investments needed to turn Intel’s Foundry competitive once more.\n“The current Board is made up of many of the same folks that have overseen the entire awful past decade for Intel,” concludes Value Edge, who, unsurprisingly, professes scant faith in the current leadership. The investor is therefore downgrading INTC to a Strong Sell. (To watch The Value Edge’s track record, [click here](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/the-value-edge))\nOver on Wall Street, however, the jury is still out. With 1 Buy, 21 Hold, and 5 Sell recommendations, INTC holds a consensus Hold (i.e., Neutral) rating. Nevertheless, its 12-month average price target of $24.53 suggests an upside of 23%.

    "text": "The Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) has raised the alarm that Nigeria tops the infant and maternal mortality table in the world, decrying lack of viable data on the health menace.\nFaced by the national and global challenges, World Health Organisation (WHO), in a 2022 report in new guidelines, recommended that countries with high infant mortality rates exceeding 60 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rates above 80 per 1,000 live births should adopt periodic mass administration of Azithromycin (AZM) to children aged one to 11 months, as an additional child survival strategy to reduce infant mortality rate in those highly vulnerable countries.\nPainting a report of high infant and maternal mortalities in Nigeria, the World Bank in the 2022 report stated that “Nigeria’s levels of maternal and child mortality are among the highest in the world, with maternal mortality representing 20 per cent of the global burden.”\nIn a similar report, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) study also indicated that though Nigeria represents 2.4 per cent of the world’s population, the country currently contributes 10 per cent of global deaths for pregnant mothers.\n“Latest figures show a maternal mortality rate of 576 per 100,000 live births, the fourth highest on Earth. Each year approximately 262,000 babies die at birth, the world’s second highest national total, while infant mortality rate currently stands at 69 per 1,000 live births while for under-fives it rises to 128 per 1,000 live births,” WHO report stated.\nTherefore, with the WHO’s recommendation and in the face of the staggering report, the Federal Ministry of Health & Social Welfare (FMOH&SW(, in its swift response, directed the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) to lead the task for evaluation of this strategy.\nAgainst this backdrop, the NIMR, Centre for Reproduction and Population Health Studies (CRePHS) at the Department of Clinical Sciences, swung into action with a project, tagged: “Mass Administration of Azithromycin in Children (SARMAAN Projects).”\nAccording to the Director of Research, NIMR Centre for Reproduction and Population Health Studies (CRePHS) at the NIMR Department of Clinical Sciences, Prof Oliver Ezechi, the Mass Administration of Azithromycin in Children (SARMAAN Projects), as undertaken, was a response to the 2022 new guidelines of World Health Organisation (WHO).\nInfant mortality\nEzechi, a Consultant ObstetricianGynaecologist and a Professor of Maternal, Reproductive, and Child Health at the Department of Public Health, Lead City University, Ibadan, said the SARMAAN Project was undertaken as one of NIMR Centre’s numerous research projects to generate outputs that inform evidence-based decision-making and policy to reduce infant mortality.\nThe ongoing SARMAAN Projects in two phases is undertaken by Ezechi, and two Research Fellows of the institute; Dr Abideen Salako, a Consultant Paediatrician and Dr Folahanmi Akinsolu, a Specialist in Public Health. The first phase, SARMAAN I, a pilot tested phase spanned over two years in four Northern states of the country – Kano, Kebbi, Jigawa, and Sokoto states, and two Southern states of Abia and Akwa Ibom states, respectively.\nBut, following the completion of the first phase and the success recorded in SARMAAN I, and based on the emerging findings from similar studies, there was a consensus to expand the project to 10 high burdens under five mortalities in the North – Kano, Kebbi, Kaduna, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Sokoto, Jigawa, and Zamfara states.\nThey are now calling for the vaccines against infant mortality\nUnder the SARMAAN projects, the Centre said that given credence to nations such as Nigeria to adopt periodic mass administration of Azithromycin (AZM) to children aged one to 11 months.\nProviding more insight into the projects, Ezechi told journalists during the May media chat edition of the institute, stating that however concerns of the SARMAAN Projects remained regarding the safety of such interventions, particularly related to antimicrobial resistance and cost-effectiveness.\nHe explained that the study, which is in operation with several government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and international development partners, derives its funding from the Global Fund.\nSurvival strategy\n“We not only assessed the safety and antimicrobial resistance profiles, but also examined the cost-effectiveness and the most appropriate child survival strategy platforms to integrate the MDA during implementation,” he said.\nBut, while administering the (AZM) to children, the age band was expanded from one-11 to one-59 months. Accordingly, Ezechi revealed that the study was powered to detect a change in under-five mortality rates, and that SARMAAN II Project is ongoing and would last for four years.\nBased on the study, the baseline data collection and antimicrobial sample collections had been concluded in states such as Kano, Kaduna, Sokoto and Bauchi, under the phase one.\nOn the key achievements of the SARMAAN I, the study established in SARMAAN I that mass AZM administration is safe, does not worsen antimicrobial resistance profiles, and is most cost-effective when integrated into existing child health programmes.\nUnder SARMAAN I, a total of 1.8 million doses of AZT were administered to children across six states and 52 local government areas, while a total of 2,467,196 doses of AZM were administered to 5,767,083 children in two states of Kebbi and Kaduna states, and 44 local government areas in SARMAAN II phase.\nThe Centre, however, expressed satisfaction that there was demonstration of both rich and community acceptance of AZM mass administration in those states under the study, saying as part of its achievements, the study provided direct and indirect employment opportunities for several Nigerians.\nBesides, the project, Ezechi added, attracted effective collaboration with the state ministry of health and local communities in the respective states, as those states and local communities took ownership of the project.\nBased on the study, Ezechi said it is noteworthy that parents and communities under the purview of the project are not only cooperating, they are now calling for the vaccines against infant mortality.\n“Parents in those states and local government areas are cooperating and ready to contribute to the sustenance of the project,” he stated, saying “we need to ensure that our children stop dying.”\nThe Director of Research hailed the acceptance of the mass AZM administration by parents and caregivers as an additional child survival strategy, lauding the successful integration of SARMAAN projects into existing child survival platforms. Despite the success of the SARMAAN Project 1, he highlighted some challenges that were encountered in the course of the study.\nChallenges\nEzechi, in his presentation, identified among others, poor recognition of the critical role research plays in national development; weak health system as impacting optimal project delivery; lack of and suboptimal laboratory infrastructure that hampered the efficient conduct of large-scale studies and implementation efforts of the vaccines as they have to carry out samples analysis at NIMR laboratory due to lack of laboratories in those states; as well as the challenge of insecurity which is making access to some of the areas more challenging.\nOther challenges include poor road network and hard-to-reach areas that make effective monitoring of activities difficult; limited awareness and the need to integrate research findings into policy, as well as reducing the potential impact of research outputs on health outcomes.\nListed among the challenges encountered include the shortage of skilled personnel trained in research methodologies, implementation science, and advocacy, logistical hurdles in reaching remote populations, cultural barriers that influence community acceptance, and sustainability issues stemming from dependence on external funding sources as major handicap research its efforts.\nThe Director of Research, however, spotlighted the contributions of the CRePHS to research, innovation, and policy, particularly based on key findings from the SARMAAN project, and how the Centre has shaped national health policies, especially in the area of infant and maternal mortality.\nAccording to him, the NIMR Centre for Reproduction and Population Health Studies (CRePHS) domiciles at the Department of Clinical Sciences is a multidisciplinary research centre dedicated to advancing maternal, reproductive, child, and population health.\nThe Centre’s activities and research work typically address a broad spectrum of health issues, spanning communicable and noncommunicable diseases, with a focus on improving health outcomes across the country.",

    "text": "Papa Francisco vai deixar o cargo em 2025, diz vidente\nPor Luigi Civalli - 19/02/25 às 11:35\nO sensitivo Robério de Ogum afirmou que o Papa Francisco pode deixar o cargo em 2025. Durante uma visão espiritual, ele comparou a situação à renúncia do Papa Bento XVI.\nPapa Francisco: Estado de saúde continua preocupante\nPrevisão sobre o futuro do Papa\nRobério revelou sua visão e expressou preocupação com o futuro do pontífice. “Eu quero errar essa previsão, mas vejo que este ano será repleto de dificuldades e obstáculos para o Papa Francisco. Ele não deve terminar o Papado, infelizmente”, afirmou.\nOs melhores momentos do BBB 25 você encontra no Kwai\nO vidente acredita que a possível saída de Francisco representaria um ciclo espiritual que se repete dentro da Igreja Católica. “O Papa vai enfrentar inúmeras dificuldades este ano e nós temos que rezar por ele. Esse cenário se repete mais uma vez. Vejo acontecer com o Papa Francisco, o mesmo que aconteceu com o Papa Bento: dificilmente ele terminará o Papado dele, ou se afastando ou deixando o Papado”, explicou.\nHistóricos de previsões acertadas\nRobério de Ogum já acertou previsões sobre eventos no Vaticano anteriormente. Em 2005, ele antecipou a morte de João Paulo II durante uma entrevista à revista Isto É. “Eduardo, estou muito triste porque o Senhor Ogum me mostra que o nosso Papa, João Paulo II vai falecer. Ele é muito iluminado e deixará esse plano rezando uma missa ou discursando”, declarou na época. O pontífice morreu em 2 de abril daquele ano, véspera do Domingo da Divina Misericórdia.\nReceba as Notícias de OFuxico em seu celular\nJá em 2013, o vidente previu que o Papa Bento XVI não viria ao Brasil para a Jornada Mundial da Juventude, pois renunciaria antes do evento. “Hoje, a mesma força espiritual me mostra que a história pode se repetir. O Papa Francisco pode seguir o mesmo caminho de Bento, renunciando e permanecendo recluso no Vaticano, enquanto um novo Papa assume”, declarou.\nEstado de saúde do Papa Francisco\nAtualmente, Papa Francisco enfrenta problemas de saúde e está internado no Hospital Gemelli, em Roma, para tratar uma pneumonia bilateral. O Vaticano informou que a condição do líder religioso, de 88 anos, é estável, mas o quadro segue sendo monitorado.\nLuigi Civalli\nFormado desde 2010, já passou pelas editorias de esporte e entretenimento em outros veículos do país e atualmente está no OFuxico.
