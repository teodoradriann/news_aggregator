    "text": "In my father’s living room over fifty years ago, as a young man, I first encountered these words of divine wisdom that have since been my guiding light. They remind us that we are creations of God and belong to Him, not to ourselves.\nAs you reflect on this week’s discussion, you may have encountered individuals in your life’s journey who, through their actions and treatment of others, behave as if they are the almighty creators of humanity. Powerful and influential figures often exhibit a sense of omnipotence, believing they are self-made and unaccountable. This mindset leads to the rampant embezzlement of national resources without remorse. When entrusted with power, these individuals become reckless and arrogant in their conduct, perpetrating evil deeds with impunity. Despite their misdeeds, they perceive God’s silence as a form of endorsement. However, God may remain silent, but He does not overlook the wrongdoing of men.\nThe practice of sowing seeds and reaping a harvest is not exclusive to any specific faith; it is a universal law. Every action has its consequences, and every individual will eventually face the repercussions of their behavior. Whether one remembers this fundamental truth or not, justice spares no one. Time is the ultimate revealer of our deeds.\nA Nigerian politician once attempted to enter the United States with a substantial sum of undeclared US dollars, claiming only a fraction of the actual amount in his possession. This deceptive act resulted in the confiscation of the money by US authorities, depriving Nigeria of vital resources that could have been used for societal development.\nThe narrative of corruption and theft in Nigeria remains prevalent, with perpetrators often evading punishment for their crimes. The ingrained culture of impunity around political power facilitates the perpetuation of these heinous acts, denying the country of much-needed progress and prosperity.\nWhile justice may elude the corrupt in human courts, the passage of time holds a different form of accountability that transcends mortal limitations. The day of reckoning will eventually arrive for those who exploit their positions for personal gain. Time will expose the truth of their actions.\nIn contrast to the leniency shown towards corrupt officials in Nigeria, countries like China and Vietnam have stringent laws that mandate severe consequences for embezzlement and corruption. While man may falter in delivering justice, the cosmic balance of time and destiny guarantees that wrongdoers will face the consequences of their actions.\nRegardless of how well they conceal themselves or their ill-gotten gains, evildoers cannot evade the reckoning that awaits them. The wheels of justice turn inexorably, and even the most powerful and affluent cannot escape the repercussions of their misdeeds. Time will uncover the seeds they have sown.",

    "title": "Stena Presents Futuro Concept RoRo that Would Reduce Energy Usage 20%",
    "text": "Stena Line, one of Europe's leading ferry companies and a pioneer with advanced designs, presented its latest thinking for Stena Futuro, a RoRo that would reduce energy usage by 20 percent or more. The company’s goal is an overall 30 percent reduction in its CO2 emissions by 2030.\n“The mission is to develop the most efficient and competitive vessel possible for a specific cargo capacity, using today’s available technology. The goal is for the vessel to have the lowest fuel consumption on the market,” says Nicolas Bathfield, Project Manager at Stena Teknik, who has been involved in developing the concept.\nStena Futuro would be a 240-meter (787-foot) long RoRo vessel intended for transporting semi-trailers and cars. Stena Teknik, a resource within the group for all its business units, is exploring the full range of technologies to advance the efficiency of this next-generation vessel. The group is focused on newbuilds as well as the energy and digital transformation mostly in the maritime sectors.\nStena Line's latest concept for the new generation of vessels uses a low and streamlined design to reach its ambitions. The hull and superstructure have been optimized to achieve the most efficient use of cargo space possible. At the same time, low weight and optimized hydro- and aerodynamics are central to achieving low fuel consumption. The hull of Stena Futuro would also be equipped with an air lubrication system.\nThe concept for Stena Futuro also includes four 40-meter (131-foot) tall wing sails, which can be retracted when needed — for example, when passing under a bridge. Recently, Stena’s developers, together with the Swedish research institute RISE, have conducted tests and simulations of the sails’ usage to document both energy savings and how the sails affect the ship’s maneuverability and safety.\n“The tests showed that Stena Futuro’s sails could potentially result in as much as 15 percent fuel savings. We also confirmed that the vessel meets all requirements for stability and maneuverability in scenarios such as sudden wind shifts or quick course changes,” says Bathfield.\nThe vessel would also have hybrid propulsion, batteries, and engines with low fuel consumption that can run on several different fuels. The battery system makes it ready to partly operate the vessel on electricity alone, for example, when entering and leaving ports. Solar panels will also contribute to the ship’s electricity needs. A waste heat recovery system will make it possible to reuse the hot exhaust gases from the ship’s engines to meet other onboard heating needs as well as supporting electric power generation.\nStena says the ship design will play a vital part in its future tonnage planning in the coming years. Currently, however, there is no finalized plan for the production of Stena Futuro.",

    "text": "Matthew West’s Hope Amid Post-Christmas Blues: ‘God is Still With Us’ By Movieguide® Contributor Christian artist Matthew West shared his remedy for post-Christmas “blues” during a recent podcast episode. To help people remember the eternal hope the holiday brings, he wrote a song that focuses on how Christ’s birth changed the world. “Even on the day after Christmas, the Light of the world has not left us,” West [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWhwYxjIMk). “This Christmas on our tour, we sang, ‘Away in a Manger, Love Came Near.’ At Christmastime we celebrate that our God loved us enough to come near in the form of sending his only son. And then we would sing a song called, ‘The God Who Stays.’ That is the hope that we have as followers of Christ. That we worship a God that not only came near, but who stays near. Who is with us. Even as Christmas ends. Emmanuel, God is still with us.” West spent his Christmas with his family. “Merry Christmas from the West Family! ‘For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given’ (Isaiah 9:6),'” he posted on Instagram. The singer is also preparing for his latest song, “Don’t Stop Praying,” to drop in January. “DON’T STOP PRAYING 🙏🏻 Available to stream 01.05. Pre-save now at the link in my bio!” West [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0xIe3apiMg/). “I hope when you hear this song you are reminded that God is listening when you call on His name. The Bible says in James 5:16, ‘The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.’ Your Father is with you. He sees you and He hears you. What are you praying for?” West will be [heading](https://www.matthewwest.com/tour) on tour with Cochren & Co. starting in February. “Join them for a fun night of faith, hope and encouragement on the ‘Don’t Stop Praying Tour,'” K-LOVE posted. Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/matthew-west-on-how-he-got-started-in-music-a-late-bloomer.html) on West: Christian musician Matthew West recently opened up about how he got started in music during his annual Come Home for Christmas weekend… “My process of learning the guitar—I was actually a bit of a late bloomer musically because I was more focused on sports in school,” West [admitted]. “And when I realized I wasn’t going to be a professional baseball player, I decided to shift my focus and I really just took to music.” “But I never really played an instrument until I was 17, my senior year of high school,” he [said]. “My dad bought me a guitar, and I still have that first guitar. I taught myself how to play basically. I got a poster from Walmart, and it was called ‘The Chord Finder,’ it was basically all of these little numbers, and it showed you where to put your fingers to play different chords.” West added that because he was a freshman in college and didn’t know many people, he stayed in his room and learned to play guitar.",

    "text": "via Brandon Wenerd\n“What are those?”!\nA Mammoth Mountain liftie hopped on the chair with me during his break, heading up Chair 21 on a bluebird Saturday in December as I worked my way toward Gold Rush, eager to finally hit High-Five Express and get to the top of the mountain to rip a long run with some serious vertical drop. If you ski or ride Mammoth, you know what I’m talking about.\nHe wasn’t talking about my jacket or my helmet. Nah, he was eyeing my skis—my fresh pair of Romp Skis Osos , a freeriding ski handcrafted in Crested Butte.\nAs a liftie, I assume he sees a lot of skis, so I was a little startled. All I could think about was that meme. You know the one—the kids shouting “WHAT ARE THOSE?!” that started on Vine in like 2014, blew up in sneakerhead circles about a decade ago, and somehow still holds major staying power.\nTurns out, skis spark the same curiosity as new Jordans when you roll up with something that’s not a household name like Atomic, Salomon, or K2—the brands that practically define the sport.\nEarlier that morning, I had my bindings adjusted at the shop. The guy behind the counter took one look and hit me with the same question. “What are those?” Then, after a beat, he grinned and said, “Congrats, man. Those look fun.”\nHe made me feel like I had just bought a new car or proposed. I appreciated that.\nAnd honestly, he wasn’t wrong. Clicking into those 172 Romp Osos felt like trading in a Ford Focus for a brand-new Bronco Raptor with all the bells and whistles. On the first run, I squealed.\nI was charging instead of cruising, finding new precision, and a little extra confidence I probably didn’t deserve.\nThis is the Romp Skis experience in a nutshell. Small-batch. Handmade in America. Tough as heck. Totally dialed in. A complete blast to ride.\nThese things freakin’ rock.\nPlus, bonus points for the great conversation piece on the topic with lift strangers. In fact, in two days of skiing them at Mammoth, I didn’t find a single person who had even heard of Romps. In other words, an outstanding ski that fits whatever mid-life crisis you’re working through.\nSo it’s time skiers educate themselves on what these guys do differently.\nSo What Makes Romp Skis Different? Romp was by two brothers, Morgan and Caleb Weinberg, who got into making custom skis in Crested Butte when their construction jobs died down.\n“My brother and I had the dream of making our own skis, and the business side was almost an afterthought,” Morgan tells BroBible. “Once we started Romp I thought a lot about a story my dad told me about ordering a surfboard. He described his surfing style and the waves where he surfed to the shaper and the shaper built him a board for those specific conditions.”\n“I wanted to bring that experience to skiers,” he continues. “It means a lot to me to produce skis here in the US and even more so to be able to make skis in Crested Butte for Crested Butte locals.”\nHere’s what you have to know:\nCustom Fit, No Guesswork: Romp lets you customize everything—stiffness, rocker profiles, topsheets—so you get a ski that actually matches your style instead of guessing what might work. No more playing the demo game. You can learn more about the customization process on the Romp Skis websit e . Countervail Technology: This proprietary material is usually found in high-end tennis rackets and bikes, but Romp puts it in their skis to reduce weight and chatter. Translation: smooth rides, no annoying vibrations. Handcrafted in Crested Butte: There’s something cool about knowing your skis were built in a Colorado mountain town by guys who live and breathe skiing. No big factories, just quality craftsmanship. Guaranteed to Rip: Romp offers a ten-day satisfaction guarantee. Hate them? They’ll make you a new pair for free. Plus, they’ll replace your skis within a year if you wreck them—or give you a new set at half price. Eye-Catching Aesthetics: These skis turn heads. Whether it’s the guy on the lift or the shop tech adjusting your bindings, everyone wants to know what you’re riding. Versatile Performance: The Romp 89 is a prime example—lively edge-to-edge transitions, stable at speed, and playful in mixed conditions. It’s the perfect all-mountain ripper. The Romp Skis Experience: Romp Osos Compliments from strangers aside, I love how playful these skis are. They have just the right amount of zip while still letting me dig into turns in tight spaces.\nBack at the beginning of the season, I got the chance to test out Romps. They didn’t pay us or anything like that, just said “hey we want you to see why we stand up to our craftmanship here.”\nI went with the Romp OSOs because my go-to skis last season were the Atomic Bent 100s—gnarly old-man winter top sheet and all ( pic on my Instagram here ). I wasn’t sure what kind of skier I was besides the kind who wants to have the best day ever, which can mean a lot of things: Great snow, of course, or just having a great day ripping with my brother, my buddies, or flying solo in a spiritual commune with the mountain.\nI love my Atomic Bent 100s, but I also found myself obsessed with wanting to build a quiver, even though I don’t have a ton of space for it in my cramped Los Angeles apartment. I wanted something that could maneuver more playfully and handle tighter crags and trees—without sacrificing fun on blue cruiser runs.\nThe Romp OSOs deliver on that front. I found myself eyeing freerider skis a lot during our historic snowfalls in California last year. Great on groomers and off-piste, with a tight turning radius that keeps you off your heels.\nI noticed some chatter on the Bents and wanted something more nimble for powder stashes and unexpected terrain surprises. While I didn’t get any fresh powder on my first trip out in Mammoth, I can already see the vision of how they’ll perform when the snow gods finally deliver.\nvia Brandon Wenerd\nIn addition to the nice touch of being built in Crested Butte and tested on that legendary Colorado mountain’s steep, rocky terrain, Romp says the Osos were tested by the rippers at Western State University’s Freeride Team. They redesigned the Romp 106 Oso, which definitely good for charging, but you will shriek at the playfulness. With an increased taper, rocker in the tip and tail, and a 20-meter sidecut radius, these skis can bounce through tight chutes and stay solid when you decide to go full Warren Miller mode.\nThe Romp Ready version out of the box features a stout Ash/Aspen wood core and extra dampening material for a ride that’s smooth, predictable, and ready for anything—perfect for those who want their ride easy but their apres stories epic.\nThe Bottom Line Getting back into skiing after a long break turns you into a gearhead all over again. I love ski gear, and I’ve loved falling back in love with it—especially gear that stands out from the crowd. I want something with an edge, something that makes me feel like I’m experiencing this absurd sport—strapping expensive planks to my feet and launching myself down frozen mountains—in a completely new way.\nEven if you’re carving up Aspen or Deer Valley swaged out in Moncler, seasoned skiers know it’s all about having an aura that’s uniquely yours. Your gear should match your vibe. Mine? Small, indie, and fun—like an underground band only true fans know about.\nI think, even after two days in my Romps, I’m all-in on ski businesses with backstories and aspirations. It’s fun to build lore as legendary as the alpinists who turned old mining towns into ski meccas. Heritage has to start somewhere, after all.\nPlus, I love the patriotic vibe of a made-in-America ski brand, especially because most of the major equipment makers are European to the core.\nAt the end of the day, Romps are for the skier who wants something different—something with personality, performance, and a little mystique. They’re for the skier who loves the journey of discovering the perfect line, the perfect day, and the perfect ski.\nWhether you’re a weekend warrior, a powder hound, or just someone who loves making fresh turns, Romp delivers an experience that feels uniquely yours.\nSure, the classic brands are great—they’re classics for a reason—but there’s something special about discovering a pair of skis that feels uniquely yours—like stumbling on a killer vinyl in a bin, buying it on a whim, and realizing it’s exactly what you needed. Think about it like having Pinky Floyd’s Dark Side Of The Moon *and* Obscured By Clouds in your record collection.\nSo next time someone asks, “What are those?!” you’ll have the perfect answer.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help. Pedaling kindness: Massachusetts Peloton group leaves servers $7,200 tip 'Feed somebody you don’t know': Philadelphia man inspires, heals through food Why strangers raised $450,000 to help a dependable Burger King worker buy his first home Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
