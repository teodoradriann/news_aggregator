    "text": "Man sought in connection with vandalism of churches in custody A man Philadelphia police were seeking after they say he vandalized several buildings and churches is in police custody, officials said. But, after causing a great deal of damage in several locations.\nPHILADELPHIA - A man Philadelphia police were seeking after they say vandalized several buildings and churches, causing tens of thousands of dollars, is in police custody, officials said. But, after causing a great deal of damage in several locations.\nA half a brick and two stones were thrown through some of the most expensive kinds of windows of one of the most sacred places in the city, the National Shrine of Saint John Neumann, along Girard Avenue. They were thrown with such force, they went through two panes of stained-glass, bending the steel lattice holding the glass pieces together and heading into the pews.\n\"One of the rocks actually went across the center aisle, went through two panes of glass and traversed half the church itself,\" Pastor of St. Peter the Apostle Church, Father Michael Cunningham, said.\nThe force shattered the glass on three of the windows and shattered the peace the solemn, holy historic church provides.\nFather Cunningham continued, \"It’s a difficult thing to see. This really is an oasis. We live in a very busy city and all the hectic mess of the world is sort of left when people come into this oasis and experience the tranquility.\"\nThis was the second church struck by the same man, on the same day, detectives say. Mother Bethel AME Church, in Society Hill, on South 6th Street also had stained-glass windows shattered and boarded up Monday.\nThe vandal didn’t stop with the two churches, however.\n\"There’s along list of places now,\" Philadelphia Police Central Detectives, Captain Frank Banford, said. \"There’s at least six places in addition to the two churches.\"\nDetectives say clear, color surveillance at one of the 10 spots where windows were smashed helped aid them in the man’s apprehension. He is seen with items tucked under his Phillies cap. Police learned he’s a SEPTA rider.\n\"We were tracking him through SEPTA,\" Captain Banford added. \"He appears to be coming from the far Northeast. He takes buses, he takes the Frankford El and gets off in Center City.\"\n\"To do something like that, it&apos;s coming from a place I would imagine of great despair and difficulty in life,\" Father Cunningham added.\nOfficials said the man was taken into custody at the Frankford Transportation Center.",

    "text": "From treating yourself to a solo dinner at a restaurant to strolling around a museum, venturing out alone can be daunting. But after three weeks in Dublin and a solo trip to Luxembourg, I’d say first-year me would be proud.\nHaving done extensive research before my arrival, I was eager to get to Dublin’s must-see spots. I was well prepared to do so alone, reflecting on all of the experiences I missed out on during my first semester at college because I didn’t know anyone and was scared to go by myself.\nMore than anything, I appreciate the flexibility and freedom of navigating Dublin on my own.\nOne of my first stops was the National Gallery of Ireland, which I’ve been to twice now. It was nice to explore at my own pace with the audio tour, pausing at each work of art without feeling rushed.\nI’ve also been to the National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology and the National Museum of Ireland - Decorative Arts and History, where I’ve learned more about Irish history and its culture.\nTaking advantage of the last few days of warm weather, I’ve also spent a lot of time in parks, like Phoenix Park, Merrion Square Park and St. Stephen’s Green — my personal favorite. I’ve learned the most about daily life through these green spaces, people-watching as I go for long strolls.\nAimlessly wandering around Dublin also led me to hidden gems, like Marsh’s Library and a beautiful flower shop called Howbert & Mays. I may have missed these spots had I been walking and talking with others or glued to a fixed plan.\nMy biggest solo adventure by far was a 24-hour trip to Luxembourg. This small country nestled between Belgium, France and Germany boasts a rich history and stunning architecture.\nThough I never imagined myself visiting, I was quickly convinced by a 35 euro round-trip ticket for a flight just a few days away.\nWhat initially seemed scary and impulsive — navigating a country where I didn’t speak the language and staying in a hostel for the first time — quickly became one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.\nAfter checking into my hostel, I walked to what many call “the most beautiful balcony in Europe.” The view of a neighborhood called the Grund from the Chemin de la Corniche was one of the most breathtaking views I've ever seen.\nI then spent some time learning about the country’s culture and history in the National Art and History Museum, before spending hours exploring the city where I came across many beautiful buildings, monuments and charming shops before dinner\nThe next morning, I enjoyed a blueberry cinnamon bun and a unique, beetroot flavored cinnamon latte at Cinnamood before heading back to Dublin that afternoon.\nOn the way back to Dublin, I felt so much gratitude as I reflected on all I discovered about these new places and myself in just three weeks. Though not without its challenges, solitude is important and insightful.\nEmbrace it.\nMORE COLUMNS\nEditor’s note: The opinions expressed in this column are the columnist’s own. They are not r…",

    "text": "ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — For the first time, we're hearing from the mother of the 6-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in a Martin County car crash in September.\nLaw enforcement said the crash was caused by Ryan Routh , the man charged in the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump in Palm Beach County,\nProsecutors said Routh led authorities on a chase on Interstate 95, which caused law enforcement to close the road on the day of the incident.\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody said this week that during the apprehension and arrest of Routh, a car crash occurred that caused serious injuries to Mia Rosalie Monreal, a 6-year-old Port St. Lucie girl.\nMia was in a coma after the wreck and is still hospitalized in Jacksonville.\nZoom Norka Pardo speaks from hospital about her daughter's condition. \"I usually read a lot to her, I sing to her to let her know mommy is here, you're not alone,\" said Norka Pardo, Mia's mom.\nPardo said she was in the car with Mia, her youngest son and her boyfriend when the crash happened. She said she fractured her arm and had a concussion.\n\"All I was doing was asking about the kids and the nurses were trying to calm me down, and telling me we're worried about you right now,\" said Pardo.\nMia was airlifted to HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital for surgery and then went to St. Mary's Medical Center for a month and a half.\nPardo said Mia suffered a severe brain injury and was in a coma for a month. On Wednesday, Mia was transferred to a Jacksonville hospital for therapy.\n\"She was not responding, she's not waking up at all, so they have to kind of help her out and give her medication to help her brain restart,\" Pardo said. \"She's kind of opening her eyes, closing to fall asleep, opening her eyes but there was no response.\"\nDespite living in St. Lucie County, Pardo said she's taken off work to be by her daughter's side.\nWATCH: Ryan Routh to face charges in Martin County\nWhy Ryan Routh now faces state charges in Martin County \"Have you been able to have a clear conversation with her in the last three months?\" asked WPTV reporter Joel Lopez.\n\"No and she can't communicate so even when I talk to her, I don't even know if she remembers me I don't know if she knows who I am, I don't know,\" said Pardo. \"It's a miracle she's still alive, I can't imagine what she was going through and how she almost didn't make it.\"\nShe said Mia was very energetic and had dreams of being a gymnast. She said Mia was also very protective of her younger brother who is on the autism spectrum.\n\"I do have breakdowns very often. It's really hard also not being home with my other two kids,\" said Pardo. \"Before the accident, I've always been a very overprotective mother and now I have to let go of that, because I can't be there for my little one and my oldest, because I have to be here with her.\"\nOn Wednesday Attorney General Ashley Moody was in Martin County to announce additional attempted murder charges against Ryan Routh.\nProvided by family Norka Pardo with her daughter, Mia, and family. \"When you couple those terrible injuries together with his other criminal conduct, which we believe rises to the level of domestic terrorism, it turns his actions into an attempted felony murder case,\" Moody said.\nRouth remains in federal custody.\n\"None of that is going to fix anything,\" said Pardo. \"She's still in the hospital, we're still going through this, but I just hope he pays for what he did.\"\nRight now, Mia's future is uncertain, but the family is planning on visiting her in the hospital in Jacksonville for Christmas.\nIf you'd like to help the family and Mia in her recovery, click the link here .",
