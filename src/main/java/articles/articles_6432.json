    "title": "Russia says it halted a Ukrainian incursion into its territory. Evidence suggests it hasn’t",
    "text": "(CNN) — Ukrainian forces are pushing further into the Kursk region of Russia, in a cross-border incursion that surprised even American officials, multiple US and Ukrainian officials tell CNN.\nUkrainian forces are comprised of a mix of Ukrainian regular and special operations units, unlike previous Ukrainian operations inside Russia that often involved undercover units and local sympathizers.\nThe intention, say US and Ukrainian officials, is multifaceted, in part to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces and in part to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long-term.\nThis comes after Russia claimed on Thursday to have halted a Ukrainian incursion into its territory, although latest evidence from the ground suggests fighting continues in the Kursk region.\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said units of the “North” group of its forces, together with the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, “continue to destroy Ukrainian armed forces formations in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, which are directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border.”\nUkraine has not officially confirmed its forces conducted a ground operation inside Russia. Neither the Ukrainian military nor the government in Kyiv has publicly commented on the operation.\nRussia accused Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into its Kursk region on Tuesday, claiming that Ukrainian forces launched a “massive attack” and attempted to break through the Russian defenses.\nThe extent of the attack, including whether Ukrainian troops took over any settlements or caused damage to any strategic targets, remains unclear.\nThe Russian state news agency TASS on Thursday quoted the Russian Health Ministry as saying 34 people were injured in the shelling of the Kursk region were “undergoing inpatient treatment,” with nine evacuated to Moscow for treatment.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on Thursday that residents of the region who have been forced to leave their homes would be given a one-time payment of 10,000 rubles ($115).\nCNN has geolocated video footage from inside a car that is being driven quickly through the deserted and damaged streets of the town of Sudzha, 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border. Some wrecked vehicles are also seen in the video as the car moves north out of the town. It’s unclear whether the video was shot Wednesday or Thursday.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said “attempts by individual [Ukrainian] units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being thwarted.”\nIt claimed that the Ukrainians had “lost up to 400 servicemen and 32 armoured vehicles, including a tank, four armoured personnel carriers, three infantry fighting vehicles and 24 Kozak armoured fighting vehicles.” The ministry’s claims cannot be verified.\nRussian military bloggers have described the situation as difficult, with communications jammed. One prominent blogger was seriously injured Wednesday when his vehicle was struck.\nMick Ryan, author of the Futura Doctrina blog and an analyst of the war in Ukraine, said Thursday that the Ukrainian military had deployed “quality formations. It appears that unlike in the 2023 southern counteroffensive where fresh brigades were employed, the Ukrainians have allocated experienced formations to this attack. This already appears to be paying dividends with the depth of the Ukrainian penetration so far.”\nThe US-based conflict monitoring group the Institute for the Study of War said in its assessment on Thursday that “Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers” into the Kursk region on Wednesday.\nKyiv remains silent on incursion claims\nUkraine’s allies have not commented on the situation beyond saying the country has the right to defend itself. The EU’s foreign affairs and security policy spokesperson Peter Stano told the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that according to the international law, Kyiv “has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.”\nThe White House was taken by surprise by the developments on Wednesday, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters that it was not told ahead of time, adding that the Biden administration was “going to reach out to the Ukrainian military to learn more about their objectives.”\nJean-Pierre said the US was “supportive of Ukraine as they are defending themselves against Russia’s aggression.”\n“And so, we’re going to continue to do that. And they are going to take actions … to certainly to protect themselves from these attacks,” she added.\nBut as for the specific operation, we’re going to reach out to them to see what their objective is and continue to stay focused. We are going to continue to stay focused on making sure they have what they need to defend themselves against Russia’s aggression.\nUkrainian troops have found themselves under increased pressure along the 600-mile frontline as Moscow continues its\nslow, grinding offensive.\nRussian troops have recently made incremental advances towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, threatening a vital Ukrainian supply line. At the same time, Russian forces claim to have seized the village of Niu York and are getting closer to Toretsk.\nKyiv has started receiving new tranches of the long-delayed US military assistance in May, but is still facing troop shortages because many of its newly recruited soldiers are still in training.\nThe Ukraine Military Intelligence said on Thursday that its forces raided the Russian-occupied Tendra Spit on Tuesday, destroying Russian armoured vehicles, an electronic warfare system, and fortifications. The narrow island in the northern part of the Black Sea is about 40 miles long and about 1 mile wide.\nUkrainian special forces destroyed Russian “equipment, personnel, and fortifications” during the raid, HUR said, adding that among the destroyed were armored vehicles, in particular MT-LB amphibious personnel carriers, electronic warfare complex and fortifications.\nHUR claimed Russian forces suffered losses among the personnel, without providing any further details. There were no losses among the Ukrainian forces, it said.\nAn incursion into Russia could be an attempt by Kyiv to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the frontline, the news of a successful incursion help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population.\nIt could also be a message to Russia’s civilian population – a demonstration that Moscow’s war on Ukraine makes Russia vulnerable to attacks.\nA Russian military blogger Rybar reported on Wednesday that the Ukrainian military had established control over a gas transit station near the border. The blogger said the station is the only one through which gas from Russia flows to Ukraine and then to Europe. CNN cannot confirm that reporting.\nThe European Union has imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Russia – with the exception of key natural gas imports. The EU was dependent on Russian gas and while it has slashed imports from Russia from 45% of all gas imports in 2021, to 15% of EU gas imports in 2023, some Russian gas still continues to flow to Europe through Ukraine, despite the war.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Recent rains and cooler weather are helping more than 1000 firefighters gain ground on two wildfires in southern New Mexico that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee.\nFire crews took advantage of temperatures in the 70s, scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso.\nThe South Fork Fire, which reached 67 square kilometres, was 26% contained, while the Salt Fire, at 31 square kilometres, was 7% contained as of Saturday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre.\nFull containment was not expected until July 15, per the agency.\nElsewhere in New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and communities near Albuquerque, about 320 kilometres north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there on Saturday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFlash flood warnings were cancelled Saturday, though the National Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and more flooding in the area.\nThe wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1400 structures. Other fallout from the fires — including downed power lines, damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars — continued “to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.\nEvacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.\n“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook.\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\nDeanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, met with Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Crawford and Mescalero Apache President Thora Walsh Padilla on Saturday. “These communities have our support for as long as it takes to recover,” Criswell posted on the social media platform X.\nMuch of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical centre and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 8660 square kilometres this year — a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre.",

(BBC) What did you miss?\nDragons' Den star Gary Neville confessed he was at risk of bursting into tears as he considered investing in an enthusiastic young entrepreneur.\nThe football pundit returned to the Den as a guest investor where he made a £50k offer in sports recovery company Myo Master , run by couple Lottie and Joe. While all the Dragons felt the sports massage and ice bath market was over crowded, they couldn't help being won over by enthusiastic Lottie who turned every criticism fired at her into a positive.\nWhat, how, and why? Gary Neville returned to Dragon's Den. (BBC) Retired footballer told Neville said: \"I think you've picked market that is packed and busy and competitive. You've not got your technology away yet and it's not been designed. But Joe I like your story and Lottie you are unbelievable. You are a class act and I've never met anybody under interrogation... and you're getting emotional which is pushing me over the edge.\" He took a deep breath and laughed: \"Never make an emotional investment!\"\nBut he went on: \"So I will offer you half the money, but I want another Dragon in with me.\"\nPeter Jones, Deborah Meaden and Sara Davies all made the couple competitive offers of the full £100k they were seeking, and after conferring at the back of the Den they asked Davies if she would team up with Neville on the investment.\nDavies said: \"I would love to work with Gary and he has a lot more knowledge in this market than I do.\" Neville agreed: \"I'm happy.\"\nAs former rugby player Joe and Lottie left the Den, Neville said: \"I've never met anyone like her in my life.\" Davies admitted: \"We haven't had anyone like her in the Den. Good partnership.\"\nWhat else happened on Dragons' Den? Dragons' Den star Sara Davies teamed up with other dragons for several investments. (BBC) Jayne Sibley and Marty Orton tugged on the Dragons' heart strings with their business Sibstar - a debit card and app for sufferers of dementia and their families, which has already [partnered with the Alzheimer's Society and Mastercard.\nStory continues Neville told them: \"I love the fact that you've set up this business from a personal story. I actually donated 50 per cent of the profits form my media platform to the Alzheimer's Society. I've got a personal interest in this from my background in football.\" He added: \"Can I tell you where I'm at? I've got a great love of your story and I just worry what I as an investor would be able to bring to this particular company? So for that reason I'm out.\"\nSteven Bartlett confessed he was torn as to whether he wanted to get involved with their business as a matter of the heart or a business decision. He said he wished he could donate to their cause, but he didn't see it as an investable business. And Peter Jones and Touker Souleyman both commended their efforts and also declared themselves out.\nBut Deborah Meaden and Sara Davies both decided that though the banking sector was a risky business the wanted to invest and both offered £62.5k for five per cent of the business, working together.\nDavies told them: \"I feel like I want to say on behalf of all the families going through this a massive thank you. I think it's wrong the banks aren't tackling this and I take my hat off to you.\"\nAs the couple left the Den Neville said: \"Did you see the hug?\" Davies told him: Do you know what Gary? That is the best part of this job and seeing what it does to people.\"\nDragon's Den airs on BBC One at 8pm on Thursday.\nRead more: Dragons' Den The most successful products from Dragons' Den and where to buy them (Bradford Telegraph and Argus, 3 min read)\nDragons' Den: BBC adds disclaimer to episode criticised for claim that ear seeds can help recovery from ME (Deadline, 2 min read)\nDragons' Den stars secure offer 'because of Meghan Markle' (The Independent, 2 min read)\nTRENDING 1.
