MIRA AQUÍ: [Israel intensifica su ofensiva en el sur de Gaza pese a advertencias de Estados Unidos] Cada 24 de diciembre, Belén -centro de la comunidad cristiana palestina- celebra un tradicional desfile con bandas de música, previo a la llegada del Patriarca Latino de Jerusalén a pie para oficiar una misa en la Iglesia de Santa Catalina, la parte católica basílica de la Natividad. Pero este año, el patriarca Pierbattista Pizzaballa -el enviado religioso del Vaticano a Tierra Santa- llegará a Belén en una procesión solemne, sin música ni actos festivos, de luto por el alto número de muertos palestinos en la guerra en la Franja de Gaza, que superan los 20.200 mientras prosigue la ofensiva israelí. Cisjordania ocupada también ha vivido su año más mortífero desde 2002, el pico de violencia de la Segunda Intifada, con unos 510 muertos, más de la mitad desde el 7 de octubre, cuando comenzó la guerra en el enclave. Abbas expresó hoy, día de Nochebuena, su esperanza de que esta Navidad marque el cese de la guerra israelí contra el pueblo palestino en Gaza y el resto de territorios palestinos ocupados, deseando “prosperidad y estabilidad para el pueblo palestino y todas las naciones”. MÁS INFORMACIÓN: [Netanyahu dice que Israel paga “un alto precio” por los soldados muertos en Gaza] “El sol de la libertad y [nuestro] Estado independiente con Jerusalén como capital está inevitablemente surgiendo, casi a nuestro alcance”, afirmó el presidente en su discurso de Navidad. “El pueblo palestino está decidido a continuar su lucha para lograr sus derechos legítimos, el principal de los cuales es el derecho a un Estado independiente y plenamente soberano, donde puedan vivir con dignidad en su patria”, agregó. El presidente palestino también rindió homenaje a los miles de “mártires de Palestina”, deseó una pronta recuperación para los heridos, libertad para los prisioneros y oró por la preservación del pueblo palestino en Gaza, Cisjordania, Jerusalén y la diáspora.

    "text": "Myne Global Redefines Asset Protection: A New Era for Securing Physical and Digital Valuables 04-23-2025 10:56 PM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nImage: https://www.abnewswire.com/upload/2025/04/44aad271495013a381779546e606bb86.jpg\nAs the distinction between the physical and digital becomes more unclear, protecting assets-whether it's a unique classic car or an exclusive digital collectible-has grown more complicated. Myne Global [ https://myneglobal.com/ ] is stepping up to face this challenge, pioneering in the realm of comprehensive asset protection. The company combines advanced security technologies with a user-centric platform that offers reassurance in uncertain times.\nA New Paradigm in Asset Protection\nMyne Global is more than a typical security service-it's a comprehensive ecosystem designed to address the changing needs of asset owners in the 21st century. Its fundamental philosophy is straightforward yet transformative: asset protection must go beyond physical limits, and digital proof of ownership should be globally verifiable, safe, and easily accessible.\nThrough the smooth integration of physical and digital security strategies, Myne Global assists users in protecting their valuables from various threats, such as theft, loss, destruction, fraud, and counterfeit distribution. Whether it's a high-end watch, an exquisite art collection, or a digital asset, Myne Global provides a comprehensive platform to safeguard, oversee, and confirm ownership with assurance.\nRobust, User-Centric Features\nMyne Global's strength is in its large feature set, each one meant to provide practical use while upholding the best security criteria. These features are designed for both people and companies, so the platform can fit different needs:\n1. Tamper-Proof Digital Asset Registration\nUsers can digitally document their physical and intangible assets, hence producing an unchangeable, verifiable ownership record. In situations of legal conflicts, resale, or insurance claims-providing a basis of confidence supported by full transparency and integrity-this becomes all the more important.\n2. Secure Inventory Management System\nAssets can be carefully organized with images, thorough descriptions, purchase records, and additional information. All information is kept in a secure cloud vault, providing users with centralized access to their asset details at any time and from any location.\n3. Real-Time Theft Reporting\nIn case of theft, users can promptly report the situation via the platform. This alert is communicated to the pertinent law enforcement agencies, facilitating recovery operations and minimizing the chances of unauthorized resale.\n4. Global Asset Tracking Capabilities\nWith a growing international partner network, Myne Global enables cross-border tracking of stolen or missing assets. Owners receive global support, ensuring assets are protected even beyond their home country.\n5. Streamlined Insurance Claims\nOften, insurance claims are delayed by insufficient documentation or confirmation of ownership. Myne Global overcomes this problem by providing verified, time-stamped documents that enable more open, quicker, and simpler claim processing.\n6. Verified Ownership Certificates\nMyne Global increases trust and authenticity by providing verified certifications for registered objects, hence improving resale value and guaranteeing consumers confidence in the validity of their purchases.\nProtecting a Wide Spectrum of Assets\nUnlike traditional asset protection services that focus solely on physical goods, Myne Global's innovation lies in its multi-domain approach. The platform accommodates a diverse range of asset categories:\n*\nLuxury Watches & Jewelry - Secure registration reduces the risk of black-market resale.\n*\nFine Art & Collectibles - Provenance verification protects against forgery and theft.\n*\nAutomobiles & Classic Vehicles - Inventory tools and geo-tracking boost security for high-value cars.\n*\nDesigner Goods & Rare Items - From limited-edition sneakers to trading cards, authenticity is verifiable with a click.\nFortified by Next-Generation Security\nAt the core of Myne Global's infrastructure lies an advanced collection of cybersecurity tools aimed at safeguarding data and assets:\n*\nEnd-to-end encryption protects every piece of data, guaranteeing that only permitted users can access it.\n*\nDecentralized Architecture reduces the risk linked to centralized failure points and makes it considerably harder for unauthorized access to occur.\n*\nProactive Monitoring and Updates guarantee the platform stays robust against new cyber threats while adhering to industry best practices.\nBuilt on Privacy and Equal Access\nMyne Global takes a principled stance on user privacy and fairness. Without clear permission, customer data is never disclosed to outside parties; every user-regardless of the financial worth of their assets-receives equal protection. Myne Global is meant to operate with honesty and openness whether you are a small business, an art gallery, or a person protecting sensitive items.\nThousands of individuals and companies are turning to Myne Global as their trusted asset protection partner. Here's what makes the platform indispensable:\n*\nEnd-to-end protection for both physical and digital assets\n*\nSeamless theft reporting directly integrated with law enforcement databases\n*\nHassle-free insurance claim support\n*\nVerified ownership boosts credibility in secondary markets\n*\nConstant innovation with a relentless focus on digital security\nLooking to the Future\nAs the security landscape evolves, so does Myne Global. The company is actively broadening its international presence and investing in advanced technologies.\nThrough partnerships with insurers, law enforcement, and technology specialists, Myne Global is establishing a new benchmark in asset protection-where transparency, trust, and innovation come together.\nMyne Global [ https://myneglobal.com/ ] shines as a beacon of safety and creativity in a world where assets are more varied than ever and dangers are more complex. It's empowering people and companies to seize control of their ownership, identity, and legacy, not only safeguarding what is important.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Myne Global\nContact Person: Support\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=myne-global-redefines-asset-protection-a-new-era-for-securing-physical-and-digital-valuables ]\nCity: Los Angeles\nState: California\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://myneglobal.com\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.

    "text": "Israel used a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly U.N. school strike in Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel, and NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military made improper use of a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly airstrike Thursday on a United Nations school compound in Gaza, according to current and former U.S. defense officials who analyzed an image of the bomb remnants documented by NPR at the site. The munition used was a GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, according to a Pentagon official and a former U.S. Air Force official. It is the same kind of bomb, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-rafah-bombs.html) The New York Times, that Israel used in an airstrike last month that killed dozens of displaced civilians at a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, an incident Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu called](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/27/nx-s1-4982787/israeli-strike-kills-dozens-45-in-an-area-of-rafah-that-didnt-get-evacuation-orders) a “tragic mishap.” Israel’s army said it was targeting a group of militants inside two classrooms at a U.N. school in Nuseirat, a central Gaza refugee camp. But the 2 a.m. strike killed at least 32 people, including seven children, according to Dr. Khalil Doqran, director of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza. Families displaced in the war are sheltering in the school. At the hospital morgue, NPR documented one body bag labeled as containing the body parts of five children. The Israeli army said the militants it was targeting had participated in the deadly Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel and were plotting attacks from inside the school. Army spokesman Peter Lerner said the military called off the strike twice to minimize collateral damage, and that he was unaware of any civilian casualties in the strike. The Pentagon official told NPR that Israel had used the bomb improperly because the bomb is intended to cause low collateral damage but caused a high number of casualties. “Israel is using the most advanced, precise and effective bombs the U.S. produces like a cudgel,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Israel’s conduct. Wes Bryant, the former Air Force official, said the U.S. military would have most likely called off such a strike where militants were holed up in a U.N. school housing displaced civilians because the estimated number of civilian casualties would be high. “What strikes me most about these most recent strikes by the IDF [Israeli military], in which large numbers of civilians have again been killed, is that they are using munitions intended to be both precision and low collateral damage — but they are not employing them in a manner in which those qualities are applied,” said Bryant, a retired master sergeant and former special operations joint terminal attack controller in the elite special warfare branch of the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. State Department called on Israel to name those killed in the strike. The Israeli military declined NPR's request for comment on the kind of munitions used, but identified the names of nine men it said were militants killed in the strike. The U.N. school in Nuseirat is sheltering families that had been displaced multiple times: those who fled north Gaza to Rafah in south Gaza at the start of the war, and who then fled Israel’s offensive on Rafah to the U.N. school. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said the school compound is sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the moment. “Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,” he [said in a statement](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1798681289052283206) on the social media platform X. One family had reached the school two weeks ago and was killed while they were sleeping, relatives told NPR. In the aftermath of the strike, rubble covered the school courtyard and blood covered the school staircase. Two boys with head and leg injuries remained in the school compound. Children were collecting wood from among the rubble to use as firewood, and U.N. officials were trying to repair a door and windows of the compound for families still sheltering there. At the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital morgue, a mother grieved over her dead son’s body. The hospital director said more than 140 people have been killed since Wednesday in central Gaza as Israel launched a new offensive in the area. “The scene inside the emergency room inside Al-Aqsa Hospital is even worse than yesterday. They have no chance to reorganize from ... yesterday’s events, and now they are struck with mass casualties after mass casualties,” said Karin Huster, a medical adviser for humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, who is at the hospital. “Patients are on the floor. There is blood everywhere ... dead bodies are not being taken to the morgue because the facility is overwhelmed.” NPR's Daniel Estrin reported from Tel Aviv; NPR producer Anas Baba reported from Gaza.

Ciencia » Salud Psicología Tecnología Mundo La transferencia de un resort de Abjasia a Rusia desata las tensiones políticas en Georgia Agencias @DiarioSigloXXI jueves, 28 de diciembre de 2023, 21:03 h (CET) MADRID, 28 (EUROPA PRESS) La decisión de la autoproclamada República de Abjasia, ubicada en el noroeste de Georgia y afín a Moscú, de trasferir un resort de la localidad de Pitsunda a Rusia ha desatado nuevamente las tensiones políticas entre el gobernante Sueño Georgiano y el opositor Movimiento Nacional Unido. \"La oposición utilizará esto sólo para agravar la situación y culpar a Sueño Georgiano de la ocupación. Dirá que la continuación de esta ocupación es culpa nuestra\", ha señalado el diputado Irakli Kadagishvili de Sueño Georgiano, según ha recogido Interpress News. La oposición culpa al partido de las acciones de Rusia, especialmente después de que el presidente de Abjasia, Aslan Bzhania, acordara con las autoridades rusas el establecimiento de una base militar de la Armada de Rusia en la región de Ochamchira, en el mar Negro. La transferencia de terreno incluye no solo el resort, de 180 hectáreas y construido en los años 50 por el dirigente soviético Nikita Jrushchov, sino también la zona de mar adyacente y parte de la carretera para entrar al complejo. En la víspera, la presidenta de Georgia, Salomé Zurabishvili, condenó en la red social X la decisión y pidió a la comunidad internacional una \"respuesta fuerte y urgente\" ante lo que definió como una \"política de anexión progresiva\" por parte de Moscú. De la misma forma, el Ministerio de Exteriores georgiano aseguró que este paso es \"otro acto ilegal\" que \"viola flagrantemente los principios fundamentales del Derecho Internacional\". \"El acuerdo no tiene fuerza legal y es nulo\", resaltó. El presidente de la autoproclamada República de Abjasia, Aslan Bzhania, firmó en la víspera un proyecto de ley aprobado por el Parlamento después de que las partes acordaran el pasado 19 de enero dicha transferencia. El expresidente georgiano Mijail Saakashvili, que lideró Movimiento Nacional Unido y que se encuentra ahora cumpliendo una condena de seis años por dos casos de abuso de poder, impuso durante sus mandatos varias reformas de acercamiento a Occidente y protagonizó una breve guerra con Rusia en 2008 que desembocó en la pérdida de las regiones de Osetia del Sur y Abjasia. Tras acabar el conflicto, Moscú, cuyas fuerzas se impusieron, reconoció a ambas regiones separatistas como países independientes, si bien la inmensa mayoría de los países no lo han hecho.

    "title": "Sir Nicholas Winton - The 'British Schindler': How on the eve of the Second World War, a quiet Home Counties stockbroker rescued hundreds of young lives from Nazi persecution | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Nicky Winton was a 29-year-old London stockbroker in 1938. He was the child of Jewish refugees, from a family that had left Germany for England in the 1870s. As war once again loomed over Europe, a friend alerted him to the refugee crisis in Prague, triggered by Britain’s signing of the Munich Agreement (that permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and Nazi Germany’s subsequent occupation of it). Winton volunteered to spend a week or two helping refugees, but when he saw first-hand how desperate and dangerous their situation was, he decided he had to try to change things. The kindertransport trains were bringing Jewish children out of Germany and Austria, but no refugees were being accepted from Czechoslovakia, mainly because the British government did not judge people there to be in any danger. The kindertransport programme saved the lives of nearly 10,000 young Winton in 1939, with a child rescued from Czechoslovakia. Winton found thousands of refugees, many of them children, living in open fields and ruined buildings around Prague, facing a brutal winter and the threat of Nazi invasion. Most were Jewish. Some were children of those who had opposed Hitler and were now in hiding. Winton was adamant that he wanted to save children ‘of all faiths and none’, that every life was equal. He set about raising funds and negotiating with the Home Office to allow the children into temporary refuge in Britain. And to those who told him it was impossible, he answered simply that he was determined to try. This film project first landed in my inbox with a script and a link to a YouTube clip from the BBC ’s That’s Life! programme in 1988, when Winton was interviewed by Esther Rantzen . In it, she asks the assembled audience if anyone who owes their life to him is present. One by one, every adult in the room stands. It’s a piece of TV history that goes viral several times a year. The raw, understated emotion of the moment where Winton realises the impact of all that he achieved decades before, at the outbreak of war, is deeply moving. I’ve watched it a hundred times and it still gives me goosebumps – if you haven’t seen it, you need to. I dare you not to cry. Winton in 1998, at Prague’s main railway station That YouTube clip is both a gift and a challenge for a director. How do you re-create such an iconic screen moment? How do you add to it – if you even can? Well, casting Sir Anthony Hopkins is a good place to start. As he and I discussed how we would approach the film, he talked of the extraordinary humility that Winton emanates, the emotions all so controlled. No dramas. You do the thing because it is decent and right. My crew set out to make it as authentic as possible, from the costumes to the detail of every passport stamp and, where we could, shooting scenes in the locations where the real events took place. Early in our preparations, we were on reconnaissance in Prague, at the central station where most of the children boarded their trains towards England. At the end of the platform stands a bronze statue of Winton with two of the children he saved. We stopped to take photos when suddenly there were shouts, radios squawking, children crying. Police were escorting a crowd across the platforms. And then we realised these were refugees; dozens of women and children, newly arrived from Ukraine , dragging a few precious belongings with them. We all stood very quietly to take it in. Here we were, preparing to tell a story of another war and other refugees from more than 80 years ago, and history was repeating itself in front of us. It was a chilling moment. What would Winton have thought? For the scenes where the children say a last goodbye as they boarded the trains, the original archive tended to show lots of happy faces, excited by the newsreel camera, smiling awkwardly. I decided to reference more contemporary sources, so looked at photojournalism from Ukraine and re-created images of parents waving goodbye to their children in 2022: an adult hand over a child’s hand through the window, faces pressed to the glass. It’s only a detail but it makes the film speak subtly more to ‘now’. A new film featuring Winton's heroic efforts and starring Sir Anthony Hopkins will be released in cinemas on New Year’s Day Today, with world news so full of conflict, it is all too easy to feel overwhelmed, to have every excuse to think it’s more than any one individual can hope to influence, that nothing you could do would make a dent in the crisis. But Winton, who died in 2015 at the age of 106, thought differently. His story is all about possibility and hope. Johnny Flynn as the young Winton in One Life Does the film work? You, the audience, will be the judge of that. But the now Dame Esther Rantzen has seen it and given us her approval – and that matters personally. You see, this director’s second ever job in the industry was as a trainee researcher on That’s Life! , so Esther was my boss. Now, decades later, I got to direct ‘her’. Perhaps more significantly, the film has been seen by both Winton’s family and some of the surviving children who first arrived at Liverpool Street Station over 84 years ago. One, Lord Dubs, wrote that he watched the film with tears streaming, because this was his life story we were telling, dramatising the moment he left his parents at Prague station. He added that when he saw Anthony Hopkins on the screen as Winton, he had to pinch himself to remember that it wasn’t the real hero he was watching. Humbly, we’ll take that. One Life will be in cinemas from 1 January",
