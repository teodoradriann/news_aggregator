    "title": "PHOTOS: Transportation and Ticket Center Security Line Stretches Into Parking Lot With Only One Lane Open During ... - WDW News Today",
    "text": "It’s been a rainy day at Walt Disney World. With such poor weather, there weren’t many guests at Magic Kingdom, and only one security line has been operating at the Transportation and Ticket Center. This is where most guests go through security screening before entering the park. Unfortunately, as the rain has subsided, crowds of guests have arrived but only one line remains open.\nTransportation and Ticket Center Security Line\nWhen we were leaving the Transportation and Ticket Center between 1:00 p.m. and 1:20 p.m., the security line stretched under the bridge and into the disability parking lot.\nGuests who took a tram from their car were being dropped off close to the security station but then had to walk back to the end of this line.\nA Cast Member told us that there was a fire code in one of the parking lots that pulled several security officers away from the Transportation and Ticket Center.\nGuests rushing to the back of the line also led some trams to make emergency stops due to danger.\nHopefully, another security screening station will open soon and the long line will be resolved.\nAll guests must go through security screening. In addition to the Transportation and Ticket Center, there are smaller security stations at the nearby resorts for park guests to go through.\nFor the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow\nWDW News Today on\nRelated posts:\nREVIEW: Mickey Mousse Ornament Treat From Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic KingdomNovember 8, 2022 PHOTOS: Three Little Pigs, Mulan, and Mushu Greet Guests for Lunar New Year at Disney California Adv...January 30, 2022 DeSantis' Central Florida Tourism Oversight District to Void Disney's Land Use Agreement and More at...April 20, 2023",

    "title": "‘No better feeling’, says Sancho after firing Dortmund into last eight",
    "text": "AFP – Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho said there was “no better feeling” after his goal helped secure a 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven and progress to the Champions League quarter-finals late on Wednesday. The Manchester United loanee opened the scoring in the third minute, his first goal in front of Dortmund’s 82,000-strong home crowd since May 2021. Marco Reus added a goal in stoppage time to seal the win, putting Dortmund through 3-1 on aggregate, making the last eight for the first time since 2021. “It was like a relief. I think like all players you want to have a good start to the game – and there’s no better feeling than that,” Sancho told TNT Sports. “I’m just grateful that I could get a goal for the team. We knew it was going to be tough, but I felt we’d have the advantage because we’re playing in front of our home fans.” Sancho, 23, had an unhappy time at Manchester United and had been forced to train away from the first team having fallen out of favour with coach Erik ten Hag. Having only made three appearances in the Premier League this season, the winger arrived in Dortmund for his second spell at the club in January on a six-month loan. He came into Wednesday’s game saying he could “understand fans getting frustrated” with his output, but has now scored twice in two games. “I’ve always got a special place for Borussia Dortmund,” Sancho said. “This is where I made my name. I have to be grateful to them and to my teammates for believing in me. “I’m just happy we got the win today.” Dortmund coach Edin Terzic, who coached Sancho during the Englishman’s first stint in Germany, praised the winger. “I’m happy for Jadon that he scored. He had a really great game,” Terzic told reporters. “I think that today Jadon showed us his best performance since he returned to us.” Terzic said Dortmund and Sancho were being rewarded for their patience. “It was only seven days ago when everyone was asking ‘What’s happening with Jadon, why hasn’t he scored? Now he has two goals.” Sancho was substituted with 15 minutes remaining while clutching his thigh, but said: “I felt something and I just didn’t want to risk it. “We’re gonna check and hopefully it’s nothing.” Terzic added, “He felt something in his leg, but we hope that he comes through it healthy and that he’ll be available for us this weekend.”",

    "title": "Amazon presentó un chip de computación cuántica para competir con Microsoft y Google",
    "text": "Amazon presentó este jueves su primer chip de computación cuántica, sumándose a la creciente lista de gigantes tecnológicos que ingresan al sector de los chips de este tipo. Llamado Ocelot, el chip, según Amazon, ayuda a resolver un “problema clave” en los sistemas de computación cuántica, lo que podría acelerar el desarrollo de computadoras cuánticas prácticas.\nSegún informó Yahoo Finance, el anuncio de Amazon llega apenas una semana después de que Microsoft revelara su propio chip cuántico, Majorana 1. Google, por su parte, presentó su chip cuántico Willow en diciembre. Para el medio, liderar la computación cuántica representaría una “enorme oportunidad” para los gigantes de la nube, y “asegura” una ventaja competitiva en un campo con el potencial de transformar múltiples industrias y generar ingresos durante años.\nAmazon asegura que su chip facilita la corrección de errores bosónicos, un paso crucial para lograr que los sistemas cuánticos realicen cálculos que tomarían años a las computadoras clásicas.\nA diferencia de la computación clásica, que utiliza bits representados por 1 y 0, la computación cuántica emplea cúbits, que pueden representar simultáneamente un 1 y un 0. Esto permite a las computadoras cuánticas procesar enormes cantidades de información a velocidades mucho mayores que las computadoras tradicionales. En algunos casos, podrían resolver problemas en minutos que tomarían cientos o miles de años en una computadora convencional.\nSin embargo, los cúbits son extremadamente frágiles y pueden ser propensos a errores debido a interferencias externas. El chip de Amazon busca abordar estos errores de manera eficiente.\n“Creemos que la arquitectura de Ocelot, con su enfoque de corrección de errores eficiente en hardware, nos posiciona bien para la siguiente fase de la computación cuántica: aprender a escalar”, afirmaron en un comunicado Fernando Brandão, jefe de aplicaciones de software cuántico de Amazon, y Oskar Painter, jefe de hardware cuántico.\n“Escalar de manera frugal mediante eficiencia en hardware nos permitirá lograr más rápidamente y a menor costo una computadora cuántica con corrección de errores que beneficie a la sociedad”, agregaron.\nEl anuncio de Amazon es el más reciente en una serie de desarrollos en la carrera de las grandes tecnológicas por construir una computadora cuántica funcional capaz de realizar cálculos en campos como la salud y la ciencia de materiales.\nLa semana pasada, Microsoft presentó su chip Majorana 1, que, según la compañía, utiliza un nuevo material llamado topoconductor. Microsoft asegura que este material aprovecha un nuevo estado de la materia, distinto de los sólidos, líquidos y gases, al adoptar una configuración topológica, aunque algunos expertos han mostrado escepticismo sobre esta afirmación.\nEl chip Willow de Google también busca corregir errores en sistemas cuánticos y, según la compañía, impulsará el desarrollo de computadoras cuánticas escalables en el futuro.\nEl avance de la computación cuántica sigue generando debate sobre cuándo será realmente útil para resolver problemas científicos complejos, como el descubrimiento de nuevos medicamentos o la mejora en modelos financieros.\nEl CEO de Nvidia, Jensen Huang, estima que las computadoras cuánticas prácticas aún están a 20 años de convertirse en una realidad, mientras que el CEO de Google, Sundar Pichai, cree que podrían estar listas en un período de entre cinco y diez años.",

    "title": "Bobby De Cordova-Reid stunner sees Fulham beat Rotherham in FA Cup | News and Star",
    "text": "A Bobby De Cordova-Reid stunner saw Fulham beat Rotherham 1-0 in the third round of the FA Cup at Craven Cottage. The Jamaica international capitalised on a mistake and scored his second in as many games after Sunday’s winner during Fulham’s 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League. Victory for Marco Silva’s men has kept them in both cup competitions ahead of Fulham’s Carabao Cup semi-final clash against Liverpool later this month. A cagey first few minutes in west London saw Andreas Pereira showcase his quick feet before his driven shot cannoned off a defender. Fulham appealed for a handball but referee Simon Hooper waved them away and a corner was given. Rotherham had little to show for their efforts, and their low defensive line invited pressure in the 20th minute. Fulham’s De Cordova-Reid threatened with a cross and the Cottagers’ Championship opponents were fortunate to not go a goal down from the following corner when Rodrigo Muniz’s effort was blocked. De Cordova-Reid opened the scoring in spectacular fashion after 24 minutes. Rotherham’s attempt to play the ball out from the back ran into trouble when Harry Wilson’s press forced a turnover and De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort flew past Viktor Johansson into the top left corner. A lethargic Rotherham rarely ventured into Fulham’s territory but Jordan Hugill’s offside goal from a Tom Eaves cross added to their frustrations. Fulham nearly doubled their lead in the 42nd minute but Pereira was denied by a post. Right-back Kenny Tete marauded forward and delivered a dangerous cross to the unmarked Pereira, who struck the ball into the ground before it cannoned off a post and into the path of Harrison Reed, whose close-range shot was deflected behind for a corner. Fulham continued to be lively after the break. The dangerous Tete surged forward and his drilled cross caused Rotherham keeper Johansson to fumble the ball. The Swedish international’s blushes were saved when he made a stop from six yards out. The hosts slowed the game down and dominated the ball but the game burst into life through Issa Diop after 76 minutes. The centre-back picked up the ball and cut through Rotherham’s midfield before a neat combination with Timothy Castagne saw the towering defender’s first-time strike narrowly miss the target. Fulham countered from a corner during five added minutes but Carlos Vinicius’ shot was saved after Willian squared it to him.

    "text": "BRUSSELS, June 27. /TASS/. Ukraine does not want to prolong the conflict due to the high count of killed and injured at the battlefield, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said upon arrival to the EU Summit.\n\"We must put this [settlement] plan on the table within few months. We do not have much time, because we have a lot of killed and injured on the battlefield. […] Therefore we do not want this war to last for years. Therefore we want to prepare this peace plan for the second summit,\" Zelensky said.\nPreviously, Ukraine announced that it will prepare a settlement plan after the first conference in Switzerland, which will be presented to Russia at the second similar meeting.\nMeanwhile, Zelensky added that Ukraine had no contacts with Russia after the conference in Switzerland, where a number of countries stated the settlement must be discussed with Moscow.\n\"I had no dialogue with them during all this time. […] If it happens in shadow, in secret, this is not about us. We want to do that openly,\" he noted.\nSNIP",

    "text": "D-Link continúa con el desastre: tras sus NAS ahora sus routers antiguos son vulnerables y la compañía se niega a parchearlos\nSegún va pasando el tiempo, lo que habíamos comprado y en su día\nera una novedad, ahora puede que sea algo totalmente desfasado. La\ntecnología no para de avanzar con el paso de los años y gracias a\nesto vemos progresos con el tiempo. Ahora bien, si eres de los que\nno quiere actualizar o cambiar lo que tiene, puede que llegue un\npunto donde te quedes con algo que no funciona o es totalmente\nvulnerable. Así ha pasado con los routers antiguos de D-Link que\nhan acabado siendo abandonados por completo por la compañía, dado\nque ahora [sufren una vulnerabilidad y se\nniegan a lanzar parches](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/d-link-refuses-to-patch-yet-another-security-flaw-suggests-users-just-buy-new-routers-d-link-told-users-to-replace-nas-last-week).\nSi queremos comprar algo y acudimos a tiendas como Amazon debido a su disponibilidad y precios, verás que hay tantísimas marcas y productos que acabarás comprando lo más popular o vendido posiblemente. Esto no es algo precisamente malo, dado que si hay algo que han comprado muchas personas y tiene buenas valoraciones, es más fiable que otras marcas desconocidas.\nLos routers antiguos de D-Link son susceptibles a una vulnerabilidad y carecen de soporte\nSi eres de los que está buscando como mejorar la conectividad de\nla red en casa, hay switches, routers o incluso\nWi-Fi en formato USB para PC de una marca que la\nmayoría conocemos, D-Link. Esta suele ser la top\nventas y con buenos precios en todo tipo de tiendas de electrónica\ny por norma general hace buenos productos. El problema es que\núltimamente han aparecido clientes enfurecidos con la actitud de la\ncompañía. Esto no es de extrañar por el hecho de que sus\ndispositivos antiguos son vulnerables y esta no va a dar ninguna\nsolución a los consumidores que siguen usándolos, [salvo que consideres que comprar\nalgo nuevo es una solución](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2024/11/d-link-solucion-vulnerabilidad-nas/).\nEsto ya pasó con sus NAS antiguos y ahora vemos que ocurre lo mismo con varios modelos de routers que han sido descatalogados. En este caso se trata de los modelos DSR-150, DSR-150N, DSR-250 y DSR-250N que dejaron de recibir soporte en 2024 junto a los DSR-500N y DSR-1000N que se descatalogaron en 2015. Estos modelos de routers son susceptibles a ataques RCE (ejecución remota de código), por lo que sufren de una vulnerabilidad que debería ser parcheada. Sin embargo, la respuesta de D-Link es la misma que cuando ocurrió lo de los NAS, no habrá parches y se recomienda desecharlos y comprar nuevos routers.\nLo único que ofrecen es un descuento del 20% para clientes afectados de EE.UU.\nLa compañía taiwanesa asegura que una vez un producto alcanza el estado EOL (End of Life) ya no recibirá soporte y esto no va a cambiar. Lo único que ofrece la compañía es un descuento del 20% destinado a los afectados que tengan alguno de estos modelos de router. Ahora bien, los descuentos solo sirven para clientes de EE.UU., por lo que si vives en Europa no podrás usar el descuento.\nSi bien esta no es la solución que muchos esperaban, tocará acostumbrarse a que una compañía tan conocida como esta deje de lado sus productos y no haya más soporte. Hay que decir que si vemos la fecha de lanzamiento de algunos de estos routers estamos hablando de 2012 y modelos más antiguos, por lo que han pasado más de 10 años desde entonces.",

    "text": "In 2021 and 2022, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won consecutive division titles for the first time in franchise history. Now they've made it three in a row. With a 9-0 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Week 18, the Buccaneers clinched the NFC South and locked themselves into the fourth seed in the conference playoff field. The win in Charlotte improved the Bucs' record to 9-8 and eliminated both the Saints and the Falcons from division title contention. This marks the ninth time Tampa Bay has finished first in its division and the sixth time since the NFC South was formed in 2002. In addition to the last three seasons, the Buccaneers also won the NFC Central in 1979, 1981 and 1999 and the NFC South in 2002, 2005 and 2007. The Buccaneers have now qualified for the postseason in four consecutive seasons, with their Wild Card berth in 2020 leading to a thrilling run to Super Bowl LV, in which they became the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl in its home stadium. This is just the second time in team history the Bucs have recorded four straight playoff seasons, equaling their run from 1999-2002, which culminated in victory in Super Bowl XXXVII. As of the conclusion of the 1:00 p.m. games, the Buccaneers are one of only two teams that have made it to the postseason in each of the last four years, joining the Kansas City Chiefs. The Buffalo Bills could make it a group of three if they clinch a spot later in the day. Overall, this is the 14th season that has ended in a playoff berth for the Buccaneers. In addition to their nine division titles they were also Wild Card entrants in 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2020. After a players' strike reduced the 1982 regular season to nine games, the NFL conducted a \"Super Bowl tournament\" that included eight teams from each conference, and the Buccaneers got in as the NFC's seventh seed. All four division winners in the conference are guaranteed at least one home playoff game. The first seed gets a bye in the Wild Card round and the other three division winners host the three Wild Card participants. As the lowest-seeded division winner, the Buccaneers get the highest-seeded Wild Card team, the Eagles.",

FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY Today will stay hot, but not as hot as the last couple of days. High temperatures will still stretch in the lower to mid 90s this afternoon, but some spots may end up staying in the 80s today. We’ll also need to watch for a couple of hit and miss storms as well. There is a low-end risk for a strong to an isolated severe storm this afternoon and evening, mainly east of I-65. Heavy rain and damaging winds are the main threats once again. Any storms would fall apart tonight as we cool things down. The lows tomorrow morning will be in the low 70s, but some of us could drop into the 60s.

THIS WEEKEND Heat and humidity will also back off slightly this weekend with highs in the low to mid 90s Saturday and Sunday. Heat index values will be near the triple digits but shouldn’t be as harsh as earlier this week. A stray shower or storm also cannot be ruled out on Saturday, but most of us stay dry. Sunday will be dry and mostly sunny. FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAYS Four more First Alert Weather Days have been added for next week with high temperatures expected to get back into the mid and upper 90s Monday through Thursday.
