    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death.\nFour models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S.\nHealth Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country.\nThe metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

(WECT) - “This festival would not have lasted for 77 years without that true, deep connection, and that’s been a joy to witness.” Those were the words from 77th Azalea Queen Sharon Lawrence as she and her court made a visit to Novant Health’s Betty H. Cameron Women’s & Children’s Hospital on Thursday. As part of several visits around the Cape Fear Region, they met with hospital staff and patients to bring a smile to their faces and show them the importance of the healthcare in the Wilmington community. “I had the honor to play a pediatric nurse in a Hallmark film called Hearts of Christmas. I’m going to say the name because I’m really proud that Hallmark took on a tough subject. But with grace, and the understanding that at that fragile time of life, it’s again about the human touch. And none of us know when we’ll need the services that a Woman and Children’s hospital will provide,” Lawrence said. The Queen and her court also played games and visited with children and their parents. “To be here today really confirms to me what I’ve already known,” the 77th Azalea Queen said. “It was a really moving visit, because, you see the success, you see the fragility, but you know the resilience that’s behind it all.” Copyright 2024 WECT.

    "text": "Con cada temporada del año, las marcas de ropa ofrecen una gran variabilidad de nuevas tendencias y estilos. En [Lolitas&L](https://lolitasyl.com/), reflejan en cada una de sus prendas esos cambios de estilo, así como la dedicación por mantenerse a la vanguardia de la [sostenibilidad en la moda](https://lolitasyl.com/pages/quienes-somos). Con cada colección, la marca no solamente se encarga de crear modelos a la moda, sino que también incluyen prendas originales, estableciendo nuevas tendencias. Lolitas&L y la sostenibilidad de sus colecciones Cuando se habla de sostenibilidad en moda, se refiere a un conjunto de prácticas en el diseño, creación y consumo de moda que no solo respetan el medio ambiente, sino también a la plantilla que trabaja en la industria. A partir de esta premisa, se tienen en consideración aspectos como la reducción de los niveles de contaminación, la sobreproducción o el apoyo a la biodiversidad. Por otro lado, también se pueden contemplar mejores condiciones de trabajo, entre otros beneficios. En datos, la producción textil representa un 20 % de la contaminación mundial de agua potable. Solo en Europa, las personas consumen ya un 40 % más de prendas en comparación con 1996.

Tal como la firma explica, crean moda atemporal y duradera a través de excelentes materiales y procesos de fabricación especialmente respetuosos con el medio ambiente.

A través de cada una de sus propuestas, intentan reflejar la posibilidad de combinar no únicamente looks innovadores, sino también ambientalmente conscientes. Diseños exclusivos y una distribución estratégica Para las prendas de las colecciones, Lolitas&L incide en la necesidad de que sean exclusivas, a la par que sostenibles. Desde la creación hasta la artesanía que da vida a cada uno de sus modelos, cada miembro de la empresa juega un papel esencial. Es justamente gracias a su equipo, por lo que cada colección de la marca ofrece prendas originales y frescas. En estas características clave también influye el equilibrio entre esa exclusividad y la accesibilidad a la marca, puesto que además de tener tienda física en el barrio, la marca se ha expandido a comercios multimarca y tienen presencia digital a través de su página web. Al ofrecer tantas facilidades, garantizan que sus colecciones estén disponibles para una gran cantidad de clientela, extendiendo su alcance cada vez más expandido.

    "text": "- Marina Hegering - 24'\n- Lea Schüller - 64'\n- Jule Brand - 68'\nMatildas humbled in Olympics opener by Germany\nLawson: Matildas look like they don't know how to play without Sam Kerr\nSophie Lawson says things are looking ominous for the Matildas after their 3-0 loss in the group stage at the Olympic Games.\nThe Matildas have suffered a chastening start to their latest Olympic dream, outclassed 3-0 by Games powerhouse Germany on a stifling, dispiriting night in the south of France.\nThe World Cup semi-finalists, seeking their first ever Olympic medal, were simply not allowed to find their stride against the accomplished former champions in Marseille on Thursday on the eve of the Games start in Paris 750km away.\nGermany, inspired by their brilliant winger Jule Brand, could have won by an even bigger margin and the bruising setback in group B leaves Tony Gustavsson's side immediately on the back foot in a tough group also featuring a powerful US side.\nIt means they must win their next match against Zambia in Nice on Sunday - and they will need to improve drastically.\nThe Matildas barely created a worthwhile chance, any decent approach work being scuppered by poor build-up delivery, and the Germans were decisive winners with two headed goals for Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller from corners, before Brand fittingly wrapped up the most comprehensive of victories.\nThe Australians, who'd suffered a blow beforehand with injury forcing Tameka Yallop out of the squad, were quickly alerted to the danger of the excellent Brand, who got her shot away in the fourth minute after Kyra Cooney-Cross was robbed in midfield.\nSoon after, a terrific quick ball delivered by German goalie Ann-Katrin Berger again found Brand, who cut inside Katrina Gorry and should have scored, only to fire high and not very handsome.\nThe Matildas contributed to a lively opening quarter but their high line left them vulnerable on the counter, with Cortnee Vine needing to make a key interception to stop Giulia Gwinn volleying the Germans ahead.\nThere felt an inevitability, though, about the 24th minute opener as Gwinn's pinpoint corner to the back post was met by a superbly timed downward header by Hegering, who had bullied her way through Ellie Carpenter.\nMary Fowler, who had an ineffective night up front, nearly responded immediately afterwards, but was dispossessed when she turned to fire in the box, and the Tillies did have a couple of speculative efforts through Caitlin Foord.\nYet the Germans could have gone further ahead before the break only for Sjoeke Nusken to be stopped by a fine intervention from captain Steph Catley, who had won her battle for fitness.\nRiding their luck, Australia's defence was again broken down at the start of the second half when Clare Hunt got caught in possession by Brand. She freed Alex Popp, whose shot was brilliantly blocked by Alanna Kennedy.\nThe Australians were undone again from a Gwinn corner in the 64th minute, when Schueller was left unmarked to head home from six metres out.\nBrand was then rewarded for her brilliance by tapping home four minutes later after a fine team move, starting from goalie Berger, shredded the green-and-gold defence.\nThe Germans had a fourth scrambled goal disallowed soon after for offside and threatened to inflict even more damage with the Tillies, who pushed in vain for a consolation after bringing on Michelle Heyman, surviving an even worse fate.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Katia Itzel García\nWomen's Olympic Tournament Standings\nOLY Football (W) News\n[The U.S. women opened the 2024 Olympics looking more dangerous than they did in their poor World Cup last year.

    "text": "TOLEDO, 2 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl arzobispo de Toledo, Francisco Cerro Chaves, ha elogiado este domingo la labor de Cáritas, durante la celebración de la 'Santa Misa de la Solemnidad del Corpus Christi' en la Catedral Primada de Toledo, afirmando que \"es inseparable la Eucaristía y el amor a los pobres\".\nLas palabras del arzobispo coinciden con la celebración del 60 aniversario de la constitución canónica de Cáritas Diocesana de Toledo, según ha informado la propia Cáritas mediante nota de prensa. Una efeméride que los equipos de voluntariado de las Cáritas Parroquiales de la Archidiócesis de Toledo han celebrado saliendo a lo largo de todo el fin de semana a las calles.\nDurante la misa de la Solemnidad del Corpus Christi, en la que ha participado el equipo directivo de Cáritas, junto a residentes del Centro de Personas sin Hogar 'Cardenal González Martín', Francisco Cerro Chaves ha recordado que la próxima semana se celebrará en Camuñas, Oropesa, Toledo y Torrijos el Congreso Eucarístico, ha manifestado que \"no podemos vivir sin la Eucaristía, celebrada, comulgada y adorada\", enfatizando que \"donde hay pobres tiene que estar la Iglesia y tiene que estar Cáritas\".\nEl arzobispo de Toledo, ha animado nuevamente a que las parroquias constituyan una Cáritas Parroquial, que organice la caridad, afirmando que es \"inseparable la Eucaristía y el amor a los pobres, como han hecho los grandes santos y como hace Cáritas\".\nEl arzobispo de Toledo ha señalado que se tiene \"que hacer visible la presencia de la Iglesia con los más necesitados, con los más pobres\".\nCáritas Diocesana de Toledo ha recordado el mensaje de la Subcomisión Episcopal para la Acción Caritativa y Social en el Día de la Caridad, que indica que \"un año más, la celebración del día de la Caridad, nos compromete a transitar caminos de fraternidad, a animar y promover el compromiso de la comunidad cristiana y de la sociedad en general, con la defensa de la dignidad de las personas y sus derechos\".\nLeer más acerca de: Chaves Cáritas Pobreza",
