    "title": "The Marsh to Present Brian Copeland's GREAT AMERICAN SH*T SHOW",
    "text": "The Great American Sh*t Show will be presented 7:00pm, Thursdays, September 26, and October 3 at The Marsh Berkeley and October 10 and 24 at The Marsh San Francisco. The Marsh will present the return of Brian Copeland’s The Great American Sh*t Show. Originally created by Brian Copeland in collaboration with [Charlie Varon](/people/Charlie-Varon/) as a duet, the show is now performed solo by Copeland. This collection of monologues on life in the Age of Trump explores a range of topics, including navigating family dynamics with a Trump supporter, the idea of when America was last “great,” #MeToo, and more. The Great American Sh*t Show will be presented 7:00pm, Thursdays, September 26, and October 3 at The Marsh Berkeley and October 10 and 24 at The Marsh San Francisco. The Great American Sh*t Show originated with Brian Copeland performing a 15-minute monologue at The Marsh San Francisco, describing the day after the 2016 presidential election. While Copeland was driving on the Bay Bridge, a bearded white man driving a Prius pulled up next to Copeland and yelled, “N****r!” “I haven’t been called that word in years,” Copeland noted. “Years actually. But on that day, the day after [Donald Trump](/people/Donald-Trump/) is elected president, it’s almost like the Prius driver was granted permission.” Collaborator [Charlie Varon](/people/Charlie-Varon/) said, “Brian’s monologue was equal parts truth, pain, and comedy. I left the theater disturbed and invigorated. A few days later, I called Brian and suggested we do a show together. He said yes, and we got busy writing.” As a duet, Copeland and Varon performed The Great American Sh*t Show to sold-out audiences at The Marsh, with the material evolving in response to unfolding political events. The audience reaction was electrifying, with one member describing the show as “much-needed catharsis. Finally, someone saying all the things we have been feeling during the sh*t show.” The San Francisco Chronicle praised the show as “smart, funny, provocative, and at times, unexpectedly deeply moving,” while Marinscope Newspapers lauded Copeland and Varon as “incredible storytellers.” Videos",

    "title": "Froma Harrop: Jamaal Bowman's defeat shows the Squad lacks serious quality control",
    "text": "Jamaal Bowman's loss was the Democrats' gain. A member of the left-fringe Squad, his primary defeat removes at least one irritant to the Democrats' quest to take control of the House. And if his replacement with a moderate marks the beginning of the end for the Squad, well, bravo for the victor, Westchester County executive George Latimer.\nNew York's 16th Congressional District includes some New York suburbs plus a slice of the Bronx. Squad founder Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the old Socialist Bernie Sanders thought it would be a good idea to hold a rally for Bowman in the South Bronx.\nNever mind that the South Bronx wasn't part of Bowman's district. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres represents that area. Perhaps Bowman figured his working-class audience would relate to his obscenity-filled rants. Torres thought otherwise.\n\"There is nothing in Jamaal Bowman's unhinged tirade,\" Torres posted on X, \"that remotely resembles the decency of the people I know and represent in the South Bronx.\"\nPeople are also reading…\nBowman insisted that as a Black man, he has an \"ethnic benefit.\" Well, Torres is half-Black, half-Latino, and former New York Rep. Mondaire Jones is Black. Both Torres and Jones endorsed Latimer, a 70-year-old white guy who happens to have experience in governing.\nBowman seems to have forgotten that a congressman is supposed to do a thing called constituent service, that is, providing help to the people in the district. The people rarely saw him.\n\"He doesn't really study government,\" Latimer said at a recent event for seniors. \"He doesn't really understand it. He's out there on a soap box, talking what he feels.\"\nAIPAC, the pro-Israel lobbying group, spent a lot of money trying to get Bowman defeated. Headlines say they're the reason he lost. But it took more than AIPAC to produce an incumbent's 17-point loss.\nNo doubt their barrage of ads played a part, but Bowman's views on Israel were worse than incendiary – they were ignorant. It's one thing to criticize Israel's conduct in the Gaza war. It's another to question the claim that Hamas committed sexual violence in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, as Bowman did.\nBowman clearly has some screws loose. He gave voice to a looney conspiracy theory related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on New York City. The Daily Beast unearthed Bowman's blog post passing on the paranoid belief that the collapse of Building 7, a skyscraper in the World Trade Center complex, was a controlled demolition.\nAs a congressman, he famously set off a fire alarm in a House office building, juvenile-delinquent style. This was done, it is believed, to delay a scheduled vote on a government funding bill. Of course, the building had to be evacuated.\nBowman first lied about setting off the alarm. Then when security cameras caught him in the act, he lied about not knowing what it was. You'd think that a former middle school principal would know what a fire alarm looked like.\nBowman had joined AOC in voting against Joe Biden's infrastructure bill – a tantrum over one of their priorities being left out. To this day, unions have not forgiven either of them for that.\nPerhaps the biggest problem for Bowman is that his challenger is a man of substance. As a county executive, Latimer makes budgets, manages essential services – including public safety – and sees that the laws are enforced.\nAOC, Bernie and Bowman apparently chose the South Bronx for its symbolic value. And it all fits. Their posturing was for the cameras, not the 16th district's constituents who happened to live elsewhere.\nThe Squad suffers a serious lack of quality control, and Bowman isn't its only flawed product. May moderate Democrats continue to replace them.",

    "text": "The Montreal Canadiens keep getting written off by pundits this season, but inside the locker room, the players have faith they are in the mix for a playoff spot. Veteran winger Brendan Gallagher believes that the club has a real chance to play meaningful games in March.\nMontreal was only three points out of a playoff spot heading into Thursday night’s action as they continued their seven-game road trip in Raleigh, N.C. The Hurricanes are a strong club getting terrible goaltending, so they’ve been a major disappointment this year. However, they shaded the Canadiens 5-3.\nWilde Horses It’s so difficult to know the ceiling of a player, and occasionally when it keeps going higher, it can be surprising. Jesse Ylonen seemed to be one of those players who had a shot at making the National Hockey League, but if he gave the American Hockey League a try and it ended only in a return to Europe, not many would have been that surprised. He didn’t have better than a 14-goal season in Laval.\nStory continues below advertisement Ylonen didn’t immediately have NHL player written all over him. After a couple of seasons in the minors, he got his chance to play in the show. Initially, again, it didn’t seem like it was a given that he would stick around, or even get a regular shift.\nNow, in year four of his North American experience, Ylonen is showing that he has not been given enough of an opportunity to shine. He gets fourth-line minutes, and perhaps he deserves some time higher up the lineup, so everyone can see exactly what he can do beside better players.\nMore on Sports Blue Jays re-sign Kiermaier to one-year deal An east coast song celebrates Team Canada goals at world juniors for second year Celebrini’s 5-point performance leads Canada over Latvia at world juniors Reports: Isiah Kiner-Falefa signs with Blue Jays Ylonen, in the first period, showed his outstanding skill set to help the Canadiens get on the board. He beat out the icing with tremendous speed, then passed the puck off the boards on the way to the point to avoid the Carolina defender. A small bit of billiards, but an intelligent and creative bit. His work led to Mitchell Stephens’ goal.\nYlonen has a tremendous shot when he gets a good look. He has one of the best shots on the team. It is not an accident that Ylonen is the second-best player on the club in the shootout behind only Nick Suzuki. He has shown both an outstanding shot roofing attempts, and a terrific deke leaving the goaltender on the wrong side of the net.\nThis second-rounder is getting better by the week. Keep playing him. Keep giving him opportunity to see where the ceiling finally stops expanding. He might be a valuable piece as a complete hockey player that even the best teams can use on their roster.\nStory continues below advertisement Josh Anderson has gone from 25 games without a goal to the hottest scorer on the team. Third period, with the Canadiens trailing 3-2, Anderson got a clear breakaway that he scored five-hole on a deke. Anderson has five goals in his last five games. He has six goals now on the season, and trails Cole Caufield by only two goals. No one saw that coming when he was the butt of poor jokes.\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. Juraj Slafkovsky may have quite a lot more in his arsenal than he has been showing. Slafkovsky made a power move to the inside during the third period that was nothing like we have seen since he walked through Kazakhstan at the Olympics. Slafkovsky split the defence, and got off an excellent shot from inside 10 feet.\nIf Slafkovsky can repeat this move in any capacity, he is going to terrify defenders who won’t be able to handle him physically. It could be an outstanding development. All he has to do is repeat this, or even just believe he can do it, then try it again.\nThis was an exciting moment for the organization, no doubt.\nWilde Goats It was another competitive game for the Canadiens where they stayed in the fight right until the end against an excellent team. The string of five straight games with a point earned ends, but they were tied with less than seven minutes remaining.\nStory continues below advertisement Kaiden Guhle had a bit of a rough game, and some forwards had quiet nights like Caufield and Nick Suzuki, but nothing worth getting too critical over considering their overall run of play in the last two weeks. On to Sunrise, Fla., for a tough one against the hot Panthers on Saturday night.\n4:43 Call of the Wilde on Global News Morning Wilde Cards One of the great debates in hockey circles is what it takes to become a Stanley Cup Champion. It’s an emotional topic in Montreal. A narrative continues to gain energy that it doesn’t take star players.\nTrending Now Cher files for conservatorship of son Elijah, claims his life is ‘at risk’ Last Canadian missing after Hamas attack confirmed dead, family says Lacking a Wayne Gretzky, Patrick Kane, Mario Lemieux, or Sidney Crosby in Montreal, naturally, it is popular to suggest these types aren’t even needed to win a title.\nWhile there are always outliers in sports, the overwhelming majority of champions are clubs with the most talent. For every 1978 Washington Bullets in the NBA, there are 20 Michael Jordan’s Bulls or Magic Johnson’s Lakers. Basketball requires the most star power; hockey the least.\nStory continues below advertisement Hockey is the most chaotic of all the major sports. It has the most luck of the bounce. It has the fewest designed plays. It doesn’t even face-off knowing who will win possession. Even that is open to chance; never mind the path of the puck, as a point shot journeys through eight bodies to the goal. It could bounce anywhere.\nHockey also has massive influence from a hot goalie, and no one can possibly say from playoff to playoff who will be that hot netminder. That is voodoo. However, even with all of this, superstars weigh heavily on hockey outcomes.\nThere are championship NHL teams that didn’t fit the star dynamic. St. Louis rode Jordan Binnington to a title. Even Las Vegas rode a team concept to a title last season. However, it is historically provable that star power wins. The Lightning, Hawks, Penguins, Capitals are the overwhelming majority of winners recently.\nTake a longer view, through the years, to find more stars shining in Edmonton, Detroit, Long Island and Montreal. Every dynasty was full of the world’s best hockey players.\nCanadiens management shouldn’t be let off the hook by hopeful fans and sportswriters who sell you the narrative that Montreal’s rebuild is close to done and a title could be on the horizon. They are not close. The present-day Canadiens need a scoring star just like the 90 per cent of Cup champions have had.\nStory continues below advertisement This rebuild will go right back to the middle without a game breaker. It will be exactly like every rebuild before this one. This rebuild lacks the same stars. It will have the same results. You aren’t guaranteed to win with stars, but you’re almost certainly guaranteed to not win without stars.\nDon’t hope for a once-in-a-decade outlier title. Hope for a star to arrive. If you’re going to hope, at least do it logically. Let over 100 years of history be your guide. Guy Lafleur and Rocket Richard have a far more convincing story to tell than the hundreds of 65-point guys who donned the CH who didn’t make it to Sainte Catherine Street for a parade.\nBrian Wilde, a Montreal-based sports writer, brings you Call of the Wilde on globalnews.ca after each Canadiens game.\n4:33 Call of the Wilde!",

En el marco del Día Mundial de los Animales, la empresa destaca su compromiso de aplicar las mejores las prácticas disponibles, con apego a su Política de Sostenibilidad y sus lineamientos de ética e integridad, para proteger los ecosistemas. “La empresa mantiene programas de protección y reubicación de especies de fauna y flora en los sitios donde tiene unidades operativas, cuyos detalles se brindan a las autoridades correspondientes”, señala Rafael Rebollar, director general de Industrias Peñoles. Es durante toda la cadena de valor y a lo largo del ciclo de vida de las operaciones que se toman medidas como la identificación de especies y su reubicación en zonas donde pueden continuar su desarrollo sin riesgos. El programa de protección en resguardo considera individuos que, por haber nacido o pasado mucho tiempo en cautiverio, podrían tener grandes dificultades de adaptación al hábitat natural. Es importante señalar que para cuidar de estos animales se tienen los permisos correspondientes establecidos por la autoridad. Para ello, la empresa cuenta con un área de reserva localizada en el municipio de Cuencamé, Durango, donde cuida de más de 110 ejemplares de fauna de 12 especies. Se trata de un predio de aproximadamente 50 hectáreas, donde habitan especies tales como bisonte americano, búfalo acuático, watusi, avestruz, ciervo wapiti, venado fallow, mapache, pavorreal, borrego muflón, osos y un mono araña. Certificada como Predio e Instalación que Maneja Vida Silvestre fuera de su Hábitat Natural (PIMVS) ante la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, la Reserva Ecológica Peñoles se estableció desde 2014 y es una muestra del inquebrantable compromiso de la empresa con la protección de la biodiversidad y el medio ambiente, remarcando su liderazgo en la minería sustentable. El Día Mundial de los Animales se celebra el 4 de octubre desde 1925, con el propósito de prevenir la crueldad hacia los animales, preservar los hábitats y salvar especies en peligro de extinción. Coincide con la festividad de San Francisco de Asís, santo patrón de los animales.",

    "text": "\"Sono davvero rattristato di aver saputo della morte di Marianne Faithfull . È stata parte della mia vita per tanto tempo\" scrive su Instagram Mick Jagger , frontman dei Rolling Stones commentando la scomparsa della cantante e attrice britannica. \"È stata un'amica meravigliosa - aggiunge la rockstar nel post accompagnato da una foto in bianco nero che li vede insieme negli anni Sessanta - una bellissima cantante e una grande attrice. Sarà sempre ricordata\".\nAnche il chitarrista degli Stones , Keith Richards , ha condiviso sui social la sua tristezza per la scomparsa di Marianne Faithfull : \"Mi mancherà\", ha scritto.\nAnche Ron Wood ha reso omaggio alla cantante condividendo due foto con Faithfull: una più datata, scattata in uno studio di registrazione, con la didascalia \"Addio cara Marianne\", e una più recente, commentando \"Marianne ci mancherà moltissimo\".\nLa relazione tra Faithfull e Jagger è stata molto tormentata, a tratti drammatica. Iniziata nel 1964, la storia tra i due artisti conobbe il punto più tragico nel 1968: Faithfull rimase incinta ma perse il bambino al settimo mese . La relazione divenne ancora più turbolenta: in occasione di un viaggio in Australia con Jagger, Marianne tentò il suicidio ingerendo una gran quantità di pillole. Si svegliò dal coma dopo sei giorni: “Non sono morta per un pelo. E avevo 22 anni”, dichiarò anni dopo.\nNegli anni, il rapporto tra Faithfull e Jagger migliorò molto fino a trasformarsi in una grande amicizia: la cantate andò anche al funerale di Bianca Jagger , storica ex moglie di Mick, nel 1999.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",
