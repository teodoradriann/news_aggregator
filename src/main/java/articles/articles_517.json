    "title": "DigiYatra Campaign: When data privacy concerns halt growth, Marketing & Advertising News, ET BrandEquity",
    "text": "[Marketing](/news/marketing)- 4 min read When data privacy concerns halt growth Data privacy and protection have become standard concerns in an increasingly digitalized world. Brands are increasingly communicating their data privacy and protection features to consumers to build trust. DigiYatra’s recent campaign, ‘Don’t Know Your Customer,’ highlights why such initiatives must communicate simply and effectively to influence people’s behaviour. There’s no doubt that Indian consumers value data privacy and protection. A PwC Voice of the Consumer Survey 2024 highlighted that 82% of Indian consumers consider the protection of personal data as the most crucial factor in building trust. This can lead to consumer behaviours such as enabling location-based services on a device, discontinuing the use of an app, or deleting a social media account. Few consumers trust companies to protect their personal data and are increasingly taking matters into their own hands to safeguard their privacy. Brands are realising that being data compliant and adhering to prevailing laws is not enough—they must also clearly communicate their efforts to protect users' data and security. Case in point: the massive campaigns by WhatsApp,[Google](/tag/google), and Truecaller to communicate their privacy features to users. Launched in 2022, DigiYatra has been rolled out across 24 airports in the country, with plans to expand to 4-5 more airports in the coming months. The app has 6.3 million users, who have collectively used it over 33 million times across Indian airports. This remarkable growth has been driven solely by on-ground marketing at partner airports and through social media. DigiYatra uses facial recognition technology to verify a passenger’s identity, reducing airport entry time from an average of 15-20 seconds to 3-5 seconds. Multiplied by lakhs of daily airline passengers (4.84 lakh on a single record day), this results in significant time savings and operational efficiencies at airports. DigiYatra aims to further reduce these times by implementing an open gate entry system. Despite its success, DigiYatra has faced concerns from users via emails and social media, suggesting that it stores personal data and may use it for surveillance. He elaborated, “In today’s world, everyone wants to know their customer to provide hyper-personalised services. We take a different approach by saying, ‘We don’t want to know you,’ thereby mitigating the risk of data loss, theft, leakage, or misuse. DigiYatra uses a self-sovereign identity based on verifiable credentials (Aadhaar) and decentralised identifiers, built on the trust layer of Hyperledger Aries.” As a technology leader, Khadakbhavi frequently speaks at industry events to share DigiYatra’s success story. At one such event, he recounted, “I showcased our self-sovereign identity system and explained how we don’t store passenger PII. Afterward, a delegate approached me, thanked me for the clarification, and said, ‘I hadn’t installed DigiYatra because I thought you were storing my data for surveillance. Now that I understand, I’ll install the app.’” This encounter was a pivotal moment for Khadakbhavi and his team. By polling industry event audiences, he found that while 70-80% had installed DigiYatra, few knew the app did not collect PII. Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines, originally designed for the BFSI industry, have since permeated other sectors. KYC aims to prevent financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. However, as KYC compliance becomes more widespread, consumers may find the information requests intrusive and burdensome, potentially deterring them from engaging with businesses. Concerns also exist around how collected data may be used. On the flip side, KYC has enabled businesses to offer personalised digital services and enhance customer experiences. Khadakbhavi remarked, “Now that DigiYatra has a solid user base and high adoption rates, we aim to strengthen the platform’s credibility. The d-KYC campaign is designed to transparently communicate our unique and innovative approach to managing passenger PII—we don’t store your data and don’t know you.” The future of global aviation is poised to be far more interconnected and seamless, with initiatives like DigiYatra being piloted worldwide. The Khadakbhavi explained, “Imagine flying from Mumbai to Frankfurt and being able to share your credentials with Frankfurt Airport, skipping the 2-hour visa queue, and enjoying a seamless arrival process. That’s the value proposition of DigiYatra and One ID.” He continued, “Traditional frequent flyer or trusted traveller programs are restricted to domestic airports. But with DigiYatra and One ID, a passenger’s identity will be consistent across departure and destination airports.” Similarly, the European Digital Identity (EUDI) initiative aims to create a universal, secure digital identity and wallet. By integrating EUDI with DigiYatra’s decentralised system, India and EU citizens can enjoy seamless air travel between the two regions. According to Khadakbhavi, this represents a major step forward for global citizens. However, he acknowledges that many citizens don’t fully understand DigiYatra’s workings, often likening it to centralised identity management systems. “In the early days of our launch, we prioritised delivering services over addressing misconceptions. But negative chatter on social media persists, primarily from people who don’t grasp how our ecosystem is designed.” Khadakbhavi concluded, “During internal discussions, my colleague Few consumers trust companies to protect their personal data and are increasingly taking matters into their own hands to safeguard their privacy.

    "text": "Se indichi all’umanità l’infinito amore di Dio ti esponi alla persecuzione di coloro che, per la loro piccolezza, si sentono minacciati da così tanta grandezza. E in fondo è questa sempre la ragione che ha portato al martirio di tanti testimoni del Vangelo. Perché nella lotta tra assoluta immanenza e totale trascendenza sono i puri di cuore a soccombere, per lasciare che le loro vite diventino segni di luce. Proprio come segno di una parola controcorrente fu san Tommaso Becket, vescovo e martire vissuto nel XII secolo. Nato a Londra verso il 1117, arcidiacono e collaboratore di Teobaldo, arcivescovo di Canterbury, Tommaso divenne cancelliere per volere del re Enrico II, suo amico, che lo scelse, poi, come successore di Teobaldo nel 1161. Tommaso, però, da arcivescovo difese i diritti e la libertà della Chiesa davanti all’ingerenza del re. Nel 1164 per non aver riconosciuto le “Costituzioni di Clarendon” dovette fuggire in Francia, dove rimase in esilio per sei anni. Al rientro sconfessò i vescovi che erano scesi a patti col re, il quale, infastidito, si augurò che qualcuno gli togliesse di mezzo Becket. Un invito raccolto da quattro cavalieri armati che si diressero verso Canterbury per uccidere il vescovo. Becket fu avvisato ma restò al suo posto, consapevole che il suo ruolo di guida, pastore e testimone del Vangelo veniva prima della sua stessa vita: venne pugnalato nella Cattedrale, vestito dei paramenti sacri, il 23 dicembre 1170. Tre anni più tardi fu canonizzato da papa Alessandro III. Altri santi. San Davide, re e profeta (X sec. a.C.); san Martiniano di Milano, vescovo (V sec.). Letture.

    "text": "In a heartwarming encounter amidst the scorching sun of south Texas, Charlie McCullough, one of the participants in the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage, paused during the pilgrimage’s passage through Victoria to engage with a curious bystander.\nThis young man, hailing from a Protestant background and having grown up in foster care, expressed a multitude of inquiries regarding the purpose and significance of this grand assembly of Catholics.\nMcCullough, taking the time to converse with him, was deeply moved by their interaction.\nAs the pilgrimage progressed, McCullough found himself face to face with the same young man once more. Astonishingly, the encounter had sparked a profound spiritual awakening within him.\nNot only had he been inspired to engage in prayer for the first time in years, but he also expressed a desire to continue accompanying the pilgrimage, despite not yet being a member of the Catholic faith.\nReflecting on this encounter, McCullough expressed his hope for a reunion with the young man in the afterlife, emphasizing the transformative power of pilgrimage experiences in fostering connections and inspiring spiritual growth.\nTestimony of Transformation: Perpetual Pilgrims Share Insights During a press conference on Wednesday, McCullough, along with several fellow Perpetual Pilgrims, shared their reflections on the journey thus far.\nMcCullough highlighted the profound impact of pilgrimage in revealing the inherent goodness within individuals, attributing it to the divine presence guiding their collective journey.\nThis sentiment resonates deeply with the ethos of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage, which seeks to foster unity and spiritual renewal among participants.\nThe Juan Diego Route: A Journey of Faith and Culture The southern route of the pilgrimage, known as the Juan Diego Route, traverses through the culturally vibrant landscape of south Texas, beginning in Brownsville.\nThis route, characterized by its distinctly Hispanic expressions of Catholicism, serves as a testament to the rich tapestry of faith and culture within the region.\nAgainst the backdrop of the Rio Grande Valley, hundreds of Catholics converge, united in their shared devotion to the Eucharist and their commitment to spiritual pilgrimage.\nA Convergence of Faith and Community The participation of hundreds of Catholics in the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage reflects a profound convergence of faith and community.\nAmidst the challenges posed by the relentless sun and arduous journey, individuals like McCullough embody the spirit of compassion and inclusivity, reaching out to those seeking spiritual nourishment.\nTheir testimonies serve as a beacon of hope, inspiring others to embark on their own journeys of faith and discovery.\nConclusion: A Journey of Faith, Unity, and Transformation The National Eucharistic Pilgrimage stands as a testament to the enduring power of faith to unite diverse communities and transform lives.\nThrough encounters like the one between McCullough and the young bystander in Victoria, the pilgrimage transcends mere physical distance, fostering connections that resonate on a spiritual level.\nAs participants continue their journey towards Indianapolis, they carry with them the seeds of renewal and transformation, sowing them in the hearts of all who encounter their witness.",
