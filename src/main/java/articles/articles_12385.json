    "title": "Hungary Offers Ukrainians A Safe Haven From Conscription",
    "text": "Ukrainians who fled to Hungary to avoid being drafted for war are “safe” in Hungary. Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen has said that Budapest will not allow refugees “to be sent to their deaths” via conscription in the war.\nWe all know the rulers start the wars but aren’t the ones who will be fighting them. They have always demanded a blood sacrifice from the slaves. Whether it’s conscription, a draft, or anything else, forcing another human to kill or be killed is the absolute height of enslavement of human beings.\nSemjen told Hungarian broadcaster ATV on Monday that Budapest “would not extradite refugees to Ukraine.” “We do not investigate whether, according to the Ukrainians, the person is conscripted or not. Based on basic humanity, we will not allow them to be sent to their deaths.” It’s difficult to find anyone in the ruling class concerned about humanity and morality, but it’s nice to know those feeling obvious slavery can find at least some relief.\n“Every refugee from Ukraine is completely safe with us and receives all the help,” he added.\nIn an effort to force Ukrainians of fighting age to return home, Ukrainian consulates abroad last month announced the “temporary suspension” of services to men between the ages of 18 and 60, who can no longer receive any necessary documents until they return home. A Washington Post report last week suggested that many Ukrainians living in the West are angered by the new policy, saying they feel they are being treated like traitors and potential prey for conscription officials. – RT\nSlave State Intensifies: Conscription In Ukraine Prompts Fear\nThe idea that anyone is free while ruling classes (governments) of any kind exist is becoming less and less of an illusion every day. Even the most numb statists are figuring out that freedom means no one else has authority or control over you or your property. It’s a slow process, but it’s coming along. The more brutal the masters become the faster people are going to figure it out too. That could be the only good news.",

    "text": "QBTS量子计算超越传统超算，运算速度领先百万年！股价一度飙涨近19%\n来源：华尔街见闻\n美东时间周三，量子计算概念股D-Wave Quantum股价一度涨近18.8%。过去两个交易日，该股已飙升25%。\n此前该公司宣布，其退火量子计算机在解决复杂磁性材料模拟问题时，性能超越了世界上最强大的传统超级计算机之一，标志着量子计算在现实世界问题上的巨大突破。\n受D-Wave突破性研究的带动，量子计算概念股集体走强。IonQ一度涨12%，Rigetti Computing一度涨5.8%，Quantum Computing一度涨10%，SkyWater Technology一度涨4.8%，Arqit Quantum一度涨8%。\n研究突破：不到20分钟完成超级计算机需百万年的任务\nD-Wave的最新研究成果已通过同行评审，正式发表在《科学》杂志上。研究表明，D-Wave已利用量子计算机成功模拟磁性材料的特性。\n据D-Wave称，其量子计算机在不到20分钟内完成了磁性材料模拟，而使用美国橡树岭国家实验室最先进的超级计算机执行同样任务，将耗时近百万年，并消耗超过全球一年的总电力。\n这一突破对磁性材料的生产具有重要意义，因为磁性材料广泛应用于传感器、智能手机、电机和医疗成像设备等领域。D-Wave高级首席科学家Andrew King表示：\n此次取得计算优势的Advantage2原型机，已通过D-Wave的Leap实时量子云服务向客户开放。企业和研究机构现在可以直接使用D-Wave的量子计算能力，进行材料科学、物理模拟等实际应用研究。\nD-Wave因采用“量子退火”计算模式而备受关注，这是一种专注于大规模优化问题的量子计算方法，如确定车辆路径规划等应用场景。公司表示，日本NTT Docomo和加拿大Pattison食品集团等客户已经在使用其量子优化技术。\nD-Wave的“量子霸权”主张遭质疑，专家称传统计算机仍具可比性\n该论文引发学术界热议，遭到了部分科学家的质疑。据西蒙斯基金会平顶研究所量子物理计算中心研究科学家Miles Stoudenmire称，D-Wave的研究存在问题，因为传统计算机同样能够取得可比的模拟结果。\nStoudenmire及其团队发布了一篇论文，指出D-Wave的研究在某个特定时间点是成立的，但其测试的传统计算方法仅限于去年该论文初版发布时的最佳方案。自那以后，科学家们发现了新的方法，证明传统计算机在材料模拟方面并不如D-Wave宣称的那样落后。\nStoudenmire说道：“我们的意思是，这个问题在某个时间点上并没有真正击败传统计算机，再试一次吧。’”\n针对这一质疑，D-Wave首席开发官Trevor Lanting回应称，Flatiron团队并未完整模拟D-Wave论文中所涉及的晶格几何结构、规模和模拟深度。他表示：“我们相信，传统计算机无法完全复现我们所取得的全部研究成果。”\n此外，D-Wave所使用的“量子霸权”一词本身也存在争议。国际数据公司（IDC）量子计算分析师Heather West指出，量子计算领域近年来已更倾向于使用“量子优势”或“量子实用性”，即量子计算机在解决某项业务或科学问题时，能比传统计算机更快、更准确且成本更低。\n然而，D-Wave仍坚持其研究成果证明了“量子霸权”。D-Wave高级科学家Andrew King表示：“我们解决了一个重要的问题，而该问题对最先进的传统计算方法而言完全不可解，这正是我们称之为‘量子霸权’的原因。”",

    "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Invests $110 Million in Meat and Poultry Processing to Strengthen Food Supply Chain, Increase Competition, and Lower Food Costs To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested a total of over $700 million in 48 states and Puerto Rico for projects that help to expand the nation’s independent meat and poultry processing capacity\nWASHINGTON, July 11, 2024 – U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack announced today that the Biden-Harris Administration is making investments that will strengthen American food supply chains, increase independent meat and poultry processing capacity, create more, new and better markets for producers, and lower food costs.\nThanks to funding from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, USDA is investing nearly $110 million through the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program (MPPEP) and the Local Meat Capacity (Local MCap) Grant Program .\n“The Biden-Harris Administration and USDA are advancing a sustainable vision of agriculture that prioritizes the needs of hardworking producers and small businesses and keeps rural communities strong,” said Secretary Vilsack. “Thanks to historic resources from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, USDA is working to give farmers and ranchers a fairer chance to compete in the marketplace, which will increase local food options and lower costs for American families.”\nThe investments are part of USDA’s efforts to create a more competitive agricultural system, advance President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, and support the Administration’s Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain , which dedicates resources to expand independent processing capacity. Together these actions help to lower food costs by spurring competition and strengthening supply chains.\nMeat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program\nUSDA is partnering with the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund to provide more than $83 million in grants to 24 independent processors in 15 states under the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program (MPPEP) . The funding, made available through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, will help build new processing plants, create hundreds of jobs, give local producers and entrepreneurs better business opportunities, and give consumers more options at the grocery store. For example:\nSimla Frozen Food Locker Co. LLC is receiving a $450,000 grant to build a new facility across the street from their existing facility in rural Colorado to expand their processing capacity. The company processes, beef, hogs, chicken, turkeys, lamb, goats, and wild game. This project will allow the family-run business to receive USDA inspection and sell locally-produced proteins into wholesale markets such as restaurants and grocery stores. The company expects to serve 160 additional producers and create four full-time jobs through this project. McRez Packing International LLC is receiving a $390,000 grant to refurbish a previously mothballed industrial facility in New York to expand processing capacity. The company is a new small processor of cattle, hogs, chicken, turkey, sheep, and goats. Their target customers are local, underserved farmers and dairy and beef producers. The project is expected to serve up to 2,500 new producers and create 110 full-time jobs. North State Processing LLC is receiving a $10 million grant to build a new facility in Hamlet, North Carolina to process cattle, ostrich, emu, water buffalo and alpaca. A new processing company created by local and experienced North Carolina producers, the company anticipates serving 37 producers and creating 54 full-time jobs through this project. NF Packing Inc. is receiving a $1.4 million grant to build and equip a new processing facility for its start-up business in Walworth County, Wisconsin. The company anticipates serving 75 producers and creating 20 full-time jobs as a result of this project. Details on all of the awards are available online.\nUSDA’s Rural Development has provided 59 awards totaling over $291.4 million through MPPEP to expand processing capacity and strengthen the food supply chain. MPPEP is funded by President Biden’s American Rescue Plan.\nLocal Meat Capacity Grant Program\nUSDA is awarding $26.9 million to 33 projects in 23 states through the Local Meat Capacity (Local MCap) grant program to expand processing within the meat and poultry industry. Today’s announcement builds on the first round of $9.5 million awarded to 42 projects announced in March 2024 .\nThis second set of awards through Local MCap is for both Equipment Only and Processing Expansion project types. Simplified equipment only projects fund projects from $10,000 to $250,000 to purchase processing equipment such as meat grinders, stuffers, and smokers. Processing expansion projects are eligible to receive between $100,000 and $5 million to increase processing or rendering capacity through activities such as facility upgrades, equipment purchases, and training. For example:\nWhite Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia, is a family-owned meat company that will use a Local Meat Capacity grant to support the cost of converting its poultry processing facility into a dual use facility that can also process lambs, goats, and hogs. It is anticipated this will expand their livestock processing capacity by 30%. Nordik Meats is a small, independently owned meat processing facility in Southwest Wisconsin. The business will use a Local Meat Capacity grant to purchase a grinder, a meatball maker, and packaging equipment to expand processing capacity and serve an additional 50 local producers. The equipment will provide local producers with the ability to create new value-added products for local consumers, maximize the value of their animals, utilize byproducts, and increase animal harvest. Nordik Meats will increase the number of livestock processed annually by 100% over two years, implement new processing technologies, train 12 existing staff, hire four new employees, and benefit 350 local small family farms. Seven Hills Food Co. in Lynchburg, Virginia, is a full-service meat packaging company and a wholesaler of premium meat products sourced from small local family farms. The company will use a Local Meat Capacity grant to make plant enhancements to address bottlenecks currently hindering plant capacity while adding rendering capacity, new value-added products, and a farmer liaison for coordinating expanded production. This will support producers and meat companies in achieving the necessary scale, product quality, and efficiencies to access institutional and wholesale accounts. In April 2023, USDA announced up to $75 million available for Local MCap to fund innovative projects designed to build resilience in the meat and poultry supply chain by providing producers with more local processing options and strengthening their market potential. This grant program is targeted to support meat and poultry processors with smaller-scale projects, with a goal to increase processing availability and variety for local and regional livestock producers. The program is administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and is authorized by the American Rescue Plan.\nUSDA will announce additional awards at a later date. For more information, on Local MCap and to view a complete list of the awarded projects visit the AMS Local MCap webpage .\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, promoting competition and fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

    "title": "Arizona sheriffs reaffirm support for Israel, local Jewish community",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – The Arizona Sheriffs' Association reaffirmed their support for Israel and protecting the state's Jewish community. The events in Israel and Gaza have gained global attention since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Critics have argued that Israel's response to Hamas forces and civilians has been disproportional. Still, protests for both sides have continued around the world, sparking concerns about antisemitism. \"Unfortunately, the war in Israel and Gaza has given rise to crimes targeting Jews across the United States. Antisemitic attacks won't be tolerated here in Arizona,\" the [letter](https://x.com/AZSheriffs/status/1737911226720747965?s=20) signed by Yavapai County Sheriff David Rhodes and Navajo County Sheriff David Clause said. Rhodes and Clause are president and vice president of the association, respectively. \"As the leaders of the sheriffs offices around the state of Arizona, we stand against the recent spate of antisemitic criminal acts,\" the letter added. \"We also commit to defend the places of worship Jews frequent and investigate any threats against members of the Jewish community. We understand Jews remain targets of religious hatred and all law enforcement must stand up to protect these vital community members.\" The letter of support was in alignment with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. The group says it's \"dedicated to advancing U.S. national security interests in the Middle East, of which a critical pillar is a robust U.S.-Israel security relationship,\" according to its [website](https://jinsa.org/about/). The law enforcement leaders also addressed the question of how civilian deaths are a significant part of the conflict. \"Israel's right to defend itself isn't up for debate. And while all innocent civilian deaths leave a mark on humanity, Hamas and its ghoulish cohorts created a battlefield that deploys civilians as human shields - intended to be put in harms way for publicity,\" the letter states. Arizona, specifically Maricopa County, has a notable Jewish population. An ASU [study](https://thecollege.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-jewish-community-report.pdf) from 2019 estimated there are nearly 99,000 Jewish people in the area. The Center Square [reported](https://www.thecentersquare.com/arizona/article_33d8bb1a-66d6-11ee-a70e-5b858a02d14b.html) in October that Phoenix law enforcement was increasing security at synagogues in the city.",
