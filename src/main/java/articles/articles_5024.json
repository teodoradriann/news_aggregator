    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death.\nFour models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S.\nHealth Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country.\nThe metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

    "text": "Había muchas ganas de ver a Carolina Marín tras el sabor amargo que dejaron los Juegos Olímpicos de París y, por fin, Huelva ha podido encontrarse con su campeona y rendirle el homenaje que se merece. Ha sido este jueves en el Ayuntamiento de la capital onubense, hasta donde la volantista onubense se ha desplazado, primero para ser recibida por la alcaldesa, Pilar Miranda, y tener un encuentro con los medios de comunicación en el Salón de Plenos, y más tarde para saludar y dedicar unas palabras a sus paisanos desde uno de los balcones de la Casa Consistorial. Antes cientos de personas que se congregaron en la plaza de La Constitución y que recibieron a la volantista al son de las palmas onubenses y al grito de campeona, Marín recordaba con emoción sus comienzos: “En 2007 salí de Huelva rumbo a Madrid, en el coche de mis padres, con la intención de aprovechar una oportunidad que se me presentaba: podía entrenar con los mejores de España y un entrenador apostaba por mí para hacerme crecer. No sabía entonces que ya no volvería a vivir aquí, de momento. Atrás quedaban la avenida de Santa Marta, el pabellón Diego Lobato, mi casa y mi familia”. “Tenía muchos sueños por cumplir y he conseguido cumplir prácticamente todos. Lo que no sabía entonces aquella niña que salió de aquí es que un trocito de esta ciudad y de todos vosotros me acompañaría en Madrid y en cualquier lugar del mundo en el que estuviese”, añadía con emoción. Y por último, un deseo: “No sé que me deparará el futuro, quiero cuidarme, recuperarme bien y rodearme de los míos. Ojalá ese proceso me lleve a poder colgar la raqueta en una pista y que, si se dan las circunstancias, eso pueda suceder aquí, en nuestro Palacio de Deportes”. Y precisamente, la alcaldesa también aprovechaba la ocasión para recordar que el Ayuntamiento está gestionando la candidatura de Huelva como sede para albergar el Campeonato Europeo de Bádminton de 2026, un proyecto que, según la propia Miranda, sería “un homenaje al legado de Carolina Marín”.

    "text": "Detroit Pistons guard Cade Cunningham.\nThings aren’t going good for the Detroit Pistons. Not good at all, in fact.\nDetroit lost a nail biter to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. That in itself wasn’t big news. The Pistons have been doing a lot of losing in the past decade, after all.\nWhat was news — big news — was the fact that the loss was Detroit’s 27th straight, which set an NBA record for futility.\nThey’re arguably the worst NBA team ever and with two more losses, they’ll officially hold that title. The Philadelphia 76ers lost 28 straight, but that spanned the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. With games against the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors up next on the schedule, the odds would suggest that 29 straight is in the Pistons’ future, and they’ll end up doing it in one season.\nDetroit hasn’t won since its home opener back on October 28. The Pistons went winless in November and will likely be winless in December as well.\nThe Pistons are terrible. They’re are awful — historically so.\nAnd for former No. 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham, the Pistons are his team. Despite dropping 41 points in an attempt to help his franchise avoid ugly history, and even though he’s averaging 23 points, seven assists and 4.1 rebounds per game, Cunningham believes he should be the face of this ineptitude.\n“Everyday, I try to lead the squad,” Cunningham told the media after the game, per Omari Sankofa II. “I haven’t been successful with that. Two-and-28. I just felt like it’s only right that I come up and can speak for it, be the face for it. That locker room and everybody in there cares a lot. Everybody’s trying to do everything they can to win games and be successful. I put a lot of that weight on myself, for sure.”\nCunningham may be accepting responsibility for this team, but he’s far from the reason for Detroit’s struggles in 2023. He’s far from the person who deserves the blame.\nThere’s owner Tom Gores, who is seemingly aloof and can’t find the balance between meddling in his team and staying put across the country in California. There’s general manager Troy Weaver, who has constructed arguably the worst put-together roster of all time. There’s head coach Monty Williams, who Gores handed a six-year, $78.5 million contract to this offseason. Right now, he’s making $39.2 million a win.\nThe Pistons are 2-28 and may not win 10 games this season.\nCunningham would be an all-star on any other team. With this thrown together collection of centers and injured veterans, though, he’s unfortunately left taking the blame.\nWant more articles like this?

    "title": "Unlocking Secrets of the Mauthausen Liberation: Search for Spanish Victims of Nazi Camps on the Rise - World Today News",
    "text": "This Sunday marked the 79th anniversary of the liberation of Mauthausen. A date called the Day of Praise for the Spaniards Deported to the Nazi Concentration Camps and for all the Victims of the Nazis is celebrated in our country, because the government approved it in 2019. Coinciding with this anniversary, the Arolsen Archive, which protects most of the original documents related to the victims of National Socialism, has taken into account the applications received in the past year. “We don’t know exactly why, but the number of requests for information and documents, as well as consultation of our online archive, has increased dramatically around the world ,” he tells elDiario.es Floriane Azoulay, director of the Arolsen Archive. “It is not known for certain whether the current situation and the feeling of insecurity caused by events such as Russia ’s attack against Ukraine and the threat to democratic values in many countries of the world also give impact on this increase.” In 2023, this German-based institution received more than 20,000 requests asking about the fate of around 28,000 Hitler’s victims. A figure that represents an increase of 30% compared to 2022. The increase is even greater when we see the figures of the consultations that have been carried out. a very comprehensive online archive : nearly 700,000, 43% more than the previous year. Another relevant task that comes to the Arolsen Archive is to trace the descendants of the owners of watches, rings and other items taken by the Nazis from their victims. Last year, the work of volunteers connected to this institution made it possible to deliver 180 envelopes with the personal belongings of as many prisoners from the Nazi concentration camps. The highest figure is doubling what was reached in 2022. In Spain, the total figures are far lower than the requests that come from Poland, France or Germany , countries that had a much higher number of victims of Nazism. However, proportionally, the increase in the interest of the Spanish in this subject is slightly higher than the average: “We had 34% more requests than in 2022,” summarizes on Floriane Azoulay. “We received 179 direct inquiries about 333 Spanish victims of Nazism and more than 7,500 users of the online archive came from Spain, which also shows the growing interest. We also see that the number of Spanish followers on our social media channels continues to increase,” he explains. Even visiting a concentration camp does not automatically act as a vaccine against far-right ideologies. Fighting misinformation, discrimination and hatred is a huge social task The director of the archives that preserve National Socialism’s sad legacy is taking credit for its success #StolenMemory traveling show (Stolen Memory) is being presented in several cities in Spain: “Now we are more known as an institution than a few years ago.” Azoulay also emphasizes the importance of knowing the past, although it is only one more tool to face the rise of realism throughout the planet: “It is important to look us back to get a better understanding of today and to recognize the dangers that threaten democracy. But even visiting a concentration camp does not automatically act as a vaccine against extremist ideologies. Fighting misinformation, discrimination and hatred is a huge social task. We believe that our mission is to make historical knowledge about Nazi persecution accessible and to pass it on in a way that gives young people the opportunity to think, gather knowledge and thus build a bridge to the problems of today’s society. – today. Spanish Students in the Arolsen Archives In Spain, although they are not the majority, there are more and more educational institutions that encourage their students to study and learn about the history of their comrades who ended up in camps of the Nazis. For years, associations such as Amical de Mauthausen or Triángulo Azul have been working on the issue with high schools and organizing trips for students to visit the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. A more recent example is that of the IES Tirso de Molina in Madrid in which students participate in a project developed by the Geography and History department called “Spanish in concentration camps during the Second World War.” One of the teachers involved is José Ángel Romera: “In this project, 4th year ESO students look for information about unknown people who were in these areas, about concepts such as holocaust or genocide and also about the connections of victims. It is our duty as teachers to make our classes count so that students learn about the lives of men and women who do not appear in official history, but who also fought to achieve democratic values in Europe. Without these characters and their testimony, without these faces and names, history is not built, and it is fair to restore their part in the story of our country.” At the beginning of this course, one of her students, Gisell Marian Vallejos, presented her with a different challenge for the first time that made her discover the value of the Arolsen Archive: “She told us that we -her husband’s grandfather had been in a concentration camp. This spark led us to investigate that man: Antonio Cortés Maya. Consulting various databases they discovered that at just 21 years old, this man from Granada born in the caves of Sacromonte was murdered in Gusen, Mauthausen Slaughterhouse . Another professor then told them about the Arolsen Archives and so, on their website, they found the first original documents from the Nazi era in which Antonio Cortés was cited: “Then we contacted Arolsen by email in case they had more files that had not been digitized. . Two weeks later they sent us more documents about Antonio: concentration camp entry lists, transfer records, death certificates, the date of his cremation in the Gusen crematorium… Although there are gaps still, we managed to learn a little more about Antonio. The experience has been a joy not only for Gisell and the rest of the students, but also for the teachers: “For me it has meant opening new spaces in my work: the process of historical research and access and discovery of primary sources in archives, which we work very little in Secondary and Baccalaureate Education,” said José Ángel. “This allowed us to develop students’ digital competence, teaching them to find primary sources with historical and ethical criteria. At the same time, he has been developing research for characters that have been ignored in our recent history that must be valued and named in order to improve our democratic memory. ” 2024-05-05 19:45:18 #Spanish #victims #Nazism #sought #Arolsen #archive #Knowledge #vaccine #extreme #elDiario.es Related posts: Electronic games threaten your children's mental health and threaten you with mental disorders Foliar Fertilization Industry Size by Share 2021 Research Report, Opportunities, Challenges, Trends,...

    "text": "MUMBAI: Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police, in its reply to the court, objected to Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s claim that Maharashtra State Co-Operative Bank (MSCB) office bearers, including NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, had committed cheating while auctioning the sick sugar mills at throwaway prices to their kin.Submitting that ED had no right to file an intervention plea despite an earlier one being rejected by the court, EOW filed its reply against the application which opposed the closure report by EOW in the Rs 25,000-crore MSCB scam. EOW said even after further investigations were conducted, it was found that no cognizable offence had been committed. Hence, the closure report was submitted.The development comes days after an article in the RSS organ 'Organiser' attributed BJP's poor performance in LS polls in state to its alliance with Ajit Pawar, and amid reports of state BJP and Shiv Sena functionaries urging their netas to 'remove NCP from the Mahayuti'.The Rs 25,000 crore MSCB scam case highlights the alleged irregularities in auctioning of sick sugar mills by MSCB, which was reportedly controlled by senior politicians who allegedly benefited from auctioning of these mills to their kin. ED had alleged cheating, misconduct, and money laundering in the auctioning of the four sick mills and linked the suspicious transactions with Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra Pawar, Shiv Sena's Arjun Khotkar, and companies of NCP (SP) leaders Rohit Pawar and Prajakt Tanpure.ED informed the court that it had shared its findings with EOW and stated that it is an affected party as their money laundering case is based on EOW's FIR in the scam that was registered on Bombay HC's directions. In response, EOW submitted its reply in the court recently stating that the court had earlier rejected the ED's similar intervention application.",

    "title": "La production de Boeing en partie paralysée par sa première grève inédite depuis 2008",
    "text": "La production de Boeing en partie paralysée par sa première grève inédite depuis 2008\nL’\narrêt de travail a débuté après le rejet massif du projet de nouvelle convention collective, négocié depuis mars par Boeing et l’antenne locale du syndicat des machinistes (IAM) et qui devait succéder à celle datant de 2008 qui expirait jeudi à minuit. Les plus de 33 000 syndiqués de l’avionneur dans la région de Seattle - sur quelque 170 000 employés du groupe - ont rejeté l’accord annoncé le 8 septembre à 94,6 % et approuvé un débrayage à 96 %, selon Jon Holden, président de l’IAM-District 751. Il a également annoncé un recours contre Boeing auprès de l’agence fédérale chargée du droit du travail (NRLB) pour pratiques déloyales pendant les négociations. La dernière grève, en 2008, avait duré 57 jours.\nRetards. Face au mécontentement des adhérents, M. Holden avait toutefois affirmé ne pouvoir « garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève ». Ce débrayage paralyse les deux grandes usines d’assemblage de Renton et d’Everett, qui produisent le best-seller\n737 MAX, le 777 et le 767 (version cargo et ravitailleur militaire), dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards. La production d’autres sites, notamment une usine de pièces détachées à Portland (Oregon) tout proche, est également arrêtée, tout comme le réusinage de dizaines de 787 Dreamliner effectué à Everett depuis plusieurs mois. En revanche, l’assemblage du Dreamliner n’est pas perturbée à ce stade car l’usine se trouve en Caroline du Sud (est) et n’est pas concernée par cette convention collective.\nL’avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60 %) à la remise des avions. Il peut livrer ceux ayant reçu le feu vert du régulateur FAA avant la grève mais son rythme de production fonctionne au ralenti depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d’Alaska Airlines. « Pour un Boeing financièrement chancelant, une grève est la dernière chose dont il avait besoin », selon Leeham News, site spécialisé dans l’aviation. D’après les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d’affaires. « La grève va affecter la production, les livraisons et les activités, et elle va menacer notre reprise », a affirmé vendredi matin Brian West, directeur financier de Boeing, lors d’une conférence organisée par une banque.\n« La grève injecte tellement d’incertitudes » qu’il s’est refusé à toute prévision pour 2024 et 2025, assurant que la priorité était de « préserver nos liquidités ». « Le message selon lequel l’accord de principe conclu avec les dirigeants de l’IAM n’est pas acceptable pour ses membres est clair », avait réagi Boeing, se disant « prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord ». Une semaine après sa prise de fonction le 8 août, le nouveau patron de l’avionneur Kelly Ortberg s'était engagé à « réinitialiser » la relation avec le syndicat. Vers 17h20 GMT, l’action Boeing chutait de 3,72 % à la Bourse de New York.\nPériode difficile. La convention collective rejetée prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25 % sur quatre ans, un engagement d’investissements dans la région, ainsi que la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - autour de Seattle, ce qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies. Boeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève. Sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019 (346 morts), et moult problèmes de qualité de la production. « Ce n’est un secret pour personne : notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune », prévenait mercredi soir M. Ortberg, exhortant les employés à ne pas « sacrifier » les progrès futurs en raison de « frustrations liées au passé ».\nMais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+40 % initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant. « On nous a bradés », a lancé jeudi à l’AFP Kamie Bryan, employée chez Boeing depuis 18 ans. « Ils parlent d’une augmentation de 25 %, mais ce n’est pas le cas », a déclaré Paul Janousek, dénonçant une présentation « trompeuse » par Boeing. Selon cet électricien de 55 ans, dont treize chez l’avionneur, son augmentation n’atteindrait qu’environ 9 % du fait de la suppression d’une prime annuelle. Selon le règlement de l’IAM, les grévistes recevront 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d’arrêt de travail.\nJason REDMOND, avec Elodie MAZEIN à New York\n© Agence France-Presse\nSur le même thème\n-\nEtats-Unis: des écoles évacuées dans la ville ciblée par la rhétorique anti-migrants de Donald TrumpOhio - Des responsables de la ville américaine de Springfield ont annoncé avoir ordonné l'évacuation vendredi de plusieurs écoles, dans un contexte de critiques infondées de Donald Trump contre les migrants haïtiens qui vivent dans la commune\n-\nL'ascension et la chute d'Enviva, superstar de l'énergie verteL'entreprise a fait fortune grâce au granulé de bois avant de faire un pari désastreux qui l’a conduit à la faillite\n-\nBoeing: les machinistes des usines du 737 et du 777 à Seattle ont voté la grève totaleLe géant de l'aéronautique américain doit finalement faire face à une grève à partir du vendredi 13 septembre à minuit, paralysant la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo et occasionnant plusieurs milliards d'euros de pertes additionnelles potentielles\n-\nLa génération X approche de l’âge de la retraite, mais la réalité est encore bien loin d’être un lit de rosesLes représentants de la « génération oubliée », nés entre 1965 et 1980, ont commencé leur carrière, alors que l’univers du travail aux USA était en proie à de profonds changements\n-\nUSA 2024: un débat Harris-Trump au goût amer pour les républicainsAprès l’offensive de la candidate démocrate, l’ancien président va-t-il accepter un nouveau débat ?

Les conditions météorologiques sur la montagne sont trop dangereuses pour permettre aux autorités de les sortir de cette situation. Elles n’ont pas pu atteindre le groupe, puisque celui-ci pourrait se trouver sous 40 à 100 pieds de neige.\nLes trois skieurs, qui sont désormais déclarés «disparus», se sont rendus au sommet du mont en hélicoptère pour y pratiquer l’héliski, ont précisé les Alaska State Troopers dans un communiqué de presse.\nCe dérivé du ski alpin consiste à se rendre sur des pistes qui ne sont pas accessibles à pied ou en voiture, donc généralement sur des pistes très difficiles et réservées aux experts. En plus de la neige qui n’est pas tapée comme celles dans des stations de ski, les sportifs doivent contourner des arbres et des avalanches.\nEn matinée, mercredi, ces derniers évaluaient le risque de danger pour les autorités d’essayer de retrouver les skieurs.\n«Nous ne pensons pas qu’aucune de ces personnes n’a survécu l’avalanche», a mentionné un porte-parole du Département de la sécurité publique de l’Alaska à CNN.",
