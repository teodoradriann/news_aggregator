    "text": "2024-04-11 22:10:40\nThe Banque de France confirmed Thursday that it still forecasts 0.2% growth for French economic activity in the first quarter of 2024, an estimate “not incompatible” according to its director general of statistics with the 1% annual growth on which the government is counting. .\n“Our estimates suggest that GDP would increase by + 0.2% in the first quarter, driven by market services,” indicates the central bank in its new economic report. This estimate for the first quarter is “not incompatible with a forecast of 1% growth over the year”, estimated Olivier Garnier, general director of statistics, studies and international of the Banque de France, during a press briefing. , but this “would require some acceleration of activity in subsequent quarters”.\nHe recalled that the Banque de France rather estimated that with 0.2% growth in the first quarter, French economic activity should experience growth of 0.8% growth in 2024, in accordance with what the institution had indicated in its previous economic report published at the beginning of March .\nHowever, “it will depend on the following quarters”, indicated Olivier Garnier, and INSEE is also likely to revise upwards during the year a quarterly growth figure already published, creating a pleasant surprise, as had been the case. cases in 2023 for the second quarter figures.\nThe first quarter driven by merchant services In detail, growth in the first quarter of 2024 would be marked by a “divergence between industry and services”, explained Olivier Garnier. GDP would be “driven this quarter by market services, thanks in particular to household services, information, transport services and business services, while activity in commerce would be stable”, specifies the Bank of France in its press release.\n“On the other hand, industry and construction would be in decline” over the quarter, adds the general director of statistics, studies and international of the institution. As for the manufacturing industry, the increase in production in February (+0.9%) would not be enough to compensate for the drop of 1.6% in January and the stability of March. On the construction side, “activity changed little in March, both in structural work and in finishing work”, notes the Banque de France, and order books remain “degraded in this sector” over the quarter.\nFor the start of the second quarter, the picture should still be mixed. According to the Banque de France’s forecasts for April, “activity would increase again in services, more slightly in industry and would deteriorate in the structural work of buildings”.\n#Banque #France #confirms #expects #growth #quarter",

    "text": "Chicago Plan Commission approves controversial quantum computing project at old South Works site\nOrganizations and residents oppose the speed at which the project has received approvals and vowed to keep fighting for a community benefits agreement.\nDespite a number of protests from community groups and residents, the Chicago Plan Commission approved plans on Thursday to rezone more than 400 acres of land at the former U.S. Steel South Works facility, which will become a new quantum computing campus.\nMore than 70 people signed up to voice their opinion on the project during the commission’s nearly six-hour meeting, which was held at Harold Washington College. Support for the project was split, with some organizations saying that they plan to ensure environmental issues, new jobs and other community concerns are addressed by the developers.\n“We’re going to continue fighting for community benefits for the South Works site,” said Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of the Alliance of the Southeast, an interfaith coalition of churches, schools, businesses and community organizations. ASE has been among the most prominent voices pushing for a community benefits agreement at the site. In October, it [held a news conference](https://chicago.suntimes.com/technology/2024/10/18/quantum-computing-campus-project-southeast-side-residents) where neighbors called on city and state officials to slow down development in order to secure a community benefits agreement.\nGroups such as Coalition for a South Works CBA have asked for a community benefits agreement for any development proposed at the old South Works site.\nPsiQuantum, based in Palo Alto, California, announced plans in July to build the world’s first [commercially useful quantum computer](https://chicago.suntimes.com/technology/2024/07/25/psiquantum-steel-south-works-quantum-computer-johnson-darpa) at the vacant site. It will anchor the 128-acre Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park, which could be home to other technology and innovation companies. Developer Related Midwest said it’s currently in conversations with a “major” employer for the north end of the site, separate from the campus.\nThe 440-acre development, 8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive, will be completed in phases over the next four to six years. Related Midwest said it has plans to expand and enhance access to more than 100 acres of parkland. There are also plans to have public artwork, bird-safe technology to [minimize collisions](https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2024/09/24/mccormick-place-lakeside-center-completes-bird-safe-glass-project-in-time-for-fall-migration), native landscaping and transit infrastructure, among other offerings.\nPhase one will be the Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park, which includes the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and PsiQuantum. PsiQuantum’s facility will be co-developed by real estate firm CRG and Related Midwest. Lamar Johnson Collaborative will design the first phase of the park. If approved, developers could break ground in the first quarter of 2025.\nAld. Daniel La Spata (1st) and Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) abstained from the vote. Chicago Plan Commission Vice Chair Andre Brumfield recused himself from voting. The vote was otherwise unanimous.\nThe project will head to the City Council Zoning Committee before moving to a full-Council vote.\nAld. Greg Mitchell (7th) voiced his support for the massive project on Thursday. He applauded the level of engagement at the commission’s meeting and said the development is step one in kick-starting economic development on the Southeast Side.\n“This is going in the right direction,” Mitchell said. “Are we there yet? No.”\nThe site is projected to have a $50 billion to $65 billion economic impact in the region by 2035 and create thousands of jobs.\n“This is real,” Ald. Peter Chico (10th) said of the investment. “This is real dollars investing in the Southeast Side.”\nFriends of the Parks joined the chorus of organizations against the project. Interim Executive Director Gin Kilgore pointed out how big the entire site is compared to plans that have been shown so far. The quantum park is roughly one-fourth of the 440-acre site. “We should not rush to bring in the bulldozers,” Kilgore said.\nDevelopment proposals at the long-vacant site have seen their rise and fall over the years, since the steel mill’s closure in 1992. Over time, plans including thousands of new homes and a Solo Cup Co. factory were all abandoned due to lingering environmental concerns.\nThe Illinois Environmental Protection Agency previously said environmental remediation on the site is complete. It was evaluated as safe for public occupation in 1997. It was re-evaluated in 2006 and 2010, officials said in August during the first community development meeting. The project’s developers have held three community listening sessions since July.\nBut residents and community organizers urged for an independent environmental study and said the 2010 evaluation was too outdated.\nAnne Holcomb, of the environmental justice group ETHOS, said the group isn’t necessarily opposed to the project — they’re opposed to the “reckless speed” it’s moving at.\n“We’ve seen a lot of pretty pictures today, and in previous public meetings, we’ve heard a lot of really pretty presentations,” Holcomb said. “What they’re not showing you is what is in the ground.”\nChicago’s Chief Sustainability Officer Angela Tovar said there will be additional exploration of land contamination at the former South Works site. “Those concerns will be mitigated,” Tovar said.\nOther environmental concerns raised included the potential impact on nearby waterways and carbon emissions. PsiQuantum said its facilities will run on zero-carbon power, and smokestacks will not be used. The campus’s cryogenic cooling facilities will not use any chemical pollutants.\nQuantum computing creates infinite combinations of the binary bits used by computers to calculate larger and more complex problems. It could lead to the manufacturing of new medical drugs and make sensitive data almost impermeable to hacking, among other possibilities touted by experts — but many of those possibilities are yet to be realized.\nThis story has been updated to reflect community support was split.\n[Business](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business)",

    "text": "Cerca de 122,1 milhões de pessoas vivem longe de casa em todo o mundo devido a guerras, violência e perseguições, um recorde que quase dobra o número de 2015, indica um relatório publicado esta quinta-feira pela ONU.\nConflitos como os de Myanmar (antiga Birmânia), Sudão e Ucrânia continuam a ser os principais responsáveis por esta deslocação forçada, que inclui mais de 42,7 milhões de refugiados em países que não o de origem e 73,5 milhões de deslocados internamente, de acordo com o relatório da agência das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (ACNUR).\nDestes refugiados e deslocados internamente, 40% são menores de idade e 7% têm mais de 60 anos.\nOs números recorde, atualizados até abril, surgem num contexto de \"relações internacionais voláteis\" e de conflitos marcados por um enorme sofrimento para os civis, afirmou o Alto Comissário do ACNUR, Filippo Grandi, no lançamento do relatório.\nDe acordo com o documento, a Síria deixou de ser o país com mais refugiados e deslocados em todo o mundo (13,5 milhões), tendo sido ultrapassada pelo Sudão, com 14,3 milhões de pessoas deslocadas pela guerra civil.\nO Afeganistão ocupa o terceiro lugar, com 10,3 milhões de deslocados, e a Ucrânia a quarta posição, com 8,8 milhões.\nEm termos de refugiados em outros países, as quatro nações mencionadas tenham cada uma um número semelhante, cerca de seis milhões.\nEm termos de países de acolhimento, o Irão ocupa o primeiro lugar, com 3,8 milhões de refugiados, na maioria afegãos, seguindo-se a Turquia (3,1 milhões, na maioria sírios), Colômbia (2,8 milhões, principalmente da Venezuela), Alemanha (2,7 milhões) e Uganda (1,7 milhões).\nEm termos relativos, o Líbano lidera a lista, com um refugiado em cada oito habitantes, seguido do Chade e da Jordânia, onde a proporção é de um refugiado em cada 16 pessoas.\nO relatório do ACNUR inclui ainda estatísticas relativas aos países que recebem mais pedidos de asilo, uma lista encabeçada pelos Estados Unidos (729 mil só na primeira metade de 2024), seguidos do Egito (433 mil para todo o ano), Alemanha (229 mil), Canadá (174 mil) e Espanha (167 mil, muitos deles colombianos, venezuelanos e ucranianos).\nNuma perspetiva positiva, 9,8 milhões de pessoas - um número notavelmente mais elevado do que noutros anos - regressaram a casa em 2024, incluindo dois milhões de sírios, um número que deverá aumentar acentuadamente em 2025, na sequência da queda do regime de Bashar al-Assad, no final do ano passado.\nEmbora o regresso de deslocados seja, em princípio, uma notícia positiva, o ACNUR observa que, em alguns casos, ocorreram num contexto adverso para estas populações, como é o caso do grande número de afegãos que estão a ser forçados a voltar ao país, ainda abalado pela violência, a partir dos vizinhos Irão e Paquistão.\nO ACNUR recorda no relatório que, contrariamente à perceção em muitos países desenvolvidos, 60% das pessoas deslocadas à força não abandonam o país de origem e que, dos refugiados que o fazem, dois em cada três vivem em países vizinhos e três em cada quatro em economias em desenvolvimento.\nA agência da ONU alertou ainda para o facto de que, embora o número de deslocados no mundo tenha quase duplicado em relação aos 65 milhões contabilizados em 2015, o financiamento da agência permanece quase ao mesmo nível, \"num contexto de cortes brutais na ajuda humanitária\".\nEmbora o relatório não detalhe esses cortes, fontes internas da agência indicaram nos últimos meses que, na sequência do congelamento das contribuições dos EUA, um dos seus principais contribuintes, a agência foi forçada a reduzir o pessoal em todo o mundo em cerca de 30%.\nPerante este cenário, a agência para os refugiados insta os dadores a continuarem a financiar os programas de assistência aos refugiados e deslocados, \"um investimento essencial para a segurança regional e mundial\".",

    "title": "Downtown Calgary park reopens following redevelopment",
    "text": "Posted Oct 3, 2024 5:03 pm. Last Updated Oct 3, 2024 5:16 pm. A park in Calgary’s Beltline neighbourhood has reopened to the public after significant redevelopment. The City of Calgary announced the official reopening of Humpy Hollow Park, located along the northwest corner of 17 Avenue SW and Centre Street, with a special celebration on Thursday. The city says the redevelopment has “transformed the Beltline park into a vibrant, welcoming space for residents to gather and socialize.” The new features post-redevelopment include better pedestrian access, an enclosed off-leash dog park, and a covered performing stage for events and social gatherings. The updated version of the park also features a new mural as part of the Beltline Urban Mural Project (BUMP). The changes were sparked by a community-led initiative to make better use of the space. The project cost $3.25M and the city says most of the funding came from the Beltline Community Investment Fund. “The Beltline Neighbourhoods Association (BNA), saw this park was unnoticed and under-utilized with a run-down playground and limited access from 17 Avenue,” says Coun. Courtney Walcott. “Now this space is home to a much-needed dog park and a covered stage and plaza, perfect for community events.” The park’s name came from a naming contest for school children in 1976. A 2020 city-led public engagement suggested residents wanted to keep the name. While the work on the park is finished, work on the historic McHugh House tied to the park is ongoing. The house was built in 1896 and is one of the oldest buildings in Calgary. It was relocated to the east side of the park from its original location on 18 Avenue SW. Humpy Hollow Park is open every day from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.",

    "text": "Valencia, España, vive una tragedia debido a una Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos, conocido como Dana, un fenómeno que ha generado varias emergencias en la zona. Sin embargo, otras regiones de ese país e inclusive naciones cercanas pueden sufrir los efectos, de acuerdo a las predicciones de los expertos. Con la llegada del otoño desde días atrás hay un fenómeno que ocurre en algunos países ubicados en Europa y son los torrenciales mediterráneos, los cuales generan un aumento en las lluvias a tal punto de que se pueden generar en días las precipitaciones equivalentes a meses, las cuales han incrementado en su intensidad en los últimos años debido a los efectos del cambio climático y al aumento de la temperatura global. Lea también: La emergencia meteorológica “no ha terminado todavía”, advirtió el rey de España Este fenómeno conocido como Dana ha dejado hasta el último reporte más de 150 víctimas mortales, entre las que hay un colombiano, según cifras del ayuntamiento de Valencia. Aunque el paso de este fenómeno ya ha dejado números desalentadores entre los valencianos, la emergencia no ha pasado, pues varias agencias meteorológicas le están siguiendo el paso a las precipitaciones y ya han dado sus pronósticos del siguiente destino. Para la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Amet), durante este jueves el fenómeno continuaría su desplazamiento por el norte, mientras que a partir del viernes la Dana seguiría al sur y al oeste, por lo que regiones como Andalucía y Extremadura están en alerta, además del país de Portugal. Otra de las predicciones de los meteorólogos es acerca de las lluvias, pues se prevé que en el país habrá lluvias durante el fin de semana. Sin embargo, estas serían con menor intensidad, ya que habrá un debilitamiento progresivo en la Dana. Las autoridades seguirán el fenómeno con diferentes herramientas como radares meteorológicos, imágenes satelitales y modelos numéricos de predicción, además los internautas le pueden seguir el paso a la Dana en línea a través del radar del Meteocat. Sigan leyendo: Aparecieron tres colombianos, miembros de una misma familia, que estaban desaparecidos por la DANA en España Debido a la magnitud de daños y a la pérdida de vidas humanas, el Gobierno de España ha decretado tres días de luto nacional, además de autorizar el despliegue de más de 1.000 efectivos de la Unidad Militar de Emergencia (UME) quienes han estado trabajando en conjunto con la Guardia Civil y los servicios de emergencia de las diferentes provincias. Para la búsqueda y el rescate de las víctimas, las autoridades han estado utilizando helicópteros, drones y perros especializados en la búsqueda de personas.

    "text": "(CNN) –– El director de un hospital en el norte de Gaza dijo que ya no pueden hacer frente a la afluencia de personas gravemente heridas y que tuvieron que trasladarlas a otro lugar.\nEl Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director del hospital Kamal Adwan en el norte de Gaza, le dijo a CNN este jueves que civiles gravemente heridos por un ataque aéreo israelí que tuvo lugar el miércoles contra una casa en el área de Beit Lahia no habían podido ser recibidos en el hospital. “Esos casos fueron trasladados a otro hospital por la falta de especialidades necesarias para el manejo de este tipo de lesiones”.\nBlinken afirma que Israel aceptó los términos de la retirada de Gaza en una\"propuesta puente\", a pesar de dichos de Netanyahu\nMuchos hospitales de Gaza carecen de personal y equipos después de diez meses de conflicto y la dificultad de acceso a gran parte de Gaza para las organizaciones de ayuda.\nAbu Safiya dijo que había escasez de combustible en Kamal Adwan.\n“Ahora estamos trabajando a la capacidad mínima en la prestación de servicios. La cantidad de combustible que tenemos no es suficiente para más de 24 horas”.\nDijo que alrededor de una decena de niños están en diálisis o con ventiladores. \"La falta de combustible significa el fin de la vida de estos niños\".\nAbu Safiya dijo que el combustible llegaba en “cantidades que apenas alcanzan para unos días”.\nDijo que otro problema era la propagación de enfermedades, ya que los programas de vacunación se retrasaron debido al conflicto.\n\"Nos han llegado un gran número de enfermedades de la piel e infecciones intestinales (...) Es necesario reactivar las vacunas y tomar las muestras necesarias\".\nA principios de este mes, el Ministro de Salud del Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, el Dr. Majed Abu Ramadan, dijo que Gaza estaba “enfrentando un desastre humanitario en todos los sentidos de la palabra. La agresión ha provocado la destrucción de más del 80% de la infraestructura sanitaria y la mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio”.\nRecuperan en Gaza los cadáveres de seis rehenes israelíes, según las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad Israelí\nRamadan dijo que los hospitales operativos “están funcionando parcialmente debido a los daños directos y la pérdida de personal médico calificado como consecuencia del desplazamiento forzado que enfrenta nuestro pueblo, así como a la falta de recursos, cortes de energía, escasez de combustible, falta de agua potable, alcantarillado, inundaciones, acumulación de desechos sólidos y propagación de epidemias”.\nEl Ministerio de Salud de Gaza informó el primer caso de polio la semana pasada, que atribuyó al desbordamiento de aguas residuales y a la falta de agua potable.\nDijo que \"se han completado los preparativos y arreglos para la campaña de vacunación para combatir la polio, dirigida a niños menores de 10 años, y la campaña está esperando la llegada de vacunas a Gaza\".\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
