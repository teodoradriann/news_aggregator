    "title": "Gazans Need A Little Jesus this Christmas - Israel365 News",
    "text": "With the war against Hamas raging, scores of Israeli soldiers having been killed in combat along with many more injured, and still some 130 hostages who were kidnapped from Israel on October 7 being held in captivity, it might be intuitive that this Christmas I would be praying for anything other than the swift and full eradication of Hamas, the safe return of all our soldiers including my son and son in law, and release of all the hostages. Then again, as an Orthodox Jew, one might think it odd that I would be praying for anything specifically on Christmas. But I am. I am praying for Gazans to get a little Jesus. As talks of another cease-fire loom, the UN and other international bodies pressing for a cessation of all combat (even without the return of all the hostages), I am looking to the day after the war ends. Whenever that may be. Israel has a different vision for what the day after will look like. The US, western powers, along with the Arab world still call for a two-state solution, as if stuttering a worn-out policy that has no meaning, and no practical means of implementation. Recently, Vice President Kamila Harris echoed apparent US policy that the two-state illusion is with Gaza and other areas under the authority of a Palestinian state, to be under (a perhaps revamped) PLO-led Palestinian Authority. Others have discussed an international (Arab-led) coalition to rebuild and provide long-term stability for Gazans, without Hamas or any terror organization controlling the territory and its population again. Most echo that they will only do so under the guise of the long-touted, and yet still impractical, two-state solution. Israel is not being so foolish because it knows that the PLO is nothing more than a kinder and gentler terror group that also does not accept Israel’s right to exist, incites terror, and pays pensions to terrorists as if they are national heroes. Even if it were a practical solution once upon a time, it is not practical now, and the idea is a gift to terrorists that if they keep slaughtering Jews, they will get a state. Eventually, Gaza will need to be rebuilt. No matter what, there are some two million Gazans who need a place to live. The destruction of Gaza has been commensurate with how deeply Hamas embedded itself among the population and within civilian infrastructure such as schools, mosques, hospitals, UN facilities, and residential areas. There’s lots of work to be done. Perhaps this time, unlike in 2007 when Hamas took control and began its reign of terror over the population, Gazans will want to get it right. If rebuilt properly, purging the terrorists, and supervised responsibly, Gaza can become a thriving entity like Singapore. Maybe, just maybe, there can be peace. Rebuilding needs to start from under the ground up, first with anything left of the underground city that’s a maze of terrorist tunnels being destroyed along with the evil Islamic ideology that birthed Hamas originally, and nurtured from Iran all these decades. But who can do the long-term full-time recovery that’s needed? It’s not clear that any of the Arab states individually, or as a consortium, can or are even willing to do so. Certainly not Islamists whether from Iran or Turkey or anywhere else. None of these would be objective players, each looking out for their own interests, also turning a blind eye to the smuggling of weapons that threaten Israel. The last thing Israel and Gaza need is a rebuilding of the extremist Islamic ideology at the foundation of rebuilding the territory, and resumption of arms smuggling. If there’s ever hope for a lasting peace, there needs to be an overhaul of more than the physical infrastructure. There needs to be a change of heart. I was asked in an interview recently if I thought Jesus should come back, suggesting that he would bring peace. I replied that I didn’t know if Jesus coming back would bring peace, but that Gazans sure could use a lot more Jesus. I responded that if it were up to me, Billy Graham would come back and hold months of crusades throughout Gaza. There are also many former Muslims who have become Christians, many speak Arabic and know the culture, who I would bring along as well. I’d be sure that from day one, Gazans are fed a diet of Christian faith to counteract the buffet of hate that they have ingested. I told my interviewer that the only chance I saw for real peace is that Gazans become real Christians. In doing so they will not just abandon Allah in favor of the God of Israel, but they will also come to love Israel: the Land, the people, and the State, as a realization of God’s promise to His people. I would send along Franklin Graham, Samaritan’s Purse, and other ministries that can bring thousands of volunteers of all backgrounds and skills, charged with education, medical and spiritual well-being, and physical reconstruction. Ministries like these can bring masses of the most faithful and committed volunteers. They will be the most objective, with the greatest ability to succeed in rebuilding Gaza by both genuinely loving and caring about Israel and its safety, but also about the well-being of Palestinian Arabs. They will not allow the restoration of a massive terrorist infrastructure under their noses as the UN, Red Cross, and other “humanitarian” groups have allowed over the decades. These are not contradictory. The best and safest way to change the situation and bring peace is for the masses of Gazans, and Palestinian Arabs in general, to convert to Christianity. Any Christian who understands the Biblical covenant between God and the Jewish people, that it’s eternal and unbreakable, will transform his or her heart. That’s how true peace can be achieved. This is not a task for the Jewish people. Our covenant is unique. We are meant to be a light unto the nations. Nobody wants to live in peace more than the Jewish and Israeli people. But to really bring lasting peace, we need an army of Christians to restore Gaza. It may sound crazy, an Orthodox Israeli Jew proposing a plan to establish peace in Israel not based on a mistaken formula of two states, but by calling for our neighbors living in spiritual darkness to become spiritual allies by becoming Christians. However, the reality is that [anger among Gazans toward Hamas is growing](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-777031?utm_source=jpost.app.apple&utm_medium=share) to such a degree that if presented a viable alternative, one based in morality that can bring prosperity, the ground is fertile for such an opportunity. Let’s pray that Gazans’ dissatisfaction with Hamas increases and that they all get a little Jesus this Christmas.",

    "title": "\"Ainda Estou Aqui\" é a primeira produção da América do Sul nomeada a Melhor Filme no Oscar",
    "text": "O filme brasileiro “Ainda Estou Aqui” fez história ao se tornar o primeiro longa sul-americano indicado ao Oscar de Melhor Filme. A lista de indicados foi anunciada pela Academia nesta quinta-feira (23).\nO título também se junta a “Roma” (2018) como um dos filmes da América Latina indicados à categoria. A produção mexicana de Alfonso Cuarón foi nomeada na edição de 2019.\n“Ainda Estou Aqui” também recebeu indicações nas categorias de Melhor Filme Internacional e Melhor Atriz, com Fernanda Torres.\nO longa é baseado em uma autobiografia, de mesmo nome, escrita por Marcelo Rubens Paiva. A trama retrata o desaparecimento do político Rubens Paiva, pai de Marcelo Rubens Paiva, durante a ditadura militar brasileira.\nO foco da trama é Eunice Paiva. Casada com Rubens Paiva e mãe de cinco filhos, ela passou a criá-los sozinha quando, em 1971, o marido foi preso, torturado e assassinado por agentes da ditadura.\nNa manhã desta quinta, o filme recebeu três indicações. A primeira delas foi ao Oscar de melhor filme estrangeiro, repetindo o feito de O Pagador de Promessas (1963), O Quatrilho (1996), O que é Isso, Companheiro? (1998) e Central do Brasil (1999). Neste ano, o filme concorre com A Garota da Agulha (Dinamarca), Emilia Pérez (França), A Semente do Fruto Sagrado (Alemanha) e Flow (Letônia).\nNa indicação de melhor atriz, Fernanda Torres concorre com Cynthia Erivo, Karla Sofía Gascón, Mikey Madison e Demi Moore. Já na categoria de melhor filme, os concorrentes são Anora, O Brutalista, Um Completo Desconhecido, Conclave, Duna: Parte 2, Emilia Pérez, Nickel Boys, A Substância e Wicked.\n“Agora, tudo é batalha. Em filme internacional, Emilia Pérez é o franco favorito. Teve 13 indicações, quase um recorde geral – e um recorde para filmes estrangeiros. Então é meio complicado enfrentar esse favoritismo. Tem uma reação contrária a este filme pela comunidade LGBT e dos mexicanos, o que pode nos favorecer se o negócio ficar muito grande. Mas é difícil mensurar isso”, explicou o crítico Chico Fireman.\n“Em melhor atriz, a Demi Moore tem uma narrativa de comeback muito forte e o filme é popular mas, ao mesmo tempo, estar num body horror (A Substância) não deixa o caminho tão fácil assim. Nisso, a Fernanda, uma interpretação mais clássica, sóbria, unanimemente elogiada, pode surpreender. Mas é raríssimo acontecer um prêmio para uma estrangeira nesta categoria. Foram apenas duas em 97 anos de Oscar. Em melhor filme, a indicação acho que já é um grande prêmio. Mas, enfim, agora é uma nova votação. As coisas ficam meio zeradas”, acrescentou.\nPara Renata de Almeida, o filme tem chances de conquistar o primeiro Oscar brasileiro.\n“Se está aí concorrendo é porque tem chance. Acho que tem chance como filme estrangeiro. Na categoria de melhor filme, acho que é mais difícil. Mas a Fernanda também tem chance. Ela está fantástica no filme, e além disso, ela tem esse carisma todo. E eles estão se dedicando muito, muito, para a promoção do filme [no exterior]. Mas eu acho que a gente já tem que comemorar desde hoje porque eles fizeram um filme lindo”.",

    "title": "Cake in the time of war, in Gaza",
    "text": "Cake in the time of war, in Gaza\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip — There is war in Gaza, and now, for some, there is also cake — with peanut butter cream, coconut flakes and sprinkles.\nBatool Cakes,\na professional bakery with three branches throughout Gaza, started baking cakes at its Rafah branch a month ago, for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began. It's surprisingly busy with orders in a city of tent camps, shelters and bread lines.\n\"We were shocked by the huge demand,\" says Ibrahim Abu Hani, head baker and co-owner of the family business.\nIt might sound jarring: a cake shop in Rafah, the southernmost city that has become swollen with the majority of Gaza's population, many of whom eat only one meal a day, and facing an Israeli threat to send in troops for a final battle against Hamas.\nSelling cake — while, at the opposite end of Gaza, in the battered north, Palestinians suffer extreme hunger.\nBut children need cheering up. Birthdays come only once a year. And couples won't let a war delay their weddings.\n\"We Gazans love life. People are pushing themselves to hope,\" Abu Hani says. \"Because there are no other options.\"\nThe first cake orders\nAbu Hani had not planned on making cakes during this war. He had to flee his home, like most people in Gaza.\nAs Rafah took in more than 1.5 million Palestinians fleeing the fighting, he kept the cake shop open, without cake, just to let people charge their phones for free. There's no electricity now in Gaza, and the bakery runs on solar power.\nA month ago, a man walked into the bakery. He told Abu Hani his son had been injured in the war, gone to the hospital, woken up from the anesthesia and said: \"My birthday has arrived. Where is the cake you promised?\"\n\"Should we work on the cake?\" Abu Hani wondered. He didn't have to think twice. He got started, using leftover ingredients in the bakery from before the war began.\nAs he was baking that first cake, another man walked into the shop. His little daughter was scared by the war and he wanted to throw her a party. He became Abu Hani's second customer.\nLittle by little, the baker was baking again.\nEvery cake comes with a story\n\"Each person who came in had his own story,\" he says.\nOne evening, as Abu Hani was closing up for the day, a man begged for a cake for his wedding that very night.\n\"It's the night of my life, and I'm living in a tent,\" Abu Hani recalls the groom said. The baker couldn't resist.\nSome customers ask for a take-home bag that's not see-through, so other people in their tent camp won't get jealous of their cake.\n\"Two hours ago,\" the baker says, \"someone called me and said, 'I'm embarrassed to come to the shop. I'm in a shelter. Ever since we passed by your shop, my child has been asking for a cake.'\"\nThe caller couldn't afford a whole cake, and asked if he could buy a smaller one. The baker told him to pay whatever he could.\nAbu Hani handles each cake, and customer, with care.\nFlour from the black market\nDuring the war, supplies in Gaza are low and prices are high. Sugar and eggs cost a fortune — a kilo of sugar has jumped from $1 to $20 in Rafah, and a large crate of eggs that normally sells for $10 can now cost more than $50, he says.\nBatool Cakes now sells its standard \"mini-medium\" cakes for 70 shekels, or nearly $17 — up from its pre-war price of 35 shekels, nearly $10, due to the rising cost of ingredients during the war. Abu Hani is not making a profit on his bakery.\nHe buys black-market flour that belongs to the United Nations, that is meant to be given away as aid. He says he feels bad, but that it's worth it to see the joy in his customers' eyes.\nAbu Hani struggles to find other ingredients. He can't find the cream he used to buy. He has butter cream, but he says people in Gaza don't like it. They prefer lighter cream, so he's trying to recreate it from scratch.\nHe closes the bakery whenever he needs to test a new recipe. He doesn't want to sell something that's not first rate. He says the people of Gaza deserve it.\nEven in their worst desperation, he says, they have standards, and he has standards, too. The war hasn't changed that.\n\"We are not a garbage dump. We are not a place where people will eat just anything,\" Abu Hani says. \"People in Gaza have very refined taste.\"\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

    "title": "ADN dans les vaccins : Les médecins allemands en colère",
    "text": "par CovidHub L’institut de contrôle sanitaire accusé d’avoir caché l’information et trahi sa mission. En Allemagne, la révélation d’importantes quantités d’ADN dans les vaccins a créé la foire d’empoigne dans le monde médical. Début décembre, l’association des praticiens de la médecine (MBV) a adressé un courrier à tous les médecins généralistes pour les avertir de ce danger pour la santé et de ses conséquences légales. L’institut fédéral responsable du contrôle des vaccins a immédiatement démenti ces accusations, parlant de données inexactes et de «fake news». Mais ses arguments ont aussitôt été démontés par un groupe de scientifiques, le MWGFD, qui a confirmé les dangers liés à l’ADN dans les vaccins Covid. L’affaire les a même poussés à porter de lourdes accusations contre l’Institut Paul Ehrlich, qui est responsable de la pharmacovigilance en Allemagne, et qui conseille l’Agence européenne des médicaments. Le «Plasmidgate» La tentative de l’Institut Paul Ehrlich (IPE) de faire passer les informations concernant la présence d’ADN dans les vaccins pour des «fake news» a suscité un véritable tollé et lancé le débat sur la place publique. C’est tout d’abord la chaîne de télévision allemande MDR qui a réalisé un reportage sur le sujet. Peu après, le magazine en ligne Focus a lui aussi publié un dossier sur ce que l’on appelle aujourd’hui «le Plasmidgate». À présent, le scandale prend de l’ampleur, car il apparaît que l’Institut Paul Ehrlich n’a jamais effectué de véritables contrôles des vaccins Covid. Il s’est seulement limité à vérifier les documents fournis par les fabricants. Cet aveu est un véritable choc pour de nombreux médecins et pour le public. Comment imaginer que l’autorité responsable de la sécurité des médicaments donne de facto carte blanche aux fabricants, en se fiant à leurs propres affirmations sur la qualité du produit ? L’association des praticiens de médecine pose aujourd’hui des questions fort embarrassantes : «Qu’est-ce qui pousse l’agence de contrôle à vouloir mettre fin à une action qui contribue à la sécurité des médicaments ? L’IPE part-il du principe que les connaissances sur les impuretés de l’ADN peuvent devenir un problème pour la sécurité des vaccins ? Plusieurs travaux d’analyse ont démontré que les vaccins à ARNm présentent d’importantes contaminations de l’ADN. L’IPE n’est-il pas au courant de ces publications scientifiques ? Des spécialistes avaient pourtant alerté l’agence dès les premières publications des chercheurs américains sur ce sujet. À présent, ils sont maintenant encore plus irrités et alarmés». Collusion avec BioNTech La MVB a aussi souligné que le professeur Cichutek, président de l’Institut Paul Ehrlich, est un des plus grands chercheurs allemands en matière de thérapie génique et qu’il avait lui-même décrit en détail les dangers des thérapies géniques, dans les années 90. Selon ses propres termes, la vaccination avec des vaccins contenant des acides nucléiques équivaut à «une forme particulière de transfert de gènes/thérapie génique». Et, «une conséquence génétique indésirable des vaccinations avec des vaccins contenant des acides nucléiques pourrait être une mutagenèse par insertion de gènes cellulaires… entraînant un risque accru de cancer». Au vu du contenu inquiétant de cette publication du professeur Cichutek datant de 1994, la MBV exige des explications publiques ! Quand, où et comment les risques qu’il a lui-même énumérés ont-ils été étudiés plus en détail ? Jusqu’à présent, l’IPE a refusé de fournir la moindre réponse à ces questions. Selon un ancien directeur de la caisse des assurances-maladies (KVB), le Dr Krimmel, un spécialiste en médecine générale, l’attitude de l’Institut Paul Ehrlich a «aggravé la situation». Elle est «de nature à ôter au public ses dernières illusions quant au bon fonctionnement de la surveillance de la production de vaccins à ARNm». Pourquoi l’Institut ne veut-il pas dissiper ce «terrible soupçon» de contamination massive par de l’ADN ? Que sait l’IPE sur ce sujet, étant donné qu’il avait lui-même conseillé la société productrice BioNtech d’obtenir l’autorisation du vaccin ? En juin 2023, le ministre de la santé allemand a tweeté depuis la salle ‘de contrôle des vaccins’ de l’Institut Paul Ehrlich que «grâce au Prof. Cichutek et à l’IPE les vaccins Covid ont été approuvés plus rapidement» Trompés par les agences La MBV a rappelé qu’il existe deux procédés de fabrication différents pour les vaccins à ARNm, comme l’Agence européenne des médicaments l’a bien mentionné dans son rapport d’évaluation du 19.02.2021 (concernant Comirnaty, EMA/707383/2020, CHMP). «Le produit soumis à l’évaluation des agences sanitaires était un vaccin produit par qPCR. Mais pour [ la production de masse des vaccins Covid](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/impfopfer-wehren-sich-der-biontech-impfstoff-fuer-die-breite-masse-wies-anfangs-erhebliche-maengel-auf_id_259473898.html), on a ensuite utilisé un procédé nettement plus «rapide» en produisant de l’ARNm à partir de plasmides d’ADN». Dans sa lettre initiale aux généralistes, la MBV a aussi accusé l’IPE d’avoir trompé les médecins et les pharmaciens en affirmant que les avantages des vaccins à ARNm Covid-19 l’emportaient nettement sur les risques éventuels. D’innombrables études l’ont prouvé, mais les autorités allemandes persistent dans leur politique de désinformation. «Il est très problématique que l’IPE ne soit pas encore intervenu en lançant ses propres enquêtes pour évaluer la qualité des produits. Mais le fait qu’il s’arroge le droit d’interdire, sans base juridique et de manière totalement inappropriée, une initiative privée visant à remédier à la situation, n’est en aucun cas compréhensible. En fin de compte, l’action de l’Institut de contrôle semble avoir pour seul objectif d’empêcher délibérément les initiatives visant à établir la sécurité des médicaments. L’Institut Paul Ehrlich agit donc manifestement à l’encontre de sa mission légale !» Chaos dans le génome Le Plasmidgate pourrait bien être le coup de grâce à la politique du «tout-vaccin» menée par les autorités sanitaires de différents pays. Plusieurs équipes de chercheurs indépendants ont montré les différentes manières dont le génome est attaqué par les vaccins Covid. En premier lieu, la présence d’ADN contaminant les injections Covid dans des quantités qui dépassent de mille fois les résidus autorisés par l’Agence européenne des médicaments, peut entraîner une modification du génome de la personne injectée. Mais il y a encore d’autres raisons pour lesquelles les injections Covid peuvent avoir des conséquences gravissimes sur la génétique humaine. La protéine Spike codifiée dans les vaccins n’est pas la protéine Spike d’origine, mais une version ayant subi une modification génétique. Ce sont donc d’autres protéines qui sont produites par les vaccinés. Récemment, [une étude italienne](https://www.europeanreview.org/article/34685) a d’ailleurs permis de différencier les protéines Spike naturelles des protéines Spike vaccinales dans le sang des sujets infectés. Une découverte récente est le fait que cette «Spike modifiée» entraîne des erreurs de lecture du génome, avec comme conséquence la production de toute une série de protéines différentes, connues ou inconnues, dont on ignore l’action sur l’organisme. Au stade actuel, «c’est un plongeon dans l’inconnu». Il est pratiquement impossible d’en prédire les effets à court et à long terme et ceux-ci peuvent très bien varier d’une personne vaccinée à l’autre. Conscients du danger que cela représente, scientifiques et médecins sont de plus en plus nombreux à penser que poursuivre l’utilisation de technologies à base d’ARNm s’apparente à de la folie. Tous plaident pour un arrêt immédiat de ces expériences et pour le retrait immédiat des vaccins encore sur le marché. Pour en savoir plus : L’association des praticiens de médecine MBV propose des informations [détaillées de ses actions et courriers sur ce site.](https://corona-impfschaden-hilfe.de/wordpress/2023/12/18/pei/) Les médecins et scientifiques allemands se sont notamment appuyés sur [les publications](https://corona-impfschaden-hilfe.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Speicher-EvaluationoftheDNAcontentinmRNAvaccinevials.pdf) de Jeremie Speicher, [Jessica Rose](https://www.covidhub.ch/csi-2-nov-2023/) et [Maria Gutschi](https://www.covidhub.ch/csi-14-dec-2023/) dont le Conseil scientifique Indépendant a présenté les travaux lors de plusieurs sessions. Aux Pays-Bas, le [Dr Maarten Fornerod et le Prof. Theo Schetters](https://twitter.com/_aussie17/status/1739818207635251444), experts en biologie moléculaire, ont également exigé le retrait immédiat des vaccins à technologie ARN.

    "text": "After a rough two years , snow lovers in New York City finally have something to celebrate.\nThe National Weather Service reported this morning that Central Park had so far recorded a modest yet still exciting 1.4 inches of snow from Monday night’s storm. That finally broke New York City’s record-smashing streak of 701 days without at least an inch of daily snowfall precipitation.\nWe’re bundled up and heading out to visit our neighbors, @NYHistory , @MuseumModernArt , @NYHistory , @metmuseum for a #MuseumSnowballfight . ☃️\nReady for us? pic.twitter.com/kVTAlvqGUA\n— Central Park (@CentralParkNYC) January 16, 2024 The snow was part of a system that recently brought snow to southern states like Tennessee and Texas, according to Accuweather . The precipitation began Monday evening and is expected to continue through Tuesday.\nIt has been awhile but New Yorkers woke up to snow in Central Park, Tuesday morning #newyorkcity #nyc #newyork @centralparknyc #snow pic.twitter.com/5uNliiDMk5\n— Gary Hershorn (@GaryHershorn) January 16, 2024 The NWS has extended its Winter Weather Advisory through 7 p.m., warning that the snow is expected to change to freezing rain and even occasionally sleet as the day continues. Alternate side parking rules are suspended Tuesday in light of the weather. New York City schools are open and will operate as usual.\nIt would all be rather unremarkable in any other year. But in 2024, it counts as a big deal.\n79th Street in #BayRidge #Brooklyn with some snowy streets. #snow #snowfall #NYC @NY1 pic.twitter.com/B1SvM2qDI0\n— Samantha Liebman (@SamiLiebman) January 16, 2024",

    "text": "Gulf Islands Ferry Service set to start Friday! MANATEE COUNTY, Fla. (WWSB) - Service for the Gulf Islands Ferry is officially starting Friday, Jan. 12, 2024, barring any inclement weather. According to officials with Manatee County, the project was on track to start Dec. 8 but the service was still in its final approval stages from outside agencies. Visitors and residents can catch a ride on the water Friday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Ride times between stops will range from 25 to 40 minutes. The two catamarans hold 49 passengers and will have two crew aboard to ensure smooth transportation to and from each port. The initial route of the two 50-foot open-air catamarans, Miss Anna Maria and Downtown Duchess, will take riders from the day dock in downtown Bradenton located just east of the Green Bridge and directly off Bradenton Riverwalk, to the Anna Maria City pier. The Historic City Pier at Bradenton Beach will be added to the route system as soon as some minor enhancements are completed. To learn more, click here. Copyright 2023 WWSB. All rights reserved.",
