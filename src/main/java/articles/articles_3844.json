    "title": "Laverne Cox roasts Republicans for spending $65million on anti-trans adverts when they could’ve bought her “a house in the Hills”",
    "text": "Laverne Cox has called out the Republican party for “going all-in on their transphobia” this election season. You can watch her full speech below.\nREAD MORE: Soundtrack Of My Life: Laverne Cox The 52-year-old actor and activist, who shot to fame after playing trans inmate Sophia on the Netflix drama Orange is the New Black , used her recent appearance on The Daily Show to raise awareness of the disinformation surrounding anti-trans legislation and campaigning.\nDuring the appearance, Cox drew attention to the surge in anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation across the US, including the 25 stats that banned transgender under-18s from accessing gender-affirming care.\n“Thanks for making sure schools don’t teach about sexual orientation or gender identity, because pretending trans kids don’t exist means they disappear, just like pretending climate change doesn’t exist… it disappears too!,” she said, before jokingly adding, “So I guess we will never know why my tits are sweating in December.”\nCox then highlighted that Donald Trump and the Republican part have spent $65 million (£49 million) on campaign ads pushing anti-trans rhetoric.\nHitting back at the ads, Cox said: “Do you know how disappointing it is for someone to finally spend $65 million on me and it’s for this crap? I didn’t want hateful attack ads. I wanted a house in the Hills with six walk-in closets!”\nShe continued: “This is straight out of the bigotry handbook, using dehumanising language on marginalised groups provides a permission structure to attack them, because, when people are rendered no longer human, you can take away their rights, [and] commit violence against them with impunity.”\nCox went on to reference the ongoing legal dispute between North Carolina lieutenant governor Mark Robinson and CNN, which reported in September that the Republican left a series of disturbing comments on a pornography website before entering politics. Robinson, who is taking legal action against the outlet, strongly denied the claims before admitted that he enjoys watching trans pornography.\nCox joked about the situation: “If you had told me anti-trans politicians were secretly watching – and loving – trans porn, I would’ve said, ‘Duh.’\n“I’m 52 years old and if I had a dime for every conservative man who’s tried to get with me, I could buy that house in the Hills.”\nShe added: “Turning us into sex objects is just another way of dehumanising us. And I think it’s time to stop dehumanising and start rehumanising each other.”\nCox then showed a map suggesting that the top searches for trans porn are all in red states, before concluding: “We see you. We see all of you. All we ask is that you see us, too. And that you pull your damn pants up.”\nEarlier this week, Veep star Julia Louis Dreyfus launched her own criticism of Donald Trump and the Republican party over women’s rights in America.\nTaking to social media, the actress said in a video: “They want to reach into our doctors’ offices and our bedrooms to control our access to birth control and IVF and, of course, abortion – even though they wouldn’t know a uterus if they had to crawl out of one for a second time.”\nLouis-Dreyfus went on to urge people to vote for Harris before adding: “Because, I don’t know about you, but I’d really like to get the government out of my fucking snatch.”",

    "text": "Tyron Woodley alleges that Georges St-Pierre turned down a “dumb bag” to fight him: “Eight figures” Former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley has alleged that Georges St-Pierre turned down a massive payday against him. ‘The Chosen One’ hasn’t been seen in combat sports since a sixth-round knockout loss to Jake Paul in the boxing ring in December 2021. Since then, Tyron Woodley has been quiet about a potential return. However, he did show interest in facing ‘The Problem Child’ [in his PFL debut, slated for late 2024](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/tyron-woodley/tyron-woodley-calls-for-pfl-trilogy-bout-with-jake-paul-fighting-anybody-in-mma-outside-of-me-is-disrespect/). However, Tyron Woodley has now expressed interest in fighting [ Georges St-Pierre](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/georges-st-pierre/georges-st-pierre-names-his-favorite-fighters-he-hopes-to-see-in-the-ufcs-2024-superfight/) under his own banner. Speaking in a recent interview with TMZ Sports, the former UFC champion announced the founding of ‘The Realest International Promotion‘. For his first bout, the Missouri native wanted to face ‘Rush’. Sadly, the fight failed to come together. Speaking in the interview, Tyron Woodley alleged that he offered Georges St-Pierre upwards of eight figures to accept the bout, but the legend declined. He also offered the bout to [Nick Diaz](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/nick-diaz/nick-diaz-boxing-entertain/), but the Stockton slugger too, had limited interest. It’s safe to say that Woodley will have to look elsewhere for his promotion’s first event. Whether that means a fight with a Diaz brother or not, it’s clear that Tyron Woodley has big goals for 2024. Sadly for him, it doesn’t sound like Georges St-Pierre will be a part of it. Who the former UFC champion will face in his MMA return next year is far from certain as of now.

Like Georges St-Pierre. I offered him a dumb bag, he said no, ‘I’m not in that world anymore’.” He continued, “I offered Nick Diaz a dumb bag, when I say ‘dumb’, I’m talking about pushing the eight figures. A lot of money, to fight me, in the middle east. But, they both said no. Nick didn’t say no, Nick liked the comment, so I don’t know what that means. But you know what I mean, [I want to fight] people that I respect, people that I thought were GOATS. Now that the money is really coming to the sport, I want to go at those people first.” “To try and get them paid with me, because it’s a partnership.” Tyron Woodley stated, regarding the future of his own MMA company. “Whether I like Jake or not, I was a business partner with him for two fights. This is a business.” What do you make of these comments from Tyron Woodley? Do you want to see him fight Georges St-Pierre in 2024? Or would you rather see ‘Rush’ remain in retirement?

    "title": "Hospitalization linked to higher risk of MRSA infections in households | CIDRAP",
    "text": "A new study suggests that people who've recently been hospitalized could potentially be a major source of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission in households. The study , published yesterday in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, found that household members exposed to a family member recently diagnosed with MRSA were more than 71 times more likely to get a MRSA infection than those who had not been exposed to a family member with MRSA. But the study also found that exposure to recently hospitalized patients with no MRSA diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of MRSA infection, likely because those patients had been colonized with MRSA during their hospital stay. \"Patients can become colonized with MRSA during their hospital stay and transmit MRSA to their household members,\" lead study author Aaron Miller, PhD, an assistant professor of internal medicine-infectious diseases at the University of Iowa, said in a press release from journal publisher the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). \"This suggests hospitals contribute to the spread of MRSA into the community through discharged patients who are asymptomatic carriers.\" Hospitalization increases risk of household transmission by 44% MRSA has long been a common cause of healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals, particularly in patients who've had surgeries or have indwelling devices. It can cause skin infections and more severe invasive infections. There are also community-associated strains of MRSA that cause skin infections in otherwise healthy people and can easily be transmitted in crowded settings and households through skin-to-skin contact. Some people carry MRSA on their skin without ever becoming infected. To determine the extent to which recent MRSA diagnosis and hospitalization might increase the risk of MRSA transmission in households, Miller and his colleagues extracted patient data from a large commercial insurance database from 2001 through 2021, limiting the population to households with two or more family members on the same insurance plan. They then identified cases of MRSA in both inpatient and outpatient settings and compared the monthly incidence of MRSA between individuals in households where another member had been diagnosed with MRSA in an inpatient or outpatient setting within the last 30 days, and individuals in households with no recent MRSA exposure. In a second analysis, they looked at MRSA incidence in households where a family member had recently been hospitalized but not diagnosed with MRSA. Patients can become colonized with MRSA during their hospital stay and transmit MRSA to their household members. Among the more than 157 million enrollees included in the study, the researchers identified 424,512 MRSA cases in 343,524 individuals. Of the MRSA cases identified, 4,724 (1.1%) represented a possible transmission linked to a recent MRSA diagnosis in a separate family member, and 8,064 (1.9%) represented possible transmission after recent hospitalization of a separate family member. A stratified regression analysis found that the estimated incidence rate of MRSA among those exposed to a family member with a MRSA diagnosis was more than 71 times the rate compared with those not exposed to a family member with MRSA (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 71.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 67.73 to 74.50). Among those individuals who had a family member who was recently hospitalized but not diagnosed with MRSA, the IRR of MRSA was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.49). \"This relatively smaller estimate is consistent with our understanding that only a portion of hospitalized patients are colonized with MRSA at discharge,\" Miller and his co-authors wrote. But they add that with 25 million Americans having overnight hospital stays annually, patients who come home colonized with MRSA could represent a \"potentially major source\" of MRSA infections in household members. Findings highlight importance of hospital infection practices The analysis also found that the risk of MRSA among household members increased the longer the recently hospitalized family member was in the hospital. The IRR increased from 1.34 (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.40) when a family member was hospitalized for 1 to 3 days to 1.49 (95% CI, 1.41 to 1.57) when hospitalization lasted 4 to 10 days. Other factors associated with MRSA infection in household members included the number of comorbidities, prior antibiotic usage, and having young children in the family. The authors note that the findings are limited by the inability to determine exact exposure status among family members and the lack of sequencing data to study potential transmission events. Miller added that it's important not to over-emphasize the risk, since the overall number of MRSA cases identified was low. But SHEA president Thomas Talbot, MD, who was not involved in the research, said the link found between hospitalization and household MRSA transmission highlights why hospital infection prevention and control practices are so important. \"Hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and standard interventions to reduce Staphylococcal colonization are crucial to preventing the spread of resistant bacteria in healthcare settings,\" he said.",

    "text": "Music festival Electric Picnic has announced the main stage at the festival will be connected to the grid and powered by renewable energy in 2024. This marks the first time a festival of its kind in the UK and Ireland will install mains power to reduce its carbon footprint. The grid power will ultimately reduce carbon emissions associated with powering the main stage of the festival in 2024 and reduce the need to use temporary generators. Festival Republic will submit a planning application for a substation and if successful, work will begin later this year on delivering grid power to the main stage which will mark the transition of the outdoor live sector to renewable power. The goal is to inspire other festivals to assess the feasibility of connecting their event to the national grid, as this is a long-term sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions at festivals. Melvin Benn, Managing Director Festival Republic said: \"‘The installation of our first grid connection is a key contributor to our goal of reducing carbon emissions associated with the festival by 50 per cent by 2030 in line with our Green Nation Charter. I hope that by leading the way and sharing what we have learned, festival goers can have an amazing time at Electric Picnic safe in the knowledge that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact on the only planet we have got.”",
