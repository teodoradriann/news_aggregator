    "text": "<a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/02/01/censure-back-and-forth-continues-in-the-house-greene-omar/\">\nPublic shaming attempts continue in House as Greene takes aim at Omar\n</a>\nCensures are on the rise this Congress, and Marjorie Taylor Greene is trying for another one\nAfter a year that saw three censures and an expulsion, the House seems ready to pick up where it left off, as members launch more attempts to punish their colleagues.\nThe latest effort comes from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is taking aim at Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar over disputed remarks she made to a group of Somali Americans.\nGreene, the Georgia Republican who in the past has\nspoken at a conference of white nationalists, says she wishes she could “deport” her colleague but would settle for a censure instead. She is forcing action by offering a privileged resolution that would censure Omar for what she describes as “treasonous statements.” The House must act on the resolution next week.\n“I urge my colleagues to vote to censure, but I wish I had the votes to expel and deport her,” Greene\nwrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nVideo of Omar giving a speech in the Somali language at a recent Minneapolis event has circulated widely on social media, alongside a translation that critics have seized on to paint her as anti-American. “I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside the U.S. system,” that translation reads in part.\nOmar has dismissed that as “\ncompletely off,” circulated a different translation of her remarks and fired back at Republicans. “They were an easy mark, lol,” she wrote on X in response to a post that said, “An African breakaway state succeeded in psyoping American conservatives.”\nAt the event, Omar was addressing the crowd about Ethiopia’s recent announcement that it would aid Somaliland, a breakaway state not recognized by the international community, in exchange for access to the sea. When the video initially went viral, it was\nposted by someone identifying themselves as an official from Somaliland.\nSomalis argue the agreement is a threat to their sovereignty, and\ntensions have simmered in the region.\nIn her speech, Omar told the crowd she would always support a unified Somalia, according to an independent translation\ncommissioned by the Minnesota Reformer. “As long as I am in Congress, no one will take over the seas belonging to the nation of Somalia,” she said, according to that translation.\nStill, Republicans have\npiled on Omar in the days since the video surfaced.\n“Ilhan Omar’s appalling, Somalia-first comments are a slap in the face to the Minnesotans she was elected to serve and a direct violation of her oath of office. She should resign in disgrace,”\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer wrote on X on Monday.\nOn Wednesday, Emmer called for an ethics investigation into Omar in a letter sent to House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest, R-Texas, and ranking member Susan Wild, D-Pa.\nAnd Greene’s resolution calls not only for Omar’s censure but also for her removal from the Budget Committee and the Education and the Workforce Committee.\nOmar was removed in 2023 from the Foreign Affairs Committee for making remarks seen as antisemitic. She had previously apologized for using “ antisemitic tropes” to describe the influence of pro-Israel lobbying groups.\nThe first Somali American and the first African refugee in Congress, Omar is also one of the first two Muslim women to serve. The other is Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who has also earned the ire of Greene.\nLast year, Greene launched an effort to censure Tlaib over comments she made about the Israel-Hamas war. In a statement at the time, Tlaib accused Greene’s resolution of being “\ndeeply Islamophobic.”\nA different effort to censure Tlaib ultimately\nsucceeded in the House, making her one of three members last year to receive the punishment, along with Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Adam B. Schiff of California.\nCensure was\nformerly rare in the House and amounts to a public shaming. Censured members are often required to present themselves in the well of the chamber as the resolution is read. (A more concrete punishment is to expel a member from Congress altogether, as lawmakers did to New York Republican George Santos last year.)\nPrior to the trio of Democrats rebuked in 2023, only two members of the House had been\ncensured in all of the 21st century.\nThis Congress has seen an uptick in censure attempts as members engage in a bitter back-and-forth tied to larger partisan battles. Earlier this year, for example, New York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman\nintroduced a resolution calling for the censure of Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik for referring to rioters facing criminal charges for their involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack as “hostages.”\nMembers on both sides of the aisle have\naired their frustration about the recent trend of introducing censures as privileged resolutions, as Greene did this week. The procedural tool allows any member of the House to essentially sidestep leadership and force action on the floor within two legislative days.\n“These privileged resolutions, to censure and to impeach, it’s such a colossal waste of time,” House Rules ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said in December. “These people aren’t interested in governing, they’re interested in distraction.”",

    "text": "[Europe](../)\nDivide between longer life and years of good health ‘getting wider’\nThere’s a growing gap between our healthspan and our lifespan, a new international study showed.\nThe gap between our healthspan – the years lived in good health – and lifespan is widening, according to a new international study.\nThe research, which was published [in the journal JAMA Network Open](//jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827753), was conducted in 183 countries using data collected over two decades by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nAccording to the data, global life expectancy increased by 6.5 years over the 20 years.\nHowever, this increase “was not matched by an equivalent increase in healthspan,” the researchers indicated.\n“The data show that gains in longevity are not matched with equivalent advances in healthy longevity. Growing older often means more years of life burdened with disease,” Dr Andre Terzic, a study’s senior author and a member of the US-based Mayo Clinic, [said in a statement](//www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1067937).\n“This research has important practice and policy implications by bringing attention to a growing threat to the quality of longevity and the need to close the healthspan-lifespan gap,” he added.\nThe gap between healthspan and lifespan was 9.6 years in 2019, the last year where data was available, climbing from 8.5 years in 2000, a 13 per cent increase over the past two decades.\nThe largest gaps were observed in the United States (12.4 years), Australia (12.1 years), New Zealand (11.8 years), the UK (11.3 years), and Norway (11.2 years).\nMental health, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal conditions were the primary factors accelerating the gap observed in the US.\nLesotho (6.5 years), Central African Republic (6.7 years), Somalia (6.8 years), Kirbati (6.8 years), and Micronesia (7.0 years) had the smallest gaps.\nGendered differences on the healthspan-lifespan gap\n“The widening healthspan-lifespan gap globally points to the need for an accelerated pivot to proactive wellness-centric care systems,” Armin Garmany, first author and an MD/PhD student at the Mayo Clinic, said.\n“Identifying contributors to the gap unique to each geography can help inform healthcare interventions specific to each country and region”.\n“Globally, a mean difference of 2.4 years between women and men in the healthspan-lifespan gap was observed,” the study authors wrote.\nThe largest sex disparities in the gap were in Germany (3.6 years), Spain (3.4 years), France (3.3 years), Portugal (3.2 years), and Lebanon (3.2 years).\nNeurological, musculoskeletal, urinary, and genital tract disorders were significant factors that contributed to this difference.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//www.euronews.com/health/2024/12/19/the-gap-between-years-lived-in-good-health-and-how-long-we-live-is-getting-wider)",

    "text": "Being the most powerful Generative AI doesn’t generally mean that they are safe in protecting sensitive data. Their guardrails are not foolproof, cybersecurity experts say. ChatGPT 5, the most powerful LLM upgrade from OpenAI, seems to be no exception. This creates a significant danger for organisations where these tools are being rapidly adopted by employees, often without oversight.\nJust 24 hours after OpenAI launched its highly anticipated GPT-5 model, which is supposed to offer sophisticated prompt safety, exposure management company Tenable has claimed that it successfully jailbroke the platform. It stated that the GenAI engine provided detailed instructions on how to build a Molotov cocktail, a handheld weapon studded with inflammable substances.\nTenable said that its researchers used a social engineering method known as the crescendo technique to bypass these safety protocols in just four simple prompts by posing as a history student interested in the historical context and recipe of the incendiary device.\n“The successful jailbreak highlights a critical security gap in the latest generation of AI models, demonstrating that despite developer claims, they remain vulnerable to manipulation for malicious purposes,” Tomer Avni, Vice-President (Product Management) at Tenable, said.\n“The ease with which we bypassed GPT-5’s new safety protocols proves that even the most advanced AI is not foolproof,” he said.\nWithout proper visibility and governance, businesses are unknowingly exposed to serious security, ethical, and compliance risks. This incident is a clear call for a dedicated AI exposure management strategy to secure every model in use.\nThese jailbreaks prove that organisations cannot rely solely on the built-in safety features offered by the LLMs.\nA similar jailbreak was reported by the Unit 42 research team of Palo Alto Networks. The research team jailbroke the open-source reasoning model DeepSeek recently.\nSwapna Bapat, Vice-President and Managing Director (India and SAARC) of Palo Alto Networks, said that the team used multiple techniques to bypass its built-in safeguards. While initial responses often appeared benign, carefully crafted follow-up prompts elicited detailed malicious outputs, ranging from phishing kits to attack instructions for techniques such as SQL injection and lateral movement.\nUnit 42 researchers used two tested jailbreaking techniques (Deceptive Delight and Bad Likert Judge) and a new method called Crescendo against DeepSeek models. “We achieved significant bypass rates, with little to no specialised knowledge or expertise being necessary,” the team said.\n“Our research findings show that these jailbreak methods can elicit explicit guidance for malicious activities. These activities include data exfiltration tooling, keylogger creation and even instructions for incendiary devices, demonstrating the tangible security risks posed by this emerging class of attack,” it said.\nWhile it can be challenging to guarantee complete protection against all jailbreaking techniques for a specific LLM, organisations can implement security measures that can help monitor when and how employees are using LLMs. This becomes crucial when employees are using unauthorised third-party LLMs, a cybersecurity expert said.\nPublished on August 14, 2025\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.
