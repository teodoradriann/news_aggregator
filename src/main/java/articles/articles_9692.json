    "text": "Lady Braves Lose Road Battle to Grambling State, 82-69\nThe Alcorn State Lady Braves fell 82-69 to Grambling State in a SWAC basketball matchup. A strong performance from Destiny Brown, who scored 17 points, wasn't enough to overcome Grambling's offensive efficiency, as they maintained their lead throughout the game. The Lady Braves' bench contribution was significant, scoring 42 points, while they struggled with turnovers despite forcing 23 from their opponents.\n- 17 – Destiny Brown's leading score with 17 points and six rebounds.\n- 14 – Kailyn Watkins added 14 points with four three-pointers.\n- 42 – Points contributed by Alcorn's bench.\n- 23 – Turnovers forced by the Lady Braves, but were outscored 17-12 in points off those turnovers.\nDespite a strong start and solid contributions from key players, Alcorn failed to maintain offensive momentum and control the game defensively. Grambling’s ability to capitalize on turnovers and maintain shooting accuracy proved decisive.\nState of Play- Alcorn State now holds a 5-14 record and 3-5 in SWAC play.\n- The team struggled with consistency in shooting, particularly in the second quarter.\nThe Lady Braves will face Southern University next, looking to improve their standing in the SWAC with a critical game scheduled for Saturday, February 1.\nBottom LineAlcorn's ability to compete hinges on their defensive strategy and consistency in offensive execution. Improved management of turnovers will be crucial for future games, especially as they look to bounce back against Southern University.\nRead more at Alcorn State University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "'A Backdoor Way...': Why Elon Musk Is Condemning Australia's Social Media Ban For Kids",
    "text": "Billionaire businessman Elon Musk condemned Australia for its recent proposed law to ban social media access for children under 16. The owner of the microblogging platform X called it a \\\"backdoor way to control access to the internet' by all Australians. The said law was announced on X (Musk-owned social media platform) by the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, triggering mixed opinions globally. Alanese in his post, wrote: \\\"We're introducing our bill to make 16 years the minimum age for social media.\\\" The bill was introduced in the parliament by the centre-left government, intending to implement an age-verification system to create one of the strictest social media regulations globally. The government also stated that the companies, if found violating the law or traced in the systematic breach of the law, could face a penalty of up to A$49.5 million (USD 32 million). The bill aims to restrict children's social media use, disallowing exceptions for parental consent or existing accounts. \\\"This legislation underscores our commitment to protecting children's safety and well-being online,\\\" the government stated. Similar measures have been proposed or implemented globally. In 2022, France suggested a social media ban for minors under 15 but included provisions for parental consent. In the US, existing laws mandate tech companies to obtain parental consent before accessing data of children under 13. Elon Musk’s remarks highlight his ongoing tensions with Australia's Labor government over social media regulations. In April, X challenged an Australian cyber regulator’s directive to remove posts about a stabbing incident, prompting Prime Minister Albanese to brand Musk an \\\"arrogant billionaire.\\\" Musk also criticised the government’s misinformation law, calling its approach \\\"fascist.\\\" Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News, World and around the world.",

    "text": "The life of Erika Yanira Morales, a 20 -year -old girl from Pasto, Nariño, took a drastic turn after a violent attack in a disco in 2021. With only 17 years, two women hit her in the head with a bottle, causing her a heart attack Multiple brain that left it quadriplegic. Since then, his health has worsened and has expressed his desire to access euthanasia, arguing that his suffering is unbearable.\nHis sister, Tatiana Morales, has reported through social networks the drama that the family has lived. “From the first diagnosis, doctors told us there was no hope of recovery,” he explained in a Live on Facebook. Despite the efforts to give you medical care and improve your quality of life, Erika has several times her desire to end her pain in a dignified way.\nYou can see: the tragic murder of former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear and her husband: only her 5 -year -old daughter survived the attack\nYoung Colombaian asks Euthanasia: The medical and economic difficulties of her family Since Erika was quadriplegic, her mother assumed not only her care, but also the family’s economic burdens. The young woman needs permanent assistance, medical equipment, specialized nurses, supplies such as diapers and creams, as well as a room adapted for her condition. However, his family has denounced failures in the health service, particularly with the IPS in charge of his current care.\nTatiana Morales said that the new IPS has been poor in the provision of the service. “The medical staff who attends it only goes 10 times a month, when you should receive daily attention,” he said. In addition, Erika has suffered complications such as pressure ulcers and accelerated weight loss, which has aggravated her state of health.\nDespite your family’s efforts to guarantee adequate attention, lack of resources and difficult access to a specialized medical team have further complicated the situation. “What my sister needs most is not money, but a trained medical team that gives her the attention she requires,” Tatiana insisted.\nYou can see: “You are already with mom and brothers, you left me alone”: the emotional farewell of Viola Dorantes to her sister, paquita the neighborhood\nThe struggle for decent death: the application of euthanasia Given the constant deterioration of his state of health, Erika Morales made the difficult decision to request euthanasia. In a letter addressed to his family, he expressed his exhaustion: “Virtually alive for mechanical breathing, I am tired of depending on everyone.”\nHowever, his request was rejected by EPS EMSSANAR, under the argument that it was his mother who made the request and not the patient directly. According to the regulations in force in Colombia, the procedure must be requested freely and informed by the interested person, which has generated an additional obstacle to Erika and his family.\nEuthanasia in Colombia is regulated by the Ministry of Justice, which establishes that only adults with a serious or incurable illness, which causes them intense physical or psychic suffering, can access the procedure. Despite his condition, Erika faces bureaucratic obstacles that prevent her from exercising her right to die with dignity\nYou can see: under 2 years old was found after more than a month was missing: her mother was killed in Bogotá, Colombia\nThe emotional impact on the family and the lack of answers The case of Erika Morales has left a deep mark on her family. His sister Tatiana has admitted that accepting her decision has been a difficult process. “For me it is very hard because I am not prepared for my sister to split (…), but I already accepted it, I don’t want to see her suffer anymore,” he confessed.\nFor its part, Erika’s mother is still in charge of her care, while fighting to find solutions to the lack of support of the EPS and the medical complications facing her daughter. “The attention it receives is minimal and not enough,” he denounced.\nThe case has opened again the debate on failures in the health system in Colombia, especially with regard to the rights of patients with chronic diseases and severe disabilities. The family expects their history to motivate the authorities to improve health services and guarantee real access to dignified death.",

    "text": "Amazon is partnering with a hydrogen company to produce hydrogen fuel.Plug Power Inc. has completed the installation and commissioning of an electrolyzer system at an Amazon fulfillment center in Aurora, Col. The one-megawatt (MW) proton exchange membrane electrolyzer — the first installed and in use at an Amazon site — is producing low-carbon hydrogen to fuel more than 225 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks at the site.The Plug 1MW electrolyzer, which uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen, is able to support up to 400 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks. The hydrogen produced by the electrolyzer will be compressed on site and stored in a gaseous hydrogen storage tank for use by the forklift trucks.To date, Plug has collaborated with Amazon to deploy more than 17,000 fuel cells to replace batteries in forklifts in more than 80 fulfillment centers in North America. For most of these locations, the hydrogen to power the forklifts is produced elsewhere, liquified, and then delivered by trucks to an on-site storage and dispensing system.“Hydrogen is an important tool in our efforts to decarbonize our operations by 2040 in support of The Climate Pledge, and we’re excited about our ability to produce hydrogen at Amazon facilities through this partnership with Plug,” said Asad Jafry, the director of global hydrogen economy at Amazon. “On-site production will make the use of hydrogen even more energy efficient for certain locations and types of facilities.”For the project, Plug provided design, installation, commissioning, and maintenance services for the 1MW PEM electrolyzer and hydrogen storage—compatible with the existing refueling infrastructure and fuel cells already in use at the site.“In Amazon, we have a true partner that recognizes the essential role hydrogen plays in our collective energy future,” said Plug CEO Andy Marsh.",

    "text": "Attorney Wendy Diaz Discusses the Inherent Value: of Safeguarding Corporate Identity through Trademark Registration Attorney Hancel Wendy Diaz Discusses the Inherent Value: of Safeguarding Corporate Identity through Trademark Registration Listed with one of the best Criminal Lawyers in the entire Dominican Republic, director of the litigation department of WDA INTERNATIONAL LAW FIRM”SANTO DOMINGO, REPúBLICA DOMINICANA, December 29, 2023 / — Francisco Manuel Lazala [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- Introduction In the vast universe of commercial and business relationships, a company's identity stands as an invaluable asset. This intangible element, transcending mere materiality, encapsulates the very essence of the brand, a unique entity that not only speaks to the product or service but also whispers the singular narrative of the company offering it. Attorney Wendy Diaz explains: \"In this juridical treatise, we will delve into the sacred realm of trademark registration, a legal mechanism that endows corporate identity with a protective shield, ensuring its integrity in the tumultuous market seas\". Corporate Identity as an Intangible Heritage A company's identity, composed of its values, reputation, and implicit promises, constitutes an immeasurable intangible heritage. This intangible treasure, forged over time, translates into consumer preference, customer loyalty, and ultimately, the financial health of the company. Preserving this identity becomes a monumental task, and this is where trademark registration emerges as the legal bastion that safeguards the corporate soul. The Brand as a Symbol of Distinction and Authenticity At the heart of the brand concept lies its unique ability to be a symbol of distinction and authenticity. The brand, in its graphical, verbal, or mixed manifestation, becomes the recognizable face of a company. It is more than just a name or logo; it is an implicit pact with the consumer, a promise of quality, consistency, and reliability. By registering a trademark, the company not only protects its image but also ensures that its identity is not diluted or usurped in the competitive tumult. Trademark Registration as a Guarantor of Exclusivity In the legal realm, trademark registration confers an exclusive right to the company regarding its distinctive elements. With a practice of more than 25 years in the field of [Trademark Law](https://wdalaw.com/trademark-registration.php), Attorney Wendy Diaz confirms that \"This temporary monopoly, far from being an arbitrary barrier, is the cornerstone that supports fair competition and fosters innovation; therefore, the temporary monopoly granted by trademark registration is essentially a reward for the creativity and effort invested in building a unique corporate identity. It is a safeguard against unfair opportunism and the dilution of uniqueness\". The Financial Value of a Registered Trademark In accordance with the provisions of Trademark Law, a registered trademark not only protects identity but also imparts tangible financial value to the company. In the accounting balance, a registered trademark becomes an asset that can be valued and, at times, capitalized. The trust inspired by a registered trademark can translate into higher profit margins, market expansion, and ultimately, a stronger position in the business landscape. This financial value, imbued with the legal solidity of registration, not only strengthens the company's position in the present but also projects it toward a future of stability and growth. The Trademark Registration Process: A Solemn Juridical Ritual The act of registering a trademark, although it may seem like a bureaucratic procedure, is a solemnly significant juridical ritual. It involves a careful selection of distinctive elements, navigating the hurdles of trademark law, and presenting compelling arguments to the competent authorities. Trademark registration is not just a means to an end; it is a commitment to the protection and preservation of corporate identity. Each trademark registration application is an implicit pledge to safeguard the integrity and uniqueness of the brand. International Protection of Trademarks: A Global Challenge In the era of globalization, trademark protection extends beyond national borders. International agreements, such as the Madrid Protocol and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), establish mechanisms for extending trademark protection globally. While this phenomenon provides opportunities for expansion, it also poses challenges, as it involves harmonizing protection strategies in different legal and cultural contexts. Challenges of Maintaining Exclusivity Trademark registration grants exclusive rights, but these must be defended and maintained with vigilance. Constant market surveillance and prompt responses to potential infringements are critical aspects of preserving exclusivity. Legal actions, such as oppositions and appeals, become essential tools in safeguarding corporate identity in a dynamic and competitive environment. The Social Responsibility of Registered Trademarks Beyond legal protection, registered trademarks assume a social responsibility. The trust placed by consumers not only implies delivering quality products or services but also ethical and socially responsible behavior by the company. Registered trademarks, as guardians of identity, are called to be positive agents in society, contributing to collective well-being and sustainability. Conclusion: Trademark Registration as a Juridical Testament of Corporate Identity In the intricate fabric of trademark law, trademark registration stands as a juridical testament to corporate identity. It is the act that elevates the brand from a mere symbol to a right recognized and protected by the law. In this juridical act, the company proclaims its commitment not only to fair competition but also to the preservation of its uniqueness and contribution to the social and economic fabric in which it is embedded. The inherent value of a registered trademark not only lies in its exclusivity but also in the responsibility it entails, in the power to positively influence society, and in the juridical legacy it leaves as a guiding beacon in the vast ocean of the global market.

Mark Sanford announced the formation of a high-level state climate commission, with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the state.\n“Climate change is real,” Sanford told The State newspaper at the time. “We’re looking at this as an opportunity to lead.”\nBut according to commission member and Coastal Conservation League founder Dana Beach, the effort fizzled after a promising start.\n“We met for about a year, and the group came up with strategies that were very well thought out,” Beach said. “But at the last minute, Sanford decided it was too controversial and then nothing happened.”\nThe second major lost mitigation opportunity was the spectacular collapse of the V.C. Summer nuclear project in 2017, which ultimately led to prison sentences for top utility executives, including then-SCANA CEO Kevin Marsh, and wound up costing ratepayers $9 billion. With a B. Had the project been completed, it would have added 2,200 megawatts of energy to the S.C. grid with zero greenhouse gas emissions. That’s enough to provide reliable power for about a million homes, which is necessary in a state growing by bounding leaps.\n“We’re in such a crisis with climate and carbon, we need to pick our poison,” Beach said of the environmental controversies surrounding nuclear power generation. “But that [project] would have been a mammoth step forward … and we failed to do it because SCANA’s top management was inept and secretive and deceitful.”\nBut environmentalists also say South Carolina has gotten a couple of things right on the mitigation front, even if unintentionally.\nFirst, the state’s existing nuclear infrastructure, built without climate in mind, is unusually robust, providing more than 50% of the state’s power generation. That’s the third-highest level in the nation.\nThe second major positive on mitigation has been South Carolina’s emergence as a national leader in land conservation with more than 3 million acres — or more than 15% of the state’s total land — under protection. And S.C. Gov. Henry McMaster has committed to doubling that number to 6 million acres by 2050.\n“The single most important mitigation strategy we’ve adopted in this state is forest conservation and restoration,” Beach said. “Every day, we sequester thousands of tons of carbon in the growing forests.”\nA ‘regional leader’ Despite the state’s struggles on the mitigation side, climate experts say South Carolina has become a regional leader on climate adaptation — an effort that began in earnest after Hurricane Florence ripped through the state in 2018, causing more than $2 billion in damage.\nAs a result of those efforts, the S.C. Office of Resilience was created in 2020 to identify the state’s major climate vulnerabilities and assets. As its first major project, the new office began collecting data for a statewide resilience and risk reduction plan that was completed and published in 2023.\n“The Resilience Plan is intended to serve as a framework to guide state investment in flood mitigation projects and the adoption of programs and policies to protect the people and property of South Carolina from the damage and destruction of extreme weather events,” SCOR spokesperson Hope Warren said in a statement.\nThe report contains a total of 54 recommendations for climate adaptation programs, policies and projects.\nCampaigne “What we appreciate about the plan is that it’s giving specific recommendations for funding programs, creating policies and better equipping our state and communities to prepare and adapt,” said Alys Campaigne, climate initiative leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Having this framework is critical to creating needed coordination across agencies and communities to adapt and respond.”\nAlready, environmentalists say, the plan is having an impact across the state, with new rules requiring homeowners to disclose previous flooding incidents to prospective buyers, and local government projects such as Columbia’s municipal solar and smart surfaces initiatives.\nMoreover, data collected by the resilience office has begun to unlock federal dollars for critical state adaptation projects.\nSpecifically, climate activists point to the $3 million South Carolina received in 2023 to begin work on a climate pollution reduction plan, which is expected to be finalized in 2027. They also note the recently-announced $421 million Environmental Protection Agency grant that the state will share with Virginia and North Carolina to restore coastal land, improve water quality, and reduce environmental risks.\nNevertheless, climate experts say that these adaptation efforts are insufficient without major action on greenhouse gas reductions.\n“We need to be doing much more to deliver clean energy and clean transportation options that would ultimately be the most important factors in keeping us out of harm’s way and reducing risk,” Campaigne said.\nThe S.C. General Assembly is expected to take up a new energy bill in January. Climate activists are vowing once again to stop any effort to fast-track a large-scale new natural gas plant in rural Colleton County — and to fight for a more market-oriented energy policy that treats all sources, including renewables, equally\nRelated",
