    "text": "Muere Beandri Booysen, la tiktoker de 19 años que luchaba contra una rara enfermedad genética\nHace dos meses, la joven fue sometida a una cirugía a corazón abierto.\nLa tiktoker Beandri Booysen, que padecía una rara enfermedad genética e incurable que la hacía envejecer ocho años por cada año, murió a los 19 años.\nBeandri, de Sudáfrica, nació con el trastorno progresivo síndrome de progeria de Hutchinson-Gilford combinado con osteoporosis, que hace que los huesos se vuelvan frágiles y se rompan.\nSe esperaba que la influencer solo viviera hasta los 14 años, pero luchó por su vida y se volvió una sensación en redes sociales con más de más de 269 mil seguidores.\nHace dos meses, la joven fue sometida a una cirugía a corazón abierto.\nSegún Daily Mail, uno de cada 4 millones de bebés nace con este defecto incurable y Beandri fue sólo uno de los 200 pacientes conocidos en el mundo y el último paciente en Sudáfrica en morir por esta enfermedad.\n\"A pesar de los desafíos con los que tenía que lidiar, Beandri irradiaba esperanza y alegría de la vida. Ella era una voz y un símbolo de conciencia de Progeria y otras necesidades especiales, e inspiró a miles de personas con su espíritu único\", comunicaron sus padres a través de Facebook.\nY añadieron: \"La familia Booysen solicita amablemente privacidad durante este momento extremadamente difícil mientras procesan la pérdida de su querido Beandri. Más detalles sobre el funeral se compartirán más tarde\".\nBeandri pesaba 12 kilos, iba a la escuela y soñaba con casarse cuando tuviera 25 años, tener gemelos y ser maestra.\nBeandri fue amiga de Ontlametse Phalatse, la única persona sudafricana de raza negra con la condición, quien falleció el año pasado a los 18 años.\nActualmente Tiffany Wedekind, de 45 años, de Ohio, EE. UU., es la persona viva de mayor edad con esta enfermedad.",

The downpour threw normal life out of gear in the Someshwar area of Almora district, too, where debris entered several houses. The Almora-Kausani highway that connects Almora with Bageshwar district also got blocked due to the accumulation of slush brought by sudden rainfall. A similar situation was witnessed in Uttarkashi’s Purola region where the sudden downpour caused a flashflood-like situation in Kumola and Hudoli streams, causing the water level to rise quickly and alarming residents of nearby areas. As a precautionary measure, the district administration temporarily halted vehicle movement over the Hudoli stream until the water receded. Devendra Patwal, the area’s district disaster management officer, confirmed that despite the swelling of streams, there was no loss of life or property. However, locals living close to these water bodies have been warned to remain vigilant due to the weather conditions. As per the Met office, Kapkot received 45 mm rain, Garud 40 mm, and Bageshwar city 36 mm. In Uttarkashi district, Chinyalisaur received 15 mm rain, followed by 10 mm in Mori area of the district. Significantly, the Met centre has issued a yellow alert of rain, thunderstorm and lightning activities across the state till May 13.

    "text": "A bill signed by Virginia Gov. [Glenn Youngkin](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/glenn-youngkin/) today aims to combat the [fentanyl crisis](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/fentanyl/) which claims approximately five lives per day in the Commonwealth. [SB 469](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&typ=bil&val=sb469) upgrades charges associated with fentanyl which could lead to harsher sentences for those involved in controlled substances including fentanyl. The bill, introduced by Sen. Mark Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg) passed overwhelmingly in the [Virginia General Assembly](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/virginia-general-assembly/) with bipartisan support. “By signing this legislation, we are more resolved, more emboldened, more unified and more focused than ever before to ensure no more Virginians die as a result of this fentanyl epidemic,” said Gov. Youngkin. “We are sending a powerful message that Virginia will take critical action against the production and distribution of this horrible poison and we will not tolerate the devastation wrought by this deadly substance.” Attorney General [Jason Miyares](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/jason-miyares/) said the bills provides law enforcement the tools it needs to hold drug dealers accountable. “The rise of counterfeit drugs and synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, continue to fuel the drug epidemic gripping the nation right now, but Virginia is fighting back, said Miyares. “By enhancing penalties and criminalizing the possession and use of machines to produce counterfeit drugs, we are supplying law enforcement personnel with the tools they need to hold drug dealers accountable for poisoning our communities.” Obenshain said that tragically, almost every person in Virginia has a close connection to someone who has died of a drug overdose, fentanyl in particular. “The [Virginia Department of Health](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/virginia-department-of-health/) reports that almost 79 percent of drug overdose deaths in our Commonwealth are due to fentanyl. This is unacceptable,” said Sen. Obenshain. “This new law provides three avenues to get at those who are manufacturing and altering these drugs for sale. It’s going to help protect our children and save their lives.” Breaking down SB469 Controlled substances; manufacturing, selling, giving, distributing, etc.; adulterated or misbranded drugs; penalties. - Makes it a Class 6 felony for any person, except for permitted manufacturers, to possess, purchase, sell, give, distribute, or possess with intent to sell, give, or distribute an encapsulating machine or a tableting machine that manufactures, compounds, converts, produces, processes, prepares, or otherwise introduces into the human body a controlled substance. - Makes it a Class 5 felony if such person knows, intends, or has reasonable cause to believe that such action will result in the unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance or counterfeit controlled substance that contains (i) a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or Schedule II of the Drug Control Act or (ii) a controlled substance analog as defined in relevant law. - Makes it a felony punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 40 years for any person 18 years of age or older to knowingly allow a minor or a mentally incapacitated or physically helpless person of any age to be present during the manufacture or attempted manufacture of any substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl. - The bill also increases from a Class 2 misdemeanor to a Class 6 felony the penalty for violations related to adulterated or misbranded drugs and cosmetics.
