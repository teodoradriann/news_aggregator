    "text": "春植绿意正当时。作为我国治理荒漠化的主战场、防御沙尘暴的主防线， 内蒙古担负着国家“三北”工程六期沙化土地治理60％的任务量。 连日来，内蒙古各地开展植树造林，推进大规模国土绿化工作。\n　　科技治沙 探索生态治理新路径\n　　 启用空中运输设备 提高运输效率\n　　在鄂尔多斯市鄂托克旗5万亩乌大沙蒙宁联防联治项目治沙现场，操作人员操控2台无人机吊运着沙柳枝条，沿着预设路线飞行。抵达指定区域后，在工作人员的配合下，迅速投放沙柳枝条。\n　　\n　　这架大型燃油无人机悬吊着稻草，飞至10公里外的治沙目标区域后，精准投放草料。这些空中运输设备的使用，不仅有效解决了治沙现场的运输难题，还提高了运输效率。\n　　 机器人+种植车 精准种植高效完成\n　　在治沙现场，无人植树机器人和半自动种植车，成为“治沙利器”。\n　　\n　　无人植树机器人在沙地里稳健前行，精准扦插着1米长的沙柳枝条。开沟、植苗、覆土一气呵成，仅仅19分钟，一亩地的沙柳种植任务就顺利完成。\n　　 巧用可降解容器 提高幼苗成活率\n　　沙柳和柠条具有生长迅速、适应性强、耐旱等多种特点。为了进一步提高幼苗的成活率，当地巧妙运用了可降解容器种植技术，配合机械化植苗，即便三个月不下雨，幼苗也能在沙地中茁壮成长，提高了成活率。\n　　\n　　在种植现场，工作人员将沙柳和柠条的幼苗植入可降解的无纺布育苗袋中，再以科学比例调配保水剂与生根粉混入土壤中。保水剂如同一块海绵，雨天吸水膨胀，旱时则缓慢释放水分，为幼苗提供源源不断的水分供应；生根粉则刺激幼苗快速生根，让其能更牢固地扎根于沙土之中。\n　　 “天空地一体化”监测 治理到每一寸土地\n　　在防沙治沙工作中，监测和评估是确保治沙项目成功的重要环节。\n　　\n　　为了更精准地评估治理效果，鄂尔多斯市林草部门采用了“天空地一体化”监测体系。在工作人员的手持电脑上，卫星图像、无人机监测数据和地面实时位置一目了然。通过这些数据，工作人员能够精准调整治沙策略，优化种植布局，确保每一寸沙地都能得到最有效的治理。\n　　\n　　记者从内蒙古自治区林业和草原局获悉，2024年，内蒙古以科技赋能生态治理，完成防沙治沙1954万亩，累计完成义务植树4300余万株。 今年，预计完成防沙治沙2000万亩以上。\n　　乡土树种沙柳 防沙治沙作用大\n　　沙柳作为乡土树种，在防沙治沙工作中是如何发挥着重要作用的？\n　　 沙柳要想长得好 3到5年要平茬\n　　在毛乌素沙地腹地的鄂尔多斯市鄂托克旗苏米图苏木，眼下，牧民们正操作着沙柳平茬收割机、运输车辆等多台设备，在沙柳丛中穿梭，紧张有序地开展沙柳的平茬与运输工作。\n　　\n　　平茬是一种农林管理措施，即将植物的地上部分从近地面处全部割除或砍断，类似于“重修剪”。其目的是刺激植物从根部或茎基部重新萌发新枝，促进植物更新复壮、延长寿命。\n　　\n　　沙柳是一种耐旱、成活率高、抗风沙的灌木，常见于我国西北沙漠地区，是重要的固沙植物。它根系发达，平茬后能迅速从根茎处萌发新枝，生长速度比未平茬的植株更快。若不定期平茬，沙柳会生长减缓、逐渐衰老，甚至死亡，老化的枝条易折断，固沙能力下降。在毛乌素沙地等地区，平茬管理是沙柳人工林可持续经营的关键技术，对防治荒漠化意义重大。\n　　 沙柳枝条再利用 铺设沙障来治沙\n　　\n　　为了最大化利用沙柳枝条的生态功能，当地就地取材，降低治沙成本。平茬后的沙柳枝条经科学运输，就近用于沙障铺设或扦插治沙，既是治沙材料，又是经济资源。\n　　内蒙古荒漠化土地面积8.89亿亩，是全国沙化土地最为集中、危害最为严重的省区之一。担负着国家“三北”工程六期沙化土地治理60%的任务量。近年来，内蒙古各地在防沙治沙项目中，大力推广“以工代赈”政策，吸纳带动低收入群众就地就近就业，促进当地农牧民就业增收。\n　　\n　　目前， 内蒙古育苗总面积达到39万亩，能用于“三北”工程所需苗木总量达21亿株， 各类苗木数量供应充足。\n[责任编辑：李响]",

    "text": "[Janine Adamski](/email/node/74911/field_email?destination=node/74911)\nKALAMAZOO, Mich.—Western Michigan University senior Victoria Loikits says she's proud to be making a difference in people’s lives. As a human resource management student, Loikits is excited to play a role in helping companies realize that people are their greatest asset.\nAs she prepares to graduate in spring 2024, Loikits of South Haven, Michigan, says she is grateful for the self-discovery opportunities she encountered at the Haworth College of Business.\n“WMU Haworth provided an outstanding education where I was able to explore a variety of majors before settling on human resources. Not only that, but the college gave me the technical skills I needed to be an asset in the HR field when starting internships and going into a full-time role.”\nLoikits has completed two internships. In the summer of 2022, she worked as an information technology training and development intern at Stryker. There, she was responsible for identifying courses, experiences and resources to support the development of IT employees in terms of key competencies. She explored both Gallup domains and Senn Delaney behavioral work styles and helped design a proposal for a three-segment rotational program that will be implemented in the IT function within the next year.\nThe following summer, Loikits worked as a compensation/center of excellence intern at Whirlpool. In this position, she implemented a new set of global guidelines in five regions surrounding broad-based cash retention. She implemented a project that focused on changes to the company stock plan, developing her skills in vendor and project management. She also drafted and audited over 180 measuring employee performance (MEP) letters to notify employees that they would be receiving cash awards based on their previous year’s work. In addition, she sat on a global specialist team where she led calls focused on enhancing engagement. Following her graduation, Loikits will return to Whirlpool as a full-time employee on the rotational development program.\nIt is because of the opportunities available to her at WMU Haworth, Loikits says she has found success early-on in her career.\n“The Zhang Career Center has propelled my professionalism forward. Through the center, I have had my resume critiqued, participated in many developmental events and honed in on my interview skills.”\nBeyond her academic experiences, Loikits has taken advantage of registered student organizations and campus jobs. She is a member of Delta Sigma Pi where she has held leadership positions including senior vice president and vice president of pledge education. She is also the current vice president of operations for the Society of Excellence in Human Resources. Putting her passion for helping others to work, Loikits is also employed as a peer educator in the Zhang Career Center and as a student ambassador for WMU Haworth.\nAs her graduation date draws closer, she reflects on her time as a student at WMU Haworth.\n“Take advantage of every opportunity. Don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and do things that are new and different. I also recommend trying to connect with the faculty and peers. They are here to help you, and they want to see you succeed.”\nFor more WMU news, arts and events, visit\n[WMU News](/news) online.",

    "text": "On Wednesday, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) announced that South Carolina basketball star sophomore forward Collin Murray-Boyles earned inclusion on their All-South Atlantic District as a first-team selection. Instead of choosing postseason award teams by conference, the NABC now organizes them geographically. There are ten geographic regions represented by NABC all-district teams. Murray-Boyles earned the honor after averaging 16.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 blocks per game for the Gamecocks. He also shot better than 58% from the field, leading the SEC in the category among qualified players. No other player in college basketball averaged at least 16 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block, and 55% field goal efficiency. CMB also was one of the top (and most versatile) defenders in the sport. Murray-Boyles also earned several All-SEC honors this March. Stay on top of all things Gamecocks for just $1 for 7 days—lock in this special offer today! The Columbia, South Carolina native has NBA decision-makers salivating. Because of that, most NBA Draft mocks have him within their first-round projections. Some even predict a spot for Murray-Boyles in the NBA Draft lottery (first 14 picks) . If Murray-Boyles hears his name called in the first round this summer, he’ll be the first Gamecock star to earn a top-30 spot since the New York Knicks took Renaldo Balkman at pick No. 20 in 2006. GG Jackson (No. 45 to the Memphis Grizzlies in 2023) was the last USC player to earn NBA Draft selection. This year’s NBA Draft will take place on Friday, June 25th and Saturday, June 26th. Murray-Boyles’ final deadline to decide if he will return to school or enter the draft will be mid-June. ABC, ESPN, and the ESPN app will broadcast and stream coverage of the festivities.

    "text": "La [tormenta de Santa Rosa](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/santa-rosa) está más cerca que nunca y ya rige un [alerta meteorológico](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/alerta-meteorologica) con [lluvias](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/lluvias) y [tormentas](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/tormentas). En este contexto, se dio a conocer una importante advertencia para saber cuál es el [electrodoméstico](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/electrodomesticos) que siempre se debe desenchufar en estos casos para evitar un [incendio](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/incendios). El [Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN)](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/servicio-meteorologico-nacional) anunció lluvias y tormentas para el transcurso del viernes 30 y sábado 31 de agosto en [Buenos Aires](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/buenos-aires) en el marco de la llegada de la tormenta Santa Rosa. Es por eso que distintas recomendaciones salieron a la luz para advertir a la población acerca de esta alerta amarilla. Entre ellas, se encuentran las más comunes para tener en consideración en el [hogar](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/hogar). Es sabido que debido a una tormenta fuerte, los artefactos del hogar quedan expuestos, pero hay uno con el que hay que tener más cuidado. Se trata de la tostadora, que normalmente se debe desenchufar inmediatamente después de usarla, pero esto se refuerza si llueve. Por qué hay que desenchufar la tostadora para evitar un incendio El aparato funciona a través de resistencias eléctricas que alcanzan altas temperaturas para tostar el pan. Si no se desconecta, pueden permanecer calientes y podría provocar que las migas restantes se incendien. No solo eso, sino que dejar la tostadora enchufada de manera frecuente puede causar una sobrecarga en el circuito eléctrico del hogar aumentando el riesgo de incendio. Además, la tostadora registra un riesgo de fallos en los componentes eléctricos ya que pueden generar cortocircuitos y aumentar el peligro de incendios. Dejarla enchufada incluso cuando se usa puede contribuir a un consumo de energía innecesario, lo que genera un aumento en los costos de electricidad y el riesgo de sobrecalentamiento del aparato. De esta manera desenchufar la tostadora es una medida preventiva simple, pero efectiva teniendo en cuenta sus consecuencias peligrosas. Por qué las zapatillas eléctricas son la segunda causa de incendios en casas En muchos hogares, es común usar enchufes múltiples, conocidos popularmente como \" [zapatillas eléctricas](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/atr/alerta-meteorologica/alerta-zapatillas-electricas-que-hacer-tras-el-pronostico-de-lluvias-y-tormentas-20248112410)\", para conectar varios dispositivos a una sola toma de corriente. Sin embargo, este hábito puede ser peligroso, ya que según datos de los Bomberos de la Ciudad, el segundo mayor porcentaje de los [incendios](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/incendios), en los que solo interviene la Justicia, son por “contingencia eléctrica”, es decir, producto de zapatillas, cargadores de celular o falla en los conductores. De acuerdo a la explicación de expertos, es fundamental considerar la potencia de los [electrodomésticos](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/electrodomesticos) que se conectan a una zapatilla y asegurarse de que los productos sean de alta calidad y estén certificados, como por el IRAM en Argentina. De esta manera, se evitarán problemas como cortocircuitos y se garantizará la seguridad en el hogar. En 2022 hubo 1.510 casos por contingencia eléctrica. De ese número, 1.043 fueron por principio de incendio, 441 fueron incendios chicos, 15 medianos y 11 alarmas de incendio. “Por lo general, estos incendios se dan por una falta de mantenimiento en la instalación eléctrica del hogar o una sobrecarga o problema en los cargadores”, explicó Martín López Calvo, jefe de investigación de incendios y explosiones del cuerpo de Bomberos de la Ciudad. \"Se recomienda hacer un mantenimiento del tablero eléctrico. Y en el caso de instalarlo, que lo haga un electricista matriculado porque sabrá cuál es el consumo de la casa y va a diseñarlo de acuerdo a los consumos que tenés”, indicó la experta, en diálogo con Clarín.",

Calvià ha sido de los primeros municipios de la geografía balear donde ha descargado la lluvia. En la jornada de este viernes está previsto que caigan hasta 50 litros por metro cuadrado. Todas las Baleares se encuentran en alerta naranja por fuertes precipitaciones. En los vídeos que han publicado los usuarios en las redes sociales puede observarse cómo están siendo las lluvias en el municipio de Calvià. El agua llega a acumularse por toda la calzada e inunda gran parte del bordillo. En otras imágenes puede verse cómo ha continuado lloviendo con intensidad no sólo en la localidad sino también a la zona montañosa. Desde el Servicio de Emergencias 112 Illes Balears se ha solicitado a la población evitar los desplazamientos por carretera que no sean estrictamente necesarios. También se ha hecho un llamamiento a, en el caso de circular, moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. También este viernes sobre las 13.20 horas ha empezado a llover en la zona de Cala Major, en Palma.

    "title": "Why is south Indian coffee so special?",
    "text": "South Indian filter coffee made headlines last week when it was voted the second best coffee in the world. The list of 10 coffees, announced by popular food guide platform Taste Atlas, was topped by Cuban espresso.\nCoffee experts and restaurateurs believe the extraction process, wallet friendly prices and high degree of heat are what set this beverage, an important part of southern Indian culture, apart.\n“I wouldn’t say it is superior to other coffees, but it is quite unique,” begins Suhas Dwarakanath, founder, Specialty Coffee Academy of India, headquartered in Jayanagar.\nThe extraction process allows the water, which trickles down slowly, to gather more flavours, aroma, body and aftertaste from the coffee blend, he explains.\n“Typically, the decoction takes 10-15 minutes to be ready for use. In most other brewing methods, this process lasts only two to three minutes,”\nDwarakanath points out.\nThe caffeine content in filter coffee is also higher. “That is why it is served in 100 ml cups. Other coffees like cappuccino and Americano are offered in 235 ml to 470 ml cups,” he says.\nAlthough the method of brewing is standard, every restaurant in south India has a different preference of grind size, blend and coffee ratio, he observes.\nZero chicory\nAt the 100-year-old Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR), near Lalbagh, beans are sourced from estates in Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu. The beans are roasted and ground every day at their manufacturing unit and then distributed to all their outlets. The roasting and grinding is overseen by an expert hired for the job. “Our blend is created without any\nchicory,” says Hemamalini Maiya, managing partner.\nShe explains that MTR pays special attention to the strength of the decoction. “It makes all the difference,” she says. “In other coffees like cappuccino, the aroma is not as strong. In south Indian filter coffee, the decoction is extremely thick and concentrated.”\nAccording to Santosh Shanbhag, the coffee at his restaurant, Chalukya Samrat on Church Street (earlier on Race Course Road), has remained consistent for close to 48 years. It comes from Bayar’s Coffee, a specialty roastery founded in 1974. “We have not switched to cheaper brands despite multiple offers, because we wanted to keep the taste consistent,” he says.\nThe powder is roasted and ground to the restaurant’s specifications — medium roast, with a balance of Arabica and other beans and a little bit of chicory. “The chicory adds a touch of sweetness, preferred by our customers,” says Shanbhag.\nHeat matters\nBrahmins’ Coffee Bar, Shankarapura, was set up in 1932 by Radhakrishna Adiga’s father. “Back in the day, it offered nothing more than coffee. The beans were procured from and roasted by some friends of my father,” says Adiga.\nThey now get their coffee roasted at Sri Vasanth Coffee Works on Sajjan Rao Circle and grind it at their eatery. Their thick brews are extracted from a mix of Arabica, robusta and five per cent chicory. “Chicory also lends the decoction a bit of thickness,” Adiga explains. The secret to the perfect cup also lies in the temperature. “It has to be piping hot, else it’s not filter coffee,” he says.\nThe popularity of south Indian filter coffee can also be attributed to its price, he believes. “Italian coffee costs upwards of Rs 150. But you will be able to find a good cup of filter coffee for as little as Rs 10,” he notes.\nAt Coffee Angadi in Jayanagar, Ramesh Hunsur, owner, offers two varieties of coffee — one made with 100 per cent Arabica and robusta beans, and another mixed with 20 per cent chicory. “For filter coffee, it is ideal to use a little bit of chicory,” Ramesh says.\nFun facts about filter coffee\nCoffee has been grown in India since the 17th century. The practice of adding chicory to coffee was introduced by the British and French colonisers.\nIn the 1920s, a coffee brand by the name Sakamma Coffee Works gained popularity in the state. It was started by a woman named Sakamma from Coorg. She came to be known as Coffee Pudi Sakamma after she moved to Bangalore and set up a coffee powdering unit on Bull Temple Road in 1920.\nSouth India on food map\nTaste Atlas’ food rankings have gone viral on multiple occasions. Last December, south India made it to the top 100 best food regions in the world. In 2023, Corner House’s Death By Chocolate was on the list of 100 most iconic ice creams in the world.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 14 March 2024, 22:41 IST)",
