    "text": "Un hombre reportado por las autoridades con “hipotermia severa”, fue encontrado escondido en el tren de aterrizaje de un avión que aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Orly, en París, Francia; la aeronave procedía de Argelia. De acuerdo con el personal del aeropuerto que localizó al hombre, indicaron que estaba en condiciones terribles y muy grave, pues durante el vuelo, se alcanzan grandes alturas, por lo que la temperatura puede llegar a temperaturas de -50 grados centígrados. “Hemos encontrado a un joven en la parte del tren de aterrizaje de un vuelo que llegó desde Orán (noroeste de Argelia)”, dijo el personal del aeropuerto de Orly. El joven, de aproximadamente 20 años de edad y cuya identidad no se ha revelado, lo encontraron al rededor de las 9:30 y 10:00 horas (tiempo local), cuando el personal realizaba las “inspecciones técnicas” a la aeronave justo después de haber aterrizado.

La hipotermia es el resultado de las extremas condiciones climáticas a altitudes elevadas, lo cual llevó a una situación crítica para el intruso. Hasta el momento, no se saben los motivos que lo llevaron a arriesgarse de esa manera, pero es muy probable que sea un migrante que intentó salir de su país de manera ilegal. La investigación por parte de las autoridades parisinas se mantiene en curso para determinar cómo el individuo logró acceder al tren de aterrizaje y qué motivaciones lo llevaron a asumir semejante riesgo.

    "text": "punjabkesari.in Friday, December 29, 2023 – 10:10 pm (IST) Sports Desk: Afghanistan’s opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, playing against UAE on the ground of Sharjah, scored a century in just 50 balls and made his team cross 200. Gurbaz, who scored his first century in the T20 format, started taking notice of the UAE bowlers from the very beginning. He hit shots around the wicket and scored 100 runs with the help of 7 fours and 7 sixes. With this, 22-year-old Gurbaz has completed 68 sixes in 44 T20 matches. This innings of Gurbaz was also special because he had not been able to perform anything special in the last four domestic Twenty20 matches. Gurbaz was playing for Strikers in the Abu Dhabi T10. He scored 0 against Braves and also 0 against Samp Army. In the next match, he was successful in scoring 56 runs but in the last match, he was out again after scoring only 1 run. Now he must be feeling some relief after scoring a century against UAE. First T20 century! A brilliant innings from Gurbaz [#UAEvAFG] [pic.twitter.com/RKkVCbaG5Q] – FanCode (@FanCode) [29 December 2023] Talking about the match, Gurbaz and Hazratullah Jazai had come at the opening. When Zazai was out after scoring 13 runs in 16 balls, Gurbaz along with captain Ibrahim Zadran took the score forward. While Gurbaz was successful in scoring 100 runs in 52 balls, Ibrahim Zadran scored 59 runs in 43 balls with the help of 4 fours and two sixes. Azmatullah scored 19 runs on 8 balls. Nabi also contributed 4 runs on 1 ball and scored 203 runs. In reply, UAE had a very bad start. Opener Khalid Shah was out after scoring 0 runs and Mohammad Wasim was out after scoring 4 runs. When the score was 23 in the fifth over, UAE also lost the wicket of Samal. Afghanistan’s bowlers were excellent during this period. He troubled the UAE batsmen a lot.",

    "text": "The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike , on Thursday, slammed former Senator Shehu Sani over the latter’s claim that pro-democracy activists should have taken power in 1999 after the exit of the military. Mr Wike, a former Governor of Rivers State, questioned the performance of Mr Sani as a member of the 8th Assembly, stating that “activists don’t perform in office”. The minister said this at the 2024 Annual Lecture and Awards ceremony organised by This Nigeria newspaper Annual Lecture and Gold Prize Award in Abuja on Thursday. The theme of the event was “25 Years of Nigeria’s Unbroken Democracy: Prospects & Possibilities. ” | | During a panel discussion, Mr Sani, a prominent activist during the struggle against the military in the 90s, narrated how pro-democracy activists shunned the transition plan of the Abudulsalam Abubakar regime, a decision the former lawmaker said allowed the career politicians to take over power. He disclosed that the former military leader urged most of them to participate in the transition process, but they declined. He added that by the time they changed their minds, the career politicians had taken over. Mr Sani said some of the prominent activists, including the late legal luminary, Gani Fawehinmi, Femi Falana and others, declined to participate but that Bola Tinubu, who later became the governor of Lagos in 1999, agreed to participate in the transition process. “…And after four years in prison, when we came out from prison, this is where the story is going to begin. Abdulsalam Abubakar invited all who fought for democracy—‘that I am going to hand over power to a democratically elected government. I want all of you, the freedom fighters, to come together and take over power.’ At that very time, Gani opposed it. Three times, he invited us; we even refused to answer his calls. “He didn’t invite the politicians; they were knocking at his door. After we decided to listen to him, we came and sat down. “But after our struggle in 1998 and 1999, we said we were not going to cooperate with the military. Gani opposed, Falana opposed, all opposed. It was Tinubu who said if we don’t get in, who would be there? “By the time we all agreed to join the politics, politicians had taken over all positions. Gani tried to be president, and Falana tried to be governor of his state, he couldn’t. I tried to be governor of Kaduna State, I couldn’t because all the spaces had been taken over,” Mr Sani said. It was at this point that Mr Wike requested the microphone, stating that just because Mr Sani and others participated in the struggle does not mean power should be handed over to them. ALSO READ: [Journalists, activists react to BBC documentary about Nigerian cleric] Mr Wike said activists often fail at governance, adding that Mr Sani should produce his scorecard as a senator. He said, “The mere fact that you were an activist does not mean that you do well. Activists have always failed. “Activists have failed. We have seen activists that were given appointments, and yet they failed. When you were a senator, how did you perform? What was your performance as a senator?” Mr Wike also took a shot at another panellist, Mike Ozekhome, a prominent lawyer, during the diatribe. He asked Mr Ozekhome, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), not to pontificate on election matters. “And you said something about taking the election side. As an activist, how many times have you rejected briefs, those who have rigged the election, you have always defended them,” Mr Wike said. Messrs Sani and Ozekhome did not get the opportunity to reply.

    "title": "Self-learning AI generates NFL against the spread, over-under, money-line picks for each 2024 Week 3 game",
    "text": "By CBS Sports Staff ,\n2 hours ago USATSI The largest NFL favorites the first two weeks of the 2024 NFL season lost outright, another example of parity across the NFL. The Bengals (-7.5) are the largest favorites on the Week 3 NFL schedule, according to the latest Week 3 NFL odds from the SportsLine Consensus, against the Washington Commanders. How should you feel about playing the Bengals with a high spread in Week 3 NFL betting picks and NFL parlay picks? Elsewhere, the San Francisco 49ers are 7-point favorites against the Los Angeles Rams in the latest Week 3 NFL betting spreads, the only other game with a touchdown spread or higher on the Week 3 NFL Vegas odds.\nEleven of 16 games were decided by seven points or fewer last week, so how should that factor into making Week 3 NFL predictions? Before you make any Week 3 NFL picks, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over-under, and money line predictions powered by SportsLine AI .\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game. The AI predictions are determined by statistically learning from each team's historical data and then quantitatively evaluating the strength of the opponent's defense by assigning a numeric value out of 100 called a matchup score.\nOnce a prediction is formulated, the AI rating is generated using the prediction, the matchup score, and the odds of the market. For example, you could see an A-rating on an over bet if a team is facing a poor defense, their prediction differs from the line and there are favorable odds.\nIn addition, SportsLine AI is the first fully automated predictive model at SportsLine. It continuously refreshes on the most recent available data and can help you spot the biggest discrepancies in the lines. Last season, SportsLine's AI PickBot hit a whopping 1,674 4.5- and 5-star prop picks. Anyone who has followed it is way up.\nFor Week 3, the AI PickBot has evaluated the NFL odds and provided NFL betting predictions for all 16 games. You can only see the AI predictions for the Week 3 NFL schedule here .\nTop Week 3 NFL AI picks After analyzing every game in Week 3, the AI PickBot says the Rams cover as seven-point home underdogs against the 49ers . The Rams are dealing with some devastating injuries at the moment, especially on offense. Cooper Kupp (ankle) and Puka Nacua (knee) are both out and the Rams offensive line is dealing with injuries as well. But Stafford has dealt with leading an offense without Kupp due to injuries in previous seasons as the 36-year-old quarterback can read a defense and spread the ball around to the open player even without an elite receiver on the field. The Rams averaged 24.5 points per game in their first four games of the season last year without Kupp.\nThe 49ers aren't entering at full strength either with Christian McCaffrey (calf/Achilles) and Deebo Samuel (calf) out. Brock Purdy hasn't been the same MVP-caliber QB this season without some of his top playmakers as he's averaging 11.7 yards per completion, the fewest of his three-year career. Purdy had two turnovers (one fumble, one interception) as the 49ers lost 23-17 to the Vikings last week and AI PickBot expects the Rams to hang with San Francisco on Sunday. See its other Week 3 football predictions and football picks at SportsLine .\nHow to make Week 3 NFL picks In addition, the AI PickBot has generated five other A-rated picks for Week 3. You need to see the AI PickBot's picks before making any Week 3 NFL bets of your own. You can only see them at SportsLine .\nWho wins and covers each Week 3 NFL game, and which A-rated picks should you target? Visit SportsLine now to see the top NFL picks against the spread, over-under, and on money line, all from the brand-new SportsLine AI PickBot that nailed 1,674 top-rated picks last season .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "As much as everyone loves to be in love.\nLove is never guaranteed.\nSome love stories turn into absolute nightmares.\nNot every ex can let it all go.\nThat problem leads to a lot of scary moments and lifelong trauma.\nRedditor\ndieburtually wanted to hear about the worst of people's exes, so they asked:\n\"What is the worst thing your ex has done to you?\"\nWithout a Care\n\"Left me at the hospital without my purse, wallet, or phone leaving me to walk home alone in the very early hours of the morning which drug addicts frequent, all while still reeling in the pain of a ruptured ovarian cyst. I walked into the apartment to find him playing WoW without a care.\"\n- PrettyCarCrash\nAngry Season 4 GIF by The Office\nGiphy\nCruel\n\"After supporting her with her whole\neducation, she cheated on me. The worst part is she even took our cat... left me traumatized to the point that I have serious trust issues.\"\n- Parking_Release_6899\n\"Brother. I'm still paying my exes' loan for schooling off, as I cosigned for it, and she just decided to 'stop paying.'\"\n\"Mine left on her\nbirthday, while I was recovering from a serious spinal surgery and still learning how to walk again.\"\n\"At least she didn't take my cat. I also have remarkable trust issues as well.\"\n- Robert999220\nTrauma\n\"Cheated, left, and got our two sons we were in the process of adopting taken away. Betrayal trauma sucks. There was nothing I could do legally when they showed up. And the boys have been with us for over 3 years… they called her a kidnapper and begged me not to make them go. It was devastating. And he just sat there emotionless like it was nothing.\"\n- freckledpeach2\nThat's not YOU!\n\"My ex scoured the internet until she found pictures that looked similar to her body, she cropped the image to get rid of the face, accused me of taking nude photos of her that she just happened to stumble upon online, and when I didn't go for it, pointing out that it was physically impossible for the photo to be her because I was on another continent for a year, she tried to tell me I must have took it in a\nhotel we stayed at before that. When I held my ground there because there was never a f**king fern in the hotel, she very nonchalantly said, 'Well you have to admit it looks like me.'\"\n\"Anyway, I have custody of our daughter now, and she lives a thousand miles away.\"\n- VT_Squire\nTextbook\n\"Cheated on me, but the worst part for me was that she wouldn't admit it even after the relationship was done, and we never had to see each other again. I was told by somebody else months after, but the way she acted in the last few months was textbook, but I was too stupid to see it at the time. Even when I straight up asked her, she refused to say either way.\"\n- DrWhoop87\nThe Runaway\n\"Recently? Left the state with our shared vehicle. There’s nothing I can do about it since we both own it. My mom’s fixing up her older vehicle for me so I can at least get my kids to and from school. He ran off. I don’t even know where he went. I’m almost certain he’s in another state now as this happened overnight Friday into Saturday.\"\n\"He owns the vehicle, so it’s legally not stolen.\"\n\"My only hope is that the starter motor falls off. I just had my stepdad and brother-in-law over last weekend to put a new starter motor in. They said in about two weeks, they need to come back and tighten it up, or it could fall off. Two weeks will be next Saturday. I hope it falls off while he’s speeding down the highway (and no one else gets hurt).\"\n- PaleOverlord\nPay Up\n\"I supported her for years while she made next to zero income so she could chase her dream/passion. When she started to have success, she found someone and cheated on me with them. Then insisted I owed her money for the divorce despite not having contributed to the household.\"\n- DuffNinja\nHip Hop Television GIF by WE tv\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/wetv-rap-bye-enrm3x92DlZy2u9og9\n3 Years\n\"Lead me on to believe we were in a serious relationship.\"\n\"I went to propose, and she broke down crying about how she was going back to her ex. He was her first true love. They had a history together.\"\n\"Wasn’t like me and her hadn’t been together for 3 years.\"\n\"A few months later she called crying asking me to take her back after he beat her.\"\n- arousedpirate\n\"Just went through something similar. We were together almost 3 years and living together. He was not over his ex the whole time and talking to her behind my back telling her he’s never loved anyone else as much as her. Wtf dude.\"\n- Pitiful-Orchid\nSorry\n\"Mine is silly more than anything. A month after we broke up, their cat died. They started posting on Facebook every day about how hard it's been after losing me, their cat, and my dog in such a short time span, but the way each post was worded it sounded like I had also passed away. So much so that people started reaching out to my\nparents asking what happened to me and if they had missed the funeral service. 🤣\"\n- hughjonk\nLIARS\n\"My exes' mum got cheated on by her dad. They were happily married for 30 years. I supported her through this at the time and had her on the phone crying to me. After her experiencing all of this, she then cheated on me AND LIED ABOUT IT. MUST RUN IN THE FAMILY.\"\n- Clean_Specialist8551\nI Don't Like Her\n\"I dated a girl for about 3 months whose previous relationship ended after 3 years. Well one day, she just breaks up with me for what I see as no apparent reason. A week later, her Facebook says she's engaged. Come to find out, her ex had reached out to her and proposed and she said yes.\"\n\"We weren't together long enough for me to really care, but man that was a shi**y couple of days after the fact. I don't like her.\"\n- HeartachetoHouston\nDear Mom\n\"My mother passed away a few years ago and this girl I had only been dating for maybe 3 months manipulated me by using my mom as a weapon against me. He would say things like 'Do you think your mother would be proud of what you are doing now?' or 'Is this what your mother would want of you?' He would do this whenever I would effectively mess up in his eyes. It tore me down pretty hard.\n- Babeee_Whisperr\n7 Years Down\n\"My ex prioritized everything else other than our relationship. We were together for almost 7 years. Never lived together, never engaged, never bought me flowers, never anything. I'd have to beg him to take me out anywhere. His main focus was college (which I supported). We were also high school sweethearts (we started dating junior year). He lived with his parents and grandparents. I eventually got tired of feeling like I wasn't a priority and left him. It was a nasty breakup.\"\n- RedMinx98\nStop Swinging\n\"Not as bad as some but one time we went camping, and she got drunk and just became mean to everyone. She was having a freak out over I don’t even know anyways when I tried to calm her down she bit me 3 times and then clocked me in the face 3 times all in about 5 minutes.\"\n- Slow-Caregiver6339\nCAD!\n\"I married a boy in kindergarten on the playground, and he married another woman the next day.\"\n- Exact-Cockroach8528\nGary Coleman 80S GIF\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/gary-coleman-different-strokes-arnold-jackson-TDnai8jDt7iSI\nIs romance alive?\nIs it sustainable?\nI have no idea.\nNot every partner is evil, but there are a lot of duds out there.\nEscaping some exes feels like a lifelong journey.\nRelationships are clearly not for the faint of heart.\nAdele was right... love really IS a game for fools.\nAnd we'll all keep playing.",

    "text": "Heavy, blowing snow continues to hit parts of southern Ontario.\nAfter heavy snowfall dumped over 20 cm in the Barrie area on Thursday, snowsqualls continue to hit the area and communities just north of the GTA, according to Environment Canada.\nThe lake effect snow off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay is continuing Friday morning,.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada issued snowsquall warnings for Barrie, Orillia, Bruce Peninsula, Tobermory, Lindsay, Kawathra Lakes, Midland, Owen Sound, Peterborough, Uxbridge and Beaverton.\nAreas in the southwest such as Kitchener, Waterloo, Woodstock and Oxford Country have snowsquall advisories.\nThe heavy snowfall could bring an additional five to 10 cm of accumulation.\nThere will be poor visibility at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nLake effect snow is expected to move south of the area later Friday morning.\nThe lake effect snow will return this weekend over some areas. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\nEnvironment Canada suggests drivers consider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve.\nAreas in red have snowsquall warnings, yellow areas are watches and the grey is a weather statement for possible heavy snow.\nLead photo: Dylan Freedom",
