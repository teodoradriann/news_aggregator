    "title": "'Gift to Trump': Supreme Court watcher slams justices' failure to make decision",
    "text": "Frontpage news and politics With another day of Supreme Court decisions that ended with inaction on the two major cases involving former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in D.C. , judicial analyst Jeffrey Toobin took to X to slam the justices' delay — and warn that they are rapidly closing the window of opportunity to let special counsel Jack Smith try his case before the election in November. \"The Supreme Court's ongoing delay in deciding the immunity case is a gift to Trump , regardless of the ultimate result,\" wrote Toobin. \"The Justices are taking so long that it may well be impossible to try the case before November, even if they rule that the case can proceed.\" Smith has charged Trump with conspiracy for his involvement in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election result. That case is on hold until the Supreme Court decides multiple major questions surrounding it. He is also bringing another case in Florida regarding Trump's retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, but District Judge Aileen Cannon, herself a Trump appointee, has controversially suspended a trial indefinitely until a number of pretrial motions are resolved. One of the Supreme Court cases in question is a direct appeal from Trump to have them declare he has immunity , as a former president, from prosecution for anything he did in his official capacity. While it is considered unlikely the justices would declare the entire case invalid on a presidential immunity basis, they could possibly rule that lower courts need to decide what is and isn't an official act and throw out charges or evidence based on that distinction, a complication that could drag out the trial to past the election. The other case involves a January 6 Capitol riot defendant, Joseph Fischer, who is arguing that obstruction charges should not apply to his conduct. While this case doesn't involve Trump directly, a ruling that invalidates Fischer's charges could also potentially apply to some of the charges Smith brought against Trump. Stop wondering if Trump's felony convictions will hurt his campaign ... › Ex-prosecutor: SCOTUS delay in deciding Trump immunity is 'corrosive' to democracy › Supreme Court will have 'signed its own death warrant' by ruling in Trump’s favor: analysis ›",

    "title": "New Draft Guidance Provides Detailed (And Burdensome) Recommendations For Chemical Assessments To Su",
    "text": "FDA recently issued a draft guidance, [Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility\nAssessment of Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/media/181952/download), which describes chemical\ncharacterization methods that may be used to demonstrate\nbiocompatibility of a medical device as an alternative to\nconducting certain biological testing. Chemical characterization\nidentifies and quantifies chemicals that may be released from the\nmedical device, while a toxicological risk analysis (TRA) evaluates\nthe risks to the patient associated with the chemicals identified.\nData from chemical characterization studies must be evaluated in a\nseparate TRA following ISO 10993-17 guidelines.\nFor FDA submissions, this strategy can be used to evaluate the biocompatibility endpoints acute, subacute, subchronic, and chronic systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive/developmental toxicity. That is, the biocompatibility endpoints cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation/intracutaneous reactivity, material-mediate pyrogenicity, implantation, and hemocompatibility are not covered by the approach discussed in the new draft guidance. Chemical characterization can also be useful in evaluating a change to the materials or manufacturing of a device.\nAlthough the draft guidance states that the approach can be used for limited (< 24 hour), prolonged (1-30 days), or long-term (> 30 days) contact devices and \"can reduce the time needed to complete biocompatibility testing by evaluating multiple biocompatibility endpoints at once and can reduce animal testing\", it is rarely going to save sponsors time or money to use chemical characterization in place of biological testing for most limited and prolonged contact devices to support FDA premarket submissions.\nUsing chemical characterization and toxicological risk analysis to support the biocompatibility of a medical device is not new. Since the first issuance of FDA's guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, \"Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process\" in 2016, sponsors submitting premarket submissions to FDA have had the option of using these techniques to evaluate certain biocompatibility endpoints. Many sponsors want to reduce animal testing and, therefore, welcome the approach. However, the experience in practice has been one of frustration as sponsors have struggled to reach agreement with the Agency on acceptable methods and acceptance criteria for these chemical assessments, despite FDA's partial recognition of the ISO 10993-18 and -17 standards that describe methods for chemical characterization and TRA, respectively. Many sponsors have given up and opted to conduct biological studies instead of chemical assessments given the significant uncertainty with the non-animal based approach. FDA also notes variability in the approaches, inconsistent analytical chemistry reports, and deficiencies in review of premarket submissions as a driver for the draft guidance.\nThe draft guidance provides recommendations for collection and reporting of chemical characterization data and discusses the topics of information gathering, test article extraction, chemical analysis, and data reporting. The main body of the draft guidance provides high-level recommendations, and four appendices provide detailed recommendations for test design. Many of the details provide helpful clarity and it is noted that many of the recommendations in the draft guidance follow feedback FDA has provided to sponsors in Pre-Submissions and deficiencies over the last few years; but for others, FDA's recommendations feel overly burdensome and not tolerable of any uncertainty or risk. The following topics stood out as being burdensome and likely areas for FDA scrutiny of a sponsor's chemical characterization data:\n- One such area relates to determining a device's contact duration. The general guidance for biocompatibility references ISO 10993-1 for identification of the nature and duration of contact, including cumulative effects with repeated use. The standard describes contact duration as the cumulative sum of single, multiple, or repeated duration of contact. However, Appendix A of the draft guidance contradicts the standard, stating that devices with short duration, but repeated use are categorized according to the total number of days and not the total amount of time. Watch for a follow-up post on this particular topic.\n- One of the most common issues with chemical characterization studies is that the use of harsh non-polar and semi-polar solvents (e.g., hexane and isopropanol) can be incompatible with many devices, including common polymers like silicones. Exhaustive extraction in these solvents can lead to high levels of product degradation or increased levels of extractables found in the chemical data, which is not expected during clinical use, and can often result in a TRA with a negative or inconclusive outcome. Although FDA suggests in the draft guidance to investigate use of multiple solvents to find a suitable one, this is sometimes not possible even after many rounds of attempted feasibility studies performed by the labs. In this regard, FDA states if compatible solvents cannot be identified, then chemical characterization data would not be appropriate to support a TRA and biological testing would be needed. Although the draft guidance suggests that chemical characterization data can reduce time and animal testing requirements for biocompatibility evaluations, this will not be the case for many medical devices, including some long-term contact devices, for these reasons. Furthermore, because some animal testing to address long-term endpoints is not practical or feasible to perform, sponsors can find themselves in a very difficult position. FDA suggests that simulated use/leachables studies to simulate the clinical use (i.e., in a more clinically relevant solvent) and release kinetics data can be helpful; we agree with FDA's thoughts regarding usefulness of these alternative studies especially in the cases where devices are incompatible with non-polar and/or semi-polar solvents and to more accurately estimate clinically relevant exposures. We would encourage FDA to consider releasing guidances on both of these topics in parallel with the subject guidance.\n- Another area that FDA discusses throughout the draft guidance is that chemical identities of extractables must be \"confident\" or \"confirmed\" levels to be used in the TRA. However, it is very common to have \"tentative\" or \"unknown\" identifications in chemical characterization studies. In the draft guidance, FDA illustrates the need for additional orthogonal data (i.e., additional primary detection methods) in the sponsor's methods to help with identification. FDA also suggests throughout the draft guidance that information gathering on device materials of construction and the manufacturing process, including chemical additives, processing aids, presence of cohort of concern compounds, etc., can be useful in the development of a device-specific chemical characterization plan and analysis of the resulting data. We agree with FDA on this point, and recognize that a large gap in the industry may be stemming from the fact that a Biological Evaluation Plan/Report (i.e., BEP/BER or Biological Risk Assessment) per ISO 10993-1 is not required for the majority of FDA pre-market submissions. We have already seen trends in which FDA has started asking for more material, supplier, and manufacturing information in 510(k)s, submissions for which FDA historically did not require this information to be submitted by the sponsor. We have concerns that FDA's expectations related to chemical identification levels may be unattainable even despite proper information gathering and additional orthogonal data and represent an unwillingness to accept some residual level of uncertainty in their decision-making process.\n- In several places in the draft guidance, FDA illustrates that non-targeted chemical analysis is needed for general screening of unspecified device extractables, but that subsequent use of targeted analysis may be necessary to confirm the identity or refine the quantity of certain chemicals, including cohort of concern compounds, or analyze extractables with high concentrations. FDA also states that non-targeted data is insufficient to conclude that a particular substance is absent from the device extracts. We have seen cases in which devices with claims of \"DEHP-free\" or \"phthalate-free\" do in fact contain these chemicals in the device extracts.\n- In Appendix A of the draft guidance, FDA provides suggestions on what is and is not considered \"worst case\" for the test articles used for testing. FDA suggests that test articles represent the worst-case manufacturing process, and provide the examples that the device undergoes the greatest number of sterilization and/or reprocessing cycles. It is common that sponsors will perform, for example, testing on 2x EO sterilized devices in order to support manufacturing scenarios in which the device needs to be re-sterilized. However, reprocessing (cleaning and disinfection and/or sterilization) is typically performed by the end user in a healthcare facility rather than part of the manufacturing process. FDA's suggestion to test the maximum reprocessing cycles for reusable devices is aligned with the recommendations in clause 4.8 of ISO 10993-1:2018, but is extremely burdensome and not referenced in the related ISO 10993-18. We have already seen trends for FDA to request biocompatibility and other testing after maximum reprocessing cycles of each separate reprocessing scheme listed in the sponsor's labeling, including all combinations of detergent and disinfection chemistries, manual vs. automatic washing methods, sterilization modalities, and different sterilizer cycles/parameters for the same sterilization modality. As many reusable devices can undergo hundreds or even thousands of cycles, the combination of testing the maximum cycles for each of these variables is extremely time-consuming and cost prohibitive, costing many hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. In addition, the recommendation to test the device after maximum reprocessing cycles appears counterintuitive to the other recommendations in the guidance, which focus on the toxicological concern of chemical additives or manufacturing process aids, including cohort of concern compounds, present on the device that can be extracted. These chemicals would typically have decreased quantities over the lifetime of a reusable device due to being removed by multiple cycles of reprocessing. Therefore, FDA's justification for this burdensome approach is not clear.\nGiven the current frustrations with chemical assessments and desire to reduce animal tests, the release of the draft guidance is a step in the right direction. However, additional guidance from FDA is necessary in the related areas of simulated use and release kinetics studies. In order to be more helpful to industry, reasonable recommendations to reduce animal testing in practice (rather than theory) are still needed. It is recommended to submit a Pre-Submission to the Agency when considering your chemical characterization strategy, especially for any devices/materials with special considerations or use of alternative strategies and solvents.\nFDA is [extending the comment period](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-10-22/pdf/2024-24447.pdf) on the notice\npublished September 20, 2024 ([89 FR 77162](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-09-20/pdf/2024-21575.pdf)).

    "text": "The best exercises to tone your legs – no weights required Your legs support you every single day. So it makes sense that so many of us are on the hunt for effective exercises to build strong, toned legs. Leg day has become something of a cultural phenomenon. Seriously, the hashtag #legday has more than [20 billion views on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/legday?lang=en) and over [23 million posts on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/legday/?hl=en). So, where does our obsession with leg day come from? Sometimes, when people want to add leg day into their strength-training program, they have an aesthetic goal in mind. Maybe they want to slim their thighs, get a [peachier backside](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-butt-exercises-rcna39297) or [tone their calves](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-calf-exercises-rcna17221). But strong legs do so much more than look good when we're walking around. And you can strengthen your legs with simple workouts that don't require any extra weights. What are the leg muscles? To better understand the benefits that can come from strengthening your legs, it's important to know which muscles leg exercises actually target. The muscles in the legs are some of the largest in the body. They include the quads and [hamstrings](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-hamstring-exercises-rcna17619) as well as the hips, adductors, abductors and calves. And we can't talk about working the legs without also mentioning the [glutes](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-glute-exercises-rcna16804), which are crucial for performing any hip or thigh movement. Each one of these muscles has its own set of parts. Aptly named, the quadriceps are a group of four muscles that help to extend and stabilize the knee and are also vital to movements such as jumping and [running](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-run-properly-rcna47006). In the back of the body, the glutes and hamstrings each include three muscles. The back of the lower leg includes three muscles that are collectively called the calf muscle. The inner leg muscles (the adductors) include four muscles that help you to close your thigh in toward the center of your body, while the outer leg muscles (the abductors) include parts of the glute and other smaller muscles that help open your leg away from the midline of the body. Benefits of leg exercises Our legs are the foundation of the body. Improving strength and muscle mass in the lower body creates a stronger and sturdier base for the body in addition to the core. That's important because we use our [legs](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-hamstring-exercises-rcna17619) and glutes to perform every single movement during the day: standing up, sitting down, bending over, [walking](https://www.today.com/walking-guide) and even getting out of bed. So, incorporating leg workouts into your routine is crucial for maintaining healthy movement in your life and throughout the entire day. Lower-body strength helps us [move faster during cardio activities](https://www.today.com/health/what-fartlek-run-faster-training-technique-t241836), improves agility and balance (fewer trips and falls!), and makes our everyday movements easier and more efficient. How to create an effective leg workout When it comes to creating an effective leg workout, it can be a bit overwhelming since there are hundreds of different exercises that work the lower body. As a personal trainer for almost 15 years, I’ve compiled a list of my top 25 favorite leg exercises that you can do anywhere. Best of all? You don't need any equipment. To incorporate these moves into your workout routine, I recommend picking three exercises and then turning them into a circuit. Perform 10 reps of each exercise and then repeat the circuit for three rounds total. How often should you perform leg exercises? You shouldn't do these exercises every single day. The legs and glutes are the largest muscles in the body, which means you should exercise them — at most — every other day. It's essential to give them at least a 24-hour rest period to recover and restore between workouts. The 25 best bodyweight leg exercises Wall squat Standing against a wall, keep your back straight and your feet hip-width apart. Keep your arms at your sides or on your hips as you slide down the wall, bending at the knees. Bend until your thighs are parallel to the floor. You may have to walk your feet away from the wall so that you are able to form a 90-degree angle at the knee joint at the bottom of the squat. Squeeze your abs and glutes before pressing down through your heels to slide back up the wall to the starting position. Squat Stand with your feet as wide as your shoulders, toes pointing forward. Pull your naval in toward your spine, and then sit back by bending at your knees and reaching your glutes back as if you’re sitting into a chair. Press down through your heels to return to standing. Wide leg open toe squat Stand with your feet open wider than your hips. Turn your toes out. Place your hands on your hips and pull your naval in toward your spine. Tilt your pelvis forward as you bend your knees out to the sides and lower down into a squat. Keep your back flat and your tailbone pointed down toward the ground. Press down through your heels as you stand back up. Squeeze your glutes at the top. Goblet squat Stand with your feet wider than the hips with your toes turned slightly outward. Bring your palms together at your chest with your elbows bent or place your hands on your hips. Pull in your abs and look forward as you reach your hips backward and bend your knees. Lower your butt down slowly until your hips are below your knees. Press down through your heels to stand back up to the starting position. Squat into side leg lift Perform a [squat](https://www.today.com/health/how-do-squats-5-steps-perform-squat-properly-today-t208207). Then, as you stand back up lift the right leg out to the right as high as the hip to work the outer right hip and thigh. Place the foot back down and lower into a squat. Repeat 10 times, then switch to the left side. Reverse lunge Stand with your feet as wide as your hips. Step the right foot back into a [lunge position](https://www.today.com/health/how-do-lunge-properly-not-hurt-your-knees-today-t210726). Engage your abs and lower your right leg down until your knee almost touches the floor. Both knees should be at about a 90-degree angle. Step forward and repeat 10 times before switching sides. Stationary lunge Stand with your feet hips-with apart and your hands in front of your chest or on your hips. Step your left foot back a few feet. This is your starting position. Bend the right knee so that it is over the right ankle and bend your left knee so that the knee reaches down toward the ground. Look in the mirror and make sure your spine stays straight and that you’re not leaning forward. Press down through the front heel to come up to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times, then switch sides. Good mornings Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your hands placed behind your head and elbows out to the sides. Focus on keeping your shoulders back and your core muscles engaged. Take a deep breath in and on the exhale, hinge forward at the hips and lower into an upside-down “L” shape until you feel a slight [stretch in your hamstrings](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/lower-body-stretches-rcna34146). If you feel any pain or uncomfortable pulling, you’ve lowered too far! Slowly raise your torso back into the standing position on your exhale. Walking lunges Start with your feet together. Step forward with your right foot, lunging with your right leg until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Push down through your right heel to come back up to the starting position. This time step forward with the left leg, lowering your left knee toward the floor until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Continue forward with the right leg and continue alternating. Side lunge Standing with your feet as wide as your hips, step your right foot out to the right and perform a lunge by sitting back into the right glute. Reach the right glute backward as you keep the left leg straight. Press down through your right heel as you come back to center. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides. Back lunge & lift Start standing with your feet hips-width apart. Then, step your left foot back and lower down into a lunge. Press down through the right heel to straighten the right leg as you lift the left leg straight up behind you to work the hamstring and glute. Then lower back down into a lunge and repeat 10 times before switching sides. Glute bridge Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor and your arms down at your sides. Tilt your pelvis under and forward, engaging the core, and push down through your heels to lift your hips up toward the ceiling, engaging your glutes. Slowly lower down. Glute bridge with squeeze Lying on your back with your knees bent, reach your fingertips toward your heels so that they can almost touch. Make sure your feet are as wide as your hips, and then slowly pull the naval in toward the spine as you lift the butt, then lower back, then middle back up off of the ground. Hold this position and squeeze the inner thighs in toward each other, release, and then lower back down. Single-leg deadlift Stand with your feet as wide as your hips. Put your weight into your left leg and come up on to your right toe, using it as a kickstand for balance. Begin to hinge at your waist, keeping your left knee soft. Place your hands on your hips for balance. Continue to hinge forward as you slowly lift your right leg up and back until your body forms a straight line from head to toe. Ensure that your hips stay square to the ground. Pause, and then return to the starting position and repeat. Crab walk Start by sitting on the ground with your knees bent and your hands two inches behind you. Have your fingers pointing away from your body. Step your right foot forward as you simultaneously move your left hand forward. Then step your left foot forward as you move your right hand forward. Continue walking forward for a total of 10 reps. Forward leg raises Standing tall, point the right leg out in front of you and squeeze the quad. If you can feel your thigh tighten, that means you’re doing this correctly. Then lift the leg up as high as your hip and slowly lower it back down. Calf raises Standing upright with your feet as wide as your hips, simply come up on to your tip toes and then lower down. Skaters Start standing tall with your feet hips-width apart. Then, as you step or hop to the right, use the left foot to tap behind the right foot. Begin to swoosh your arms like an ice skater to build momentum and help with balance. Then step to the left and bring the right foot behind to tap the floor as you swoosh your arms. Straight leg kickback Stand tall and shift your body weight to your right leg. Lift your left leg straight back while you contract the glute, raising it to about a 45-degree angle from the standing leg. Slowly lower the leg back down and perform 10 reps on this side. To switch sides, shift your body weight to your left leg, and raise your right leg back and up. Calf raises in a “V” position Stand tall with both feet shoulder-width apart and turn your toes outward so your feet create the letter \"V.\" Place your hands on your hips. Press down through your toes and raise your heels as high as you can off of the ground. Slowly lower back down. Curtsy lunge Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Take a step back on your right leg, crossing it behind your left leg, just as if you were about to curtsy. Keep your weight in your left foot and slowly bend your knees, lowering your body straight down. Hold for a moment and then slowly return to the starting position. Perform to the left side. Continue alternating side to side. Lying side leg raises Lie down on one side with legs straight out at a slight angle from your torso and your feet stacked on top of each other. Prop your torso up with your forearm. Lift your top leg toward the ceiling in a slow and controlled movement. Point your toes to fully engage the leg. Lower it back down. Repeat 10 times and then repeat on the other side. Standing hamstring curl Standing with your feet as wide as your hips. Bend the right knee and pull your heel toward your glute by engaging the the back of the right leg. Place it down. Repeat 10 times, then switch legs. Mountain climbers Begin in [plank position](https://www.today.com/health/how-do-plank-right-way-without-back-pain-today-t209122), keeping your back straight, hips low and core engaged. Bring your right knee under your chest toward your right elbow. Bring your leg back to plank position, bringing your left leg under your chest toward your left elbow. Continue alternating your legs, keeping a steady pace. Side shuffle Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart in a half-squat position. Lift your right foot and push off with your left to move your body to the right. Continue to shuffle in this direction for 10 steps, then switch directions and shuffle back 10 steps to the left.

Doug McCraw, a Florida-based hypnotist-comedian who has been part of [Sun Bowl week](/story/sports/college/football/2023/12/26/notre-dame-football-defensive-tackle-howard-cross-iii-looks-to-2024-sun-bowl-alabama-new-york-giants/72023050007/) for years, entertained the gathering at Wednesday night’s team dinner for the Irish and 21st-ranked Oregon State. “(Wednesday) night was pretty unique,” Freeman said at Thursday’s joint news conference . “I’ve never been to a hypnotist. I woke up in the middle of the night kind of Googling: ‘Is this real or not?’ That’s was the first time I’ve ever been to one of those shows.” Commentary: [Sun Bowl in El Paso the place to be for Notre Dame football](/story/sports/college/football/2023/12/28/sun-bowl-and-el-paso-shine-on-notre-dame-football-vs-oregon-state-friday-analysis-kickoff-time-tv/72039641007/) Mike Denbrock: [Marcus Freeman used direct pitch to bring LSU offensive coordinator back to Notre Dame football](/story/sports/football/2023/12/28/notre-dame-football-coach-marcus-freeman-talks-mike-denbrock-hiring-lsu-cincinnati-sun-bowl/72049444007/) After telling the crowd at the Fort Bliss, a sprawling U.S. Army base, that one hour of hypnosis is as refreshing as eight hours of sleep, McCraw asked for volunteers from both teams to join him on stage. One of McCraw’s routines involves telling the entire crowd to close its eyes and then, upon his command, “forget the number four.” Sure enough, when the crowd was asked to count to five on its fingers, participants repeatedly skipped right from “three” to “five.” In Notre Dame’s case, both players wearing No. 4 this season (receiver Chris Tyree and safety Antonio Carter II) entered the transfer portal in December. Sixth-year receiver Matt Salerno, who typically wears No. 29, did switch to No. 4 for the final game of his college career. At 9-3 and seeking to avoid loss No. 4 for a second straight season under Freeman, it wouldn’t be the worst thing for the Irish if McCraw’s spell lasted through Friday’s contest.
