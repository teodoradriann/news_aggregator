    "text": "The Gola rainforest in West Africa, a biodiversity hotspot, is home to more than 400 species of wildlife, including endemic and threatened species, and more than 100 forest-dependent communities living just outside the protected Gola Rainforest National Park and dependent on the forest for their livelihoods. In the last few decades, logging, mining, poaching and expanding agriculture have driven up deforestation rates and habitat loss for rainforest-dependent species, prompting a voluntary REDD+ carbon credit program in 2015 to incentivize conservation and provide alternative livelihoods. One activity under the REDD+ project is shade-grown cacao plantations, which provide a wildlife refuge while generating income for cacao farmers in the region. Independent evaluations have found that the REDD+ program has slowed deforestation, increased household incomes, and avoided 340,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually — all while enjoying support from local communities. In eastern Sierra Leone, straddling the border of Liberia, lies Gola Rainforest National Park, one of the last remaining intact tracts of the tropical Upper Guinean forests in West Africa. Towering trees with massive buttress roots create a dense, emerald-hued canopy where monkeys hoot, malimbes chatter and hornbills flutter between the branches with their high-pitched honks and impressive wingspans.\nAlong the park’s fringes, 122 communities own small patches of the jungle within the four-kilometer-wide (2.5-mile) buffer zone. In the past, people here relied on these community forests to harvest timber and other forest produce, hunt for bushmeat and grow staple crops.\nIn the 1900s, logging and mining intensified in the region’s forests, including the area that would become Gola Rainforest National Park. People cut down large swaths of trees in the buffer zone to grow cash crops like oil palm and cacao, from which chocolate is made. Poaching and encroachment in the forest increased during Sierra Leone’s civil war in the 1990s and into the early 2000s, further threatening the rainforest and its wildlife. According to a 2017 geospatial analysis published by Purdue University in the U.S., such activities led to massive deforestation, with the Gola community forests losing more than 4% of their tree cover annually between 1991 and 2016.\nGola Rainforest National Park sits on Sierra Leone’s border with Liberia and protects one of the country’s last large tracts of primary forest. In 2013, a carbon credit project was launched in the Gola rainforest to stymie deforestation and provide a sustainable, alternate livelihood for forest-dependent communities. The 30-year project follows the United Nations-backed framework to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) by managing forest resources sustainably and enhancing forest carbon stocks. Companies, countries and other entities can purchase carbon credits through the program and use them to offset their emissions and meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, which aims to slow global warming enough to thwart its worst effects. In return, the forest-rich, low-income tropical countries receive monetary benefits for conserving their forests and safeguarding biodiversity.\nThe 30-year Gola REDD+ carbon project began as a collaboration between the U.K.’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which has been working in Gola since the 1980s; the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone (CSSL), one of the country’s oldest conservation organizations; and the government of Sierra Leone. Their joint venture, the Gola Rainforest Company–Limited by Guarantee (GRC-LG), sells carbon credits and works with the forest-edge communities — the project’s beneficiaries — to enact conservation measures.\nGola rainforest: A biodiversity hotspot Spanning more than 740 square kilometers (286 square miles), about twice the size of the U.S. city of Detroit, the picturesque Gola rainforest teems with life. More than 60 threatened species, including many endemic to the Upper Guinean forests, call these forests home.\n“It is one of the richest biodiversity areas in the world,” says Fiona Sanderson, a principal conservation scientist at the RSPB who has studied the biodiversity of the Gola rainforest for more than a decade.\nThe rainforest harbors a dozen primate species, including Diana monkeys ( Cercopithecus diana ) and western red colobus monkeys ( Piliocolobus badius ), more than 300 species of birds, including endemic rufous fishing owls ( Scotopelia ussheri ) and yellow-casqued hornbills ( Ceratogymna elata ), and a dizzying array of butterflies. The forest is also a refuge for western chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes verus ), African forest elephants ( Loxodonta cyclotis ), pygmy hippos ( Choeropsis liberiensis ) and giant pangolins ( Smutsia gigantea ) — all of which are threatened.\n“Some of them are fantastic specimens of nature [and] they are very, very attractive,” says Sierra Leonean conservation biologist Hazell Shokellu Thompson. “If we lose the Gola forest, we will certainly lose quite a number of these animals and birds in this region, not only from Sierra Leone but also from West Africa.”\nAfrican forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Image by Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay. The rainforest stores some 19 million metric tons of carbon, and the REDD+ project is expected to result in emissions reductions of around 550,000 tons of CO2 per year. “It is a large tract of rainforest that is acting as a huge carbon sink,” Thompson says. “It is important for avoided emissions [and] for our battle against climate change.”\nThe REDD+ program aims to trade this stored carbon to save the rainforest and its impressive biodiversity.\nForest-friendly cacao: Reviving livelihoods and protecting forests A major component of the Gola REDD+ project is establishing forest-friendly cacao plantations within the buffer zone around the national park. Although not a native species to the region, cacao has been grown in Sierra Leone since the British colonial era and is a crop that farmers rely on for income. Nearly 70% of the world’s cacao comes from smallholders in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, where large swaths of forests are cut down to make way for monoculture plantations.\nIn partnership with the RSPB, the Gola REDD+ project encourages farmers to grow shade-loving cacao under the canopy of native rainforest trees such as Ivory Coast almond and African teak (iroko). Cacao relies on native insects, bats and birds for pollination and pest control.\nAccording to the RSPB, 2,587 farmers living in the forest fringes cultivate more than 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of forest-friendly, shade-grown cacao as part of the REDD+ project. In 2020, 44 metric tons of cacao was grown in these farms. Apart from cacao, farmers also grow kola nuts, coffee and vegetables.\nResearch suggests cocoa crops produce higher yields if grown under the canopies of rainforest trees. Image by Fiona Sanderson. These agroforestry patches don’t just provide food and income for forest communities — they also act as corridors and habitat for wildlife in areas that would otherwise be cleared for conventional agriculture, according to the RSPB.\n“What we are trying to do is flip it on its head,” Sanderson says of the forest-friendly cacao plantations. “It creates a kind of forest-like structure with the same native trees.” She says that more than 100 native tree species are found in these agroforestry plots, and nearly half of them have potential economic value — a key driver for agroforestry .\nThe cacao plantations are also a haven for wildlife, according to researchers. A study conducted by Sanderson and colleagues and published in Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment in 2022 recorded more than 140 bird species in Gola’s shade-grown cacao plantations, of which nearly 60% were forest-dependent species such as hornbills. Many plantations had more native species than the threshold required for sites to qualify as Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas — a designation given by BirdLife International that signifies the potential of a site for bird conservation. Chimpanzees, monkeys and forest elephants also venture into the cacao plantations to raid crops, much to the chagrin of local farmers.\nAs a cash crop, cacao generates revenue for farmers. However, access to better-paying markets hasn’t been easy. As part of the Gola REDD+ project, the GRC-LG has set up cooperatives within the communities where farmers, as members, can sell their beans at a premium. The beans are then exported to international markets, where their selling price is higher than what the middlemen visiting the communities offer. Through the cooperatives, farmers receive training on best practices to improve cacao yields and adopt forest-friendly cultivation practices.\nA farmer in a Gola community works in a shade-grown cocoa plantation. Image by Michael Duff. “Forest-friendly cacao is quite a unique program because it is encouraging shade-growing cacao by providing a premium or a bonus for farmers [which] incentivizes them to be a part of the program,” says social scientist Natasha Constant at the RSPB. She says preliminary results indicate cacao production contributes to 69% of farmers’ incomes. “The merit in [shade-grown cacao] is that … the income generated through agroforestry cacao can be almost twice as high as that of monoculture.”\nBenefits galore for forest-edge communities Since the inception of the Gola REDD+ project, the GRC-LG has partnered continuously with the seven Gola chiefdoms and their member forest-edge communities in the spirit of obtaining free, prior and informed consent, as enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). According to GRC-LG representatives, paramount chiefs and the communities that are part of the REDD+ benefit-sharing agreement have the final say in how the funds are used.\n“During the development of the REDD+ carbon project, we went into community consultation, participatory meetings and assessment,” says Fomba Kanneh, who heads the GRC-LG and who grew up in a Gola forest-edge community. “We did [a] need[s] assessment with all the communities — looking into the historical profile of the area and what they used to do before the commencement of the program.”\nAs a result of these consultations, the Gola REDD+ project was expanded to provide scholarships, uniforms and books for students, set up a savings-and-loan scheme for women-owned small businesses, invest in building schools and hospitals, and provide training for farmers to increase their crop yields so they don’t have to slash and burn additional patches of the forest to feed their families. Growing forest-friendly cacao was also a choice the communities made.\n“Before the REDD+ project, communities were involved in mining, logging and poaching for money, but now it is hard to access these resources,” Kanneh says. “So, the communities have agreed to develop a beneficiary agreement that pays a royalty for conservation.” Kanneh adds that the GRC-LG has 56 rangers who regularly monitor and patrol the park for deforestation, logging, poaching, mining and other illegal activities.\nA member of the Malema Cocoa Farmer’s Association weighs his cacao produce at the cooperative. Image by Michael Duff. Sheku Kamara, executive director of the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone, says the project links conservation to livelihood. “The dependency on the forest is for people to get their livelihood. So if you can provide them something of an alternative, where they can increase their income, they will be less dependent on the forest,” he tells Mongabay. “Livelihood is a tool that we use in conservation.”\nThese principles have translated into results, according to a recently published 2024 study in Nature Sustainability that found that in its first five years, the Gola REDD+ project reduced the average annual deforestation rate in the buffer zone by 30% compared to areas that weren’t part of the REDD+ project. This reduction in deforestation translates to 340,000 metric tons of avoided CO2 emissions.\n“We’re not removing deforestation [through the REDD+ project]; we’re just reducing it,” study co-author Maarten Voors, an economist at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands and who is not affiliated with the Gola REDD+ project, tells Mongabay. He attributes this reduction to forest-friendly cacao plantations. “To a large extent, they’re not clearing the dark green stuff — the important trees, the big ones that have sequestered a lot of carbon — they’re leaving those aside and doing other activities.”\nThe study also found that the reduction in deforestation didn’t affect people’s incomes. “We didn’t see win-win, but we saw a win-no loss,” Voors says.\nA small cocoa plantation coexists with rainforest in the Gola region. Image by Fiona Sanderson. The Gola REDD+ project isn’t without its challenges. Kamara tells Mongabay the carbon credit market tends to be volatile and can impact the revenues generated for the communities. Bringing together over more than 100 communities with different priorities and needs requires years of hard work, trust and transparency in benefit-sharing. Shashi Kumaran, head of sustainable financing at the RSPB, says imparting financial literacy to farmers to manage their cacao farm business can be challenging. Cacao yields, although promising, can vary, pushing farmers to resort to more lucrative but forest-harming activities like logging, according to the RSPB’s Sanderson. She adds that deforestation in the buffer zone can spike during periods of economic instability, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite these challenges, those involved in implementing the Gola REDD+ project say they see a bright future for it because the communities see the benefits and appreciate the efforts put in by the different partners.\n“You don’t have conservation without people, and we want a landscape that delivers for everyone because the communities living within them are absolutely [an] integral part of the landscape,” Sanderson says.\nBanner image: A western red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius) by user peterichman via Wikimedia Commons ( CC 2.0 ).\nSee related:",

    "title": "AI craze is driving Nasdaq’s best run since 1999",
    "text": "A banner year for stocks is drawing to a close, with gains in Big Tech leaving the market near all-time highs amid exuberance for artificial intelligence and dovish bets on the Federal Reserve’s next moves. In the run-up to the final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq marched toward its best year since 1999 amid a $7 trillion surge. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching a record and was roughly 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833. “If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak and Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year – when a lot of people are adjusting their investment game plans – it tends to exacerbate the rally.” In a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets that the Fed is done with its hiking campaign – and will start easing policy in 2024 – global bonds are set for their biggest two-month gain on record. On Thursday, the S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 – extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007. From Nvidia to Microsoft, the seven largest U.S. tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq is up 55% this year. The “Magnificent Seven” – which also includes Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Tesla – are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building. “Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.” Investors have flocked to Big Tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength. Those bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels – but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades. Although there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index. “This leads one to question whether the leaders (or laggards) continue to lead (lag) in the year ahead,” the Bespoke strategists said. “Looking at the past, the picture is not exactly favorable for that sort of rotation in either direction.” The market is “sitting on big gains,” and most participants just want the year to end to register those gains, said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter. “But I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that when everyone seems to be leaning on one side of the proverbial canoe, it pays to move to the middle.” Warnings about a market that’s flashing overbought signals have been raising concern about a pullback, with some market observers saying that traders have gone too far, too fast in pricing in a dovish Fed pivot. While the recent ebbing of inflation is positive for the Fed, some other figures showing economic resilience could fuel consumer spending – working against the central bank’s aim to slow the pace of growth. That poses risks for the bond market heading into the new year. Falling yields have also driven the dollar lower in 2023, with the greenback on pace for its worst year since the onset of the pandemic. Much of the decline materialized in the fourth quarter on growing wagers that the Fed will sharply loosen policy next year. The drop in Treasury yields has effectively relaxed financial conditions in the U.S. and is “hardly compatible with sustainably low inflation,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “The rally in the sovereign space looks overdone – hence the rally in stocks and the selloff in the U.S. dollar look overstretched,” she wrote in a note. About a week ahead of the all-important U.S. jobs report, traders were unfazed by data showing initial jobless claims rose to 218,000. Economists forecast a still-healthy 170,000 increase in December payrolls, consistent with resilient labor demand that has been key in powering the economy.

La buena noticia es que el 26 de diciembre marcará el retorno de Seong Gi-hun, el personaje principal interpretado por Lee Jung-jae, dando inicio a una nueva fase de este mortal juego.

A su alrededor, las sombras de los demás competidores parecen acechar, mientras que un paquete de regalo, adornado con un lazo rosa, resalta en el centro.

Par le biais d'un ami, j'ai contacté le curé de la paroisse de Bisinchi, qui, par la grâce de Dieu, m'a accordé la possibilité de le faire. Dans quel état d'esprit vous trouvez-vous ? Je suis serein et en même temps, je ressens une certaine adrénaline qui me conforte dans ma décision. La croix, le poids des chaînes… Avez-vous peur de souffrir physiquement ?

    "text": "An Israeli military spokesperson reported that Hizbollah had fired multiple missiles at a church in northern Israel, injuring nine soldiers and two civilians. “Hizbollah is committing war crimes by indiscriminately attacking places”, he contended. “Hizbollah is trying to drag the country of Lebanon and the region into this war that Hamas started. If Hizbollah continues, they will bear the consequences and the responsibility for the outcome: an unnecessary war aimed at fulfilling an ISIS ideology, that could bring unwanted destruction to the people of Lebanon in this war… We are preparing for all scenarios should a diplomatic solution not be found to Hizbollah’s constant violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701”. Throughout the day, Hizbollah claimed responsibility for several strikes at Israeli targets near the border. The Israeli military struck the origins of the launches, in addition to Hizbollah infrastructure; four individuals were killed, including two Hizbollah fighters.\nReceive the best source of conflict analysis right in your inbox.\nThis site uses cookies.

    "title": "Cat found on Toronto Pearson Airport runway 3 days after going missing | CP24.com",
    "text": "Kevin the cat has been reunited with his family after enduring a harrowing three-day ordeal while lost at Pearson International Airport earlier this week. The grey-coloured British shorthair arrived on an Air Transat flight from Glasgow, Scotland on Sunday morning, but when the cat’s owner went to pick it up in the baggage claim area, Kevin was nowhere to be seen. “It was such a heartbreak,\" Whitby resident Jackie Winterfield told CP24.com. “We had no idea if he was dead or alive.\" The feline in question belongs to Winterfield’s 22-year-old daughter, Emily, who had been living abroad for the last three years. Winterfield said that once she got off the plane Emily went to grab her cat from the baggage claim area but “found (the carrier) empty on the baggage carousel.” For the next six hours, Winterfield's daughter scoured the airport for Kevin, but eventually went home empty-handed and distraught, she said. Then, early Wednesday morning, the family got a call from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), which manages Pearson: Kevin had been found and turned into the Canada Border Services Agency. It is not clear where the cat spent the previous 72 hours, but Winterfield told CP24.com that an agent informed her that the animal had been found on the runway. Winterfield said Kevin was returned to them hungry, thirsty, tired, and covered in black soot, but she noted that after a good bath, a long nap, and some food and water he seems to be fine. “It’s a mostly happy ending,” Winterfield said. In a statement provided to CP24.com, Air Transat said that they “regret the unfortunate mishap that occurred during Kevin's journey from Glasgow to Toronto.” “Air Transat takes the care and safety of all transported pets very seriously, and we deeply sympathize with the distress this has caused Kevin's owner, spokesperson Bernard Côté wrote in an email. “We want to assure you that our team did everything possible to locate Kevin once we were notified of his escape.\" Issues began before takeoff: mother Winterfield said their troubles with Air Transat began before the flight departed Scotland. The Whitby mother said her daughter had gone out of her way to ensure the cat made it back home to Canada safely, going so far as to buy a special soft-sided carrier and pre-paying for the pet to ride next to her in the cabin. However, on the day of travel, she said that the airline refused to allow the animal inside the cabin of the aircraft citing “an issue with the carrier.” Instead, Kevin was offered a spot in the cargo bay, she said. Winterfield said that her daughter’s partner had to hurriedly purchase a new, hard-sided carrier for Kevin before the flight took off. They were also charged an additional 200 British pounds at that time, she said. “It was so ridiculous,” said Winterfield. “It’s just shocking to see how negligent this airline can be.\" The family says they have since spoken with a lawyer and are considering taking legal action. According to the GTAA, “travelling pets” are welcome at Pearson. Spokesperson Fabrice de Dongo offered the following advice for owners: “While their transportation is the responsibility of each airline, we remind passengers that, for their safety and comfort, pets must be kept inside their carriers at all times. We also ask travellers to let their airline know - when they are booking their flight - that they plan to travel with their pet,” he wrote in a statement provided to CP24. “With all the necessary information in hand, each airline will be able to advise on the size of carrier needed, as well as any required travel documents. … Again, Air Transat and/or individual airlines are best placed to speak to their policies and guidelines.”",
