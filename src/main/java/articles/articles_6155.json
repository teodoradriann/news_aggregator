    "text": "Cement Recycling: Paving the Way for a Circular Economy in Construction [Add a Comment](/article/cement-recycling-paving-way-circular-economy-construction#disqus_thread) Ibon Iribar, Investment and Open Innovation Advisor at Cemex Ventures, calls for construction industry investment in reusing and recycling cement. As cities rise and skylines stretch ever higher, the world’s hunger for cement – the backbone of modern infrastructure – is set to soar. By 2030, the demand for this critical building material is expected to surge, fueled by the rapid pace of urbanisation and the construction boom in emerging economies. In [2022](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/09/cement-production-sustainable-concrete-co2-emissions/), global cement manufacturing produced 1.6 billion metric tonnes of CO2, accounting for about 8 per cent of the world's total emissions. What’s more, estimates suggest that cement production could grow by up to [23 per cent](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/cement-and-concrete-companies-leading-the-net-zero-transition/) over the next two decades. Builders rely on cement as a key component of concrete, which is the second most widely used material after water. With global concrete production expected to grow from 14 to 20 billion cubic metres by mid-century, rising urbanisation and infrastructure demand could drive CO2 emissions from the sector to 3.8 billion tonnes annually. These figures highlight the significant impact that building materials have on the global carbon footprint. One of the most effective ways to meet production demands is through cement recycling. Reusing and recycling cement not only saves on raw materials but also reuses materials that would otherwise end up in landfills. This shift supports the construction industry's transition toward a circular economy, which offers both environmental and economic benefits. A circular construction economy In the traditional \"take, make, dispose\" model, resources are extracted, used, and discarded as waste. For instance, carbon prices in the European Union are projected to nearly reach €100 per tonne of CO2 – a level that could become standard by [2030](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/concrete-cement-circularity//). Additionally, landfill costs for construction and demolition waste (CDW) will likely continue affecting the entire building industry, with prices potentially hitting €150 per tonne. Considering global average prices for CO2 and landfills, these costs could total around €210 billion by 2050. However, a variety of forces are making the construction industry shift toward a more circular economy - one that focuses on sustainability and resource efficiency. Cement recycling involves creating closed-loop systems in which materials like recycled concrete are consistently reused and repurposed, extending their lifespan. With over [35 per cent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8745857/#:~:text=According%20to%20this%20definition%2C%20C&D,in%20landfills%20annually%20%5B4%5D.) of construction waste ending up in landfills annually, this circular economy approach offers a powerful alternative to the traditional model by promoting sustainable reuse. A telling example of this shift is Regenera, a company that specialises in repurposing construction, demolition, and excavation waste to create value-added products. One of the company’s key projects is transforming old concrete into smaller pieces, such as crushed stone and gravel, which can then be reused in new construction. These materials are ideal for applications like base layers for roads or even mixed into fresh concrete, reducing the need for new raw materials and minimising waste. By turning what would have been waste into valuable materials, Regenera is not only reducing landfill use but also helping to conserve natural resources. Recycling also provides financial benefits. For example, Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation (PennDOT) has shown how concrete recycling can lead to substantial financial savings. By reusing recycled concrete in road construction projects, PennDOT achieved cost reductions of [up to 27 percent](https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/Bureaus/BOPD/2017_QAW/GeoTech_and_Aggregates/RecycledConcreteAggregates_Snyder.pdf). These savings stem from lowering the need for new raw materials and cutting transportation expenses, making the process not only environmentally sustainable but also economically beneficial for the state. Implementation challenges One major challenge to implementing and scaling cement recycling efforts lies in the decentralised nature of the construction industry. Construction involves a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, suppliers, and local contractors, which means that achieving a circular economy requires widespread collaboration. While these stakeholders are gradually becoming more aligned on the advantages of cement recycling, fragmented supply chains and varying regulations across regions complicate these efforts. In my eight years of experience in construction and implementing sustainable cement recycling programs, I’ve observed that despite progress in stricter regulations and the increased adoption of circular practices, the transition remains slow in the absence of a coordinated industry-wide approach. Although some businesses are embracing these changes, scaling cement recycling to an industry-wide level will require a unified commitment. One of the most significant challenges businesses face is the substantial initial investment required for implementing recycling technologies, including infrastructure and training, which has often led to pushback. However, my message to these companies is simple: these initial expenses are dropping quickly as innovative technologies continue to emerge, and government incentives for sustainable practices increase. This combination is making it easier for companies to adopt recycling processes and realise long-term savings, both environmentally and financially. Moving forward In the long term, the return on investment for these efforts will far outweigh the initial cost. Businesses that invest now not only benefit from the lower material and disposal costs that come with a circular economy, but they will also position themselves as leaders in sustainability. This competitive edge can lead to securing more contracts, especially as clients and governments increasingly prioritise eco-friendly practices. In my view, cement recycling is more than just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in the way the industry operates.

    "text": "Aves y peces dan vida a Coña Coña y alistan el inicio de Playa Turquesa\nDesde hace dos años, la Alcaldía proyecta la construcción de una Playa Turquesa en la laguna de Coña Coña, un importante vaso regulador en Cochabamba. Se prevé el inicio de los trabajos en los próximos días. En tanto, decenas de aves llegaron a embellecer este atractivo natural de la zona oeste de la ciudad.\n“Ya está listo el proyecto. Vamos a hacer un trabajo directo con Emavra (Empresa Municipal de Áreas Verdes y Recreación Alternativa). En no más de 10 o 15 días ya vamos a iniciar porque queremos terminarlo este año”, declaró hace una semana, el alcalde Manfred Reyes Villa.\nLa laguna de Coña Coña abarca más de dos hectáreas y está rodeada por un parque infantil, una escuela, una pista asfaltada para trotar y andar en bicicleta, y un patinódromo construido para los Juegos Suramericanos. El lugar se alimenta de tres torrenteras del Parque Nacional Tunari: La Pajcha, Pinto Mayu y Taquiña.\nEl proyecto presentado en abril por la Alcaldía incluye la revitalización, limpieza y mejora del entorno de la laguna con nuevas áreas de esparcimiento, canchas deportivas y una playa artificial equipada con arena, palmeras, jatatas y otras características que convertirán el lugar en uno de los principales atractivos de la ciudad, sostuvo.\nNaturaleza\nActualmente, la laguna recibe diversas especies de aves, hay peces y mantiene un nivel de agua que bordea las compuertas, según se constató en un recorrido.\nEl director de Medio Ambiente, Elvis Gutiérrez, informó que sigue ingresando agua y continúan con la limpieza en el espejo de agua y en sus alrededores.\nRollandia rolland, gallareta andina (Fulica ardesiaca), gaviota andina (Chroicocephalus serranus) y pato de pico rojo (Anastasia bahamensis) son algunas de las especies identificadas por el biólogo José Balderrama. Informó que el fin de semana realizará un censo de aves en la zona. Asimismo, señaló que los peces avistados parecen sardinitas del género Asthianax.\nEsperan contrato\nLa Empresa Municipal De Áreas Verdes Y Recreación Alternativa (Emavra) brindará detalles del proyecto de la Playa Turquesa una vez firmado el contrato con la Alcaldía de Cochabamba.\nPrimer Tour Hídrico\nLa Dirección de Turismo invitó ayer a la población a participar, este sábado 6 de julio, en el primer Tour Hídrico para conocer las lagunas Alalay y Coña Coña. Los buses partirán a las 10:00 de la plaza principal. Los cupos son limitados y por orden de llegada.",

    "text": "Saddle up for a trip through entertainment history with a weekly highlight from Santa Clarita’s Walk of Western Stars! This week, “The Duke” himself, John Wayne! Born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, in Winterset, Iowa, the man who would be [John Wayne](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm 78/) moved with his family to Palmdale, California and then later to Glendale, where he would graduate high school. It was in Glendale that Wayne picked up the nickname “Little Duke,” as he never went anywhere without the family’s pet Airedale terrier, Duke. Wayne went on to play football and study pre-law at the University of Southern California (USC), until a broken collarbone led to the loss of his scholarship. It was through this USC connection that Wayne would break his way into the film industry, starting his career as an extra for director John Ford. Ford would direct one of Wayne’s breakout roles in the film [Stagecoach](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/community-news/who-was-buster-trow-unearthing-memories-of-a-forgotten-silver-screen-horse-whisperer-489854) (1939), and the two would go on to collaborate in 14 total movies. In 1999, Wayne was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest male stars in American cinema. Wayne died on June 11, 1979, of stomach cancer. Wayne was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. Where is John Wayne’s Walk of Western Stars plaque? Honored in 1984, and appearing in over 170 films, Wayne remains a cultural icon with his roles as the quintessential American hero, including such films as Iwo Jima (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), and True Grit (1969). Wayne’s plaque on the Walk of Western Stars can be found on Main Street (east side) just south of 8th Street.

    "text": "Crews on Friday continued to gain ground against nearly half a dozen major wildfires burning across California, just as another heat wave descended on the state. The largest of the blazes, the Sites Fire in Colusa County, remained at 19,195 acres and was 30% contained, up from 20% nearly 24 hours earlier, according to Cal Fire. Temperatures in the area neared 100 degrees, and hot and relatively dry conditions were expected to continue into Saturday, the agency said in a situation summary Friday night. The forecast also calls for an increase in southerly winds later in the day. The fire continues to threaten 326 structures. However, with the exception of Sites Ladoga Road from Sites to Ladoga, all evacuation orders have been reduced to warnings. The Post Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the second largest blaze in the state, covered 15,690 acres, a figure that has not changed since Tuesday night. As of Friday night, the fire was 68% contained. Cal Fire said the weekend will bring triple-digit temperatures to the area, along with humidity levels in the teens and winds up to 30 mph. Thunderstorms are also possible Sunday. In Calaveras County, crews increased containment of the 5,351-acre Aero Fire to 67%. The blaze has destroyed three structures and damaged one other; 542 remain threatened. All evacuation orders related to the fire were lifted as of noon Friday, according to Cal Fire. The Point Fire in Sonoma County and the Hesperia Fire in San Bernardino County — the fourth and fifth largest fires in the state, respectively — were approaching full containment. As of Friday night, the Point Fire covered 1,207 acres and was 80% contained, while the Hesperia Fire covered 1,078 acres and was 91% contained. Cal Fire said one firefighter was injured while battling the Point Fire. The fire has also destroyed three structures and damaged two others. Check back for updates.",

    "text": "MADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\nLa lluvia y las tormentas pondrán este viernes en aviso a siete provincias en un día en el que cuatro de ellas alcanzarán el nivel naranja por precipitaciones, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET). En concreto, los avisos naranja por lluvia estarán en Huelva (Andalucía) y Tarragona (Cataluña). Además, Mallorca y Menorca estarán en aviso naranja por lluvias y tormentas.\nPor lo demás, los avisos amarillos por tormenta estarán en Huelva (Andalucía); Tarragona (Cataluña). Además, habrá avisos amarillos por lluvia en Alicante y Valencia (Comunidad Valenciana). Por otro lado, se registrarán avisos amarillos por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza y Formentera (Baleares) y Badajoz (Extremadura).\nEn líneas generales, AEMET prevé que la Península y Baleares continúen bajo la influencia de bajas presiones, con precipitaciones que afectarán al cuadrante sudoeste, sudoeste de Castilla y León, Aragón, Cataluña, Levante y Baleares. Por el contrario, no se esperan precipitaciones o son muy poco probables en el norte de Galicia, Cantábrico, norte de la meseta Norte y alto Ebro. En el resto de las zonas no se pueden descartar.\nLa predicción apunta a que pueden darse chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y/o persistentes en el extremo occidental de Andalucía, y podrían registrarse también en el bajo Ebro y Baleares, y zonas del sur del sistema Central occidental. Mientras, en Canarias, el día será poco nuboso o con intervalos.\nEn lo que respecta a las temperaturas, las máximas estarán en aumento en el oeste peninsular y en descenso en el resto, mientras que las mínimas subirán en el sudoeste y en el área cantábrica. En el resto no se registrarán grandes cambios.\nPor último, AEMET indica que predominarán vientos de componente este en la Península y Baleares, flojos en general en interiores y algo más intensos en litorales, y con posibles intervalos de fuerte en zonas de Cádiz y Baleares. En el archipiélago canariol, soplarán vientos flojos.",

    "text": "The conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has intensified throughout 2024. Rwandan forces and the M23 rebel group have shelled displacement camps near Goma.\nCongolese armed forces and allied militias have also committed abuses against civilians in the area. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous attacks on densely populated areas around Goma.\nThese attacks have killed and injured many civilians, including children. The use of heavy artillery in populated zones violates international humanitarian law.\nOver half a million people have fled to displacement camps surrounding Goma. The total number of displaced people in North Kivu now stands at about 2.4 million.\nThese camps have become targets for indiscriminate shelling by Rwandan and M23 forces. On May 3, a particularly deadly attack struck the 8ème CEPAC displacement site.\nAt least 17 civilians, including 15 children, lost their lives in this incident. The attack involved 122mm artillery rockets launched from Rwandan and M23 positions northwest of Sake.\nHumanitarian Crisis in Congo\nCongolese forces have placed artillery near displacement camps, putting civilians at risk. This has made the camps vulnerable to counterfire from opposing forces.\nAid agencies have reported difficulties accessing the camps due to ongoing military operations. Sexual violence has become a widespread problem in and around the camps.\nBoth Congolese forces and M23 fighters have been accused of raping women. Many victims were attacked while searching for food or firewood outside the camps.\nThe presence of armed men in the camps has led to increased insecurity. Residents have reported killings, lootings, and arbitrary detentions.\nIn some cases, militia members have extorted money from displaced people through threats and violence. Humanitarian aid delivery has been severely impacted by the fighting.\nIn addition, food shortages have forced many displaced people to risk their lives by returning to their fields in contested areas.\nThis has exposed them to further violence and exploitation. International organizations have called for an end to the violations of humanitarian law.\nThey urge both sides to protect civilians and allow unhindered access to humanitarian aid. Sanctions and prosecutions have been proposed for commanders responsible for war crimes.",
