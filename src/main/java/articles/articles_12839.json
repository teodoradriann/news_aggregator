    "text": "Thibaut vous en parlait hier, et c'est déjà fait ! NVIDIA indiquait avoir résolu (à priori) les soucis d'écrans noirs subis par certains acheteurs de GeForce RTX 50, et assurait que des nouveaux pilotes réglant le problème sortiraient avant la fin de la semaine. Nous sommes jeudi et c'est déjà chose faite, puisque voici les GeForce 572.60 WHQL lâchés dans l'arène.\nSi vous subissiez ce souci d'écrans noirs, espérons que vous avez été plus patients que ce pauvre Ron Swanson.\nNVIDIA ne s'étend pas en revanche sur une explication détaillée de la cause de ces écrans noirs et se contente, dans son Release Notes, d'indiquer que trois références d'écrans noirs auraient été corrigés :\n• [GeForce RTX 50 series] Various black screen issues [5088957] [5100062] [5089089]\nCes nouveaux pilotes 572.60 corrigent également quelques autres bugs généraux \"hors jeux\", ainsi qu'un autre lié à l'utilisation de SteamVR, qui pouvait générer des saccades en jeu avec les cartes Blackwell.\nCes 572.60 WHQL apportent également une petite nouveauté sur un jeu sorti en 2021 : NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. Le jeu supporte désormais officiellement le DLSS 4 avec cette nouvelle mouture donc si par hasard vous êtes un inconditionnel de ce titre, ou que cela vous donne envie de vous y essayer avec votre toute fraiche GeForce RTX 50 par exemple, n'hésitez pas à les installer nom de diou, problème d'écrans noirs ou non. Le changelog ne l'indique pas clairement, sûrement un oubli, mais il y aurait également au programme les dernières petites optimisations de rigueur pour le lancement de Monster Hunter: Wilds demain.\nLa page de téléchargement des pilotes graphiques GeForce chez NVIDIA",

    "title": "Ireland weather: Wet and windy weekend ahead as new Met Eireann warnings come into effect",
    "text": "A Status Yellow wind warning will come into effect between 2am to 12pm on Saturday. This weather model shows the strong ‘strong to gale force and gusty’ winds in purple approaching from the south before making their way eastwards across land to Waterford.\nStorm Gerrit may have come and gone, but it appears that the country will continue to experience yet more unsettled weather conditions this weekend in the lead up to the New Year.\nIt had been reported earlier this week that Ireland could be hit by the tail end of Storm Henk which was set to peak out over the Atlantic, but could still “pack a punch” on Ireland, according to weather expert Alan O’Reilly of the Carlow Weather page on X (formerly Twitter).\nThis forecast appears to be coming true for much of the country – the west and the south in particular – as Met Éireann has put Status Yellow rain and wind warnings in place for Friday and Saturday respectively.\nThe national forecaster officially marked the northwestern counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo and North Mayo with a Status Yellow rain warning as heavy rainfall is due with a risk of flooding possible, valid from 6am to 9pm on Friday.\nCarlow Weather’s Alan O’Reilly says that up to 30mm of rainfall is possible over a 24-hour period in these counties in line with the Status Yellow warning.\nA separate Status Yellow wind warning is in place in the south going into Saturday too, as Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford are earmarked to receive “strong to gale force and gusty” winds, leading to potential coastal flooding when coupled with high Spring tides. The warning comes into effect between 2am to 12pm on Saturday.\nMet Éireann’s forecast the weekend is as follows, starting with Friday: “Windy at first this morning with fresh to strong and gusty westerly winds, gradually easing. There will be sunny periods and some showers for much of the country, some of which will be heavy. However, showery rain will persist in parts of the north and northwest for much of the day with some localised flooding likely and a chance of a little sleet in the north too. Highest temperatures of 4 to 8 degrees, possibly a little lower in some northern parts.”\n“Some clear spells at first tonight with just isolated showers. Lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees with some frost and icy stretches forming with light to moderate southwesterly or variable breezes.”\nThe forecast shows a similar outlook for Saturday: “A wet and windy start to the day with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible. The rain will clear to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas through the afternoon.\n“Some showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 9 degrees, coolest in the northwest. Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.”\nSunday – New Year’s Eve – has can expect the following: “Breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail. Fresh to strong and gusty westerly or cyclonic variable winds will gradually decrease moderate to fresh and gusty through the day. Highest temperatures of 6 to 9 degrees generally.”\nNew Year’s Eve revellers in particular will be interested in the Sunday night forecast: “Showers will continue overnight, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of 0 to 4 degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.”\nThe outlook for Monday is: “Sunny spells and scattered showers at first, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon. Cloud will build from the southwest later. Highest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees in light to moderate southwest winds, backing southerly and falling mostly light later.”\nMet Éireann says Tuesday will see outbreaks of rain and drizzle in the south will clear through the morning, becoming dry until night with some showers and highest temperatures of 3C to 6C degrees.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

    "title": "Dallas Cowboys’ Micah Parsons remains frustrated by officiating | NFL | lancasteronline.com",
    "text": "Dallas Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons remains frustrated with he perceives as unfair treatment from NFL officials and continues to voice his displeasure over the lack of holding calls against him. Parsons is one of the league’s premier pass rushers and he joins Hall of Famer Reggie White as the only players in NFL history with at least 13 sacks in each of his first three seasons. But Parsons believes he would have many more than than 13 in 2023 if not what he believes have been obvious holds against them that have not drawn flags. He leads the NFL in quarterback pressures (97) and quarterback pressure rate (23 percent). But Parsons has drawn just two holding calls this season and none since Oct. 16 against the Chargers. He has now gone nine games and more than 36 quarters without a holding call and Parsons has had enough. Parsons has voiced his displeasure on his podcasts and after games. He almost lost his composure in last Sunday’s 22-20 loss to the Miami Dolphins when Parsons was flagged for a questionable roughing the passer penalty but endured a clearer obvious hold and possible hands to the face without a call from the officials. He aired his feelings out on social media and doubled down during a media session on Thursday. Parsons initially tried to down play the lack of holding calls. “It’s been long, you know? And I can say I’ve been to the quarterback quite a lot in that time, so it’s definitely frustrating sometimes,” Parsons said. “But at the end of the day, I kind of understand it comes with the territory.” But the more he talked, the more his true feeling came out. Parsons said the officials simply don’t understand his greatness and can’t treat him like other pass rushers. “To be honest, in the most humblest way ever, I don’t think there’s another rusher like me in the league,” Parsons said. “I don’t think there’s a rusher that runs as quick as I do. There’s not a rusher that does the things that I do. I mean, that’s on tape and I’m pretty sure other rushers can tell you that or whoever. So I think they put me on the same pedestal as other rushers, and we’re just all not the same. “You can’t compare me to a lot of other rushers at all. And how they scheme me versus how they scheme other rushers, it’s just not even the same. I don’t think they take that into [account] at all and I don’t think they realize I’m 4.3 coming off the edge versus some dudes might be 4.4 or 4.5, whatever.” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones came to his defense earlier this week. He said the NFL officials are holding Parsons back. “There’s no question that Micah [Parsons] is having restrictions that, if turned loose, would result in a sack of the quarterback,” Jones said. “They won’t call a holding penalty in a certain range of holding, usually, if they don’t think the player would’ve gotten to the quarterback to begin with. That doesn’t work for Parsons because he’s about to get there almost all the time. Anything that just limits him should be a hold.” Parsons has talked to the officials before and during games and has seen no recourse. What his not going to do is start flopping and failing to draw a call. “I think the refs understand I’m a good player. But they don’t understand the actual plays I can make with my speed and what I can control,” Parsons said. “I just keep it rolling, bro. It kinda is what it is. I’m not a flop guy. I’m not a guy that’s going to fake because I believe I can still make that play. I just got to keep playing through things. It’s adversity. It’s challenges. But I’m just going to keep going forward.” ©2023 Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Visit star-telegram.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
