    "title": "WA Bill Requiring Clergy To Report Child Abuse Dies In House Committee",
    "text": "SEATTLE (WA)\nInvestigateWest [Seattle WA]\nFebruary 22, 2024\nBy Wilson Criscione\nCommittee rejected a compromise with Catholic lobbyists that survivors argued “protects abusers”\nEach of the last two years, Washington state lawmakers on both sides have broadly agreed that clergy should be mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect.\nWashington is one of just five states where that’s not required by law. Democrats and Republicans have repeatedly said, often during deeply personal and emotional debates at the state Capitol, that they want to change that.\nYet for the second year in a row, a Washington bill to make clergy mandatory reporters of child abuse has failed. Senate Bill\n6298, which passed the Senate, died in a House committee this week. The sticking point this session was once again over whether the law should contain an exception to the requirement that would have allowed priests to hide child abuse from authorities if the priest learned of it during a sacramental confession.\nDemocratic Rep. Tana Senn, chair of the House Committee on Human Services, Youth and Early Learning, said the committee would have advanced a bill that didn’t include a compromise for Catholics.\n“It’s by no means an indication that we don’t take child abuse seriously. If anything, it’s the opposite,” Senn said in an interview Wednesday. “We’re taking a strong stand that we don’t want to systemically allow systemic abuse.”\nA division between the Senate and the House regarding confessions doomed the legislation just\nas it did last year, when the House passed a bill with bipartisan support that contained no such exception but the Senate couldn’t agree. The Washington State Catholic Conference, which lobbies on behalf of the state’s bishops, opposed last year’s bill out of concern that it would require priests to break the seal of confession, though the organization supports clergy being mandatory reporters outside of confession.\nThis year’s bill, led again by Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle,\nstruck a compromise to get the Catholic lobbyists to take a “neutral” stance, allowing the bill to pass through the Senate in a 44-5 vote. The compromise would have kept the exemption for confessions. But clergy would still have a “duty to warn” law enforcement or the Washington Department of Children, Youth and Families if they reasonably believed a child was at imminent risk of abuse or neglect, even if that belief comes from information obtained “wholly or in part” from a confession.\nThat way, authorities could check on the child without clergy going into any specifics on what was said during a confession.\nRep. Jim Walsh, a Republican from Aberdeen who considers himself a traditionalist Catholic, opposed eliminating the exception for confessions in previous bills because he believes it infringes on religious freedom. But he applauded the bill’s main sponsor Frame for her work on a compromise.\n“Noel Frame should be given a medal for this. It was a very well-crafted threading of the needle, and I was ready to support it,” Walsh said.\nWalsh was on the House committee where the bill died but blamed a “vocal minority” of Democrats for killing it. In an interview Wednesday, he sarcastically quipped that it failed “because it was too good of a compromise” and “too rational.”\nSenn, D-Mercer Island, said that the debate last year over the bill “was really emotionally difficult on the House floor” and went far beyond party lines, with lawmakers sharing personal experiences of sexual abuse and their own faith.\n“Unless we had ‘Kumbaya’ agreement, I didn’t want to put people through that again,” Senna said.\nFrame is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and has said she’s grateful that the first adult she told about it was a teacher who was a mandatory reporter. She began pushing to make clergy mandated reporters after reading InvestigateWest coverage on sexual abuse\ncover-ups among Jehovah’s Witnesses and learning about Washington’s relatively weak state law regarding clergy reporting requirements.\nFrame has said that while she personally would prefer to see a bill with no loopholes for confessions, she’d rather have any bill that makes clergy mandatory reporters instead of nothing.\nBut advocacy groups and sexual abuse survivors took the opposite stance in a hearing last week. One woman said she was raped by a priest who went on to sexually assault dozens of other girls, calling the compromise a “loophole that protects abusers, not children.”\nTim Law, founder of a nonprofit called the Catholic Accountability Project that aims to protect children from clergy sexual abuse, said\nin a press conference last week that three Catholic bishops in Washington have been subpoenaed by the state attorney general for “abuse-related documents.” (The attorney general’s office hasn’t confirmed or denied any such investigation, and Law has not produced direct evidence of the subpoenas.)\nLaw said he was against any weakened version of a clergy mandatory reporter bill, suggesting lawmakers wait until that investigation is finished.\n“Perhaps the Legislature, then, in light of that report, may have a different view about whether the church is entitled to these privileges,” Law said.\nSenn said the news of a possible investigation into abuses by the Roman Catholic Church in Washington “didn’t help” SB 6298’s chances.\n“I think it might take some time to sit with it. I’m not saying this is never going to happen, but people were not ready to move it forward,” Senn said.\nFrame, however, worries that it’s not realistic to wait for the perfect version of a law mandating that clergy report child abuse and neglect.\n“I think some of my colleagues are not as aware as I am how hard it has been to find this compromise,” Frame said.\nState lawmakers tried to pass similar legislation two decades ago, in the wake of Catholic sexual abuse scandals across the country. But several attempts then also failed amid opposition from Catholic leaders, she noted.\n“Perfect has been the enemy of good for 20 years now,” Frame said.\nWilson Criscione, a lifelong Washingtonian, has reported for various newspapers throughout the state, including the Bellingham Herald and the Inlander. His work has exposed top state officials for ignoring domestic violence, triggered criminal investigations into abusive police and uncovered mistreatment of children in schools and foster care.

    "title": "If you heard these 10 phrases as a child, you grew up with expert manipulators",
    "text": "Manipulation isn’t always loud. It doesn’t always come with yelling or punishments.\nSometimes, it’s subtle. Wrapped in sweetness. Disguised as “for your own good.”\nWhen it comes from a parent or caregiver, it’s especially confusing—because the people you’re supposed to trust are the very ones twisting the truth.\nIf you grew up feeling responsible for their moods, constantly questioning your memory, or bending over backward just to keep the peace… you might’ve been raised by master manipulators.\nAnd more often than not, their tactics showed up in the phrases they used—over and over—until you started to doubt yourself.\nHere are 10 phrases that usually signal you were raised in an emotionally manipulative environment.\n1. “After everything I’ve done for you…” This one doesn’t come from a place of love. It’s not about gratitude—it’s about guilt.\nThe message is clear: You owe me. Always.\nExpert manipulators use this line when they feel challenged. You set a boundary, and suddenly you’re ungrateful. You say no, and they hit you with a list of their sacrifices.\nLove isn’t transactional. But if you heard this phrase growing up, you probably learned to perform to avoid guilt—even when it meant ignoring your own needs.\n2. “You’re too sensitive” This phrase teaches you to second-guess your own feelings.\nYou cry? Overreacting. You feel uncomfortable? Being dramatic. You speak up? You’re “too emotional.”\nIt’s a tool manipulators use to discredit you—especially when they’ve crossed a line.\nInstead of reflecting on their words or actions, they flip the focus back onto you.\nIf you heard this a lot, there’s a good chance you now struggle to trust your emotional instincts.\n3. “Don’t tell anyone what happened” Nothing sends a clearer signal that something’s wrong.\nThis one often comes after a blow-up, a moment of chaos, or even something subtle but unsettling.\nManipulative parents often prioritize image over accountability. They’ll cover their tracks, and you’re expected to play along.\nThat secrecy creates isolation. You learn that telling the truth = betrayal. So you stay quiet—and carry the weight alone.\n4. “You made me do this” This is classic manipulation. And dangerous.\nInstead of owning their behavior, they blame it on yours. They lash out—and then say it’s your fault for “pushing them.”\nIt teaches you that other people’s actions are your responsibility. That if someone hurts you, it must be because you caused it.\nThis belief, left unchecked, can follow you for decades.\n5. “You’re just like your [other parent]” Said with venom, this phrase isn’t about comparison—it’s about control.\nIt’s a way to shame you. To punish you. To weaponize your connection to someone else.\nYou grow up feeling like a reflection of someone they despise. Even if you’re nothing like them.\nIt creates confusion. Identity issues. Guilt for being who you are.\nAnd it usually comes from someone who couldn’t handle their own emotions—so they tried to hand them off to you.\n6. “If you loved me, you’d…” Manipulators are experts at tying love to obedience.\n“If you loved me, you’d keep this secret.” “If you loved me, you wouldn’t make me upset.” “If you loved me, you’d do what I say.”\nThis kind of emotional blackmail teaches kids that love is earned by self-abandonment.\nAnd even now, you might find yourself overextending in relationships—just to feel “good enough.”\n7. “I guess I’m just a terrible parent then” This is the guilt-trip grand finale.\nYou bring up a boundary? They collapse into self-pity. You express a need? Suddenly they’re the victim.\nI remember the first time I pushed back on something my father said—I was probably twelve. Instead of hearing me, he sighed dramatically and muttered, “Well, I guess I’ve failed as a father.”\nI remember standing there, unsure if I was supposed to comfort him or stick to my point.\nThat’s what manipulation does—it makes the child responsible for the adult’s ego.\nAnd it sticks with you long after the moment passes.\n8. “Why can’t you ever make things easier for me?” This one sounds like exasperation, but it’s a pressure tactic.\nIt puts the blame on you for their overwhelm—making you feel like a burden just for existing with needs or boundaries.\nIn healthy families, parents are the buffer. They protect, guide, and reassure.\nIn manipulative ones, the roles flip—and the child becomes the one trying not to “cause trouble.”\nIf you heard this line growing up, you probably still carry a quiet fear of being “too much.”\n9. “You’ll understand when you’re older” Now, in some cases, this phrase is innocent enough.\nBut manipulators often use it as a shield to avoid accountability.\nIt’s code for: “I don’t want to explain myself—but I don’t want to look bad, either.”\nIt ends the conversation. Creates distance. And worst of all, it implies that your current confusion isn’t valid.\nYou grow up feeling like your questions are naive—and that truth is something you’ll never quite be worthy of.\n10. “Everyone else thinks you’re the problem too” Oof. This one cuts deep.\nIt’s not just manipulation—it’s humiliation disguised as consensus.\nBy saying others agree, the manipulator isolates you further. You start to question your reality, your relationships, even your worth.\nWhether or not it’s true doesn’t matter. The goal is to make you feel alone and outnumbered.\nAnd unfortunately, it often works.\nFinal thought If you grew up hearing these kinds of phrases, it’s no wonder you’ve had to rebuild your sense of self from the ground up.\nManipulation doesn’t always scream. Sometimes it whispers in patterns you don’t notice until years later.\nBut here’s the truth:\nYou didn’t make those dynamics happen. You didn’t deserve to be the emotional referee, the scapegoat, or the secret-keeper. And you’re allowed to set boundaries now—even if they weren’t respected then.\nThe more you name the tactics, the more power you take back.\nAnd that’s not rebellion. That’s healing. And it’s long overdue.",

    "text": "L’inverno che non c’è: rischi e conseguenze della neve perduta per la crisi climatica Tra i principali effetti della crisi climatica che stiamo vivendo vi è la netta riduzione della copertura nevosa durante la stagione fredda, a causa del fatto che le temperature più elevate, semplicemente, riducono in modo significativo le probabilità che possa nevicare. In altri termini, il riscaldamento globale è associato a inverni più poveri di neve e dunque a montagne meno imbiancate. A testimonianza di questa condizione vi è una una [foto emblematica dell'Italia scattata l'11 aprile del 2022](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/quanto-e-bella-litalia-vista-dallo-spazio-ma-il-nuovo-scatto-dello-stivale-cela-un-dramma/) dal satellite Sentinel-3A della missione Copernicus, co-gestita dalla Commissione Europea e dall'Agenzia Spaziale Europea (ESA). All'inizio della primavera ci si aspetterebbe uno Stivale ancora largamente innevato, soprattutto sull'Appennino e sulle Alpi, dato che a marzo si verifica il massimo accumulo; ebbene, in questo scatto dallo spazio la neve risulta praticamente assente fino ai 2.400 metri di quota. È una condizione tipica dell'inizio dell'estate, non della fine dell'inverno. A marzo di quest'anno si è verificato un significativo –63 percento nell'accumulo di neve in Italia, come specificato in un'intervista al Sole24Ore dal dottor Francesco Avanzi, ricercatore del CIMA (Centro Internazionale in Monitoraggio Ambientale) e idrologo specializzato in neve. Si tratta di 1/3 in meno rispetto alla media registrata negli anni precedenti e un dato in peggioramento rispetto a quanto visto nel 2022, l' [anno più siccitoso nella storia del Bel Paese](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/il-2022-e-stato-lanno-piu-caldo-e-siccitoso-di-sempre-in-italia-e-andra-sempre-peggio/). Se infatti a marzo 2022 gli esperti contavano 6 miliardi di metri cubi d'acqua (quando solitamente ce ne sono 12-13 miliardi, come spiegato dal presidente del CIMA Luca Ferraris), a marzo 2023 ne sono stati registrati 4 miliardi. A dimostrare che in Italia c'è sempre meno neve anche i dati che arrivano dagli impianti sciistici; secondo il [rapporto “Nevediversa 2023” di Legambiente](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/addio-neve-il-90-delle-piste-italiane-innevate-artificialmente-insostenibile-e-costoso/) la quasi totalità delle piste da sci italiane (90 percento) viene innevata in modo artificiale. In questo contesto di cambiamento climatico l'Italia è il Paese europeo che necessita di più neve artificiale per garantire il divertimento invernale, a discapito della sostenibilità: l'Austria, al secondo posto di questa classifica, ha bisogno di neve artificiale per il 70 percento delle proprie piste, mentre la Svizzera per il 50 percento. Tutti questi dati indicano chiaramente che i nostri inverni sono sempre più poveri di neve, e la situazione continuerà a peggiorare di pari passo con l'esacerbazione della crisi climatica, intimamente connessa alle emissioni di CO2 (anidride carbonica) e altri gas climalteranti di origine antropica. Ma quali sono le effettive conseguenze delle montagne sempre più bianche? Tra le più devastanti vi sono quelle ecologiche. Gli habitat naturali in montagna sono infatti sostenuti da delicatissimi equilibri, nei quali le diverse specie di animali e piante si distribuiscono a quote diverse per occupare per le proprie nicchie ecologiche. Ma col punto di congelamento (0 °C) che sale sempre più di quota anno dopo anno, anche le specie devono “inseguirlo”, ma non tutte ci riescono, andando incontro a una perdita di distribuzione, come evidenziato dallo studio “ [Red-listed plants are contracting their elevational range faster than common plants in the European Alps](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/piante-alpine-braccate-dal-caldo-molte-migrano-piu-in-alto-ma-la-montagna-prima-o-poi-finira/)” pubblicato sulla prestigiosa rivista scientifica PNAS. Il problema principale, tuttavia, risiede nel fatto che le montagne non sono infinite. Le specie, di fatto, non potranno salire più in alto perché il punto di congelamento arriverà oltre la vetta, facendo perdere loro definitivamente l'habitat naturale nel quale si sono evolute per migliaia di anni. Ciò le condannerà a un'inevitabile estinzione. Del resto non hanno tempo e modo di adattarsi ai cambiamenti repentini dettati dalla crisi climatica in accelerazione. Non c'è dunque da stupirsi che le specie montane siano tra le più minacciate in assoluto dal riscaldamento globale. Al di là dell'impatto su flora, fauna e ambiente in generale, gli inverni senza neve hanno molte altre conseguenze negative, anche sociali ed economiche. Senza precipitazioni nevose, infatti, va a ridursi drasticamente il serbatoio idrico che rimpingua i fiumi che scendono a valle, peggiorando ulteriormente l'impatto della siccità, anch'essa catalizzata dalla crisi climatica. Dall'acqua dei fiumi dipendono famiglie e attività economiche (basti pensare all'intero settore agricolo); con portate sempre inferiori si riduce la disponibilità di acqua per innaffiare i raccolti, dar da bere al bestiame e ovviamente quella potabile / sanitaria che arriva nelle case. Il monitoraggio condotto dall'ARPA in Nord Italia all'inizio del 2022 ha evidenziato che [mancavano oltre 2 miliardi di metri cubi d’acqua](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/siccita-e-crisi-climatica-in-nord-italia-mancano-oltre-2-miliardi-di-metri-cubi-dacqua/) nei “grandi serbatoi” della Lombardia, rappresentati proprio dalla neve montana e dai grandi laghi regolati (come il Benaco, il Lario e l'Eridio), oltre che dagli sbarramenti idroelettrici. Tutti ricordiamo le [polemiche innescate dalla necessità di razionare l'acqua](https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/siccita-quali-sono-le-sei-regioni-che-rischiano-il-razionamento-dellacqua-e-cosa-significa/) nelle recenti e roventi estati proprio a causa della cronica carenza di acqua dolce. Emblematiche le immagini del fiume Po in secca, un deserto dal quale sono emersi fossili di animali preistorici e mezzi affondati durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Il problema, ovviamente, non riguarda soltanto l'Italia, ma tutto il mondo; basti pensare lo [scioglimento devastante dei ghiacciai dell'Himalaya](https://scienze.fanpage.it/lhimalaya-perde-ogni-anno-8-miliardi-di-tonnellate-di-ghiaccio-scioglimento-raddoppiato/) – negli ultimi dieci anni il tasso di fusione è aumentato del 65 percento – rischia di avere un impatto drammatico sulla vita di un numero enorme di persone. Dall'acqua che discende dalla catena montuosa, infatti, [dipendono ben 2 miliardi di persone](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/i-ghiacciai-himalayani-si-stanno-sciogliendo-a-un-ritmo-mostruoso-2-miliardi-di-persone-a-rischio/), 240 milioni che vivono sulle montagne e altre 1,65 miliardi a valle. Quando questo bene preziosissimo non sarà più disponibile si innescheranno migrazioni di massa senza precedenti, dato che diventerà impossibile coltivare, allevare il bestiame e in generale vivere in un ambiente dove non scorre più acqua dolce. Senza dimenticare che lo scioglimento di questi ghiacciai potrebbe portare alla luce [virus e batteri mortali](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/lo-scioglimento-dei-ghiacciai-puo-liberare-nuove-specie-di-batteri/) sepolti per millenni sotto uno spessissimo strato di ghiaccio. È un [rischio da non sottovalutare](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/lo-scioglimento-dei-ghiacciai-rilascera-100mila-tonnellate-di-microbi-nellambiente-i-rischi/) poiché non ci siamo evoluti con essi e il nostro sistema immunitario potrebbe non essere adeguatamente preparato. A rendere il tutto ancor più preoccupante, il fatto che la riduzione della copertura nevosa innesca un circolo vizioso amplificando il riscaldamento globale. Il manto candido del ghiaccio e della neve ha infatti una elevatissima albedo, ovvero la capacità di riflettere i raggi solari e quindi avere un effetto raffreddante. La nuda roccia e il terreno libero, d'altro canto, assorbono più calore e a loro volta favoriscono lo scioglimento del ghiaccio circostante e l'aumento della temperatura superficiale dell'aria. L'assenza di neve incrementa anche il rischio di frane e valanghe, come [quella mortale accaduta sulla Marmolada](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/il-crollo-del-ghiacciaio-della-marmolada-e-legato-al-riscaldamento-globale/). La neve, infatti, funge da “stabilizzante” per il terreno e la sua alterazione / diminuzione può favorire l'innesco dei disastri naturali. Gli inverni senza neve caratterizzati da perdita della biodiversità e degli ecosistemi, riduzione delle preziosissime risorse idriche e impatto devastante sulle attività economiche sono ormai una realtà, ma rappresentano solo una frazione delle molteplici conseguenze scatenate dalla crisi climatica in atto.",

On Sunday, May 19, several TikTokers visited Kanyari's church. One of them, Faith Peters, who claimed to have a crush on the preacher, went up to the pulpit and offered Kanyari a gift. PAY ATTENTION: Have Some Fun! Try Our Newest Quizzes and Polls ! When the man of God unwrapped it, he revealed a pack of condoms, a box of tampons and a jar of petroleum jelly. The act, which was captured and widely shared on TikTok , sparked a heated debate among netizens. Many condemned the gesture as inappropriate for a church setting, while others criticised Kanyari for allowing the situation to unfold without intervention. The backlash was intense, with people taking to various social media platforms to express their disapproval. How did Pastor Kanyari respond to the criticism? Consequently, Kanyari took to TikTok to express his frustrations over the situation. He broke down, saying the backlash had left him feeling isolated and depressed. The preacher went on to say that he had been forced to lock himself in his house and even close his businesses. He said he needed people to encourage him and gently correct him when he was wrong instead of just harshly criticising him. In his words: \"Nimejifungia kwa nyumba yangu. leo nimekaa. Hata sijafanya kazi. Nimesema leo hoteli yangu ifungwe nikasema duka zangu zifungwe. Leo that sijapata pesa. Sijaenda hata kwa bank. Hata sina chochote hapa. Ni mtu tu wa TikTok amenitumia KSh 20,000 nikamwambia mi hata sina haja ya pesa nataka tu mtu wa kunipa moyo, mtu wa kuniambia Kanyari don't worry. \"Kwanini mnataka kuniua, si mnirekebishe tu...kama nimekosea si mtu aniombee? Just pray for me.\" Kanyari went on to explain that he was not aware TikToker Faith would gift him condoms. He begged Kenyans for forgiveness , saying had he known what she was up to, he would have asked her off the pulpit. \"Sikuwa na security kanisani...hao mabodyguard mimi siwaekangi. Ndio maana ule msichana akachukua nafasi ile akaja na mipira kwa madhabahu na akaongea hiyo upumbavu. Sikuwa na akili ya haraka ya kusema msichana ondoka hapa,\" he said amid tears.

    "title": "Karnataka govt amends law to collect 10% tax from temples, BJP calls them anti-Hindu",
    "text": "The Karnataka government’s bill which mandates the government to collect tax from Hindu temples has caused a huge political furore in the state. The opposition BJP has accused the Siddaramaiah government of stealing wealth from rich temples in the state. The Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024 was passed in the Assembly on Wednesday, February 21. BJP has now intensified its opposition ahead of the Bill being tabled in the Legislative Council, where coalition partner BJP and JD(S) hold sway.\nThe amendment that the government brought allows the government to collect 10 percent tax from temples that have revenues more than ₹1 crore and 5 percent from those with revenues ranging between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore. Leader of opposition R Ashoka accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of “stealing from temple collection boxes” and alleging that the government was aiming to gain a 10% commission from temple revenues.\nKarnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the allegations appear to be misrepresented for political gain. “There has always been a mandate to create a common pool since the enactment of the Act in 1997. The common pool is administered solely for religious purposes connected with the Hindu religion. The Common Pool Fund has been utilized only for the religious purposes of Hindu institutions since the Act came into force in 2003, and it will continue to be used for the same purposes in the future,” he wrote on X.\nAround 35,000 temples fall under the jurisdiction of the Muzrai department. Among these 205 temples are classified as Group A as their annual incomes exceed Rs 25 lakh. Group B comprises 193 temples with incomes ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 25 lakh per year. The majority of temples, approximately 34,000 temples belong to Group C, income below Rs 5 lakh annually.\nTill now, Group A temples contributed 10% of revenue, Group B temples contributed 5%, and Group C temples made no contributions.\nWith the proposed amendment, temples with incomes above Rs 1 crore: These temples will now have to contribute 10% of their revenue to the Common Pool Fund.\nTemples generating between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore revenue: They are required to chip in five per cent to the fund.\nTemples with incomes below Rs 10 lakh: These temples will not have to contribute to the fund.\nMuzrai Minister Ramalinga Reddy, who introduced the amendments said that the money would be used for providing various amenities to temples, offering insurance coverage and death relief to temple priests and granting scholarships to approximately 40,000 children of priest families. He said, “the funds will be managed by Rajya Dharmika Parishad and will primarily be allocated to provide aid to Group C temples and provide welfare measures to priests and their families at these temples.”\nThe Bill was passed with minimal opposition in the Assembly on Wednesday. But later in the evening, BJP state president BY Vijayendra took to Twitter accusing the Congress government of targeting revenue of Hindu temples to “fill government coffers”. “The government will collect 10% of the income from temples earning over Rs 1 crore, this is nothing but poverty. The offering dedicated by the devotees for the knowledge of God and the development of the temple should be allocated for the renovation of the temple and for the convenience of devotees,” he said.\nIn response, Ramalinga Reddy said that the provision wasn’t new but has existed since 2001 but wasn’t implemented. “Did your BJP government neglect its responsibilities between 2008 and 2013 and 2019-2023? Looks like your government turned a blind eye to the revenues of Hindu temples, despite the existence of the amendment since 2001,” he said.\nThe previous BJP government led by CM Basavaraj Bommai wanted to introduce a law to remove Hindu temples from state control.\nRead:",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
