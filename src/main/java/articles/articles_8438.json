    "text": "The digital asset market has undoubtedly witnessed a bullish surge over the last day. Moreover, it could be set to benefit Cardano (ADA), as one crypto analyst sees the asset eyeing a 20% surge to the end of 2023. Subsequently, the asset would be heading into the new year with renewed momentum. Earlier this week, Cardano was faced with an unexpected drop in value. Indeed, the token saw its price correct and fall to lows of $0.56 on Tuesday. However, it could be set to make a turnaround sooner rather than later. Indeed, the asset is forecasted to enter 2024 on the heels of quite a rally. Also Read: [Cardano (ADA) Rallies 77%, Hits Yearly High: Can It Hit $1 Next?](https://watcher.guru/news/cardano-ada-rallies-77-hits-yearly-high-can-it-hit-1-next) Cardano (ADA) Could Make Surge to $0.7 As 2024 Arrives The year has certainly been a positive one for the digital asset industry. 2022 ended with collapse and struggles, with 2023 set to end amid tremendous optimism over the health of the market. One asset that has seen increased volatility throughout the week could also benefit from similar optimism. Specifically, one analyst has stated that Cardano (ADA) could be facing a 20% surge by the end of 2023. Indeed, [Ali Martinez](https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1740004785217282178?s=20) took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss what could be next for the asset. Especially after its rather shocking price correction this week saw it fall in value. Also Read: [Cardano ADA: Is $1 The Next Milestone?](https://watcher.guru/news/cardano-ada-is-1-the-next-milestone) Specifically, Martinez made note of Cardano’s readings on the four-hour chart. He made note of a symmetrical triangle that was shaping up, which would prepare the asset for a rather stark turn upward. Subsequently, he forecast a lift to the $0.78 price point after a noticeable breakout. Over the last 24 hours, Cardano had increased its price by more than 7%, to trade around the $0.65 level. Moreover, it sported intraday highs of $0.678, after retreating just a bit. Still, the development does paint an optimistic picture following its recovery from Tuesday’s decline. Further solidifying the potential validity of Martinez’s prediction.",

    "text": "- By [Vivek Raj](/authors/vivek-raj) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 01:17 PM (IST) - Source:JND India is setting its sights on launching 50 satellites over the next five years to bolster geo-intelligence gathering capabilities, announced Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman S Somanath announced on Thursday. The ambitious plan includes deploying satellites in various orbits, forming a comprehensive layer with the capacity to monitor troop movements and capture extensive imagery over thousands of kilometers. Somanath made these remarks during 'Techfest,' an annual science and technology event organised by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Expressing the need for a substantial increase in the satellite fleet, Somanath said that India's current satellite capacity is insufficient to realise the nation's goal of becoming stronger and it should be \"ten times what we have today\".

Defence intelligence gathering satellites, also known as 'spy-sats,' play a crucial role in enhancing a country's security. Somanath highlighted the significance of understanding and monitoring activities around the country's borders and neighboring regions.

The chairman highlighted the strategic advantage of launching satellites on a large scale, stating that it enhances the country's ability to mitigate threats effectively. The planned layer of satellites will span from geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) to lower earth orbit (LEO) and very low earth orbit, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of critical situations through various technologies, including optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and thermal imaging. \"We will have communication between satellites so that if some satellite detects something, which is at GEO at 36,000 km, it can have a large view. If you find some activity happening, you can task another satellite in the lower orbit (to check) much more carefully and then give more information,\" he said.

    "title": "Illinois lawmakers moving forward on public defender reform",
    "text": "Illinois\nIllinois lawmakers moving forward on public defender reform\nWhen Elizabeth Pollock took over as the Champaign County public defender in 2022, one of her team’s attorneys was handling 500 cases by herself in a courtroom that should have been staffed by at least three public defenders.\n“That is a recipe for disaster because it’s not just taxing on the attorney, but it means that the client(s) who that attorney is representing are not able to speak with her in a timely fashion; they’re not able to review their cases with her in a timely fashion,” Pollock said in an interview. “We’re talking about months of delay in terms of meeting with attorneys and getting results.”\nWith many county public defender offices pushed to the limits throughout Illinois, state lawmakers are moving forward on legislation to create a statewide public defender office.\nMany public defender offices in Illinois, especially in rural areas, are in desperate need of resources to provide adequate defense services. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1963 on Gideon v. Wainright that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a defense attorney, setting the basis for public defenders that judges often assign to defendants to represent a person for free.\nBy 2022, St. Clair County Chief Defender Cathy MacElroy said her office was “collapsing” beneath the weight of demand. Attorney were leaving the public defender’s office because the pay was too low and the case load too high and she began asking the 20th judicial circuit to allow her office to withdraw from cases. She had no choice, she said.\n“It is not ethically possible for us to provide adequate representation to clients with the amount of cases we have with only five full-time lawyers,” MacElroy said in a 2022 interview with the Belleville News-Democrat.\nEven with $200,000 added to the public defender’s budget by the county board, she worried that bail reforms and additional pre-trial hearings would add to the strain.\nShe wasn’t alone.\nA 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court examined nine counties of varying sizes and found each one lacked necessary resources to provide defendants proper legal representation because of high caseloads, a lack of state oversight and long wait times to obtain a lawyer. A task force created after that report recommended Illinois fully fund public defense services and establish a statewide office that provides administrative oversight and resources.\nDemand for public defense attorneys has increased in the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect in 2023. That law requires more in-depth evidence and arguments during first appearance hearings than under the old bond system, where first appearance hearings often lasted just a few minutes while a judge set a bond. Now detention hearings are required to take place within 72 hours of an arrest, meaning public defender services are often needed right away to review early evidence in cases.\nLegislation in front of the General Assembly would create the “Office of State Public Defender” which would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources. House Bill 3363 passed the House last week on a 72-41 vote. It now heads to the Senate where President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, has tried to pass similar legislation in recent years.\nIllinois has already established similar offices to improve other aspects of criminal court processes, including the Office of State Appellate Defender and the Office of Statewide Pretrial Services.\nFirst steps for the office\nIf lawmakers approve the bill, the office may provide public defense services — but not for several years. Over the first few years, the office’s primary responsibility would be to assess the needs of public defenders in Illinois and collect data about their workloads.\n“We are really lacking any type of data gathering across public defender offices in the state of Illinois because we just have never had the resources to really even count the number of cases that we have,” Pollock said.\nThe data gathered would guide decision making about where the money should be spent and what types of resources — from more attorneys to case investigators — public defender offices should receive.\nThe state has appropriated $10 million for public defense services via a fund established in 2023. State funding would provide greater equity for public defenders throughout the state, which typically receive funding from their counties, Pollock said.\n“County by county, the budget depends on what that county can provide, and some counties don’t have as much revenue as others and so they just simply cannot afford to provide the resources that the public defenders need to do their jobs,” she said.\nLimited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.\nSome positions in public defender offices aren’t filled at all, including 83% of counties that don’t have any investigators in public defender offices, according to researchers.\nMost other states also have some level of state oversight and are the primary funding source for public defenders. Illinois doesn’t fall into either category.\nThe bill would require counties to bump up salaries for public defenders from 90% to 95% of a state’s attorney’s salary, something proponents say will help improve recruitment and retention.\nAppointing public defenders\nAnother key provision of the bill would change how public defenders are selected. Outside of Cook County, top county judges appoint or remove public defenders. Under the bill, a local nominating committee would be tasked with appointing or removing public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.\n“You’re now arguing in front of a judge who hires you and a judge who fires you, potentially. Whereas a state’s attorney is an elected official and a judge has no power over him or her and no power over their budget,” bill sponsor Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, said in an interview.\nChief judges could still be part of the local committees appointing public defenders, however. But their voice would be one of between four and six members of the commission that selects a county’s public defender. Other local commission members would include attorneys, representatives of law schools or legal professional organizations and former public defender clients.\nFor now, that process would not be required for counties with fewer than 35,000 people as those counties typically rely on contract attorneys for public defense that split their time in multiple counties. State law currently doesn’t require those smaller counties, which account for more than half of the state’s 102 counties, to have public defender offices. Cook County already has its own appointment process different from the rest of the state.\n“The problem is the appearance of impropriety,” Vella said. “We have a system right now in Illinois and in America where defendants and people who are in the system are starting to have some real questions about the fairness of the system.”\nPollock explained it makes sense that judges are part of the process because they see the attorneys perform in the courtroom and might be able to tell who would make a good public defender. But the problem is it could create an appearance for defendants that their public defender might change how they represent someone to make their “boss” — the chief judge — happy.\nFormer Madison County Public Defender John Rekowski disagreed.\n“The judges are in the best position to know the local landscape and know the local bench, know the local climate and pick the person who should furnish those services,” Rekowski said in an interview.\nRekowski and the Illinois State Bar Association are proposing that judges continue appointing the public defender, but the commission has the power to remove the public defender or reappoint the public defender to a new term. Rekowski said limiting the judge’s power over public defenders to just their first appointment removes “any possibility (of) some kind of retribution or intimidation.”\nThe bill is likely to go through more changes as it heads to the Senate for consideration.",

Myth Busting: Separating Fact from Fiction in Skin Care Myth: Endless Fruit for Eternal Youth While fruits are packed with beneficial nutrients, the key to effective skin care is balance. Overindulgence in fruit, especially those high in sugar, can lead to issues rather than improvements. Moderation ensures you reap the benefits without the drawbacks. It’s also crucial to remember that a holistic approach, including a varied diet, hydration, and sun protection, is vital for optimal skin health. No single food, not even fruit, is a magic solution. Myth: Exotic Equals Effective Exotic fruits often come with a halo of being superior for skin health, but local, seasonal fruits can be just as potent. They’re fresher, more sustainable, and often packed with the same, if not more, nutrients essential for skin vitality. Understanding the nutritional content and benefits of available fruits allows for informed decisions that can lead to effective and economical skin care solutions. Myth: Fruit-Based Skin Care is Always Safe Assuming all fruit-based skin care products or homemade remedies are safe is a misconception. Individual allergies, skin sensitivity, and the acidity of certain fruits can cause adverse reactions. Patch tests and professional advice are crucial steps before application. Moreover, the effectiveness of fruit-based treatments varies with skin type and condition. What works for one might not work for another, emphasizing the need for personalized skin care solutions. Myth: Immediate Results Guaranteed Expecting instant results from incorporating fruits into your diet or skin care routine is unrealistic. Skin regeneration and repair are processes that take time. Consistency and patience are vital in seeing tangible benefits. Moreover, skin health is influenced by a myriad of factors, including genetics, environment, and overall health. Thus, fruits contribute to a broader strategy for long-term skin health rather than providing a quick fix. Myth: The More, The Better The notion that consuming or applying more fruits will accelerate skin improvements is flawed. Like all aspects of health and nutrition, skin care requires a balanced approach. Excessive use of anything, fruits included, can lead to adverse effects. Respecting recommended daily intakes and understanding the properties of each fruit ensures you enjoy their benefits without overdoing it. A thoughtful, measured approach to fruit consumption and application is key to healthy, glowing skin. Conclusion The journey to radiant skin is a holistic one, where fruits play a vital role as natural nourishers and protectors. Their true power unfolds through a balanced, informed approach to skin care, debunking myths and embracing diversity. Remember, glowing skin isn’t about quick fixes or single solutions; it’s the result of consistent, thoughtful choices that celebrate moderation and the richness of nature’s bounty. As you embrace these natural treasures, you’re not just enjoying their flavors; you’re nurturing a future of healthier, more vibrant skin.",

    "title": "„Ich hasse es\": Junge Mutter rechnet mit Erziehung von Millennials ab",
    "text": "„Ich hasse es“: Junge Mutter rechnet mit Erziehung von Millennials ab\nEine Mutter verkündet in einem Instagram-Video, dass sie bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „hasst“. Ein Experte pflichtet ihr bei: „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden“.\nMit einem Video Anfang April 2025 macht die Mutter und Instagramerin Elena Bridgers, die sich mit der Evolution der Mutterschaft beschäftigt, einige ihrer Fans wütend. Darin kritisiert sie den aktuellen Goldstandard der Erziehung, an den sich viele Eltern halten: bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung (engl. gentle parenting).\n„Hier sind drei Gründe, warum ich bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung hasse“, sagt Bridgers, die vor einigen Monaten versuchte, ihr Kind mit einer Jahrhunderte-alten Methode zum Gemüse essen zu bringen. Grund eins: Keine Kultur auf der Welt erziehe Kinder so, außer der Westen. Zweitens gebe es keine wirkliche wissenschaftliche Evidenz, die beweise, dass bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung die beste Methode sei.\nDrittens sei bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „zu zeitintensiv“, sagt Bridgers. „Wer hat Zeit, auf die Knie zu gehen und jedes Gefühl des Kindes wertzuschätzen? Ich hab noch anderes zu tun“, sagt sie. In ihrer Erfahrung mache zu viel Beachtung das Verhalten trotziger Kinder noch schlimmer. „Kleinkind-Wutanfälle ignoriert man am besten.“\nWarum „extrem bedürfnisorientiertes Erziehen“ problematisch ist\nIn den Kommentaren unter Bridgers Instagram-Video sind einige ihrer Follower entsetzt. „Ich mag deinen Account, aber das enttäuscht mich jetzt“, schreibt eine Person. Ihrer Meinung nach sei die bei Millennials beliebte bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „unglaublich“. Für einige fühlt sich ihre Kontroverse nach Clickbait an. „Ich liebe deine Videos, aber bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung hat nur deswegen Nachteile, weil die Menschen denken, es bedeutet, keine Grenzen zu setzen.“\nDie Therapeutin Melanie Hubermann bestätigt bei BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA, dass die Erziehungsmethode von einigen Eltern falsch verstanden wird. „Dieses extrem bedürfnisorientierte Erziehen bedeutet, die Kinder einfach machen zu lassen, wonach ihnen gerade ist. Sie sollen sich individuell entfalten. Wenn sie der Meinung sind, sie müssen ihren Freund prügeln, dann sollen sie das tun, um herauszufinden, wie sich das anfühlt“, erklärt sie.\nDas funktioniere nicht. „Wir müssen Kindern Werte vermitteln und Grenzen setzen“, sagt Hubermann. „Wir überfordern Kinder, wenn wir ihnen nicht die Welt altersgerecht kleinhalten – mithilfe von Struktur und Regeln.“\nBedürfnisorientierte Erziehung: „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden“\nBedürfnisorientierte Erziehung ignoriere oft, dass auch Eltern Bedürfnisse hätten, ergänzt der Psychiater und Bindugsforscher Simon Meier aus Regensburg. „Bedürfnisse stehen immer in Konkurrenz zueinander. Kinder müssen lernen, dass sie nicht alleine auf diesem Planeten sind und ihre Bedürfnisse auch manchmal aufschieben müssen“, sagt er BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nEr nimmt Eltern die Angst davor, Bindungsstörungen auszulösen, wenn sie den Wutanfall eines Kindes oder das Schreien ihres Babys einmal ignorieren. „In der Bindungsforschung wissen wir: entscheidend ist, was in 75 Prozent der Fälle passiert. Bindungssysteme sind plastisch, die verzeihen einiges.“ Je nach Alter müsse man den Kindern zumuten, ihre Bedürfnisse selbst zu befriedigen.\nNatürlich bräuchten Neugeborene mehr Bedürfnisbefriedigung, aber auch da sei es möglich, ein Kind ein paar Minuten ohne traumatische Folgen schreien zu lassen. Eltern sollten auf ihre Intuition hören und ihr Kind dann unterstützen, wenn es traurig ist, es aber auch mal alleine lassen, wenn es nur wütend ist. „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden, ihn können schon kleine Kinder relativ gut regulieren“, sagt der Bindungsexperte und stützt damit Bridgers These, dass Wutanfälle bei Kindern auch mal ignoriert werden dürfen.",

    "text": "Chinese fighters flew dangerously close to Japanese patrol planes: Tokyo expressed concern\nKyiv • UNN\nChinese fighters flew extremely close to Japanese military aircraft. Tokyo expressed serious concern and called on Beijing to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.\nChinese fighter jets flew extremely close to Japanese military patrol planes last weekend. This was reported by official Tokyo, after two Chinese aircraft carriers were spotted simultaneously in the Pacific Ocean for the first time, UNN writes with reference to Reuters.\nDetails\n\"We have expressed serious concern to the Chinese side and solemnly asked to prevent a recurrence,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Thursday, referring to incidents on June 7-8 when, according to Tokyo, Chinese planes flew as close as 45 meters to Japanese planes.\nOn Saturday, a Chinese J-15 fighter jet from the Shandong aircraft carrier chased a Japanese P-3C patrol plane for about 40 minutes, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. On Sunday, the J-15 chased the P-3C for 80 minutes, staying ahead of the Japanese plane at a distance of only 900 meters, the statement said.\nA spokesman for the ministry's Joint Staff Office declined to disclose whether the same aircraft were involved in the incidents on both days.\nThe P-3C aircraft, which belongs to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and is based on Okinawa Island, was monitoring international waters in the Pacific Ocean.\nSuch abnormal approaches by Chinese military aircraft could potentially lead to accidental collisions\nJapanese government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular briefing that Tokyo would maintain contact with Beijing at various levels and ensure monitoring of the airspace around its territories.\nEarlier this week, Tokyo said that the Shandong and another Chinese aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, were conducting simultaneous operations in the Pacific Ocean for the first time, calling it a step that shows Beijing's intention to further expand its capabilities beyond its borders.\nBeijing said the operations were \"routine training\" maneuvers that were not aimed at specific countries.\nAdditions\nUNN previously reported that in China spotted a new ship with an unusual design resembling an aircraft carrier.\nChinese warships entered the Arctic Ocean for the first time to patrol jointly with the Russian military.",

    "text": "The Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS), which operates ALLTV, launched its Panalo sa ALLTV promo on July 1 to give viewers a chance to win a brand-new house and lot every week.\nAMBS management announced the promo through its official website, https://www.facebook.com/alltvph/, and social media pages.\nEight lucky winners will be drawn during the promo period to win a house and lot package from Vista Land. Additionally, twenty viewers can win P500 each day.\nThe promo runs from July 1 until August 26. ALLTV will flash QR codes and “words of the day” throughout its programming, from 12:00 noon to 11:15 p.m.\nOnce they scan the QR code, participants will be directed to the ALLTV promo site to fill out a form. The form requires their full name (as it appears on a government-issued ID), full address, email address, birth date, and mobile number.\nAs part of the entry process, viewers are also required to upload a selfie. To read the full mechanics, visit https://www.facebook.com/alltvph/.\nALLTV airs popular programs like the country’s longest-running TV newscast TV Patrol and variety show It’s Showtime.\nViewers can also enjoy classic television programs produced by ABS-CBN through Jeepney TV, which is part of ALLTV’s daily offerings.\nALLTV can be watched on various channels depending on your cable provider: Channel 2 (Free TV at Planet Cable); Channel 35 (Cignal and Skycable- provincial areas); Channel 13 (Skycable in Metro Manila) and Channel 2 (for Sinag, Cablelink, GSAT, and other cable TV).",
