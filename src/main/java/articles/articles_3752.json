    "title": "Norway issues international warrant for man linked to Lebanon pager blasts",
    "text": "Norway police have issued an international search request for a missing man linked to the booby-trapped pagers in Lebanon. Rinson Jose, 39, a Norwegian-Indian salesman owning a tech consultant company in Bulgaria with links to the Israeli regime and involved in the sales of the Taiwanese communication devices to Hezbollah, has gone missing after being connected to the deal for the exploding devices. Jose, who lives in Norway, worked for the DN Media Group's sales department. Local media contacted his family and friends in India and reported that Jose had registered a company in Bulgaria. The Pondicherry University MBA graduate, born and raised in Kerala, arrived in Norway ten years ago to study for a Masters degree at Oslo Metropolitan University. Jose's Norwegian employer said he had left for a business conference in Boston, USA on September 17, and the company has not been able to contact Jose since September 18. Jose's wife has also been unreachable since then. “Yesterday, Sept. 25, the Oslo police district received a missing person report in connection with the pager case,” Oslo police said in a Thursday email to Reuters. “A missing person’s case has been opened, and we have sent out an international warrant for the person,” it added. Last week, thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah and people affiliated with them exploded, killing dozens and wounding thousands more in Lebanon and Syria. The internationally condemned terrorist attack was instantly attributed to the arch-enemy of Hezbollah, the Israeli regime and its espionage agency, Mossad.",

    "text": "Former apprentice becomes production manager at the company where he started at 16 A loyal employee has been promoted to production manager at Stairways Midlands, almost three decades on from starting out there as a teenager. [John Corser](/news/authors/john-corser/) Andy Clarke, 44, joined Stairways Midlands, one of the UK’s largest manufacturers of volume staircases and door solutions, as a carpentry and joinery apprentice at just 16. He worked his way up over the past 28 years and has now been made Production Manager at the Walsall factory, where he has spent the majority of his career, after Stairways acquired the factory 20 years ago. The story of his steady climb with one company is, as Andy describes, “something you don’t think happens anymore”, but he counts himself fortunate to have remained loyal to one company throughout his career. Andy said: “I’ve worked all my life to get into this role. I started from the bottom and progressed through, staying loyal to the same company my whole career – something you think of only happening for people years ago. “It’s a great company to work for, and it has been very good to me. All those years of hard work and loyalty were recognised - it has all paid off. “I’m not academically bright but I have common sense and I’m good with my hands so it was a good fit from the start and I really enjoyed the work. When I look back to the early days, I remember thinking ‘I would love to do that job’ and now here I am. “It’s been a good journey and I just want it to carry on now and do the best I can do in this position; to do good things for Stairways to help it continue to be a success.” Andy’s career has taken him from the factory floor, where he spent much of his career making and then fitting staircases for major home builders. Six years ago, he was made quality control and improvement manager, implementing a number of improvements including launching the “eze-ways”, Stairways’ demountable balustrading fixing solution which makes it easy to fit handrails that comply with current British Standards in minutes. He was also behind the Railsafe handrail system, which works in tandem with “eze-ways” to make it simple to install safety railings on site. He also worked to improve processes, including contributing to the re-writing of risk assessments and all the method statements for the machinery. His huge contribution and strong working relationships were well recognised, leading to his promotion. Karen Wood, joint managing director, commercial, at Stairways, said: “I am delighted to see Andy Clarke appointed as the permanent production manager at our Walsall location. After working with him for almost 30 years, there was no doubt in my mind that he was the right person for the job. “Andy has worked incredibly hard, remaining loyal and supportive throughout his time at Stairways. His work ethic, ability to mentor, coach and work with real people in everyday life, as well as knowing and being able to clearly communicate all things Staircases is remarkable, and one of his biggest assets. “He is well-respected, has a great sense of humour, a huge heart and is all around a really nice guy. He’s one of a kind.” Andy, who is married with two teenage sons, added: “I want to look after the staff and make things easier in the factory. People need to come to work happy to be honest, so morale is a big thing. I need to build up the team under me, work with the team leaders, and get people into the right places where I know they can do their best.” Stairways, founded in 1989, has grown to become one of the UK’s largest manufacturers of carpentry and joinery products, with three production facilities, including the Walsall factory. With more than 30 years of expertise in the industry, they now deliver quality staircases, doors, and door sets to a wide variety of national and regional house builders, sub-contractors, contractors, architects, designers, specifiers and installers.",

    "text": "Il campione del mondo ha chiuso in testa la prima giornata di gara davanti a Evans e Ogier\nDopo la classica partenza dalla Place du Casino di Montecarlo, le sorprese non sono mancate sui 54,16 km cronometrati umidi e con qualche placca di verglas e in alcuni tratti parecchio fango, della prima tappa della gara monegasca. Ogier ha subito allungato vincendo le prime due speciali in notturna di Digne les Bains-Chaudon-Norante (19,01 km) e Faucon du Caire-Bréziers (21,18 km), ma poi sul crono di Avançon-Notre Dame du Laus (13,97 km) vinto da Evans, il pilota francese della Toyota si è girato perdendo 23”5 lasciando la leadership a Neuville (Hyundai). Il pilota belga campione del mondo ha così chiuso in testa la prima giornata di gara con un vantaggio di 2” su Evans e 12”8 su Ogier, con Tanak quarto a 27” e Fourmaux quinto a 30”. Nel Wrc 2 guida Yohan Rossel (Citroen) con il nostro Roberto Daprà (Skoda) quarto.\nDomani la seconda tappa si annuncia con un po’ di verglas al mattino e prevede 107,34 km cronometrati e sei speciali, cioè quelle di Saint Maurice-Aubessagne (18,68 km), Saint Léger les Mélèzes-La Bâtie Neuve (16,68 km) e La Bréole-Selonnet (18,31 km) ripetute due volte. Poi sabato la terza tappa, la più lunga con i suoi 131,40 km cronometrati, con sei prove speciali, infine domenica la tappa finale Gap-Monaco di 50,90 km cronometrati con tre crono in programma e per terminare la power stage del Turini, La Bollène Vésubie-Peïra Cava (17,92 km) con premiazione finale alla Place du Casino alle ore 16.15.\nLink copiato",

    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the\nIsraeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n\"The task here is to dismantle Hamas - so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. \"We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.\"\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT'S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\nIsrael and Hamas at war\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/\nYEARENDER-Gaza in 2024: Signs of more devastation, open-ended occupation\nIsraeli troops killed hostages, mistaking their cries for help as ambush -military\nFreed hostage recalls fight to save children, fears for women still held in Gaza\nFACTBOX-What is Egypt's proposal for Gaza?\nFACTBOX-What is the Palestinian group Hamas?\nFACTBOX-Shipping firms react to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)\n(( ))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "text": "High Share Of Quarterly Renewable Electricity Generation As Industrial Demand For Electricity Fell\nThe latest Energy Quarterly data release from the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) shows electricity generation in the October to December 2024 quarter was the lowest December quarter on record since 2016, says MBIE Domains Manager Amapola Generosa.\n“A combination of hydro lakes refilling beyond historical means, increased year-on-year geothermal, wind, and solar generation, along with reduced electricity demand resulted in 94.3 per cent of all electricity being generated from renewable sources in the December 2024 quarter. This also meant that we relied less on coal and gas fired generation,” says Generosa.\n“The renewable share of generation reached its 4th highest quarter level on record, with quarterly emissions from electricity generation falling to their lowest level on record.\n“Often, a greater share of non-renewable energy is needed to meet overall electricity demand – however with generation at its lowest quarter level since 2016, renewables were able to meet the majority of demand.\n“Lower electricity use by New Zealand Aluminium Smelters, following its demand response agreement with Meridian being called on in the September 2024 quarter, contributed to a 9 per cent year-on-year fall in electricity demand from the industrial sector.\n“Gas generation fell 29.9 per cent year-on-year, while coal fired generation fell 64.1 per cent year-on-year this quarter. As a result, emissions from electricity generation fell accordingly. Emissions were 400 kt CO2-e in the December 2024 quarter, the lowest level on record.\n“In addition to hydro lakes filling beyond historical means, total renewable generation capacity was bolstered this quarter with a 5% increase in new geothermal capacity due to a new plant at Te Huka 3 connecting to the grid,” says Generosa.\nAlongside Energy Quarterly, MBIE has also released 2024 year end data for Oil, Gas, Coal, and Prices (petrol, diesel and natural gas). This data, along with full energy quarterly results, data, and graphs can be read on the MBIE website here: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/energy-statistics-and-modelling/energy-publications-and-technical-papers/new-zealand-energy-quarterly\n2025 Quarter 1 results will be announced on 12 June 2025.\nNotes:\nPower generation by source from October - December 2024 (Q4):",

    "text": "Washington DC, March 10: As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials. The report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said. Amid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN.\nPM Narendra Modi Stopped War Between Russia and Ukraine, Claims BJP’s New Lok Sabha Election 2024 Ad Campaign (Watch Video).\n\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said. US officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying. \"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can't demonstrate this positively, but I think that's our assessment.\"\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict: PM Narendra Modi Conveyed to Russian President Vladimir Putin That Today’s Era Is Not of War, Says Japanese PM Fumio Kishida.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said.\nNotably, late summer 2022 was also proving a 'devastating period' for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia's biggest prize since the invasion. As these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN.\nAlso, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack. In October 2022, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\"\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported. \"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\"",
