Почему сюда не дошли люди с бензопилами, непонятно. Сколько ещё таких безнадзорных мест по Зеленограду, тоже неизвестно.\nПредставитель префектуры в\nзеленоградском телеграм-чате сказал, что остатки распиленных стволов (порубочные остатки) вывезут до 23 мая. Хотя до этой даты больше двух недель, но этот срок кажется чересчур оптимистичным, если до сих пор даже не все стволы убрали с пешеходных дорожек.\nСтаньте нашим подписчиком, чтобы мы могли делать больше интересных материалов по этой теме\nAdFox START yandex_zelenogradrsya Площадка: zelenograd.ru (desktop) / * / * Тип баннера: 970x250 Расположение: 970x250Реклама",

    "text": "READ MORE: James Packer's ex-wife Erica packs on the PDA with new boyfriend celebrity chef Shannon Bennett\nErica Packer, James Packer’s glamorous ex-wife, has been living it up in Byron Bay with her new love interest, celebrity chef Shannon Bennett.\nThe couple have been spotted out and about this Christmas holidays, and recently enjoyed a lavish lunch at the famous The Farm restaurant in the beachside town.\nErica, 46, looked casual yet chic in a black top and long black skirt, her dark hair worn down.\nShannon, 48, who is the ex-partner of actress Madeleine West, wore a black Jolly Rogers Inn shirt and red hat as the couple congregated for lunch with their respective children in tow.\nAs the two families laughed with each other at the table, the pair chatted over their meal, and at one point shared a cute moment where Erica fed a Shannon a piece of her lunch.\nErica Packer, James Packer’s ex-wife, enjoyed a festive luncheon at The Farm restaurant in Byron Bay last week with her new beau, celebrity chef Shannon Bennett and their respective children (all pictured)\nEarlier in the day, Shannon and Erica were spotted enjoying a romantic beach date with Erica and their children.\nThe photos showed the pair packing on the PDA as they stroll down the beach, kissing and hugging as they soaked up the summer sunshine.\nThe couple are reportedly staying at Shannon’s $2million beachfront property on the Belongil Beach peninsula, with his six children Phoenix, Hendrix, Xascha, Xanthe, Xahlia and Margaux.\nThe pair, who have nine children combined, had a raucous time at the upmarket restaurant\nErica, 46, looked casual yet chic in a black top and long black skirt, her dark her worn down\nErica’s children Indigo, Jackson and Emmanuelle – who she shares with ex James – are also apparently staying in the sprawling mansion.\n‘They weren’t flaunting it, but they certainly weren’t hiding it either,’ an onlooker told The Sunday Telegraph of the pair’s romance.\n‘They waited until the kids went in the house until they shared a cuddle and a kiss,’ they added.\nShannon, 48, who is the ex partner of actress Madeleine West, wore a black Jolly Rogers Inn shirt and red hat as the couple congregated for lunch with their respective children in tow\nThe two families chatted with each other at the table\nAt one point, Erica and Shannon huddled and shared an intimate conversation\nThe source claimed Erica and Shannon’s children seemed to be getting on well, and spent the day riding electric bikes by the beach.\nJames and Erica married in 2007 and later split in 2013, but are on good terms as they co-parent their three children.\nErica reportedly received a $100 million divorce payment, and purchased a family home in Los Angeles shortly after the break-up.\nThe kids laughed and played at the famous Byron Bay restaurant as their meal arrived\nAt one point, Erica got an impromptu hairdo from one of the girls\nLater, the children enjoyed ice cream in the warm Byron air\nJames also bought an $80million Los Angeles mansion so he could be closer to Erica and their children whenever he was in town.\n‘James’ main priority at the moment is the wellbeing of his kids,” a family friend told The Daily Telegraph at the time of the divorce.\nWhen Erica visits Sydney, she often lives with her former husband and their children at James’ $72 million Crown penthouse home.\nAt one point the new couple shared a cute moment where Erica fed a Shannon a piece of her lunch\nEarlier in the day, Shannon and Erica were spotted enjoying a romantic beach date with Erica and their children\nThe ex-couple are so close that they often enjoy family holidays together.\nIn contrast, Shannon’s relationship with ex partner Madeleine is not as amicable.\nShannon, who rose to fame on MasterChef Australia, split from Madeleine in September 2018 after 13 years of dating.\nMadeleine later stated the separation process ‘turned love toxic’.\nThe couple are reportedly staying at Shannon’s $2million beachfront property on the Belongil Beach peninsula, with his six children Phoenix, Hendrix, Xascha, Xanthe, Xahlia and Margaux\nTwo years after their breakup, she left Melbourne and moved to the Byron Bay area to be near their six children, buying her own $4.6million property overlooking Tallow Beach.\nIn May 2022, Shannon said Madeleine saw their children fortnightly, while they spend the remainder of the time with him.\n‘The kids live with me full time and they visit their mother every fortnight for a few days,’ he told the Herald Sun at the time.\nErica’s children Indigo, Jackson and Emmanuelle – who she shares with ex James – are also apparently staying in the sprawling mansion. ‘They weren’t flaunting it, but they certainly weren’t hiding it either,’ an onlooker told The Sunday Telegraph of the pair’s romance\n‘They waited until the kids went in the house until they shared a cuddle and a kiss,’ they added\nThe source claimed Erica and Shannon’s children seemed to be getting on well, and spent the day riding electric bikes by the beach\nMadeleine spent this year embroiled in court battles with Benny Bennett, Shannon’s elderly father, who took out an AVO against her after an alleged clash at the chef’s Byron mansion in 2022.\nA magistrate enforced the AVO describing Madeleine as an ‘evasive’ and unreliable witness, and her alleged treatment of her ex father-in-law, 75, as ‘verging on being aggressive’.\nBut the decision was thrown out when Madeleine appealed to the NSW District Court and won in a ruling by Judge Jonathan Priestley who said ‘the evidence of facts supporting them is light on, and not supported by’ the footage from five different CCTV cameras around Shannon Bennett’s home.\nErica married James Packer in 2007, and they later split in 2013.

    "title": "Jayden Danns had chance to be coached by family – and why dad rejected the offer",
    "text": "Jayden Danns is one of several players at the Liverpool academy with a footballing father. His dad, Neil Danns, spoke to This Is Anfield and explained why he decided not to coach his son.\nWith Danns in the spotlight after winning the\nLeague Cup and scoring twice vs. Southampton in the FA Cup, we looked back at an exclusive interview with his father, Neil, who is now Tranmere’s assistant manager.\nIn 2022, Danns Sr. explained to This Is Anfield how he planned to allow his son to develop, and how this included choosing not to directly coach his son at the academy.\nNow, assistant to Nigel Adkins at Tranmere, a couple of years ago Danns was working as a coach at the academy, a time when his son, Jayden, was just breaking into the under-18s.\nNeil told\nThis Is Anfield: “I haven’t been coaching him directly at the academy. I had the opportunity to work with his group, but I decided not to.”\nHe explained the reason being: “Just because I’d like for him to go on the journey by himself, without having the pressures of me getting on his back!”\nThe former\nPremier League player also told of how Jayden still had “a lot to learn and a long way to go,” but “with the standard of coaching that goes on at the academy” he was in “no better hands to take his game to the next level.”\nHis comments from 2022 definitely suggest he saw something in his son to suggest he had a bright future in football.\nDanns Sr. said: “We know to get in that Liverpool first team you have to be a special player, and Jayden has just got to focus on himself, keep his head down, keep working hard every single day and see where it takes him.\n“I’m proud of him no matter what because I see the work that he does put in. He’s got a great attitude, so long may that continue.”\nDanns’ under-18 coach, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson, said similar about the young forward, telling\nhttps://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/02/how-free-scoring-jayden-danns-earned-his-liverpool-debut-his-attitude-is-top/ recently: “I think Jayden’s personality is infectious, his character and his attitude towards football is top.\n“He’s trying to get better every day, every moment of every day, and it’s no surprise to anybody that works with him the improvements that he’s starting to make. I’m sure that he’ll continue to do that.”\nYoung Danns hasn’t been giving the narrative answer when he’s said it’s been his dream to play for Liverpool. His father, Neil, explained: “His dream is to one day wear the red shirt and come on at Anfield. If that’s his dream, then that’s my dream [for him!].”\nIt is fantastic to see that dream coming true, and even better to watch him contribute in a significant way to major honours.\nDanns’ hard work doesn’t stop now, though, as his father told the\nAthletic after Sunday’s League Cup final.\nJayden Danns as a ball boy at Anfield in 2022\n“It’s crazy. I’m proud of him but the journey has just started and he knows he’s got a lot of hard work in front of him,” Neil said.\n“Scoring the winner would have been a dream — but it was a dream anyway. It’s just good he’s getting himself into positions at that level where he’s making himself a threat, which is good for his learning and development.”\nHe has scored two goals for the Reds since then, another feat his father is no doubt very proud of.",

    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) – Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group on Saturday welcomed a call by the United Nations Security Council for a cessation of hostilities in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, offering a potential respite from the 11-month-old conflict.\nRamadan is expected to start on Sunday evening.\nIn a statement, the RSF expressed hope that the Security Council resolution would “significantly lessen the suffering of the Sudanese people by ensuring the smooth delivery of humanitarian aid” and pave the way for a political process leading to a permanent ceasefire.\nWar erupted in Sudan on April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese army and the RSF. The U.N. says nearly 25 million people – half Sudan’s population – need aid, some 8 million have fled their homes and hunger is rising. Washington says the warring parties have committed war crimes.\nOn Friday, the Security Council adopted a British-drafted resolution for a cessation of hostilities in Ramadan with 14 votes in favour, while Russia abstained. However, the mechanism for implementing the resolution remains unclear.\nSudan’s U.N. ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed, told the council on Thursday that the president of the country’s transitional council commended the appeal of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a Ramadan truce. However, he said the leader is “wondering about how to do this.”\n“In embracing the proposed humanitarian ceasefire, we express our readiness to partake in discussions concerning the establishment of mutually agreed upon monitoring mechanisms,” the RSF said in its Saturday statement.\n“These mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the effective implementation of the ceasefire and for achieving the humanitarian objectives intended by this resolution.”\n(Reporting by Hatem Maher and Ahmed Tolba; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Giles Elgood)",
