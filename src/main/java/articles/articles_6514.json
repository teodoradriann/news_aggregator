    "title": "Vance accused Walz of 'stolen valor.' What to know about Walz’s military record",
    "text": "For more on the 2024 race, head to the NPR Network's elections updates page. Late Tuesday afternoon, the Harris campaign released a video of Tim Walz talking about gun control. Walz, whom Kamala Harris recently announced as her running mate, talks about banning assault rifles as part of what he calls “common sense” proposals. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in the video. That was all Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance needed. “Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this?” Vance said. The vice presidential candidate is supposed to be an attack dog, sometimes landing the lower blows that might seem unpresidential. But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their service shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn’t seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz’s phrasing opened up a line of attack — and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles. War, combat and service – and a charge of “stolen valor” Walz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan. So Vance, and many veterans on social media, took issue with Walz saying he’d carried weapons “in war.” The Harris campaign said in a statement: “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\" But Vance went a lot further, with an attack that the Trump campaign probably had prepared. “What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said. Since Walz first ran for Congress and then governor, he’s faced attacks around the timing of his retirement. Vance’s accusation echoes one made by two fellow high-ranking sergeants from the Minnesota Guard who publicly attacked Walz in 2018, in a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune. They slammed Walz for “conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.” According to the Minnesota National Guard, Walz retired in May 2005, two months before his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in July 2005. It’s likely that Walz put in for retirement months before that May. It’s also clear that guardsmen anticipated deployment to Iraq months before July. According to several of his contemporaries in the guard Walz talked about it as a hard decision: that if he deployed he’d miss his best chance to run for Congress. “He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,” Allan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. “He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn’t take that decision lightly at all.” The unit didn’t go to Iraq until March 2006, 10 months after Walz retired, where it stayed for a grueling 22-month extended deployment. The charge has dogged Walz, and in his last run for governor in 2022, it was even leveled by a political opponent who never served at all. Walz’s rank The latest round of attacks on Walz stirred up another confusing point about his rank. Walz served as a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. But his retirement papers put him one step lower – a master sergeant. The Minnesota National Guard told NPR that Walz retired before completing academic requirements to keep the higher rank. “He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,” said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, the Minnesota National Guard’s state public affairs officer. So while Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major, which also made him the highest enlisted member serving in Congress, and he can even get away with saying he retired as a command sergeant major, he cannot say he is a “retired command sergeant major.” On Thursday the Harris campaign changed Walz’s official bio on their website to reflect that. Charges of “swiftboating” Attacking an opponent’s military service has a short history in presidential campaigns – the verb “swiftboat” dates back only 20 years, when George W. Bush’s campaign attacked combat-decorated John Kerry’s military service in Vietnam, which might have seemed risky since Bush avoided serving there. Donald Trump, who also avoided going to Vietnam, took the tactic to another level, attacking his GOP critic John McCain’s storied status as a POW. Now, Harris supporters are claiming that Vance is trying to “swiftboat” Walz, and even pointing to a member of the Bush-era campaign who is now working for Trump . Veterans groups are generally keeping out of the fray; many veterans service organizations are on record praising the choice of two enlisted military veterans as vice-presidential nominees. “This means that regardless of the outcome in November, the next vice president of the United States will be a former enlisted service member. I am pleased to see both major parties recognize that military service is once again a valued experience in choosing the candidate for the second highest position in the country,” Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Al Lipphardt said in a statement.

    "title": "Why a NYPD big overtime bill barely reduced New York subway crime",
    "text": "If you’d like to visit a New York City public library on a Sunday, you’re out of luck, thanks to [recent city budget cuts](https://www.nypl.org/about/service-impacts). But if you’d like to see a subway station crawling with cops (including the [PR-friendly robot](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/eric-adams-debuts-420-pound-robot-assigned-to-patrol-nyc-subway-station/4704333/) variety), the possibilities are bountiful. This is life in [Eric Adams’ New York.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-trump-rcna87091) The outrageous increase in funding resulted in a minuscule improvement in crime rates. In 2022, amid concerns about rising crime in the city’s transit system, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams took the [ idea of “defund the police”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/defund-police-dominated-2020-what-happened-n1278506) and flipped it on its head. They dreamed up a strategy of “the three Cs” — “Cops, Cameras, Care” — which Hochul announced in October last year. What if, they imagined, we added more than a thousand uniformed police officers to patrol the subway every day and paid them much more — millions more? Now, one year later, [city records show](https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-overtime-pay-in-the-subway-went-from-4-million-to-155-million-this-year) it led to a $151 million increase in NYPD overtime pay, a negligible decrease in crime and a vast increase in fare evasion tickets and arrests of people of color. From 2021 to 2022, the city’s subways saw an almost 40% increase in reported felonies. The dramatic rise was due to vastly decreased ridership during the peak of the pandemic, and yet it was still [overall lower than pre-pandemic crime rates](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/us/new-york-subway-crime-adams-miller/index.html). But that didn’t stop hysteria from seizing city residents and tabloid covers, after a number of high-profile incidents, including the [death of Jordan Neely](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/death-of-jordan-neely-ruled-a-homicide-172858437726) and several incidents of women being [pushed onto](https://abc7ny.com/subway-crime-woman-pushed-queens/13658414/) the [subway tracks](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/woman-pushed-onto-tracks-at-midtown-subway-station-police-searching-for-suspect/4780308/) in separate attacks. And thus Hochul and Adams’ [more cops, less crime](https://gothamist.com/news/hochul-adams-announce-more-cops-will-patrol-new-york-city-subway-system) plan was hatched. But the outrageous increase in funding resulted in a minuscule improvement in crime rates and, in some categories, increases. The stats, [obtained by Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-overtime-pay-in-the-subway-went-from-4-million-to-155-million-this-year), found that there were 48 fewer serious crimes (such as murder, rape and robbery) overall in the city’s subways this year. Despite that drop, assaults increased by 5%, with 26 more than last year. (The mayor and the governor didn’t respond to Gothamist's requests for comment.) To say we’re not getting our $155 million worth appears to be an understatement. Most disturbing of all, however, is the focus on fare evasion. According to the city’s stats, 82% of those ticketed for fare evasion and 92% of those arrested were people of color. On top of being racist, these interventions do nothing to actually reduce fare evasion. A report issued in June found that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority [lost $690 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/nyregion/mta-fare-evasion.html) in 2022 trying to fight fare evasion, despite an already beefed-up crackdown. [A 2018 analysis](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/auditor/auditor-reports/all-landing-pgs/2018/rapidride-2018.aspx) of fare evasion enforcement in Seattle, meanwhile, found that it actually cost more to enforce and prosecute than it cost simply to lose the revenue from the lost fares. (NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper told Gothamist that \"targeting fare jumpers saves the MTA money and brings 'order' to the underground.\") In practice, it’s not the job of police to prevent and fight crime. “You have people who genuinely cannot afford the cost of transit because they cannot afford the cost of living in New York City,” Molly Griffard, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, told [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/nyregion/mta-fare-evasion.html) in June. “There’s this sort of kneejerk reaction to just rely on policing our way out of a problem that police can’t solve.” If we zoom out, we can see that the Cops, Cameras, Care program hasn’t actually achieved its stated purpose. It has actually made subway riding more perilous for Black and brown New Yorkers. It also reminds us that, in practice, it’s not the job of police to prevent and fight crime. Reuters, [reporting on a 2022 analysis](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/police-are-not-primarily-crime-fighters-according-data-2022-11-02/) of county budgets and policing data by Catalyst California and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, noted that its conclusions contribute “to a growing line of research showing that police departments don’t solve serious or violent crimes with any regularity, and in fact, spend very little time on crime control, in contrast to popular narratives.” And yet those narratives go a long way toward frothing up public fears over crime, making people believe that a $151 million increase in overtime for cops is ultimately worth it to create the illusion of safety. “The media dramatically [ over](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/13/news-media-offers-consistently-warped-portrayals-of-black-families-study-finds/)- [cover](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/dangerous-racialization-crime-u-s-news-media/) low-level crime by the poor,” civil rights lawyer Alec Karakatsanis [told](https://prismreports.org/2022/02/23/police-dont-stop-crime-but-you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-news/) [Prism](https://prismreports.org/2022/02/23/police-dont-stop-crime-but-you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-news/) last year. “And so you see local news media every single day all across the country, in the national media as well, constantly talking about shoplifting, robbery, carjacking, shootings, things like that. When you compare them to the leading causes of suffering and death in the U.S., [low-level offenders are] minuscule contributors.” Adams’ desire to bloat police earning potential comes at the cost of city budget cuts that have led to, among other things, public library branch closures on Sundays. Last week, the City Council voted overwhelmingly to pass a police transparency bill, which aims to “check racially biased policing by requiring police to report demographic information about people they stop, including their perceived race and ethnicity.” But before its passage, Adams [reportedly offered](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-councilmember-says-adams-tried-to-stop-policing-bill-by-horse-trading-budget-cuts-it-failed) at least one council member restoration of budget cuts in areas important to that member in exchange for a no vote on the bill. (A spokesman for the mayor told Gothamist that \"the mayor did not offer to a councilmember to restore any budget cuts in exchange for a vote on Intro 586-A.\") It’s a dark reflection on this city when the mayor would use public resources as bargaining chips to help cops avoid accountability. Families having a free educational space to spend a Sunday is a building block of a healthy society; vastly overpaying law enforcement to be bad at its job is not.",

Parents have expressed their dissatisfaction with the college management, but their appeals for support have gone unheard by the relevant authorities.\nField Marshal KM Cariappa College (FMKMCC) in Madikeri, a government senior college formerly affiliated with Mangaluru University, now has only its Final Year Degree classes functioning under Mangaluru University following the establishment of Kodagu University.\nThe non-appointment of permanent teaching staff and the non-payment of salaries to guest lecturers are significantly impacting the education of Final Year degree students at the institution.\n“Many subjects in the final year are not being taught due to the non-appointment of lecturers. The education of the students was affected earlier during the protest and boycott of classes by guest lecturers due to non-payment of salaries. And now, there are no lecturers to teach several subjects. What are final year students to do?” questioned Jayanthi Rai, the Vice-President of the Parents & Teachers Association at FMKMCC.\nShe explained that there is a shortage of lecturers for several important subjects in the final year. “The college has students from financially weak backgrounds. Despite their struggles, the students have paid fees to attend classes. However, the head of Mangaluru University has failed to appoint lecturers, and the management is meddling with the future of the students,” she added.\nSources, who requested anonymity, confirmed that several subjects are not being taught to the final year students due to the absence of lecturers. The final year, which is attached to Mangaluru University, has 13 vacant lecturer posts.\nAdditionally, 12 guest lecturers have not been paid their salaries for months, and students are struggling without teaching staff for several important subjects, including Computer Science and Journalism.\nMeanwhile, the university's financial constraints are also impacting the management of the institution, with officials struggling even to purchase necessary stationery and other daily requirements. An interview has been scheduled for September 19 to fill the vacant posts.",

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nSiria ha denunciado este jueves un ataque israelí desde los Altos del Golán, ocupados por Israel, hacia el sur del país en medio de la escalada de la violencia por la situación en la Franja de Gaza, controlada por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás).\n\"Nuestras fuerzas de defensa aérea respondieron a los misiles y derribaron la mayoría de ellos\", ha señalado una fuente militar siria a la agencia de noticias estatal SANA, agregando que ha habido \"pérdidas materiales\", si bien se desconoce si hay víctimas.\nSegún ha informado el Observatorio Sirio para los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Londres e informante en el país árabe, las fuerzas israelíes han disparado misiles contra el Aeropuerto Internacional de Damasco y un puesto de control en el sur, ubicado en la ciudad de Sweida.\nEsto se produce después de que en la víspera despegara el primer avión desde que el aeropuerto quedó fuera de servicio tras un ataque israelí el pasado 22 de octubre que acabó con la vida de dos trabajadores civiles del aeropuerto y dañó las pistas. Los vuelos estaban desviados al aeropuerto de Latakia.\nLos Altos del Golán son un territorio que Israel arrebató a Siria durante la Guerra de los Seis Días (1967) y la Guerra del Yom Kipur (1973) y que se anexionó de forma efectiva en 1981, en un movimiento no reconocido por la comunidad internacional.\nMás información Hamás Israel Siria Palestina",

    "text": "Vajillas y cristalerías: la luz del verano resplandece sobre la mesa de Zara Home\nEl verano se sirve en mesas bajo el sol. Fotografiamos las vajillas, cristalerías y cuberterías de Zara Home para capturar su luz, su calma y su belleza. Objetos de deseo que cuentan historias sin pronunciar una sola palabra\nLas vajillas no necesitan hablar para contar su historia en silencio. El plato astillado de una abuela, el vaso ámbar preferido de la hermana, el mantel bordado que solo se usa en Navidad o todos esos cubiertos heredados que conservan con digna decadencia el brillo de otra época. No es el lujo lo que les da valor, sino su carga emocional, su capacidad para alojar recuerdos. En la cocina, cada utensilio puede volverse un símbolo: de afecto, de rutina, de ausencia. Ponen belleza donde no la hay, orden en lo cotidiano, y convierten la mesa en un escenario de emociones.\nComo en las novelas, donde la vajilla habla por los personajes, todos estos utensilios sustituyen el lenguaje cuando este se agota. Son testigos de lo que se quiebra y de lo que persiste. Más que funcionales, son aliados íntimos, profundamente arraigados en el corazón. Y en su discreción, guardan lo esencial: el alma de quienes los han usado, el eco de lo vivido, la memoria convertida en forma, peso y textura.\n“La mesa estaba puesta con los manteles bordados por Mamá Elena, la vajilla de porcelana y las copas de cristal traídas de Francia. Tita colocaba los cubiertos con manos temblorosas, sabiendo que cada uno de ellos sería testigo de un banquete lleno de silencios y verdades no dichas” — Laura Esquivel, 'Como agua para chocolate'\n“Una vajilla antigua puede ser la única herencia de una familia venida a menos y, sin embargo, más preciada que las acciones o los terrenos: guarda los gestos de una madre, el sonido de una cena en la infancia, el roce de las cucharas con los labios queridos” — Julio Ramón Ribeyro, 'Prosas apátridas'\n“Mis manteles eran de hilo blanco, y aunque las copas no hacían juego, cada una tenía su historia. La mesa, al caer la tarde, se llenaba de luz y de pequeñas sombras; era como si África se sentara a cenar con nosotros” — Isak Dinesen, 'Memorias de África'\n“Conozco más personas destruidas por una mala mesa —cubiertos de lata, platos desportillados, servilletas de papel— que por el alcohol o la pobreza. Hay una dignidad silenciosa en una mesa bien puesta” — M. F. Kennedy Fisher, 'The Gastronomical Me'\n“Durante las cenas, Fermina Daza mantenía la ceremonia intacta: el mantel de lino, los cubiertos de plata bruñida, la sopera humeante. Aun cuando la tristeza les invadía, todo parecía dispuesto para la llegada de un huésped ilustre que nunca llegaba” — Gabriel García Márquez, 'El amor en los tiempos del cólera'\n“El mantel estaba limpio, la vajilla brillaba y la cuchara que removía el té tenía el mismo sonido delicado que una joya al ser rozada con otra. Todo parecía estar dispuesto con el cuidado de quien espera que algo sagrado ocurra: el momento de mojar la magdalena” — Marcel Proust, 'En busca del tiempo perdido'.\nLas vajillas no necesitan hablar para contar su historia en silencio. El plato astillado de una abuela, el vaso ámbar preferido de la hermana, el mantel bordado que solo se usa en Navidad o todos esos cubiertos heredados que conservan con digna decadencia el brillo de otra época. No es el lujo lo que les da valor, sino su carga emocional, su capacidad para alojar recuerdos. En la cocina, cada utensilio puede volverse un símbolo: de afecto, de rutina, de ausencia.

    "title": "Andoni López, futbolista de la Ponferradina: «En Lugo me apoyaban en el campo y en la calle me daban muchos ánimos»",
    "text": "[CDLUGO](/cdlugo) El ex del Lugo compite ahora en el rival de los lucenses este domingo en El Toralín14 mar 2024 . Actualizado a las 22:48 h. Antoni López Saratxo (Baracaldo, 1996) fichó por la [Ponferradina](/temas/ponferradina) a finales de agosto con la liga ya iniciada. Los bercianos son terceros en Primera FEF y reciben al Lugo este domingo (20.00 horas, TVG2 y FEF TV). El pasado 31 de enero del 2023, fichó por el Lugo en Segunda, con el que jugó 16 partidos, 12 de ellos como titular. El lateral izquierdo debutó en Primera con el Athletic Club en la temporada 2017-2018 jugando como titular. —¿En qué momento de la temporada está la Ponferradina? —Afrontando la recta final, seguimos ahí en los puestos de arriba. El equipo se está dando cuenta que todo es más difícil, que las cosas se complican, que hasta los que están abajo ganan ahora más puntos. Estamos con mucha ilusión, nos vemos fuertes, nos vemos arriba. —¿Cómo valora su rendimiento individual? —Muy bien, estoy muy contento. Desde que llegué estoy muy contento con el proyecto. En las primeras semanas ya me di cuenta de la calidad humana que había en el vestuario y del nivel competitivo que podíamos tener. Estoy muy contento con lo que he podido aportar al equipo. Queda lo más bonito de la temporada. —¿En qué medida influyó en su fichaje Íñigo Vélez, que ya fue su primer entrenador en Amorebieta y en Lugo? —No tengo ni idea. La primera llamada la recibo del club. Antes de la llamada tuve ofertas de otros sitios, pero no se pudieron dar. Cuando recibí la llamada de aquí, con el proyecto que había, con compañeros que ya conocía y me hablaban muy bien del club, fue una ilusión tremenda. El objetivo es ambicioso, el club quiere volver a la categoría donde estaba el año pasado. Era un extra llegar y saber la filosofía del entrenador y que te conozca. Tener esa base evidentemente me ayudó. —¿Cómo es Íñigo Vélez como entrenador? —Bien. Es un entrenador que se fija mucho en la competitividad, que seamos un equipo rocoso juguemos mejor o peor, que sea difícil meternos mano, y creo que lo estamos consiguiendo. Somos uno de los equipos con menos goles encajados y llevamos muchas porterías a cero. Y luego que seamos fuertes en las transiciones. —¿Se encuentra más cómodo en defensa de cinco o de cuatro? —Depende de la filosofía y del perfil del equipo y de las características de los jugadores que tenga alrededor. Si me lo llegas a preguntar hace un par de años o mismamente el año pasado, te diría en línea de cuatro, pero ahora me da igual porque, incluso jugando en línea de cuatro, mis objetivos y mis características son prácticamente de hacer una línea de cinco. Ahora mismo en el fútbol tampoco cambia mucho la película. Sí puede cambiar en defensa porque te puedes sentir más arropado con un central más cerca, pero en ataque cuando un mediocentro baja a recibir y se mete entre centrales prácticamente te posicionas como un carrilero. No le doy mucha importancia, aunque haya variantes. Me adapto. —¿Y se ve jugando como interior por delante de otro lateral izquierdo? —Como interior... Sí he tenido situaciones en las que he tenido que jugar ahí como doble lateral. Sería en momentos muy, muy puntuales. Recuerdo en el Elche tener épocas y salir del banquillo en esa posición muchos minutos porque el partido lo requería. Soy lateral, soy carrilero. Incluso a veces me he encontrado más cómodo jugando como central en una línea de tres que de interior. —Fichó por la Ponferradina el 29 de agosto con la liga ya empezada. ¿Cómo fue su verano a nivel mental y la temporada pasada entre Tenerife y Lugo? —Complicado. Es la parte más difícil, no tener contrato en vigor. Ver que van saliendo opciones, parece que cada verano los clubes tardan más, los equipos a nivel de presupuesto tienen más problemas, los fichajes se hacen más tarde. El anterior fue mi primer verano sin contrato en vigor y terminé fichando en Tenerife el 31 de agosto. Este mercado igual no lo he pasado tan mal porque estuve a punto de fichar por dos o tres equipos y no pudo ser prácticamente en el último minuto. El verano pasado sí tenía la sensación de poder fichar. Cuando ves que los equipos empiezan la pretemporada, compañeros que te dicen cuándo empiezan, que pasa julio, que llega agosto, es complicado. Lo que quieres hacer es la pretemporada. —¿Tuvo opción de renovar por el Lugo? —No, no, no tuve ninguna. Acabamos la temporada y no tuve ninguna llamada, ningún mensaje ni nada. No sé si algún compañero tuvo llamada, pero no me consta. Estoy aquí con Pablo Clavería y tampoco la tuvo. Y hablando así con varios compañeros que estuvieron sin equipo durante el verano me consta que no tuvieron llamada del Lugo. —¿Qué destacaría de Pablo Clavería? —Tácticamente un jugador muy, muy bueno, muy solidario también, un trabajo enorme en el medio campo. Muchas veces no se aprecia desde fuera. Cuando está en el campo se nota. Maneja muy bien los tiempos del partido, tácticamente es muy ordenado, físicamente también, en el uno contra uno es fuerte, es difícil sobrepasarle. Un jugador como él siempre te da un equilibrio y unas posibilidades que no siempre son fáciles de encontrar. Contentísimo con él, con lo predispuesto que siempre está y a nivel humano es muy importante en el vestuario. —¿Cómo recuerda su media temporada en el Lugo? —Un poco empañado porque cuando me acoplo al equipo y a las ideas, la situación ya era muy difícil, pero fueron cinco meses en los que estuve muy a gusto y que la afición nos apoyó en la situación en la que estábamos. Tanto el vestuario como el club nos arropó. No tengo ni una mala palabra ni una queja. Es ahí cuando te das cuenta de que por qué clubes como el Lugo están tanto tiempo en Segunda. Llevaba diez años en Segunda. Te das cuenta de la calidad humana que había y eso es muy importante para conseguir el objetivo. —¿Cuando llega Íñigo se llegan a creer que el equipo se puede salvar? El equipo mejoró mucho defensivamente. —Sí, sí. Yo desde el principio sí veía mimbres para lograrlo. Sí tengo el recuerdo del partido del Racing en casa, nos hizo mucho daño. Fue de los partidos más difíciles a nivel mental que yo he sentido en mi vida porque teníamos un déficit muy importante en área contrario, cuando llega Íñigo cogemos esa solidez defensiva que en Segunda es vital. Hasta el día del Racing yo sí que veía opciones. Para mí, y creo que para el equipo en general, fue un palo muy gordo. Ponerte por delante en el marcador con lo que nos costaba y ese gol en el último minuto de córner, con una posible falta me hizo mucho daño. —¿Qué compañeros le llamaron más la atención de aquel Lugo? —El mismo Sebas Moyano que está haciendo un temporadón en Oviedo. Se lo merece. El año pasado también fue un jugador que sufrió mucho la situación, remó todo el año. Me alegro muchísimo por él. También Óscar (Whalley), Javier Avilés nos ayudó mucho arriba cuando llegó o (Josep) Señé. Éramos un grupo de jugadores que llevábamos años dando un nivel en Segunda, pero hay temporadas que se junta todo, que ves que no vas y no vas, también hubo lesiones. A nivel individual éramos un equipo muy sólido y muy competitivo. —Usted ficha por el Lugo el 31 de enero cuando se anuncia la dimisión de Carlos Pita, el cese de Fran Justo y el traspaso de Chris Ramos. ¿Quién o quiénes le llaman del Lugo para fichar? —Yo firmo y es el día que dimite Pita, sí. Tengo tres llamadas el 31 de enero. Una es de Wagner (Molina), otra es del presidente y la tercera de uno de los dos anteriores, no recuerdo cuál de los dos. —¿Le sorprendió el contexto del Lugo ese día? —Mi salida de Tenerife no estaba programada. Nadie me había dicho nada en Tenerife. Todo iba normal y el 31 de enero te enteras de todo. Fue todo súper tarde. El Tenerife me comunica a las diez de la noche que me va a rescindir. Cuando tengo la llamada del Lugo ni me lo pienso, era seguir en Segunda. No eran muchos puntos de desventaja (cinco). Ni me lo hubiese pensado ni estando a trece puntos de la salvación. Era una opción muy, muy buena para mí. Quería competir y jugar lo que no hice los primeros meses en Tenerife. Cuando llegas ves el traspaso de Chris Ramos, la dimisión de Pita y te das cuenta que hubo alboroto esos meses. —¿Percibió que fue uno de los jugadores más valorados por la afición del Lugo esos cuatro meses? —Sí, me sorprendió. Desde el primer día dejé claro que era un jugador que iba a dar todo, que no me iba a dejar un metro ni una carrera. Notaba en Lugo que la gente me apoyaba en el campo, que por la calle me daban muchos ánimos cuando lo normal, no es que sea todo lo contrario, pero que sean más reservados en una afición que estaba acostumbrada a diez años en Segunda y que había un descenso muy probable. Lo agradecí muchísimo. —¿Cómo vivió en la ciudad? —Hablé con varios compañeros, como Pablo Caballero. Pablo me había hablado espectacular de Lugo. Yo, siendo de Bilbao, me siento a gusto, como en casa. Gastronómicamente es espectacular, todo lo que tiene Lugo es espectacular, también sus alrededores y lo disfruté mucho. Estuve muy contento, muy contento. —¿Cómo recuerda su debut en Primera con el Athletic? Titular en Girona en febrero de 2018. —Con el tiempo y con los años le he dado no más valor, pero más orgullo. Estaba haciendo una temporada muy buena en el Bilbao Athletic, pero ves que el puesto en el primer equipo está muy bien cubierto. Entonces, no te vuelves loco. Sigues con tu trabajo en el Bilbao Athletic. Teníamos un filial súper competitivo, estábamos arriba, luchando por subir a Segunda. Fue todo muy rápido. Una llamada un lunes para empezar a entrenar con el primer equipo. Fue la segunda vez que me llamaban. Iba a entrenar y me decían que viniese el día siguiente, al día siguiente lo mismo. El jueves o el viernes se me acercan los pesos pesados, como Aritz Aduriz, Raúl García e Iker Muniain y ya empezaron con la comidilla: “Estate preparado para jugar el domingo, vas al ruedo”. En ese momento la cabeza me da un giro y ya es diferente, no piensas tanto en la ilusión, sino en una responsabilidad brutal. Mi sentido de pertenencia al Athletic es enorme, para mí es sagrado, es la vida. Se te mete dentro y no lo disfrutas tanto como lo deberías disfrutar. Lo disfrutas más a posteriori, a las dos o tres semanas te dices: “Debuté con el primer equipo”. Después con el tiempo te vas dando cuenta. El día del partido y los días anteriores esa responsabilidad te come. —¿Qué fue lo que más le impactó de aquel partido? ¿El ritmo? ¿Algún compañero o rival? —Sí, sobre todo la competitividad. El Girona, ya en aquel momento, aunque no con los resultados de ahora, tenía ya el perfil de tener mucho el balón, mucha verticalidad por fuera. Yo durante la semana me sentí muy a gusto con el ritmo, veía que el ritmo no me superaba. Siempre me he considerado un jugador que podía no tener problemas en el aspecto físico, pero cuando llega la competición sí te sorprende en los primeros momentos. Te llega el balón y acostumbrado a tener al rival a cinco metros, lo tenía ya a uno y medio. Si antes de recibir el balón no sabías qué hacer con él podías tener problemas. Entrenar con ellos te ayuda porque te da en la competición ese punto extra. Tengo el recuerdo de los primeros minutos, cuando tenía el balón ver que aquello iba a una velocidad diferente a la que yo estaba acostumbrado.",
