Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab at Texas A&M University, has spent over 30 years researching the compound.\nCreatine, a naturally occurring compound found in muscle, combines with phosphate to form creatine phosphate, a key player in cellular energy production. While the body produces about a gram of creatine daily, experts recommend an intake of 2 to 4 grams per day based on activity level and muscle mass. Because dietary creatine primarily comes from meat and fish, supplementation is especially beneficial for vegetarians and vegans.\nKreider also emphasized its importance across the lifespan. “Creatine is important for everyone as they age,” he said. It may help mitigate age-related declines in muscle mass and cognitive function. In adolescents, low dietary creatine has been linked to slower growth and higher body fat.\nContrary to lingering myths, creatine’s safety is well-supported. “There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” said Kreider. He added that supposed side effects like bloating or cramping have not been substantiated and, in fact, creatine may help reduce cramping by improving hydration.\nAs Kreider and his colleagues continue to advocate for creatine’s safe use, they urge that its benefits be made accessible to all—not just athletes.\nReference: Richard B.

    "text": "HYDERABAD: Spacetech startup Dhruva Space is all set to kick off the new year with a bang. The Hyderabad-based startup’s Leap-TD (Launching Expeditions for Aspiring Payloads-Technology Demonstrator) mission is scheduled to blast off onboard the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) PSLV-C58 Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on the morning of January 1, 2024.\nThe mission will see the Hyderabad-based Dhruva Space validate the functionality and robustness of its flagship P-30 nanosatellite platform and its sub-systems in-orbit. The P-30 platform is designed for low earth orbit (LEO) operations and will be a determining enabler in the spacetech company’s upcoming satellite missions, it said.\nThese subsystems include on-board computer, telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C ) in ultra high frequency (UHF), beacon in UHF, attitude control system with a reaction wheel and power distribution board. Dhruva Space will also be collaborating with the Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology (IIST), Thiruvananthapuram, for carrying out TT&C activities.\n“We are excited about the imminent validation of our P-30 nanosatellite platform aboard ISRO’s PSLV-C58. The Leap initiative marks a significant moment, underscoring our commitment to delivering full-stack and hosted payload solutions to our customers. This will be further enriched by new, upcoming pursuits in the fields of earth observation IoT solutions and more,” Dhruva Space founder & CEO Sanjay Nekkanti said.\nDhruva Space said the Leap-TD mission features a derivative of its P-30 satellite platform that is integrated to ISRO’s PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) which will allow in-orbit scientific experiments using the spent PS4 stage as an orbital platform.\nIt said the Leap initiative will then transition into full-fledged hosted payload solutions for space missions, signifying Dhruva Space’s readiness to offer hosted payload services, which comprises a portion of a satellite such as a sensor, instrument or a set of communication transponders owned by its customers. The hosted portion of the satellite operates independently of the main spacecraft but shares the satellite’s power supply, transponders and also ground systems in some cases, it explained.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.

    "title": "Dining Review: Hai Noon is Spectacular",
    "text": "With a PHOENIX Magazine 2023 Best New Restaurant of the Year award under his arm, Nobuo Fukuda keeps finding fresh ways to beguile our critic. by Nikki Buchanan | Photography by Mirelle Inglefield Last April, Welcome Diner owner Sloane McFarland and legendary chef Nobuo Fukuda opened Hai Noon without fanfare in a refurbished ’60s-era motor lodge called Sonder the Mariposa in South Scottsdale. At first blush, the narrow space, a dimly lit, rock-walled bar, seemed an unlikely venue for Fukuda, a 2007 James Beard Best Chef Southwest award winner revered for his fusion-y take on Japanese cuisine. However, I instantly fell in love with its retro look and relaxed vibe, finding it the perfect hangout for Japanese-inspired cocktails, curated sake and affordable small plates such as Fukuda’s signature pork belly buns, softshell crab sandwich and coconut curried lamb. To have a chef of this caliber back in action and turning out many of his brilliant greatest hits after a two-year hiatus seemed such a blessing that we awarded Hai Noon Best New Restaurant of the Year last November. Now that the partners have resurrected Fukuda’s equally famous omakase, there’s even more reason to visit this hipster hideaway. It’s a seven-course prix fixe menu priced at $200 per person and offered on Sundays at the bar, where the chef personally serves and explains every dish. For my money, or somebody else’s money, it’s the best way to get an overview of Fukuda’s inimitable style. The daily-driver menu is fantastic, but this is possibly the greatest dining experience you can have on a Sunday in Phoenix. (Call ahead at least a week in advance, the restaurant recommends.) Round one is a quartet of vegetables: sunomono, a salad of watermelon radish and Japanese cucumber, gently pickled in wasabi-plum vinaigrette splashed with dashi (Japan’s ubiquitous fish stock); baked eggplant, topped with jammy bacon miso; cauliflower florets set in a nutty puddle of sesame sauce; and grilled shishitos, sprinkled with queso fresco, pomegranate and smoky katsuobushi (bonito flakes). The second course is classic Nobuo – a half dozen ceramic spoons filled with wildly imaginative sashimi arranged from lightest to heaviest on the palate. If you love round umami flavors (and who doesn’t?), you’ll want to live right here. To begin, a plump, sweet Shigoku oyster topped with creamy mascarpone and set afloat in bracing tomato water reduction. Citrus-cured salmon topped with Parmesan and a single almond rests in a puddle of wasabi, mint and basil oil. Lightly seared big eye tuna, as rich and fatty as steak, sits in a crimson purée of beets, boozed up with Pinot Noir reduction – a Fukuda signature for good reason. The fourth spoon contains buri-hira, which Fukuda describes as “what happens when yellowtail (buri) and hiramasa have a baby.” Its flesh is firm, sweet and fatty, luscious with buttery avocado and a grapefruit supreme to cut its richness. Next up: a new one, to me: tuna, marinated in soy sauce and nattō (fermented soybeans) until it’s dark and silky with a hint of funk; and then the final spoon shooter, a palate-refreshing buri-hira given a quick, ceviche-like lime marinade, then rolled up with mint-like shiso leaf and garnished with crispy shredded taro. Maitake and shiitake mushrooms with trottole pasta are offered on the regular menu, bundled in special cooking cellophane (a modern version of en papillote) and served bubbling hot in an ambrosial broth of sake, soy, garlic and butter. For omakase, Fukuda adds impossibly sweet Hokkaido scallops, grating yuzu zest over the top for even more fragrance and citrusy lift. However, course four is the knockout of the evening: a whole fish (called nodoguro or blackthroat), deconstructed and artfully arranged on a platter. Tiny fish balls (meatballs of fish parts most people throw away) are sweet, crunchy morsels to pop in the mouth, while sashimi comes three ways: firm, lean pieces cut from the back of the fish, soft and fatty ones from the belly, still others kelp-cured for a boost of umami flavor. All are lightly torched until the skins are crisped and glistening. Fukuda cooks a few of the odd bits on a hibachi in front of us, urging us to eat everything but the eyeballs, and we do, savoring the sweetness and crunch that caramelization brings to the spine, fins, head (including luscious cheeks) and tail. This is nose-to-tail dining from the ocean. Course five – a tiny half quail, roasted and ruddy from a dry rub of 18 spices, black vinegar and molasses – is packed with aromatics and gone in minutes. For the last savory course, Fukuda takes a rustic Japanese classic called hoba-yaki – miso cooked over binchotan (Japanese charcoal) on a hoba leaf – adding duck breast and shimeji mushrooms. The mixture cooks on the hibachi until the miso bubbles and the nutty, smoky flavors from both leaf and charcoal are imparted to the meat. The final course, four fantastic desserts, includes a palate-cleansing ginger-grapefruit sorbet; whiskey-coffee ice cream (give me this all day); tofu-based chocolate mole mousse, jacked up with Chimayó chile; and a light, crisp almond fritter drizzled with black sesame caramel. This has been a spectacular meal – and arguably a bargain, given the rare and hard-to-source ingredients at hand. I’ll put your money on it. Cuisine: Japanese Hai Noon Contact: 7017 E.

This is nose-to-tail dining from the ocean. Course five – a tiny half quail, roasted and ruddy from a dry rub of 18 spices, black vinegar and molasses – is packed with aromatics and gone in minutes. For the last savory course, Fukuda takes a rustic Japanese classic called hoba-yaki – miso cooked over binchotan (Japanese charcoal) on a hoba leaf – adding duck breast and shimeji mushrooms. The mixture cooks on the hibachi until the miso bubbles and the nutty, smoky flavors from both leaf and charcoal are imparted to the meat. The final course, four fantastic desserts, includes a palate-cleansing ginger-grapefruit sorbet; whiskey-coffee ice cream (give me this all day); tofu-based chocolate mole mousse, jacked up with Chimayó chile; and a light, crisp almond fritter drizzled with black sesame caramel. This has been a spectacular meal – and arguably a bargain, given the rare and hard-to-source ingredients at hand. I’ll put your money on it. Cuisine: Japanese",

    "title": "聯邦政府又裁員！美國衛生及公共服務部「將開除1萬名全職員工」",
    "text": "圖、文／CTWANT\n▲美國衛生及公共服務部27日宣布，將裁減旗下衛生機構共1萬名全職員工。（圖／翻攝IG＠自馬斯克）\n美國衛生及公共服務部（HHS）於美東時間27日宣布將裁減旗下衛生機構共1萬名全職員工。該部門向CNN表示，此舉是在已有1萬名員工自願離職的基礎上實施的，這導致HHS的總人力已從約8.2萬人縮減至6.2萬人。\n據CNN的報導，各州及地方衛生部門表示，新冠疫情期間啟動的聯邦補助突然終止令他們措手不及。某州官員更形容此舉已帶來「不確定性與混亂」。此外，約5200名任職未滿1至2年的試用期員工已於上月底遭解僱。HHS發言人尼克森（Andrew Nixon）指出，多數人現處於行政休假狀態，等待聯邦法院裁定去留，這批人員不包含在最新公告中。\n《華爾街日報》率先報導此裁員計劃。HHS在聲明中指出，他們將把28個部門整併為15個，包括新成立的「健康美國管理局」（A new Administration for a Healthy America，AHA），並將區域辦公室從10個縮減至5個，該機構稱此舉可節省每年18億美元。\nHHS強調新工作重點將是「透過關注安全食品、潔淨水源及消除環境毒素，終結美國慢性病流行」。HHS部長小羅伯特·F·甘迺迪在聲明中表示：「這不僅是精簡官僚體系，更是讓組織重新聚焦核心使命。我們將以更低成本達成更多目標。」但該部門同時保證，聯邦醫療保險（Medicare）、聯邦醫療補助（Medicaid）等基本服務在聯邦機構重組中「不受影響」。\n裁員消息公布後，公共衛生專家警告，基於現有工作量，以及州和地方衛生部門資金銳減、聯邦醫療補助可能縮編，維持服務水準將極其困難。非營利組織「德博蒙特基金會」（de Beaumont）基金會總裁卡斯特魯奇（Brian Castrucci）質疑：「精簡預算雖好，但若導致孩子挨餓就本末倒置了。不知HHS還剩多少人力能推動『讓美國再次健康』（Make America Healthy Again）計劃。」\n事後小羅伯特·F·甘迺迪在社交平台X發布影片承認，HHS的縮編將是一段「痛苦的過程」，但他承諾會提升效率，以有限資源聚焦新的使命，並強調：「HHS不會遺棄任何美國公民」，同時要求員工每日自省「今天能為恢復國民健康做出什麼貢獻？」\nCNN為此也列出HHS旗下衛生機構的具體裁員範圍，包括：\n食品藥物管理局（FDA）：3500人（不影響藥品、醫材及食品審查員） 疾病管制與預防中心（CDC）：2400人 國家衛生研究院（NIH）：採購、人資及傳播部門裁1200人 醫療保險與補助服務中心（CMS）：300人 組織重整亮點是新設立的「健康美國管理局」（AHA），整合5個現有機構，專注基層醫療、婦幼健康、心理健康等領域。HHS還將新增執法助理部長職位，並成立策略辦公室強化政策研究。\n前HHS員工透露，CMS個案管理團隊將受重創，影響《聯邦醫療保險優勢計劃》和《平價醫療法案》投保人的服務品質。員工解僱通知最快在28日發出，預計5月27日生效，主要針對行政、IT等高成本區域及重複性職位。\n對此，美國政府僱員聯合會與國家財政部僱員聯合會均強烈反對該計劃，後者更譴責此舉將「危及全國家庭健康安全」。前CMS署長布魯克斯-拉蘇爾（Chiquita Brooks-LaSure）將裁員比喻為「拆除房屋用的破壞球」（Wrecking Ball），警告這無助改善醫療可及性。\n美國公共衛生協會執行主任本傑明博士（Dr. Georges Benjamin）指出，公共衛生機構士氣已因過重的工作量「跌至歷史低點」。他預測這些變革將「惡化而非改善美國人的平均預期壽命」，並批評：「聯邦摧毀自身體制之餘，連帶癱瘓了州和地方的應變能力。」\n凱撒家庭基金會（KFF）健康政策副總裁萊維特（Larry Levitt）也示警，裁員「終將影響公共服務，由民眾和醫療提供者承擔後果」。美國婦產科醫師學會（ACOG）會長丹塔斯博士（Dr. Stella Dantas）更直言，這是「對公共健康的攻擊」，其破壞效應將持續波及全美民眾。\n代表低收入醫療機構的美國核心醫院協會（America's Essential Hospitals）也憂心，重組可能「損害有效服務患者所需的基礎建設」。該組織政策副總裁菲爾德普什（Beth Feldpush）強調，聯邦支援對保障弱勢族群就醫權益至關重要。\n延伸閱讀",

    "title": "Isiah Thomas Scoffs At Lou Williams’ Claim That LeBron James Could Win 15 Straight NBA Titles Starting 1975",
    "text": "Basketball fans under 30 are the prominent voice on social media. Many partook in the ‘ [We Done with the 90s](/nba-news-shaquille-oneal-responds-to-90s-michael-jordan-memes-on-social-media-using-wilt-chamberlain-as-example/)‘ trend, which downplayed the skill and talent of players in the 1990s and prior. This unsurprisingly irked analysts, former players, and fans who witnessed that era. Most took up arms, in this case, their keyboards, to defend their era, including Hall of Famer [Isiah Thomas](/tag/isiah-thomas/). Advertisement The Pistons icon came across an X post that quoted retired NBA star Lou Williams saying, “Drop LeBron James in 1975 and he’d win 15 straight championships.” The former Clippers star made that remark in 2019 during an appearance on the No Chill Podcast. He claimed that the NBA changes massively every decade. Any star would dominate if they could time travel 10 years back from when their career began. He then stated that James’ size and athletic ability would automatically make him the best player in the 1970s. However, Thomas felt the statement was too reductive. He scoffed at Williams’ take and wrote, “I find it comical and laughable how some not all people think this is the first generation of basketball players that athletically could run and jump. I’m not sure he would be the best athlete in 1975 all things being equal.” I find it comical and laughable how some not all people think this is the first generation of basketball players that athletically could run and jump. I'm not sure he would be the best athlete in 1975 all things being equal. [https://t.co/U9vsBfoHG8] — Isiah Thomas (@IsiahThomas) [July 25, 2024] He didn’t deny that James would be the most skilled player in the 1970s. However, he disagreed that players in that decade weren’t athletic or physically gifted. Thomas has never shied away from defending the era he played in and the one he grew up watching. Isiah Thomas defends 20th-century basketball After his verbal tirade about Williams’ comment, the Hall of Famer scrolled through the replies to his post to hunt for fans who agreed with him. He shared replies that had photos of players from the 1970s like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar showing their otherwordly athleticism. Great photos of unbelievable athleticism [https://t.co/wZ4JiXe3tt] — Isiah Thomas (@IsiahThomas) [July 25, 2024] The Pistons icon doesn’t only believe that stars in the 20th century were as athletic as the stars of today, he even claimed that the greats from yesteryears struck more fear in the hearts of their opponents than the biggest names today do. During an appearance on the Point Forward podcast, he used Larry Bird as an example to explain his point. He said, “Like every time Larry Bird caught the basketball, it’s like, ‘Oh, sh*t!’ He didn’t do nothing but we was like ‘Oh, he got it! He got the basketball’ And the type of fear that puts into you and then that type of fear makes you do something stupid defensively.” Every fan believes the era they grew up watching was competitive. Only a handful can enjoy each era for what it was rather than indulge in superfluous debates on social media. However, as Thomas proved, even a Hall of Famer isn’t above getting sucked into arguments with no conclusions.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) London-based bank donates $50,000 to Sally Ann A London, Ont.-based financial institution has made a significant contribution to the Salvation Army. VersaBank has named the Salvation Army its newest flagship charity, donating $50,000. Salvation Army officials said the money actually came in back in October, and was matched by an anonymous donor. They estimate one in five Canadians are dealing with food insecurity right now. Last year, food banks and support programs served more than five million people a month. That number is expected to grow by 60 per cent for this year. VersaBank's President and CEO is encouraging other organizations to support similar initiatives. \"There's a lot of need, particularly in the city of London for food and accommodation for homeless people,” David Taylor told CTV News. “Thankfully in the past, we had a hand in creating the centre of hope for the Salvation Army, and we just thought it just sort of moves any organization that's making a few dollars to give back as best we can to help out the less fortunate people particularly around Christmas time,” he said.
