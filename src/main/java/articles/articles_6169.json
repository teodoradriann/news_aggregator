    "text": "Rabbi Neil Brief, led Skokie congregation for 33 years, dies Rabbi Neil Brief at Ezra-Habonim on June 28, 2018. (Pioneer Press photo) 4:56 p.m. | UPDATED: 5:34 p.m.\nRabbi Neil Brief served at Ezra-Habonim, the Niles Township Jewish Congregation in Skokie, for 33 years and developed a reputation for building bridges with other faiths.\n“He was incredibly welcoming, compassionate and kind, and he was non-judgmental, which is very important in a rabbi,” said Cook County Judge Shelley Sutker-Dermer, the congregation’s president. “He had such pride in being part of our congregation. He was just a mensch.”\nBrief, 89, died Jan. 27 at the Carrington at Lincolnwood assisted living community in Lincolnwood, said Rabbi Jeffrey Weill of Ezra-Habonim, the Niles Township Jewish Congregation. Brief was a longtime Skokie resident.\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Brief began rabbinical school in New York in 1955 and attended New York University and Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion before serving in the Army for two years as a chaplain at an Army base in Arizona. One of Brief’s rabbinical school classmates, A. James Rudin, would go on to become inter-religious director for the American Jewish Committee.\n“He was the kid from Brooklyn — ebullient, joyful, playful and very smart, and we became rabbis together in 1960,” Rudin recalled. “He was very knowledgeable about Judaism but he had this wonderful quality of reaching out to anybody and everybody.”\nBrief served for 11 years at synagogues in Arizona and California. In 1971, he was hired to lead what then was known as Niles Township Jewish Congregation. The synagogue later merged with another synagogue and added the name Ezra-Habonim.\n“There was a real comfort level here,” Brief told the Tribune in a 2016 interview, reflecting on his family’s reception in Skokie. “We grew very comfortable in this community. We made friends quickly.”\nIn a 133-page biography of Brief, written by a family friend, Judith-Rae Ross, and published in 2018, Brief recounted that when asked in 1971 what he had wanted to accomplish in Skokie, he answered, “a rabbi. No more, no less.” That answer became the title of Ross’ book, “Neil Brief: A Rabbi; No More, No less.”\n“When speaking on sin and shortcomings, he speaks of forgiveness and redemption,” Ross wrote. “An expert in Gematria (numerology), Rabbi Brief is more likely to give the ‘good word of the day,’ based on its numerical equivalent, rather than a quote from Leviticus.”\nIn Skokie, Brief was known for spearheading the creation of the Niles Township Clergy Forum, which he later served as president. From that group formed an annual interfaith service, held the night before Thanksgiving each year.\nWithin his congregation, Brief “sought warmth and intimacy with and for this community,” Weill said.\n“He liked to connect people and he did so in truly the warmest and most authentic way and with the most authentic, genuine desire to bring folks together,” Weill said. “His rabbinate was based on relationships — that’s what it was about for him.”\nSutker-Dermer recalled Brief’s presence in his congregation members’ “life cycle events,” and she marveled at his ability to remember dates such as birthdays and anniversaries.\n“If he spent a life cycle event with you, he didn’t forget it,” she said. “He was a numerologist, and he would talk about the significance of the date.”\nBrief also took aim at hatred and division in his community: The fight over a neo-Nazi group’s 1978 attempt to march in Skokie, a predominantly Jewish suburb; the antisemitic graffiti spray-painted on a Holocaust monument in Skokie in 1987; a Ku Klux Klan rally held in 2000 on the steps of the Cook County courthouse in Skokie.\nThe graffiti appeared one day after Skokie dedicated the Holocaust memorial, and the day after that, Brief was part of a decision to hold a memorial service at the monument to try to understand what had happened. He even suggested leaving the graffiti on the monument, at least for a time, to allow people to think about what had been done.\n“This is not the best way to make this place holy, but this place has now become holy ground,” Brief told the Tribune at the time. “As Rabbi (Lewis) Tuchman observed, the very act of its defilement is this memorial’s justification.”\nAnd after the 2000 Klan rally and a counter-rally the following day, Brief told the Tribune, “I almost wish I could have been at that courthouse to say to the KKK, ‘Come in from the cold and stop spewing that dirt.’ Skokie is not a Jew town. It is an American town.”\nBoth Sutker-Dermer and Rudin highlighted the ways that Brief built and fostered community, both within his congregation and beyond it.\n“He set a mark for friendliness and real scholarship at the same time,” Rudin said. “That’s a unique combination.”\nBrief retired from his congregation in 2004 but remained active in it until his death, serving as rabbi emeritus.\nBrief also was a community volunteer with the Skokie Commission on Family Services, the Rotary Club, the United Way of Skokie Valley and other service organizations.\nBrief’s wife of more than 57 years, Erica, died in 2014. He is survived by two daughters, Dena Wald and Debra Hoffen; a son, David; a brother, Seymour; 10 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren;\nA service was held.\nGoldsborough is a freelance reporter.

We’ll be able to help them recognize the different medicine, food sources, plants, and animals that need to be protected,” said Buck Cruz, the Washoe Tribe project manager. An opportunity to promote cultural burning, land stewardship and forest maintenance. Fire crews receive hands-on training in operating a fire engine, deploying a fire hose, and pumping water. “These are really important if you’re in a scenario where you can’t get an engine out. It’s nice to be able to put that little draft hose into a body of water and use that to supply water,” said Brandon Cobb with The Nature Conservancy. Along with career-building. “All of this is possible for them. Anybody can come out here and join wildland fire and start that connection. All it is is them taking that step. There are plenty of regular people that join and having those natives build that connection between that forest service and the native tribe is something that is important,” added Campbell. The project manager for the Washoe Tribe’s Conservation Corps, Buck Cruz, says this provides avenues for their native knowledge not to be forgotten. “Our medicine people, they prayed over these fires. A lot of these people here now today, pray to this fire. They recognize it as a living entity and living forest.” Copyright 2024 KOLO. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "ELLIJAY, GA, USA, December 28, 2023 /EINPresswire.com/ -- fluidIQ, a MedTech company developing fluidics-based respiratory solutions, reflects on its 2023 accomplishments while looking forward to achieving initial commercialization in 2024. The year marked advances for the company, its technology and related research and positioned it in front of important audiences â including at major medical conferences, investor meetings and in presentations to government agencies. Award-Winning Innovation fluidIQ received an award from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and was invited to join the respected group. âfluidIQ was honored to receive the prestigious MTEC Innovation Award and is proud to now be an active member of MTEC,â said Matt Vogelhuber, R.Ph., Chief Executive Officer of fluidIQ. MTEC is a public-private partnership that is authorized to serve by the Department of Defense to promote the development and delivery of innovative medical technologies to improve the health and safety of military personnel, veterans and civilians. fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ was created by emergency medical and respiratory professionals working with world-class engineers to provide resuscitation and emergency breathing without reliance on traditional manual techniques and tools; recent NIH-supported study findings suggest improved techniques for rescue breathing could save more lives. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-finds-poor-ventilation-use-during-cpr-out-hospital-cardiac-arrest#:~:text=The%20ventilation%20technique%2C%20also%20known,rates%2C%20according%20to%20a%20study Providing benefits of automation without the need for electricity or batteries, HOPE inVentâ¢ harnesses the science of fluidics -- uses air or fluids to operate things automatically -- to provide breathing support to patients who are unable to breathe on their own. Presenting Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) invited fluidIQ to conduct a TechWatch presentation to multiple government departments and agencies earlier this year. BARDA promotes the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect Americans and respond to 21st Century health security threats. fluidIQ researchers were invited to present at both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) meetings to share findings of international research efforts featuring the companyâs HOPE inVentâ¢ technology. fluidIQ was also chosen to present at the Respiratory Innovation Summit (RIS), hosted by the American Thoracic Society, a meeting that historically attracts 275+ global leaders representing all facets of the respiratory industry, including representatives from startups, business development, venture capital, government, academia and clinical medicine. Partnering Meanwhile, fluidIQ continued its collaborative research agreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, a collaboration that will soon be in its fourth year. The NIH expects to conduct a first-in-humans study early in 2024. Late last year, the NIH research with fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ device was published in Science Translational Medicine. In addition, the NIH Directorâs blog featured the technology: (https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2022/11/29/clinical-center-doctors-testing-3d-printed-miniature-ventilator/) and included details about the technology on its website (https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/creating-easy-use-portable-ventilator.) fluidIQ celebrated its second year partnering with Intersurgical U.S. (previously known as Pulmodyne) further developing fluidIQâs pipeline of respiratory products. fluidIQ is proud to be an active member of Securing Americaâs Medicines and Supply (SAMS), a multi-industry coalition of companies with the mission to strengthen the security of the medical supply chain in the United States. https://samscoalition.org The companyâs tiny three-inch-tall resuscitator/ventilator was highlighted at a national competition by partner, Diversified Plastics, Inc., that presented fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ to Additive Manufacturing User Groupâs (AMUG) Technical Competition under the title âHOPE inVentâ¢ fluidIQ: The New Era of Emergency Resuscitation.â [see video of device in operation on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amug_amug-amugtechcomp-amug2024-activity-7137824586582167553-54FC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios] Positioning Nearly four years since its founding, fluidIQ is well-positioned for another year of progress and momentum. âWe continue to gain momentum and achieve milestones even in what has been a tumultuous time for many startups,â said Vogelhuber. âOur team looks back at 2023 with a sense of accomplishment and looks forward with much anticipation and excitement to 2024.â The companyâs first medical device, HOPE inVentâ¢ was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) via a DeNovo application in the spring of this year and is currently under review. The company is working towards reaching commercialization in the emergency medicine including patient transport following clearance.

    "text": "The Telegraph Flt Lt ‘Rusty’ Waughman, Lancaster pilot who survived the most dangerous bombing raids of the war – obituary Read full article Telegraph Obituaries 29 December 2023 at 2:33 pm · 6-min read Waughman: his Lancaster was turned upside down by an explosion but he managed to right it, after plummeting to 1000 feet\nFlight Lieutenant ‘Rusty’ Waughman, who has died aged 100, completed a tour of operations as the pilot of a Lancaster bomber on a squadron that suffered some of the highest casualties of the Second World War.\nIn 1943, Waughman and his crew joined 101 Squadron, which operated Lancasters equipped with a special apparatus that searched out and then jammed enemy radio transmissions. To operate this equipment and transmit spurious messages to German night-fighter pilots, a specially trained German-speaking operator accompanied the crew. The Lancaster’s transmissions, however, allowed German night fighters to intercept the bomber, and the attrition rate on 101 Squadron was one of the highest in Bomber Command.\nOn the night of March 30/31 1944, Waughman’s crew joined 794 other bombers to attack Nuremburg. On a cloudless night, the German night fighters caused havoc with the bomber stream and Bomber Command suffered its biggest loss of the war, with 95 bombers failing to return. Waughman described the sight of falling bombers as “spectacular and very frightening”.\nTwo weeks later, on April 10/11 1944, Waughman’s crew were sent to bomb the railway system at Hasselt in Belgium. Nearing the target, another Lancaster collided with their aircraft, causing extensive damage. Waughman managed to maintain control, bombed the target and returned to make a crash landing. The other Lancaster fell away and crashed.\nDuring the next few weeks, Bomber Command flew many sorties in preparation for the impending Normandy invasion, targeting transportations systems and storage areas, notably the large German military camp and armament storage area near the French village at Mailly-le-Camp, which was attacked on the night of May 3/4. Due to radio problems, orders from the Master Bomber were confusing and the 346 Lancasters had to orbit the target, which gave German night fighters time to attack.\n'Rusty' Waughman Seconds after bombing the target, another bomber flew below Waughman’s Lancaster and then exploded, throwing their aircraft onto its back. They plummeted to 1,000 feet and exceeded the maximum permitted speed for the Lancaster, but Waughman managed to execute what he called “a very poor barrel roll”, with the help of the flight engineer, and right the aircraft without stalling.\nStory continues The raid was a success, but 42 bombers were lost, almost 12 percent of the force sent out on the mission.\nThe son of a Royal Navy seaman decorated in the First World War, Russell ‘Rusty’ Reay Waughman was born on January 19 1923 at Shotley Bridge, County Durham, and educated in Newcastle. In May 1941 he joined the RAF and trained in Canada as a pilot as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. On his return to England he converted to bombers.\nAt the bomber training unit, he formed a crew, drawn from different backgrounds and from across the UK, with a rear gunner from Canada, but “we all gelled”. The oldest was 26; Waughman, at 20, was the second oldest. His navigator was only 18, having “adjusted” his date of birth when joining the RAF. In later life, Waughman spoke of the comradeship of this “band of brothers”. Five of them met regularly in later life, and gathered for their respective 80th birthdays.\nWaughman and his crew performed well on the Lancaster and were sent to join 101 Squadron at Ludford Magna near Lincoln in October 1943. Their arrival coincided with the beginning of the second phase of the Battle of Berlin. They visited the “Big City” several times and carried out other long-range bombing operations.\nOver Munich, their Lancaster was damaged, and they had to return without an air speed indicator, landing after almost 10 hours in the air; finding themselves flying over France in daylight, they saw “two little specks” coming towards them, but they turned out to be Spitfires, sent to escort them home.\nThen, on a raid over Stettin, Waughman’s Lancaster was hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the crew limped back to base on two and a half engines. They arrived so late that they were assumed missing: “the committee of adjustment had been in and started to take our kit away,” he recalled.\nHis final sortie was on the night of D-Day, June 5/6 1944. The squadron launched 21 Lancasters to jam wireless communications and prevent enemy night fighters from being directed against the airborne invasion forces.\nWaughman and his crew had flown 30 operations and were the first in six months to complete a tour, such had been the casualty rates on the squadron. He was awarded the DFC. He always regretted that none of his crew were decorated. “They kept us all alive, they were doing exactly the same job as I was doing, under the same circumstances,” he said. “Same risks, but nothing.”\nIn later life, Waughman spoke frankly about the first time he felt terror – a “most peculiar” experience – on an operation to the Ruhr, “the old Happy Valle” as they called it. “We were approaching the area and it really looked deadly... The flak was so thick you could get out and walk on it... Searchlights, fighters around,” he recalled.\n“I literally was shaking, and I couldn’t do what I was supposed to do, so I dropped my seat so I couldn’t see outside and, funnily enough, I said a little prayer that I hadn’t said since I was about six years old. Why I said it I don’t know [but] the terror disappeared and I raised my seat, and I could just carry on. You’re still frightened, of course, but all the terror disappeared.”\nAfter completing his time on 101 Squadron, he became a flying instructor before converting to the Dakota. He continued instructing and in February 1947 was sent to Oakington, near Cambridge, where he became the station’s flying training officer for four Dakota squadrons. With the beginning of the Berlin Air Lift, he flew training and crew standardisation sorties, on some occasions spending 10 hours in the air. He later took part in the Airlift, flying many re-supply missions from the forward RAF airfield at Fassbergf in West Germany. He was awarded the AFC.\nAfter the airlift, Waughman was posted to Abingdon to join 30 Squadron to become the squadron’s training officer. The squadron had a VIP flying role and it was Waughman’s task to check all the pilots on instrument flying.\nWhen his young wife Pat was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he resigned from the RAF in 1953 to take care of her until her death 10 months later. He spent the next 27 years in sales and marketing for a packing company.\nIn 1990 five of his crew met at Ludford Magna before travelling to RAF Coningsby as guests of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, where they were re-united with the Lancaster. Earlier this year he returned to Coningsby where he met the King at a reunion for Bomber Command veterans. The French Government awarded him the French Legion d’Honneur and he was a strong supporter of the Royal Air Force Association in Leamington.\nHe was also a silversmith, and micro-mounted gem stones onto jewellery.\nRusty Waughman’s second wife Diana died in 2007. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.\nRusty Waughman, born January 19 1923, died December 14 2023\nTRENDING Davina McCall stormed off Masked Singer after close friend was unmasked Yahoo TV UK · 2-min read Wealthy businessman who secretly filmed himself having sex with woman has to pay £500 in damages The Telegraph · 3-min read Tractor driver who tried to save three men stuck in 4x4 says they were ‘swept away’ by River Esk The Independent · 2-min read Putin sends revenge squads into Crimea after destruction of warship The Telegraph · 3-min read 'Sudden stratospheric warming' forecast to hit northern Europe in January - but experts unsure where it will strike Sky News · 3-min read",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) [#19](c19#c-19) \"En la Torá se afirma claramente que el hombre fue creado con un propósito concreto: emular la justicia Divina sobre la Tierra. En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
