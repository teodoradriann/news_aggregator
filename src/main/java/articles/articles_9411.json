Scientists have likened it to \"a big sneeze by the Sun\" .\nAs the particles collide with the gases, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky.\nPeople from across the region sent images to the BBC.\nHoly Island, at Northumberland, saw particularly vivid skies, while the Lake District was another spot for dramatic illuminations.\nPA Media The refuge hut on the causeway leading to Holy Island, Northumberland Mark Hetherington Warnscale Bothy in Buttermere, Cumbria Ian McClelland Newbottle, Sunderland PA Media Holy Island, Northumberland Daphne Eddington Braithwaite, Cumbria Mark Hetherington Tewet Tarn near Keswick, Cumbria Jonathan Kellager Cullercoats, North Tyneside Nigel Craig Threlkeld, Cumbria Carolyn Farthing-Dunn Shotley Bridge, County Durham B Dabbous Yarm, Stockton-on-Tees Follow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram .

    "text": "Matías Rojas podría demandar a Corinthians e irse libre El atacante paraguayo, que llegó al Timao a mediados de este año, amenaza con declararse en libertad de acción si los brasileños no regularizan su situación. A menos de seis meses de su llegada al Corinthians, Matías Rojas se encuentra en conflicto con el club de Brasil y podría declararse en libertad de acción si el Timao no se pone al día con una deuda que tiene para con el futbolista paraguayo. Según la prensa brasileña, la cifra que le debe el club al 10 ronda el millón de dólares. Rojas, que en julio firmó como futbolista libre con Corinthians tras el final de su vínculo con Racing, intimó a su club por un atraso en el pago de su salario y dinero por derechos de imagen. En este contexto, el aviso del futbolista fue que le daría al club brasileño una semana de plazo para que se regularice la situación. En caso de que el Timao no le pague lo que le corresponda a Rojas, el exLanús, Defensa y Racing se asumirá como jugador libre y podría firmar un nuevo vínculo con cualquier club del mundo, además de exigirle a Corinthians el pago de su contrato, que había sido firmado hasta finales de 2026. Desde que llegó a Corinthians, Rojas disputó 20 partidos en los que aportó dos asistencias y no pudo festejar todavía su primer gol. El paraguayo es uno de los futbolistas mejores pagos del plantel y Corinthians se encuentra en una transición política, con un presidente próximo a asumir en los primeros días de 2024. ¿Le buscarán una salida rápida?

    "title": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that",
    "text": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that Tucked into a hallway at the Republican National Convention, between booths promoting the Second Amendment and another selling official merchandise of the Trump Campaign, sat a sprawling display of the conservative legacy in environmentalism. Young conservatives ran back and forth asking convention goers with Nixon pins if they were familiar with former President Richard Nixon’s environmental policy. They approached oil lobbyists about the need for climate change conversations. They handed out stickers to rising young Republican voters. “The word ‘Conservative’ is in ‘conservation,’” said Aidan Shank, one member of the American Conservation Coalition, the environmental group that set up the booth. For years, the Republican Party has gotten a reputation for denying climate science and the urgency of global warming. Their statements about the environment usually focus on burning more fossil fuels, the biggest driver of climate change. But this year, for the first time in recent memory, conservatives had a climate showing at the Republican National Convention. The leadership of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC) flew to Milwaukee for a week of conversations around climate, conservation, and energy. They kept up efforts to win delegates’ attention and support, even as their party nominated former President Donald Trump, who doesn’t acknowledge the full effects of human-caused climate change and has vowed to rescind many of President Biden’s climate-related investments. Young conservatives are likely to support Trump this November. Still, they want to see their party talk about climate and energy policy. They see potential for a Trump administration to prioritize domestic production of clean energy. Unlike their Democratic counterparts–and prevailing climate science—they also still back oil and gas development. “We can be hopeful. And our approach has always been to work with people where we can,” said Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of ACC. She added: “We really are using this RNC to introduce ourselves to the base, and to stakeholders, and to say there's a better way to do environmental policy.” Young conservatives hope to reframe the conversation On their first morning in Milwaukee, six members of ACC got ready at an Airbnb for their convention debut. Decked out with their American flag caps, brown Tevoca boots, American flag belt and button-up shirt with bison, they planned out their RNC reception event schedule: arrive at 1 pm, do a reception hosted by another group, and have time to visit, talk to dozens of people over five hours. ACC was an RNC sponsor, cementing its mark at the Republican gathering. It's considered a significant milestone for the group, which formed in 2017 during the first Trump administration. At its inception, it quickly attracted young politicos like Stephen Perkins, the 29-year-old chief operating officer of ACC. “I grew up going camping and with my dad and fishing and all that sort of stuff. And so we've always had an appreciation for the environment and the outdoors,” said Perkins, of the Texas places he grew up in and loved. “As I got more involved in politics, the issues that I gravitated toward were the tougher ones.” Perkins likes to talk to fellow young conservatives about the impact of climate change on most policy issues. He recalled when one young Republican told him that he didn’t care about climate — that he was more concerned about immigration. Perkins had an answer for him. “Not the only reason, but a big reason why people are coming here is many of them are climate refugees,” Perkins said of the explanation he gave about immigration “There are places where whether it's flooding or extreme heat, they're coming here to escape that. And so there's actually a connection.” Generally, Republicans have not seen climate as their issue. And leaders, like Trump and Vance, have championed fossil fuel production over conservation and climate action. “He’s (Trump) not perfect. We certainly recognize that. He needs to talk about climate change,” Perkins said. “But when you talk about seven years ago when ACC was started, you couldn't get Republican elected officials to even talk about climate change.” Some of that has evolved. During the first GOP debate, an ACC member asked presidential candidates running against Trump how they would ease fears that the GOP doesn’t care about climate. There were few direct answers. Although climate is not a top issue for Republicans, i [t does rank higher on the list of policy priorities for younger Republican](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/25/1195566969/climate-change-made-it-in-the-gop-debate-some-young-republicans-say-thats-a-win)s. The steps are small but ACC hopes a younger generation of conservatives can reframe the conversation. One way of doing so was with the large booth at the convention. Most visitors were curious and generally supportive. They picked up stickers, and fliers and colored a large poster that spelled out the word “legacy.” There was the occasional pushback — like an oil lobbyist who denied climate change. “Approaching every conversation with empathy is the first place to begin,” said Aidan Shank, who was staffing the ACC table. “There's so many places where we can agree, and just assuming that the conversation revolves around finding those agreements, sometimes that's the most constructive way to create dialogue.” The leaders at ACC wanted to create the organization in order to facilitate the conversations Shank is having at the convention now. Like Perkins, Danielle Butcher Franz grew up in the outdoors. Raised in a more liberal family, she said she never thought of the environment as a partisan issue, until she started talking to others. “As we would speak to our peers, we would notice over and over them saying things like, ‘I'm conservative except on the environment’ or ‘I want to support Democrats because of climate change,’” Butcher Franz said. Though she generally feels welcome in her conservative spaces, she at first had to fight stereotypes. “On the right, you would sort of have this skepticism of, ‘Are you really conservatives, or is this like a Trojan horse for big government solutions that we don't agree with?’ ” Butcher Franz said, noting that she also pushes back against stereotypes about Republican interest in climate. “It can be frustrating to have to constantly feel like you're in myth-busting mode, and you have to constantly dispel these preconceived notions that people have about what you believe and what you stand for,” Butcher Franz said. Republicans celebrate being at the convention — at all Later in the day, the group gathers inside the Mitchell Park Domes Horticulture Conservatory to host a reception with dozens of guests and to talk about energy innovation, and Republicans’ long involvement with the environment. Mainly, they wanted to celebrate being at the convention. Nearly all the speakers acknowledged that this kind of convention presence was new and signals a turning tide. In remarks, ACC President Chris Barnard noted that he believed this was a historic event. “This is the first time something like this has happened at a Republican convention — we have a conservative climate reception,” he proudly told the crowd. Talking with NPR, Barnard says he still feels like there is a stereotype that to care about climate or conservation is to be a Democrat. But he wants to see the GOP — even Trump and Vance — to take advantage of the issue. “It's politically very popular,” Barnard said. “And so the first thing to say really is that for anyone in the Republican Party, that's not championing that message: That's really just a lost opportunity.” Barnard saw speaking to delegates and other 2024 candidates at the convention as a foot in the door. And he hopes ACC’s conversations, the booth and receptions encourage them to address climate in their local races. “It's important to talk to them and kind of equip them with the messaging and how they can talk about these issues,” Barnard said. “And hoping that there's a good opportunity to work with Republicans on important environmental and climate policies.” Copyright 2024 NPR",

The Blood & Guts match that main evented last night’s show saw Perry get handcuffed to the side of the cage, and at one point Mark Briscoe waffled him in the head with a chair. Graves, who retired from the ring due to concussion issues, posted to his Twitter account and wrote: “This is not meant to sound judgmental, or incite ‘us vs. them’ or question anybody’s passion, or talent or intentions. This is just coming from a guy whose career ended from a few too many ACCIDENTAL headshots. The ART of this business is protecting ourselves and each other. Trust me…the gaps in memory are not worth it. I promise.” Graves has since deleted the tweet. Some fans online have defended the spot, arguing that the chair was gimmicked. You can see Graves’ tweet and a clip of the chair shot in the below tweet: In a now deleted tweet, Corey Graves seemingly responded to Jack Perry taking an unprotected chair shot to the head during the [#AEWBloodAndGuts]Match on [#AEWDynamite]on Wednesday.

    "title": "Superviviente de Cáncer de Páncreas da un Gran Salto",
    "text": "Superviviente de Cáncer de Páncreas da un Gran Salto\nEn 2014, Manuel García, de 21 años, decidió dejar de lado el paracaidismo. Saltar desde aviones costaba mucho dinero, y su idea de empezar a practicar [BASE jumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping) (salto desde puentes o acantilados) también tuvo que esperar. Después de 81 saltos, García decidió hacer una pausa hasta poder permitirse comprar su propio equipo.\nCinco años después de hacer una pausa en el deporte, García comenzó a sentir un dolor agudo en el abdomen, náuseas y una pérdida de peso severa. Después de que una ecografía revelara problemas en el hígado, ingresó a un hospital en la zona de Miami, donde le diagnosticaron cáncer en etapa 4.\n“Fue el Viernes Santo,” recuerda. Al principio, no sabían qué tipo de cáncer tenía, pero vieron que se había propagado al hígado. El Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center ofreció un diagnóstico el domingo de Pascua: era cáncer pancreático metastásico en etapa 4.\n“Tenía una masa del tamaño de una pelota de golf y más tumores de los que podían contar en el hígado”, dice. El cáncer también se había extendido a su columna vertebral, y tenía dos pequeños tumores cerebrales. “No hace falta decir que era un desastre. No sabían si debía empezar quimioterapia o cuidados paliativos.”\nEnfrentando la mortalidad\nEn Sylvester, García fue atendido por [Peter Hosein, M.D.](https://medicos.umiamihealth.org/provider/peter-joel-hosein/525839?unified=hosein&sort=relevance&tt=771e3194-1810-449f-9054-87c5a1dc840f&ut=f906b189-7d2f-4f2c-bd6e-d25012667ef4×tamp=2024-11-06T20%3A16%3A01.786Z&from=search-list), director asociado de investigación clínica en el [Sylvester Pancreatic Cancer Research Institute](https://umiamihealth.org/es/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/tratamientos-y-servicios/cancer-de-pancreas) . El cáncer se había propagado demasiado como para que la cirugía fuera una opción, y además había preocupación de que García estuviera demasiado débil para soportar la quimioterapia. “El Dr. Hosein dijo que lo único que podía hacer era darme quimioterapia diluida al 25%”, cuenta García. “Esa era la única oportunidad que nos quedaba”.\nLa quimioterapia diluida empezó a dar resultado. Después de tres meses, García cambió a inmunoterapia. “Estuve en inmunoterapia unos dos años”, dice. “De hecho, ¡tuve mi primera tomografía limpia en la víspera de Año Nuevo, nueve meses después de empezar la inmunoterapia!” Unos meses después, tuvo una recaída. “No fue gran cosa”, dice. “La eliminaron con radiación”.\nMientras recibía tratamiento, García volvió a pensar en su decisión de pausar el paracaidismo. “Tenía 26 años, y me dijeron que estaba muriendo,” afirma.\nRecuerdo haberle explicado a mi mejor amigo Chris: “Sé que no voy a morir; sé que puedo vencer esto”.\n– Manuel García\nEn mayo de 2020, a mitad de su tratamiento contra el cáncer, obtuvo su primer paracaídas. Dos años después, empezó a practicar BASE jumping.\nHoy, a los 31 años, García lleva cinco años libre de cáncer. Trabaja en el negocio de su familia, representando a fabricantes de plomería decorativa de alta gama. Y ha vuelto a lanzarse desde aviones, acantilados y puentes..\nActualmente cuenta con 575 saltos en paracaídas y 50 de BASE jumping.\nEncontrar apoyo\nCuando estuvo enfermo, García encontró un fuerte apoyo entre amigos y familiares.\nTías, tíos, primos… todos los que formaban parte de su vida se unieron para darle fuerza y ayudarlo a mantenerse optimista. “Fue difícil para mis padres”, dice, “a pesar de mi optimismo ingenuo y mi confianza”.\nLas personas que padecen cáncer necesitan el amor y el apoyo de sus amigos, familiares y de la comunidad, afirma García. “Y también tienes que ser tu propio defensor en tu cuidado médico y encontrar el mejor lugar, el mejor doctor que tenga el tratamiento que necesitas.”.\nFuera del trabajo, del paracaidismo y el BASE jumping, García trabaja como voluntario para la[ American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/), la [Seena Magowitz Foundation](https://seenamagowitzfoundation.org/) y el Programa de Adolescentes y Jóvenes Adultos de Sylvester para sobrevivientes de cáncer de entre 15 y 39 años. Y sigue haciendo tiempo para saltar en paracaídas.\n“Mis médicos y mi familia me preguntan a menudo por qué”, comenta. “La razón principal es que es algo que era muy importante para mí y que dejé pendiente. Son mis esperanzas y sueños actuales. La casa, los niños, la familia y la hipoteca parecen estar bien, pero ahora mismo lo que quiero es volar”.\nLouis Greenstein es colaborador del Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.",

    "title": "爆料：美国秘密在芯片货物中安了追踪器-广西新闻网",
    "text": "|\n最近，国家网信办就美国英伟达算力芯片漏洞后门安全风险约谈该公司问题受到关注。与此同时，越来越多美国给芯片安“后门”的内幕也被曝光。 8月13日，路透社又刊发独家报道爆料，美国秘密在人工智能相关芯片中设置追踪器，以发现“芯片被转运至中国的情况”。 报道称，据两位知情人士透露，美国政府已秘密在他们认为有可能被转运至中国的先进芯片目标货物中植入位置追踪装置。知情人士称，这些措施“仅适用于部分受调查的货件”。追踪器可为美方搜集个人或机构违反出口管制的信息。 位置追踪器是美国执法机构数十年来一直使用的一种调查工具，用于追踪受出口限制的产品，例如飞机零部件。 另外五名人工智能服务器供应链相关人士表示，他们知道戴尔和超微 (Super Micro）的服务器货物中使用了这些追踪器，这些服务器中包含英伟达和AMD公司的芯片。这些人表示，追踪器通常隐藏在服务器的产品包装中。 两名参与服务器供应链的人士描述，2024年的一个案例中，一批搭载英伟达芯片的戴尔服务器不仅运输箱上装有大型追踪器，还在包装内甚至服务器内部隐藏了更小、更隐蔽的追踪装置。 消息人士称，负责监督出口管制和执法的美国商务部工业与安全局通常参与这类行动中，另外联邦调查局（FBI）等部门也可能参与其中。 对于美国限制对华出口先进人工智能芯片相关问题，中国外交部发言人林剑11日表示，中方反对将科技和经贸问题政治化、工具化、武器化，反对对中国进行恶意封锁和打压的立场是一贯、明确的。这种做法扰乱全球产供链稳定，不符合任何一方利益。 |\n|\n扫一扫在手机打开当前页\n|\n|",
