    "title": "Mo Bamba receives the cold shoulder from his former teammates in Orlando, because of Cole Anthony | Marca",
    "text": "I t's been almost a year since Mo Bamba left the Orlando Magic . The Philadelphia 76ers center spent the first four and a half years of his NBA career with the Florida team, which he faced on Wednesday night, although with an unexpected obstacle.\nBamba was selected sixth overall by Orlando in the 2018 draft and remained with the team until February 2023, when he left to join the Los Angeles Lakers . The latter released him in the offseason, and that was when he landed in Philadelphia .\nIn the months since his departure from Magic , the 26-year-old had not had the opportunity to face his former teammates until this Wednesday, when the 76ers visited the Kia Center .\nHowever, what was supposed to be a sporting reunion with his old friends turned into a fun situation due to the interference of his former colleague Cole Anthony .\nAnthony's fine In the days before the game, it emerged that Anthony had warned his teammates that anyone who interacted with Bamba during the game would receive a \"personal fine\" from him.\nAlthough the amount or type of fine Anthony would impose on anyone-player or coach-who interacted with his former teammate is unknown, everyone ultimately heeded the threat and took good care not to approach Bamba .\nFortunately, the ban was only in effect for the duration of the match . After the final whistle, everyone was as friendly as ever.\nBamba out of Magic Just on Monday the 25th, Bamba gave one of the best performances of his career. The center came off the bench to contribute 18 points, six rebounds, two assists, and two steals in the Philadelphia 119-113 loss to the Miami Heat .\nAgainst Orlando , the University of Texas graduate was not so lucky since he played 16:18 minutes, went without points, captured seven rebounds, gave one assist, and stole a ball.",

    "text": "Arsenal are through to the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League (UCL), beating holders Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in their quarterfinal match to advance on Wednesday night.\nThe Gunners were too much for Real Madrid, as they secured a 2-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in their second match on Wednesday to reach the semifinals with a 5-1 aggregate win.\nWednesday’s quarterfinal burst into action after a pair of first-half penalty decisions. Bukayo Saka’s penalty was easily saved by Thibaut Courtois, while Madrid’s renewed optimism was dented minutes later after a penalty call of their own was overturned by the referee after a long VAR review.\nArsenal stymied Madrid’s attack in the second half before Saka made amends for his penalty miss with the game’s first goal. But a mistake by William Saliba immediately after led to Vinicius Junior scoring for the reigning European champions.\nGabriel Martinelli scored in injury time to cap off a memorable night for Arsenal and set up a date with Paris Saint-Germain in the team’s first semifinal appearance since 2009.",

    "text": "Sono tornati a casa i due animali che erano fuggiti dalla fattoria di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola e sono stati \"sequestrati\" per due giorni da un vicino. Quest'ultimo non ha voluto raggiungere un accordo con la madre del scientifico cubano, che vive in Svizzera perché il regime di L'Avana le impedisce l'ingresso nell'Isola.\nInvece di concordare con la madre dei Ruiz Urquiola un risarcimento per la rottura della recinzione perimetrale, il vicino, conosciuto come El Niño Dopico, si è rivolto a agenti del DTI e alle autorità del Ministero dell'Agricoltura della provincia, come confermato dallo stesso attivista in due collegamenti in diretta realizzati da CiberCuba per denunciare ciò che stava accadendo in tempo reale.\nGli animali sono rimasti al sole per due giorni, durante i quali la mamma di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola ha temuto il peggio: che venissero sequestrati. E in questo caso la situazione era particolarmente dolorosa perché lei aveva assistito alla nascita di uno dei vitelli sequestrati. Infine, l'impatto mediatico di ciò che stava accadendo in tempo reale ha dato risultati.\nSi presenta la circostanza che lo stesso giorno in cui gli animali furono \"sequestrati\", uno dei lavoratori della finca di cui Ariel Ruiz Urquiola ha l'usufrutto a Viñales (Pinar del Río) si dimise e il cui contratto non ha potuto rinnovare perché non gli è permesso entrare a Cuba per farlo. Questa situazione provocata dal regime stesso è stata utilizzata dalle autorità del Ministero dell'Agricoltura per sostenere che, a causa dell'inadempimento del contratto, la finca deve essere sgomberata e gli animali sequestrati.\nLo scorso dicembre, le autorità del Partito Comunista, sul modello della vecchia Guardia Rurale, sono arrivate nella fattoria e hanno minacciato di portare via tutti gli animali, anche se sono riusciti a sequestrarne solo due.\nIn questa occasione hanno utilizzato un approccio diverso, ma l'obiettivo è lo stesso: portarsi via poco a poco tutti gli animali. La madre di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola è decisa a rimanere a Viñales \"fino all'ultimo bovino\".\nDa parte sua, Ruiz Urquiola ha avviato una protesta pacifica davanti al Bundeshaus, a Berna, per reclamare il rispetto dei diritti della sua famiglia.\nIn un video inviato a CiberCuba, Ariel Ruiz Urquiola esprime gratitudine al pubblico di questa piattaforma per averlo aiutato a recuperare i suoi animali. \"Voglio ringraziarvi per averci aiutato ad amplificare questa ennesima violazione flagrante dei diritti umani di una anziana, in questo caso, di mia madre, e degli animali, che hanno anch'essi diritti, anche se in un paese senza diritti per le persone, quali diritti possono esserci per gli animali?\"\nArchiviato in:",
