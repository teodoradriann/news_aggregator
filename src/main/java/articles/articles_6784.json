    "text": "By Ward Clark | 8:54 PM on June 21, 2024 The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com. \"Man's best friend. (Credit: Unsplash/Christopher Paul High)\nWhen life gives you the chance to do the right thing, you have to be down for the moment. When 38 - yes, you read that right - 38 hound dogs were spotted floundering in the middle of Mississippi's Granada Lake, insurance agent Bob Gist, and his buddy Brad Carlisle, along with their fishing guide Jordan Chrestman, were equal to the task.\nAdvertisement Leaving the fish for the moment, they steered their boat to the water-treading hounds and hauled them to shore, all 38 of them, saving them from a watery grave. Not a single pooch was lost :\nBy the time fishermen spotted the first head bobbing above the water, the 38 dogs were exhausted and struggling to stay alive.\nThe hound dogs had plunged into a large Mississippi lake while chasing a deer, a diversion during a fox hunt. Bob Gist, who was fishing on the lake, knew they had no chance.\n“A deer can swim the Mississippi River, and those dogs are not going to catch a deer in the water,” he recalled Friday.\nThey weren’t going to survive, either, Gist and the others realized — unless someone acted right away. The insurance agent from Jonesboro, Arkansas, along with friend Brad Carlisle and guide Jordan Chrestman, headed over in their small boat.\n“There were dogs everywhere,” Gist said. “They were kind of swimming in circles and didn’t know which direction to go.”\nDeer are indeed good swimmers; it's not unknown for them to take to the water to avoid predatory pursuit. And, to be perfectly candid, most hound trainers I've known go to great lengths to train their dogs not to chase deer. Even the best dogs will break training now and then, though, and in a pack, if one does so, it can cascade through to the others. But once these hounds had followed the deer into the lake, they were in trouble:\nAdvertisement As the dogs’ frantic owners watched from the shore, the three men started grabbing whatever dogs they could. There were too many to all fit on the bass boat, so three trips to shore were needed.\nA photo Gist took during the rescue shows Carlisle standing and grinning in mirrored sunglasses, with more than a half-dozen of the hound dogs perched on the bow. Numbers from the fox hunt are painted on their sides.\n38 dogs were close to drowning on a Mississippi lake. But some fishermen had quite a catch https://t.co/RhIWVPeNVj pic.twitter.com/iqq4zO53pq\n— WHLT 22 Hattiesburg (@WHLT22) June 21, 2024 Kudos all around!",

    "text": "New Year's Eve is already a perilous night for motorists, and winter weather could make the next few days even more difficult for travelers in some parts of the U.S.\nCar crash fatalities jump on New Year's Eve, largely attributed to drunk driving accidents, and although the forecast is mostly clear, poor weather conditions this year could contribute to hazardous road conditions for holiday travelers in some areas.\nMultiple states faced hazardous holiday travel over Christmas when a blustery winter storm brought blizzard conditions to Nebraska and South Dakota. The storm has moved eastward, with 12 states expecting snow over the weekend , including multiple states in the Midwest, northern Alabama and Georgia, and New York and Maine, as well as Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.\nHowever, much of the snow was expected to fall on Friday and Saturday, leaving Sunday through Tuesday mostly clear for travelers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nA highway information sign advises motorists toe dangerous driving conditions in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. A dozen states faced the threat of snow over the weekend, but a NOAA report said weather from December 31 to January 2 would be mostly clear for New Year's travelers. Getty \"The outlook is rosy for most travelers at the start of 2024. A sprawling area of high pressure will keep most of the country dry,\" an NOAA report said Tuesday. \"High temperatures are expected to be near or above average for much of the country through the first half of next week as Arctic air stays bottled up to the north.\"\nHowever, the snow in northern Maine from Saturday may have \"lingering effects\" that \"could impact travel into the New Year,\" NOAA public affairs specialist and meteorologist Erica Grow Cei told Newsweek , although major interstates in the region are unlikely to have any weather-related issues. She added that snow showers enhanced by the lake effect are likely for the Midwest on Sunday, with an inch of snow forecast in the Great Lakes region and 2 to 4 inches predicted in upstate New York and northern Wisconsin.\nThe NOAA report added that precipitation will be scarce, although showers are possible on Monday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern and central Appalachian mountains.\n\"Some snow is possible in higher mountain elevations, but since there's not much cold air in place, the majority of precipitation is likely to fall as rain. Looking ahead to Tuesday, the outlook is dry for most folks traveling east of the Rockies,\" the report said.\nRead more Chart shows how California reservoir changed after winter storms First-ever December flood warning issued for Red River of the North Wind storm sparks warning for people to stay away from windows Rain showers are expected along the West Coast on Monday, with a threat of snow in the Cascades and the northern Sierras.\n\"However, the impact on travel should be low, as the snow is likely confined to elevations above the mountain passes and major interstates,\" NOAA reported.\nMeanwhile, air travel could be interrupted by a low ceiling on Monday and Tuesday in and out of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\"January 2nd could also be gusty at airport hubs along the East Coast, including Atlanta, Washington DC, and New York City,\" the report said.\nMore motorists are impacted by winter weather in the days leading up to the new year, with the National Weather Service issuing weather advisories for five states on Friday. Parts of Alaska, California, Maine, Nevada and Tennessee will be impacted by high wind, as well as snow and freezing rain that could reduce visibility in the early part of the weekend.\nUncommon Knowledge Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines About the writer Anna Skinner\nFOLLOW Anna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.
