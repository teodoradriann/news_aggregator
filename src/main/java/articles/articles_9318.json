While the storm isn’t as powerful, there are low chances that it will reach as far as Central Florida.\nTypical viewing for geomagnetic storm conditions What are the Northern Lights?\nThe Northern Lights, referred to as the Aurora Borealis, is a natural light show that occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with the gases of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, giving the sky a dance show with either green, blue, pink, red, or violet in it.\nThe best time to see the Northern Lights is between August and April, with October and November being the Peak times.

    "title": "Federal health minister accuses Alberta premier of putting politics over patients in dental-care debate | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Two days after Alberta informed Ottawa the province intends to \"opt out\" of a national dental-care program, the federal health minister says Danielle Smith is \"trying to seek conflict\" instead of focusing on patients. Smith argues the federal government should work to expand Alberta's existing dental program instead of creating a \"duplicate plan.\" \"If it's about patients and it's about care and (Alberta) thinks they can do better, great. But here's the news: they weren't covering these people. If it's their jurisdiction, then with all due respect, you weren't doing your job,\" federal Health Minister Mark Holland said Thursday morning. \"It seems the way that Premier Smith put it was more about trying to seek conflict with us to create some kind of political thing than it was about patients.\" In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday, Smith wrote there was a lack of consultation with provinces in crafting the Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) and that it should instead work in conjunction with Alberta's current dental programs. \"As such, Alberta intends to opt out of the federal plan and maintain its provincial programs for Albertans. Alberta is seeking to negotiate an agreement for the province's share of federal dental funding and will use this unconditional funding to expand dental coverage to more low-income Albertans,\" Smith wrote. Two days after Alberta informed Ottawa the province intends to \"opt out\" of a national dental-care program, the federal health minister says Danielle Smith is \"trying to seek conflict\" instead of focusing on patients. The CDCP is funded and managed by the federal government, not the province, so it's unclear what Smith means by her intention to \"opt out,\" or what she's willing to do if the federal government continues administering the plan in Alberta beyond 2026. \"I suppose they could just say they want to operate a duplicate plan,\" Smith told CTV News on Thursday. \"But what we would prefer to see is for them to co-ordinate with our plans so that they would opt into what we're doing. I think it would make it a lot easier for dentists, who make it easier for clients,\" she said. The federal plan is estimated to cost $13 billion over five years and there's no indication how much of that could be allocated to Alberta. The national program started providing coverage for seniors in May and on Thursday was expanded to include all children under the age of 18 and adults with disabilities. \"It's not too late. I would hope that over the next couple of years, we would be able to have (the federal government) give us the dollars so that we can dedicate it to expanding our program,\" Smith said. The Alberta Dental Association (ADA) says it has concerns with the province's decision to pull out of the national program. The decision, the ADA says, \"makes an already complex situation even more confusing for both patients and dentists.\" \"While our Association has met with the Province about existing low-income dental programs and the possibility of an Alberta-based program, our focus is on supporting Alberta's dentists and the oral health of all Albertans.\" Calgary Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories TREND LINE Trudeau Liberals 'under siege' across the country, with Conservatives cracking red 'fortresses' like Toronto and Vancouver: Nanos Hot on the heels of the Conservatives’ stunning byelection victory in the riding of Toronto—St. Paul’s, new seat projection data from Nanos Research show ridings considered previously safe for the Liberals are increasingly up for grabs.

    "title": "Family tracked stolen luggage to thief’s house using Apple AirTag",
    "text": "This holiday season, thousands waited with bated breath at baggage carousels in airports around the world waiting to see if their luggage would come around, hoping their long travel day would not end in a conversation with an airline agent and a trip to the store. The Gavino family of South Carolina was no exception. The weekend before Christmas, the family was on their way to enjoy the North Carolina mountains when one of their bags never arrived at their destination, they told Queen City News . But thanks to some handy technology and a bit of patience, they were soon reunited with their bag — and they didn’t even have to wait on hold with their airline’s customer service. Charlotte Gavino told the outlet she happened to buy Apple AirTags — which are small trackers that can be attached to personal items and tracked on an Apple device — just one day before her family set out for their holiday vacation. Ms Gavino told the outlet she placed one in her parents’ luggage the morning of their flight, thinking it would be handy if the blog got lost. When their bag never arrived on the baggage carousel on 22 December, she tracked the AirTag and discovered it was on its way to a nearby residential area. “Throughout the entire trip it kept showing up around Gastonia, and South Carolina,” Ms Gavino told Queen City News. That afternoon, the family pursued the AirTag, but it eventually stopped showing an exact location, she told the outlet. But on Christmas day, an address appeared — and the family made their way there. Ms Gavino called the police, who found their luggage inside the home. Many items were missing, Queen City News reported. The AirTag not only saved the Gavino family’s luggage but also another suitcase found in the home that belonged to a second victim. The suspect now faces multiple charges, including theft and drug possession, according to Queen City News. “I wanted justice,” said Ms Gavino.",
