    "text": "Helle Thorning-Schmidt has expressed concern over Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement. January 9, 2025: A member of Meta’s oversight board is “very concerned” about the company’s decision to ditch fact-checkers. Zuckerberg’s Shift to “Free Expression” Sparks Criticism Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg recently announced a series of changes designed to get the company “back to our roots around free expression” – but Helle Thorning-Schmidt has already voiced her concerns about the move. She told BBC Radio 4’s ‘Today’ show: “We are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully.”\nTech journalist Kara Swisher has also hit out at the changes, describing it as a “cynical” ploy by Zuckerberg and Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp.\nShe told the BBC: “Facebook does whatever is in its self-interest.”\nZuckerberg recently announced plans to scrap independent fact-checkers on Facebook and Instagram, explaining that the current approach is “too politically biased”.\nThe billionaire businessman said in a statement: “We’re going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the US…\n“The fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created – especially in the US.\n“Over the next couple of months, we’re going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.”\nZuckerberg intends to work more closely with the US government in a bid to protect freedom of expression.\nHe explained: “The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world.\n“Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalising censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there.\n“Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down.\n“China has censored our apps from even working in the country.\n“The only way we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US Government.”\nWhat are the biggest stories trending online today?

    "text": "13:59 News Story GOP lawmakers grill former justice on Maricopa County ballot printer problems Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy | Arizona Mirror Two Republican state lawmakers questioned former Arizona Supreme Court Justice Ruth McGregor on Thursday about an [independent investigation](https://www.maricopa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2690) she did into Maricopa County’s ballot printer issues during the 2022 general election. McGregor’s report, released earlier this year, determined that the Oki printers the county used malfunctioned because the ballots were larger and printed on heavier paper than in past elections. The investigation was prompted by an Election Day that was marred by long delays after the printer errors meant thousands of ballots couldn’t be read by polling location ballot tabulators. Although all of the ballots affected were ultimately counted by different machines at the county’s election headquarters, the printer malfunction and resulting chaos on Election Day created a new swath of conspiracy theories around Maricopa County’s handling of elections. [ ](/subscribe) GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX McGregor, who was hired by the county to lead the investigation, gave the House Ad Hoc Committee on Oversight, Accountability and Big Tech a lengthy rundown on how her team conducted its work and their key findings. The committee is chaired by Rep. Alexander Kolodin, R-Scottsdale, a lawyer known for bringing cases alleging election fraud and defending those who [spread baseless conspiracy theories](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/oath-keepers-watched-maricopa-county-drop-boxes-despite-claims-to-the-contrary/). Kolodin [has been sanctioned](https://www.azmirror.com/2023/12/14/gop-lawmaker-alexander-kolodin-sanctioned-for-2020-kraken-lawsuit-other-election-cases/) for several of those cases. [GOP lawmaker Alexander Kolodin sanctioned for 2020 ‘kraken’ lawsuit, other election cases] “They were not what I would call pervasive,” McGregor said about the printer issue discovered by her and her team. Her report indicated that the Oki printers were not able to maintain the heat needed to print ballots correctly, which caused affected ballots to be rejected by the on-site tabulators. The long length of the ballot, coupled with heavier paper, created an issue where errors such as “white splotches” would appear on the timing marks and other parts of the ballot. The result was that the on-site tabulators rejected affected ballots. Voters whose ballots couldn’t be read instead deposited them in a secure box that was transferred to central tabulation, where they were tabulated by different machines. In some cases, the ballots were recreated by bipartisan teams and then counted. “This was a problem that I am confident that they had not anticipated,” McGregor told the committee. The ballot printing issue arose, in part, because of unfounded concerns around the 2020 election in Maricopa County, when some voters [wrongly believed that Sharpie markers were invalidating their votes](https://www.azmirror.com/2020/11/04/no-truth-to-gop-claims-that-sharpies-are-invalidating-arizona-ballots/) because the ink bled through the thinner paper. Kolodin brought a lawsuit against the county due to the beliefs of what has been colloquially termed “ [Sharpiegate](https://www.azmirror.com/2020/11/04/no-truth-to-gop-claims-that-sharpies-are-invalidating-arizona-ballots/),” and it was one of the cases for which he was sanctioned. The county moved to thicker paper in 2022 in an attempt to quell those concerns. Additionally, the usual 19-inch ballot became a 20-inch ballot in order for the numerous races and ballot propositions to be able to fit and still be the statutorily required text size. Maricopa County has over 12,000 ballot styles alone. Kolodin and Rep. Neal Carter, R-San Tan Valley, voiced their displeasure with how Maricopa County elections were run, claiming the process was not transparent. On several occasions, McGregor said the questions they were asking her should be directed instead to county election officials. “We agree we would like to ask Maricopa County these questions,” Kolodin said to McGregor, later adding that county officials were invited to attend the meeting but denied to do so, citing “on-going legal action.” “What assurance do we have that they’ll get it right this time?” Kolodin asked of McGregor, who reiterated that she was hired to do the investigation and is not privy to what actions the county might take. “I think they undertook a good faith effort to try to avoid this problem in the future,” McGregor said. “I think that they have tried to fix the issues that arose. I’m a voter, too, and would like our elections to go perfectly.” McGregor suggested that Maricopa County should adopt more rigorous testing that more closely replicates Election Day conditions, as her investigation revealed that the intermittent use of the printers contributed to the problem. The county currently tests the printers by printing off a large number of ballots all at once, but McGregor’s testing found doing so did not accurately replicate the issue faced on Election Day. McGregor told the committee that she has “no opinion” on possible actions the legislature could take to remedy the printer issues, but reiterated that all of the affected ballots — an estimated 6% of those cast on Election Day — were counted. Kolodin contended that voters who left polling places due to the long lines created by the printer problems were disenfranchised, which McGregor [pointed out had happened before](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/23/maricopa-county-recorder-helen-purcell-admits-fault-long-primary-lines/82165730/) in 2016. “Nobody lost a vote because of a printer error,” McGregor reiterated, telling the committee that the best thing they could do is help educate the public and alleviate fears. “I think that, rather than distress our voters, we should do something to reassure them that the elections are done with a great deal of care and the workers try very hard to make sure their votes are counted.” Kolodin appeared to disagree with McGregor’s sentiments. “It is pretty hard to reassure those people,” Kolodin said of voters who experienced issues. The former Arizona Supreme Court justice shot back, saying that “misinformation” spread on Election Day likely hurt voter confidence more than the printer problems. GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake [spread false information](https://x.com/KariLake/status/1590019165611782144?s=20) to voters on Election Day and encouraged non-disabled voters to use the [machines for voters with disabilities](https://x.com/KariLake/status/1590019167666962432?s=20). “In my mind, the best way to reassure somebody is to actually just fix the problem,” Kolodin said, claiming that the county was not on the right track. McGregor interjected that the county “could be” on the right track, prompting Kolodin to say that “we don’t know” if that’s the case. Carter used his time at the end of the committee to take a swipe at Democratic members who he said are ignoring issues with the election process. “What I’m observing is that there is a significant portion of the voters who lack confidence in their elections,” Carter claimed. There has been no evidence found to promote the theory that malfeasance or wide spread fraud occurred in the 2020 or 2022 general elections. Many lawsuits have been filed making such claims, but all of them have been rejected because they lack any evidence of wrongdoing. [ ](/donate) SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

    "text": "María José Gómez hace 30 minutos Tiempo de lectura: 3 minutos Con el auge de esta tecnología en diversos recintos, los ciberdelincuentes han desarrollado un nuevo tipo de ataque que usa los códigos QR para robar información.\ncompartir Comentarios El escaneo de los códigos QR ha experimentado una notable popularidad en los últimos años.\nSe trata de un método que puede almacenar determinado tipo de información, como URL de sitios web, y que adquirió fama desde la pandemia por Covid-19 con el fin de evitar las interacciones físicas con objetos o personas.\nNi WhatsApp ni Instagram: estas son las apps más descargadas por la Generación Z en 2024 ¿Quién se queda con el éxodo de X? Tiene una amplia gama de usos, como consultar el menú de un restaurante, cancelar una cuenta, identificar un paquete que será enviado y hasta pagar el transporte público.\nEl problema está en que, como ha ocurrido con otras tecnologías , los códigos QR están asociados a varios riesgos.\nA propósito del auge que tienen en la actualidad, ha surgido un nuevo tipo de estafa que usa esta herramienta para cometer fraude. Se trata del quishing .\nQué es el quishing Los códigos QR son representaciones de datos que pueden escanearse con la cámara de los smartphones. Una vez que el lector descifra el código, usualmente este almacena un enlace, aunque también pueden ser otro tipo de contenidos como textos e imágenes.\nGran parte de su popularidad se debe a que son sencillos y eficientes de usar para obtener información.\nEl quishing, también conocido como qrishing, precisamente aprovecha esa ventaja que tiene la tecnología: es una modalidad de ciberataque que con códigos QR fraudulentos pretende engañar a los usuarios, dirigirlos a sitios web maliciosos y robar datos sensibles.\nLa historia continua más abajo\nMás sobre Tecnología Chile se ubica 160 entre 180 países por la calidad de su aire según estudio de la U. de Yale Hace 23 horas La pregunta del millón: ¿cambiarse al iPhone 16? Hace 24 horas Se trata también de un tipo de phishing -de ahí viene su nombre-, que es una estrategia en que los ciberdelincuentes usan correos electrónicos o llamadas para suplantar a personas de confianza y así atacar al usuario.\nLos códigos QR elevaron su popularidad desde la pandemia. Foto referencial. Cómo funciona el quishing Este tipo de ciberataque usualmente se basa en que el usuario ve un código QR aparentemente inofensivo y decide escanearlo con su dispositivo, con la misma facilidad que si fuera uno auténtico . Luego aparece la opción de consultar una URL y dirige a una página maliciosa, sin que el usuario pueda identificar que no es segura. La página luego busca robar información confidencial, como datos bancarios, credenciales para iniciar sesión, así como instalar un software malicioso (malware).\nScott Ruoti, profesor de Ciencias de la Computación de la Universidad de Tennessee (Estados Unidos), detalló a la BBC que otro método que podría ocurrir con los códigos QR fraudulentos es que, después de escanearlos, la URL conduzca a un sitio auténtico y la tecnología lo engañe con el fin de que haga una acción dañina al usuario.\nLos códigos QR engañosos podrían estar presentes en lugares públicos, especialmente donde los usuarios pretenden consultar un menú, acceder a una red de Wi-Fi pública o ver una oferta publicitaria.\nDesde Infobae recalcan que en verano tiende a ser la época donde más se dan ataques de este tipo, debido a que durante las vacaciones, las personas tienen la necesidad constante de usar esta tecnología para consumir en restoranes y suelen despreocuparse un poco más.\nEste es el proyecto de ley que busca individualizar a usuarios de celulares prepago. Cómo evitar las estafas con códigos QR Reconocer códigos QR que tienen fines maliciosos podría ser una tarea compleja, considerando que lucen idénticos a los legítimos.\nSin embargo, hay algunas estrategias que se pueden realizar para brindar más protección ante este tipo de ciberataque.\nDesconfía de los códigos QR de procedencia desconocida y que lleguen de forma inesperada. Si te encuentras con uno en la vía pública, lo has recibido en tu correo o en un mensaje sin haberlo pedido, evita escanearlos para mantener tu seguridad. Si realizas pagos o transacciones con códigos QR, verifica que la acción ha resultado bien tanto para el comprador como el vendedor. Si el código QR está impreso en una tienda, restorán u otros comercios, intenta constatar de que no fue manipulado o tenga un adhesivo pegado sobre el código real. En el caso de que observes irregularidades, avisa a los responsables de los recintos. Algunas aplicaciones enfocadas en el escaneo de códigos QR permiten tener una vista previa de una URL. Esto puede ser útil para comprobar la seguridad del enlace y no caer en el quishing. Mantener actualizado el software de tu dispositivo puede ser otra medida de utilidad para protegerte de un ciberataque.

    "title": "El Papa Francisco ya planea su muerte: este es el lugar dónde quiere ser sepultado",
    "text": "El Papa Francisco ya planea su muerte: este es el lugar dónde quiere ser sepultado\nLa salud de Jorge Mario Bergoglio continúa en estado delicado, por lo que han comenzado surgir adelantos sobre su posible deceso\nEl pasado miércoles 19 de febrero el Vaticano informó que el papa Francisco sigue en una situación clínica “compleja” debido a la neumonía bilateral que padece. Hoy por la mañana, en una conferencia de prensa el médico del pontífice, Sergio Alfieri, actualizó la información sobre el caso y dejó claro que el Santo Padre aún no está “fuera de peligro”.\nEn ese contexto es donde surgen teorías acerca de cuáles son los protocolos que tendrían que seguir en caso de que el Papa falleciera y, más allá del cónclave que tendría que suceder para definir quién quedaría al frente de la Iglesia, ha llamado la atención el deseo del pontífice de ser enterrado en la basílica romana de Santa María la Mayor, en Roma, Italia.\nAsí lo ha expresado el propio Papa Francisco, quien desea ir en contra de la tradición, la cual dicta que todos los líderes de la Iglesia católica deben ser enterrados en las grutas del Vaticano.\nJorge Mario Bergoglio ha llegado a expresar en entrevistas que su petición de ser enterrado en la basílica romana de Santa María la Mayor se basa en su deseo de querer estar cerca de su ícono favorito de la Virgen.\nEl Papa Francisco, de 88 años, también expresó el año pasado que no pensaba en dimitir a pesar de una serie de problemas de salud.\n¿Cómo es la Basílica Romana de Santa María la Mayor, donde quiere ser enterrado el Papa Francisco?\nTal y cómo lo describe el Vaticano, la Basílica Papal de Santa María la Mayor domina la ciudad de Roma desde hace dieciséis siglos: el templo mariano por excelencia y cuna de la civilización artística. Situada en la cima del monte Esquilino, es una de las cuatro basílicas papales de Roma.\nSegún la tradición, la Virgen indicó e inspiró la construcción de su casa en el Esquilino. Apareciéndose en sueños al patricio Juan y al Papa Liberio, pidió la construcción de una iglesia en su honor, en un lugar que indicaría milagrosamente.\nLa Basílica alberga el icono mariano más importante, la Salus Populi Romani. La tradición atribuye la imagen a San Lucas, evangelista y patrón de los pintores. El Papa Francisco pone sus viajes apostólicos bajo la protección de la Salus, a quien suele visitar antes de su partida y después de su regreso.\nEl papa Francisco I no sería el primero en ser enterrado en este lugar, pues en la Basílica están enterrados siete Papas.\n¿Qué se sabe sobre la salud del Papa Francisco?\nEl pasado 20 de febrero, la Oficina de Prensa de la Santa Sede informó que la salud del Papa está “ligeramente mejor”. Asimismo aseguró que el pontífice “se encuentra afebril y los parámetros hemodinámicos continúan estables”.\n“Las condiciones clínicas del Santo Padre presentan una leve mejoría. Se encuentra afebril y sus parámetros hemodinámicos continúan estables. Esta mañana ha recibido la Eucaristía y, posteriormente, se ha dedicado a sus actividades laborales”, informó el Vaticano en un comunicado.\nRecordemos que el Papa se encuentra internado en el hospital Gemelli de Roma, desde el 14 de febrero, donde fue diagnosticado con un brote de neumonía bilateral. Se informa que el máximo representante de la Iglesia sigue respirando de forma independiente y su corazón “se mantiene bien”.\nTomando en cuenta las actualizaciones dadas por la Santa Sede, también es preciso recalcar que la situación clínica del Papa Francisco sigue siendo “compleja”.\nLa Oficina de Prensa de la Santa Sede informó el miércoles por la tarde que “los análisis de sangre, evaluados por el personal médico, muestran una ligera mejoría, en particular de los índices inflamatorios”.\nLa misma fuente señaló que después del desayuno, el Papa leyó algunos periódicos y luego realizó su trabajo con sus colaboradores más cercanos y que antes del almuerzo recibió la Eucaristía.\nPor la tarde del miércoles, el Papa Francisco recibió la visita de la primera ministra italiana, Giorgia Meloni, con quien pasó 20 minutos en privado, asegura Vaticano News.",

    "text": "“— Silvia Vásquez-Lavado , la primera mujer peruana en llegar a la cumbre del Everest… Oírlo en voz alta me llena el corazón de orgullo. Tengo la oportunidad de reescribir este legado de dolor . De mostrarle a las niñas y mujeres de todo el mundo que es posible. Quiero decirles que los hombres más fuertes de mi equipo fueron los primeros en irse . Y que yo sigo aquí. Y voy a llegar hasta la cumbre, aunque me mate”. Pero, la muerte no la alcanzó, aunque en el ascenso pase rozando entre el congelamiento, las tormentas, la fatiga, la falta de oxígeno, el blanco de la nieve y las cuerdas que sostienen, y se cruce repetidamente por la cabeza de todos los que intentan la hazaña. También por la de Silvia Vasquez-Lavado: “Un hielo interminable que cae a mi alrededor a una velocidad vertiginosa. Imagino que soy la siguiente en caer. Nadie me oiría ni me vería. Simplemente estaría aquí y un segundo después me habría ido ”.\nNacida en Lima, en su libro autobiográfico El abrazo de la montaña , Vásquez-Lavado relata el pedregoso camino hacia lo más alto , que la llevó no solo a marcar un hito para su país, sino también para la comunidad LGTBI, al ser la primera mujer abiertamente lesbiana en alcanzar las siete cumbres más altas del mundo.\nFue el deseo de sanar lo que la llevó hacerse montañista. Siendo niña fue víctima de abuso sexual en manos de J, el hombre que se encargaba de las tareas domésticas y de cuidarla en casa durante las ausencias de su madre.\nEl trauma, el largo silencio y la vergüenza la hicieron emigrar, estudiar fuera y desarrollar una brillante carrera en Silicon Valley, pero la herida de fondo siguió abierta y durante años tuvo que lidiar con el alcoholismo, la adicción al trabajo y al sexo.\nEn 2017, un año después de alcanzar el Everest, tuvo un accidente en bicicleta tras el que le detectaron un tumor cerebral . Antes de que le confirmaran que era benigno, tomó la decisión de dejar su trabajo corporativo en San Francisco y dedicarse compartir su historia. Tres años antes había creado la Fundación Courageous Girls , para llevar a niñas y jóvenes, víctimas de tráfico y abuso sexual a sanarse en la montaña.\nHoy trabaja para hacer de su libro una película con Selena Gómez y planea usar inteligencia artificial para “revolucionar la educación” partiendo por un pueblito del Amazonas peruano. “¿Qué es lo único que le impide a esas jóvenes convertirse en las Gretas (Thunberg) del mundo?, la educación que no tienen”.\nBBC Mundo habló con ella en el marco del Hay el Festival Querétaro, que tiene lugar entre el 5 y 8 de septiembre en esa ciudad mexicana.\n—La noche antes de partir al Everest, tratás de dormir en la cómoda cama de un hotel, pero te es muy difícil, ¿qué tenías en la cabeza?\n— Era un momento de gran incertidumbre, no sabía lo que iba a pasar, por ahí me salía el tiro por la culata me estaba aferrando a demasiadas cosas, no solamente a cumplir el sueño imposible de alcanzar la cumbre, sino también el llevar por primera vez a un grupo de jóvenes víctimas de violencia sexual hasta el campamento base. Tenía el corazón abierto y estaba muy vulnerable . Reflexionaba que lo que me había llevado allí era el espejo del dolor que sufría a diario. Las camas siempre me provocaban algo, porque el abuso pasó en una cama y también otras cosas de las que no sentía orgullo en periodos de mi vida que fueron muy difíciles.\nSilvia Vásquez-Lavado se convirtió en la primera mujer peruana en llegar a la cumbre del Everest Silvia Vásquez-Lavado",
