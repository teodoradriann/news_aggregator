    "title": "Walz Lied About Drunk Driving, Says ... CNN – HotAir",
    "text": "Hot Air readers knew about this nine days ago . Minnesotans knew about it two years ago, at least, and voters in Minnesota's first congressional district knew about it eighteen years ago .\nAdvertisement The question now is: why didn't Kamala Harris and her team know about it? CNN's Andrew Kaczynski just made that awkward question relevant by reporting not just on Tim Walz' 1995 DUI arrest in Nebraska, but the fact that Walz has consistently lied about it:\nAccording to court and police records connected to the incident, Walz admitted in court that he had been drinking when he was pulled over for driving 96 mph in a 55 mph zone in Nebraska. Walz was then transported by a state trooper to a local hospital for a blood test, showing he had a blood alcohol level of .128, well above the state’s legal limit of 0.1 at the time .\nBut in 2006, his campaign repeatedly told the press that he had not been drinking that night, claiming that his failed field sobriety test was due to a misunderstanding related to hearing loss from his time in the National Guard. The campaign also claimed that Walz was allowed to drive himself to jail that night.\nNone of that was true.\nNot at all, as Alpha News' Anthony Gockowski reported in 2022 during the gubernatorial campaign. The Walz campaign tried passing it off as related to alleged \"deafness\" in 2006, and Walz has never corrected the record since. The state trooper pulled Walz over for speeding and smelled \" a strong odor of alcoholic beverage \" from Walz. That led to the field sobriety test and the subsequent blood draw at a hospital.\nAdvertisement Put simply, Walz BS'd his way out of the issue in 2006:\nIn one of the few available articles on the incident, Walz’s campaign manager told the Rochester Post Bulletin he was “not drunk” and “attributed the misunderstanding to Walz’s deafness,” an issue Walz said was caused by his time in the National Guard that has since been “surgically corrected.”\n“He couldn’t understand what the officer was saying to him,” Walz’s campaign manager said at the time, noting his deafness caused “balance issues.” Neither the trooper’s report nor the court transcript reference the governor’s hearing issues.\nThe results of the blood test were later suppressed, seemingly as a result of the trooper’s failure to realize Walz was deaf, according to the Post Bulletin article. This means the results wouldn’t have been used as evidence against Walz had the case gone to trial, but they were still referenced during a March 13, 1996 hearing on the plea agreement.\nDuring that hearing, former Dawes County Attorney Rex Nowlan said that Walz had a blood alcohol concentration of .128 at the time of the incident.\nKaczynski credits and links Alpha News while noting that Walz ended up taking a plea deal. That forced Walz to allocute to the crime, including drunk driving, which Walz' attorney spun in the hearing as an educational opportunity:\nAdvertisement Walz took a plea deal, court records show, pleading guilty to reckless driving. In a court hearing in March 1996, Walz admitted that he had been drinking and driving.\nHis lawyer said Walz intended to use the incident as a way to educate his students on the perils of drinking and driving.\n“It’s just a dangerous situation,” Walz said in a court transcript, which Alpha News, a conservative Minnesota outlet uncovered in 2022. “Not just to myself, but to others who aren’t even involved with it.”\nWalz' representation of this incident did eventually evolve, so to speak, likely because the stakes got higher in his political career:\nAs Walz’s political career progressed, so did his explanation for his 1995 arrest.\nIn 2018, when running for governor, Walz offered a markedly different version of events.\nAccording to Walz, the arrest was a life-changing moment, motivating him to change his behavior. He said he has since given up alcohol and his go-to drink is now Diet Mountain Dew.\nSo he left a lie on the record for 12 years while running and winning House races in MN-01. Only when the risk of more enthusiastic oppo research emerged in his first gubernatorial race did Walz 'fess up to his DUI. That doesn't make him a hero; it makes Walz an opportunist willing to say anything to get elected. In that sense, he's teamed up with a fitting running mate .\nAdvertisement Just how much of this did Walz disclose to Kamala Harris before she selected him as a running mate? Did Eric Holder even turn it up in the vetting process? If he did, why would she choose a running mate who's lied about a DUI for political purposes over an alternative? Perhaps one in Pennsylvania or Michigan, states Democrats really have to win to recapture the White House?\nPerhaps we'll get an answer to that question, if CNN and other media outlets demand one. CNN at least is covering the question now.",

    "title": "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Movie Review: The Juice Is Loose In This Frenetic But Underwhelming Sequel [Venice 2024]",
    "text": "Who hasn't been dying for this decomposing little scamp to worm his way back into the land of the living? In \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" the long-awaited sequel to \"Beetlejuice,\" the Deetz family returns — now with a whole bunch more emotional baggage and the next generation in tow, played by a scowling Jenna Ortega. \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" succeeds in giving the newest Deetz a compelling story of her own that isn't just a rehash of Lydia's from \"Beetlejuice,\" and delivering some fantastic Afterlife world-building that expands dramatically upon the original. But strangely, the franchise's two most popular characters — Lydia (Winona Ryder) and Beetlejuice himself (Michael Keaton) — are given much less to work with. Their lack of interesting characterization may not sink the film, but it mutes the emotional impact of having the original gang back together. \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" takes place around 30 years after the events of the original film, our bright-eyed gothic queen Lydia now a celebrity psychic who uses her ability to communicate with the undead to launch a lucrative career as a medium. When her father Charles dies suddenly (he was played by the problematic Jeffrey Jones in the original film, but \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" goes to ridiculous and often hilarious lengths to avoid needing to recast him), she and her stepmother Delia (an always delightful Catherine O'Hara) return to their iconic home in Winter River to get his affairs in order. Lydia's teenage daughter Astrid (Jenna Ortega) reluctantly tags along, their relationship hanging by the barest of threads. But little do they know that on the other side of the veil, Beetlejuice has some problems of his own — namely, a murderous ex-wife (Monica Bellucci) and his lingering obsession with Lydia, both of which come to a head in fairly short order. Jenna Ortega shines, while Lydia and Beetlejuice are poorly utilized As Astrid, Jenna Ortega gets perhaps the most interesting character arc of the film, as she grieves the loss of her father and grapples with a fractured relationship with her mother, who she considers a fraud. She's not a carbon copy of Lydia — although we can certainly see the personality resemblance between the two — and her main narrative complements the world of \"Beetlejuice\" and the original film without trying to replicate it. Were Lydia a less popular character, it would be easy to see this being primarily Astrid's story, focusing more on her own grief and burgeoning relationship with Jeremy (Arthur Conti) alongside some Beetlejuice-tinged adventures. But here, the film's creators are in a bind — how can they do right by Lydia and Beetlejuice while still injecting vitality in the form of a new, youthful character who could eventually become one of the faces of the franchise moving forward? Honestly, they don't do a great job. When we meet Lydia, now middle-aged and having sold out for a career that takes a toll on her mental health and makes a mockery of her paranormal abilities, she's a sad, broken woman. It's hard to understand why the writers thought we would want to see this version of Lydia, but it's kind of a bummer. Similarly, Beetlejuice is a bit of a letdown. Given that his name is the title of the original film and he's become such a memorable character, audiences sometimes forget that he's really not in that much of \"Beetlejuice\" compared to Lydia and the Maitlands. In the sequel, we get a lot more of him, but it's somehow much less meaningful — he almost works better as a looming off-screen presence with brief, periodic appearances. Here, we maybe see too much of him. And so much of his screen time is devoted to the bizarre backstory of his ex-wife, the death cult leader, a subplot that goes absolutely nowhere. We kind of don't need any of it? Less is more, especially with an over-the-top chaos agent like Beetlejuice. There's a moment in the film where Lydia finally desperately summons him and he emerges triumphantly from the model town, which feels like it would have been a much more effective re-introduction of the character. Better than watching him work a middle-management job in the Afterlife, at least (no disrespect to Bob, of course, his Goomba-like underling who we would both kill and die for). Honoring the original while also creating something new Ultimately, it's the writing that prevents \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" from living up to the eccentric charms of the original film. There are too many loose ends, too many subplots that aren't resolved to any degree of satisfaction and probably don't need to exist in the first place. You can feel a silent war going on that strangely echoes some of the themes of the film, which reflect a common struggle for long-awaited sequels — how much do you attempt to pay homage to the characters who helped put the original \"Beetlejuice\" on the map, and when do you decide instead to forge ahead? \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" splits the difference, and winds up neglecting both. Still, there's enough here to win over audiences who loved the original film, particularly in its depiction of the endless bureaucracy of the Afterlife, so it's not out of the question that a potential future \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" might get the chance to get the balance right next time. \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" hits theaters on September 6.",

    "text": "唤醒“老物件”的“新生机” 分享到： → 分享到： 唤醒“老物件”的“新生机” 2025-07-24 10:54:22 来源： 《中国新闻》报 作者：刘欢 责任编辑：刘欢 2025年07月24日 10:54　来源：《中国新闻》报 大字体 小字体 分享到： 北京燕京八绝博物馆依照馆藏文物“京绣龙袍”设计的冰箱贴。(《中国新闻》报 任德辉 摄) 　　龙袍，中国古代皇帝的服装，上面的一片龙鳞、一朵祥云都融入了繁复的针线技法。今年，北京燕京八绝博物馆的匠人仿照馆中所藏“京绣龙袍”，还原出五爪龙、海水江崖等纹饰要素，设计了一枚等比例缩小的冰箱贴，让游客得以将“龙袍”拿在手心，带回家中。\n　　7月20日，这款“京绣龙袍”新品文创亮相民建第七届北京西山永定河发展研讨会。其间，北京燕京八绝博物馆还首次展出了“百宝嵌绢花百福图”。这幅作品集金漆镶嵌髹饰技艺、北京绢花两种国家级非物质文化遗产于一身，刻画出56种花果，构成了一个五彩斑斓的“福”字，引来参会者驻足品鉴。\n　　这幅作品由民建北京市委会文化委副主任、北京燕京八绝博物馆馆长柏群与工艺美术大师高云共同创作。当天，柏群在会上表示：“博物馆不仅要满足大众参观需求，更要做非遗技艺传承创新的展示平台，助力中华老字号重新打响品牌，融入文化产业发展浪潮。”\n　　据悉，2025第七届北京西山永定河发展研讨会是民建石景山区工委连续举办多年的“北京西山永定河发展论坛”的延续。石景山所在的京西地区有着钢铁与煤矿赋予的工业记忆，如今首钢迁址、煤矿关停，京西地区如何走好产业转型发展“关键一步”，成为社会各界共同关心的问题。\n　　本次研讨会聚焦石景山文化事业与文化产业发展，吸引了众多民建企业家、文博从业者和工艺美术师参与，探讨京西地区转型过程中的机遇与挑战：当以博物馆为代表的文化事业与文化产业接轨，如何把握好传承与创新之间的平衡，唤醒“老物件”的“新生机”？\n　　“博物馆自身运行维护成本高，又面临着经费来源单一、市场‘冷热不均’等问题，需要创新运营理念，在公益性和商业化之间取得平衡。”全国新的社会阶层人士服务团分团秘书长、尚游汇文旅董事长钟晖长期关注“小众”博物馆的经营状况，他建议，博物馆可以从体验数字化、服务社群化、展陈场景化、藏品IP化、参观线路产品化入手，改善运营模式。\n　　“历史本身具有‘温度’，博物馆需要创新展陈方式，将这种‘温度’传递给观众。”会上，北京观复博物馆社教部主任刘熙一边说一边“晒”出了一组照片：多位观复博物馆的“小粉丝”长大后故地重游，与喜爱的展品合影。\n　　在刘熙看来，观复博物馆之所以能让观众长久地记住，得益于有“温度”的展陈。走进陶瓷馆，每件展品下方都额外设置了一枚镜子，方便观众看清瓷器底部，详细了解其生产年代与烧造工艺；家具馆、门窗馆则采用不设围栏的“裸展”形式，允许观众近观桌椅门窗的一梁一柱、一榫一卯，仿佛步入古人生活。\n　　文博从业者让观众走近文物，工艺美术师则致力于让文物走向观众。例如，金漆镶嵌髹饰技艺出自古代宫廷，成品以大型家居为主，北京金漆镶嵌艺术博物馆北京工艺美术大师石燕玲打破常规，设计出了首饰盒、食盒、台灯、腕表、胸针饰品等小物件，满足现代生活所需，助力传统技艺实现“活态”传承。\n　　除了有形的工艺作品，无形的传统艺术同样能为区域发展注入文化活力。本次研讨会上，民建会员、中国东方乐团团长姜淼现场演奏了古筝协奏曲《红山魂》，并表示将带领乐团在石景山举办音乐会、艺术节、古筝比赛等文化活动，助力西山永定河文化发展传播；民建会员、国家级非物质文化遗产代表性项目“傅氏幻术”传承人傅琰东则建议将魔术融入文旅产业发展，打造魔术餐厅、魔术酒吧、魔法民宿等业态，探索石景山文化产业新路径。(完)(《中国新闻》报 任德辉 报道)",
