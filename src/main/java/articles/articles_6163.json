    "text": "Vier Jahre nach der Flutkatastrophe hat das Land 2,2 Milliarden für den Wiederaufbau ausgezahlt. Die bereitstehenden 12,3 Milliarden Euro würden wohl nicht in voller Höhe benötigt.\nAnzeige Vier Jahre nach der Flut-Katastrophe in Nordrhein-Westfalen sind 4,3 Milliarden Euro für den Wiederaufbau bewilligt und 2,2 Milliarden Euro ausgezahlt. Das hat die Landesregierung mitgeteilt.\nDie insgesamt rund 12,3 Milliarden Euro, die zur Verfügung stehen, werden absehbar nicht in voller Höhe benötigt werden, teilte Bauministerin Ina Scharrenbach (CDU) mit. Es seien deutlich mehr der betroffenen Gebäude gegen Elementarrisiken versichert gewesen als zunächst angenommen.\nAnzeige Rund 865 Millionen Euro seien für privat genutzte Wohngebäude und den Ersatz von Hausrat bewilligt worden. Von den mehr als 27.000 Anträgen seien über 98 Prozent abschließend bearbeitet. 85 Prozent der Mittel seien ausgezahlt.\nFür den Wiederaufbau der Infrastruktur in den Kommunen wurden rund 2,8 Milliarden Euro bewilligt. Aktuell seien davon erst rund 903 Millionen Euro ausgezahlt. «Da hakt es in Teilen der Kommunen unverständlicherweise. Wir haben in den letzten Wochen und Monaten noch mal nachgearbeitet und unterstützt», sagte Scharrenbach dem WDR.\nAnzeige So biete das Land den Kommunen die Finanzierung einzelner Bauabschnitte an, damit die Kommunen die Projekte nicht komplett vorfinanzieren müssen. Die übrigen Mittel der insgesamt bewilligten 4,3 Milliarden Euro entfallen auf Unternehmen, die Land- und Forstwirtschaft, die Infrastruktur der Länder, Forschungseinrichtungen sowie Archive.\nBetrugsverdacht bei weniger als einem Prozent der Fälle Von den bewilligten Anträgen seien 320 Betrugsverdachtsfälle mit einem Volumen von 8,8 Millionen Euro identifiziert worden. Dies sei weniger als ein Prozent der Bewilligungen.\nWeitere 272 Betrugsfälle seien vor der Bewilligung im Bearbeitungsverfahren aufgedeckt worden. Insgesamt wurden 475 Fälle an die jeweils zuständige Staatsanwaltschaft abgegeben. Bei den übrigen 117 Betrugsverdachtsfällen werde der Sachverhalt weiter aufgeklärt.\nDurch Sturzfluten und Überschwemmungen hatten am 14. und 15. Juli 2021 allein in NRW 49 Menschen ihr Leben verloren. Der Sachschaden erreichte Milliardenhöhe.\ndpa-infocom GmbH",

I hope you keep putting a smile on people’s faces like you’ve just put a smile on mine.’\nHe said he’d be using some of the money to help other people.\n‘There’s plenty of people that need help that I know of.

    "text": "TOWANDA, Pa. — People packed into the commissioners room at the Bradford County Courthouse in Towanda to learn the fate of the Bradford County Library. \"The ultimate goal is for the library to remain open, and functional to serve the community,\" said interim library director Rebecca Troup-Hodgdon. And the library near Troy will remain open. This all started back in September when commissioners unveiled a plan to move the county's veteran services office inside the space currently occupied by the library. Commissioners also wanted to reallocate half of the library's $455,000 budget across 8 other smaller libraries in the county. \"So if you have something you feel is over budgeted, you work to get that budget under control. We did meet with them, and I hope they can come back and say how can we make this work. We have some ideas here,\" said Commissioner Doug McLinko, Those ideas include a list of recommendations from the library advisory committee. They include reducing the number of hours the library is open each week to 45 hours. Commissioners also plan to transition the Bradford County Library from its current status as an agency of the Bradford County government to an independent nonprofit, along with hiring an outside library consultant to oversee the changes. \"We are going to have someone come in who understands this because it is all over the place and to make recommendations. Take a look at our library, the bookmobile; take a look at everything and bring it together to better utilize and serve the community,\" said Commissioner McLinko, Interim Library Director Rebecca Troup-Hodgdon says that she can't comment on the specifics of the recommendations just yet. She says the funding for the library in the county budget is justified. \"Libraries continue to be one of the free county resources that is open to everyone, and I encourage everyone to check out any of the libraries in Bradford County, we are a wealth of knowledge and we are here for your families,\" said Troup-Hodgdon. County commissioners did not provide a timeline on when that library consultant could step in.",

    "title": "Scientists Hack Human Eye to See a Whole New Color, Called \"Olo\"",
    "text": "The human eye can see millions of colors — but no eyes have ever before beheld \"olo.\"\nOnly five people on the planet have witnessed this brand new color, thanks to the efforts of a team of researchers in California. And to earn this exclusive privilege, they had to fire laser pulses into their eyeballs.\nAs detailed in a new study published in the journal Science Advances, the pulses stimulated specific cells in the participants' retinas without activating the others, producing a hue of unconquerable saturation that's impossible to see naturally. According to the lucky few, the color's closest analog to us unenlightened humans is turquoise — but this apparently doesn't do it justice.\n\"There is no way to convey that color in an article or on a monitor,\" study coauthor Austin Roorda, a vision scientist at UC Berkeley, told The Guardian. \"The whole point is that this is not the color we see, it's just not. The color we see is a version of it, but it absolutely pales by comparison with the experience of olo.\"\nOur perception of color is determined by photoreceptor cells in the retina called cones, of which there are three types: L cones for long wavelengths of light, M cones for medium wavelengths, and S cones for short wavelengths.\nL cones pick up the colors we see as red light, M cones as green light, and S cones as blue light. Naturally, colors tend to be a blend of these spectrums. And while L cones and S cones can largely be stimulated on their own, that isn't the case for M cones; the light they react to also activates either the L or S cones, too.\n\"There's no light in the world that can activate only the M cone cells because, if they are being activated, for sure one or both other types get activated as well,\" coauthor Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley, told Scientific American.\nBut the researchers found a way to cheat that situation. First, they mapped each participant's retinas to find the position of their M cones. They then applied these findings in the setting of a dark lab, where the participant keeps still as a tiny pulse of light is fired into each M cone cell, one at a time. As the cells are lasered into, a magnificent turquoise patch roughly twice the size of a full moon forms in the subject's field of vision, per the Guardian. The effect is temporary, but the impression it leaves, apparently, is long-lasting.\n\"It's a fascinating study, a truly groundbreaking advance in the ability to understand the photoreceptor mechanisms underlying color vision. The technical demands necessary to achieve this are enormous,\" Manuel Spitschan, a research leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany who was not involved in study, told Scientific American. \"An open question, is how this advance can be used.\"\nOthers aren't convinced that it's anything more than a neat party trick.\n\"It is not a new color,\" John Barbur, a professor of optics and visual science at City St George's, University of London, told the Guardian. \"It's a more saturated green that can only be produced in a subject with normal red-green chromatic mechanism when the only input comes from M cones.\" Barbur said that the work had \"limited value.\"\nNg hopes the technology could one day be applied to create screens that are tailor-made to deliver perfect colors to your retinas, he told Scientific American. It could also let color blind patients see certain colors for the first time — but only temporarily.\nMore on vision: Neuralink Competitor Restores Vision in Blind Patients With Eye Implant\nShare This Article",
