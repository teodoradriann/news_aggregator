    "text": "Classroom Champions: Reicher’s TJ Bradley\nWACO, Texas (KWTX) - Bishop Reicher’s TJ Bradley is a true multi-sport athlete.\nOver the course of his athletic career, he’s been named All-District in football and baseball, and basketball. He was also selected to the All-State basketball team and even set the Reicher school record for points scored.\nWhen I play sports, I kind of get to think and be strategic about it,” said Bradley. “You got to pick up on your opponent’s weaknesses, what they’re good at and try to outplay them. I think that’s something I’ve always been drawn towards.”\nThat drive and competitiveness carries over to the classroom, though, it hasn’t always been a breeze.\nTJ is dyslexic, yet, he carries a 4.45 GPA. He says staying active has helped him the most.\n“I like being active, it goes hand in hand with my learning style,” said Bradley. “I’m very much an active learner and I like to be doing things. I have to fidget and I have to be moving.”\nTJ is on track to graduate as class salutatorian. He’s looking forward to studying engineering at his dream school down in College Station.\n“I’ve always wanted to, since I was probably like five, go to A&M,” said Bradley. “Knowing that in high school, A&M’s automatic acceptance is top 10 percent. I know it’s a difficult school to get into. If I do well in school, I get to go to A&M and I get to follow in the lineage of my parents.”\nBefore he heads off to Texas A&M, TJ says he’s most focused on growing in his faith. It’s the most important part of his life.\n“I’ve noticed that I’ve grown deeper in love,” said Bradley. “When things go wrong, I can kind of just be like, ‘Hey Jesus, this is how I’m feeling, I don’t really understand why things are like this, I’m kind of stressed out. I need your help to calm down and focus on you and put what is stressing me behind.”\nCongratulations to TJ Bradley, you’re a Classroom Champion!\nCopyright 2025 KWTX. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "By This article was brought to you by Lake Grove Dental, Lake Oswego Review Expert. Sponsored Content ,\n1 hour ago\nBeing voted the best dentist in town is an esteemed recognition accompanied by significant responsibilities. It symbolizes not only professional competence but also a commitment to exemplary patient care and satisfaction. This accolade carries more weight than mere acknowledgment; it signifies a mandate to maintain the highest standards of dentistry and ethical conduct.First and foremost, being bestowed with the title dentist means we assume the responsibility for the oral health of our community. Patients entrust their well-being to us, expecting expert guidance, compassionate care, and effective treatments; all in an office using the most contemporary equipment and materials. We must continually enhance expertise through ongoing education, staying abreast of the latest advancements in dentistry.We began as a small three operatory office in the First Addition; fostering trust and cultivating strong patient relationships has been the backbone of Lake Grove Dental since 1960. Attentive listening, clear communication of procedures, and involving patients in treatment decisions are paramount to establishing a supportive and comfortable environment.Using a conservative approach to restorative care and doing biomimetic dentistry (replicating the strength, function, and esthetics of natural teeth by replacing only damaged, decayed, and broken tooth structure whenever possible) is Dr. Branen’s mantra. Understanding the connection of oral health to total health, and helping our patients understand that too, is also an important part of what we do.We thank all who voted for us and will strive to always hit the high bar for our community.",

    "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more .\nCNN — In an ancient grave in what’s now northwestern Argentina, a person was buried with a canine companion — but this animal friend wasn’t a dog, according to new research. The burial held the skeleton of a type of canid that may have once competed with dogs for human affection: a fox.\nHumans and dogs have a long history. The relationship between the two species is tens of thousands of years old. However, a fresh analysis of evidence from a Patagonian burial dating back about 1,500 years hints at a similar close connection between a hunter-gatherer in southern South America and the large extinct fox species Dusicyon avus.\nA new study shows that dogs migrated with humans from East Asia through the Bering Land Bridge to the Americas. Ettore Mazza Related article Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study says\nArchaeologists originally uncovered the near-complete D. avus skeleton buried alongside a human at Cañada Seca, a site in northern Patagonia, in 1991. There were no cut marks on the bones, so the fox hadn’t been eaten, said Dr. Ophélie Lebrasseur , a researcher with the Wellcome Trust Palaeogenomics and Bio-Archaeology Research Network at the University of Oxford’s School of Archaeology in the United Kingdom.\nAn in-depth analysis of ancient DNA and radiocarbon dating confirmed the fox’s species and age, and examination of collagen in the fox’s remains revealed that it ate the same food that this group of humans did. Along with the skeleton’s placement in the grave, the animal’s diet suggested that the fox was tame and may have been kept as a pet, scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science .\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence from burial sites on other continents indicating that individual foxes were tamed by humans and shared a connection based on companionship.\nThe fox and hunter-gatherer society D. avus lived from the Pleistocene Epoch (around 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) into the Holocene, becoming extinct about 500 years ago. It was roughly the size of a modern German shepherd but far less bulky, weighing up to 33 pounds (15 kilograms).\nParts of the D. avus specimen were buried alongside a human at Cañada Seca, a site in northern Patagonia. Courtesy Francisco Prevosti “In general, Dusicyon avus has a carnivorous kind of diet,” said Lebrasseur, who co-led the study with Dr. Cinthia Abbona , a researcher with Argentina’s National Scientific and Technical Research Council. But when the scientists tested the fox skeleton from the burial, they found that its diet was less carnivorous than expected, and more similar to the diets of humans.\n“That suggests either the community was feeding it, or it was around the community and feeding on the kitchen refuse,” Lebrasseur told CNN. “It would suggest that there’s a closer relationship and integration of the canid within the society.”\nThe notion of foxes as pets in South America aligns with evidence from other fox burials in Europe and Asia, said Dr. Aurora Grandal-d’Anglade , a paleobiologist at the Universidade da Coruña in Spain. Grandal-d’Anglade, who was not involved in the new study, previously described Bronze Age graves in the Iberian Peninsula that included dozens of dogs and four foxes buried alongside people. Researchers found that the foxes had been arranged much like the dogs were, suggesting that they, too, were companions for humans.\nOverview of the archaeological excavations in Malomirovo, Bulgaria Michał Podsiadło Related article Skeletons buried on the Eurasian steppe reveal the earliest known horse riders\n“There is no reason why foxes could not be domesticated,” Grandal-d’Anglade told CNN in an email. “We know that humans in many completely different societies often keep domestic animals (not only canids, but e.g. monkeys, birds, reptiles) simply as companion animals. When viewed in this light, more and more sites appear where foxes seem to have played the role of pet animals.”\nFinding D. avus in a human grave was surprising for another reason — while the species was once widespread across southern South America, it was previously unknown in this part of Patagonia. Hunter-gatherers who lived in the region typically stayed within a range of about 44 miles (70 kilometers), so they likely encountered the friendly fox within that range, according to the study.\n“The Dusicyon avus must have been part of the nearby vicinity, to be able to be integrated within the community,” Lebrasseur said.\nWhat fox burials reveal about ‘man’s best friend’ The analysis also shed light on what drove the foxes to extinction — or rather, what didn’t. One hypothesis suggested that the foxes interbred with dogs that European colonizers introduced to South America, and that interbreeding eventually caused the foxes’ lineage to peter out. But the fox’s DNA told a different story, the study authors reported.\n“Based on what we were able to recover and the technique that we developed at Oxford a few years ago, we were able to suggest that the hybridization between domestic dogs and Dusicyon avus would not have been able to produce fertile offspring,” Lebrasseur said.\nD. avus lived from the Pleistocene Epoch (around 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) into the Holocene, becoming extinct about 500 years ago.

With a similar diet to D. avus, dogs may have helped speed the foxes’ extinction by outcompeting them. Dogs could also have carried and transmitted diseases that sickened the foxes, Lebrasseur added.\nShutterstock Related article At least five types of dog existed by the end of the Ice Age, 11,000 years ago\nExperts often explain dog domestication as something that happened because humans realized that they could put dogs to work as hunters or herders, Grandal-d’Anglade said. But the D. avus skeleton at Cañada Seca and other fox burials hint that an animal didn’t need to be a useful worker to be nurtured by humans — it could simply be a friend.\n“The proliferation of canids of different species in close relationship with humans seems to indicate that in principle it was a relationship of affection, of companionship,” Grandal-d’Anglade said. “The fact that we find them in so many different societies and on different continents indicates that keeping animals for companionship, and not only as working or meat animals, is an ancestral trait in humans.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.",

Después de ese tiempo, se espera que este sistema se absorba en el área de baja presión sobre el Caribe.\nEsta depresión puede provocar posibles lluvias localmente fuertes durante los próximos días a través de Puerto Rico y la Española hasta el este de Cuba y el sureste de Bahamas.",
