Las protestas contra la nueva política migratoria de la Administración Trump se extienden por hasta 13 estados EEUU anuncia el despliegue de 700 marines en Los Ángeles - Foto: Europa Press/Contacto/Amy Katz El Mando Norte de Estados Unidos ha anunciado este miércoles que desplegará en las próximas 48 horas a 700 marines en Los Ángeles tras haber completado su entrenamiento, en el marco de una nueva escalada de las protestas iniciadas en el pasado viernes en la ciudad californiana y que se han extendido a múltiples ciudades de hasta trece estados de Estados Unidos en contra de las deportaciones y redadas del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE) contra la migración irregular.Los marines se unirán de esta forma a la Policía de Los Ángeles y a más de 4.000 soldados de la Guardia Nacional, 2.100 de ellos ya desplegados y la otra mitad movilizada para el jueves, según ha explicado el general Scott Sherman, que encabeza la operación.De todas formas, \"el papel aún no está claro\" para ninguno de los tres cuerpos de seguridad desplegados, ha declarado a CNN el jefe del Departamento de Policía de Los Ángeles, Jim McDonnell, que ha destacado que \"esto no tiene precedentes\".En la ciudad angelina, las protestas han continuado por sexto día consecutivo aun a pesar del toque de queda, que ha comenzado a las 20.00 (hora local) y tras el que la CNN ha informado de entre 20 y 30 detenciones, además de disparos con pelotas de goma y Policía montada para dispersar a los manifestantes.Además, el gobernador de California, Gavin Newsom, ha denunciado en la red social X que un \"incendio de Ranch, en San Bernardino, (a menos de 100 km de Los Ángeles) abarca 4.000 acres (1.619 hectáreas) y sigue creciendo. Mientras tanto, cinco de los 14 equipos de bomberos de la Guardia Nacional de California tienen poco personal porque Trump los desplegó para un acto político en Los Ángeles\". \"Esto no sólo es ilegal. Es peligroso\", ha añadido.Paralelamente, las protestas se han extendido a múltiples ciudades de hasta 13 estados del país y en Washington D.C. En Spokane, estado de Washington, se ha declarado el estado de emergencia y un toque de queda y se han realizado más de 30 arrestos.También han sido escenario de intensas protestas ciudades como Nueva York, Las Vegas o Indiana, donde la multitud ha rodeado el estadio de los Indiana Pacers de la NBA en el marco del tercer partido de las finales en las que se enfrentan a los Oklahoma City Thunder. , , , , , , , , , , , ,",

    "text": "( MENAFN - 3BL) Sara Rosner | Director of Environmental Research and Engagement-Responsibility\nPatrick O'Connell, CFA | Director-Fixed Income Responsible Investing Research\nDavid Tsoupros, CFA | Senior Research Analyst-Concentrated Growth\nFrom South Africa's endangered black rhinoceros to the shrinking Amazon rainforest, threats to the variability of life on Earth are mounting. Protecting biodiversity-animals, plants and other living organisms, and the ecosystems they are part of-is vital to maintaining the health of our planet and the products, services and economic activity that sustain our daily life. Yet until recently, biodiversity hasn't ranked highly among investors' priorities.\nThis may seem surprising, given biodiversity's importance as the living component of the natural world. Together with abiotic resources-the nonliving components of the natural world, such as land, water, air and minerals-biodiversity comprises natural capital, the world's stock of natural assets.\nNatural capital provides the building blocks that enable ecosystem services-the positive benefits that societies and economies derive from nature-to sustain life and create wealth. That's why biodiversity loss alone could cost the global economy trillions of dollars in the coming years, in addition to trillions more related to climate change.\nBiodiversity is, quite simply, the world's life support system, the foundation from which nearly all goods and services are produced.\nWeb of Life: Biodiversity Risks Are Highly Complex\nFor many years, governments and investors have focused on the material impacts of climate change, with little consideration for the role of the natural world. But today there is a growing recognition of the high degree of interconnectivity and myriad feedback loops between climate change and nature-and a greater appreciation of the risks associated with biodiversity.\nThe interconnectedness within and across ecosystems makes biodiversity risk especially complex. Ecosystem services can be grouped into four interconnected categories: the regulation of natural ecosystem processes, such as pollination; the provisioning of physical products, including food; the cultural or nonmaterial benefits that arise from a harmonious relationship between people and their environments; and, most importantly, the supportive infrastructure of oxygen production, water and nutrient cycles, and soil formation, which makes all other ecosystem services possible (Display).\nThe idea of interconnectedness is important when considering the drivers of biodiversity loss. Changing land use (such as deforestation ) and sea use has been one of the largest threats to biodiversity. According to the World Wildlife Fund , land conversion is the main reason for a 69% decline in wildlife populations (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish) since 1970.\nBut deforestation not only affects wildlife; it also impinges on climate. The Amazon rainforest, for example, currently absorbs 30% less carbon dioxide than it did in the 1990s due to deforestation to make way for cattle farms. Deforestation reduces the forest's capacity to store and release moisture into the atmosphere.\nThis reduction in moisture from the Amazon has major implications for the global hydrological cycle -the processes of rain, evaporation, freezing and melting around the world-which in turn negatively affects more species' habitats and changes the global climate. Deforesting a further 20% of the Amazon could release more than 90 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere-2.5 times more than annual global fossil fuel emissions.\nThere is a silver lining, because interconnectedness works both ways: tackling climate change and biodiversity loss in tandem can lead to twin wins. Steps taken to reduce deforestation in the Amazon, for example, may help to mitigate the speed and severity of climate change by creating additional carbon sinks for growing carbon flows.\nThe National Academy of Sciences in the US underscored the connection between nature and climate when it estimated that, in a below-2-degrees Celsius warming scenario, nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure and carbon sequestration and storage could carry out 37% of necessary carbon mitigation between now and 2030, and 20% between now and 2050.\nIn other words, tackling biodiversity loss and climate change is one route to resolving two systemic issues (Display).\nSimilarly, in our view, awareness of the links between biodiversity and climate risks may help investors develop valuable insights and investable opportunities for their portfolios through carbon credits, agricultural solutions, ecotourism, water management, green infrastructure and other nature-based solutions, to name just a few.\nThe web of risks becomes even more complex when other causes of biodiversity loss are considered. Land- and sea-use change and climate change are only two of the worst drivers. Others include direct exploitation, pollution and invasive species.\nWhile changing sea and land use are currently ranked as the most destructive causes, these rankings may vary over time, adding another layer of complexity. Failure to abate climate change, for example, may lead to climate becoming the leading cause of biodiversity loss.\nInvestors face an urgent challenge in analyzing and managing these risks and opportunities. As biodiversity loss continues, the risks to companies and investment portfolios increase. And, as governments and regulators respond to biodiversity loss, the pressure builds on businesses and investors to engage with these issues, generating opportunities.\nHelping Investors Rise to the Challenge\nThe challenge of analyzing and managing nature-related risks and opportunities is not insurmountable. Investors can take practical steps to engage with biodiversity risk by understanding its place in the broad ecological structure, its role in underpinning ecosystem services and how those services interact with each other in supporting life and economic activity.\nFrom there, they can develop a framework for assessing companies' biodiversity exposures -not just physical and transition risks, but also the economic and investment opportunities that can arise from actions taken to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change. And, by applying appropriately designed conceptual frameworks and specialist data, biodiversity risk and opportunities can be calibrated at the sector and individual issuer levels and mapped to investor portfolios with the goal of unlocking better returns.\nBy using these approaches in an active strategy that combines fundamental research, third-party specialist knowledge and issuer engagement* and stewardship, investors can aim for meaningful long-term performance while helping to mitigate nature-related business and investment risks.\nThese actions alone won't solve the biodiversity crisis, but they may help to create a world in which, one day, economies will behave more like ecosystems and less like invasive species.\nFor a deeper dive into the risks and opportunities surrounding this topic, download our white paper, Biodiversity in the Balance: How Nature Poses Investment Risks and Opportunities .\n*AB engages issuers where it believes the engagement is in the best interest of its clients.\nThe authors wish to thank Max Lulavy, Environmental Research Associate, for his invaluable contribution to this research.\nThe views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.

    "text": "Man was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple. (Representational) A 41-year-old Indo-Canadian man has been arrested for multiple break-ins and thefts at Hindu temples in Canada's Durham Region and Greater Toronto Area, police said. However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday. The police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city. According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said. He was \"seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" the release said. Police say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. \"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said. Pandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.

    "text": "CHAMPAIGN — When Ameren linemen from Illinois set out to assist in recovery from Hurricane Helene, they knew it would be a different animal from repairs back home. They didn’t know they’d be carrying their tools up mountains by hand and placing new poles by helicopter in northern Virginia. “People that lived on the mountainside … it’s family-owned ground, it seemed like it was generation after generation that had been there,” said lineman Curtis Hayes. “They all know each other.” Hayes worked to bring power back after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 but said the mountainous landscape this time around created totally different challenges, as sliding mud and water loosened entire trees that hit and broke power poles. Derek Rhodes wasn’t working at Ameren yet when Katrina hit, so this was his first hurricane response. Both typically work in the Champaign County area and were just some of the 125 Ameren personnel and 250 contractor personnel sent out east to help. “We did hear that they had maybe asked other crews and they said no,” Rhodes said of one of the first jobs their crew took on. “We heard this after we were up in the mountains. … We didn’t complain; we grabbed our stuff and started marching up there.” By “marching up there,” Rhodes means a mile-and-a-half climb up a mountain, bringing the crew to around 4,200 feet in elevation, where the air was thin enough to be noticeable. Once up there, they were digging poles out by hand in an area with no phone service ... which also meant no lunch drop-offs on 7 a.m.-to-11 p.m. work days. The crew worked on power lines for rural areas, typically serving scattered individual families. Both Hayes and Rhodes said they were impressed with the folks out in the mountains who never seemed to complain and were always willing to help. “They’re used to a simpler way of life out in the mountains,” Hayes said. “When we do storms in town, people think we’re just supposed to flip a switch and get their lights back on. These people, they were super helpful and kind of used to it.” People shared their vehicles in areas Ameren trucks couldn’t access or got a hold of their neighbors to make sure workers could get on their land. Others gathered at a school that had to be closed to cook all the food that would’ve been for the kids and offer it to work crews; they fed at least 250 crews one day. Finally back after a 10-day stint, the linemen are just waiting to see if they’ll be called on to help in the wake of Hurricane Milton.",

    "title": "Un estudio revela que los niños con asma tienen más probabilidades de desarrollar Alzheimer durante la vejez - Libertad Digital",
    "text": "El asma es una enfermedad de los bronquios causada por la inflamación y contracción de los músculos que rodean las vías respiratorias. Algunos de sus síntomas son dificultades en la respiración, tos, falta de aire, ruidos a la hora de respirar y opresión en el pecho. Estos pueden ser graves y desaparecer o aparecer con el tiempo. Además, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), las muertes por asma aumentarán en los próximos 10 años si no se comienzan a tomar medidas urgentes.\nEn España, el asma afecta a unos 2,5 millones de personas , de las cuales 397.000 son niños, lo que representa un 5,7% de la población menor de 14 años, según un estudio en la revista de la Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica. De hecho, el asma es la enfermedad crónica más común en la población pediátrica española, es uno de los motivos de consulta más frecuente y una de las mayores causas de hospitalizaciones.\nDistingue los síntomas de alergia y asma durante la cuarentena: ¿cuándo debo preocuparme? LD/Quiron Salud En los últimos años, se han publicado diversos estudios relacionando el asma con otras enfermedades. Ciertamente, se ha encontrado una conexión entre esta enfermedad en pacientes niños y el riesgo de desarrollar Alzheimer durante la vejez . Esto se manifiesta en un nuevo estudio de la Universidad de California en Davis (Estados Unidos), publicado en \"JAMA Network Open\", una revista médica publicada por la American Medical Association (AMA).\nEl estudio ha examinado la relación entre el asma infantil y las dificultades cognitivas, centrándose en la memoria episódica y la función ejecutiva. A pesar de que el asma es la enfermedad más común en los niños, no hay estudios que hayan profundizado en cómo afecta a su desarrollo cognitivo. El estudio de la Universidad de California ha investigado si los niños con asma presentan un rendimiento más bajo en tareas de memoria en comparación con los niños sin asma. Para ello, se han incluido los datos de 2.062 niños de 9 a 10 años que padecen la enfermedad.\nLa infancia, período de mejora en la memoria Según Nicholas Christopher-Hayes, primer autor del estudio, \"la infancia es un período de rápida mejora en la memoria y en la cognición. En los niños con asma, esta mejora puede ser más lenta\". Para el estudio, se utilizaron varias pruebas cognitivas que consistieron en exámenes de memoria de secuencias de imágenes, velocidad de procesamiento de patrones y pruebas de control y atención.\nRelacionado Los Jaume I premian los avances en investigación cuántica, biomedicina, el conocimiento de la sequía y el asma infantil Una experta revela los secretos de la microbiota: influye en todo el organismo Protege tus huesos del frío: consejos médicos para mantener la salud ósea durante el invierno Se esperaba que los niños con asma, especialmente aquellos con un inicio más temprano de la enfermedad, tuvieran un rendimiento cognitivo más bajo en tareas relacionadas con la memoria episódica. Esta memoria incluye la forma en la que recordamos experiencias y emociones , como eventos y las personas que estuvieron allí. Por ejemplo, cuando tu abuelo te regaló un peluche en tu décimo cumpleaños.\nLa memoria episódica y el hipocampo El análisis reveló que los niños asmáticos obtuvieron puntuaciones mucho más bajas en la prueba de memoria episódica que los niños sin la enfermdad. También se realizó una muestra más pequeña con 473 niños a quienes se hizo un seguimiento durante dos años. Esta muestra dio como resultado que los niños que habían comenzado a tener la enfermedad en una edad más temprana o que llevaban más tiempo padeciéndola mostraban un peor desarrollo de la memoria con el tiempo.\nSin embargo, ¿por qué los niños asmáticos tienen más posibilidades de desarrollar a lo largo del tiempo problemas con la memoria? Se han realizado investigaciones con roedores que demuestran que los medicamentos para el asma tienen un impacto en el hipocampo : una estructura cerebral localizada en el lóbulo temporal del cerebro muy relacionada con los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria. Aunque no está demostrado que las investigaciones con roedores sean equivalentes a los seres humanos, podría ser una de las razones de la hipótesis del estudio.\nTemas Enfermedad de Alzheimer",

    "text": "Israel Considers Military Action Against Iran Amidst Nuclear Deal Concerns\nTensions are escalating in the Middle East as Israel weighs potential military action against Iran. This consideration comes amidst ongoing negotiations between The United States and Iran regarding a diplomatic agreement aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program. According to multiple sources familiar with the situation, this action is highly likely to occur without direct United States support.\nHeightened Concerns Over Nuclear Program Israel’s increased seriousness about a unilateral strike stems from concerns that The United States and Iran are nearing a preliminary agreement. This framework includes provisions regarding uranium enrichment that Israel finds unacceptable, viewing them as a threat to its national security.\nA unilateral strike would represent a meaningful departure from the stance of The Trump Administration, which has historically advised against such actions.\nTrump Administration Response and Readiness The Trump Administration is currently awaiting a response from Iran regarding a proposed framework for a nuclear deal. Publicly, President Trump has stated that Tehran has adopted a more hard-line approach in these negotiations.\nAmidst these rising tensions, the Trump Administration has directed all embassies within striking distance of Iranian missiles, aircraft, and other assets to submit detailed risk assessments and outline measures to protect American personnel and infrastructure. This directive includes missions in The Middle East,Northern Africa,and Eastern Europe.\nUnited States officials remain on high alert, anticipating the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran. The White house, though, has not yet briefed senior lawmakers on this critical issue.\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for Iran to retaliate against United States personnel or assets in the region should military action occur.\nPotential United States Support Despite Israel’s reliance on United states intelligence and logistical support, any unilateral action against Tehran is expected to proceed without planned United States involvement. Possible United States assistance could be limited to aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but no concrete plans are currently in place.\nThe United States has already announced the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. Furthermore, The Defense department has authorized the voluntary departure of military families from locations within the United States Central Command area of operations.\nGeneral erik Kurilla, the CENTCOM commander, had his scheduled testimony on Capitol Hill postponed, reportedly to focus on the evolving situation.\niran’s Air Defense Capabilities Another critical factor is Iran’s ongoing efforts to rebuild its strategic air defenses. Recent intelligence suggests that manned strikes are becoming increasingly dangerous for Israeli pilots. While Israel inflicted significant damage on Iran’s air defense systems in October, much of the damaged equipment, particularly radars, is being rapidly repaired or replaced. Consequently, the window for Israeli manned strikes is potentially closing.\nWhile Israel would prefer United States military and intelligence support for strikes, especially against Iranian nuclear facilities, past operations have demonstrated their capacity to act independently.\nExpert Analysis and Diplomatic Messaging Michael Knights of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy suggests that the evacuation of nonessential staff from The United States Embassy in Iraq sends a clear message to Tehran. This message indicates that President Trump might not restrain Israel from launching a threatened attack on Iran.\n“It’s about trying to get iran to respect the president’s wishes,” knights stated,emphasizing the diplomatic signaling behind the actions.\nIran has missed a two-month deadline set by President Trump to reach an agreement on its nuclear activities, leading to growing frustration, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nBoth knights and other informed sources indicate uncertainty regarding whether Israel will undertake a limited military strike immediately or await further developments in nuclear negotiations.\nPresident Trump has voiced increasing dissatisfaction with Iran’s negotiating stance, describing Tehran as inflexible and slow-moving in recent indirect talks.\n“They’re just asking for things that you can’t do. They don’t want to give up what they have to give up,” President Trump told reporters, highlighting the impasse. “They seek enrichment.We can’t have enrichment.”\nIsrael-Iran Conflict : Key Considerations Factor Description Trigger Dissatisfaction with Iran’s nuclear enrichment program and perceived slow\nprogress in negotiations.\nU.S. Role Likely limited to intelligence sharing and aerial refueling. Iranian Response Potential retaliation against U.S. assets and personnel in the region. Israeli Capability Demonstrated capacity for unilateral action despite preferring U.S. support. Strategic Impact Heightened tensions and potential escalation of conflict in the middle East. Understanding The Broader Context of The Israel-Iran conflict The tensions between Israel and Iran are rooted in decades of geopolitical and ideological rivalry.A key aspect of this conflict is Iran’s nuclear program, which Israel views as an existential threat.\n“Did You Know?” The Stuxnet virus, discovered in 2010, significantly hampered Iran’s nuclear enrichment program and was widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israel cyber operation.\nThe role of proxy groups like Hezbollah influences the dynamics.\n“Pro Tip:” Monitoring these proxy activities provides critical insights into potential escalation triggers.\nGeopolitical analysts emphasize that understanding the internal dynamics within both countries is crucial for anticipating future actions.Economic pressures,leadership changes,and public opinion all play significant roles in shaping policy decisions.\nHow do you think these internal pressures might influence the likelihood of military action?\nFrequently Asked Questions About The Israel-Iran Conflict Why is Israel considering military action against iran? Israel is concerned about the ongoing nuclear deal negotiations between The United States and Iran, particularly regarding uranium enrichment provisions.\nWhat could be the U.S. response to an Israeli strike? The United States might offer intelligence sharing or aerial refueling but is unlikely to provide direct kinetic support.\nWhat are the main concerns regarding the Israel Iran conflict? A major concern is potential retaliation by Iran against United States personnel and assets in the region, escalating the conflict.\nHow are nuclear negotiations affecting potential military actions? The perceived slow progress and inflexible stance of Iran in nuclear talks are contributing to Israel’s consideration of unilateral action.\nWhat is the current state of Iran’s air defenses? Iran is actively rebuilding its strategic air defenses, potentially reducing the window of opportunity for manned strikes by Israel.\nWhat measures have been taken to protect U.S. personnel? The U.S. Administration has ordered embassies within range of Iranian assets to assess and mitigate risks,and has authorized voluntary departure of non-essential staff.\nWhat are yoru thoughts on the potential consequences of an Israeli strike on Iran? Share your opinions and analysis in the comments below.\nWhat are the moast significant potential long-term consequences of an Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, considering regional and international reactions?\nIsrael-Iran Conflict: Assessing the Potential for a Military Strike The ongoing Israel-iran conflict has entered a particularly tense phase, with the increasing threat of direct military confrontation. This article delves into the likelihood of an Israel military strike on Iran ,breaking down the critical factors at play,the military capabilities of both sides,and the potential ramifications of escalation. We will explore various aspects of this complex geopolitical puzzle, including Iranian nuclear program advancements, and the persistent danger within the Middle East conflict . The focus is on delivering an informative and authoritative overview of the situation, considering potential scenarios and their consequences. Key search terms such as “Iran nuclear deal”, “Israeli military”, and “regional stability” will be thoroughly discussed.\nFactors Influencing Military Action: A Complex Equation Several elements contribute to the escalating tensions and the constant speculation surrounding the possibility of an Israel strike on Iran . These include ideological differences, proxy conflicts, and strategic gains. Moreover, the status of the iran nuclear program plays a significant role. Actions and events concerning “Tehran’s nuclear ambitions” directly influence the likelihood of an armed confrontation.\nIran’s Nuclear Ambitions and International Responses The primary driver of this conflict remains Iran’s controversial nuclear program. While Iran officially maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, international concerns persist regarding its uranium enrichment activities and nuclear weapons capabilities. The joint Extensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was designed to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the United States’ withdrawal from the JCPOA and subsequent sanctions, added more pressure on Iran, and led to iran increasing its activities in the nuclear field. The response from the Israeli government is often very strong, and they have made it clear that they would not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\nKey Considerations:\nUranium Enrichment Levels: The level of enrichment is a crucial factor. Weapons-grade uranium requires enrichment to approximately 90%, and any developments at this level are critically monitored. International Sanctions: The effectiveness of sanctions imposed on iran and its ability to circumvent them impact its economic and military capabilities. Intelligence Assessments: Crucial details on Iran’s ongoing nuclear program and any progress towards a nuclear weapon is gathered by global intelligence agencies. For more detailed information, please refer to reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) .\nProxy Conflicts and covert Operations beyond the nuclear ambitions, the Israel-Iran conflict is fought through proxy conflicts in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and other regions. Both sides have been accused of supporting and arming different groups in the area.\nThese activities include:\nHezbollah (Lebanon): Iran supports Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group with considerable military capabilities, posing a direct threat to Israel. Hamas (gaza): Hamas receives support from iran. Syria: Iran maintains a military presence in Syria, which has been the target of repeated israeli airstrikes aimed at Iranian-linked targets. This approach allows each nation to project power and maintain constant conflict with its enemies without directly confronting each other, preventing the potential for a full blown war at the cost of lower-scale operations and incursions.\nMilitary Capabilities and Potential Strike Scenarios If Israel were to launch an attack on Iran , it would need to overcome several strategic and military challenges. Analysis of the Israeli military and its capabilities, as well as consideration of Iran’s defense systems, is vital to understand possible strike scenarios.\nIsrael’s Military Strengths The Israeli military is renowned for its advanced technology,including:\nAir Force: Possesses advanced fighter jets (F-35,F-15,F-16) capable of long-range strikes. Intelligence: Strong intelligence gathering capabilities allow for effective targeting and situational awareness. Cyber Warfare: Cyber capabilities could play a crucial role in disrupting Iranian infrastructure. Iran’s Military and Defense Systems Iran has a significant military, which is also equipped with a strong defense system against attacks. Iran’s military capabilities include:\nBallistic Missiles: A large arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles capable of hitting targets throughout the Middle east. Air Defense Systems: Possesses a range of air defense systems that would try to stop an attacking force. Asymmetric Warfare: Employs asymmetric warfare tactics, including support for proxy groups, to minimize direct exposure. Possible Strike Scenarios Several military operations are within scope based on the conflict, each with potential ramifications. The main targets are the nuclear facilities and Iran’s military bases. Here are some of the potential options:\nStrike Type Potential Targets Likely Outcomes Airstrikes Nuclear facilities, military bases High risk of collateral damage, potential for retaliation from Iran or its allies. Cyberattacks Iranian infrastructure (power grids, communications) Economic disruption, limited physical impact, potential for escalating cyber warfare. Covert Operations Sabotage of critical facilities Limited impact, high deniability but potential for retaliatory measures. Potential Consequences and Ramifications A military strike, irrespective of its scope, would result in severe geopolitical impacts. Understanding the potential consequences is vital for assessing the overall risk.\nRegional Instability An attack on Iran could have devastating repercussions, including widespread regional instability. This could involve:\nRetaliatory strikes: Iran is likely to respond, potentially targeting Israeli cities or US assets in the region. Proxy wars escalation: Proxy groups, backed by Iran, may increase their attacks on israel or its allies. Economic disruption: The conflict could severely impact global oil supplies, leading to economic distress. Diplomatic and International Involvement International diplomatic efforts would intensify to contain the situation, but the risk of escalation remains high. Major players would experience some level of involvement. Potential scenarios include:\nUS involvement: Depending on the scale of the attack, the US might potentially be drawn into the conflict. UN involvement: The UN Security Council could be asked to hold an emergency meeting. Sanctions enforcement: new or stricter sanctions against Iran would be imposed, further impacting its economy. The interplay of these factors makes the Israel-Iran conflict one of the most significant geopolitical issues in the world today, with the chance of escalation always present.",

John Michael McLerran, 34, was reported to be missing on Monday, Dec. 25, after authorities responded to a welfare check around 5:30 p.m. McLerran had left his home in midtown Bend to get coffee but never returned. Police said that McLerran did not take his wallet or identification with him. Two days later, on Wednesday around 3 p.m., a community member called 911 to report that they had found McLerran stuck about six feet below street level in a dry well inside the parking lot of a gated storage unit site. Bend Police and the city's Fire & Rescue Department responded to the scene and were able to retrieve McLerran from the drain. He was later taken to a local hospital for evaluation, said the police, and is in good condition. No foul play Police said that it appeared that McLerran got into the dry well on his own and that there was no foul play. \"Our officers reviewed surveillance footage from the storage unit site and determined no criminal wrongdoing took place,\" said the police.

    "text": "Le nombre d’enfants blessés en trottinette électrique a déjà quadruplé depuis le début de l’année et la moitié des victimes n’avaient pas l’âge légal et ne portaient pas de casque, s’inquiète un hôpital de Montréal.\nVingt-sept enfants ont dû être soignés à l’hôpital de Montréal pour enfants (CUSM) pour une blessure en trottinette électrique depuis le début de la saison. C’est pratiquement quatre fois plus qu’à pareille date l’an dernier (sept blessés).\nTraumatismes crâniens ou faciaux, fractures, entorses, dents cassées, lacérations: les blessures peuvent être graves.\n«C’est une grande augmentation, s’inquiète Liane Fransblow, coordonnatrice de la traumatologie à l’hôpital de Montréal pour enfants. Il y a des blessures sévères au cerveau qui peuvent avoir des séquelles.»\nAutre fait inquiétant: la moitié des petites victimes n’avaient pas l’âge légal de 14 ans pour circuler en trottinette électrique et 50% ne portaient pas le casque, qui est pourtant obligatoire.\n«Je pense que la population ne connaît pas la loi. Il n’y a pas assez d’information», croit Mme Fransblow.\nDe son côté, l'hôpital Sainte-Justine a recensé une quinzaine d’enfants blessés en 2024, un chiffre en augmentation. Là-bas aussi, près de la moitié ne portaient pas de casque.\n«On en voit beaucoup, constate la Dre Marianne Beaudin, cheffe de traumatologie. Ça reste un moyen de transport dangereux.»\nCette dernière encourage les jeunes à rester sur les pistes cyclables pour éviter les risques de collision avec les voitures. L’an dernier, un jeune montréalais de 14 ans avait perdu la vie en traversant la rue.\nLa trottinette électrique est très populaire sur les routes depuis qu'elle a été légalisée, en 2023.\nMoins sécuritaire qu’à vélo\nSelon l’organisme Vélo Québec, elle est beaucoup moins sécuritaire qu’une bicyclette.\n«Il n’y a pas les mêmes points d’appui, c’est beaucoup plus facile d’être déstabilisé, explique Magali Bebronne, la directrice des programmes. Ce n’est pas un jouet. [...] Il y a une perception erronée que c’est sécuritaire et que les enfants sont aptes.»\nPuisque les roues de la trottinette sont petites, la chaussée cahoteuse cause beaucoup des chutes. Et souvent, le visage, la tête ou les bras absorbent le choc.\nL’hôpital pour enfants demande que l’âge minimum pour utiliser la trottinette électrique soit rehaussé à 16 ans, comme dans la plupart des provinces canadiennes.\nÀ Québec, le phénomène des trottinettes électriques ne se répercute pas encore dans les urgences pédiatriques. Les enfants se blessent davantage en VTT ou en vélo, note le Dr Pierre-Alexandre Leblanc, urgentologue au CHU de Québec.",
