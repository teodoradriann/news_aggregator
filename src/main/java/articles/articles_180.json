    "title": "Why manufacturers in India should shift to Green Utility Solutions",
    "text": "Khushboo Bhatia As the CEO of TOESL, a company at the forefront of sustainable energy solutions, I am often asked one critical question: Why should manufacturers switch to green utility solutions? The answer lies not just in addressing environmental concerns but in driving long-term business success, resilience, and leadership in sustainability. The global business landscape is rapidly evolving, and manufacturers must recognize that adopting sustainable utility solutions is not just a trend — it’s a necessity. Almost all manufacturing sectors, including food, pharma, textiles, and chemicals, require significant energy in the form of steam or thermic fluid for their operations. Conventionally, this energy has been generated through fossil fuels, a practice that is becoming increasingly unsustainable both economically and environmentally. As manufacturers strive to meet their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, switching to green energy solutions offers an unprecedented opportunity for leadership. Here’s why. Securing Energy Independence and Cost Efficiency In today’s volatile energy market, the fluctuating prices of fossil fuel leave manufacturers exposed to unpredictable supply challenges that can erode profitability. Manufacturers can significantly reduce their dependency from global supply chain disruptions by adopting green energy that utilizes locally sourced biomass fuels. Along with energy security and reliability, renewable energy solutions also deliver long-term cost savings. While initial capital expenditures may be higher, the operational costs are lower, especially considering the increasing cost of fossil fuels and the taxes associated with carbon emissions. This shift presents a unique opportunity for manufacturers to future-proof their operations against energy price shocks while lowering their total cost of energy. Driving Innovation for a Sustainable Future Adopting green utility solutions is about more than just replacing fossil fuels with green fuels like agricultural residue or conserving water through effluent treatment technologies like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD). It’s about embracing innovation and being ready for the future. Technological advancements in renewable energy are rapidly increasing performance and equipment uptime, making these solutions more viable and cost-effective for manufacturing industries. For instance, we have made significant strides in battery technology for renewable storage, such as solid-state batteries as a safer, more efficient alternative to liquid electrolyte batteries and grid-scale storage implementation that helps with grid stability and accommodates growing share of renewable energy. Similarly, biomass boilers are now more efficient and can cater to a wider range of agro-waste biomass fuels, tapping into unutilized residues making utilities sustainable and economically attractive. We are also seeing increased investments in green hydrogen, with the Green Hydrogen Mission launched in 2021, international collaborations and several pilot projects that are underway to demonstrate the feasibility of green hydrogen, especially for industrial processes and energy storage. Sustainability is no longer optional. Those who lead this transformation will be the ones to capture new market opportunities and position themselves as pioneers in their industry. Staying Ahead of Regulatory Challenges Environmental regulations are tightening across the globe. For example, the European Union implemented the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) as a regulation to reduce carbon emissions by imposing a tax on carbon-intensive imports such as iron, steel, aluminium, cement, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. Such carbon taxes, emission reduction targets, and strict environmental compliance laws are reshaping the way industries operate. Manufacturers that fail to reduce their carbon footprint will face increasing financial penalties and operational constraints, placing them at a competitive disadvantage. By switching to renewable energy, manufacturers can significantly reduce their carbon emissions and be better positioned to meet future environmental regulations. Embracing ESG Leadership through Social Responsibility Manufacturers that adopt green utility solutions are taking a leadership position in the global sustainability movement. ESG metrics are no longer a “nice-to-have”; they are becoming essential indicators of a company’s long-term viability and attractiveness to stakeholders. By switching to green utilities, companies can significantly reduce their environmental impact, contribute to local economies, and demonstrate genuine corporate responsibility. It is an opportunity to create a legacy of sustainable leadership that resonates with customers, investors, and employees alike. A Call to Lead As manufacturers, the choices we make today will determine the future of our industries and our world. The companies that choose green utilities today will secure energy stability, reduce costs, and meet the stringent regulatory requirements of tomorrow, all while fulfilling their social responsibility, and emerge as leaders in the global movement toward sustainability. Will your company be one of them? The author is CEO, Thermax Onsite Energy Solutions Limited (TOESL). Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.\",",

    "text": "Seeks vital funds to empower HBCUs and their students during this critical time\nCHICAGO – Kicking off the season of giving, UNCF (United Negro College Fund) Chicago’s 2024 #GivingTuesday campaign is encouraging giving to correct the challenges facing minority higher education.\n#GivingTuesday, a global day of giving that harnesses the collective power of individuals, communities and organizations, is set for Dec. 3 this year. #GivingTuesday officially kicks off “giving season” for UNCF, which runs through the end of the year.\nUNCF works tirelessly to benefit historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), in part, by changing the narrative of HBCUs across the nation and helping equip minority students with the resources necessary to transition into and graduate from college, and ultimately succeed in the workforce.\n“As we enter the season of giving, we hope people across the nation will give to support our cause. Students across the United States need our support,” said Maurice E. Jenkins, Jr., executive vice president and chief development officer, UNCF.\n“African American and other minority students find themselves often without the resources and opportunities to get to and through college. UNCF works to ensure a fairer playing field through our support of both our HBCUs and their students,” said UNCF Regional Development Director Lisa M. Rollins.\nThree reasons to give to UNCF during #GivingTuesday:\n· Our students are at greatest risk of not being able to continue their educational efforts due to financial need.\n· The nation’s HBCUs have been producing almost 17% of all African American graduates and nearly 20% of African American graduates in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics — the critical industries of the future.\n· UNCF can only support one out of every 10 scholarship applicants. UNCF must have the critical resources to do its important work of supporting HBCUs and our students.\n“UNCF was founded on the act of giving. Our participation in #GivingTuesday shows our steadfast commitment to supporting our member institutions and educating our students,” Rollins added.\nWays to help UNCF make a lasting impact in the life of a student:\n1. Donate today. Visit UNCF.org/Chicago and hit the “Support UNCF Chicago” button.\n2. Share your donation to UNCF on social media using #GivingTuesday.\n3. Follow #UNCF on Facebook, X @UNCF and Instagram.\n4. Give to UNCF through your office workplace campaign.\n5. Spread the word about UNCF’s mission and our large number of scholarship programs for students of color.\nFor more information about UNCF, visit UNCF.org, uncf.org/Chicago and follow on social media @UNCFChicago and #UNCFChicago.",

    "text": "Natal da Brasil Paralelo se contradiz ao tentar desmentir ‘ideologias’ O Brasil Paralelo, sofre de uma forma parecida de miopia: a de achar que apenas os outros têm “ideologia” Folhapress Reinaldo José Lopes São Carlos – SP É uma experiência esquisita assistir aos três episódios do especial de Natal do grupo de mídia conservador Brasil Paralelo, disponíveis gratuitamente no YouTube e no serviço de streaming da empresa. De um lado, muitos dos convidados do programa, comandado pelos apresentadores Luís Ernesto Lacombe e Lara Brenner, poderiam estar participando de um especial natalino típico da TV aberta brasileira, em canais como o SBT ou a Record. Reunidos num teatro em São Paulo, eles contam histórias, como o diagnóstico e o tratamento do câncer de um filho ainda bebê, ou a adoção de dezenas de crianças e adolescentes que viviam em abrigos pelo mesmo casal -situações “inspiradoras”, para usar o adjetivo da moda, escolhidas para comover. E, de fato, genuinamente emocionantes em diversos casos. Não há motivo para duvidar da sinceridade e das boas intenções por trás desses depoimentos. Há ainda interlúdios de música clássica, com peças tipicamente natalinas que até o ouvido menos treinado acaba reconhecendo -“Adeste Fideles” ou “Jesus, Alegria dos Homens”, de Bach, por exemplo– e versos declamados pelo “poeta e cantador” Clístenes Hafner Fernandes. Há a intenção declarada de criar um espetáculo capaz de despertar “sentimentos elevados”, um contraponto à banalização da data e à frivolidade que, para a direção da Brasil Paralelo, teria tomado conta da cultura brasileira. O tom das apresentações é, além disso, explicitamente cristão e, para ser mais específico, católico, embora a influência de aspectos do pensamento evangélico também possa ser entrevista nos programas. De novo, não é nada que alguém acostumado a emissoras abertas de orientação confessional, como a Rede Vida ou a TV Canção Nova, do interior paulista, já não tenha visto antes -um dos astros da Canção Nova, o apologeta (defensor da doutrina) católico Felipe Aquino, é um dos destaques do primeiro episódio. Os depoimentos são calcados na fé dos participantes e em temas como “a vida como milagre” e “a vida como dom”. São pessoas que enxergam a intervenção divina em seus dramas do cotidiano, do resultado de um acidente de carro à decisão de abandonar tratamentos de fertilidade e buscar a adoção como forma de realizar o sonho de ter uma família numerosa. Trata-se, é claro, de um ponto de vista muito comum na cultura brasileira, e o mesmo vale para a ênfase dada aos laços familiares e sua sacralidade. É uma perspectiva tão válida quanto uma visão mais secularizada da vida. Um ruído de fundo estranho, no entanto, começa a se manifestar quando, no começo, meio e fim do especial natalino, a empresa propagandeia sua nova iniciativa, intitulada Travessia da Família. Definida no site do Brasil Paralelo como “uma curadoria de professores e temas essenciais para pais e mães”, a Travessia da Família, disponível por um valor “especial” para quem estivesse assistindo aos programas de Natal, ajudaria a garantir “uma boa educação para os filhos” e “um relacionamento a dois forte e harmônico”. O preço é de R$ 2.988 à vista, ou 12 parcelas de R$ 249. A visão apresentada pela empresa de mídia sobre os problemas familiares no Brasil de hoje é o de famílias sob cerco, com pais, mães e filhos que já não compreendem qual deveria ser o papel de cada um, sob o assédio das telas onipresentes e das “ideologias” -em especial a “ideologia de gênero”. Já se disse que mitologia é o nome que se dá à religião dos outros. O Brasil Paralelo, assim como o resto da direita radical brasileira, sofre de uma forma parecida de miopia: a de achar que apenas os outros –em especial, é claro, a esquerda– têm “ideologia”. E é nesse detalhe que os pontos cegos e contradições aparecem no programa. Ao falar da suposta confusão causada pelo ambiente atual na cabeça dos jovens, a orientadora familiar Dorita Porto comenta com espanto que um dos casais com quem trabalhou descobriu, de repente, que a filha namorava outra moça havia anos. Outra convidada conta como sofreu abusos do pai, também ao longo de anos. Em nenhum momento, diante desses fatos, os participantes se perguntam se o modelo tradicional e hierárquico de família também não é capaz de criar estruturas que favorecem distorções e injustiças. Não chega a lhes passar pela cabeça que o bicho-papão da “ideologia de gênero” pode apenas ter dado voz a pessoas –muitas delas cristãs, e que querem continuar a sê-lo– que simplesmente são incapazes de se encaixar nesse modelo de família. E continuarão a não se encaixar, por mais cursos online que a Brasil Paralelo lance. Você pode gostar JBr SHOPPING Use o código \"JBR\" e ganhe 10% de desconto",

    "text": "STORY AT-A-GLANCE\nColibactin-producing E. coli bacteria are linked to increased risks of colorectal and urinary tract cancers due to their ability to induce DNA damage, leading to tumorigenesis\nGeographical variations in cancer incidence are associated with colibactin exposure, with higher prevalence in high-Human Development Index countries, correlating with increased cancer rates in these regions\nAutophagy, the body’s natural recycling process, plays a role in inhibiting colibactin-induced carcinogenesis by repairing DNA damage and removing harmful substances\nGenetic diversity of colibactin-producing E. coli is observed across different populations, with the B2 phylogroup being more prevalent among cancer-associated strains, indicating higher pathogenicity\nUnderstanding the role of colibactin-producing E. coli in cancer development opens new avenues for prevention and intervention strategies, such as lifestyle modifications to improve gut health\nAdvertisement Colorectal cancer, characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the colon or rectum, presents symptoms such as persistent abdominal discomfort, changes in bowel habits and unexplained weight loss. Urinary tract cancer, including bladder and prostate cancer, manifests through painful urination, blood in urine and frequent urges to urinate. These cancers pose significant health challenges, often leading to severe complications if left untreated.\nResearch published in The Lancet Microbe 1 uncovered a link between certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce a toxin called colibactin and the increased risk of developing colorectal and urinary tract cancers.\nColibactin induces double-strand breaks in the DNA of human cells, driving tumorigenesis and contributing to the formation of cancerous growths. This discovery sheds light on how bacterial infections play a more substantial role in cancer development than previously understood.\nColibactin-Producing E. Coli Linked to Increased Cancer Risk\nThe Lancet Microbe study investigated the connection between colibactin-producing E. coli and the incidence of colorectal, bladder and prostate cancers. The research sought to determine how geographical variations in the prevalence of these bacteria correlate with cancer rates, particularly focusing on regions with high Human Development Index (HDI).\nThe study examined different populations across various countries, assessing the presence of colibactin-producing E. coli and the corresponding rates of colorectal and urinary tract cancers. It revealed that areas with a higher prevalence of these bacteria also experienced increased incidences of these cancers. This strong association suggests that the bacteria play a significant role in cancer development.\nOne of the key findings is that colibactin causes double-strand breaks in the DNA of epithelial cells. This damage is a key factor in tumorigenesis, the process by which normal cells transform into cancer cells. The study highlighted that colibactin-driven DNA damage is a plausible mechanism linking these bacteria to cancer.\nAdditionally, the research found that certain phylogroup B2 E. coli strains secrete colibactin during interbacterial competition. This secretion not only helps the bacteria survive but also increases the host’s risk of DNA damage. Such interactions within the gut microbiome create an environment conducive to cancer development.\nThe prevalence of colibactin-producing E. coli varies significantly across different regions, aligning closely with the variation in colorectal cancer rates. In high-HDI countries, the major lineages of these bacteria are frequently associated with urinary tract infections and are more commonly found within the population.\nMoreover, the study noted that the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer has risen significantly in high-HDI countries since the mid-1980s. This trend correlates with the increased prevalence of colibactin-producing E. coli, suggesting that environmental and lifestyle factors in these regions contribute to the spread and impact of these bacteria.\nThe research highlighted that other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, particularly the Klebsiella genus, also possess genes for colibactin production. These bacteria frequently colonize the human gut and are common culprits in urinary tract infections. The presence of these genes in multiple bacterial species suggests a broader impact on public health, as it increases the number of sources of colibactin exposure.\nThe study concluded that eradication of the major pks+ E. coli lineages could offer considerable public health benefits. Reducing the burden of E. coli infections, decreasing the need for antibiotics and lowering the risk of developing cancers linked to colibactin exposure are significant outcomes of such efforts. 2\nAutophagy Is the Body’s Defense Against E. Coli-Induced Cancer\nAnother study found that the body’s natural recycling system, known as autophagy, plays a role in protecting against cancer caused by harmful E. coli bacteria. Autophagy is like the cell’s own cleaning crew, removing damaged parts and keeping everything running smoothly. In this research, scientists explored how autophagy helps prevent the development of cancer in the presence of colibactin-producing E. coli (CoPEC). 3\nThe study focused on mice that were either normal or had a specific genetic modification that impaired their autophagy process in intestinal cells. By introducing CoPEC to these mice and inducing chronic inflammation, the researchers aimed to see how autophagy affects cancer formation.\nThe findings were striking: mice with impaired autophagy developed more invasive cancers compared to those with functioning autophagy systems. This shows that autophagy is essential in fighting off the cancer-promoting effects of CoPEC.\nOne of the key discoveries was that CoPEC infection leads to significant DNA damage in the cells lining the colon. DNA damage is like having cracks in the blueprint of a building; it leads to structural failures, or in this case, to cells turning cancerous.\nThe researchers observed that in mice with deficient autophagy, the extent of DNA damage was much greater. This suggests that autophagy helps to repair or remove damaged DNA, preventing the cells from becoming cancerous. 4\nMoreover, the study highlighted that autophagy not only repairs DNA but also controls the amount of harmful substances within the cells. When autophagy is functioning properly, it clears out toxins and damaged components that could otherwise contribute to cancer development. In the absence of efficient autophagy, these harmful elements accumulate, creating an environment where cancer thrives. 5\nThe researchers also discovered that chronic inflammation, which is a long-term, persistent irritation of the body’s tissues, exacerbates the cancer-promoting effects of CoPEC. Inflammation is the body’s response to harmful stimuli, but when it becomes chronic, it causes more harm than good. The study showed that in mice with chronic inflammation, the presence of CoPEC led to a higher incidence of invasive tumors.\nHowever, when autophagy was active, it mitigated some of the damage caused by both inflammation and bacterial infection, reducing the overall risk of cancer. 6 The findings suggest that enhancing autophagy could be a strategy for reducing cancer risk in environments where harmful bacteria are prevalent. 7\nWhen comparing the effects of different variables, the study found that the presence of colibactin was a critical factor in cancer development. Mice infected with CoPEC that produced colibactin showed a much higher rate of cancer than those infected with bacteria that could not produce this toxin. This indicates that colibactin is a potent agent in causing DNA damage and promoting cancer.\nAdditionally, the interaction between colibactin and the body’s autophagy system illustrates how important cellular processes are in defending against external threats. 8 Overall, this study underscores the role of autophagy in preventing cancer.\nBy understanding how autophagy interacts with harmful bacteria like CoPEC, researchers can develop better strategies to enhance this natural defense mechanism. This could lead to new treatments that boost autophagy in high-risk populations, ultimately reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer linked to bacterial infections and chronic inflammation.\nGenetic Diversity of Colibactin-Producing E. Coli\nA study published in PLOS One explored the genetic diversity of harmful E. coli bacteria that produce colibactin within different populations in Pakistan. 9 The researchers aimed to understand how these bacteria differ genetically and how these differences influence their ability to cause cancer.\nBy analyzing samples from both colorectal cancer patients and healthy individuals, the study provided valuable insights into the relationship between specific E. coli strains and cancer development.\nThe study focused on individuals from Pakistan, specifically those visiting the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) in Islamabad. By comparing the E. coli strains, the researchers identified significant differences in the types and characteristics of the bacteria.\nOne of the key findings was that a substantial portion of the E. coli isolates from cancer patients belonged to the B2 phylogroup. Phylogroups are classifications that group bacteria based on their genetic characteristics. The B2 group, in particular, was found to be more pathogenic, meaning it has a greater ability to cause disease, compared to other phylogroups. This higher pathogenicity makes the B2 group a significant concern in the context of cancer development.\nThe study revealed that 43.47% of the cancer-associated E. coli isolates were from the B2 phylogroup, whereas none of the isolates from healthy controls belonged to this group. This stark difference highlights the role of B2 phylogroup E. coli in promoting cancer. The absence of B2 phylogroup strains in healthy individuals suggests that these bacteria specifically contribute to the progression of colorectal cancer.\nIn addition to the prevalence of the B2 phylogroup, the researchers found that a remarkable 90% of the cancer-associated E. coli strains tested positive for colibactin and the polyketide synthase (pks) island. The pks island is a cluster of genes responsible for producing colibactin. None of the healthy control isolates tested positive for these colibactin genes, underscoring the strong association between colibactin-producing E. coli and colorectal cancer.\nColibactin Is a Genotoxic Compound\nThe presence of colibactin in these bacteria is particularly concerning because colibactin is a genotoxic compound. Genotoxic means it damages the genetic information within a cell, leading to mutations and causing the cell to become cancerous. In simpler terms, colibactin acts like a faulty key that disrupts the normal functioning of cells, making them more likely to turn into cancer cells.\nFurthermore, the study documented the significant cytotoxic activity of the B2 phylogroup E. coli isolates that produce colibactin. Cytotoxic activity refers to the ability of these bacteria to kill cells or damage them severely. The damage caused by these bacteria disrupts the balance of the gut microbiota, which is essential for maintaining intestinal health.\nInterestingly, this research was the first to report the prevalence of different E. coli phylogroups in cancer patients within a Pakistani population from a low socioeconomic background. This finding is important because it highlights how genetic diversity in harmful bacteria varies across different regions and populations.\nUnderstanding this diversity helps in identifying specific bacterial strains that pose the highest risk for cancer, allowing for more targeted prevention and treatment strategies.\nMicrobial dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut microbiota, is closely linked with various intestinal abnormalities, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer. The study emphasized that the presence of colibactin-producing E. coli strains disrupts the normal gut environment, leading to dysbiosis.\nThis imbalance creates conditions that favor the growth of harmful bacteria while inhibiting beneficial ones, thereby increasing the risk of cancer development.\nFurther, in vitro studies, which are experiments conducted outside of living organisms, have shown that E. coli strains with the pks island promote megalocytosis, a condition where cells and their nuclei become enlarged without undergoing proper cell division.\nAdditionally, these bacteria induce DNA double-strand breaks and encourage G2 cell cycle arrest, where cells are halted before they divide. These effects collectively contribute to the development and progression of cancer by allowing damaged cells to survive and proliferate uncontrollably.\nOverall, the genetic diversity of colibactin-producing E. coli and their strong association with the B2 phylogroup highlight the significant role these bacteria play in colorectal cancer development. This study provides a foundation for further research into the microbial factors involved in cancer and underscores the importance of addressing bacterial diversity in the fight against colorectal cancer. 10\nPractical Steps to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Risk\nWith E. coli bacteria linked to cancer development, it’s important to take steps to safeguard your health. Research indicates that specific strains of E. coli, especially those producing colibactin toxins, elevate cancer risk by causing DNA damage. Maintaining a stable microbial balance enhances cellular health for chronic disease prevention. Below are the top approaches to improve your gut health and decrease cancer risk.\nEliminate processed foods and seed oils — The contemporary diet is laden with processed foods that contain seed oils rich in linoleic acid (LA), which harms your gut microbiome and encourages the proliferation of harmful bacteria.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nLA acts as a mitochondrial toxin, disrupting cellular energy production and hindering your ability to sustain a healthy gut environment. In addition to removing processed foods, avoid nuts and seeds to further lower LA intake. It’s also advisable to minimize eating out, as most restaurants use seed oils in their cooking, sauces and dressings.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nFurthermore, reduce your consumption of chicken and pork, which are typically high in LA. Replace processed foods with whole, natural foods and healthy fats such as grass fed butter, tallow and ghee. Aim to keep your total LA intake below 5 grams from all sources, ideally under 2 grams. To monitor your LA consumption, record all your daily meals using an online nutrition tracker.\nOptimize your carbohydrate consumption — Another key factor is the careful management of your carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrates are essential for supporting mitochondrial function since glucose is the primary fuel for cellular energy production. Adjust your carbohydrate intake to promote a healthy microbiome by consuming 200 to 350 grams of specific carbohydrates each day for most adults.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nIndividuals with higher activity levels may require more. Introduce carbohydrates gradually to allow your gut time to adapt, thereby minimizing digestive issues and endotoxin levels. Start with white rice and whole fruits to nourish beneficial bacteria before incorporating vegetables, whole grains and starches. Initially avoiding high-fiber diets is important if your gut microbiome is compromised, as excessive fiber elevates endotoxin levels in this case.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nIf your gut health is significantly impaired, focus on easily digestible carbohydrates like dextrose water for the first week or two. Slowly sip it throughout the day to support gradual healing of your gut.\nMinimize exposure to environmental toxins — Exposure to synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), estrogens and widespread electromagnetic fields (EMFs) further weakens your cells' ability to produce energy efficiently. This energy shortfall makes it challenging to maintain the oxygen-free gut environment necessary for beneficial bacteria like Akkermansia to thrive.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nAdditionally, inadequate cellular energy creates a gut environment that favors endotoxin-producing bacteria, which damage mitochondria and perpetuate a cycle of declining health. By reducing excess LA, estrogens (including xenoestrogens found in everyday products like plastics), EDCs and EMFs, you restore cellular energy and move toward optimal health.\nLimit antibiotic use and consider Akkermansia — Antibiotics severely damage beneficial gut bacteria and significantly increase the risk of colon cancer. Use antibiotics only when absolutely necessary and focus on rebuilding your gut flora with targeted dietary choices, including fermented foods, afterward.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nAdditionally, avoid conventionally raised meats that often contain antibiotic residues by selecting high-quality, responsibly sourced proteins to support a healthy microbiome.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nAkkermansia is vital for a healthy microbiome, but many individuals have little to none. It is important to eliminate all seed oils from your diet for at least six months before starting an Akkermansia supplementation program.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThis preparation period allows your body to restore mitochondrial function and create a more supportive environment in your colon for beneficial bacteria. By following these steps, you maximize the benefits of Akkermansia supplementation and support overall gut health.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nWhen selecting Akkermansia supplements, choose those that utilize advanced, timed-release capsules or microencapsulation technology. These methods keep the bacteria dormant and protected until they reach your colon, typically within two to four hours after ingestion, ensuring that a higher number of live bacteria survive the journey through your digestive system.\nNEXT ARTICLE >>\nDisclaimer : The entire contents of this website are based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola, unless otherwise noted.

Foto: Bruno Sousa / Atlético Palmeiras empata com o Cruzeiro em 1 a 1 e é campeão brasileiro Em despedida de Fábio Santos, Inter bate Corinthians por 2 a 1 Com a contratação de Scarpa, o jogador se tornou a 4ª contratação mais cara da história do Clube. Além disso, o Galo não deve parar somente no jogador em relação a contratações.\nAlém disso, o time mineiro busca definir a situação dos jogadores que estão dentro do seu staff. É o caso de Isaac, jogador estrela do sub-20 do Galo, anteriormente ele foi observado por Felipão.\nO atleta foi artilheiro do time júnior do Galo em 2023, foram 19 gols em 23 jogos disputados. Ele chegou a ser utilizado no time principal do Atlético com Eduardo Coudet. Isaac é muito bem visto pela diretoria atleticana.\nSavinho aconselha Isaac A diretoria Galo encontra dificuldades para renovar com Isaac, as negociações se arrastam por vários meses, o atual vínculo dele com o Galo é valido somente até abril de 2024.\nRodrigo Caetano falou sobre a relação do jogador: “Em relação ao Isaac, renovamos com quase todos os meninos da base. E conversamos com o empresário dele já faz quase um ano. E seguimos conversando. Se nós renovarmos, todos saberão. Se não, foi por opção dele. E o Galo segue. Assim como no meu caso, de outros. O Galo é maior que todos”, afirmou o diretor de futebol do Atlético.\nO Galo deve renovar com o Isaac?

    "text": "“Repsol. Felicidades! Eres un ganador de un iPad Pro. Ha sido seleccionado como uno de los pocos afortunados para tener una oportunidad única de ganar un iPad Pro” (sic). Si has recibido un correo electrónico como este, supuestamente enviado por la empresa energética española, elimínalo cuanto antes de tu bandeja de entrada. Se trata de un nuevo caso de phishing en el que los ciberdelincuentes han suplantado a la compañía. Su objetivo: hacerse con los datos personales y bancarios de las potenciales víctimas.\nDe hecho, desde INFOVERITAS ya alertamos de un intento de fraude similar. Los ciberdelincuentes suplantaron a Repsol, con otro gancho pero con el mismo premio, para estafar a los incautos. Además, el phishing no es el único modus operandi con el que la compañía ha sufrido ataques. Antonio Bufrau, su presidente, fue también suplantado, en una supuesta entrevista en El Mundo, para promocionar “oportunidades de inversión”.\nCuidado si recibes un correo de Repsol en el que te regalan un iPad Pro a cambio de contestar una encuesta, es phishing\nLa primera pista que debe hacer saltar las alarmas de intento de estafa de los usuarios es que Repsol es una empresa energética. Es decir, no comercializa ningún tipo de producto tangible, como, en este caso, un iPad Pro.\nEn segundo lugar, que el cuerpo del mensaje redirige a una web cuya URL https://thermalmidships.fun/?encoded_value=223GDT1&sub1=1d9fcb89068242a7b93ffdf4896a83ec&sub2=&sub3=&sub4=&sub5=17769&source_id=20121&ip=83.38.65.255&domain=www.backtonextpage.com no guarda relación con la oficial de Carrefour: https://www.repsol.com/es/index.cshtml.\nDicha web deriva a la supuesta encuesta, pero antes se puede leer el siguiente mensaje: “Estimado comprador de Repsol, Nos gustaría ofrecerle una oportunidad única de recibir un iPad Pro! Para reclamar, simplemente responde esta breve encuesta sobre tu experiencia con Repsol. Atención! Esta oferta de encuesta vence hoy, Agosto 28, 2024” (sic). Esta es otra pista de que se trata de un caso de phishing, ya que, como aclaran desde el Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad (INCIBE), el apremio a los usuarios para que realicen una acción y los errores ortográficos y gramaticales son indicativos de estafa.\nTras completar la encuesta, que consta de diez preguntas, la web fraudulenta redirige a otra pantalla en la que se insta a las potenciales víctimas a reclamar su premio. Tras esto, una nueva web emerge para que los usuarios introduzcan sus datos personales. Por otro lado, ahora el precio iPad Pro ha cambiado a 2 euros, ya no es gratuito, como anunciaban en la página anterior.",

    "text": "Panthers signing standout player from UFL\nThe Carolina Panthers are dipping into an unconventional pool of talent.\nIan Rapoport of NFL Network\nreported Thursday that the Panthers are expected to sign wide receiver Daewood Davis, pending a physical. Davis spent time earlier this year in the UFL with the Memphis Showboats.\nThe 25-year-old Davis went undrafted in 2023 following stints at both Oregon and Western Kentucky in college. He signed with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent but was waived months later after\nsuffering a scary injury during a preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars that caused the game to be suspended.\nFortunately for Davis, he was able to bounce back in the UFL this year, logging 446 receiving yards and five touchdowns for the Showboats during their ten regular season games. That was good enough to earn Davis All-UFL team honors.\nThe Panthers\ndid add a new No. 1 receiver this offseason and also drafted wideout Xavier Legette with their first-round pick in this year’s draft (No. 32 overall). But now Davis will give them more depth as well as some big-play upside at the position.",
