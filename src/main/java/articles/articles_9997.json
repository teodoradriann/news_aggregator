    "text": "Nicaragua arrests two high-ranking Catholic priests with close ties to cardinal Many of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes. Nicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 10:42 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 10:29 IST Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week. The source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega. Local media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released. The government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Over the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes. Aviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer. Alvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year. Last week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022. Many of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes. Nicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released. \"I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!\" wrote in a post on X on Thursday. According to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.

    "text": "AURORA, Colo. (CITC) — Parents in a Colorado elementary school are demanding accountability after a registered sex offender allegedly tried to kidnap a child on school grounds. 33-year-old Solomon Galligan was arrested Friday after walking up to multiple students at Black Forest Hills Elementary School. Galligan, a registered sex offender, is accused of attempting to grab a young boy before fleeing school grounds. Staff were alerted to the confrontation once some students began yelling \"stranger danger,\" according to the Cherry Creek School District. Galligan was later caught by police and charged with one count of attempted kidnapping. In a statement Monday, the Cherry Creek School District said it was \"committed to being transparent and accountable to our community\" as it investigated the matter. However, Black Forest Hills parents say Friday's incident has left them \"deeply disturbed\" and questioning the school district's ability to \"ensure our children's safety.\" In a petition started Wednesday, parents are demanding a \"comprehensive review\" of Cherry Creek's response to the incident, as well as of all employees involved. READ MORE | Registered sex offender tried to kidnap child from Colorado elementary school, police say Specific attention should be paid to those who failed to advise the establishment of a secure perimeter or to initiate other critical safety protocols,\" the petition reads. \"This measure is crucial not only to ensure the integrity of the investigation but also to restore confidence in the leadership among parents and students.\" Signees of the petition are also requesting Cherry Creek initiate immediate and recurring audits of the district's security measures, with the results being shared with the community. The petition has received more than 115 signatures as of Thursday afternoon. My daughter was there and she deserves an explanation on why her and her friends' lives were put in danger and the people who are to protect them failed,\" signee Katherine Wilcoxen wrote. One parent who spoke with The Denver Post alleged police were not notified of the incident for nearly an hour, while families were not alerted for an additional 20 minutes. Nicole Jass reportedly also claimed students were not immediately brought inside after the incident occurred. In a letter sent to families Thursday and shared with Crisis in the Classroom (CITC), Black Forest Hills principal Amanda Replogle acknowledged \"the one clear misstep\" the school made last week \"was that the school should have gone into a Secure Status.\" Such a status requires all students be brought inside while security investigates a matter, according to the district. \"I recognize that this has been a traumatic experience for our community. I take the rebuilding of trust with you seriously,\" Replogle wrote. \"This will show up in changes and consistent action from me and my dedicated staff.\" Have something for the Crisis in the Classroom team to investigate?

Na rede social, Marçal afirmou que não acha justo o debate acontecer sem Marina Helena.\nCarol Sponza respondeu à publicação, criticando os candidatos do Rio que participarão do debate e não se pronunciaram quanto à sua exclusão. São eles o prefeito Eduardo Paes (PSD), os deputados federais Alexandre Ramagem (PL), Tarcísio Motta (PSOL) e Marcelo Queiroz (PP). O deputado estadual Rodrigo Amorim (União Brasil) também defendeu sua participação.\n“Estamos diante de uma tentativa clara de silenciar vozes que representam uma nova forma de fazer política. A decisão da justiça não muda o nosso compromisso com a mudança e com a construção de um futuro melhor para o Rio. Continuaremos a lutar por uma verdadeira renovação e por mais diversidade no debate público”, disse Sponza à coluna.\nFoi somente após a reclamação que Ramagem publicou na rede em favor de Carol, dizendo que ela está correta e que, “se queremos ter um debate democrático, você tem que estar presente também”. Ao passo que a deputada agradeceu a resposta e o chamou de “Homem, com H maiúsculo” que ganhou seu respeito.\nTanto Sponza quanto Marina Helena são filiadas ao Novo, que passou a contar, pelo retorno do deputado federal Ricardo Salles no dia 2 de agosto, com a representação mínima de candidatos exigida para garantir a presença nos debates eleitorais. A regra eleitoral prevê que as emissoras só são obrigadas a convidar candidatos dos partidos que possuem um mínimo de cinco cadeiras no Congresso Nacional, algo que o Novo não tinha até então.\nCarol Sponza entrou com um pedido de liminar na Justiça Eleitoral para que pudesse participar do debate, porém o pedido foi indeferido nesta quarta-feira (7/08). Já Maria Helena chegou a conseguir a liminar na noite de segunda-feira (5/08), mas a decisão foi derrubada a pedido da Band.\nReceba o conteúdo da coluna no seu",

    "text": "Finally, a major surge of moisture will push into California this week, dropping 6-18″ with localized high-elevation zones seeing as much as 2 feet of snow. The storm will last from Tuesday evening until Wednesday morning, with lingering snowfall into Wednesday night. The snow level will be below resort bases for the entire duration of the storm.\nThe most favorable area for snowfall will be the west Lake Tahoe basin along the Sierra Crest, where resorts will pick up 10-18″, favoring resorts further south (Kirkwood & Palisades). For other resorts in Tahoe, Northstar should pick up 4-8″ and Mt. Rose & Heavenly should see 2-5″.\nMammoth will see less precipitation, but should still see around a foot of fresh snow at mid-mountain. Higher elevation and thus lower temperatures will bring higher quality snow to Mammoth, so conditions should be excellent there on Wednesday.\nSnowfall will linger in the region during the day on Wednesday and should be wrapped up by Wednesday night.\nLooking ahead, the next opportunity for decent snowfall comes this weekend, with a storm that looks smaller than this week’s storm but should still bring some decent snowfall. Fingers crossed for an active pattern heading into the rest of the season!",

    "title": "120 anos depois, dois velhos rivais da Europa voltam a celebrar uma aliança, agora para apoiar a Ucrânia – Executive Digest",
    "text": "Cento e vinte anos depois da ‘Entente Cordiale’, Grã-Bretanha e França estão a forjar uma nova aliança. Se o acordo original de 1904 abriu caminho a uma relação mais forte entre os dois países, a nova união pretende ‘remendar’ o compromisso europeu com a Ucrânia e exercer pressão sobre os Estados Unidos.\nNuma missiva recente ao jornal britânico ‘The Telegraph’, o secretário dos Negócios Estrangeiros britânico, Lord Cameron, e o seu homólogo francês, Stéphane Séjourné, ministro da Europa e dos Negócios Estrangeiros, destacaram tanto o “compromisso duradouro com a nossa amizade” como o seu sucesso em terem, juntos, “ajudado a forjar um mundo melhor”.\nNo entanto, apontou a publicação ‘The Conversation’, as apostas são agora mais altas do que há 120 anos. A guerra continua a assolar a Ucrânia. O compromisso financeiro do Congresso dos EUA continua falível, ao mesmo tempo que a resposta da Europa mantém-se frágil, com divisões e desunião a ameaçar tanto a UE como as respostas transatlânticas.\nPoderá a aliança anglo-francesa inspirar novos compromissos? É essa a convicção, primeiro exigindo um compromisso reforçado dos aliados europeus e dos EUA, e segundo, pressionando mais fortemente por melhores estruturas de segurança europeias.\nDesde a invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia, em fevereiro de 2022, os dois países têm sido indiscutivelmente os maiores defensores do envio de material para Kiev defender o seu território – esse apoio estendeu-se ao fornecimento de armas letais, ajuda, formação e financiamento, apoiados pelo compromisso diplomático.\nO Reino Unido, por exemplo, tem sido responsável por dois projetos substanciais para fornecer assistência militar à Ucrânia desde a invasão da Crimeia em 2014. A Operação Interflex envolveu o treino intensivo de 22 mil soldados das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, trazendo as suas competências de infantaria e médicas para os padrões da NATO.\nO Reino Unido também trabalhou ao lado de nove outros parceiros internacionais, permitindo que mais de 17 mil recrutas ucranianos concluíssem um curso de formação de cinco semanas em solo britânico, estabelecendo ao mesmo tempo um esforço internacional mais amplo para treinar mais 67 mil soldados ucranianos em mais de 30 países.\nJuntos, Reino Unido e França pressionaram a UE – a Alemanha em particular – a assumir compromissos inovadores de ajuda militar. Ao fazê-lo, Londres tornou-se um pioneiro estratégico no fornecimento de sistemas de armas cada vez mais sofisticados a Kiev, incluindo os principais tanques de batalha Challenger 2, anunciados em janeiro de 2023, motivando a Alemanha a enviar tanques Leopard 2 menos de duas semanas depois.\nO apoio do Reino Unido e dos Países Baixos desencadeou recentemente a construção de uma nova coligação aérea internacional, que inclui os EUA, para adquirir caças F-16 para a Ucrânia, em primeiro lugar, e a longo prazo, permitir uma melhor coordenação com os aliados da NATO.\nEmbora a Grã-Bretanha e a França tenham apoiado a Ucrânia com equipamento de ponta, a questão é saber se o seu próprio compromisso é suficientemente influente para atrair outros a imitá-los. Há exemplos decentes aqui: com os mísseis Storm Shadow, Londres colocou uma pressão significativa sobre os EUA para aumentarem as suas próprias doações de Sistemas de Mísseis Táticos do Exército, e pressionou a Alemanha a enviar mísseis de cruzeiro Taurus.\nMas também existem lacunas preocupantes. Os atrasos nos EUA na aprovação do pacote de ajuda externa de 60 mil milhões de dólares à Ucrânia fazem parte da ansiedade constante de que os EUA possam simplesmente optar por reduzir os seus compromissos e, em última análise, retirar o seu apoio à Europa como um todo, numa possível segunda Administração Trump.\nA Grã-Bretanha e França poderiam capitalizar a sua liderança para coordenar o esforço de guerra em termos de defesa e diplomacia, mantendo os aliados na luta, agora e a médio prazo. Isto inclui tudo, desde o fornecimento imediato de armas à própria Ucrânia, até à garantia de que as missões de treino do Reino Unido e da UE para as Forças Armadas ucranianas trabalham em conjunto.\nA longo prazo, as garantias de segurança globais que o Reino Unido, França e a UE podem fornecer à Ucrânia, juntamente com os EUA, ditarão a transição da guerra para o cessar-fogo. Fazer isso poderia reforçar o aspeto transatlântico do conflito, no que diz respeito ao compromisso dos EUA, mas serviria para estimular tanto a UE como a NATO a apoiar iniciativas de defesa mais explícitas.",

    "text": "Berezina is known to many as the author of \"Viktoria's Letters\" – a public war diary for Estonians, written in correspondence with Tartu gallerist Raul Oreškin during the first months of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those letters have now been published as a book, \"My Kherson. Letters from Ukraine\" (\"Minu Herson: Kirjad Ukrainast\"),\nThe exhibition \"I am in nature. Nature is in me,\" has been created by Berezina while living in Estonia. The works of art on display recreate the human journey to the sources of nature's power.\n\"War devastates not only people's material world, but also their inner world. The chaos caused by war undermines the very foundation of being – beliefs and perceptions about ourselves and the world we live in, leaving gaps in our minds and a sickening emptiness in our souls,\" said Viktoria Berezina, at the exhibition's opening.\n\"I've often wondered, what can fill the emptiness of my soul? Only something bigger and deeper. For me, it is nature. Nature has become a source of hope and inspiration for me, healing the wounded soul and bringing it back to life, just as nature awakens after a long winter sleep,\" she added.\nViktoria Berezina was born in 1994 in Kherson, Ukraine. She is a freelance artist and graphic designer, as well co-founder and organizer of the art festival \"Mycelium.\"\nBerezina's exhibition \"I am in Nature: Nature is in me\" is open at Taru's Haki Gallery until February 23.\n--\nFollow ERR News on Facebook and Twitter and never miss an update!\nEditor: Michael Cole\nart tartu kherson viktoria berezina haki gallery",

    "text": "[HackerRuso](/user/HackerRuso)a [ambito.com](/go/link/3916814) [#93](c93#c-93) >\nPorque el que dispara no tiene más remedio que disparar y matarlos.\nLos argumentos sionistas son escoria humana.\n[#72](c72#c-72) Sonaría aberrante porque hay infinitos casos de palestinos alzando la bandera blanca y siendo acribillados igualmente por el ejército israelí.\nMás que aberrante, suena estúpido comparar una guerra con un genocidio en donde el pueblo masacrado no puede hacer absolutamente nada para parar la agresión.\n[#12](c12#c-12) ¿Realista que Rusia se vaya a cambio de nada, después del coste humano y económico que ha sufrido en la guerra? Que mañana baje Dios y pare la guerra con sus poderes es más realista que eso que propones.\n[#5](c5#c-5) No está pidiendo la paz. Está pidiendo la rendición del agredido, en lugar de la retirada del agresor.\nEso de pacífico no tiene una mierda.\n-----\nIgual que todos los que veo por aquí graznando que la rendición es lo lógico porque Ucrania no tiene posibilidad de defenderse. Si tirásemos al río a todos los burros que corren por aquí, más de un pantano desbordaría.\nSiguiendo esa lógica subnormal, cada vez que a un país le dé por invadir a otro por las bravas, tan sólo hay que evaluar si tiene capacidad de matar más gente que el otro. Y el país invadido que se joda. Muy pacífico todo, claro que sí.\nPara que os enteréis, Putin perdió esta invasión el día 1, porque evidentemente intentaba repetir en los oblast de Donbass la ocupación relámpago de Crimea. Le salió como el culo, de hecho no le salió en absoluto, y como apostó su prestigio político al resultado ha montado una guerra para no reconocer su fracaso.\nNi de coña es Ucrania la que debe rendirse. Si China deja de alimentar al hijo tonto, en dos meses los rusos empezarán a pasar hambre y veremos rodar la cabeza de Putin y el fin de esta invasión al día siguiente.\n[#76](c76#c-76) Las hostilidades cesaron en marzo de 1940 con la firma del Tratado de Paz de Moscú. Finlandia cedió el 11 % de su territorio que representa el 30 % de su economía a la Unión Soviética\n[#60](c60#c-60) Los ucranianos se rindieron hace dos años.\nOtra cosa es el que nazi hijo de la gran puta de su presidente y los países corruptos que le ceban de armas para que siga masacrando a su población y así pueda lucrarse el hijo de puta de Biden y todos los hijos de puta que tienen acciones en la industria armamentística que se están forrando en EEUU, así como todos los hijos de la gran puta que dirigen Europa, desde la puta psicópata Bonder Leyen al hijo de la gran puta de Pedro mierda, pasando por la manga de hijos de puta corruptos que están sentados en el parlamento europeo, que siguen animando al pueblo ucraniano a defender su honor y toda esa basura de discurso.\nEl pueblo ucraniano se caga en la puta madre de toda está escoria que se está forrando a costa de sus vidas\nEllos se han rendido hace mucho. Pero no les dejan irse a su casa.\n[#15](c15#c-15) En esos argumentos hay muchísimo de propaganda rusa. Antes de la llegada de los hombrecitos verdes en 2014 al Dombas, está era una zona tranquila sin mayores ansias independentistas de las que pudiera tener el país vasco.\nEl problema es que de repente apareció todo un ejército en estas regiones totalmente agresivo y expansionista. Solo hay que ver el avión de pasajeros derribado con armamento especializado.\nPor poner un caso 100% documentado: el tribunal holandés que juzgo el asesinato de los 300 pasajeros determinó que de los 4 responsables directos, 3 fueron oficiales rusos y solo un ucraniano independentista. Y que el lanzamisiles es propiedad ruso, y fue trasladado inmediatamente a Moscú tras el atentado.\nYo no sé cómo hay gente que se traga la propaganda habiendo tanta información contrastada. Y no sólo eso; a estas alturas este proceder de acudir en \"auxilio\" de las minorías rusas, meter mercenarios o soldados encubiertos, tomar la zona responsabilizando a los independentistas, ya se había repetido en Georgia o Moldavia anteriormente.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No, no es como si España entrara en guerra con USA. Es como si USA invadiera España para robarla.\nY por lo visto tú abogarías por regalarle al invasor todas las regiones industrializadas y toda la costa turística del país (que son los territorios que ha tomado Rusia en Ucrania). Como si eso no supusiera directamente la muerte de tu país.\nPor cierto, ¿en qué cabeza seca ”que muera gente” es responsabilidad del invadido y no del invasor?\n[#71](c71#c-71) ”sin intentar engañar a los demás con las causas del conflicto”.\n¿Estás insinuando que Ucrania es responsable de que Rusia pretenda robarle los tres oblast que son con diferencia la mayor fuente de riqueza del país?\n¿Te has preguntado por qué Rusia no va a por las capitales (Kiev u Odessa)? ¿Por qué invade solamente las regiones que generan más dinero y se la suda todo el resto de Ucrania, que es rural?\nEl único engañado con las causas del conflicto eres tú, que no ves que esto es un atraco y nada más. Es el robo descarado de las fuentes de riqueza de un país, a manos de un matón extranjero. Ucrania no puede rendirse si no quiere morir de hambruna al día siguiente.\n[#99](c99#c-99) ¿Por qué occidente debería involucrarse en Israel? Yo considero que ninguno de los 2 bandos merece ser apoyado.\n[#104](c104#c-104) Porque se está cometiendo un genocidio y bombardeando a la población civil con armas occidentales. Porque va contra la convención d Ginebra y los DDHH. Porque es terrorismo de Estado. Porque son nuestros aliados y amigos, y hasta los invitamos a nuestros festivales de la canción y comerciamos con ellos. Porque nosotros creamos el Estado de Israel, una colonia europea supremacista blanca. Porque han asesinado a 10.000 niños. Porque han atacado la sede de la UNRWA y destruido la práctica totalidad de los hospitales. Porque han bombardeado campos de refugiados. Porque están bloqueando la ayuda humanitaria. Porque no reconocen a Palestina, pero tienen a los palestinos en una cárcel a cielo abierto. Y por muchas más razones.\n[#108](c108#c-108) Si los palestinos entregaran a los civiles secuestrados ok a todo lo que dices, mientras no lo hagan no tomo parte.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Que desnortados estáis algunos. En Ucrania hay un gobierno nazi, y ni siquiera ocultan serlo homenajeando a nazis. Putin será lo que quieras, pero fascista desde luego que no. A ver si sabemos reconocer las ideologías, que basta haber ido a la escuela primaria.\n[#46](c46#c-46) Ucrania no tiene barcos de guerra porque estaban en Sebastopol cuando Rusia invadió Crimea en 2014.\nUn poco tramposo tu comentario. No han perdido la flota en esta guerra, les fue robada por sorpresa seis años antes. Justamente por fiarse de Rusia y alquilarles la base de Sebastopol.\nY tampoco es que la fuerza naval pinte mucho en la invasión de Ucrania, que digamos.",
