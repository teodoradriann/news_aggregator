    "text": "Texas Legislature 2025\nTexas bill increasing public school funding and teacher pay gets initial House approval\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe Texas House on Wednesday gave initial approval to its priority school funding legislation. In a 144-4 vote, the lower chamber preliminary approved a bill that would increase school districts’ base money per student, raise teacher salaries and limit the use of educators without formal classroom training. House Bill 2 would also improve special education by allocating funding based on the individual needs of children with disabilities.\nRepublicans, during hours of debate, celebrated the bill as a worthwhile $8 billion investment in public education. Democrats also voiced support for the legislation but argued that it barely scratches the surface of what districts need. Many school districts are currently grappling with challenges ranging from budget deficits and teacher shortages to campus closures.\nThe bill would notably increase schools’ base funding by $395 — from $6,160 to $6,555. That amount, known as the basic allotment, would automatically go up every two years by tying it to property value growth. Forty-percent of the allotment would go to salaries for school staff. Higher salary increases would go to teachers with more than a decade of classroom experience.\nLawmakers sparred over other aspects of the legislation — from whether the Legislature should continue to invest heavily in compensatory education, which offers support to underserved students at risk of dropping out of school, to how the state should hold charter schools accountable for mismanagement.\nUpon final passage, HB 2 will go to the Senate for further consideration. That chamber has already passed a number of similar school funding proposals — though top lawmakers there have expressed opposition to increasing schools' base funding this session.\nThe basic allotment offers districts flexibility to address the unique needs of their campuses, which includes staff salaries, utilities and maintenance. The Senate has instead advocated for more targeted funding in areas like teacher pay, school security and special education.\nThe House voted on the bill shortly before taking up legislation that would create school vouchers in Texas, a top priority for Gov. Greg Abbott. Two years ago, public schools missed out on nearly $8 billion, which Abbott held hostage when vouchers failed to gain the support needed to pass then.\nsent weekday mornings.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy and\nTerms of Service apply.\nTickets are on sale now for the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival, Texas’ breakout ideas and politics event happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin.

    "text": "Barry Boyd can fly through the air, scale vertical surfaces and perform dozens of other feats that would leave most mere mortals stunned.\nBoyd isn’t a superhero, however—he’s a ninja.\nAfter earning the chance to test his skills on the hit reality game show American Ninja Warrior (ANW)—or simply “Ninja,” as Boyd and his fellow competitors call it—Boyd, 28, has spent the past several years climbing the ranks and wowing audiences with his ability to take on an ever-evolving array of challenges designed to push athletes to their limits.\nSumming up the experience, even to fans of the show, can be tough.\n“It’s so unique, and requires such a different set of skills,” says Boyd, who likes to describe Ninja as a blend of many different sports. Sports like rock climbing are especially helpful for grip control, he explained, but oftentimes success in Ninja simply comes down to “how well you can control your body.”\nThat level of body control is what allows ANW athletes to conquer challenges that look physically impossible. In the Spider Wall Jump, for example, competitors must jump off a mini-trampoline, wedge themselves between two parallel walls using their hands and feet, and navigate the space between the walls. In the Bridge of Blades, they must run across four perpendicular panels that rotate simultaneously when stepped on.\nCompeting on ANW obviously requires tremendous physical strength and agility. What some people might not realize, Boyd says, is the extent to which the athletes must rely on mental toughness.\n“Almost the entire thing comes down to the mental part,” says Boyd. “Are you willing to keep going?”\nFor Boyd, who recently moved from Powhatan to North Chesterfield, that mental fortitude was developed long before he ever set foot in a Nina gym.\nGrowing up in Pennsylvania, Boyd and several of his siblings spent time in the foster care system, an experience Boyd says continues to shape his outlook to this day. Because of his experience, Boyd says, he hopes he and his wife Mercedes, who he met at a Bible study when both attended California University Pennsylvania, can someday become foster parents.\nFor now, the stay-at-home dad to two young sons is remaining focused on training and on his family, both the one at home and the one he has found through ANW.\n“The Ninja community really holds each other up,” says Boyd. “We’re a family, just constantly motivating each other.”\nAs for his advice to others who might find themselves watching American Ninja Warrior and wondering if they can compete, Boyd says his best advice is to just go for it.\n“There is no one perfect way,” Boyd says. “And there is no such thing as ‘you can’t do it.”\nAmerican Ninja Warrior, now in its seventeenth season, airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.",

    "title": "Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists | The Mail",
    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
