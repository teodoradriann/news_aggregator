    "text": "Savannah High School boys building a brotherhood beyond basketball SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - The Bluejackets’ (9-4) final game of 2023 didn’t end way they hoped, and they picked up their fourth loss of the season. Now as they prepare for their first game of 2024, it’s time for them to practice what they preach: It’s not about what happens to you in life, it’s about how you respond. “We try to tell them, eventually you’re going to be the leader of a household, so we try to portray and put them leadership skills in them,” said head coach George Brown. “And we hold them accountable for their actions, just like life is going to do. Life is going to get tough. Life is going to get hard.” Over the past few seasons, the team seems to be responding to hard situations as well as any coach can hope for. In Brown’s first season as an assistant coach, the team went 1-17. Then, when the current group of juniors were freshmen, they went 8-15. Last year, they were 21-8. That season ended in a Sweet Sixteen appearance in the state playoffs, and every loss for the past two years, has been to a ranked opponent. But the success on the court starts off of it. “We’re like best friends. Really when we get on the court, we’re just putting it together. We just like to play for each other,” said junior guard Maki Joyner. “You don’t really get that often where you have a lot of kids coming in where they’re already close friends, but we’ve built a relationship over the years – mainly 9th and 8th grade – we just built that relationship, so now they’re just used to everything that we do and used to what I’m trying to instill in these guys.” Whether it’s been the first-year head coach or Coach Tim Jordan, who held the reigns at Savannah High for 40 years prior to this season, both have been monumental in the growth of this team. “It’s been awesome,” said Joyner. “I never knew I was going to grow up and be big like this because I was weak in middle school. I was trash before I got here and met Coach Brown and Coach J. They really helped me with my game a lot – all of us, really.” Now, at about the halfway point of the season, it’s state championship or bust for the Bluejackets. “Like I told our kids, it’s time,” said Brown. “This is what you guys told me that you wanted, this is what you guys want to do. So everything that I’m trying to instill in them is to help them be champions.” Copyright 2024 WTOC. All rights reserved.",

The ship left John’s Pass just after 7 p.m. Tuesday and became stuck after its captain missed a turn, according to the cruise line. All the passengers on board received a full refund. TREASURE ISLAND, Fla. - Nearly 100 left John’s Pass onboard a dinner cruise Tuesday night and ended up stranded on the water until after midnight. Dig deeper: The \"Calypso Breeze,\" a 65-foot ship, part of StarLite Cruises’ fleet, was left stranded on the north side of the Treasure Island Causeway at low tide, according to Treasure Island officials. Of the 91 people on board, only 10 were crew members, according to StarLite Cruises COO Charlie Ward. Timeline: Ward says the boat sailed off at 7 p.m. and was slated to be on the water for about two hours. About an hour and a half into the voyage, however, it bottomed out because its captain missed a turn, according to Ward. Water levels didn't become high enough to sail back to the dock until around 12:25 a.m. READ: Jannus Live owner steps down after Clearwater Ferry crash leaves 1 dead, 10 injured The boat returned to the dock safely once the tides rose, without needing law enforcement's help. All the passengers on board were given a full refund. The Coast Guard and the boat’s diver found no damage to the boat when it finally redocked. Passenger Reaction: Ward says some passengers were upset by the decision to close the bar around 9 p.m., but they were following a Coast Guard recommendation to make sure passengers remained sober enough for a potential boat-to-boat transfer. Despite debating a boat transfer, the call was made to wait for water levels to rise.

    "title": "7 Mind-Blowing Innovations Transforming Law Enforcement",
    "text": "Welcome to the world of law enforcement, where innovation and technology are constantly transforming how officers serve and protect their communities. Law enforcement agencies have embraced new advancements to enhance their capabilities and better respond to evolving challenges. From cutting-edge gadgets to groundbreaking strategies, these efforts aim to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement in the modern landscape. In this article, we’ll explore seven groundbreaking innovations shaping law enforcement’s future. Prepare to be impressed by these revolutionary developments and their impact on traditional crime prevention, investigation, and overall police work. Whether you’re a curious citizen or a law enforcement professional, this piece will capture your interest. We will explore the exciting ways modern technology transforms the pursuit of justice. How technology is redefining the way law enforcement operates. Advancements in technology have revolutionized the way law enforcement operates. By integrating artificial intelligence and data analytics, officers can obtain valuable insights and actionable intelligence, leading to more informed decisions. Drones equipped with high-definition cameras and GPS tracking are also being used to enhance security and visibility in high-risk areas. Law enforcement agencies are also utilizing social media to communicate with citizens, share information, and gather [intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2023/07/20/forbes-daily-artificial-intelligence-and-what-you-need-to-know/?sh=7183a731ba31). With technological developments, the challenges faced by law enforcement are diminishing. Though there are valid concerns about privacy and surveillance, technology offers endless possibilities that can positively impact society. Predictive Policing – Using data and analytics to anticipate and prevent crime. With advances in technology, predictive policing has become a reality. By analyzing data and using algorithms, law enforcement can anticipate and prevent crime before it happens. This modern approach to law enforcement has shown promising results in reducing crime rates and improving public safety in many cities worldwide. The system is based on information such as criminal records, social media posts, and geographical patterns of criminal activity. This enables police to identify high-risk areas and individuals and take preventative measures. Predictive policing has helped law enforcement focus their resources and efforts where needed. This makes it a valuable tool in the fight against crime. Body-Worn Cameras – Enhancing transparency and accountability. There has been a growing emphasis on accountability in law enforcement in recent years. Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have quickly become a critical tool for enhancing transparency and accountability in police activities. They also play a role in interactions with community members and criminal justice processes. As more and more police departments across the globe implement this technology, they are discovering unexpected benefits. BWCs have been found to affect law enforcement and the public positively. They create opportunities to promote mutual trust, improved interactions, and transparency by documenting officers’ actions during police encounters. With BWCs, law enforcement agencies can monitor officer behavior, pinpoint and correct any shortcomings, and gain valuable insights that help fine-tune officer training programs. Facial Recognition Technology – Aiding in identification and investigations. Facial recognition technology has become an essential tool in solving crimes and identifying suspects. The ability of law enforcement agencies to quickly match a face to a name or to locate a person of interest has revolutionized the way we investigate crimes. With this technology, investigators can search through databases of millions of images to find a match, making identification much faster and easier. Not only does this save law enforcement valuable time, but it also helps to close cases more efficiently. Furthermore, businesses are also starting to integrate facial recognition technology into their security systems to help prevent theft and protect their property. Fortifying Mobile Security Vehicle armoring has emerged as an imperative innovation in law enforcement, offering a new level of protection in high-risk situations. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly turning to advanced armoring solutions, available at [police supply stores](https://danasafetysupply.com/), to safeguard their vehicles. These fortified vehicles are equipped with bulletproof glass and reinforced steel plating, providing a robust shield against attacks and threats. Furthermore, some armored vehicles are integrated with advanced features such as run-flat tires and explosion-resistant fuel tanks, allowing them to navigate hazardous situations safely. This innovation not only enhances the security of personnel but also enables them to carry out their duties more effectively, particularly in volatile environments. Virtual Reality Training – Preparing officers for real-life situations in a safe environment. In the world of law enforcement, preparation is key. To effectively protect and serve the public, officers must be trained to handle many situations – some more dangerous than others. But how can we ensure their preparedness without actually putting them in harm’s way? The answer lies in virtual reality training. This cutting-edge technology allows officers to experience real-life scenarios in a safe, controlled environment. Officers can practice their response tactics from active shooter situations to high-speed chases without the risk of injury or worse. Social Media Monitoring – Tracking criminal activity and gathering intelligence online. In today’s digital age, social media platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, the same networks that foster connections and keep us informed can also be used as a tool for criminal activity. This is why social media monitoring has become essential in tracking potential threats and gathering intelligence online. Law enforcement agencies and intelligence services are using specialized software to analyze social media interactions, filter out relevant data, and identify potential risks to public safety. Through social media monitoring, investigators can keep track of criminal activity and gain insights into the intentions and whereabouts of criminals. Technological Advancements in Law Enforcement In conclusion, technology has truly revolutionized the way law enforcement operates. A more data-driven and proactive approach has replaced traditional crime prevention and investigation methods. Predictive policing has proven to be an effective tool in anticipating and preventing crimes before they even occur. Body-worn cameras have [enhanced transparency and accountability](https://www.intelligentliving.co/5-common-misconceptions-about-police-officers/) within law enforcement agencies, fostering trust in the community they serve. Facial recognition technology has greatly aided in identification and investigations, allowing for quicker and more accurate results. Drones provide a new level of aerial surveillance, helping to reduce response times and ensure public safety. And virtual reality training equips officers with the necessary skills to handle real-life situations in a safe environment. Additionally, social media monitoring is proving to be a valuable tool in tracking criminal activity and gathering intelligence online.",

    "text": "Samsung factory strike in India continues after failed talks Despite government mediation, Samsung’s refusal to recognise the workers’ union has led to the ongoing strike at its key production facility in India. Samsung Electronics employees in India have [continued](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-state-minister-meet-samsung-officials-bid-resolve-strike-2024-09-12/) their strike for a fifth day after negotiations between the union, company management, and state government officials ended without agreement. The workers employed at a plant near Chennai are demanding higher wages, shorter working hours, and union recognition. The factory, which produces a range of appliances like televisions and refrigerators, plays a vital role in Samsung’s Indian operations, contributing up to 30% of the company’s $12 billion annual revenue in the country. Despite government efforts to mediate, including talks led by [Tamil Nadu](https://dig.watch/updates/tamil-nadu-secures-jabil-and-rockwell-automation-investment-deals)‘s labour minister, no resolution has been reached. Union leader E. Muthukumar stated that while Samsung management urged employees to halt the [strike](https://dig.watch/updates/samsung-workers-in-india-plant-begin-indefinite-strike), they refused to acknowledge the union, prompting workers to continue the protest. Hundreds of workers, clad in Samsung’s blue uniforms, have set up a makeshift camp outside the factory. Samsung [India](https://dig.watch/countries/india) has not commented on the latest developments but previously noted its commitment to addressing workers’ grievances and complying with local regulations.",

L'incontro si terrà il 6 settembre alle ore 20:45 allo Stade de France di Saint Denis, un luogo iconico che ha ospitato le gare di atletica delle recenti Olimpiadi di Parigi 2024. Donnarumma ha parlato del suo rapporto con Mike Maignan, portiere della Nazionale francese e suo collega nel Paris Saint-Germain. \"È un grande portiere e sta facendo molto bene, anche con la Francia ha fatto molto bene. Sono contento per lui\", ha dichiarato Donnarumma, sottolineando il rispetto e l'ammirazione reciproca tra i due atleti. Ha aggiunto che domani, in occasione della partita, gli farà i complimenti di persona. La sfida tra Francia e Italia non è solo un incontro tra due squadre nazionali, ma anche un confronto tra due portieri di altissimo livello che condividono lo stesso club. Questo rende l'incontro ancora più interessante e carico di significato. Donnarumma, che milita nel PSG, sente particolarmente questa partita, non solo per l'importanza della competizione, ma anche per il legame con la città di Parigi e i suoi tifosi. Il portiere italiano ha anche parlato del nuovo ciclo iniziato per la Nazionale italiana, esprimendo fiducia e ottimismo per il futuro. \"È iniziato un nuovo ciclo per l’Italia. Ecco come ho visto i miei compagni, abbiamo voglia di fare questo\", ha affermato Donnarumma, evidenziando la determinazione e la voglia di riscatto della squadra azzurra.",

    "text": "Suppressions d'emplois chez Volkswagen : les salariés allemands appelés à la grève à partir de lundi Par La Provence (avec AFP)\nPublié le 01/12/24 à 13:03\nLe siège du constructeur automobile allemand Volkswagen, le 26 mars 2021 à Wolfsburg.\nPHOTO D'ILLUSTRATION AFP / Ronny Hartmann\nCommenter Partager Dans les usines allemandes de Volkswagen, les salariés sont appelés à la grève à partir de ce lundi, ont annoncé le syndicat IG Metall. Ils dénoncent les suppressions d'emplois envisagées par le groupe. L'annonce des milliers de suppressions d'emplois ne passe pas chez Volkswagen. Les salariés du groupe sont appelés à cesser le travail à partir de lundi dans les usines allemandes pour s'opposer aux milliers de suppressions d'emplois envisagées, a annoncé dimanche le syndicat IG Metall. Vendredi, le constructeur, qui prépare un plan drastique d'économies, avait rejeté une contre-proposition syndicale visant à réduire les coûts sans avoir à fermer d'usines en Allemagne. Une décision qui laissait augurer d'un durcissement du dialogue social.\n\" Des grèves d'avertissement commenceront lundi dans toutes les usines \", indique le négociateur du syndicat, Thorsten Gröger,. Il tient la direction \" responsable, à la table des négociations, de la durée et de l'intensité de cet affrontement\" .\nDans un communiqué séparé, Volkswagen a dit \" respecter \" le droit des salariés à participer à une grève d'avertissement et dit croire en la poursuite d'un \" dialogue constructif \" pour \" parvenir à une solution durable et soutenue collectivement \".\nÀ lire aussi : Milliers de licenciements, fermetures d'usines, ventes en berne... mais que se passe-t-il chez Volkswagen ? L'entreprise précise avoir \" anticipé des mesures ciblées pour sécuriser l'approvisionnement d'urgence \" pendant le mouvement, et ce afin de \" limiter autant que possible \" son impact \" sur nos clients, nos partenaires et nos installations industrielles\" .\nLes représentants des salariés avaient présenté en novembre une contre-proposition incluant la suspension de bonus, d'augmentations de salaires, un allègement du temps de travail, permettant, selon eux, d'éviter fermetures d'usines en Allemagne et licenciements en masse. Mais cette offre n'a pas été jugée viable par la direction.\nLes représentants du personnel affirment qu'au moins 3 usines Volkswagen risquent de fermer en Allemagne et que des dizaines de milliers d'emplois pourraient être supprimés, les employés restants devant consentir à des réductions de salaire.\nÀ lire aussi : Stellantis, Nissan, Michelin, Volkswagen... pourquoi les suppressions d'emplois se succèdent dans l'automobile Dans le pays, Volkswagen compte dix sites de production de voitures et environ 300 000 salariés, dont 120 000 pour la marque VW, la plus concernée par le plan d'économies.\nFleuron de l'industrie automobile allemande, Volkswagen souffre à la fois du ralentissement du marché des véhicules neufs, de la concurrence chinoise, de modèles à batterie pas assez attractifs, et de coûts de main d’œuvre plus élevés que ses rivaux, selon les experts.\nDémarrez la conversation Votre opinion compte pour nous.
