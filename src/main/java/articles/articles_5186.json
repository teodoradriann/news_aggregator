    "text": "The exes got emotional as they apologized for past behavior to each other on the series premiere of their new show, in which Christina also opened up about her split from Josh Hall -- claiming she would get the \"silent treatment\" from him if she interacted with Tarek\nOver eight years following their split, Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa are looking back at what led to the end of their marriage -- and the ups and downs of their relationship since.\nDuring Wednesday's series premiere of HGTV's The Flip Off, the former couple sat down for a conversation at Christina's Newport Beach home, with Christina and Tarek both becoming emotional as they reflected on the struggles they've gone through since their divorce and ultimately -- and tearfully -- reached a place of forgiveness.\nGetty/Instagram\nChristina Haack Fires Back at Ex Josh Hall's Claims HGTV 'Manufactured Drama' on The Flip Off\nView Story\"I know we're in a good place now,\" Christina, 41, told Tarek, 43 through tears. \"But yeah, we went through a lot of stuff. I don't think anyone understands just how much stuff we went through.\"\n\"We met when we were so young,\" added Christina, who was 22 when met a then-24-year-old Tarek. \"When our stuff imploded, I felt like not only did I lose… we were best friends, but also I felt like I lost like, I need to be a full-time mom. And that really, really, really hurt me a lot and really affected me.\"\nTarek then also became emotional, telling his ex-wife, \"I understand that feeling of being a little bit lost. And I acknowledge that I'm a big part, if not the entire part, of all of this.\"\nThrough sobs, Christina apologized to Tarek, saying, \"I'm really sorry for s--t too. I really am. I just want you to know that.\"\nTarek reassured Christina that it was alright, putting his hand on her knee in comfort.\n\"Forgive me?\" Christina asked her ex, who replied, \"A hundred percent, yeah.\"\nHGTV\nChristina Haack Tearfully Tells Ex Tarek El Moussa That Their Kids Asked Her to Leave Josh Hall After Fight\nView Story\"A hundred percent. I did a lot of things too,\" Tarek said, getting choked up. \"I'm sorry. It's okay. I hold zero against you.\"\nThe emotional conversation continued as Christina praised Tarek's role as a father.\n\"You're a great dad. I'm really proud of you. You've come a really long way. I can see it, you know,\" she said to Tarek, who wiped tears from his face. \"You're so much calmer, you're so much wiser, for real.\"\nThe pair announced their split in December 2016 after seven years of marriage --- following an altercation involving a gun and the police, which Tarek detailed in his memoir, Flip Your Life: How to Find Opportunity in Distress — in Real Estate, Business and Life. No charges were filed against the HGTV star.\nWhile speaking in separate confessionals during Wednesday's premiere, both Christina and Tarek reflected on the dissolution of their relationship.\n\"I got diagnosed with cancer and then I hurt my back. I lost 60 lbs. because I was taking so many opiates and Vicodin and painkillers,\" Tarek told the TLC cameras. \"I lost my way, lost who I was. I just wasn't the best husband. I wasn't the best father. You know, I own my s--t. It wasn't me, but it was me.\"\n\"Tarek didn't always treat me right, and he'll admit that,\" Christina said, adding that her ex was \"more focused on work than his family.\"\n\"When we split up, it's like it forced him to be like, oh, I have to be present for these kids,\" she continued.\nTarek and Christina's marriage was finalized in 2018, and the two continued to film their show together, before it ended in 2022. Tarek went on to tie the knot with Heather Rae El Moussa in 2021. The couple welcomed son, Tristan, in February 2023.\nChristina, meanwhile, moved on with Ant Anstead, whom she married in 2018, and shares son Hudson. The pair split in 2020, and their divorce was finalized in 2021. Christina secretly tied the knot for a third time later that year, marrying realtor Josh Hall, before calling it quits earlier this year.\nGetty\nChristina Haack Claims Ex Josh Hall Felt 'Insecure' By Her During Their Marriage\nView StoryChristina Emotionally Reveals Josh Hall Split to Tarek\nChristina and Tarek's conversation on Wednesday's premiere began with the former revealing that her marriage to Hall had come to an end.\n\"I know that look. What's going on? You good?\" Tarek asked when he arrived at Christina's home, with the realtor telling her ex, \"No ... Josh and I officially split up.\"\n\"We had a blow up... middle fingers in my face,\" she continued. \"Things with Josh have been bad for a long time.\"\nChristina -- who shares Taylor, 14, and Brayden, 9, with Tarek, and son Hudson, 5, with ex Ant Anstead -- said her kids \"literally asked me to leave.\"\n\"They told me he's not nice to me. Why would I stick around?\" she added.\nThe mom of three claimed that Josh would often give her the \"silent treatment,\" and would not speak to her for several days if she happily interacted with Tarek.\nInstagram\nChristina Hall Questions Whether 'Unexplained' Health Issues Are 'Breast Implant Related'\nView Story\"You make him very insecure,\" Christina said. \"Every time we'd barely joke at [the kids'] soccer [games], or if I laughed at you, he like would not speak to me for two to thre days. I would get silent treatment.”\nShe then shared how Josh allegedly saw her, telling Tarek, \"He doesn't like me, calls me cocky. He thinks I'm arrogant. We both know I'm not cocky or arrogant. I just do work.\"\nTarek assured her that her ex was wrong. \"You're not any other those thing,\" he said. \"He's projecting. You’re a great mother, a great daughter. You are a great human.\"\nChristina went on to become emotional as she opened up about the struggles she's faced in relationships since she and Tarek split.\n\"I feel like I’m in a tornado all the time and I just can't get out of it,\" she said through tears/\nEverything since like 2016 has just been so hard and so horrible. There's so many good things but there's just so many bad things. It's just really taken a really bad toll on me.\"\nGetty\nAnt Anstead Defends Posting Photos of Son After Accusing Ex Christina Hall of Exploiting Him\nView Story\"I feel like I try to hide it and act like I’m not affected,\" she added, \"but then I just do more stupid things to try to make myself feel better and then I keep doing it and getting into things too fast that I know aren’t right.\"\nJosh filed for divorce from Christina in July 2024 after nearly three years of marriage, and the pair have since been involved in a contentious legal battle ever since. The Flip Off, which was announced in May 2024, two months before Josh and Christina's split, was originally set to star the now-exes as teammates competing in a house-flipping showdown against Tarek and his wife Heather.\nAfter Josh filed for divorce, Christina returned to filming without him.\nOn Wednesday's premiere, she reflected on the end of her third marriage in a confessional.\n\"I never wanted to get divorced,\" she said. \"I’m the only person in my family to ever get a divorce. So I just feel like it’s safer to be back in a relationship, but ultimately that was not safe either.\"\nThe Flip Off airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on HGTV.",

    "text": "Nestled amidst the emerald embrace of Long Island, Studio Khora rises as an exemplar of architectural alchemy, transforming modernist tenets into contemporary masterpieces.\nThe Pavilion house is a beacon of sustainable living, mirrors the ethos of top Long Island architects , marrying innovation with environmental stewardship. In an age where sustainability is not just a choice but a necessity, Studio Khora's design is a clarion call for the future of New York and Long Island's residential landscape.\nStudio Khora, distinguished among Long Island architects, has sculpted a space that resonates with Mies van der Rohe's minimalist spirit while speaking the complex visual language of Derrida's deconstruction. Here, form and function engage in a delicate dance, creating a living experience that transcends the confines of traditional architecture.\nThis house is not a mere dwelling but a vessel of light and air, a canvas where nature's palette unfurls in splendor. The architectural language of this Long Island jewel is a dialogue of contrasts, where Mies’s transparent simplicity meets the intricate layers of Derrida's philosophy.\nStudio Khora has adeptly translated these dialogues into a home that stands as a manifesto of fluidity, with glass expanses inviting the outside in, fostering a seamless bond with the land. In this space, contemplation and connection flourish, nurtured by the tranquil cadence of coastal life.\nThe narrative crafted by Studio Khora goes beyond aesthetic allure; it's an urgent response to the climatic challenges facing New York and Long Island. The house's sustainable blueprint is a testament to the firm's commitment to ecological integrity, featuring renewable resources, energy-efficient solutions, and a symbiotic relationship with its environment.\nThis approach not only minimizes the ecological footprint but also sets a benchmark for comfort and elegance. In this Long Island haven, sustainability is not an afterthought but the cornerstone of its creation. Studio Khora has reimagined the essence of coastal living, proving that luxury and environmental consciousness can coexist. The house's design is a bold step towards a greener, more resilient New York, where each structure not only shelters but also preserves and inspires.\nABOUT STUDIO KHORA\n[ STUDIO KHORA ] is a multidisciplinary design collaborative of visionary architects, lighting and interior designers, landscape architects, and builders engaged to deconstruct the traditional patterns of spatial design.

    "title": "Sospechan que muerte de niños en comunidades de Lempira fue por hongos tóxicos",
    "text": "La menor que murió el martes tenía siete años y fue ingresada al hospital en Gracias, Lempira, y trasladada al Mario Rivas.\nLa comunidad de San Antonio, en el municipio de San Manuel de Colohete, Lempira, permanece en silencio tras la trágica muerte de cuatro menores en menos de una semana, todos con síntomas similares.\nLa más reciente víctima fue Kerli Anahí Deras Vásquez, una niña de apenas siete años, quien murió el martes con un cuadro grave de dolor estomacal, vómito, diarrea y convulsiones.\nLa angustia crece entre los vecinos. Las muertes comenzaron días atrás con dos hermanitos que fueron trasladados al hospital Juan Manuel Gálvez de Gracias, Lempira, en busca de ayuda médica. A pesar de los esfuerzos del personal, ambos murieron.\nPoco después, otro menor —familiar de las víctimas— también murió tras presentar la misma sintomatología.\nJosé Miguel Peralta, director del hospital en Lempira, explicó que los cuatro niños presentaron sintomatología similar: dolor de estómago, vómito, diarrea y convulsiones, pero en los cuatro casos no se logró determinar qué estaba causando esos síntomas.\nEn el caso de Kerli, fue trasladada al hospital Mario Rivas, donde lamentablemente murió por una falla hepática. El cuerpo de la niña fue llevado a la morgue sampedrana, donde se le realizaron análisis toxicológicos e histopatológicos para determinar su causa de muerte.\nAunque estas son las primeras muertes que se registran en la zona por estas causas, son muchos más los habitantes de la comunidad de San Antonio que han presentado los mismos síntomas. El director del hospital indicó que la situación se viene reportando desde hace 15 días.\nSe registran al menos 10 casos de pacientes hospitalizados en el Mario Rivas que presentan dolor de estómago, diarrea y vómito, de acuerdo con las autoridades de la Región Sanitaria de Salud en Lempira. Se trata de dos mujeres y siete hombres en edades de entre 2 y 27 años. No todos están graves.\nEn la Regional de Salud de Lempira consideran que hay una alta sospecha de que la población está consumiendo hongos tóxicos (“Amanita muscaria/phalloides”, por su nombre científico).\nMediante un comunicado, indicaron que recomendaron a la población abstenerse del consumo del hongo, ya que en esta temporada se da su crecimiento.\nAutoridades sanitarias instaron a reforzar medidas de higiene y acudir de inmediato a centros médicos en caso de intoxicación, mientras se investiga la causa de una enfermedad que afecta a varias familias en la zona. Pruebas fueron enviadas al Laboratorio Nacional de Virología para su análisis.\n\"Cuando tengan síntomas como diarrea, vómitos, que acudan al centro de salud para que sean evaluados rápidamente y que nos permita llegar a un diagnóstico\", dijo Peralta.",
