Photograph: Con Chronis/AAP Jack Snape July 24, 2025 at 3:30 a.m. UTC · 2 min read\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt has recalled hulking forwards Rob Valetini and Will Skelton to add much-needed muscle for the must-win second Test against the British & Irish Lions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday.\nAustralia were easily overpowered in the first half of the opening Test in Brisbane last week when, despite showing improvement in the second half, they could not make up for their slow start and finished 27-19 losers.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Related: Owen Farrell named on bench for Lions’ second Test against Australia\nIn front of an expected crowd of more than 80,000 at the MCG, Valetini will start at blindside flanker after overcoming a calf injury in a huge boost for the hosts.\nThe return of the John Eales medallist pushes Nick Champion de Crespigny out of the side after his debut last week. Skelton’s recovery from his own calf injury forces Jeremy Williams onto the bench.\nThe only other change to the starting XV is David Porecki – who suffered a head knock against Fiji two weeks ago – replacing Matt Faessler at hooker, while backrower Langi Gleeson also returns from injury and replaces Tom Hooper on the bench.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement After the team’s training session in Melbourne’s Lakeside Stadium on Thursday, Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said the time spent in camp this week has been valuable as the team chases the quick improvement needed.\n“The squad has recovered well after a very physical first Test and the week’s preparation here in Melbourne has allowed us a bit more time together,” he said.\n“We took some confidence from the second half last week, but we know we’ll need to improve further against a Lions team that will bring plenty of fire to the contest on Saturday night.”\nNo 10 Tom Lynagh and scrumhalf Jake Gordon have been retained, despite facing intense pressure from a ferocious Lions defence last week.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Related: Melbourne’s rugby landscape opened up with Rebels’ demise – Storm are pouncing on the opportunity | Jack Snape\nSome had expected Tate McDermott to be given a chance in the No 9 jersey given his Reds connection to Lynagh and his impressive performance off the bench last week, but Schmidt has retained the 26-year-old as an interchange weapon.\nMelbourne product Harry Potter retains his place on the wing, while Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii remain Australia’s centre pairing as the side aims to keep the series alive for a decider in Sydney the following week.\nWallabies : 15-Tom Wright, 14-Max Jorgensen, 13-Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, 12-Len Ikitau, 11-Harry Potter, 10-Tom Lynagh, 9-Jake Gordon, 8-Harry Wilson, 7-Fraser McReight, 6-Rob Valetini, 5-Will Skelton, 4-Nick Frost, 3-Allan Alaalatoa, 2-David Porecki, 1-James Slipper; Replacements : 16-Billy Pollard, 17-Angus Bell, 18-Tom Robertson, 19-Jeremy Williams, 20-Langi Gleeson, 21-Carlo Tizzano, 22-Tate McDermott, 23-Ben Donaldson\nAdvertisement Advertisement",

    "text": "Thursday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed health care providers in Idaho could continue to perform emergency abortions for the time being. The formal decision comes a day after an opinion on the case was inadvertently posted on the court’s website.\nThe 6-3 opinion did not include a determination of the matter at the center of the challenge brought forth by the Biden Administration. The court opted to dismiss the appeal without considering whether Idaho acted within its rights or whether federal law superseded Idaho’s near-total ban on abortion.\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires all hospitals enrolled in Medicare to provide stabilizing care — including abortion care — to patients having a medical emergency.\n“We were hoping that there would be a more substantive decision from the Supreme Court that allowed that guidance to be in place in states across the country,” Wendy Davis, senior advisor for Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, said. “That’s not what happened.”\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett split from their conservative counterparts. They voted to dismiss the case alongside liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas joined in dissent.\nThe Idaho case is expected to return to the lower courts and the hands of district court judge B. Lynn Winmill, who previously blocked Idaho’s abortion law from going into effect.\nReproductive rights advocates felt the shockwaves of the Thursday decision in Texas. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton brought forth a similar case against the Biden Administration, which is currently pending in the courts.\nPaxton filed the lawsuit, challenging the federal government’s ability to require hospitals to offer emergency abortions. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Texas. If the ruling is challenged and goes to the Supreme Court, it will likely be heard next fall.\n“There will be no relief granted to people in Texas,” Davis said. “This could have provided doctors with more flexibility in determining when they could legally intervene when a patient’s health was at risk.”\n“We’re still living in the Fifth Circuit’s prohibition on applying EMTALA. It ruled that EMTALA could not trump state abortion laws,” she added. “So for Texans, that will continue to be the status quo unless or until the Supreme Court takes up this decision when it reconvenes in the fall.”\nAccording to Davis, the matter will likely go before the nation’s highest court only if President Joe Biden is reelected. If former president Donald Trump enters into another term, Davis said his administration will almost certainly implement a different interpretation of EMTALA that prohibits its use in superseding state abortion laws.\nDavis noted the longer-term concern she and other experts have is that the Supreme Court is essentially kicking the can down the road on this decision and the case involving access to a commonly used abortion drug, Mifepristone.\nThe nation's highest court heard oral arguments on this case in March and subsequently ruled against applying restrictions to the pill in June. However, Davis noted that their decision was based on standing.\n“It has a significant impact potentially. It’s not just that we have to wait for the next Supreme Court term when they take up the substantive merits of these questions,” Davis said. “It’s the fact that there may be an intervening Trump administration that creates the kind of clarity that anti-abortion extremists are looking for and does away with the need for the court even to consider the merits of these cases.”\n“We are grateful that women in Idaho were given some at least temporary relief from their state abortion law, but that is not the case for us here in Texas,” she added.",

    "title": "Basta de privilegios: el mensaje del Gobierno contra los gremios en las pantallas de Aeroparque - Infobae",
    "text": "El Gobierno publicó mensajes contra los gremios en medio de la medida de fuerza El Gobierno Nacional, encabezado por Javier Milei, intensificó su ofensiva contra los gremios aeronáuticos en medio de un conflicto que ha paralizado los vuelos de Aerolíneas Argentinas. Este viernes, los pasajeros que se encontraban en el Aeroparque Jorge Newbery fueron sorprendidos con mensajes críticos hacia los sindicatos proyectados en las pantallas del aeropuerto. Bajo el lema “Basta de privilegios”, las placas lanzadas por la Secretaría de Transporte buscaban responsabilizar a los gremios por los paros que han afectado a miles de personas en los últimos días.\nDos leyendas aparecieron en las pantallas de Aeroparque como parte de la estrategia de comunicación del Gobierno. El primer mensaje, en un tono directo, decía: “Basta de privilegios. Los gremios aeronáuticos te impiden volar mientras reclaman asientos en clase ejecutiva. Secretaría de Transporte. Ministerio de Economía. Si te están obligando a parar, denunciá al 134″. Este mensaje claramente apuntaba a uno de los beneficios más cuestionados por la administración actual: los pasajes gratuitos en clase ejecutiva para los pilotos y sus familias.\nEl segundo mensaje era aún más explícito al detallar las razones detrás de las huelgas: “Los gremios aeronáuticos hacen un paro porque quieren conservar sus privilegios: Pasajes gratis en clase ejecutiva, bono en dólares, sólo se movilizan con choferes”.\n“Basta de privilegios. Los gremios aeronáuticos te impiden volar mientras reclaman asientos en clase ejecutiva” (Transporte) Ambos mensajes reflejan el enfoque del Gobierno en su intento de limitar los beneficios que consideran “inmorales” y que, según sostienen, no pueden seguir siendo sostenidos por el erario público en un contexto de ajuste fiscal y crisis económica.\nLa ofensiva del Gobierno contra los gremios aeronáuticos no se limita a la batalla mediática. En varias oportunidades, el vocero presidencial, Manuel Adorni, y el secretario de Transporte, Franco Mogetta, han puesto el foco en las condiciones laborales y los beneficios que disfrutan los pilotos de Aerolíneas Argentinas. Durante una conferencia de prensa reciente, Adorni aseguró: “Diez de los 18 asientos de clase Ejecutiva fueron reservados para pilotos y sus familias en el vuelo inaugural a Punta Cana, quienes viajaron gratis, sostenidos por todos los contribuyentes” .\n“La línea del presidente Milei es combatir las castas, y los pilotos son un claro ejemplo de esto” (Mogetta) Este tipo de beneficios, que incluyen además salarios elevados, traslados pagados y días adicionales de descanso, están siendo objeto de una revisión por parte del Ejecutivo, que busca recortar lo que consideran “privilegios injustificables”. Entre las ventajas que perciben los pilotos se destacan salarios que oscilan entre los 3 y 10 millones de pesos mensuales, dependiendo de su antigüedad y la cantidad de vuelos realizados. Además, cuentan con el día libre en su cumpleaños, traslados en remises que se contabilizan como tiempo de trabajo, y acceso a pasajes gratuitos en clase ejecutiva, que han sido un punto central de las críticas gubernamentales.\nEl conflicto entre los gremios aeronáuticos y el Gobierno escaló en las últimas semanas, con paros que han generado cancelaciones de vuelos y afectado a miles de pasajeros. Los sindicatos, agrupados en la Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas (APLA), reclaman mejoras salariales y rechazan lo que consideran un ajuste en la política de la empresa. Por su parte, el Gobierno busca implementar medidas de mayor control y eficiencia en Aerolíneas Argentinas, la aerolínea de bandera.\nFranco Mogetta , secretario de Transporte, fue contundente en una reciente entrevista radial al referirse a las acciones que el Gobierno tomará para regular el sector: “La línea del presidente Milei es combatir las castas, y los pilotos son un claro ejemplo de esto. Tienen privilegios que no se ven en ninguna otra aerolínea del mundo. Vamos a ir a fondo en esto para que la gente pueda viajar en paz”.",
