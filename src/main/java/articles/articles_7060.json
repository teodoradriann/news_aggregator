    "text": "Dior, Saint Laurent, Chanel, Dolce&Gabbana... nel pieno della settimana della moda a Parigi, il Museo del Louvre inaugura una mostra unica che riunisce capolavori del suo dipartimento di oggetti d'arte e pezzi importanti della storia della moda contemporanea. \"Un dialogo sottile e leale tra le creazioni dagli anni Sessanta a oggi e le collezioni del dipartimento degli oggetti d'arte che ricordano questo legame molto forte tra arte e creatori\", descrive Laurence Des Cars, presidente e direttore del museo d'arte più visitato del mondo.\nFotoracconto Al Louvre il dialogo inedito tra moda e arte - Foto - Ansa.it\n“Offrire costantemente una rilettura delle collezioni del Louvre alle nuove generazioni di visitatori che hanno altri riferimenti culturali”, aggiunge Des Cars a Afp.\nIntitolata \"Louvre Couture\", questa mostra comprende un centinaio di pezzi di \"45 creatori, provenienti da vecchie case e creatori più giovani\", spiega Olivier Gabet, direttore del dipartimento degli oggetti d'arte del Louvre e curatore dell'evento, assistito da Marie Brimicombe.\n\"Non è un progetto generico sulla moda e sull'arte che spesso fa appello alla pittura. Abbiamo scelto di farlo specificatamente nel dipartimento degli oggetti d'arte che vanno da Bisanzio al Secondo Impero\" come \"una sorta di passeggiata\", continua. Nessuna scenografia complessa ma una miscela di silhouette firmate, tra gli altri, da Hubert de Givenchy, Marine Serre, Thom Browne, Alexander McQueen, Karl Lagerfeld o John Galliano, che risuonano su 9.000 m2 con la storia delle arti decorative e dell'artigianato.\nAbiti, gioielli e altri accessori moda scivolano tra vasi, oggetti liturgici, armature, arazzi, mobili e ricchi ornamenti dal Medioevo all'Impero, dal Rinascimento al Grande Secolo di Luigi XIV. Come un abito jacquard di lana stampato a mosaico e ricamato con cristalli, pietre e paillettes di Dolce&Gabbana, che fa eco a un mosaico dell'italiano Torcello (1050-1100 circa). Dopo il celebre abito “Musée du Louvre” in seta bianca ricamata di Christian Dior, le gemme si susseguono come un abito “cattedrale” stampato in 3D di Iris van Herpen accanto a preziosi reliquiari. Un altro abito in rete di corno di Hermes risponde a un arazzo del XVI secolo e una gonna in organza di seta e maglione incastonato in assemblaggi di fili metallici dorati di Rabih Kayrouz dialoga con un gruppo statuario ornamentale del XIII secolo in rame dorato. Un abito da ballo in velluto di Balenciaga campeggia nell'ampia sala da pranzo dei sontuosi appartamenti “Napoleone III” (1861), recentemente restaurati.",

    "text": "KSBW, CNN\nBy Zoe Sottile, CNN\n(CNN) — A California man spent ten days stranded in the mountains after he got lost on a hike, relying in part on large volumes of water to survive.\nLukas McClish, 34, set out for what he thought would be a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11, according to CNN affiliate KGO . But he became lost in the mountains – partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires .\nHis family officially reported him missing when he didn’t show up for a Father’s Day dinner on June 16, triggering search and rescue efforts, KGO reported.\nMcClish was eventually found on Thursday thanks to a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office, according to an X post from Cal Fire San Mateo, which said McClish was found in Big Basin Redwoods State Park – California’s oldest state park and home to towering ancient coast redwood trees.\n“There were multiple reports of witnesses hearing someone yelling for help, but the location of that person was hard to establish,” said Cal Fire.\nMcClish was found with “no major injuries and was reunited with his family,” according to the sheriff’s office .\nSpeaking with KGO, McClish said he was “tired and a little sore” after his ordeal. “I lost my voice,” he added.\nAll he had to survive in the forest were the clothes he was wearing when he left: “I left with just a pair of pants, and my pair of hiking shoes, and a hat,” he told KGO. “I had a flashlight, and a pair of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool. And that was about it.”\nHe attributed his survival to drinking lots of water from creeks and waterfalls he found as he hiked through the park each day, calling for help, according to CNN affiliate KSBW .\n“I just make sure I drank a gallon of water every day, but then after, getting close to the end of it, my body needed food and some kind of sustenance,” McClish told KGO.\nSeeing the number of search and rescue workers who worked to find him was “really humbling,” he said. “It was an awesome experience.”\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified a CNN affiliate that reported on Lukas McClish’s disappearance. It was KGO.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The talented teenage surfer who died in a shark attack on a remote South Australian beach has been identified as 15-year-old Khai Cowley. The young man died after his leg was torn off in the attack and he was pulled from the water near Ethel Beach in Innes National Park, on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula, about 1.30pm on Thursday. Witnesses said the horrific attack took place in front of his horrified father, who had brought his son there from his home in Seaford, Adelaide. Just two weeks ago, Khai had been named the “most outstanding grom artist” by his local surf club Seaview Road Board Riders. The talented teenage surfer who died in a shark attack on a remote South Australian beach has been identified as 15-year-old Khai Cowley. “The shark grabbed his leg, so another local ran out, jumped on his board and paddled out to help him,” one local told the Adelaide Advertiser. ‘The shark was surrounding them when the guy pulled the boy out of the water. There was a lot of blood. “He brought it to shore, but I think it was too late.” His friends have paid tribute to the young man online, posting on social media: “Fly high Kai, lots of love and I miss you already.” Emergency services desperately tried to save the teenager, but he could not survive his injuries. Your aunt Lauryn Barley has now created a GoFundMe appeal to raise funds for the family after the tragedy. “A white pointer suddenly snatched our beloved Khai from us while we were surfing in the Ethel Wreck off the coast of Yorke Penisula,” he posted. “I’m here to try and help raise money for my sister Kate and brother Tim to cover the cost of the funeral.” There has been a great deal of grief following the tragic news. ‘A boy with a lot of potential. He will hold a place in everyone’s hearts,” a family friend wrote on social media. A local fisherman said large sharks are a common sight along Marion Bay in Innes National Park. “We’ve seen some pretty big broncos in the area, but that’s normal here,” he said. ‘I went to take the boat out and the rangers blocked the way to Ethel’s house. “There is no mobile coverage in the park, so we didn’t know what had happened until we returned to Marion Bay.” Unfortunately, there have been a number of shark attacks in South Australia in recent months.

    "text": "First World War FPS game Isonzo already has a lot going for it. Its blend of high stakes, ARMA 3 style military simulation and more traditional, Battlefield and Call of Duty reminiscent multiplayer shooter design has made it stand out among historically focused games in its genre. Even better, its creators at BlackMill Games have done a good job of supporting the WWI era FPS, regularly updating the experience to keep players coming back to its recreation of Italian Front battlefields. Now, with the launch of a new limited time mode and an accompanying Steam discount, there’s never been a better time to check Isonzo out.\nIsonzo ‘s The Ascent game mode brings a big twist to the FPS game . In it, players will need to hunt down and avoid getting killed by opposing forces as usual, but now have to consider new directions of attack thanks to a mountain setting that emphasizes what BlackMill calls “extreme vertical gameplay.”\nTeams are split between Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies, with the former needing to scale the Marmolada mountain in their attack and the latter working to defend their place atop that same mountain. Each of these teams consists of 16 players. As the Italians, players will be able to climb the peak by using an existing route, following behind other soldiers who leave pitons and ropes behind, or by working their way up the cliff face by hand. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, are cramped into their headquarters atop the mountain, making them easier targets for their ascending enemies.\nThis mode is only available from now until April 24. Luckily, Isonzo is discounted by a significant 67% from now until April 17 on Steam, bringing its price down to $9.89 USD / £8.24. Grab a copy right here before The Ascent comes to a close.\nOr, if you’d rather check out more like Isonzo, take a look at our top multiplayer games and simulation games on PC.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.",

    "text": "Mercedes gives its flagship EV the 'aspirational look' it was lacking in new update\nMercedes-Benz (\nDDAIF) dealers stated, as previously reported in October 2023, that they had a hard time selling the German luxury automaker’s EQ line of electric cars.\nThey argued that the electric line does not align with the purview of most Benz buyers, lacking the “lust factor” of the Benz’s gas powered flagship cars, like the six-figure flagship S-Class sedan.\n\"Our cars need to be 'want' cars,\" they said. \"The S-Class has maintained good loyalty because it's aspirational. An EQS is not something that most people aspire to own.\"\nWith this in mind, Mercedes went back to the drawing board and came up with a new and improved flagship EV worthy of lofty aspiration.\nRelated: Lamborghini waves goodbye to its gas-guzzling era with a limited edition supercar original article\nUpon first glance, the new 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan has been visually redesigned to appeal to those stuffy old money-types.\nMercedes buyers who prefer the country club over the nightclub will appreciate the new styling, which substitutes the brash and flash for more subtle details. Gone is the massive three pointed star on the front and in is an S580-esqe three-bar grille with a signature Benz trinket — a proper Mercedes hood ornament.\nThe body still retains the EQS's signature 'jelly bean' appearance, but additional chrome accents and an AMG Line front bumper creates a distinct look over the outgoing EQ sedan.\noriginal article\nMost of the improvements to the new EQ occur inside the cabin, where passengers can enjoy the benefits of its thorough, comfort-oriented makeover. The rear seats in the EQS are the place to be, featuring additional foam padding as well as La-Z-Boy-style power backrests that can recline from 27 and 36 degrees of recline from the flick of a switch.\nThose who seek extra comfort (or want to sleep like a baby in their electric Mercedes), can opt for what Mercedes calls the 'Executive Interior Package.' In the package, the rear seats recline up to 38 degrees, and can be pneumatically adjusted for optimal seat depth.\nAdditionally, rear seat passengers can enjoy rapid heated seats, rear seat pillows, and a front passenger seat that can fold forward for additional legroom in the back for the ultimate chauffeur experience.\nMore Business of EVs:\nA full list of EVs and hybrids that qualify for federal tax credits Here’s why EV experts are flaming Joe Biden’s car policy The EV industry is facing an unusual new problem\nThe biggest change for the 2025 EQS is the addition of a larger battery. The new car gets a 118-kWh battery pack, a significant improvement from the 108.4-kWh pack in the outgoing EQS. Range figures have not been disclosed by Mercedes, but the automaker says that range has improved with the new battery.\nThe three-pointed star also says that the 2025 EQS will have a new regenerative braking software that enables greater energy recuperation, as well as a special software that helps preserve the brake pads and discs by automatically applying the pads to the discs from time to time.\nMercedes has not announced any pricing for the 2025 EQS Sedan, though they say that dealers will be getting the new version of the vehicle later in the year. The current EQS Sedan already yields a hefty price tag; starting at an eye-watering $104,400.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024 [Sign up for our e-News Alerts](/users/newsletters-dc/)\nSUBMIT FEEDBACK\nClick Below to:",

    "text": "The bodies returned for the final time to the villages that, in life, they had called home. Months of anguished waiting at an end, mourners embraced, wept, read tributes and lowered into the soil the remains of Israeli hostages recovered this week from the Gaza Strip.\nBut grief had to share space with fury at Israel’s leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for not agreeing to a cease-fire with Hamas that might have saved the captives’ lives.\n“You were abandoned, again and again, by the prime minister and his ministers, to Hamas’s tunnels,” Keren Munder — herself a former hostage — said as she buried her father, Abraham Munder, on Wednesday in his hometown, Nir Oz. Distant explosions and crackles of gunfire occasionally interrupted her eulogy, reminders of the war between Israel and Hamas, now in its 11th month.\nIsraeli forces this week recovered the bodies of six of the people taken hostage in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault on Israel: Mr. Munder, 79; Haim Peri, 80; Yoram Metzger, 80; and Alexander Dancyg, 75, all from Nir Oz; and Nadav Popplewell, 51; and Yagev Buchshtab, 35, both from a nearby community, Nirim.\nIt remains unclear precisely when or how they died. On Thursday, the Israeli military said forensic pathologists had tentatively concluded that the bodies of all six hostages showed signs of gunfire, but did not say whether the shots were fatal. They were found next to four other bodies without any bullet wounds, who were presumed to be their captors, the military said.\n“They were very much alive. They were not abducted dead. I was with them, I slept next to them,” said Danielle Aloni, a freed hostage who spent time with five of the men while captive in Gaza. “They could have been saved, and they should have been saved.”\nHamas led a massive surprise assault on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage during the attack. More than 100 of those kidnapped were released during a weeklong truce in November — many of them women and children, including Ms. Munder, Ms. Aloni and Mr. Buchshtab’s wife, Rimon.\nIsrael responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a ferocious bombing campaign and invasion that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, destroyed wide areas of the enclave and forced nearly all its residents to flee for their lives.\nMore than 100 of the captives remain in Gaza, including dozens who are presumed dead by Israeli authorities. There have been conflicting, unverified claims during the war that hostages were killed in Israeli bombardments or murdered by their guards.\nMr. Netanyahu has resisted intense and growing pressure from international allies, Israeli security chiefs and many ordinary Israelis to strike a cease-fire deal that would include the release of the remaining hostages. He has stiffened his conditions for a truce in recent weeks, and accused Hamas of doing the same.\nVowing “absolute victory” over Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu has called it the best way to free the captives. His critics call those goals contradictory.\n“It is clear to all that the return of the hostages is only possible through a deal,” the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, a support group, said in a statement on Thursday. “The recovery of the six bodies is no achievement; it is a testimony of the complete failure to reach a deal in time.”\nIsraeli military rescue operations have freed just seven hostages so far, while killing scores of Palestinians . The Israeli military has said such operations cannot free all the captives, many of whom are believed to be scattered in Hamas’s extensive warren of tunnels.\nOn the winding road to Nir Oz on Wednesday, a handful of people in black T-shirts held up signs asking the Munder family for forgiveness that its patriarch was not rescued in time.\nThe Oct. 7 assault devastated Nir Oz, a quiet, tightly knit kibbutz less than two miles from the Gaza border, where more than a quarter of the 400 residents were killed or abducted.\nThe Munder family embodies that suffering. Mr. Munder died in captivity and his son, Roy, was killed on Oct. 7. Three other family members were also kidnapped, and freed in November: Ruti, wife of the elder Mr. Munder; their daughter, Keren, and Keren’s son, Ohad, who was 9 years old.\nMerav Mor Raviv, Abraham Munder’s niece, described him as a gentle, humble man devoted to his family. She said the family had been informed that he survived at least until the beginning of the March.\n“They could have brought him back — there were enough possible deals on the table,” she said.\nAddressing her father at his burial, Keren Munder accused the government of “sacrificing you and those like you. If only they had not searched for an illusory picture of victory.”\nThe funerals drew relatives, friends and neighbors, but also strangers who drove in from around the country to stand in solidarity with the survivors. With characteristic Israeli informality, some mourners stood beside the graves in T-shirts, jeans and flip-flops.\nLarry Butler, 74, lost dozens of friends and extended family members in the Oct. 7 attack on Nir Oz. He said the kibbutz’s left-leaning residents felt profoundly abandoned by the right-wing government, for failing both to protect them and to bring home the hostages.\n“It makes you wonder if there’s really a future in Israel,” said Mr. Butler, gazing at graves that had joined the cemetery’s silent ranks since the attack.\nAll six of the hostages whose bodies were found on Monday were believed to have survived their ordeal for months, according to their families. The Israeli authorities had announced by last month that five of them — all save Mr. Munder — were presumed dead.\nAmong the last people to see the five of them alive were Ms. Aloni and her 6-year-old daughter, Emilia, who were captured in Nir Oz and held by Hamas for seven weeks. They were forcibly marched through the armed group’s tunnels, where they joined other captives from Nir Oz and Nirim, she said.\nMr. Metzger, who spoke Arabic, mediated with their captors. Mr. Dancyg, a Polish-born Israeli historian, gave impromptu lectures on Jewish history in an attempt to while away interminable days and nights underground, Ms. Aloni recalled.\nMr. Buchshtab was a kind, introverted man, a musician who also crafted his own instruments. His wife, Rimon, was held with him; the two were deeply devoted to one another, said Ms. Aloni.\n“He was quiet, almost never spoke, and was deeply withdrawn into himself. He and his wife sought to just take care of each another,” said Ms. Aloni. “They were such a special couple.”\nAt times, the guards would kick him when he snored in his sleep, Ms. Aloni said.\nThey were held in suffocating conditions underground without sunlight and little fresh air, Ms. Aloni said. The other captives, including the elderly, were forced to twist themselves into painful positions on the thin mattresses allotted to them in the tunnels.\n“But they were strong people, they didn’t cry. They weren’t afraid,” Ms. Aloni said. “They were scared, we were all terrified — but they also had this amazing resilience.”\nBut she wondered in horror at how they could have borne their captivity as the weeks became months with no end in sight.\n“I don’t know how anyone could endure for so long in those conditions,” she said. “I was there for 50 days, and it was a terrible, endless eternity.”\nTheir guards moved Ms. Aloni and her daughter several times within the labyrinthine network of Hamas-built tunnels zigzagging under Gaza. Sometimes, some of the male captives were with her, but at other times they were marched off to separate locations, she said.\nIn early November, she and Emilia were whisked away to another holding area. She never saw any of the five men again.\nThe post Families of Dead Hostages Vent Anger at Israeli Leaders Over War appeared first on New York Times .",
