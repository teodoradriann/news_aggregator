    "title": "Winter in London: Here's why you should visit despite cold, rain",
    "text": "The forecast for our trip to London was dreary. Rain. Heavy rain. Rain mixed with sleet. Rain with heavy winds. Cloudy with 60 percent chance of rain. “Hey, that means there’s a 40 percent chance it won’t rain,” our optimistic travel companion chirped.\nOur thought was that despite the weather, this winter could be the perfect time to visit London. London, past the 2023 King’s Coronation, is out of the limelight, and the city is settling in for its long (rainy) winter season. London’s top attractions remain open and the city’s theater scene is in high gear. There are also pop-up ice-skating rinks, riverside igloos (check out the Coppa Club with Tower Bridge views) festive markets ( Borough Market was our favorite, filled with food stalls and take-away street food), and miles of twinkling lights.\nAdvertisement\nSo what if the weather is gray? What better time to linger at afternoon tea, catch a show, roam the city’s legendary (and mostly free) museums, and, of course, enjoy drinks in a cozy traditional pub.\n Borough Market is filled with food stalls and take-away street food. Pamela Wright Shelter in the rain We wanted to stay somewhere centrally located, splurge on a hotel with lots of cushy, cozy elements, more intimate than grandiose. We decided to spend our first two nights at the recently renovated Beaumont Hotel, a beautiful property in the upscale Mayfair neighborhood.\nWe took the Tube, London’s underground subway system, from the airport to Mayfair (tip: the Tube the best way to get around the city, intuitively easy with smart card tap-and-go access), and walked the short distance — in the rain with rolling suitcases — to The Beaumont, where we were immediately and warmly welcomed into the hotel, wet suitcases and jackets whisked away, and hot tea and pastries served while they prepared our room. So civilized — we liked this hotel already.\nThe Beaumont successfully mixes Art Deco, 1920s Jazz Age glamour with old-school luxury, and throws in a little colorful, modern flourish. It’s housed in a former parking garage, with the Room, a topsy-turvy, stainless-steel sculpture by artist Antony Gormley protruding on one side. You can book the Room if you like dark, narrow spaces. We went for more traditional rooms, spacious and handsome, with marble, mosaic, and glass baths, luxe linens, and D.R. Harris amenities. We loved the public spaces: Gatsby’s Room, a private club-like art-filled space that serves afternoon tea and evening champagne; Le Magritte Bar & Terrace, a lively bar decorated with artist Rene Magritte paintings; and The Colony Grill, a beautiful restaurant with Old World elegance brightened with colorful, hand-painted commissioned wall murals. One rainy, cold evening we dined at The Colony, sharing plates of smoked eel carbonara, sea bream ceviche, Dover sole meuniere, and dry-aged rib eye steak cooked over charcoal and English oak. And one late afternoon, we booked massages at the hotel’s snug, down-under spa, with a hammam, steam room, and sauna — a perfect end to a day of sightseeing in the rain.\nAdvertisement\nPeople enjoy takeout food outside the Borough Market in London. Pamela Wright We spent our last two nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel in the bustling Bloomsbury ‘burg in central London, home to the massive British Museum, and the former stomping grounds of literary greats such as Charles Dickens, T.S. Eliot, and Virginia Woolf. The hotel was a delightful place to stay, an intimate oasis, tucked down a short alley, with a friendly, knowledgeable staff, and luxurious rooms. It felt more like a luxury townhouse than a hotel, with classic design (think: lots of wood, lush fabrics, period furnishings) and Art Deco touches. Rooms were plush, painted in soothing neutral colors, with luxury marble baths. Downstairs, in the hotel’s public spaces, was a kaleidoscope of colors and textures. The Coral Room is a stunning bright pink and draws a lively cocktail crowd in the evenings, and the indoor-outdoor Dalloway Terrace restaurant is a popular place for all-day dining. We were surprised the al fresco eatery was open for dinner on the chilly, wet night we visited. The roof and side flaps were down, heaters were on, blankets were draped over the chairs, and we were further warmed by dishes like the Jerusalem artichoke velouté, fresh crab linguine, and wild sea bass with a side of hot, bubbly black truffle potato au gratin.\nAdvertisement\nIt wasn’t a one-off; all across the city, we noticed people eating and drinking al fresco, despite the rain.\nLondoners don’t let a little rain stop them from dining and drinking outdoors. Pamela Wright Fancy a pint? “Why are so many people standing outside the pub, drinking in the rain?” we asked the bartender at the Lamb & Flag pub. There was a crowd gathered outside the pub, seemingly oblivious to the drizzle and falling temperatures.\n“We’re Brits!” he answered. “Punters don’t let a little rain stop them.”\nLondon is home to 3,500 or so pubs, some of which have been around for 200 years or more. Pretty much, you can turn any corner and find a suitable pub to duck into, dry out, and wet your whistle. Some of our favorites included the aforementioned Lamb & Flag , a historic pub in Covent Garden established in 1623 and a favorite watering hole for Charles Dickens (Dickens had a bloody lot of watering holes around the city!) Other favorites included Mr. Fogg’s Tavern , a Victorian gem, filled with vintage artifacts; Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese , with its maze of nooks and crannies dating back to the 1500s (Dickens drank here!), and The George , an old rambling, crooked and sagging coaching inn built in 1776. (Dickens drank here!)\nAdvertisement\nEnjoying drinks in a traditional pub is even more enjoyable in London during winter, when it’s often cold and rainy. Pamela Wright Roam the museums Winter is a great time to visit London’s world-renowned museums. The British Museum , the first national public museum in the world, has a permanent collection that includes some eight million works, the largest in the world. Tickets to the permanent collection are free; there’s a charge for some special exhibitions. This winter, the museum will host several special exhibitions, including Legion, an inside look at the Roman Empire through the eyes of a real soldier (Feb. 1-June 23) and Superb Line, showcasing prints and drawings from Genoa’s Golden Age, from 1500 to 1800 (through April 1).\nThe National Gallery, also free, is home to more than 2,300 works, including many famous paintings, such as van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait , Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus , Turner’s Fighting Temeraire and Van Gogh’s Sunflowers . This winter, until March 10, the museum will host a variety of special exhibitions, including Pesellino: A Renaissance Master Revealed, a first-ever exhibition dedicated to Francesco Pesellino, an overlooked Renaissance great.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Pune: The Maharashtra labour department has begun mapping gig workers to create a centralised database in a key step towards extending legal protection and welfare benefits to them.State labour minister Aakash Fundkar told TOI on Friday that the comprehensive policy, expected to be announced by the year-end, would cover platform-based workers across companies and offer benefits such as health and accident insurance, pension schemes, skill development, and emergency financial aid. \\\"There are 321 registered e-commerce establishments in the state. A robust database is essential to ensure effective delivery of benefits and safeguard workers' rights,\\\" Fundkar said. A review meeting was held in Mumbai on Thursday. The meeting saw representations from Pune and Mumbai, including workers' groups and platform companies.Fundkar stressed the govt's commitment to bringing gig workers under the ambit of labour laws and relevant social security codes. \\\"States like Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Telangana are already moving in this direction. We, too, are working along similar lines and should be able to finalise the policy soon,\\\" he said.You Can Also Check: Pune AQI | Weather in Pune | Bank Holidays in Pune | Public Holidays in PuneSo far, two to three meetings have been held, but more consultations are planned, with wider stakeholder participation, including workers' collectives and platform operators. \\\"This is a crucial step in bringing gig workers on a par with the organised sector. They must not remain outside the scope of govt labour protections,\\\" the minister added.Workers have voiced concerns over job insecurity, absence of benefits, and erratic income. \\\"Once we lose our jobs, there is no safety net. Many of us work two to three shifts a day just to make ends meet,\\\" said a gig worker representative.Fundkar said the state is exploring ways to integrate gig workers into existing labour laws or create specific provisions tailored to their needs. \\\"Concrete steps are being planned to include them under relevant social security codes. Gig workers deserve the same dignity and support as any other worker in the formal economy,\\\" he said. A senior official from the labour department told TOI that the draft policy envisions benefits such as health and accident insurance coverage, pension and retirement savings schemes, access to skill training programmes, and emergency financial assistance in crises.Thursday's meeting was attended by MLA Ravindra Chavan, labour principal secretary I.A. Kundan, unorganised workers immediate commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, labour commissioner Dr. H.P. Tummod, and senior representatives from leading platform companies.With gig workers across India demanding better working conditions and formal recognition, Maharashtra's proactive approach could serve as a model for other states if implemented effectively, labour officials said. \\\"The gig economy is the future of employment. We cannot afford to ignore the rights and welfare of this large and growing section of workers,\\\" Fundkar said.Stay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).

    "text": "Man celebrates last day of work after 48 years at supermarket chain WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades. It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work. Outside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service. “That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.” Inside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16. “He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said. “He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll. Mick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway. “It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.” As the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family. “I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said. Mick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job. Copyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

The grants – administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal’s Office of Community Renewal – were awarded to nonprofit organizations and localities to help preserve affordable housing, support veterans and older New Yorkers, increase access to homeownership, and strengthen local economies. Central New York is the recipient of over $4 million in awards and will serve a proposed 109 units. The City of Cortland and the Village of Homer will receive $500,00 and $480,000 respectively to help with projects that improve communities and benefit their residents. Housing grants can be used for housing rehabilitation of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes, down payment assistance for low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, and private water/wastewater system assistance for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Home Headquarters Inc. and Onondaga County Community Development will receive $239,200 and $150,000 respectively to make homes accessible for low- and moderate-income persons with disabilities so that they can continue living safely and comfortably in their residences or return to live in their residences instead of in an institutional setting. Cayuga County Homsite Development Corp. and Stoneleigh Housing, Inc. will receive $500,000 and $200,000 respectively to assist senior citizen homeowners with the cost of addressing emergencies and code violations that pose a threat to their health and safety or affect the livability of the home. Assistance for the cost of these critical repairs enables seniors to continue to live independently in their homes. Covenant Housing Corp. of Central New York, Community Action Program for Madison County, the City of Fulton and Cayuga County Homsite Development Corp. will receive $400,000, $429,670, $585,500 and $700,000 respectively to acquire and/or rehabilitate single-family housing, provide down payment assistance, replace dilapidated mobile and manufactured homes as well as provide tenant-based rental assistance to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income. “As housing costs continue to rise, this significant investment will help carve out a path to affordable homeownership for 1,400 New York families,” Hochul said. “My administration is using every tool at our disposal to address the state’s housing crisis, and we will continue to push forward on programs, strategies, and funding initiatives that put New Yorkers in safe, affordable homes.”",

    "title": "\"Le pire jour de ma vie\" : Un survivant de la tragédie dans une discothèque en République dominicaine raconte comment il a réussi à s'en sortir",
    "text": "Ce qui devait être une nuit de joie et de musique au club Jet Set de la République Dominicaine s'est transformé dans la matinée de mardi en un cauchemar pour les participants, lorsque le plafond de l'établissement s'est effondré pendant un concert du célèbre merenguero Rubby Pérez.\nL'un des survivants de la tragédie est Cristóbal Moya, un homme dont l'image frappante, blessé, a été rendue virale sur les réseaux sociaux. Cependant, il a survécu, bien qu'il n'ait pas hésité à qualifier cette expérience du pire jour de sa vie.\n“Le pire jour de ma vie”, a résumé la dure expérience depuis l'hôpital où il se remet.\n\"J'ai pu sortir parce que j'étais à la même porte. Dieu m'a donné une seconde chance. Je le vois comme ça,\" a affirmé dans des déclarations à Univision.\nCristóbal Moya, comme tant d'autres ce soir-là, profitait de l'ambiance festive du Jet Set.\nRien ne semblait anormal, jusqu'à ce qu'un signe inattendu marque le début du désastre.\n“J'ai vu le plafond se briser, un plafond, et une sorte de sable a commencé à tomber, et en une seconde, j'ai perdu connaissance”, a rapporté l'homme au média cité.\nL'effondrement n'a laissé aucun temps pour réagir. Selon son témoignage, il a à peine ressenti \"un coup dans la nuque\" et est tombé au sol, inconscient.\nLorsqu'il se réveilla, il se trouva piégé sous les décombres, avec une douleur insupportable et incapable de bouger.\n“Alors là, ça m'est tombé dessus comme un débris, mais le débris est tombé sur un meuble et ce qu'il a fait, c'est me comprimer. J'étais avec les genoux ici sur la poitrine, je ne pouvais pas me déplacer en arrière ni en avant, le poids derrière était très lourd”, a-t-il raconté.\nLe bon samaritain\nAu milieu du chaos, de la poussière et des cris désespérés de ceux qui étaient blessés ou qui demandaient des nouvelles de leurs proches, Moya trouva un rayon d'espoir : une voix parmi les décombres.\n“Il y avait un bon Samaritain qui s'est approché de moi et m'a dit, ‘ne t'inquiète pas, je vais t'aider, comment t'appelles-tu, moi je m'appelle fulanito, ne t'inquiète pas, ne t'inquiète pas’”, a-t-il déclaré au sujet de la personne qui est devenue son ange gardien.\nMoya, encore ému par son expérience, a maintenant une nouvelle préoccupation : il n'a pas pu retrouver les trois personnes qu'il se trouvait cette nuit-là.\nUne tragédie nationale\nLe collapse du Jet Set a choqué la République Dominicaine. Les autorités ont décrété trois jours de deuil national et ont confirmé un bilan provisoire de 124 morts et 155 blessés.\nSelon les informations de José Antonio Matos, vice-ministre de la Santé, l'accident s'est produit vers 1 heure du matin, alors que le concert de merengue battait son plein.\nDes équipes de secours ont travaillé sans relâche pour enlever les décombres et sauver les personnes coincées, transférant les blessés vers différents hôpitaux de la région.\nLes images diffusées depuis la scène sont bouleversantes : des tas de béton effondré, des feux de détresse, et des corps recouverts attendant une assistance médicale.\nDehors du local, des membres de la famille se sont rassemblés en chantant des hymnes d'espoir, attendant des nouvelles de leurs proches.\nSur les réseaux sociaux, des photographies et des listes avec les noms de personnes ayant assisté à l'événement et qui n'ont pas encore été retrouvées ont été partagées.\nLa Red Publique de Santé (SNS) a rendu publiques des listes de blessés avec les hôpitaux où ils sont internés et a demandé des dons de sang de toute urgence. De plus, une ligne téléphonique *462 option 3 a été mise en place pour fournir des informations à jour sur les blessés.\nUn des décédés dans la tragédie était le chanteur Rubby Pérez, âgé de 68 ans. Un autre des décédés est le anciens joueur des Grandes Ligas, Octavio Dotel.\nQuestions fréquentes sur la tragédie survenue à la discothèque Jet Set en République Dominicaine\nQue s'est-il passé à la discothèque Jet Set de République Dominicaine ?\nDans la matinée de mardi, lors d'un concert du merenguero Rubby Pérez, le toit de la discothèque Jet Set s'est effondré, causant une tragédie qui a fait au moins 124 morts et 155 blessés. L'effondrement a provoqué des scènes de chaos et de choc parmi les participants et dans tout le pays.\nComment Cristóbal Moya a-t-il réussi à survivre à l'effondrement du plafond ?\nCristóbal Moya a survécu parce que il se trouvait près de la sortie lorsque l'effondrement s'est produit. Bien qu'il soit resté piégé sous les décombres, un bon samaritain l'a aidé à sortir, lui offrant de l'espoir au milieu du désastre.\nQuelle a été la réaction du gouvernement de la République dominicaine face à la tragédie ?\nLe président de la République dominicaine, Luis Abinader, a décrété trois jours de deuil national et a assuré que le gouvernement suit de près la situation. Les organismes de secours ont travaillé sans relâche dans les opérations de sauvetage et ont fourni une assistance aux personnes touchées.\nQuelle est la situation actuelle des blessés et des disparus suite à l'effondrement ?\nLes autorités ont confirmé que 155 personnes ont été blessées et reçoivent des soins médicaux dans divers hôpitaux. Il y a encore des personnes disparues, et des lignes téléphoniques ont été mises en place pour fournir des informations actualisées et solliciter des dons de sang.\nArchivé dans :",

    "text": "> SEOUL, Dec 30 — Two South Koreans have been released after being abducted nearly three weeks ago by an unidentified armed group in Nigeria, the foreign ministry in Seoul said today.\nKidnapping for ransom is common in Nigeria and foreign workers have been targeted in the past by criminal gangs, especially those working in remote mining or construction projects.\nThe two Koreans, who were abducted in southern Nigeria on December 12, are employees of Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co, a major South Korean builder, according to Seoul’s Yonhap news agency.\nSouth Korean authorities secured their custody yesterday, Seoul’s foreign ministry said, further stating that they are in good health.\nAdvertisement The men “have been moved to a safe area after a medical examination, and have spoken to their families” via phone, the ministry said in a statement sent to AFP.\nThe foreign ministry said their release was secured thanks to “close cooperation” between the government in Seoul and the company, and through “collaboration” with Nigerian military, police and intelligence authorities.\nIt did not state if any ransom was paid.\nAdvertisement During the abduction incident, members of the armed group killed four bodyguards, who are Nigerian soldiers, as well as two local drivers, Seoul said in the statement.\nThe South Korean government vowed to “continue to review the measures for the protection” of its nationals in Nigeria.\nSeoul will “actively engage with relevant government agencies, businesses, and overseas Koreans to prevent kidnapping incidents,” it added.\nSeveral Asian companies including from China and South Korea operate in Nigeria and are often involved with the country’s road and railway construction projects. — AFP",

    "text": "Los tres policías que habrían colaborado con una organización vinculada a la minería ilegal en Amazonas, podrían ser pasados al retiro por medida disciplinaria si las investigaciones así lo determinan, advirtió hoy el viceministro de Orden Interno del Ministerio del Interior, Juan José Santiváñez Antúnez. El representante del Mininter detalló que los suboficiales fueron puestos a disposición de la Comisión de Alto Nivel, dispuesta por el Gobierno, la cual llegó a la provincia de Condorcanqui para dialogar con los nativos Wampís, quienes habían retenido a estos agentes policiales y a otros seis civiles. Precisó que la acción de este grupo de alto nivel no fue para rescatar a estas nueve personas de su retención, sino para, a través de una acción conjunta con el Ministerio Público, ponerlos a disposición de la justicia. “Se están iniciando internamente en la Policía Nacional, las investigaciones para proceder de acuerdo con la ley de régimen disciplinario y, en caso las investigaciones lo determinen, ser pasados al retiro por medida disciplinaria”, subrayó el viceministro.\nLee también: Ministro del Interior y agricultores coordinan trabajo conjunto para garantizar seguridad\nLos detenidos habrían incurrido en un presunto favorecimiento a la minería ilegal, al transportar de Ecuador a Perú maquinaria destinada a esta ilícita actividad, a través del río Santiago, lo que motivó que los habitantes de las comunidades del distrito del mismo nombre procedan a realizar la detención ciudadana. Tras la llegada de esta Comisión de Alto Nivel a la zona, los tres policías y seis civiles fueron puestos a disposición de esta delegación oficial, que el último martes se reunió con representantes de esta comunidad para efectuar las coordinaciones del caso.\nEn dicho encuentro, el viceministro escuchó el sentir de los nativos de la Nación Wampís, quienes demandan mayor seguridad y rechazan actividades que dañan el medioambiente y generan violencia, como la minería y la tala ilegal, así como sus delitos conexos. Además, informó que, en el marco de los acuerdos adoptados con la comunidad, se dispondrá mayor presencia de policías en la zona, quienes incluso podrían instalarse en un local del Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (Sernamp). Saludó además la genuina voluntad de los dirigentes Wampís de dialogar y defender su territorio de la minería ilegal, y reafirmó el compromiso del Gobierno de promover actividades económicas que desalienten a la población a incurrir en este flagelo. Además del viceministro Santiváñez Antúnez, participaron en la mesa de diálogo el Alto Comisionado para el Combate de la Minería Ilegal, Rodolfo García Esquerre, el secretario técnico Wampís, Kefren Giraña Yagkuar, y otros líderes de esta comunidad.\n(FIN) NDP/RMCH/JCR\nMás en Andina\nUna propuesta presentada ante la mesa de partes del Congreso, por medio de un proyecto de ley de reforma constitucional, establece el derecho a la propiedad del suelo y subsuelo a las comunidades campesinas y nativas.\n?? https://t.co/MSDmLja9C4 pic.twitter.com/mLHQWmXrQw\n— Agencia Andina (@Agencia_Andina) April 25, 2024",
