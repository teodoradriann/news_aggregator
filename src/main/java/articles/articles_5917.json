On the other hand, Bula Central School, meanwhile, received learning packs and whiteboards from USAID&#39;s Advancing Basic Education in the Philippines (ABC+) Project.\nAngara thanked the UNICEF and USAID for their assistance in reinforcing DepEd’s learning recovery efforts.\nAngara also monitored the situation of Minalabac National High School which was heavily damaged by flood. He also visited Rodriguez National High School where he checked on the school’s unique digital classroom equipped with computers and internet access, used for coding lessons by senior high students.\nDuring his Bicol tour, Angara also inaugurated Camarines Sur’s first learning and development center for teachers, the Academy of Inclusive Learning and Development (iLEAD). The facility offers training programs for professional growth, allowing educators to customize their learning paths.\n“For us at DepEd, this is just an initial visit. Rest assured that more actions will follow. You can count on us to continue advocating for quality education for every child,” Angara told the teachers.\nAccompanying the Secretary were Camarines Sur 2nd District Rep. LRay Villafuerte, Gov.

    "title": "Matthew Perry’s ketamine OD prompts questions about its use for mental illness | News | bradfordera.com",
    "text": "(TNS) — The death of actor Matthew Perry in October from ketamine has prompted new concerns and scrutiny focused on unapproved uses of the drug. Ketamine is used as an anesthetic in hospitals, where it has a long history of safe usage. It also has been abused as a recreational drug. Most recently, it has shown promise as an alternative treatment for unusually difficult cases of mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although it’s not FDA-approved for psychiatric illnesses, doctors can legally prescribe it as an off-label treatment. Meanwhile, a pandemic-era waiver allows doctors to prescribe ketamine via telemedicine without an in-person exam. Some patients receive ketamine at clinics or at home in the presence of a therapist, and some use it unsupervised at home. Perry battled alcohol and drug addiction for all of his adult life. He was open about his struggles, detailing his dozens of treatment stays and the profound toll of addiction on his health. Perry, 54, had been getting ketamine infusions legally from a clinic to treat depression. However, an autopsy determined the ketamine found in his body after his death on Oct. 28 couldn’t have been from his most recent known treatment, because too much time had passed, according to The New York Times, which reviewed the autopsy report. While the Los Angeles medical examiner ruled that ketamine was the primary cause of his accidental drowning in a hot tub, other contributors included heart disease and buprenorphine, which is commonly used to treat opioid addiction and sometimes as a painkiller. The ketamine would have accelerated his heart rate while slowing his breathing, according to the medical examiner. In October — several weeks before Perry’s death — the FDA published a warning about ketamine, citing risks including abuse, increased blood pressure and bladder problems, and risks of using it at home without a health care provider being present. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was already working on new rules that would limit use of telemedicine to prescribe drugs including ketamine. Deaths such as Perry’s are considered rare. Still, it has prompted new discussion and concern. The American Society of Ketamine Physicians, Psychotherapists and Practitioners called the star’s death “a wake-up call for ketamine practitioners and the wider medical community to put clear and unified guardrails in place guided by real-world data and medicine,” the Washington Post reported. The non-profit group said it would devise guidelines for using ketamine at home. According to MedPage Today, psychiatrist Drew Ramsey of Spruce Mental Health in Jackson, Wyoming, wrote on social media: “In clinical settings, ketamine is known for its safety profile. That doesn’t mean it is safe.” Ramsey also “cited celebrity, substance use disorders, character pathology, psychedelic medicine, and concierge medicine” as possible factors in Perry’s death. Adam Kaplin, chief scientific officer for Mira Pharmaceuticals, cited by The Washington Post, believes ketamine has great potential to help people with psychiatric illnesses said Perry’s death shows “it is a very potentially dangerous practice to give patients access to this at home.” At the same time, assorted start-ups are working to increase access to ketamine for people with hard-to-treat depression and other mental illnesses. One point of contention centers on those who believe the drug should be used only in the presence of a trained therapist, and others who say the treatment will be unaffordable for many patients if they aren’t allowed to use it at home, according to the Post.",

The storm packed winds of 130 mph and stayed on the ground for 30 minutes before weakening and lifting just south of Union Lake. NWS says the most significant damage from the tornado is north of Colon to north of Sherwood. Several homes reportedly lost roofs and walls, and many trees were uprooted. Fortunately, no deaths were reported. However, there was one injury near Colon. According to [our sister station WOOD-TV](https://www.woodtv.com/weather/weather-news/national-weather-service-confirms-ef2-tornado-in-portage-tuesday/), this tornado prompted the [first tornado emergency ever issued in Michigan](https://www.wndu.com/2024/05/08/whitmer-declares-state-emergency-southwest-michigan-after-tornadoes-severe-storms/).

    "text": "近日，福建一5歲女童在遊泳時感染阿米巴原蟲症（俗稱“食腦蟲”）的消息登上熱搜，而安徽合肥一位家長也發帖求助稱，自己的6歲兒子感染狒狒阿米巴原蟲，目前已轉至上海治療。7月2日上午，該家長告訴上遊新聞（報料郵箱：baoliaosy@163.com）記者，經過藥物治療，孩子已經退燒，不過還未脫離危險。國內連續出現兩例罕見的阿米巴原蟲感染。專家稱，“食腦蟲”感染是小概率事件，但家長還是要注意，避免孩子去湖泊、溪流等天然水域遊泳。\n6月出現兩例阿米巴原蟲感染\n7月2日上午，上遊新聞記者聯係上了安徽合肥的朱女士，她目前正在帶著6歲的兒子在複旦大學附屬兒科醫院感染傳染科進行治療。\n朱女士介紹，6月17日孩子突然發燒，還伴有頭痛，6月18日-20日分別在合肥市當地多家醫院進行了檢查，都說是病毒感染。6月23日又到安徽省兒童醫院住院，一直沒有查到具體病因，孩子還是一直發燒，6月27日轉院至上海複旦大學附屬兒科醫院治療，6月30日通過腰穿腦積液檢查，才確定是感染了狒狒阿米巴原蟲。\n孩子感染阿米巴原蟲，朱女士發帖求助。網絡圖\n“體溫最高曾到39度6左右，從前天晚上到今天沒有發燒，醫生說是他自己身體在恢複，可能也有用藥的原因，目前精神狀態還不錯，就是走路有些不穩。”朱女士說，“我們以為退燒後的孩子就要好了，可是醫生找我們談話，說這個病太可怕了，醫院也在緊急聯係對應藥企，尋找正規途徑購買特效藥。”\n朱女士透露：“（今天）下午醫院會請一些專家過來會診，張文宏醫生可能會過來。”\n7月2日上午，複旦大學附屬兒科醫院相關部門負責人告訴上遊新聞記者，確實有一位患兒因阿米巴原蟲症在醫院進行治療，但涉及隱私對於具體會診和治療情況不便透露。\n除了在複旦大學附屬兒科醫院治療，朱女士還在網上發帖尋求特效藥物。\n朱女士兒子的檢測報告單。受訪者供圖\n兩名孩子家長尋求特效藥\n此前福建一名家長在社交平台的求助稱，5歲女兒在6月22日出現頭痛低熱嘔吐的情況（曾於6月7日和6月14日遊泳和泡溫泉），23日住院後出現抽搐，隨後昏迷不醒，並轉入重症監護室，6月27日被檢測出福氏耐格裏阿米巴原蟲，情況非常危急。最後通過網友幫助，用空運的方式購得一些治療藥物，相關新聞也登上了熱搜。\n近日，福建一家長發文求助，稱女兒感染福氏耐格裏阿米巴原蟲。網絡圖\n醫療大V、藥物學博士、加州大學舊金山分校（UCSF）醫療中心資深藥劑師江凱文此前曾表示，自己所在醫院有過救治阿米巴原蟲感染患者的例子，也已經向朱女士和福建家長提供了藥物治療方案，雖然兩個孩子都是阿米巴原蟲感染，但是男孩患的是肉芽腫性阿米巴腦炎（致病原為狒狒阿米巴原蟲），女孩患的是原發性阿米巴腦膜腦炎（致病原為福氏耐格裏阿米巴原蟲），男孩情況也很危險，但應該還有救。\n朱女士向上遊新聞記者證實，自己和福建那位患病孩子的家長都向江博士發出了求助信息，對方也都提供了相應的治療方式和藥物名稱。自己已經聯係上了福建這位家長，也得到了一些對方找到的藥物。\n據《科學》2023年報道，美國加州大學舊金山分校（UCSF）研究人員在篩選了數千種化合物後發現，與其他藥物相比，中國一款名為APL-1202（硝羥喹啉）的在研膀胱癌治療藥物，展現出對阿米巴原蟲感染具有一定的治療潛力。隨後，美國醫療團隊向中國相關藥企發出緊急援助請求，給藥後患者恢複情況良好。\n今年初有媒體報道稱，該企業相關項目負責人介紹，公司已經在全球範圍內為8名阿米巴原蟲病患者提供了類似的用藥援助，包括美國2名、南非1名、中國5名。這8名病患中，目前有一半還在生存期。\n目前，福建患兒的家屬謝絕媒體采訪，不過近日他們發帖稱，已經與相關藥企取得聯係，但該藥在國內還處於臨床試驗階段，而且隻針對成人。“想推動申請的事宜，但還沒想好該怎麽做。”\n專家建議夏天避免去天然水域遊泳\n複旦大學附屬華山醫院感染科副主任王新宇曾表示：“在中國，‘食腦蟲’（感染）屬於罕見事件，感染概率極低，一年到頭全國也難得見到幾例，感染者中多見幼兒、青少年群體。如果得了這種疾病，一旦（蟲體）進腦，病死率很高，發病後病情常在一周內迅速惡化。”\n“食腦蟲”通常通過鼻腔進入大腦，引起腦實質損害。據央視網\n目前針對這種疾病的治療效果如何？王新宇說，國內有搶救成功的報道，醫生會根據患者情況，通過多種藥物聯合作用、控製顱內壓等手段挽救患者生命。關鍵還是在於早發現、早治療。\n據報道，2022年，浙江大學醫學院附屬兒童醫院感染科曾收治了一例阿米巴原蟲感染患兒，經過醫生們兩個月左右的精心治療，患兒最終脫離了生命危險，回歸正常生活。\n另一個病例中的患者則沒有這麽幸運。據報道，國家傳染病醫學中心、複旦大學附屬華山醫院感染科曾收治一個15歲的孩子，他常在家鄉貴州的河塘中遊泳，感染了狒狒阿米巴原蟲，最終搶救無效去世。\n暑假到了，不少家長會帶著孩子去海邊遊玩或是去遊泳。對此，浙江大學醫學院附屬兒童醫院感染科主任黃麗素表示，雖然感染阿米巴原蟲是小概率事件，但家長還是要注意，夏天是“食腦蟲”感染的相對高發期。“預防方式是前往經過消毒處理，含氯的正規泳池，避免去湖泊、溪流等天然水域‘野泳’。”\n美國疾病預防控製中心官網稱，福氏耐格裏阿米巴原蟲存在於所有溫暖的淡水中，包括湖泊、池塘、河流、溫泉等，應盡量避免在這些水域中遊泳，或在遊泳時，頭部始終高於水麵、戴上鼻夾。避免擾動湖泊或池塘沉積層，這裏麵可能生存著大量病原體。“食腦蟲”隻能在淡水中生存，迄今未發現經由海水感染的病例。",

    "title": "More Companies Seeking to Turn Athletes into Corporate Assets",
    "text": "このページを\n日本語 で読む\nLabor shortages are worsening due to declining births and an aging population. Meanwhile, companies are increasingly looking to retired athletes as a potential talent pool for corporate roles.\nData shows that more than 80% of professional athletes retire from competition by the age of 30. The same is true of those aspiring to become professionals. While some stay involved in sports after retirement, many choose corporate careers as a practical next step. Many companies are eager to leverage this pool of talent.\nRetired athletes often face criticism for lacking general knowledge. This is because their singular focus on sports during their years as active athletes limits the development of other skill sets. Building robust support systems will likely be key to ensuring their success as valuable corporate contributors.\nMaking the Connections\nIn September, the Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI), a think tank, and the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry held an event in Osaka. It was their first attempt to connect active and retired professional athletes seeking employment with general businesses. Eleven athletes, including baseball players dressed in uniforms and jerseys, participated. They listened attentively to company representatives' presentations, their nervousness apparent.\nAdditionally, the event sought to address the uncertainty many athletes feel about their post-retirement careers while also helping companies tackle labor shortages. Nine organizations participated, including Daiwa House Group, Tsuruya Golf (Osaka), and several small and medium-sized enterprises from the Osaka region.\nFollowing an introduction to their operations and hiring practices, the companies conducted interviews. These interviews allowed athletes to present the skills they developed through sports. Participating companies expressed optimism about hiring athletes. Qualities such as \"perseverance and competitiveness honed through sports\" and their suitability for sales roles strongly appealed to the companies.\nFocusing on New Skill Sets\nHowever, some athletes voiced concerns after speaking with hiring managers. They feared they \"might be rejected due to a lack of academic qualifications,\" even if they applied to a company.\nFueled by the enthusiasm of companies eager to secure talent, the event was an overall success. Some companies indicated they were considering hiring athletes. Nonetheless, there were critical assessments of the athletes' readiness for corporate roles. One organizer noted, \"These athletes certainly do lack business skills. Despite the companies enthusiastically explaining their points, hardly anyone was taking notes.\"\nMRI's Athlete FLAP Support\nLast spring, MRI launched the Athlete FLAP Support Service, designed to help athletes transition into corporate roles. The service registers both current and former athletes, along with companies and municipalities interested in hiring them.\nMRI identified \"the separation of vocational education and athletic training as a key challenge\" and developed programs to bridge this gap. Its programs include self-analysis and career development training essential for job hunting. Those steps are followed by matching athletes with potential employers.\nMRI's Athlete FLAP initiative reflects its vision for career autonomy and is built around four key steps:\n- Identifying personal traits, strengths, and suitable career paths.\n- Acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve career goals.\n- Taking decisive steps toward employment.\n- Succeeding in a new phase of life.\nAs an MRI representative explained, this four-step process is crucial for athletes. Through this initiative, they will learn to translate their sports-honed abilities into the job market and thrive beyond their athletic careers.\nUnlocking Athletes' Potential\nThe think tank identified several challenges that led to the launch of its Athlete FLAP Support Service. Labor shortages and mismatches between workforce supply and demand were among the issues. Additionally, the lack of diversity in corporate talent contributed to a shortage of innovation. MRI's representative highlighted athletes as a largely untapped resource. While many possess strong business skills, their opportunities to excel in the corporate sector remain limited.\nIn August, the Osaka-based IT company Raxus conducted a survey. Its survey targeted men and women aged 20 to 50 who had become, or aspired to become, professional athletes after finishing school. Results showed that 85.1% of athletes retired from competition between the ages of 20 and 30.\nMoreover, 80% of respondents reported engaging in job hunting after retiring. When asked about their post-retirement career concerns, common responses included, \"Can I even find a job?\" Another frequent worry was, \"Will I discover something I can dedicate myself to with the same passion I had for my sport?\"\nFurthermore, the survey also noted a tradition in the sports world. Coaches and managers often assist retiring athletes by introducing them to companies or job opportunities.\nRaxus' survey further examined the skills athletes believed could be applied to business settings after retirement. \"A strong desire to achieve goals\" was the skill they most frequently cited (35.6%). \"Perseverance\" (32.1%) and \"interpersonal communication\" (30.4%) were the second and third most cited.\nAre Companies Willing to Invest?\nThe OCCI has long championed \"industry development centered around sports\" through its flagship initiative, Sports Hub KANSAI. OCCI's program connects athletes and sports teams with companies to foster product development and create new business opportunities. Building on this foundation, the OCCI has partnered with the MRI to expand the initiative further.\nShingo Torii, Chairman of OCCI and Vice Chairman of Suntory Holdings, praised the unique qualities athletes bring to the table. \"People who excel in sports or other specialized fields possess something exceptional,\" he stated.\nTorii also stressed the importance of businesses and the broader economic community actively tapping into this talent pool. \"From the perspective of workforce mobility, it's only natural for companies to welcome athletes,\" he added.\nHowever, Yuichiro Takigawa, from the Kansai Branch Information Department of Tokyo Shoko Research, pointed out key challenges. \"Many athletes have little to no practical work experience,\" he explained. \"Training them from scratch requires both manpower and capital. Companies will need to demonstrate a willingness to invest upfront and have the resources to support such efforts.\"\nDespite these challenges, Mitsuo Fujiyama, Director of the Kansai Economic Research Center at the Japan Research Institute, expressed optimism. \"A lot of professional sports teams are deeply rooted in their local communities,\" he noted. \"If athletes from these teams can build second careers with local companies, it could drive regional revitalization.\"\nRELATED:\nWhy Japan's Mass Recruitment of New Graduates Needs to ChangeEDITORIAL | Japan's Record-Low Fertility Rate Needs Decisive Intervention\nAuthor: Kohei Inoue\nこのページを\n日本語 で読む",

    "text": "[English News](/attualita/english-news/)\nPedestrian Sundays return and the city will see a reduction in cars\nThe administration is also evaluating measures to encourage alternative forms of heating and reduce emissions from construction sites\nKey points:\n- Milan aims to reduce private road transport by 50% by 2030.\n- The city is considering the return of car-free Sundays.\n- The administration is also evaluating measures to encourage alternative forms of heating and reduce emissions from construction sites.\nMilan declares war on smog. Palazzo Marino, as announced by the Environment Councillor Elena Grandi in a long press conference on Wednesday, intends to seriously fight the battle against pollution. Three major measures are on the horizon: the return of car-free Sundays, a sharp reduction in the number of cars circulating in the city, and more space - much more space - for bicycles and non-polluting vehicles. \"First of all, we need to act on mobility. In Milan, we aim to reduce private road transport by 50% by 2030 and make the city a cycling and pedestrian city by 2050,\" Grandi announced. At the moment, \"more than 600,000 cars enter Milan every day.\" A problem, Grandi continued, which \"concerns public transport on rails and investments at national and regional level, all directed towards road transport.\" \"If these resources had been invested in rail transport, we would not have municipal employees who take 2 and a half hours to get home. Not to mention that we don't even know where to park all these cars.\"\nSo, the watchword is: action. And the first step could be car-free Sundays. \"We are doing a good job of thinking about this, thanks also to our city councillors from Europa Verde, Councillor Censi and the mayor. We are in a study phase to understand how to spread them out and experiment with areas where we can organize car-free Sundays in a scattered way,\" the councillor announced. \"They don't reduce particulate matter in one day,\" Grandi specified, \"but they have the function of transforming the vision of the city.\" Grandi also repeatedly called on the region, asking for the establishment of a technical table on the issue of smog. \"We believe that the Move-In must be reduced at a regional level. We have already reduced it at a municipal level and we are evaluating together with Councillor Censi and the mayor how to reduce it further,\" Grandi said about the possibility of reducing the mileage that can be driven in the city, with a derogation from the pollution limits of Area B and Area C, for cars with a black box installed. And again, always with the Pirellone in mind: \"I believe that it is no longer time to give incentives to those who buy diesel, petrol and combustion cars. In fact, perhaps no one should be given incentives at all.\"\nBut it's not just about cars. At the municipal level, the administration is in fact evaluating the introduction of measures to encourage alternative forms of heating, such as geothermal and photovoltaic: \"For two years now, we have no longer had oil-fired boilers in Milan. We need to think about the great potential of a city that floats on water. We are working with the offices, the management and other departments on how to incentivize geothermal energy, which will and must become a resource.\" The councillor then also touched on the issue of construction sites: \"I think of clean construction, of zero emissions not only in the built environment but also in the construction process.\" In short, anything to reduce smog because \"the problem is too serious, people are dying,\" Grandi concluded. \"There are children with chronic bronchitis and elderly people who die 5 years before their time. We have to take charge of this.\"",

    "text": "Blades sign Alberta U18 AAA scoring leader Halat to WHL Scholarship and Development agreement\nSaskatoon, SK – The Saskatoon Blades are happy to announce the signing of 2009-born forward Adam Halat to a Western Hockey League (WHL) Scholarship and Development agreement.\nThe Okotoks, AB product was acquired by the Blades on December 27, 2024 from the Calgary Hitmen in exchange for 19-year-old forward Lukas Hansen.\n“Adam has dynamic skill, soft hands, and high-end offensive creativity,” said Blades director of scouting, Dan Tencer, “He’s a guy that you can count on to make everyone around him better. He’s one of those guys that you know will bring that down the line in a WHL uniform because he competes with everything he has and isn’t afraid of pressure or big moments.”\nHalat is the leading scorer in the Alberta Elite Hockey U18 AAA League (AEHL) as a member of the Okotoks Oilers. The left-handed shot is averaging just under a goal-per-game as a 15-year-old rookie, owning 23 goals and 45 points in 26 games. Halat is tied with 2008-born Blades prospect Kohen Lodge for the most points-per-game in Alberta U18 AAA at 1.73.\nThe Blades want to welcome the Halat family to the organization and city of Saskatoon, and look forward to working with Adam under the guidance of head coach Dan DaSilva’s staff.",
