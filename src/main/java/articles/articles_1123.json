    "title": "ROMERÍA VIRGEN DEL ROCÍO | Devoción con la Virgen del Rocío en el Pantano de Elche",
    "text": "Honores a la Blanca Paloma en el Pantano de Elche La Virgen del Rocío está custodiada en el paraje natural entre romeros y esta madrugada se dará uno de los momentos más especiales con el salto de la reja ¡Viva la Blanca Paloma! ¡Viva! Son los vítores que más se escucharon este viernes con una romería histórica que desde la parroquia del Corazón de Jesús hasta el Pantanto de [Elche](https://www.informacion.es/elche/) afloró el fervor de los devotos a la Virgen del Rocío. La imagen ha pasado su primera noche en la explanada del paraje natural y está previsto que en la madrugada del domingo se suceda el tradicional acto del salto de la reja y la procesión a partir de la 01:00 horas. Será ya este domingo a partir de las 17 horas cuando la Virgen regrese al templo sagrado pero antes son muchas las muestras de cariño en forma de baile y cante hacia la Reina de las Marismas que este año, y como ocurre cada siete años viste con atuendos típicos de una pastora. Este sábado, por ejemplo, y antes de la lluvia de primera hora tuvo lugar el Rosario de la Aurora, a las 6 horas, y ha tenido lugar un paseo de caballos por el recinto entre las diferentes carpas donde se veían vecinas ataviadas con sus mejores trajes de rociera al son de música flamenca. La ciudad lleva acogiendo esta romería organizada por la Comunidad Andaluza de Elche más de tres décadas, en concreto es la edición número 33 y los actos conmemorativos arrancaron el 25 de mayo con el pregón a cargo de Jonatan Sandoval Alarcón, pitero de la Romería desde hace 35 años. El 27, 28 y 29 de mayo se realizó un triduo a la Virgen en la misma parroquia. Misa rociera Ya este viernes se presentaron los simpecados, la liturgia y se bendijo a todos los peregrinos a partir desde las 16 horas, media hora antes de que partiese el cortejo. A la llegada al pantano, se cantó la salve Rociera, uno de los momentos más emocionantes. Está previsto que esta tarde, a las 20:00 horas, se realice la misa rociera cantada por el coro Gramaseca, a las 21:00 horas se hará un homenaje con el grupo Ecos de Andalucía y finalizará con la actuación en directo del Grupo Candela a partir de las 22.30 horas. Este año el cuadro que ilustra la agenda de actos, está realizado por María Jesús Costa, socia de la Casa de Andalucía de Elche, donde ha querido homenajear a la figura del rociero ilicitano con figuras representativas de la ciudad con la técnica de acuarela.

    "title": "Families From All Over The World Gathered Together For The 2024 Family Weekend Event",
    "text": "On Feb. 16 and 17, John Brown University organized its annual Family Weekend event, offering the student body of JBU the perfect opportunity to invite their families and friends to enjoy various activities during the weekend. From Texas to El Salvador, the University campus served as the host to a large number of families from diverse places. Some of the activities offered by JBU and leadership groups included a special chapel service to hear from President Dr. Charles Pollard, a basketball game and the cherry on the cake, a night full of competition and talent. On Friday morning, families gathered at the Cathedral of the Ozarks to receive a warm welcome from Chip Pollard. This welcoming also served as an extra chapel credit for those students who attended. The atmosphere was brimming with devotion as everyone was praising the Lord in one voice. Additionally, the families who joined the chapel service experienced the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness President Pollard’s dancing skills, provoking laughs and enjoyment among them. The President of The Student Government Association, Gustavo Maida, shared his parents’ thoughts about this gathering: “My parents are truly impressed by the way that the President engages with the students and the way that students treat him.” After the chapel service concluded, parents had the opportunity to witness their children’s classes, which allowed them to experience a bit of their children’s daily college routine. Maida, whose parents originate from El Salvador and traveled from there, shared: “They were really impressed since universities in El Salvador do not offer these kinds of opportunities.” Freshman Elementary Education major, Ainsley Bean, said: “My parents liked the experience, I also brought my siblings.” Besides, she shared with us the abrupt change in the JBU cafeteria’s menu: “I did notice that the food was really good on Friday”. Additionally, Freshman Art and Illustration major, Grace Stromberg, included: “My parents came from Dallas, Texas. I did not invite them to any of my classes, but I know they enjoyed the student’s gallery a lot, just being able to see all the student’s art.” Opinions might differ, but the vast majority of them agree that parents had a pleasant time on campus, including their experience at the cafeteria. On Saturday afternoon, families had the chance to cheer on the JBU’s Basketball Team as they played against Texas Wesleyan University’s team, the “RAMS”. The game was a great opportunity for the families to spend quality time together as it was full of emotions. The game ended up with a victory for the JBU’s team. Indeed, Saturday was a busy day as it was full of activities. From 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., John Brown University’s Student Events and Activities hosted the 2024 Talent Show event. This was a great opportunity for JBU students to share what makes them unique. It was, without a doubt, a magical night where students sang, danced and even played instruments. Junior international business and entrepreneurship, Lila Lemus, shared her experience being on stage: “It was an experience that my heart needed. Being able to perform again after many years was a huge blessing. I am so grateful for being able to share a part of my life and my talent with the people that I care for.” Lemus also expressed her amazement as she looked out from the stage and saw the Cathedral filled with families. Stromberg also shared her family’s experience at the talent show: “We did go to the talent show and they all really enjoyed it! They had a lot of fun seeing the different acts and just seeing everyone’s talent.” Right after the Talent Show came to an end, an “after party” was waiting for the families and the participants at Walker Student Center. There were snacks of all kinds such as nachos, pretzels, popcorn, gummies and sodas for everyone to enjoy. Undoubtedly, there was no better way to conclude such a night than with a booster of sugar! Family Weekend 2024 was, once again, an absolute success, as families gathered to share JBU’s values and practices. Photo courtesy of John Brown University Communications",

    "text": "Nikki Sixx Shares Sad News On Mötley Crüe’s Tour Plans\nIn a new tweet on his official X account, Nikki Sixx revealed a sad update on Mötley Crüe’s tour schedule.\n“How are you doing?” a fan asked the bassist in a Q&A session. Sixx replied, “Thank you for asking. Me and Courtney [Sixx] are really busy between all our business’s and our daughter. Nice to be off the road til next year.”\nMötley Crüe announced in September that they would perform shows at The Roxy, Troubadour, and Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles. The band had three exclusive, intimate club shows at Hollywood’s Sunset Strip on October 7, October 9, and October 11.\nThe three club shows happened after the release of Mötley Crüe’s ‘Cancelled’ EP on October 4. The EP, their first with Big Machine, has three new songs: ‘Dogs Of War,’ ‘Fight For Your Right,’ a cover of the Beastie Boys’ song, and the title track ‘Cancelled.’\nThe band made [a surprise appearance](https://rockcelebrities.net/motley-crue-gets-dumped-back-out-in-a-trash-truck-at-first-night-of-hollywood-takeover/) at the Troubadour on October 8 for their Hollywood Takeover. They shared a video on social media of a trash truck pulling up to the venue and unloading trash, only for the band members to jump out.\nThey captioned the clip, “Mötley Crüe gets dumped back out in a trash truck on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood for night 1 of the HÖLLYWOOD TAKEÖVER!”\nMötley Crüe also reminded fans about a charity auction with instruments used on stage, each signed by the band. The money raised went to Covenant House International.\nThough the Hollywood Takeover was meant to go back to basics, Mötley Crüe still played their usual hit songs at the Troubadour. The 16-song set included classics like ‘Primal Scream,’ ‘Shout at the Devil,’ and ‘Kickstart My Heart,’ along with newer songs like ‘Dogs of War’ and a cover of the Beastie Boys’ ‘Fight For Your Right.’\nMötley Crüe’s deal with Big Machine brings them back together after working on the 2014 album ‘Nashville Outlaws: A Tribute To Mötley Crüe.’ Big Machine also worked with Mötley Crüe’s new guitarist John 5 on his 2021 album ‘Sinner.’ Crüe’s last studio album was ‘Saints Of Los Angeles’ in 2008.\nThank you for asking. Me and\n[@how2girl]are really busy between all our business’s and our daughter. Nice to be off the road til next year.[https://t.co/sUiqNfdCeb]— 📷 (@NikkiSixx)\n[November 21, 2024]",

    "title": "Tips on keeping your AC unit at peak performance",
    "text": "Tips on keeping your AC unit at peak performance SHERMAN, Texas (KXII) - The long, hot month of August is approaching, meaning more work for your AC unit. “Your HVAC system is the most expensive appliance in your home and it utilizes the most amount of energy so one thing you want to do is one, it’s costly to repair, it’s costly to replace so doing your routine performance maintenance on your HVAC system is crucial, especially with this Texas Heat because it definitely puts it through its paces,” said Dana Bacon, the general manage of Crazy AC Guy. Crazy AC Guy has been serving Texomans for 16 years, they’ve stayed busy this summer partly due to a lack of consistency in caring for their AC unit. Bacon said you should have your system cleaned by a professional every six months. “When you have a dirty condensing coil or a dirty evaporator coil or a dirty filter on your HVAC system, it causes that system to work so much harder and it decreases your capacity, but it also increases your utility [usage, so](http://usage.so) it’s costing more to operate to be less comfortable.” Also make sure the condensing unit isn’t restricted anyway, by dirt or items or it’ll burn more energy, and keep the grass around it cut. “Basically how an air conditioner works, it’s absorbing the heat inside your home and releasing it outside. And if it’s restricted, if there’s an overhang over the top of the unit, it’s recirculating all that hot air that is discharged, it’s going to cause your amp draw and your compressor to work harder and it’s going to run hotter. So it’s going to burn more energy. And also if the coil is dirty and restricted, that also will cause the same scenario... [You] definitely wanna keep the grass clear around the condensing unit. You also wanna keep any dogs from urinating on the condenser because that will deteriorate the coil and lose efficiency and end up causing it to leak refrigerant,” said Bacon. Bacon said the best temperature to keep your thermostat on is 76 to 78 degrees when you’re away from home. If your AC isn’t working, Bacon said to first check your breakers and filter, then check your thermostat to make sure it’s set for cooling, and the indoor and outdoor fan to see if it’s moving air. If you can’t find the problem at that point, call a professional. Copyright 2024 KXII. All rights reserved.",
