    "text": "Desde hace meses, la salud de Yolanda Andrade se ha visto mermada a causa de un aneurisma cerebral que le fue detectado hace meses y que le ha ocasionado fuertes síntomas que la han llevado a ausentarse de las pantallas por periodos largos, razón por la que decidió hablar al respecto, sincerandose con la audiencia.\nEl pasado abril, la famosa tuvo que ser hospitalizada de emergencia debido a un intenso dolor de cabeza y otros síntomas alarmantes que le han impedido hacer su vida con normalidad, sin notar mucha mejoría a pesar del tratamiento médico que lleva, algo que la ha llevado a sospechar que podría ser víctima de brujería.\n¿Qué es una aneurisma cerebral, condición que afecta a Yolanda Andrade? La famosa reveló, en principio que sufría de un aneurisma cerebral, una condición en la que se forma un punto débil en una arteria del cerebro que se hincha y llena de sangre, ejerciendo presión sobre los nervios o el tejido cerebral, debido a ello se ha sometido a un doloroso tratamiento para recuperar su salud.\nAl haber experimentado complicaciones de salud de forma repentina, la famosa ha comenzado a sospechar que su enfermedad, más allá de ser un tema físico, podría igualmente tratarse de brujería, es decir que alguien le realizará un ‘trabajo’ para afectarla.\nYolanda Andrade cree que es víctima de brujería Durante una entrevista con el programa ‘Primer Impacto’, la conductora mencionó que, tras reflexionar sobre su situación, no puede encontrar una explicación lógica para su repentino aneurisma y esto la ha hecho considerar la posibilidad de que alguien esté buscando perjudicarla con un ‘trabajo’.\n“Tuve unos episodios muy extraños porque me empezaron a decir: ‘Tú tienes un trabajo, una brujería’, un no sé qué, un hechizo. Fíjate que no fue así de que fui con el curandero para que me dé el remedio de eso (…) “(Me ayudaron) las misas, el creer en Dios, el no estar pensando en eso, mi fe, la Virgen de Guadalupe… En serio, ¿Qué habré hecho yo para que alguien deseara mi muerte?”, fue lo que dijo la famosa.\n​\n​\n​\n​",

    "text": "Researchers say climate change-induced changes in the weather may have dire effects on mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in island nations.\nThey found while there's sufficient evidence to support the link between the changing climate and MBD, globally, there is still a lack of understanding about precisely what that impact will be in small island states vulnerable to climate-induced health crises.\nMohabeer Teeluck, a doctoral researcher at James Cook University's Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, led the study.\nHe said by the end of the 21st century, it's projected the global mean annual temperature will rise substantially above pre-industrial levels.\n\"This means there will be drastic changes in meteorological variables, which will likely have an implication for the proliferation of disease vectors such as mosquitoes.\n\"The World Health Organisation says that between 2030 and 2050, an additional 250,000 deaths will be attributed to climate sensitive diseases such as water-borne and vector-borne diseases,\" said Mr Teeluck.\nHe said the team conducted an analysis of studies to determine what connection they showed between weather and the frequency and transmission of MBD outbreaks in small islands with vulnerable public health systems.\n\"It's important we know exactly what risks small, less-developed nations face from inevitable climate changes. Both from a humanitarian perspective and, given the interconnectedness of the globe, from a self-preservation perspective too,\" said Mr Teeluck.\nHe said the relative risk of MBDs increased with temperature in 72% of the studies and rainfall enhanced dengue transmission in 84% of the studies.\n\"All the research discussing the effect of increasing humidity illustrated a similar trend of increasing MBDs, but increased wind speed tended to reduce MBDs,\" said Mr Teeluck.\nHe said local effects were extremely variable, with MBD transmission actually decreasing with some combinations of temperature, rainfall and humidity.\n\"Lab studies have shown that there is a complex interplay between meteorological variables and MBDs and therefore findings are likely to be highly specific to the local conditions in the study region,\" said Mr Teeluck.\nHe said the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the shortcomings of developing island nations' public health systems and researchers believe they would struggle to respond to disease outbreaks.\n\"The limitations of the studies and the non-linear relationship between weather conditions and MBD outbreaks accentuates the need for conducting further studies and predicting local effects - if we want to get on top of MBDs in these nations before they are out of control,\" said Mr Teeluck.\nhere.",

    "text": "SNOWMASS, Colo. – It’s been nearly three decades since U.S. Army Veteran Brent King and his Spokane VA Healthcare System Recreational Therapist Vance Pease first met. This year, both men returned to Snowmass to participate in the 38th annual National Disabled Veteran Winter Sports Clinic, both professionally and personally as friends. “My introduction to the Winter Sports Clinic came by way of the then chief of prosthetics for the Spokane VA Medical Center, who was a triple-amputee Marine Corps Veteran,” King shared. “Even though I was hesitant about attending, he told me I was going; that push was the best thing that could have happened to me.” King, who served from 1988 to 1995, experienced his first major injury after surviving an 18-foot fall during a training exercise. Then, 18-years after the initial injury, bone infections led to the painful decision to amputate both of his legs. “At first, I was consumed by self-pity and I had a pretty bad attitude,” King, who is a member of the DAV chapter in North Idaho, said. “Then I went to my first Winter Sports Clinic and everyone – from the staff to the Veterans – was happy. Being in that environment really motivated me and from there, I just changed my attitude.” A successful mortgage broker and general contractor, King credits the adaptive sports event with changing his life for the better. He currently serves as the executive director for the northwest chapter of the American Paralyzed Veterans of America. “I’m really grateful for everyone who makes this event possible,” said King. “The Winter Sports Clinic could not function smoothly without the support it receives from the volunteers, donors, and VA staff.” That last category is a group King is particularly grateful for and, according to Pease, the feeling is mutual. “Working with Brent has been incredible. The example he sets for other Veterans is profound and seeing the impact he has reinforces what I know to be true about the VA,” Pease shared. “Events like the Winter Sports Clinic prove that there are people who can face adversity and get back to seeking true enjoyment, what is meaningful, and what gives them purpose.”",

    "text": "Decoding the Brown Tip Mystery: What Your Plant’s Leaves Are Telling You Brown tips on plant leaves are a very common issue, and they’re essentially a distress signal. Typically, brown leaf tips indicate a problem with the plant’s environment or care routine, not necessarily a disease . They are often a sign of stress, and the browning is the plant’s way of sacrificing that part of the leaf to conserve resources and protect the rest of itself. The specific cause can vary, and diagnosing it requires a bit of detective work, considering factors like watering habits, humidity, soil conditions, and even the type of water you’re using. Understanding the potential culprits is the first step toward reviving your verdant friends.\nUnraveling the Causes of Brown Leaf Tips The frustrating truth is that several factors can lead to those unwelcome brown tips. Here’s a breakdown of the most common causes:\nWatering Issues: This is usually the primary suspect. Both overwatering and underwatering can cause brown tips. Overwatering leads to root rot , which prevents the plant from absorbing water properly, effectively starving the leaves. Underwatering, on the other hand, directly deprives the leaves of the moisture they need. The key is consistent soil moisture – neither bone dry nor constantly soggy.\nLow Humidity: Many houseplants, especially tropical varieties, thrive in humid environments. Dry air can cause the leaf tips to dry out and turn brown.\nExcessive Fertilizer: Over-fertilizing can lead to a buildup of salts in the soil . These salts can damage the roots and interfere with water absorption, resulting in brown tips.\nPoor Water Quality: Tap water often contains chlorine, fluoride, and other minerals that can be harmful to plants, especially sensitive species. The accumulation of these substances can lead to salt damage, manifesting as brown edges and tips. The Environmental Literacy Council provides valuable resources regarding water quality and its impact on ecosystems, highlighting the importance of understanding water composition for both environmental and horticultural health, accessible at enviroliteracy.org.\nSunlight: Both too much and too little sunlight can cause browning. Too much direct sun can scorch the leaves, while insufficient light can weaken the plant and make it more susceptible to other problems.\nPhysical Damage or Pests: While less common, physical damage to the leaves or pest infestations can also contribute to browning, as they stress the plant and affect its ability to function properly.\nDiagnosis: Becoming a Plant Detective To accurately diagnose the cause of your plant’s brown tips, you need to investigate. Start by considering these questions:\nWhat’s my watering schedule? Am I consistently overwatering or underwatering? Check the soil moisture regularly. What’s the humidity level in the room? Is it particularly dry, especially during the winter months? How often am I fertilizing? Am I using the correct type and amount of fertilizer? What type of water am I using? Is it tap water, and if so, do I let it sit out overnight to allow chlorine to evaporate? What’s the light exposure like? Is the plant getting too much direct sunlight, or not enough light in general? Have I noticed any signs of pests? Check the leaves and stems carefully for insects or other infestations. Is there physical damage to the leaves? Solutions: Restoring Your Plant’s Health Once you’ve identified the likely cause, you can take steps to correct the problem:\nAdjust Watering: If you’re overwatering, let the soil dry out completely before watering again. If you’re underwatering, water thoroughly until water drains from the bottom of the pot. Adjust your watering schedule based on the plant’s needs and the environmental conditions.\nIncrease Humidity: Use a humidifier, pebble tray, or mist the plant regularly to increase humidity. Grouping plants together can also help create a more humid microclimate.\nReduce Fertilization: Reduce the frequency and amount of fertilizer you’re using. Consider flushing the soil by watering thoroughly several times to remove excess salts.\nUse Filtered Water: If tap water is the culprit, switch to filtered water or let tap water sit out for 24 hours to allow chlorine to evaporate. Rainwater is also an excellent option.\nAdjust Light Exposure: Move the plant to a location with appropriate light exposure. If it’s getting too much direct sun, move it to a shadier spot. If it’s not getting enough light, move it closer to a window or use a grow light.\nAddress Pests: If you find any pests, treat the plant with an appropriate insecticide or other pest control method.\nTrim Brown Tips: While the brown tips won’t turn green again, you can trim them off carefully with clean scissors to improve the plant’s appearance. Cut at an angle, following the natural shape of the leaf.\nPrevention: Keeping Your Plants Happy Preventing brown tips is always easier than treating them. Here are some tips for keeping your plants healthy and happy:\nResearch your plants: Understand the specific needs of each plant, including its watering, humidity, light, and fertilizer requirements. Use well-draining soil: This will help prevent overwatering and root rot. Monitor your plants regularly: Check the soil moisture, humidity levels, and leaves for signs of problems. Adjust your care routine as needed: Environmental conditions can change, so be prepared to adjust your care routine accordingly. Don’t be afraid to experiment: Every plant is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the perfect care routine. FAQs: Decoding the Brown Tip Enigma 1. Do brown tips always mean I’m doing something wrong? Not necessarily! Sometimes, environmental factors beyond your control (like a sudden drop in humidity) can cause brown tips. The key is to assess the situation and make adjustments as needed.\n2. Will the brown tips turn green again if I fix the problem? Unfortunately, no. Once a leaf tip turns brown, it won’t revert to green. You can trim the brown part off to improve the plant’s appearance.\n3. Can I just ignore the brown tips? While a few brown tips might not be a cause for immediate alarm, ignoring them can lead to more serious problems. It’s best to address the underlying cause to prevent further damage.\n4. How often should I mist my plants? The frequency of misting depends on the plant and the humidity level. Plants that prefer high humidity may benefit from daily misting, while others may only need it once or twice a week.\n5. What’s the best way to increase humidity? Several methods can increase humidity, including using a humidifier, placing plants on a pebble tray filled with water, grouping plants together, or misting regularly.\n6. Is it better to underwater or overwater plants? It’s generally better to underwater than overwater. Overwatering can lead to root rot, which is often fatal. Underwatering is easier to correct.\n7. What are the signs of root rot? Signs of root rot include yellowing or browning leaves, wilting, stunted growth, and a foul odor coming from the soil.\n8. How can I tell if I’m over-fertilizing? Signs of over-fertilizing include white crust on the soil surface, brown leaf tips, and stunted growth.\n9. Can I use tap water on all my plants? Tap water is generally safe for most plants, but some sensitive species may prefer filtered water or rainwater. Let tap water sit out overnight to allow chlorine to evaporate.\n10. What type of fertilizer should I use? The type of fertilizer you use depends on the plant’s needs. Choose a fertilizer that’s specifically formulated for houseplants, and follow the instructions on the label.\n11. How often should I water my air plants? Air plants should be soaked in water for 10-20 minutes every week or two. In between soakings, mist them regularly to keep them hydrated.\n12. Why are the tips of my leaves on my air plant turning brown? Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water? Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered. Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it.\n13. What does an overwatered air plant look like? Signs of an Overwatered Air Plant: If the center leaves are falling out, or the base of the plant begins to turn black or brown, this is a sign that it’s beginning to rot from too much water.\n14. How do I know if I am over watering my plants? If a plant is overwatered, it will likely develop yellow or brown limp, droopy leaves as opposed to dry, crispy leaves (which are a sign of too little water). Wilting leaves combined with wet soil usually mean that root rot has set in and the roots can no longer absorb water.\n15. How do I know if my plants need water? Feel the soil: This is the easiest, most reliable, low-tech way to tell if your plant needs to be watered. Stick your finger in the soil 2-3 inches deep, and if it’s dry, your plant needs water.\nBy carefully observing your plants and addressing their needs, you can prevent brown tips and keep them thriving for years to come. Remember, plants communicate through their leaves, so listen carefully to what they’re telling you!",

    "text": "FRANKFURT: European shares declined on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision, with ongoing tensions in the Middle East adding to market uncertainty.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.4% down, at a near one-month low.\nThe hostilities between Iran and Israel extended to a sixth day, with fears of a more direct US involvement after President Donald Trump asked for Iran’s “unconditional surrender”.\nHowever, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump’s demand for surrender.\nDefence stocks were among the biggest gainers, with the sector up 0.6%.\nTraders also stayed away from risk assets ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting at 1800 GMT, where officials are widely expected to hold interest rates steady.\nInvestors will closely watch policymakers’ comments for signals on how the US central bank plans to navigate an uncertain trade environment.\n“Rising geopolitical and trade uncertainties mean the Fed’s growth and inflation forecasts may lack precision.”, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\nThe Fed faces additional challenges from potential inflation risks stemming from the escalating Middle East crisis.\nAs the July 8 tariff-pause deadline approaches, many countries, including the EU are scrambling to strike a deal with Washington. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was still aiming to reach a deal by July 9.\nThe only formal deal signed was the finalization of the US-UK agreement announced last month. Other major bourses indexes were largely mixed.\nLondon’s FTSE 100 closed up 0.1% after data showed that British inflation eased as expected in May. Investors are now eyeing the Bank of England’s rate decision on Thursday.\n“With services inflation still elevated... the BoE looks nailed on to keep rates unchanged,” said Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics.\nSweden’s central bank cut its key interest rate to 2.00% from 2.25% as expected. Still, Stockholm’s benchmark index dropped 0.1%.",

    "title": "Israel rejects calls for a 21-day Lebanon-border ceasefire and continues deadly airstrikes | SBS News",
    "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected proposals for a ceasefire with Hezbollah after the United States, Australia, European Union and several other countries called for a 21-day halt in the fighting that has alarmed Lebanon and raised fears of a ground invasion. Landing in the US to address the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu told reporters the military will keep hitting Lebanon with &quot;full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals&quot;. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz had earlier dismissed hopes of a ceasefire. &quot;We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,&quot; Katz said on Thursday in a statement on the social media platform X. Israel&apos;s stance has dashed hopes for a peaceful settlement after Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism that a ceasefire could be reached soon. Meanwhile, there was no let-up in violence. An Israeli warplane struck the edges of the capital Beirut, killing two people and wounding 15, including one woman critically, Lebanon&apos;s health ministry said on Thursday. That took deaths from hits overnight and during Thursday to 28. The strike killed the head of one of Hezbollah&apos;s air force units, Mohammad Surur, two security sources said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations hitting the group&apos;s top ranks. Earlier Israeli airstrikes had hit Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and ready-to-fire launchers, the Israeli military said on Thursday. In one deadly strike, at least 23 Syrians, most of them women and children, were killed when Israel hit a three-story building in the Lebanese town of Younine, the town&apos;s mayor, Ali Qusas, told Reuters. Lebanon is home to around 1.5 million Syrians who fled the civil war there. The Israeli military said dozens of Hezbollah targets were attacked, including terrorists, military buildings and weapons depots, in several areas on Thursday morning. Around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon towards the western Galilee area, some of which were intercepted, with the rest falling on open ground, said the Israeli military. On the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon, the army staged an exercise simulating a ground invasion &#x2014; a potential next stage after relentless airstrikes and explosions of communications devices. Israel&apos;s air force is planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran, air force commander Major General Tomer Bar said. Australia, the United States, the European Union and several Arab nations issued a joint call on Thursday for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah threatened to tip the Middle East into all-out war. &quot;We, therefore, have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border,&quot; US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint statement. The situation between Lebanon and Israel is &quot;intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation&quot;, according to the joint statement, which was signed by the US, Canada, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. &quot;This is in nobody&#x2019;s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon. &quot;It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety,&quot; they stated. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the call for a truce but said the key to its implementation was whether Israel, which has been moving troops closer to Lebanon, is committed to enforcing international resolutions. Asked if a ceasefire could be secured soon, Mikati told Reuters: &quot;Hopefully, yes.&quot; Earlier, Mikati called on the Security Council to put pressure on Israel for &quot;an immediate ceasefire on all fronts&quot;. Mikati&apos;s caretaker administration includes ministers chosen by Hezbollah, widely seen as the country&apos;s most powerful political force. On Thursday, the White House said discussions are continuing for a 21-day ceasefire and that US and Israeli officials would hold talks in New York. US secretary of state Antony Blinken was scheduled to meet with Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer. In London, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin warned there was a risk of all-out war in the Middle East but a diplomatic solution was still possible. &quot;So let me be clear, Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path, despite the sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable,&quot; Austin said. World leaders expressed concern that the conflict &#x2014; running in parallel to Israel&apos;s war in Gaza &#x2014; was escalating rapidly as the death toll in Lebanon rose past 600 and thousands fled their homes. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of missiles at targets in Israel, including its commercial hub Tel Aviv, although Israel&apos;s aerial defence system has ensured that the damage has been limited. Israel&apos;s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, told reporters before a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday that Israel would welcome a ceasefire and preferred a diplomatic solution. He then told the Security Council that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and that peace required dismantling the threat. Iran&apos;s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters before the council meeting that his country supported Hezbollah and would not remain indifferent if the conflict in Lebanon spiralled. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is currently in New York for the UN talks, said, &quot;Lebanon cannot become the next Gaza&quot;, saying it was the &quot;women and children who are paying the highest price&quot; in the cross-border conflict. &quot;This destructive cycle must stop, all parties must show restraint and de-escalate,&quot; Wong said. The French president said he was dispatching his foreign minister to Lebanon this week as part of efforts to stop war breaking out. &quot;There cannot be, must not be war in Lebanon,&quot; Macron said in his speech at the UN on Wednesday.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Coweta County, Georgia from 1901-2000 was 43.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Coweta County, Georgia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Coweta County, Georgia history.",
