    "title": "A startup that dubs videos to help creators reach their \"global potential\" has raised $8.5 million - Tubefilter",
    "text": "Language dubbing is becoming serious business for creators, and one startup that facilitates the translation process is cashing in. Linguana has raised $8.5 million in seed funding to scale up its YouTube-based operation.\nLinguana is led by Co-Founder and CEO Yuval Tal , an entrepreneur who previously established financial services firm Payoneer . His latest venture is also dedicated to money matters, but in a different way: Influencers have realized that they can greatly increase their viewership — and, by extension, their revenue — by dubbing their videos into multiple languages. Linguana is one company that makes global expansion a reality for its creative clients.\nYouTube has worked alongside creators like MrBeast to expand its first-party language dubbing tools . MrBeast continues to call for more robust translation tools across the social web. During a recent conversation with Mark Zuckerberg , he cited AI language dubbing as one of his most coveted features on Facebook .\nWith YouTube offering its own solutions for globetrotting creators, where does Linguana fit in? One of the startup’s biggest advantages is the accuracy and depth of its translations. Linguana CMO Jonny Steel told Business Insider that the company strives for “ultimate authenticity” to achieve a “higher quality of accuracy” than automated Google dubs.\n“We take high-performing YouTube videos, break them down into separate voice components, detect and remove advertisements, and adjust the video pacing to fit the target language,” Tal explained . “We then generate a voice similar to the original creator’s while preserving their tone and emotional expression, which is the hardest part. Our agreements are directly with the creators—all of their videos fall under our umbrella, and we pay them on a quarterly basis.”\nTal added that Linguana is growing 30% each month. With fresh funding in tow, the plan is to onboard more creators and invest in technology. Linguana already generates more than 10,000 translated videos each month for hundreds of clients, including notables like Charles Dowding and Nas Daily . Per the Linguana website , those dubs have resulted in more than ten million hours of added watch time.\nVideos in foreign languages have the potential to reach billions of viewers, especially in heavily populated regions like the Indian subcontinent . That’s good news for Linguana’s long-term prospects, but the company had to start out by speaking the universal language: Money. Participants in its seed round included angels Oren Zeev , Zohar Gilon , Eyal Waldman , and Oren Dobronsky as well as the early-stage firm 2LVC .",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump slammed Senate Majority Leader [Charles Schumer](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/charles-schumer) (D-NY) during an interview this week for abandoning his support for Israel, saying that the Democrat had “become like a Palestinian.” Trump made the remarks during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday night while talking about Israel’s war against Hamas. “They have to finish the job. Israel has to finish that job,” Trump said. “They have to finish it quickly, strongly, and they have to get back to life again because it’s taking too long. Gotta win, gotta win.” “The attack on October 7th, and it’s getting more and more demeaned, they’re demeaning it. I have people telling me they don’t think the attack ever happened,” Trump said in reference to modern day anti-Semitic Holocaust deniers. “And take a look, you watch the news reports — you watch these people on television and just like you have Holocaust deniers also, they say the Holocaust never happened. It’s the exact same people. They’re saying it never happened.” Trump noted that Israel used to have much more support in the U.S. among lawmakers, but lawmakers like the Squad — Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and others — have eroded that support. “I’m good,” Trump said about his support for Israel. “But they don’t have the backing. Even Schumer, he’s become like a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer, Jewish, always strong for Israel. He’s become like a Palestinian.” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) WATCH: Trump: Democrat Chuck Schumer has become so radical against Israel that “he’s become like a Palestinian” [pic.twitter.com/1YKbPqGlOT] — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) [June 6, 2024]",
