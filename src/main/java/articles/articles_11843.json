    "text": "EXPERT REACTION: Alcohol and gambling risks may be higher among NZ's pro rugby players\nSurvey: A study based solely on people’s responses to a series of questions.\nPeople: This is a study based on research using people.\nProfessional rugby players may have a higher risk of drinking and gambling problems compared to the general population, according to a survey of NZ men's Super Rugby players on mental health and lifestyle risks. Of the 105 players who responded, more than half were at moderate to high risk of alcohol harm, while the percentage of gamblers was about eight times higher than in the general population. 21% of players reported symptoms of depression, however, none met the criteria for depression. However, researchers say all of these risk factors may be underestimated since they were self-reported.\nJournal/conference: BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine\nOrganisation/s: Capital Sport Medicine, NZ; Axis Sports Medicine Specialists, NZ\nExpert Reaction\nThese comments have been collated by the Science Media Centre to provide a variety of expert perspectives on this issue. Feel free to use these quotes in your stories. Views expressed are the personal opinions of the experts named. They do not represent the views of the SMC or any other organisation unless specifically stated.\nDr Phillip Borell, Senior Lecturer (above the bar), University of Canterbury, comments:\nThose of us with connections into the world of professional sport will not be shocked by the findings of this research. However, a paper like this has the potential to shift the narrative regarding male professional athletes; specifically, those in such a visible sport as professional rugby union.\nThis research can illuminate the pitfalls of professional sport while also furthering current examinations of mental health among athletes. The research demonstrates that over one in five of all Super Rugby players in Aotearoa report symptoms of depression. This research will be challenging to a number of sport fans in this country. Though, not surprising in mental health and wellbeing advocacy circles.\nIt won’t be unsurprising to most that there are high rates of alcohol related harm in the elite sports scene. However, societal shifts have potentially also had an impact on what may have been a much higher rate 20 years ago.\nIn 2024 the focus on societal issues such as alcohol-related harm, gambling and mental health is far greater than it has ever been. However, for the public to see the extent of these impacts on their Super Rugby heroes has significant potential for further social change. I hope that this research can be a point of entry for further, and potentially deeper, illumination of elite athletes as people who share the same afflictions that so many of us ‘common folk’ do.\nNews for:\nNew Zealand\nMedia contact details for this story are only visible to registered journalists.",

    "text": "Israel pushed on Sunday with its military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attacks, as the focus of the deadly combat shifted to southern Gaza where most displaced Palestinians are trapped.\nUS President Joe Biden stressed the \"critical need\" to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would \"continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved\", officials said.\nAs heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the besieged Palestinian territory where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free remaining hostages.\nThe army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were lost in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side.\n\"This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\" said Netanyahu. \"The war is exacting a very heavy price... but we have no choice but to keep fighting.\"\nThe army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found \"explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents\".\nHamas rejected those claims as lies meant \"to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression that has affected the entire infrastructure... in the already blockaded Gaza Strip\".\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nThe gunmen also seized around 250 hostages, 129 of whom are believed to remain in Gaza following the exchange of captives for Palestinians prisoners during a week-long truce late last month.\nIsrael's withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.\nVast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.\nEighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents and forced into the south of Gaza even as ground fighting comes closer.\nNear the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu Al Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday.\n\"Who won?\" she said. \"Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians... They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.\"\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining operational control in northern Gaza and that now \"we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza\".\nFighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack.\nElsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir Al Balah.\n\"I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,\" said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. \"Rubble fell on us. I didn't know what happened.\"\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.\n\"For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.\"\nOn Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow \"immediate, safe and unhindered\" deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza \"at scale\".\nWorld powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington's insistence, toned down some provisions -- including removing a call for a ceasefire.\nOne displaced Gazan, Ahmad Al Burawi, now living in Rafah in southern Gaza, said: \"We just want to return to our lands, that's all. We want a solution... People are dying.\"\nChristmas Eve among war As the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born.\nBut this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego \"any unnecessarily festive\" celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans.\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark \"a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories\".",

    "title": "Why Are So Many People Calling Microsoft's Bing Wallpaper App Malware? - Dataconomy",
    "text": "Microsoft’s new Bing Wallpaper application has drawn significant criticism for including features that resemble malware behavior, leading to widespread concern among users. Released for Windows 10 and 11, the app automatically changes wallpapers daily but conceals multiple intrusive functionalities.\nSoftware engineer Rafael Rivera reported these findings, prompting conversations about user privacy and application integrity.\nThe Bing Wallpaper app, available on the Microsoft Store , is designed to enhance user experience with a rotating selection of images. However, it has come under scrutiny for its darker functionalities. Rivera’s analysis revealed that the application installs Bing Visual Search without user consent and prompts users to make Bing their default search engine across various browsers, including Firefox and Chrome.\nMoreover, the app incorporates code to “peruse and decrypt” cookies from browsers like Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, raising privacy concerns. It also accesses the geolocation web API, which likely collects location data without clear user notification.\nOn top of these invasive features, the application suggests making Microsoft Edge the default browser while actively launching tabs in other browsers that recommend activating a Microsoft Bing Search extension.\nUsers report intrusive behavior, such as recommendations to switch to Microsoft Edge and other apps published by Microsoft Rivera categorized Bing Wallpaper as employing several “nasty tricks” reminiscent of unwanted software. This discovery has led tech experts to label it a potentially unwanted program (PUP). Rivera’s findings have been substantiated by various reports, as several users express distrust towards the app’s intentions and functionality.\nThe backdrop to these accusations is not the first time Microsoft has come under fire for perceived privacy invasions. Similar concerns surfaced with the introduction of the Recall feature in Windows 11 , which captured screenshots of user activities for creating a searchable timeline. Although this feature has been confirmed as optional and uninstallable, the current situation surrounding the Bing Wallpaper app signals ongoing issues with privacy protections in Microsoft’s offerings.\nThe community hated the Bing Wallpaper app The online response has been largely negative, with many users advising against installing Bing Wallpaper. Rivera’s insights have prompted an array of discussions about the implications for user privacy and the increasingly invasive nature of formerly innocuous applications.\nCommentators have noted that such behavior is typically associated with malware, enhancing the feeling of distrust towards the application. Social media platforms echo the sentiment, as users vocalize their discomfort with the app’s hidden agendas.\nAs users navigate these concerns, it remains unclear how Microsoft will respond to the backlash. Investigations into the cloud behavior of Bing Wallpaper and the broader context of consumer protection are ongoing, highlighting potential risks associated with trusting software applications.\nThe tech community continues to advocate for transparency and user autonomy, emphasizing that users should maintain control over their software environments.",

    "title": "Addressing women's health through TCM and western medicine | Tatler Asia",
    "text": "Master Ruth Lee’s pivot to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) more than a decade ago came after 20 years in the advertising and marketing industry. The long hours and intensive lifestyle had started to take their toll and Lee was looking to make some changes. She found that TCM appealed. “It was because of its preventative approach; it [shouldn’t be] that you start to take care of yourself only when you have sickness or disease.”\nHaving studied TCM in Beijing, Lee now runs her own practice, Master Ruth TCM Clinic, in Hong Kong, with a focus on women’s health . She gets involved at all stages of a woman’s life, from first menstrual cycle to menopause and beyond, while specialising in fertility and IVF support , pre- and postnatal care, as well as offering facial acupuncture.\nDr Zara Chan is a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology at Hong Kong’s OT&P clinic, and treats women at similar stages to Lee, with a focus on pre- and postnatal care and treating women as they approach and experience menopause, at which point she is seeing an increasing number of women suffering from hormonal imbalances.\nSee also: From childbirth to postpartum: How women are reclaiming their bodies and power through natural birth, doulas and luxury confinement centres\nFor Chan, treatment for such hormonal disturbances can vary but she will often encourage women to visit a TCM practitioner, as acupuncture, medication and physical therapies can all help. She says that these treatments also “make the person’s body more sensitive to whatever I give them, which is good because it means I don’t have to give as high doses. Sometimes it could mean that instead of giving full-fledged hormone therapy, I can start them on certain types of hormonal supplements,” a gentler beginning to hormonal treatment.\nIt [shouldn’t be] that you start to take care of yourself only when you have sickness or disease\n- Master Ruth Lee -\nThere are other points in a woman’s life when Chan sees that TCM is beneficial. When women start planning to have children, she will often suggest TCM therapies for cycle regulation rather than using oral hormones, as she has seen that acupuncture and acupressure can have a positive impact. When women are pregnant, Chan might also propose TCM to address certain aches and pains, while acupuncture can solve a persistent breach.\nLee appreciates being able to use TCM therapies to complement western treatments. But a shift that she would like to see is towards a more preventative health approach. “I think this is one of the great advantages of Chinese medicine. We see the individual as a unique body, and we treat it with a personalised approach. It helps to lay a good foundation for prevention. For example, if you have period pain, it could be because of your body constitution. We can understand different body constitutions, so people have an awareness and respect their body’s differences; then you have a preventative approach. We can do a lot of things to help you better manage your health.\nSee also: How I learned to prioritise myself again: a journey to self-care\n“TCM approaches are already used in a lot of public health issues, such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes. In women’s health we want to do a lot more to help people understand that you can actually take a preventative approach instead of just a problem-solving approach.” She believes that such an approach from early on could help prevent some of the more prevalent conditions she is increasingly seeing in women, which include menstrual issues, fibroids and infertility, aside from a corresponding jump in mental health conditions.\nWhen we call it women’s health, it’s very easy for all women to take an interest and very easy for men to brush it aside\n- Dr Zara Chan -\nAs interest in women’s health increases and the topic becomes part of a wider conversation, Chan is particularly excited that the topic of menopause is finally being addressed. “Pregnancy as a whole gets a bit more attention [when it comes to women’s health], because you really can’t ignore the pregnant woman who’s going to take a couple of months off. Companies can’t ignore it, people can’t ignore it, families can’t ignore it and pregnancy is something that’s celebrated, whereas menopause really doesn’t get a good name for itself,” says Chan. She adds that there are plenty of ways to treat some of the more severe symptoms of menopause in order to manage it, such as exercise , diet and making some adjustments in terms of work. “Having a little bit of time off during the day to allow somebody to zone out and rest makes a huge difference for people going through those years—and it’s not forever that they have to do that,” she says. Such tweaks can have a huge impact not only on the women experiencing menopause, but also on their families.\nSee also: How to prepare for perimenopause\nBut the attention on women’s health needs to go further. “Women’s health needs to be addressed on a corporate level, especially in Hong Kong,” says Chan. One reason is that she believes menopausal symptoms and issues should be covered by insurance. “It’s almost like insurance companies just say that the symptoms you get from menopause are normal, so they’re not going to cover it. Once [the topic of menopause] is addressed by corporations, that’s when the insurance companies also have to change.”\nAs well as getting corporations involved, Chan believes it’s essential that men also join the conversion on women’s health. “When we call it women’s health, it’s very easy for all women to take an interest and very easy for men to brush it aside, unless the men are in the throes of experiencing it through their wife or colleague,” says Chan. “When these discussions become corporatised and men are involved and we have all parties talking about these issues on a regular basis, it becomes much easier to address them.”\nThis story is part of our Front & Female In Conversation column, which appears monthly in the Tatler print magazine and is a series of discussions between women who are making an impact in their respective regions and fields.\nNOW READ\nEgg freezing and fertility preservation: Sow Fertility has everything you need to know\nWhy Women Aren’t Winning At Health (But Can): Exclusive book extract\nWomenX’s Dr Pui-Wah Choi on her love for science, her mission to improve women’s health and her disease-detecting menstrual pads\nTopics\nIn Conversation Ruth Lee Zara Chan traditional chinese medicine women's health",
