    "text": "Mote Marine Lab deploys new tools against red tide FOX 13's Kimberly Kuizon reports on Mote Marine Laboratory testing the efficiency of two new products developed to fight against red tide bloom in Venice and how the results inspired confidence from scientists.\nThe Brief Two products developed by the Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative called Clear and Xtreme were launched by Mote Marine Laboratory. The products produced a 70% kill rate of the red tide in two Venice canals, inspiring optimism from scientists. Scientists say they need to take this success and test the kill rates of more red tides in canals and waterways in Venice and the state. VENICE, Fla. - Dead fish floated along two canals in Venice as toxins from red tide kept residents inside.\n\"One of the most impactful things was standing on the seawalls with the residents right next to where we were deploying,\" said Kevin Claridge, Mote Marine Laboratory’s vice president for Sponsored Research and Coastal Policy Programs.\nREAD: Florida Wingstop manager throws hot grease, ranch dressing at customers during argument\nMote Marine Laboratory testing the kill rate of red tide on Thursday.\nThe backstory:\nAfter about five years of research, non-stop testing and finally receiving regulatory approval, Mote Marine Laboratory deployed two products from the Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative.\n\"Many of them were saying it was unbearable to be out and just sit on their patio and enjoy the nice day they were having because of the red tide,\" said Claridge.\nThe products, called Clear and Xtreme, were developed by Mote Scientists Dr. Dana Wetzel, Dr. Richard Pierce and the Heartland Energy Group before being used in the canals.\nCLICK HERE:>>> Follow FOX 13 on YouTube\n\"The two products we were working with are plant-based natural compounds. We devised a special deployment mechanism in partnership with a company that does oil spill and hazard waste cleanup,\" said Claridge.\nDig deeper:\nTesting started immediately, and the results were exciting.\n\"A 70% kill rate of the Karenia brevis. That’s a win for us. I think it’s a pretty good suppression of Karenia. You won’t completely knock it out of the water column, and we don’t want to eliminate it from the natural environment, but you want to knock it back where it’s causing the environment&apos;s ecological impacts,\" said Claridge.\nMote Marine Laboratory’s President and CEO Dr. Michael Crosby said he didn’t doubt what would happen.\nREAD: Trial set to begin for woman whose car went airborne killing passenger\n\"This stuff works and does no greater harm to the environment than the red tide is doing,\" said Crosby.\nWhat's next:\nMote Marine Laboratory has other products to deploy pending review and approval from the EPA. They’re hoping to scale up deployment to an active bloom.\n\"This won’t be a success if we can only do a canal or two. We have to be able to really view this a little more as a military operation and being able to attack with deployment of these compounds and methods wherever that red tide is,\" said Crosby.\nThe Source: FOX 13's Kimberly Kuizon collected the information in this story.\nWatch FOX 13 News: STAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 13 TAMPA:\nDownload the FOX Local app for your smart TV Download FOX Local mobile app: Apple | Android Download the FOX 13 News app for breaking news alerts, latest headlines Download the SkyTower Radar app Sign up for FOX 13’s daily newsletter Venice Environment Red Tide DAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .\nTrending\nSixth teenager arrested for brutal Davis Islands dog park attack",

New Delhi, April 4 The Delhi High Court on Thursday expressed satisfaction at the decision of the Delhi Health Minister and Health Secretary to adopt the Central government statute, The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, to regulate clinical facilities across the national capital. The high court had issued a stern warning to Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj and Health Secretary S.B. Deepak Kumar last time, threatening jail if they fail to comply with court orders aimed at shutting down unauthorised pathology labs in the national capital. The Delhi government on Thursday informed that both the Health Minister and the Health and Family Welfare Secretary have agreed to advance the Delhi Health Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill to the Centre for requisite approval. Meanwhile, to ensure immediate regulation, the Central government statute will be enforced in Delhi. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmohan P.S. Arora commended this development, stating, \"This court is happy to note that after the last hearing, the Delhi Health Minister and the Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) have agreed...\" Acknowledging the authorities' commitment, the bench disposed of the 2018 petition by Bejon Kumar Misra, alleging the operation of unauthorised laboratories and diagnostic centres by unqualified technicians in Delhi. Earlier, taking a stern stance on the delay in enacting legislation to regulate clinical establishments, including laboratories, within the national capital, the court had asked the Minister and Secretary to appear personally before the court. The bench had expressed frustration with the apparent power struggle between the Minister and the Health Secretary, saying that their disagreements should not hinder the execution of court directives. The court's last directive came in response to an email indicating that the Health Minister was not adequately informed during discussions concerning the Delhi Health Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2022, also known as the Delhi Health Bill. The bench had expressed dismay over the prolonged delay, remarking: \"We can only say it is a sorry state of affairs. This has been pending for the last five years.\" The court had directed the Delhi government to expedite the process of finalising the bill, or alternatively, consider implementing the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010. The Delhi government, in response, had assured the court of its proactive efforts to draft and enact a law to regulate clinical establishments, stressing the necessity to safeguard patient and healthcare provider interests. However, Misra's counsel had argued that the absence of regulation poses a significant threat to citizens' lives, with an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 illegal pathological and diagnostic labs operating in the city. The bench had said that the ongoing dispute between Bhardwaj and Deepak Kumar could not be an excuse for non-compliance with its orders, warning that it would not hesitate to jail them if their inaction continued to harm the public interest. As the Minister argued that the Delhi Health Bill had been finalised and sought the court's assistance in navigating political obstacles to its enactment, the acting Chief Justice had dismissed the notion of the court being used as a pawn in political games, stressing the urgent need for interim measures to prevent the public from receiving inaccurate medical reports. The court had ordered the Minister and the Secretary to collaborate closely to address the issues raised by the petitioner and to establish a fair and effective regulatory system for pathology labs as soon as possible.

    "title": "Re: Regarding an issue with Chromecast 2nd gen and Chromecast Audio",
    "text": "Monday\nHello,\nWe're aware of an emerging issue impacting Chromecast 2nd gen and Chromecast Audio devices, and we are working on a fix.\nDo not factory reset your device - we will keep you all updated when the fix rolls out. If you have already factory reset your device, we will provide instructions to set your device back up as soon as possible.\nThank you for your patience.\nAnswered!\nGo to the Recommended Answer.\nyesterday\nHi all,\nAn update on the situation: the team has identified the cause of the issue impacting Chromecast (2nd gen) and Chromecast Audio devices.\nPlease do not factory reset your device. If you previously performed a factory reset during troubleshooting, you may also be experiencing an issue where you're unable to re-setup your device. The team has identified the cause for this as well and is currently working on a fix.\nWe’re working to resolve this as soon as possible, and will keep you updated when there is more to share.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and appreciate your patience in the meantime.\nThank you.\n11m ago\nI agree and wonder how this will be rectified. i am not really confident it will be fixed without asking the device owner to do some custom weird workflow.\n13m ago\nMillions.\nyesterday\nClaro una certificación que Google \"olvido\" renovar..\nyesterday\nHello my friend. I think is not so easy. Google stopped selling Chromecast devices and they decided to stopped to support it.\nyesterday\nstop support is one thing, enter in my home and destroy silently, without adivise me in advance is another.\n8 hours ago\nNo se lo cree nadie verdad\nyesterday\nMust be easy to fix ...\nyesterday\nOne would think so, but the issue is now at least 24 hours old and there's no sign of a fix from Google. I went to Argos today and bought the Amazon Firestick HD.\nyesterday\nLOL\nyesterday\nPlease let me know if you know a way to cast to it from a Google phone\nyesterday\nIf the cert becomes past due and a new product is on the horizon?\nyesterday\nOui le certificat SSL ils ont oublié de faire la MAJ pour les Chromecast\n16 hours ago\nThere are a lot of chinese clones on Amazon and AliBaba - I'll buy one of those instead.\n8 hours ago\nI renew certificates everyday, would they like me to take over?\n7 hours ago\nIt really doesn’t matter what the specific cause was, just that the outage is due to a problem at Google and there is nothing a user can do but complain.\nan expired certificate would indeed be an unforgivable mistake by a company such as Google, if indeed that’s the root cause. Imagine if Google mail went down for all customers because of an expired certificate? This would make the nightly news and Google executives would be brought before Congress to account—and that from a service that most Americans use for free.\ni truly don’t believe a a certificate was really to blame. It’d be fixed by now if that were the only reason. A company like Google doesn’t let certificates expire unless they want to.\nbut again, the cause is internal to Google. While interesting to those of us in the tech world, the users are not meant to care why. Users just want things to work. In the grand scheme of things why is way down the list to most users since users cannot fix the issue on their own.\n7 hours ago\nIn this day and age, a root certificate should never need to be maintained by humans. This should 100% be automated! I am floored that Google was affected by this.\nan hour ago\n10 year certs are reasonable. There just needs to be a way to move over to a newer cert. Almost no end user can, nor should have to, mess around with this. Power off and power on should be the process, but it's not yet available.\nMonday\nToo late for to say DO NOT FACTORY RESET YOUR DEVICE LoL\nMonday\nyes dear, same here, i have reset it, now what will happen...\nMonday\nHope they send information out when this is fixed. I have also factory reset it.\nyesterday\nI too factory reset it\n15 hours ago\nWe all factory reset it because that’s what googles troubleshooting guide told us to do.\nyesterday\nGoogle has acknowledged the problem and is actively working on a fix. In the meantime, some users have found a temporary workaround by resetting their Chromecast and manually setting their phone's date to a day before the issue began (prior to March 9, 2025). This method has allowed them to add the device back using the Google Home app.\nyesterday\nReally? Could I do that? As many of us here, I have factory reseted my device. I don't think it matters too much but if not, will we have any problem to update our devices later?\n8 hours ago\nIt said on here NOT to factory reset your device. So I don’t think anything will work for you now . You’ll need the steps the reverse the factory reset\nyesterday\nAdd the device back but still can't actually stream anything\nyesterday\nverrry interesting\nyesterday\nOk super powerfull.\nI have change the date to 1 march and reset , restart and make the attach beetween chromecast 2 and my phone.\nyesterday\nAll is ok when i keep a date before the 8 march\nyesterday\nI don't want to have my iPhone with another date. I have to know which date is today.\n11 hours ago\nU can change it back straight after\n8 hours ago\nCan you have an iPhone?\n8 hours ago\nThat is not good though is it\nyesterday\nHow do you go back in date on settings?\nyesterday\ndont do anything, it is a google issue\nyesterday\nIf you have an android device just open settings and search for date. You'll see a toggle switch to turn off auto and then you can manually set the date and time under that.\nyesterday - last edited yesterday\nIt's the date setting on your phone/tablet (whichever you're using for the Google Home app), not the Chromecast.\nOn your Android device (I'm on v12 of the OS), go to \"Settings\" >> \"System\" >> \"Date & time\", toggle \"Set time automatically\" to the off position, tap \"Date\", and use the calendar dialogue to select a date prior to March 9th.\nIt's also probably a good idea to stop and clear the cache of the Google Home app prior to changing the date, if this process doesn't work the first time.\nGood luck!\nyesterday\nThank you. I've tried this before and it still doesn't allow me to cast only to connect the device unless I follow additional steps to by pass the authentication.\n5 hours ago\nDid it work? I changed the date on the phone after reset,it is there,but the same errors appear when I try to cast...a certain code on netflix,an untrusted device on youtube,nothing happens on max...they ruined this out of negligence or a desperate need for money. It seems billionaires are desperate for more money...\nyesterday\nHo provato,non funziona",

According to Corpus Christi Police Department Public Information Office, Lieutenant Eryca Gonzalez, officers were dispatched to a residence in the 7000 block of Natchez Drive on Dec. 24 at about 10:30 p.m. in reference to a welfare check. \"The caller was on location and told officers they had not heard from their family member in several days,\" stated Lt. Gonzalez. \"When the officers arrived, they were unable to contact anyone inside of the home,\" added Lt. Gonzalez. The family members then made entry into the home. Once they were inside the home, police officers located a deceased 15-year-old male along with a deceased 49-year-old male. According to officials, Detectives with the Robbery Homicide Division were called out to investigate. \"Preliminary investigation is that it appears to be a murder/suicide,\" said Lt. Gonzalez. Officials said this is still an ongoing investigation. The 49-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy have not been identified yet pending an autopsy from the Corpus Christi Medical Examiner's Office.",

    "text": "The New York Times A pesar de la guerra, los extranjeros que convirtieron a Ucrania en su hogar permanecen ahí Leer todo el artículo Megan Specia Se actualizó el 30 de diciembre de 2023, 2:16 a. m. · 5 min de lectura Un servicio religioso en el Centro Islámico en Kiev, el 30 de junio de 2023. (Laura Boushnak/The New York Times)\nKIEV, Ucrania — Habían pasado solo tres meses de la invasión rusa a Ucrania a principios de 2022, pero Marwa Yehea quería regresar a su hogar en Kiev.\nYehea, de 31 años y originaria de Siria , había escapado de la capital ucraniana con sus dos hijas en febrero cuando la guerra comenzó. En esos primeros días de incertidumbre, Yehea estaba embarazada de su tercer hijo y pasaron algunas semanas en Alemania.\nNo obstante, la mujer estaba determinada a regresar a casa antes de que naciera su hijo. Para mayo de 2022, habían retornado a Kiev en tiempo para el alumbramiento.\nEste verano, durante una entrevista realizada en Kiev, Yehea comentó: “La guerra no ha terminado y el costo psicológico es agotador. Pero te acostumbras a ello. Además, nosotros en particular, como sirios que sobrevivimos una guerra, pues... aquí estamos a salvo”.\nEn las décadas previas a la invasión rusa, Kiev se había convertido cada vez más en una ciudad cosmopolita, un destino para los estudiantes y los profesionistas internacionales que deseaban construir una vida en Europa. Antes de la guerra, alrededor de 293.600 extranjeros residían de manera permanente en Ucrania, según cifras del gobierno en 2020.\nAlgunos han tomado la insólita decisión de seguir viviendo aquí, incluso cuando la guerra azota al país y millones han huido. En algunos casos, regresar a su país de origen es imposible y se han quedado en Ucrania en lugar de convertirse en refugiados por segunda vez. Otros simplemente no están dispuestos a abandonar las vidas que han construido en el país.\nAli Saleh, un ciudadano de Chad que se crio en Arabia Saudita después de que su familia huyera de la guerra civil, prepara el almuerzo en la cocina de su dormitorio en Kiev, el 1 de julio de 2023. (Laura Boushnak/The New York Times) Yehea, que ha vivido en Ucrania desde 2012, comentó: “Éramos felices aquí, nuestras vidas aquí eran buenas, alabado sea Dios. Hemos tenido una vida cómoda aquí”.\nLos estudiantes universitarios internacionales también han regresado, tras sopesar el valor de una educación asequible frente a los riesgos de la guerra.\nWang Zheng, de 23 años, originario de China, había estudiado en Ucrania desde 2017 y apenas iniciaba su maestría cuando comenzó la guerra. Regresó a China y continuó sus estudios en línea, pero regresó a Kiev la primavera pasada. El estudiante señaló que su educación “es lo más importante” y agregó: “No puedo rendirme”.\nContinuar leyendo la historia Kiev es donde conoció a su novia, Wang Danyang, de 26 años, una cantante de ópera de formación que también es oriunda de China. Ella regresó a Kiev en julio y comenzaron a vivir juntos. La cantante afirma que quieren construir su vida aquí.\nÉl manifestó: “Siento que esta es mi segunda patria”.\nAlrededor de 76.500 estudiantes extranjeros estaban inscritos en universidades ucranianas en 2020 y el porcentaje más grande provenía de India.\nDos estudiantes de ese país, Jaanvi, de 20 años, cuyo nombre legal se compone solo de esa palabra, y su compañera de cuarto Mary Fiona, de 22, estudiaban Medicina en Kiev cuando estalló la guerra. Jaanvi llegó en diciembre de 2021, tan solo meses antes de que comenzara la invasión rusa, y huyó cuatro días después del inicio de los combates.\nEn enero de 2023, ambas mujeres regresaron a Ucrania, impertérritas por los ataques aéreos.\nEl centro de la ciudad está lleno de humo después de los ataques con cohetes rusos en la capital de Ucrania el 29 de diciembre de 2023 en Kiev. Rusia lanzó ataques con misiles dirigidos a importantes ciudades ucranianas, incluyendo la capital, Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro al este, Odesa y Kharkiv. Rusia atacó Ucrania con 122 misiles y 36 drones, dirigidos a un hospital de maternidad, escuelas, jardines de infantes, un centro comercial, edificios de gran altura y casas particulares, resultando en 12 muertos y 75 heridos. Las operaciones de búsqueda y rescate están en curso, ya que las fuerzas de defensa aérea destruyeron 114 objetivos aéreos. Jaanvi opinó: “Si vas a morir, también puedes hacerlo en tu casa. Todo está en manos del destino. Hay búnkeres y aquí también viven ucranianos”.\nZyad Hakim, de 24 años, estudiaba Ingeniería Mecánica en el Instituto Politécnico de Kiev desde hacía 5 años cuando comenzó la guerra y no estaba dispuesto a abandonar el trabajo que había completado.\nHakim, originario de Marruecos, regresó a su país al principio de la guerra, pero luego, en enero de 2023, retornó a Kiev para terminar su último semestre. El joven terminó su carrera este verano y regresó a Marruecos.\nEn Kiev, pocos días antes de partir, Hakim explicó: “Necesitaba venir aquí y completarla. De lo contrario, todo mi esfuerzo se iría a la basura, al olvido”.\nIncluso algunos cuya vida en Ucrania no ha sido ideal todavía dicen que el país es su hogar.\nAbdullah Hossein al-Rabii, de 40 años, propietario de un popular restaurante en Kiev cerca del Centro Islámico, se mudó ahí en 2013, después de huir de la guerra civil en Siria. Al-Rabii sirve faláfeles, hummus, shawarmas y otros platos del Medio Oriente y habitualmente se le puede encontrar en la parrilla en el frente, donde saluda a sus clientes, en su mayoría ucranianos, con una cálida sonrisa mientras el humo se arremolina alrededor de ellos.\nAl-Rabii indicó: “No estoy varado en Ucrania. No quiero irme”.\nNo obstante, Al-Rabii vive en un limbo, al igual que miles de otros sirios que llegaron aquí. Ucrania nunca les otorgó el estatus pleno de refugiados, sino que les brindó “protección complementaria”, que es temporal y no proporciona ningún camino hacia la residencia permanente.\nEl pasaporte sirio de Al-Rabii ya expiró y no ha visto a su familia en Siria (ni ha salido de Ucrania) en una década.\nMuchos sirios en Ucrania huyeron a otras partes de Europa cuando la guerra comenzó , en busca de seguridad y un futuro más estable. Sin embargo, Al-Rabii, que está casado con una mujer ucraniana, está decidido a quedarse.\nAl-Rabii concluyó: “Lo peor es que antes eras un refugiado; después, escapaste, y, luego, podrías volver a serlo. Esto sería lo más doloroso”.\nc.2023 The New York Times Company\nTAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR | EN VIDEO: Soldado ucraniano viaja a Estados Unidos para recibir prótesis de brazo MÁS POPULARES La fiesta de celebridades \"casi desnudas\" que provocó un escándalo político en Rusia BBC News Mundo · 4 min de lectura La cena de Navidad en la megacárcel de Bukele BBC News Mundo · 13 min de lectura Fallece vedette Rossy Mendoza a los 80 años de edad San Diego Red · 1 min de lectura El pez invasor de 200 kilos que se alimenta de pirañas y avanza implacable por la Amazonía BBC News Mundo · 5 min de lectura La humillante tradición de hacer desfilar a mujeres desnudas como castigo en India LA NACION · 7 min de lectura",
