    "title": "How Dan James became the 'main man' for Leeds United and Wales - BBC Sport",
    "text": "2026 World Cup qualifying: Wales v Kazakhstan\nVenue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Saturday, 22 March Kick-off: 19:45 GMT\nCoverage: Watch on BBC One Wales, iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app, plus S4C via iPlayer. Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sport Extra.\nEight games from winning promotion to the Premier League. Eight fixtures standing in-between Wales and the 2026 World Cup.\nLeeds United's Dan James knows he could about to have the year of his life.\nFortunately for club and country, he's having the season of his life.\nOnce widely criticised for lacking end product, he is now on track for a career-best tally of goals and assists in a single campaign.\n\"Outstanding,\" Daniel Farke has said of someone who has become integral to Championship leaders Leeds' bid to return to the top-flight, a player happy to carry the weighty Elland Road expectations of success.\nCraig Bellamy will be hoping for just as much attacking influence on the international stage as Wales plot their path to north America.\nAnd James is not shying away from it.\n\"I'm not a young player anymore,\" he says. \"I want to try and be that main man.\"\nBut, even for a player of electrifying pace, getting to that stage has taken some time.\nBellamy was made to be a manager - Hughes\nPublished 10 hours ago Who would you pick for Wales' World Cup qualifier?\nPublished 2 days ago 'That'll hurt forever' - World Cup pain drives Bellamy\nPublished 2 days ago 'Too good for the Championship' Maybe because he still appears somewhat fresh-faced, it's easy to forget how much 27-year-old James has already packed into his career.\nFrom his acceleration onto the scene as a teenager at Swansea City, there have been two major finals, 55 caps, and two £20m-plus moves since.\nBut there have also been crushing disappointments to deal with. From losing his father Kevan just weeks before completing a dream move to Manchester United in 2019, to the missed penalty that denied Wales shoot-out qualification for Euro 2024.\nThere was even the fact Leeds – who he joined for £25m in 2021 - had seemingly washed their hands of him, sending him out on loan to Fulham a year later.\nIt added to questions of whether the winger could cut it at the top level, something he was denied at answering when – back at Leeds – he was part of a side that lost last year's play-off final to Southampton.\n\"It would have been quite easy for him to have come back and think he was not wanted, that his days were numbered, and it was all against him,\" says Jon Newsome, a title-winner at Leeds.\n\"But he got his head down and become a better player. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better performer for Leeds. He's too good for the Championship.\"\nTen goals and nine assists – already just one goal contribution shy of last year's total - suggests he is right.\nFlourishing in the \"heavy\" Leeds shirt James' frightening speed has always made him a dangerous player.\nOr \"menacing\" as Bellamy once described him, having been without him for the first four games of his unbeaten start to life as Wales manager in the successful Nations League campaign.\nBut there is more to James' game now. A hardened mindset has seemingly brought a sharper edge – and, to use an adjective James repeatedly used about his improvements – a more \"ruthless\" player.\n\"As a winger I want to be as direct as possible, not turning things down,\" he says of what's changed, besides staying injury-free.\n\"Sometimes I look back at games and I've been quite safe. That might look good from the outside, keeping the ball, but ultimately I'm in the team to try and create things. That constant mindset of 'can I get a goal or an assist?' – and believing that.\n\"And when you do give the ball away, it's so important the reaction is to want it again.\n\"You might get tackled nine times out of ten but it's about that tenth time where something will happen, and I'm trying to keep that mindset.\"\nIt's been noticed. Leeds fans have found a new hero, James stepping into the space left when Crysencio Summerville moved to West Ham United last summer.\n\"There's definitely a difference this season,\" says Newsome, a co-commentator with BBC Radio Leeds.\n\"His final ball and end product is a lot better. He realises his assets - like that pace - and uses them to their best at every opportunity, but there's a maturity to his play.\n\"There's the responsibility of being an older player now, and suddenly the main man and coping with the expectation.\n\"The Leeds shirt can be heavy to wear at times, and it's too much for some. He's flourished.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, World Cup disappointment drives Wales forward James\nAn unlikely leader That comfort in being the go-to attacking hope has seen James' confidence levels rocket, as well as new leadership qualities shine.\nFarke says it's less about speeches but about work-rate, setting standards – music to the ears of Bellamy whose Wales team have similar pass, press and pace-filled principles.\n\"When you start the press off you can get the boys up for it on the pitch rather than off it,\" says James, who adds he's happy with the added responsibility at club and country.\n\"It doesn't add any pressure. There's games where things you try maybe don't go right, but you just continue to try and do the right stuff and keep trying to be that main man.\"\nIt's a trait James says he looked up to in Bellamy when the manager was himself an explosive attacker in the red of Wales.\nHaving only just shaken off a hamstring injury when he met up with the new-look Wales for the first time in November, James is eager to show he has soaked up the advice of an individual he takes inspiration from.\n\"He had that work-rate and he always wanted the ball, demanded the ball,\" he says.\n\"He wants the same from us, but the biggest thing I've tried to take into my game is to always get at your man.\n\"It's easy to get the ball, pass backwards when things aren't going right - and much tougher when it hasn't gone right to have the mindset of going again.\n\"Sometimes there's a risk of players or the crowd getting on you – but not here and the manager has your back.\"\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Dan James started his youth career at Hull City before joining Swansea City's academy\nA manager and a player of 'ruthless mentality' It all suggests Wales' adrenaline-fuelled style that saw them top their Nations League group is going to carry on into the World Cup campaign.\nAnd with James ready to embody the ethos when the World Cup campaign kicks off against Kazakhstan in Cardiff – and prepared be the main man, just as Bellamy once was.\n\"Exactly, that was him as a player; he had that ruthless mentality, he believed he was going to win the game for the team,\" he says, perhaps conscious that Wales will be missing another key and in-form attacker in the injured Harry Wilson.\n\"To have that person behind you, to put you in the situations to go and effect games and show your attributes, that's brilliant to know as a player.\"\nAnd a knowledge that could see James' impressive improvements continue in what could be a memorable year for club and country.\nRelated topics Wales Men's Football Team Championship Football FIFA World Cup Leeds United",

    "text": "Sonrixs podría perder la movilidad de su mano tras un accidente jugando vencidas\n[Mariana Alcántara Contreras](/autor/mariana-alcantara-contreras)\nEl influencer [Sonrixs ](https://www.record.com.mx/contra)volvió a las redes sociales tras una cirugía de emergencia, donde le operaron un hueso que se rompió en tres partes. Desde una camilla en el hospital, compartió un video en TikTok explicando su situación y la razón de su hospitalización.\nSonrixs\", podría perder la movilidad de su mano\nHace unos días, Jorge Iván Hernández Ramírez, el influencer, publicó un video desde un hospital con el brazo enyesado, pero no dio detalles sobre su situación. Sus fans se sorprendieron, ya que poco antes había compartido imágenes de una celebración familiar. En el video, mencionó que iba a ser operado y que todo sucedió rápidamente, expresando su confianza en que todo saldría bien.\nSonrixs informó que el juego de 'las vencidas' o 'fuercitas' podría costarle la movilidad de su brazo, ya que resultó en la ruptura de uno de sus huesos.\n“Podría perder la movilidad de mi mano. Mi hueso se rompió en tres pedazos y provocó que pasara por una cirugía de cinco horas, me pusieron 11 tornillos y una placa de hombro a codo que me va a acompañar para el resto mi vida”, comentó el influencer.\nLa cirugía del influencer duró cinco horas y consistió en la colocación de 11 tornillos y una placa de hombro a codo, que lo acompañará de por vida.\n“Todo esto por un juego que alguna vez todos hemos jugado. Que yo creía que era inofensivo: las vencidas o las fuercitas. Los doctores me dijeron que los accidentes así son comunes. Me gustaría que tú supieras los riesgos porque yo no lo sabía y me podría cambiar la vida”.\nLos doctores indican que no hay certeza sobre si el Sonrixs recuperará la movilidad en su brazo; se necesita tiempo para saberlo.\n“Los doctores me dijeron que fue una cirugía compleja debido a que cuando mi hueso se rompió aplastó el nervio radial que es el encargado de hacer movimientos muy importantes en mi mano y que tuve la gran suerte de que no se rompió. La mano aún no la puedo mover y la movilidad podría regresar o no, no lo sabemos, es cuestión de tiempo\", señaló.\nGracias a todos por sus bonitos mensajes\n[TAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR: Utopías CDMX: Dirección de las 16 nuevas instalaciones y atracciones que tendrán](https://www.record.com.mx/contra/utopias-cdmx-direccion-de-las-16-nuevas-instalaciones-y-atracciones-que-tendran)",

    "title": "Molalani residents finally to receive new tar road | Letaba Herald",
    "text": "Last week, Maruleng Local Municipality Mayor Tsheko Musolwa, introduced the contractor, TND Trading Enterprises, to the community during a handover ceremony in Molalani. The project will cost R27m and will create jobs for 30 people. Musolwa said on March 2 the municipality met with the Barcelona community to discuss three projects. “They had complaints on the roads and a bridge, and we told them we would return with a response.”\n“They said that when it rains, they cannot cross a stream and children cannot go to school. Access to Santeng village was also problematic and because of the road they do not receive any services from the municipality,” said Musolwa. He said the community stated that the road was riddled with potholes and that the tar had disintegrated. They saw that the roads were being repaired in other villages, but their problems were not addressed.\nAlso read: Maruleng mayor keeps promise for new road\n“Today I’m here with the answers to your cries,” said the mayor. He said the former mayor tarred the road that connects with the D21. “This was a long time ago and as you can see for yourselves, it is badly damaged.” He said during the meeting earlier in Barcelona, residents requested rehabilitation of the road. “When we came here, we wanted to introduce two projects, but we have added a third one. The first one is that this week, or next, we will introduce a contractor for the bridge so that they can start the project,” he added.\nHe said that after the bridge is completed, they will build a road from Santeng which will cross the bridge from Molalani. “We heard your complaints and that is why we are here today. We are no longer doing things without alerting the community. We are planning to immediately start with the road to Santeng once we fi nish this one.” He said the municipality wanted to deliver services to the community, but that they need to follow processes. “I know that we came late but we ended up coming,” he said.",

    "title": "Corée du Nord: Pyongyang critique la vente d’hélicoptères américains à Séoul - 20 minutes",
    "text": "La Corée du Nord a qualifié jeudi d’acte «imprudent et provocant» la vente par les Américains d’hélicoptères Apache à la Corée du Sud, affirmant qu’elle y répondrait par un renforcement de son propre arsenal. «Il s’agit d’un acte imprudent et provocant» qui vise à «délibérément augmenter l’instabilité sécuritaire dans la région», a fustigé dans un communiqué le ministère de la Défense nord-coréen. 36 hélicoptères «Nous nous opposons fermement (…) au renforcement militaire (…) des forces vassales» des États-Unis, a-t-il déclaré, critiquant par la même occasion des ventes récentes américaines au Japon et à d’autres alliés de Washington en Asie-Pacifique. Les États-Unis ont annoncé lundi avoir approuvé la vente de jusqu’à 36 hélicoptères d’attaque Apache, ainsi que du matériel lié, dont des missiles, à la Corée du Sud pour un total d’environ 3,5 milliards de dollars (2,9 milliards de francs). Selon l’agence américaine pour la coopération en matière de défense (DSCA), elle doit permettre «d’améliorer les capacités de la République de Corée (nom officiel de la Corée du Sud) à faire face aux menaces actuelles et futures» avec «une force capable de dissuader les adversaires». «Dissuasion stratégique» La transaction doit encore être validée par le Congrès américain avant d’être effective. Cet accord va amener Pyongyang à «renforcer encore» ses propres moyens de «dissuasion stratégique», a souligné vendredi le régime nord-coréen. L’annonce de la vente est intervenue au premier jour des traditionnels exercices militaires annuels menés conjointement par Washington et Séoul. Baptisées «Ulchi Freedom Shield», elles mobiliseront des milliers de militaires jusqu’au 29 août. Washington est le principal allié de Séoul en matière de sécurité.",

    "title": "Antonio Pulido: “Devolvemos a la sociedad parte de lo que recibimos” | Andalucía Información. Todas las noticias de Granada",
    "text": "El presidente de la Fundación Cajasol, Antonio Pulido, se siente orgulloso de la labor que realiza su entidad en Andalucía, porque están consiguiendo “devolverle a la sociedad parte de lo que recibimos de ella”, un balance que ha realizado en el programa ‘Acento Andaluz’ de 7TV en el que ha analizado también la situación financiera y económica. Así, Pulido ha considerado sobre el futuro de Unicaja que el “tamaño es importante y que tiene que mejorar sus ratios” para operar en el sistema financiero actual, aunque sí que ha alabado la profesionalización de su equipo”, porque “no podemos estar con cuotas territoriales”. “Es una reflexión general”, insistía Pulido, que sí destacaba que “Unicaja ha hecho una cosa muy bien, que es la profesionalización de su equipo directivo. No podemos estar con cuotas territoriales”, apuntaba, explicando que si no se huye de los “conceptos de origen” y se aplican criterios estrictamente profesionales, “no funciona, ninguna empresa del mundo funciona”. Pulido también ha aplaudido la apuesta por la simplificación administrativa emprendida por el Gobierno andaluz e incluso ha invitado al resto de administraciones “sean del signo que sean a que encojan de alguna manera los trámites”, que obligan a una pyme a buscarse una gestoría cuando “hay que facilitar lo máximo posible”. Ha asegurado que la estabilidad política, como la que vive Andalucía en estos momentos, es un valor de crecimiento y un factor para la inversión, inversiones que ve algo ralentizadas en España por la situación política actual, aunque ha considerado que en general “va bien, no para un sobresaliente o notable, pero sí un bien”, ya que sólo algo de freno en las inversiones y el escaso ahorro de las familias como puntos negativos de la economía actual. Balance de la Fundación Cajasol “Estamos llegando, hay capilaridad y la gente se siente identificada”, decía Pulido satisfecho al hacer un balance general de la Fundación Cajasol, apuntando que están consiguiendo su objetivo, “devolverle a la sociedad parte de lo que recibimos de ella”, algo que están consiguiendo a través de la cultura, la acción social, el emprendimiento, la formación y deportes Destacó como referentes la programación de Semana Santa, que en el caso de la sede de Sevilla se traduce en tres exposiciones de Tramos de Cuaresma a la vez, y la de los Gozos de Diciembre, de especial tradición especialmente en las provincias en las que está más implantada, como es Sevilla, Huelva, Cádiz y Córdoba, que en su opinión forman parte del “ideario colectivo” de la sociedad. También destacó los programas solidarios como Andaluces Compartiendo o Cajasol Educa, con un enfoque que no sólo busca aportar alimentos sino también formación e integración, o la Escuela de Negocios del Instituto de Estudios Cajasol, con la que se busca que los que se formen “reporten el valor añadido a su tierra”, con un 60% de alumnos becados.
