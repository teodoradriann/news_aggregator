    "text": "Commissioners in Darke and Mercer counties issued a declaration this week in support of poultry farmers and are seeking state and federal assistance amid an ongoing bird flu outbreak.Darke and Mercer counties account for all but nearly 243,000 of Ohio’s more than 12.2 million highly pathogenic avian influenza cases among commercial poultry operations since the first case reported Dec. 24 in Darke County and Jan. 10 in Mercer County, according to data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Ohio Department of Agriculture .Both resolutions approved Tuesday said the HPAI outbreak poses a severe risk to the economic stability of the agricultural sector and affects employment, supply chains, price inflation and small businesses because the affected poultry farms are vital to the local economy and provide essential food products to the region, state and nation.“The outbreak of (HPAI) requires immediate and effective intervention, including the provision of emergency funding, resources and technical support to mitigate further losses, contain the spread of the disease and restore affected agricultural operations to full productivity as quickly as possible,” both resolutions stated.Commissioners in Darke and Mercer counties declared an emergency due to the bird flu outbreak and requested six types of support from the state and federal governments: Affirmation of testing: In barns that have tested positive but are not showing clinical symptoms, commissioners request that the flock owner be allowed to take three additional test samples. One sample would be sent to a state or federal lab and the other two to an accredited lab of the owner’s choice. Killing the flock would be delayed until the three samples show consistency with a positive result. Immediate financial aid and compensation: Allocation of emergency financial support to poultry farmers in Darke and Mercer counties directly affected by the HPAI outbreak, including compensation for loss of poultry and revenue due to quarantine and killing the flock. Resource allocation: Providing personal protective equipment, disinfectants and biosecurity supplies to support the efforts of farmers, veterinarians and agricultural extension workers managing the outbreak and preventing further spread. Veterinary support and expertise: Providing veterinary professionals and disease control experts to assist with diagnosis, testing and culling of infected poultry in addition to guidance on best practices for disinfection and recovery measures for affected farms. Extension of emergency funding programs: Providing low-interest loans, grans or insurance claims through existing federal or state agricultural relief programs to affected farmers for recovery, repopulation of flocks and infrastructure repair. Coordination with state and federal agencies: Coordinating response and resources and with state and federal agencies such as the USDA, Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Ohio Department of Natural Resources and exemptions from select regulations.Source: USDA, Ohio Department of Agriculture",

    "text": "On this the last Sunday before Christmas Day, put yourself in the shoes of one of the family members of the five brave soldiers who died in that fateful helicopter crash last month. Lieutenant Colonels Michael Charles and Michael Shahoud, Retired Brigadier Gary Beaton, Lieutenant Colonel Sean Welcome and Warrant Officer Class II, Jason Khan died in a war that never was, but in the middle of the ongoing and never-ending battle of keeping Guyana’s borders safe and guarding the nation’s territorial sovereignty. Two colleagues survived – Corporal Dwayne Jackson and Lieutenant Andio Crawford – but they too also sacrificed their lives to ensure Guyana’s borders are always safe from any external intervention, whether by land, air or sea. None of the valiant Guyana Defense Force (GDF) soldiers on that fateful flight ever imagined what happened, but each was always aware that every flight in Guyana’s defense is part of a lifelong personal and boundless sacrifice. None could have imagined not returning home safely, or not seeing Christmas, or not celebrating the New Year’s. None of the brave soldiers’ families, on saying goodbye that fateful day, could or would have imagined it would have been the final hug or kiss. From the beginning of the latest threats of territorial aggression from next door, our valiant GDF’s Chief of Staff assured that Guyanese, at home and abroad, could count on Camp Ayanganna to monitor the situation on our borders and advise the nation accordingly. The GDF, born partly out of the border controversy after 1966 when the new nation promised ‘Not a blade of grass’, has valiantly guarded our borders in the 57 years since; and it’s to the valiant soldiers in uniform that the daily duty falls to ensure that the Golden Arrowhead continues to represent all of Guyana’s 83,000 square miles or 616,000 square kilometers. We will never part with two-thirds or five-eighths of the One Guyana we’ve lived and grown with. The five departed soldiers will not see tomorrow, but the ultimate contribution of their lives to the cause of protecting the Motherland will continue to ever light our way, and way beyond Christmas 2023 and the 2024 New Year’s celebrations. Fortunately, the political directorates have lowered the heated temperature, but it still remains the task of every soldier, in and out of uniform, to always be on guard, in all circumstances, which is what the GDF’s ultimate mission is all about. Even on Christmas Day tomorrow and New Year’s Day next week, our men and women in fatigues will be guarding our borders and keeping them – and us all – safe and secure, while we eat and drink, sleep and awake, making merry. But those who died, those who survived and those who serve in the land, sea and air units of the national defense force – and indeed all our men and women in our uniformed discipline services – can rest assured that this Government of Guyana will leave no stone unturned in ensuring continued enhancement of our national defense capacity. Our five faithfully departed soldiers have been nationally honoured and their families and friends — and all Guyanese — will forever remember and appreciate the ultimate sacrifice they made in the never-ending war of always ensuring Guyana can defend itself. Our faithful five will eternally rest in peace; and all external designs on Guyana will also always rest in peace!",

    "title": "No. 5 CU Buffs women’s basketball completes road sweep at Arizona State",
    "text": "TEMPE, Ariz. — The Colorado women’s basketball team will take a win any time. Particularly on the road in conference play.\nYet after Friday’s win at Arizona in the first Pac-12 Conference road game of the season, head coach JR Payne expressed a slight level of frustration at an effort that featured 19 turnovers and sketchy defense that kept the Wildcats’ upset bid alive until the final buzzer.\nPayne wanted to see her club return to Colorado basketball, and the fifth-ranked Buffaloes delivered on Sunday. CU buried Arizona State in the first half to complete the road sweep, topping the Sun Devils 81-68 in at Desert Financial Arena.\nIt was the seventh consecutive win for the Buffs, who also secured the program’s first 3-0 start in conference play since the 1996-97 season. The Buffs secured their first sweep of the Arizona trip since the 2012-13 season and recorded just their seventh two-game road sweep since joining the Pac-12.\nIt was a big afternoon for CU’s frontcourt tandem of Aaronette Vonleh, who went 10-for-15 with 20 points, and Quay Miller, who posted her fourth double-double of the season with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Vonleh briefly left the game in the first half after rolling her left ankle but soon returned.\n“I think that our main focus was to just play our kind of basketball,” Miller said. “Whatever was going to open up for us, that’s what we were going to go with. Fortunately, they forgot to guard one of our biggest weapons (Vonleh). So we just kept going to her.”\nCU enjoyed a fast start, scoring the game’s first nine points while the Sun Devils missed their first six shots. But the hosts rallied, with ASU taking an 18-17 lead with 2 minutes, 45 seconds left in the first quarter. The Buffs, though, took control from there.\nThe Buffs scored the next 12 points and, after ASU stopped the run, CU immediately reeled off the next 14 points in a row. Following that one-point lead for the Sun Devils, the Buffs outscored ASU 33-7 for the remainder of the half to take a 50-25 lead at halftime.\nEven with an ice-cold fourth quarter, the Buffs shot an even 50%, hitting that mark for the sixth time this season. CU recorded 21 assists on 28 field goals for its 11th 20-assist performance of the season.\nStill, it wasn’t a flawless performance by the Buffs, who finished just 19-for-32 at the free throw line and struggled to the finish line in the fourth quarter as ASU trimmed what had been a 28-point Buffs lead late in the first half down to 10.\n“In this league, where everybody is so good, you have to be consistent,” Payne said. “You can’t play so well, and then so poorly. We’ve got to be able to balance that out. In spurts I thought we played really, really well. Shared the ball. Tons of assists on the number of field goals and things like that. Just a poor fourth quarter. We weren’t getting stops. We were fouling a lot. The clock kept stopping. We were getting to the free throw line but missing free throws. It just was very clunky down the stretch.”\nNotable\nCU point guard Jaylyn Sherrod scored only nine points but it was enough to move into 22nd-place on the program’s all-time scoring list. With three steals, Sherrod increased her career total to 236 to move into a tie for ninth all-time. … After entering the game 22-for-22 on free throws this season, CU’s Frida Formann went 0-3 at the line. … ASU’s Jayln Brown finished with a career-high 35 points, the most by any ASU player in 24 years. … The Sun Devils have lost 26 of their last 27 regular season conference games (28 of 29 including the league tournament).\nCOLORADO (13-1, 3-0)\nSherrod 3-6 3-4 9, Formann 5-7 0-3 13, Q. Miller 1-8 9-10 11, Vonleh 10-15 0-4 20, Nolan 3-6 2-2 11, Wetta 2-2 2-3 6, Smith 2-5 0-0 4, Whittaker 2-5 3-6 7, Sadler 0-1 0-0 0, Atchison 0-0 0-0 0, McLeod 0-1 0-0 0, Johnson 0-0 0-0 0.
