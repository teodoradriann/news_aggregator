    "title": "Income Stocks: A Once-in-a-Decade Chance to Get Rich",
    "text": "As the TSX today continues to recover, investors are likely to see their shares rise higher and higher in 2024. While some volatility may lie ahead, overall the market should continue to rebound, and we may even see all-time highs from stocks we never thought would rise again. Yet in this time, I urge you to not go straight towards growth stocks again. I say again because when investors had cash on hand, they decided that growth stocks were the answer. Yet when the market started to fall, these were the first companies to see their share price drop. Which is why income stocks are a far better option. Here’s why. Income over growth While huge returns are tempting, dividend income is stable — especially when you find an income stock that has a long history of dividend payouts and that maintains a strong payout ratio. See, a payout ratio should remain between 50% and 80%. That’s the sweet spot. If it is anything higher, the stock may cut the dividend because it cannot keep up. Anything lower, and it’s just not a priority. You want dividends to be a priority when it comes to finding an income stock. But you also want growth to be a priority, too. After all, the pair go hand in hand. Without growth, the company can’t keep up with dividend payments after all. So, here’s what you should look for if you want to get rich off income stocks. Value, value, value Yes, value. There are a number of ways to identify value when you’re looking for income stocks. First, you want to check all the basic boxes. Is the company’s payout ratio healthy? Does the company have enough equity to handle all its debts? Have there been growth initiatives seeing returns climb higher? Then look at the share price compared to fundamentals. That’s where immense value lies for those looking to get rich. There are so many options out there right now that remain far below where the share price should be. Investors should consider the company’s share price compared to what the company is earning. Further, the share price compared to sales. It should also have a low enterprise value (EV) compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBTIDA). If all these are low, then you likely have a value income stock on your hands. A stock to consider So, where is this magical unicorn of an income stock that could make you rich? A perfect choice these days would be Nexus Industrial REIT ( [TSX:NXR.UN](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-nxr-un-nexus-industrial-reit/364003/)). Nexus stock is in the industrial [properties](https://www.fool.ca/investing/top-canadian-reits-to-invest-in/) sector, a booming area of the market in high demand. And that’s only going to get stronger with the expansion of e-commerce. Yet Nexus stock is quite valuable. Shares are trading at 4.56 times earnings, with a whopping 8.01% dividend yield as of writing. The stock is still down 17% in the last year as of writing, though it has been recovering in recent months. It trades at 3.58 times sales, with an EV/EBITDA of just 9.37. With a payout ratio of 36%, the company may increase its dividends or use cash to pay its debts. If you were to put $15,000 towards Nexus stock then and see it return to 52-week highs, here is what you could end up with in 2024. |COMPANY||RECENT PRICE||NUMBER OF SHARES||DIVIDEND||TOTAL PAYOUT||FREQUENCY||PORTFOLIO TOTAL| |NXR.UN – now||$8||1,875||$0.64||$1,200||monthly||$15,000| |NXR.UN – high||$11.25||1,875||$0.64||$1,200||monthly||$21,093.75| That investment alone could achieve returns of $6,093.75 and dividends of $1,200. That comes out monthly as well! And then you’ll have a total of $7,293.74 in [passive income](https://www.fool.ca/investing/how-to-make-passive-income-in-canada/). So, get it while it lasts because it may not be around for another decade.",

Hoy en día, todo está en manos de los políticos, apuntó.\nAléinik expresó la esperanza de que, tarde o temprano, se reanuden esas conversaciones en el formato correcto entre Rusia y Ucrania, y agregó que naturalmente se ven como parte de ese proceso porque es un conflicto que afecta a Belarús directamente.\nRusia desarrolla desde el 24 de febrero de 2022 una operación militar especial en Ucrania cuyos objetivos, según el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, son proteger a la población de «un genocidio» por parte de las actuales autoridades de Kiev.\nIgualmente se persigue atajar los riesgos de seguridad nacional que representa el avance de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte (OTAN) hacia el este.\nHasta la fecha, Ucrania ha condicionado el cese de las hostilidades a la recuperación de todos los territorios, incluida Crimea, que se unió a Rusia en marzo de 2014.\nSin embargo, en una entrevista con el canal de televisión CBS News a finales de marzo, el mandatario ucraniano supuso que Rusia estaría lista para el diálogo si Ucrania consiguiera volver a las fronteras previas al 24 de febrero de 2022.\nLa última ronda de conversaciones entre Moscú y Kiev para lograr un acuerdo de fin de las hostilidades, tuvo lugar el 29 de marzo de 2022 en la ciudad turca de Estambul, y desde entonces los países no han vuelto a retomarlas.\nPreviamente a las conversaciones de Estambul, las delegaciones de Rusia y Ucrania celebraron una serie de consultas en Belarús a fines de febrero y en las primeras fechas de marzo de 2022.\nEl conflicto de Ucrania, según el Kremlin, puede avanzar hacia una solución política siempre y cuando se tenga en cuenta la nueva realidad territorial y se cumplan las garantías de seguridad en las que insiste Moscú.\ngfa",

    "title": "Why India’s 6Ghz spectrum dilemma is affecting PS5 Pro console launch in the country - The Hindu",
    "text": "The story so far: Earlier in November, the PlayStation 5 Pro console was released in key markets around the world, but no announcement was made regarding India. On November 8, Sony said, “PS5 Pro will not be available in some countries (which presently includes India) where 6GHz wireless band used in IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) has not yet been allowed.”\nWhat’s the brief history on WiFi bands? In India and throughout the world, WiFi has mainly used two key bands of frequency: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Home broadband users may recognise these frequencies as separate transmissions from the same router — 2.4GHz has limited data bandwidth, but can blanket a larger area with coverage. 5GHz is significantly faster, but covers a shorter distance. The frequencies for the spectrum used by these WiFi bands was de-licensed for indoor and outdoor use separately in India starting in 2002.\nThis state of WiFi technology remained the same well into the introduction of WiFi 6 in 2020. That technology uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies simultaneously, with greater efficiency, resulting in better speeds. But in 2021, WiFi 6E was introduced, splitting the world into two regions: those who allowed the use of 6GHz spectrum, and those that didn’t.\nWhat is 6GHz spectrum and what does it have to do with WiFi? By 2021, several regulatory authorities around the world, including Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S. began delicensing a third band of spectrum for WiFi. The WiFi 6E standard was introduced that year, allowing the creation of routers that broadcast on this frequency, bringing up theoretical maximum speeds to 9.6Gbps. This relied on the band of spectrum between 5,925MHz and 7,125MHz, known as 6GHz spectrum.\nBut in several countries, that is not yet the case. India and China have not allowed the use of 6GHz spectrum for WiFi yet. While the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) generally tries to keep wireless frequencies for telecom, WiFi, satellite and other use cases uniform around the world, several countries have not yet agreed on a standard division of the 6GHz band.\nNintendo DS console turns 20 on November 21, 2024 Who has the 6GHz band in India, and who wants it? The 6GHz band is currently with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for satellite use cases. However, satellite communications over 6GHz are unlikely to interfere meaningfully with WiFi-like use cases; at any rate, at the World Radiocommunications Conference last year, India and some other countries were able to get an extension till 2027 on what to do with some or all of the spectrum.\nAround the world, and certainly in India, telecom operators have expressed intense interest in getting 6GHz spectrum for 5G and 6G, a demand that India may be poised to entertain. Tech companies, such as those represented by the Broadband India Forum — Google, Meta, Amazon, and others — have argued for a US-like allocation for this spectrum to WiFi.\nBoth camps seem to be pushing for the entire 6GHz band to be used for either telecom or WiFi. The government may follow the lead of countries like Australia, which have delicensed half the spectrum, while considering what to do with the other half.\nSony’s PlayStation network outage impacts PS5, PS4 consoles What comes next and when will PS5 Pro be available in India? While the 6GHz debate is complex in its own right, it is not entirely clear that the consumer electronics’ interests are significantly impacted by India’s decision. Apple and Samsung phones sell in India with the exact same support for 6GHz WiFi, for instance, but the WiFi feature is programmed to avoid connecting to 6GHz spectrum. Presumably, Sony could do the same, by making consoles sold in India incompatible with this band of spectrum until regulatory clarity emerges.\nIf and when Sony decides that this is worth the work, or if they decide to invest in manufacturing a separate variant of the PS5 with older WiFi hardware, it will release in India.\nTelcos cast satellite Internet as threat to terrestrial networks; SpaceX mounts ‘passionate’ defence At any rate, WiFi 7 as a technology does not need 6GHz to work in India. Advances in WiFi technology are based not (just) on newer bands of wireless spectrum, but in greater efficiency and using these bands simultaneously. Even without the 6GHz spectrum, WiFi 7 routers can be sold in India that make the maximum wireless speed faster than any home broadband plans that are even sold here in the first place.\nIn response to a query from The Hindu , the Department of Telecommunications said that if “a router or device’s operating frequency is restricted to ... delicensed bands, they are permitted to be used in the country.”\nPublished - November 22, 2024 12:12 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Related stories PlayStation Pulse Explore wireless earbuds and Pulse Elite wireless headset launched in India Sony launches AI-driven 2024 Bravia 4K smart OLED TVs, on-boards Rajamouli as ambassador Sony launches MDR-M1 Reference Closed Monitor headphones for creators Sony launches new entry segment wireless earbuds WF-C510 in India",

    "text": "For the first time, Newport News, Virginia is being recognized as one of ten All-America City Award winners. The National Civic League presented this honor to celebrate the city’s work to actively engage residents in strengthening democracy through local action and innovation.\n“This is an historic day in the City of Newport News, as the prestigious All-America City Award celebrates our innovative programs and dynamic residents, community leaders, businesses, nonprofits, and employees,” said Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones. “Newport News has been on the vanguard of history for generations, and we continue to set the standard for how a community can and should leverage innovation to enhance civic capital. This award is a testament to our programs, which are building forward to impact today and future generations.”\n\"We are happy to designate Newport News as an All-America City,” said Doug Linkhart, President of the National Civic League. “Through their application and presentation, they showed that they are among the best in America at collaborating with residents and diverse stakeholders to tackle local challenges and seize opportunities. They remind us that the foundations of our democracy are strengthened through both individual and collective action.\"\nEarlier this year, communities from across the country submitted written applications showcasing their efforts to strengthen democracy, and the field was narrowed to twenty finalists. The finalist communities traveled to Denver, Colorado, where they connected and shared insights with peers, learned from national thought leaders, and presented their work to a jury of nationally recognized civic leaders. After careful deliberation, the jury selected ten winning communities, including Newport News.\n“During the presentation, I told the jury that dreams are realized in Newport News,” said Jones. “It was a dream of mine to bring this award to my hometown, and I am humbled and thrilled that Newport News is receiving this honor the first time we applied. I appreciate the contributions of our diverse delegation who spoke passionately about our transformative projects and their commitment to strengthening our community. I look forward to celebrating this achievement and continuing to share the story of Newport News across the nation.”\nThe jury cited that Newport News is tackling national issues at the grassroots level by prioritizing resident engagement in problem-solving. The city submitted three programs for consideration, including the:\nThe mission of the National Civic League is to advance civic engagement to create equitable, thriving communities. Founded in 1894, the League is America’s oldest good governance organization, championing many of the democracy innovations of the early 20th Century. Today, the League maintains the Model City Charter, organizes the All-America City Award, publishes the National Civic Review, and supports an extensive national network of local elected, appointed, and civic leaders. The League’s Center for Democracy Innovation works with public officials in the U.S. to understand, test, and disseminate the next generation of civic innovations, which have the potential to make democracy more participatory, equitable, and productive.\nLearn more about the National Civic League's All-America City Award.",

Este nuevo edificio, de 1.000 metros cuadrados, ampliará la capacidad de atención sanitaria en la capital riojana, sobre todo en las áreas de consultorios y servicios ambulatorios.\nEl ministro de Infraestructura, Marcelo del Moral, celebró el ritmo sostenido de los trabajos y destacó la relevancia del proyecto en el actual contexto nacional. \"En un contexto donde las obras están paralizadas, en La Rioja seguimos construyendo y garantizando derechos gracias a la firme decisión política del gobernador Ricardo Quintela\", enfatizó el ministro.\nCabe remarcar, que la obra forma parte de una serie de inversiones estratégicas del Gobierno provincial, las cuales tienen como objetivo descongestionar la atención del hospital principal y brindar una mejor respuesta a la demanda creciente en el sistema de salud pública. Además, la inclusión de nuevas áreas asistenciales permitirá optimizar el funcionamiento del nosocomio, con mejoras tanto para pacientes como para trabajadores de la salud.\nLas obras provinciales tras el temporal en Chamical\nLa obras sanitarias no son las únicas en las que invierte la provincia. Tras el severo temporal que azotó la localidad de Chamical en La Rioja, y dejó daños estructurales en al menos 60 viviendas, se puso en marcha el Plan Angelelli para abordar la reconstrucción. Este operativo de asistencia y recuperación cuenta con la participación activa de más de 40 obreros y tres empresas constructoras, lo que evidencia un esfuerzo coordinado para dar respuesta a las familias afectadas por el fenómeno climático.\nEl gobierno de La Rioja, mediante el Plan Angelelli y con el respaldo de fondos provinciales, prioriza en esta etapa inicial la reconstrucción de 33 de las 60 viviendas damnificadas. Se espera que estas primeras obras concluyan en los próximos días, lo que marca un avance significativo en el proceso de recuperación. Esta iniciativa no solo busca restituir los hogares afectados, sino que también impulsa la economía local a través de la creación de empleo en el sector de la construcción.\nLa diputada nacional Gabriela Pedrali, responsable de la ejecución del Plan Angelelli, resaltó la celeridad con la que se activó la respuesta oficial ante la emergencia en Chamical, siguiendo las directivas del gobernador Ricardo Quintela. Asimismo, enfatizó la urgencia de un mayor compromiso a nivel nacional, lo que señala que la falta de inversión en obra pública representa un riesgo para el bienestar de los sectores más vulnerables en situaciones de crisis.",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Kenneth Mailo loves fireworks. His black Labrador mix, Opihi, doesn’t feel the same way. “A lot of times he’s kind of reluctant and sometimes startled just because it’s coming out of nowhere and it’s loud,” Mailo said. “I wouldn’t say he’s a fan,” he added. Utah has criminal statutes restricting the times and places when Mailo and Opihi have to hear the pops, bangs and booms of retail fireworks. Data from Utah State Courts show those laws are rarely enforced. In the 3 ½ years ending with June 30 of this year, there were 63 cases of unlawful discharge or sale of fireworks filed in Utah courts. That’s less than two citations for every 100,000 Utahns during that span. “That sounds way to low,” said Chris Dake, another pet owner who was at a dog park in Sandy on Wednesday. “I would think in one city that would be a daily quota,” he added. The statutes say fireworks may only be discharged from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on July 2-5 and July 22-25. The hours are extended to midnight on the Fourth of July and Pioneer Day. “At a certain time of night,” said Alan Backman, another man at the dog park on Wednesday, “it needs to shut down. But how do you catch them? You can’t even stop people from running yellow and red lights.” Fireworks regulation is seen as a way to reduce the risks of wildfires in Utah. As July Fourth and Pioneer Day approach, public officials warn Utahns to follow the laws, especially those forbidding fireworks in areas where state or local governments have banned them. Cities and counties often publish maps on social media showing where fireworks are banned. Unlawful discharge of fireworks in Utah is an infraction with a fine of up to $1,000. It’s typically up to local police and fire departments to issue citations, said Utah State Fire Marshal Ted Black. “Law enforcement and the fire departments are enforcing the statutes,” Black contended in an interview Wednesday. “Obviously, they cannot catch everybody.” When asked whether the state courts data sounded too high, low or just right, Black responded, “We’re shooting for zero.” “And I realize that might sound a little pie in the sky,” he added. “We should celebrate this great nation and our freedoms. But please do so responsibly,\" Black said. \"Buy your fireworks locally. Use them according to the instructions and don’t use them in areas that have been closed to fireworks.” “There’s a reason Francis Scott Key wrote the rocket’s red glare. We are remembering the price paid,\" he said. If someone does start a fire or injure someone with fireworks, the scenario changes. He or she could be asked to pay for the damages or injuries or be charged with more serious crimes. Back at the dog park in Sandy, Mailo said he wasn’t sure what a stricter enforcement of the fireworks laws would look like. But, in theory, at least, he’s in favor of more citations. “I think we should be more mindful and aware of the issues that are underlying with not enforcing some of these things,” he said.",

    "text": "SUMMARY Gold opens on the MCX on Monday at Rs 62,502 per 10 grams Gold opens on the MCX on Friday at Rs 62,502 per 10 grams Gold and silver finished in a stronger position last week Gold prices opened on the MCX on Monday at Rs 62,502 per 10 grams and hit an intraday low of Rs 62,502. In the international market, prices hovered around $2,047.90 per troy ounce. Meanwhile, silver opened at Rs 72,796 per kg and hit an intraday low of Rs 72,660 on the MCX. The price hovered around $23.20 per troy ounce in the international market.\nAnuj Gupta, Chief of Commodity and Currency at HDFC Securities, said gold and silver finished in a stronger position last week. Despite geopolitical uncertainties, safe-haven demand helped boost gold prices to 62,362 levels, an increase of 0.93%. Silver also recorded an encouraging increase of 1.58%, ending the week at 72,480 levels.\n“Factors such as wedding season demand in the physical market and the dollar index’s recovery from lower levels following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes also contribute to the positive movement of these precious metals. The FOMC’s recent announcement of an unclear timeline for trimmed interest rates played a significant role in the currency recovery,” added Gupta.\nAlso read: ITR filed, refund not received yet?

These projections provide crucial insights for both casual and seasoned investors navigating these volatile markets.\nGupta said, \"For investors and traders closely following these trends, Gupta provided a range for potential movement. Gold's worth may fluctuate between $2050 and $2065 levels. On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), it may range from 62000 to 62800. Similarly, silver might trade anywhere from 72,000 to 74,000 levels.\"\nPublished on: Jan 15, 2024, 12:16 PM IST Posted by: Navneet, Jan 15, 2024, 12:13 PM IST IN THIS STORY #Gold Price #Silver price #Gold #Silver #Gold return #Gold rate #dollar #market #commodities #gold vs dollar rate #Markets Follow Us on Channel TOP STORIES TOP VIDEOS",

    "text": "O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva voltou a condenar, nesta quinta-feira (6), as informações falsas sobre a tragédia ambiental que assola o Rio Grande do Sul desde o fim de abril. Em Arroio do Meio (RS), ao lado de ministros para anúncio de novas medidas de socorro ao estado, Lula declarou que quem espalha fake news “não tem preocupação com o sofrimento dos outros”. É a quarta vez que o petista vai ao Rio Grande do Sul desde o início da tragédia ambiental. “Não acreditem em nada que vocês perceberem que seja anormal. Nos tempos de hoje no Brasil, temos a indústria da mentira, da maldade, da fake news, que não têm nenhuma preocupação com o sofrimento dos outros. Têm só objetivo de negar, de destruir”, criticou o presidente. Dados divulgados às 9h de quarta-feira (5) pela Defesa Civil local apontam que 172 pessoas morreram em decorrência da tragédia ambiental e outras 41 estão desaparecidas. Outras 30.442 estão em abrigos e 572.781, desalojadas. Ao todo, 2,3 milhões de pessoas foram afetadas pelas chuvas e enchentes, em 476 municípios — 95% do estado. Lula também pediu que os agentes públicos do estado não usem o desastre com intenções políticas. “Não permitam que as eleições deste ano atrapalhem o compromisso de vocês com o povo. Não permitam que seja usada com objetivos eleitorais essa desgraça que aconteceu. Vamos dar uma chance a este país. Uma vez na vida vamos tratar com seriedade aquilo que merece ser tratado com seriedade. A gente vai respeitar quem merece ser respeitado e a gente vai devolver ao povo gaúcho o direito de acreditar que tem gente interessada em cuidar”, declarou.",
