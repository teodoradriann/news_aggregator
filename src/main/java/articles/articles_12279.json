    "text": "Fifth seed and former champion Gerwyn Price was dumped out of the PDC World Darts Championship after a 4-2 defeat to Enniskillen’s Brendan Dolan.\nDolan held his nerve to close out the match with his first shot at tops after Price had clawed his way back from two legs down to level in the sixth set.\nIt was a crushing defeat for Welshman Price, who had been intent on repeating his victory in the behind-closed-doors tournament in 2021.\nDolan, who got through his second round match via a sudden death leg against his compatriot Mickey Mansell, had served an early warning when he took out the opening set with a 144 checkout.\nHis crisp finishing proved the difference as he nudged in front again at 2-1 on the bull, and 64 to repel Price’s advances to go 3-2 up and one set from victory.\nDolan looked set to be made to pay for missing a match-dart at bull at 2-0 in the sixth when Price hit back to break his throw, but the Northern Ireland 50-year-old saw it home in style.\nDolan told Sky Sports: “I was thinking we might go to a last leg but thank god it didn’t because I don’t know if I would have held myself together.”\nChris Dobey overcame a scare from Ross Smith to win 4-2 in the highlight of the afternoon session.\nA back-and-forth contest that saw 27 maximums posted throughout saw Dobey march into a 2-0 lead before being pegged back by Smith.\nAnother tight set saw Dobey edge ahead and he hit double 16 for the match to set up a meeting with reigning world champion Michael Smith in the last 16.\nStephen Bunting set up a last 16 clash with Michael van Gerwen after a stunning 4-0 win over Florian Hempel.\nBunting, the former BDO champion, nudged the opener 3-2 and from there the momentum was firmly with him as he swept Hempel away with a whitewash, averaging 101.15 throughout.\nAnother close contest saw Joe Cullen reach the next round with a 4-2 win over Ryan Searle.\nComments: Our rules\nWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

For fans of LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, don't worry — that shouldn't be the case for long. But for a couple nights, the corners of NBA Twitter have laughed at the fact that Bronny and the mostly disappointing Simmons have one statistic in common. In Simmons' NBA career, he has made five 3-pointers. In Bronny's NBA career, he has made five 3-pointers. MORE: Is LeBron playing tonight? Bronny edges Simmons in percentage, having shot 5-for-22 (22.7) compared to Simmons' 5-for-36 (13.9). Of course, Bronny should soon surge past...\nRead more at www.sportingnews.com",

    "text": "Heavy downpours expected to cause flooding in central Viet Nam The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has just issued Official Letter No. 8220/BNN-DD dated October 31, 2024 requesting central ministries, branches and 13 provinces and cities from Nghe An to Khanh Hoa, Gia Lai and Kon Tum to proactively respond to upcoming heavy rains and floods. |Lifeboats and rescue vehicles have been transported to Hoa Khanh Nam Ward, Lien Chieu District, Da Nang to be ready to respond to heavy rain and deep flooding. Photo: HOANG HIEP| According to National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, localities in central Viet Nam may experience heavy rains from November 3 to 10, 2024 due to bad weather phenomena. The meteorologist also noted that after November 10, 2024, heavy rain in the central region will continue to be complicated, with the potential for 2-3 more spells of heavy rainfall that will probably worsen the flooding in the region. In the second half of November and early December 2024, rain will be concentrated in the provinces and cities from Quang Binh to Phu Yen. To proactively respond to the development of heavy rain and floods in the coming days, and minimise damage, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development requests provinces, cities and ministries and branches to urgently overcome the consequences of storm No. 6, especially in the provinces and cities of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Da Nang. Heed will be on proactively harvesting early aquaculture and agricultural production with the motto \"green at home is better than old in the field\". At the same time, forces will be ready to evacuate people in areas at risk of deep flooding, flash floods, and landslides to safer places. Means of transport, equipment, and essential supplies will be well-prepared according to the motto 'four-on-the-spot' to be ready to respond to all situations. In addition, the developments of natural disasters will be informed to authorities at all levels and people to proactively prevent and respond. Ministries and sectors, according to their functions, will proactively coordinate with localities to review plans to ensure safety and effectiveness in response to flood developments.

    "text": "A coordenadora do BE, Mariana Mortágua, recordou o conflito Israel-Hamas na sua mensagem de Natal intitulada: “A mensagem de Natal que vos deixo é um grito contra a guerra”\n“Este ano não haverá celebrações de natal na cidade de Belém, a praça da manjedoura não terá a habitual arvore de natal gigante, as luzes decorativas não enfeitarão as ruas. Em vez do festejo há uma cidade de luto, tristeza e dor sob o fantasma da fome”, sublinhou a bloquista.\nMortágua apontou que “na cidade onde a tradição cristã acredita ter nascido jesus, o pior natal de todos os tempos será vivido em silêncio por tantas crianças que são diariamente retiradas dos escombros de gaza”.\n“Na palestina, 20.000 pessoas já foram mortas, a maioria jovens, mulheres, civis. Os hospitais fecharam, foram destruídos. Não há medicamentos, não há água, não há alimentação, não há para onde ir. Foram mortos mais de 100 funcionários das Nações Unidas. Foram assassinados quase 100 jornalistas”, destacou.\nAinda sobre a guerra, a coordenadora do BE levantou uma questão: “Sem o apoio da maior potencia mundial, alguém acredita que isto seria possível?”\n“A guerra do Médio Oriente que se soma à guerra que já tínhamos na Ucrânia depois da invasão russa é baseada numa mentira, a de que há uma solução militar para o conflito na Palestina”, frisou Mortágua.",
