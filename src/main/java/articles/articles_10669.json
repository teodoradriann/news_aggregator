    "text": "A Sikh woman from Anjar in Kutch has accused a Muslim youth from Jamnagar of impregnating her in the name of marriage before abandoning her. She also charged that he tortured her both physically and mentally as well as forced her to convert to Islam. A First Information Report was registered after she submitted a complaint at the Anjar police station and further investigation is underway. The accused has been identified as Hussain Baloch.\nOpIndia has a copy of the FIR. She stated in the complaint that she was introduced to the Muslim male by a known Muslim couple after which he promised her marriage and she moved to live with him along with her son at his residence. However, he forced her to have an abortion twice and she was later tortured there. Furthermore, a video of her recounting her experience became viral on social media.\nघटना गुजरात के #कच्छ से… #लव_Gहाद में तीन वर्ष तक हुआ हिंदू बेटी का शोषण-\nआरोपी #मोहम्मद_हुसैन मूल जामनगर निवासी।\nजामनगर में 3 वर्ष तक बंदी बना कर शारीरिक और मानसिक शोषण करता था मोहम्मद हुसैन और उसका परिवार।\nहुसैन और उसका परिवार बहुत मारता तथा डरा धमका कर रखता था, मोहम्मद हुसैन… pic.twitter.com/esNmC54QAR\n— Kajal HINDUsthani (@kajal_jaihind) May 24, 2024 According to the information, the victim who is originally from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur has been living in Gujarat. She is a divorcee and has a 10-year-old son from her husband. The marriage ended due to some disagreements. She and her son stayed together alone. Her brother is in the construction business, who builds and sells houses while she used to put them on rent.\nA Muslim young man named Sameer and his spouse came to stay in one of these houses in June 2021 which she used to frequent to collect rent. The two reportedly pressured her to get married in the Muslim community, but she was not ready. A few months later, in September he summoned her claiming that her aunt’s son Hussain, a native of Jamnagar, wanted to meet her. She informed that she yielded to his persuasion after refusing earlier and met the Muslim youth.\nShe unveiled that she was told to get married to him at the house but she turned down the proposal citing religious differences and returned from there. However, after a few days, Hussain contacted her and started talking to her. He wanted to begin a romantic relationship but she rejected him. He even sent her his pictures and called her repeatedly in order to push her to tie the knot with him. According to the complaint, the female succumbed to his pressure and travelled to Jamnagar in November 2021. She went to his house to meet his family where she spent the night and disclosed that the offender had sexual intercourse with her despite her protests.\nForced to embrace Islam, Hussian taught her son to offer namaz She stayed at Hussain’s house for two days and came back to her place. Afterwards, she discussed the marriage proposal with her family who expressed their opposition and warned that they would end all connections with her if she tied the knot with the perpetrator. However, she then took her son and went to his place but to her shock he claimed that the Nikah (Islamic wedding ceremony) could not take place until she became a Muslim because they belonged to separate religions.\nAn argument broke out between the couple after she refused to comply. Meanwhile, she, her son and Hussain had already started living in a new rented house in Jamnagar. However, he regularly compelled her to change her religion even there, based on the complaint. She highlighted that the culprit was also directing her son to offer namaz and thrashed him when he resisted. He also fought with her and beat her brutally. In the meantime, Hussain’s father Akbar was also supposed to come to live with him and he found a new house and shifted there.\nShe got pregnant and had abortions The female stated that she got pregnant and Hussain gave her medicines to abort the baby. She then conceived again and he did the same. Afterwards, Hussain, his brother Feroze and his wife brought her to the hospital after she became pregnant for the third time to discuss abortion but she rejected and came back home. She also accused Akbar of molesting her, in the complaint along with the physical and psychological abuse she endured at the hands of Hussain. He beat her whenever she raised the matter of marriage and ordered her to kill the baby in her womb first.\nDistraught, she eventually moved back to her home and threatened to file a police complaint after which he came to live with her. Meanwhile, she gave birth to a son in July of last year. She once more brought up marriage and he barked, “You didn’t listen to me and didn’t get an abortion,” and left her. She also spoke to her family but even they didn’t support her after which she registered a complaint on 9th May.\nShe voiced that Hussain’s family beat and tortured and threatened to kill her if she notified the authorities. She also mentioned that he had also extorted 9-10 lakh from her. She even alleged that he had seduced other Hindu girls as well.\nAnjar police registered a case, LCB is investigating The Anjar police have filed cases against six people including Hussain, his brother and father, Sameer and his wife and Feroze under Sections 376(2)(n), 328, 354, 323, and 114 of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 83 of the Juvenile Justice Act in response to the victim’s allegation. According to reports, after the matter came to light, Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghvi has also taken cognizance and transferred the case to the Local Crime Branch (LCB). Currently, the police are investigating the matter.\n",

    "title": "Researchers make alarming discovery after examining lettuce plant cells: 'It will definitely be a challenge'",
    "text": "Two Rutgers-led studies have found that microplastics increase the absorption of other pollutants such as arsenic into plants and human cells, raising food safety concerns.\nWhat's happening? The first study , summarized by AZO Cleantech , found that exposing lettuce plants to nanoplastics increased their absorption of arsenic. The smaller particles had the greatest impact, increasing arsenic content in edible tissues nearly threefold compared to lettuce that had been exposed to arsenic alone.\nThe news site explained that a second study found that nanoplastic particles increased arsenic absorption by nearly 600% compared to arsenic exposure alone in a human small intestine cellular model and lab-based gastrointestinal system. They found a similar effect with a widely used pesticide called boscalid.\nDo you think we use too much plastic in America?\nDefinitely 👍\nOnly some people 😅\nNot really 👎\nI'm not sure 🤷\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\nWhy are these studies important? These new papers offer more insight into the impact of microplastics, which can be found everywhere — from the bottom of the sea to our brains , where they have been shown to reduce blood flow and impair bodily movements. Research suggests these tiny plastic particles could be linked to a growing number of health issues, including cardiovascular disease and decreased fertility .\nWhat's being done about microplastics? Microplastics are formed as larger plastics degrade over time. As such, the research team advocates for reducing the amount of plastics we use as a society. For essential plastics, such as weed control covers used in agriculture, they advocate for biodegradable options. To that end, a number of plastic alternatives are gaining traction .\nScientists are also finding new ways to break down plastics before they become a problem. For instance, researchers are looking at how they can employ the assistance of hungry wax worms , whose saliva contains two enzymes that can break down polyethylene — the most commonly used plastic in the world — in just a few hours. Meanwhile, one group of researchers has found a way to remove microplastics from farm soil using a type of processed farm waste.\nWatch now: Could this concentrate replace all the toxic cleaning chemicals in your home? \"It is not that technically we cannot address some of these issues,\" the study's senior author Philip Demokritou said, per AZO Cleantech. \"But it will definitely be a challenge to retain all the benefits from this very useful material while reducing the harm that it does. There are social and economic obstacles related to plastic production and use to overcome.\"\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

With this growth, the team size has expanded by 20% since January 2023 and broadened its operations to Singapore. AlphaSense now looks towards the timeline for launching an Initial Public Offering (IPO).\nTo aid in this process, Heather Zynczak, previously with software company Pluralsight, has joined AlphaSense as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), bringing to bear her experience and expertise to guide the company’s impending IPO.\nCEO Kokko credits AlphaSense’s inception and growth to his early experience during the dotcom boom and the innovations in generative AI technology. Further, he views the diverse dataset offered by the platform as its key advantage. Kokko gives particular credit to large language models like Anthropic’s Claude 3 model for contributing significantly to the company’s rapid expansion.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) New Delhi, Nov 15 (IANS) Children born to women who take antiseizure medications during pregnancy may be at an increased risk of facing neurodevelopmental conditions, according to a large study on Friday.\nThe findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, showed that children exposed to antiseizure drugs valproate, topiramate, and carbamazepine were linked to specific neurodevelopmental issues.\nHowever, those exposed to the antiseizure drug lamotrigine in utero were at no additional risk for autism or intellectual disability, said researchers at Drexel University.\nThe team included data from more than three million children from the United Kingdom and Sweden, including 17,495 who were exposed to antiseizure medications during pregnancy.\nThey found that children exposed to topiramate during pregnancy were 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disability, which raises their risk to 2.1 per cent by age 12. Yet, the researchers cautioned that the absolute risk of neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring is low.\n“Our findings suggest that while certain medications may pose some risk, lamotrigine may be a less risky option,” said Brian K. Lee, Professor at the Dornsife School of Public Health.\n“Active monitoring of any antiseizure medication is critical to ensure safety and effectiveness, particularly during pregnancy,” Lee said.\nThe researchers noted that the study does not argue against the use of antiseizure medications in patients who benefit, but encourages them to have a conversation with their doctor to determine if their course of treatment is most appropriate for them.\n“Decisions should be made that are tailored to individual patients,” said co-lead author Paul Madley-Dowd, a research fellow at the University of Bristol.“Stopping antiseizure medications can cause individual harm and harm to offspring, so these conversations always need to happen with a clinician.”\nMENAFN15112024000231011071ID1108889895",

    "text": "Un conductor kamikaze cruza a pocos metros del coche de Kamala Harris en Wisconsin\nEl suceso ocurrió el pasado lunes cuando la caravana de la candidata demócrata circulaba por la carretera Interestatal 94. El conductor fue detenido al dar positivo en el test de alcoholemia.\nUn conductor ebrio que iba en sentido contrario pasó a pocos metros de la caravana de la vicepresidenta y candidata demócrata, Kamala Harris, después de un acto de su campaña electoral en Wisconsin. Harris acababa de terminar una comparecencia en un suburbio de la ciudad de Milwaukee el lunes por la noche cuando su comitiva se encontró con una camioneta que viajaba en sentido contrario en la carretera Interestatal 94. Los agentes seguían a la caravana de la candidata demócrata interceptaron el vehículo y detuvieron al conductor. Las autoridades dicen que el sospechoso, un hombre de Milwaukee de 55 años, fue arrestado después de dar positivo en una prueba de alcohol.\nDiscurso de cierre de campaña\nAfortunadamente, todo quedó en un susto y la conducta irresponsable del kamikaze terminó sin heridos.\nLa vicepresidenta de Estados Unidos y candidata demócrata a la Presidencia continúa con su periplo electoral y pronunciará el martes que viene su discurso de cierre de campaña en el Elipse, parque que se encuentra frente a la Casa Blanca y donde su rival republicano, el expresidente Donald Trump, pronunció el discurso que precedió al asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021.\nUna semana antes de la cita electoral, Harris utilizará su discurso principal para contrastar su visión de la Presidencia de la de su rival, aprovechando la ocasión para denunciar la idoneidad de Trump para el cargo, según han podido saber algunos medios estadounidenses, entre ellos la cadena de televisión estadounidense CNN.\nDespués de perder las elecciones de 2020, Trump intentó convencer a sus partidarios de que había ganado durante un discurso desde la puerta de la Casa Blanca en el que dijo a sus simpatizantes que marcharan hacia el Capitolio para presionar a los legisladores para que anularan la elección mientras se reunían en una sesión conjunta del Congreso para certificar formalmente la victoria del ahora presidente, Joe Biden.\nHarris ha invocado en varias ocasiones durante su campaña electoral el asalto al Capitolio como parte de su argumento de que la democracia está en juego. De hecho, este miércoles ha dicho que está de acuerdo con la evaluación de que Trump es un fascista, remarcando que algunas personas que trabajaron con él \"lo han llamado no apto y peligroso\".",

    "text": "Recommended Stories\nMegastar Amitabh Bachchan shared an anecdote about the veteran actress Helen, and talked about how she had escaped from the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1943, during the World War 2, and came to India.\nHelen is a well known dancer and is known for her character roles. Born in Rangoon, Burma (now known as Myanmar),\nHelen’s family trekked to Dibrugarh, Assam in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma.\nLater on, Helen got her major break at the age of 19 in 1958, when she performed on the song 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' in the movie ‘Howrah Bridge’.\nWith legendary actor Shammi Kapoor, she did many hit dance numbers like 'Suku Suku' in 'Junglee', 'Yamma Yamma' in 'China Town', and 'O Haseena Zulfonwali' in 'Teesri Manzil'.\nAmitabh, who is currently hosting the quiz based reality show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati 15’ welcomed the roll over contestant Lalit Kumar to the hot seat.\nFor Rs 25 lakh, he was asked: “Which of these actresses was born in Myanmar and later escaped with her family to India during the Second World War?”\nThe options given were -- Sulochana, Suraiya, Nadira, and Helen. The correct answer was Helen.\nHowever, Lalit was not sure about the answer, hence he decided to quit the show, and took the price money of Rs 12,50,000.\nAmitabh then went on to say, “Helen and her family escaped Myanmar...called Burma back then. In order to escape and come to India, they had to trek alternately through miles of wilderness passing through rivers, mountains and forests. In order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma, she had to do this in 1943.”\n“She became a popular actress in our film industry. Watching her dance would leave one enthralled,” shared the ‘Brahmastra’ actor.\nHelen has shared screen with Big B in the movies like ‘Mohabbatein’, ‘Don’, ‘Sholay’, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’, ‘The Great Gambler’ and ‘Ram Balram’.\nIn the movie ‘Sholay’, she had a special appearance in the track ‘Mehbooba Mehbooba’.\nTalking about the same, Amitabh added: “I had the good fortune of working with her in a few films. She's a kind and compassionate woman. She used to look after everyone. We pray she stays in good health. She's old now.”",

    "text": "MACOMB TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WXYZ) — Parents in Macomb County are voicing their concerns after a student was arrested at L’anse Creuse High School North.\nThe Wayne County Prosecutor's office confirms 16-year-old Ryan Sinegal of Roseville was taken into custody on April 1st and charged the next day with first-degree murder, two counts of assault with intent to murder, and three counts of felony firearm.\nPolice say back in February of 2024, the teen shot up another teen's car near the border of Detroit and Grosse Point Park, killing him. While police arrested Sinegal in connection with the 17-year-old victim's death last June, Sinegal was released and allowed to return to school for the 2024-2025 school year.\n\"They dropped the ball,\" said Jacqueline Weinmann, who has a student at the high school. \"Every day I have to read posts on Facebook about what has gone on with this student and my child has been there and it’s scary.\"\nUpon Sinegal's return to school, the student was required to use a clear backpack according to school board officials.\nFollowing Sinegal's second arrest in connection with the case last week, the district sent out the letter below:\nGood afternoon LCPS,\nThis past week has been the most heartbreaking and difficult since I began my time in LCPS. For those\nwho are not aware, on Tuesday, April 1, 2025, an LCHS-North student was arrested and charged with\nhomicide. Based on information received, this tragic event took place in February of 2024 and did not\ninvolve any other LCPS students.\nThe following recaps the events that took place on April 1st:\nAt approximately 9:00 a.m., law enforcement appeared on campus to serve a warrant for the student’s arrest. At that time, the school initiated a Hold, which remained in place for approximately 20 minutes. A hold is a precautionary safety protocol used to keep students in their classrooms and clear the hallways. This protocol allows staff and, when necessary, emergency personnel to address a situation calmly and efficiently, minimizing disruption to learning. We did not share this information with families right away because we were working closely with law enforcement to manage the situation in real time.\nThe student did not resist the arrest, there were no weapons present, and law enforcement handled the situation professionally and safely.\nAt the same time the arrest occurred—and completely unrelated to the law enforcement matter—there was a separate medical emergency on campus that required EMS support. The arrival of emergency medical personnel and a fire truck led to some confusion and rumors. We want to clarify that their presence was not connected to the arrest. EMS and the fire truck were responding solely to the medical situation.\nSince Tuesday, we have felt the weight of emotions shared by our students, staff, families, and board members. These emotions reflect just how deeply we all care for one another and for the safety of our schools. Please know that our number one priority is, and will continue to be, providing a safe and supportive environment for every student. I am working closely with our leadership team and seeking\nlegal guidance to ensure we are handling this situation responsibly and in accordance with all necessary\nprotocols. Our goal is not only to manage the current circumstances with diligence, but to always look\nfor ways to strengthen the systems that keep our schools safe.\nAlthough this event occurred at one school, we recognize that the safety of every student in L’Anse Creuse Public Schools is a shared concern across the entire community. This recent situation has prompted important questions from our community regarding our student enrollment process, disciplinary procedures, and search and seizure practices. We appreciate families engaging in these conversations, and we understand the desire for clarity and transparency.\nAs a public school district, we follow established procedures aligned with state and federal law. These processes are outlined in our board-approved policies and administrative guidelines.\nSince my arrival in LCPS, I’ve been working closely with school buildings, departments, and focus groups\nto gather input and assess current practices. For the past several weeks, we have been preparing to launch a district-wide safety audit survey for families, staff, and students. We expect to move forward\nwith the survey later this month. The goal of the survey is to collect meaningful feedback that will help\nus strengthen and refine our safety systems moving forward. Your feedback will help us strengthen our\npractices and reinforce a sense of security and trust across all LCPS schools. This survey will be released\nin the coming weeks.\nThese are heavy and unsettling times. But please know this: student safety is and will always be our\nhighest priority. Thank you for your continued partnership and support of L’Anse Creuse Public Schools.\nKeith Howell\nSuperintendent\nParents say they were left in the dark until last week and are now calling the circumstances unsettling.\n\"Let us know last year that this was going on, so we can make the decision where we want to send our child this year. You don’t have to give us names, you don’t have to give us what they did,\" said Weinmann. \"It’s going to keep being on my mind until we get some answers. Call a meeting. Let us know. Don’t send an email with chopped words. Let us know what you’re going to do different.\"\nWednesday 7 News Detroit reached out to the school district superintendent, Keith Howell, for an interview and showed up at the administrative offices, but he was not available. The district sent back the following statement.\nAt L’Anse Creuse Public Schools, our number one priority is the safety and security of our students, staff, and community. On April 1, local law enforcement served a warrant for one of our students, who was later charged in connection with a 2024 homicide that occurred off school property. No other L’Anse Creuse student or member of our school community is involved in these criminal allegations. The student is currently in police custody. We are closely monitoring the situation and conducting an internal review with our legal counsel, as well as a thorough safety audit. We will provide updates when information is appropriate and available to share.\nL'Anse Creuse Spokesperson\n\"We’re in the business of not just educating our children, but we're in the business of keeping them safe while they’re being educated, and that’s where we really failed,\" said Sandra Hernden, who is a member of the district's board of education.\nHernden says following the letter sent to parents, she heard from several parents, staff members, and students describing what it was like in the halls with the suspected shooter. Although Hernden is a trustee, she spoke to 7 News Detroit Wednesday as a parent who also has students in the district.\n\"I think from here, we’re going to really have to look at policy and procedure moving forward. We're going to have to put in some sort of district safety measures. We're going to have to, at the end of the day, offer transparency,\" said Hernden.\nSinegal is due back in court for a probable cause conference April 16th. He is expected to be tried as an adult. If convicted of his current charges, he faces life in prison.",
