    "title": "Comment on Chocolate Baked Donuts by Ricky",
    "text": "I love chocolate. Maybe you can relate? Sometimes, I find myself in the mood to bake something rich and chocolatey, but I don’t necessarily want an entire cake sitting around at my house (a dangerous situation for someone who is home as much as me, ha).\nThese chocolate baked donuts are the perfect treat. They are ultra rich but not necessarily overly sweet (check out my\nbaked cinnamon apple donuts if chocolate isn’t your thing).\nThe baked donuts are a spongey, moist cake and then they get topped with a chocolate glaze (and\nsprinkles if you’re fun). But, the recipe below only yields six baked donuts— a standard pan size. But, if you want to make a dozen, just double the recipe.\nI used\n“special dark” cocoa for the donuts photographed here, so they look especially dark. But any baking cocoa will do well for these chocolate baked donuts.\nMake sure to lightly butter or spray your pan before filling.\nYou could absolutely top these chocolate baked donuts with a different glaze or even nothing at all, and they are still a fun treat. Happy baking! xo.

In a smaller, separate bowl, stir together the wet ingredients: milk, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.\n- Stir the wet ingredients in with the dry until no lumps remain. Lightly butter or spray the donut baking pan before spooning the batter in.\n- Bake at 350°F for 14-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan before turning out onto a cooling rack.\n- For the glaze, in a medium pot over medium heat, melt the butter and stir in the cream or milk, corn syrup, and vanilla. Add the chocolate chips, turning the heat down slightly if needed, and continue to cook and stir until the chips are melted.\n- Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the powdered sugar. You may want to shift the sugar first, to remove any lumps, so your glaze will be lump-free.\n- Dip the donuts in the still-warm glaze, tapping off any extra. Then, top with sprinkles if using.\nNutrition\nNotice: Nutrition is auto-calculated, using Spoonacular, for your convenience. Where relevant, we recommend using your own nutrition calculations.",

    "text": "TLAJOMULCO, Jal; 18 de abril de 2024.- El candidato de Movimiento Ciudadano a la alcaldía de Tlajomulco, Gerardo Quirino Velázquez visitó la zona Valle del municipio donde prometió mejorar las condiciones de las principales avenidas y construir la avenida Poliducto, con la que el gobierno pretende agilizar el tráfico vehicular.\nDesde el reemplazo de luminarias LED en las calles, hasta el bacheo y habilitación de infraestructura en concreto hidráulico de avenida Estrella y calle Morelos, vialidades que son el acceso principal hacia la zona valle y conectan con prolongación Jesús Michel González, Quirino apostará por mejorar la Zona Valle.\n«La Zona Valle es la que tiene más posibilidades de desarrollo y crecimiento. Hoy, después de muchos años, ya es una realidad la línea 4 del Tren Ligero, que es una obra muy importante para la movilidad. Vamos a hacer un atlas de todos los riesgos que guardan nuestras calles, para iniciar un proceso de reconstrucción por etapas», abundó el candidato.\nEn el caso de la avenida Poliducto conectará el corredor de la avenida López Mateos hasta carretera a Chapala, pasando por la zona Valle.\nEn materia de educación, Velázquez Chávez hizo mención de la consolidación de la nueva preparatoria que estará ubicada sobre avenida Concepción, al ingreso del fraccionamiento Villas de la Hacienda, con la que se verán beneficiados miles de alumnos de nuevo ingreso.\nPor último, la ampliación de la planta potabilizadora de Villas de la Hacienda y la construcción de la segunda etapa del colector sanitario, son obras que también beneficiarán a vecinos de este lugar y fraccionamientos aledaños, que cuentan con irregularidades en el suministro de agua potable.",

    "text": "Indecent exposure in Brampton rec centre changerooms continues, and staff couldn't care less Recently, a handful of mothers got in touch with Rebel News to say there is a disturbing situation going on in the all-gender changeroom at the Earnscliffe Recreation Centre, which is to say, mature men are exposing themselves to their young daughters on a regular basis. The Earnscliffe Recreation Centre in Brampton, Ont., is back in the news — and again, it’s for all the wrong reasons. Astute viewers of Rebel News might recall that this is the very same rec centre where we caught [Sneaky Patrick Brown playing hockey with his buddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4F4Jqr0bE8) when all the other rec centres and parks in the city were locked down during COVID-19. Yes, one law for thee, one law for the mayor of Brampton. What a hypocrite and a reprobate. But recently a handful of mothers got in touch with Rebel News to say there is a disturbing situation going on in the all-gender changeroom at Earnscliffe. Which is to say, mature men are exposing themselves to their young daughters on a regular basis. This is not supposed to happen, of course. Those getting changed are supposed to use the enclosed cubicles, but certain individuals are doffing their clothes in the common areas as a way to expose their genitals to minors. It’s equal parts gross and disturbing. Even more disturbing: the mothers say their complaints to rec centre staff and city officials fall on deaf ears. \"There will be no more women's spaces.\"— The Democracy Fund (@TDF_Can) [@preta_6]at the Protecting Women's Spaces In The Age of Transgenderism event in Toronto. Watch more from this event here: [https://t.co/GPqjQVJcFy] [pic.twitter.com/xjjRlO8HBS] [February 14, 2023] Indeed, when we went to the Earnscliffe Recreation Centre recently to interview the mothers, staff called security — not on those indecently exposing themselves, but on Rebel News and the concerned mothers! Please note that we were conducting our interviews outside the rec centre and not bothering patrons nor employees. Nevertheless, we were frog-marched to the public sidewalk via Mayor Brown’s version of the Praetorian Guard. But get this: after doing the interviews, we discovered that earlier this year an Earnscliffe employee was criminally charged with voyeurism! In response to David Menzies question about the war on women's spaces, Poilievre says, \"Female sports, female change rooms, female bathrooms should be for females, not for biological males.”— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) [https://t.co/AY8uVnnJxa] [pic.twitter.com/8Q78o9GW5o] [February 21, 2024] City News [reports](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/02/02/brampton-rec-centre-employee-charged-in-voyeurism-investigation/) that a 20-year-old man was put in custody in connection with multiple incidents of voyeurism over a two-month period. The employee allegedly followed numerous women into the washroom; one woman reported that he was allegedly filming her. Michael Nicolas stands charged with eight counts of voyeurism. Rebel News reached out to the City of Brampton, but no comment was forthcoming. Then again, little wonder why the staff at Earnscliffe have been so hostile to both mothers and members of the media. After all, could there be other staffers also engaged in illicit behaviour at this rec centre, too? Don't Get Censored Big Tech is censoring us. Sign up so we can always stay in touch.

The incident, which allegedly occurred on the premises of the Crane Hotel, has drawn the ire of the Barbados Muslim Association, whose president, Anwar Nana, is calling on the owner of the St Philip hotel to condemn the action. In the video, a person with a foreign accent can be heard saying, “Here comes the Islamist invasion, pretending to be human,” in reference to the family, some of whom were wearing “Free Palestine” T-shirts. Nana told the Weekend Nation that a strong message needed to be sent that such acts of intolerance would not be allowed in Barbados.

    "text": "Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman S Somnath has outlined India's ambitious space plans while speaking at IIT Bombay's TechFest. This strategy envisions a bold leap into lunar economics and a significant expansion in satellite deployment.\n\"After the success of Chandrayan-3, there is a huge demand for what is next for ISRO in the coming 25 years. We have a roadmap for what we have planned till 2047 ,\" ANI quoted the ISRO chief as saying. “We can build a space station, we can send human beings to the moon, and we can create moon-based economic activity in space.\"\nCheck out: After Success Of Chandrayaan-3, Aditya L1, ISRO Sets Eyes On Other Planets | Details\nISRO has plans for a major expansion of its satellite fleet. The objective is to enhance India's geo-intelligence capabilities. The ISRO chairman emphasised the need for a tenfold increase in the current fleet size to strengthen national security and surveillance. Over the next five years, ISRO plans to launch 50 satellites , equipped with advanced technologies, including AI, to optimise data analysis and reduce unnecessary data transmission.\nBorder surveillance\nThis fleet will be strategically placed in various orbits, from geostationary to lower earth orbits. Their purpose is multifaceted, ranging from troop movement monitoring to extensive border surveillance. This capability will allow India to cover vast areas and respond more effectively to potential threats.\n\"This capability gives us enormous potential. We have been launching satellites to handle this, but there is a different way of thinking now and we need to look at it in a much more critical manner because the power of (any) nation is the ability to understand what is happening around it,\" PTI quoted Somanath as saying.\nThe ISRO chief also highlighted the importance of interconnected satellite communication. This network will enable swift information sharing between satellites in different orbits, enhancing real-time monitoring and assessment.\n(With agency inputs)",

    "text": "How Low Can They Go?\nAT&T and Verizon continue to aggressively eliminate staff. You have to wonder where the bottom will be in staffing levels. Both companies are currently actively striving to eliminate copper networks, with Verizon is much further along with this effort than AT&T. However, Verizon is slated to merge with Frontier sometime this year, which will bring new employees and a return of a lot of copper networks that Verizon had ditched to Frontier in the past. Both companies also say they are considering how AI might streamline operations, which probably means even further cuts in staffing over the next few years. This is all a far cry from the time when AT&T was the telephone monopoly and had over 1 million employees, making it the biggest employer outside the U.S. military. It’s anybody’s guess how much more these companies can slash staff and remain viable.\nHow Low Can They Go?",
