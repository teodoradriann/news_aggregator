    "text": "A hot potato: As expected, all the companies that make it hard for you to cancel service are throwing cases to the courts over the FTC's C2C rule. The amendment to the Negative Options Rule of 1973 severely hampers a service provider's ability to keep you and your credit card on the books. Lobbyists are pulling out a coordinated effort to ice the reg.\nTelecom, advertising, and newspaper lobbying groups have filed multiple lawsuits to block the Federal Trade Commission's adoption of its newly approved \"Click-to-Cancel\" regulation. It's not surprising considering that these same groups were contending that the rule is a disservice to consumers because they are more likely to cancel their services accidentally. That argument has since morphed into a more valid reason – it limits their ability to give the customer the hard sell when they want to cancel service.\nAccording to the lawsuit filed jointly by the cable lobbying group NCTA and the Interactive Advertising Bureau in the Fifth Circuit Court, the rule limits a firm's ability to talk customers out of canceling their cable or other services. They also contend that the rule outsteps the FTC's authority and violates the service provider's First Amendment protections.\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals Petition via CourtListener\nA second suit, filed in the Sixth Circuit by the Michigan Press Association and National Federation of Independent Business, uses identical language to the other lawsuit. Ars Technica notes that this is likely a coordinated effort between lobbying groups.\nBoth filings read:\n\"The Final Rule is an attempt to regulate consumer contracts for all companies in all industries and across all sectors of the economy in which the customer purchases a service or subscription that will continue unless the customer exercises the option to cancel. The Final Rule calls these \"negative option\" contracts – estimated as covering over a billion paid subscriptions in the United States – and deems them all to be deceptive unless they comply with onerous new regulatory obligations regarding disclosures, how those disclosures are communicated, a \"separate\" consent requirement, regulations of truthful company representative communications with customers, and prescriptive mandates for service cancellation, among others.\"\nAll plaintiffs agree that the \"negative option\" rule complicates things more for the consumer since companies cannot receive cancellation feedback and adjust their services accordingly. Situations, where the customer does not understand that there are other options, go unaddressed because the FTC is essentially gagging service providers with the rule. The rule also bans auto-renewing trials and subscriptions unless customers explicitly state they want to renew after the trial or subscription period concludes.\nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals Petition via CourtListener\nWhen identical lawsuits appear like this, the courts do not hear them separately. Generally, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation selects a court at random to hold the case. The Fifth and Sixth Circuits are both considered conservative courts, so it is unclear what the lobbyists' end run is. The FTC approved the regulation in a 3-2 final vote along party lines, with a conservative commissioner voting against it.\n// Related Stories Arm vs Qualcomm: mutually assured destruction FTC \"Click-to-Cancel\" mandate targets annoying subscription traps It is also not likely a stalling tactic since the rule does not kick in until six months after federal registration. The groups could be attempting to drag out the hearing. However, it's not likely that judges will allow frivolous stalling shenanigans so long as the FTC can prove it has the authority to enact the regulation.\nWhile the FTC has not yet commented on the lawsuits, it has previously asserted that it has the power to implement the rule under Section 18 of the FTC Act. That part of the law states that the FTC has legal authority to propose and approve rules defining \"unfair or deceptive practices\" and to implement regulations that address these actions in the consumer's interest.\nImage credit: Alpha Photo\n9 comments 411 likes and shares",

    "text": "If you liked Poor Things, good news. Hot off the heals of Emma Stone’s Best Actress Oscar win on Sunday, she and director Yorgos Lanthimos already have a date set for their next movie together. It’s coming out this summer, and it’s called Kinds of Kindness. Searchlight Pictures, which also distributed Poor Things, announced Thursday that the film will be released in theaters on June 21. The plot of Kinds of Kindness has not yet been revealed. It will be Lanthimos and Stone’s third feature film together following Poor Things and 2018’s The Favourite. Stone was also in Lanthimos’ 2022 short “Bleat.” Kinds of Kindness will also have multiple others alums from Poor Things in it, including Willem Dafoe, who played Godwin Baxter, the mad-scientist who brings Stone’s character Bella Baxter back to life with unorthodox methods. In one of the film’s funniest recurring bits, Bella lovingly refers to Godwin as “God.” Kinds of Kindness Stars Emma Stone and Other Poor Things Alums In 2023, Dafoe played an art thief who goes completely feral when he becomes trapped in the luxury apartment he’s trying to rob in Vasilis Katsoupis’ feature directorial debut [Inside](https://www.moviemaker.com/willem-dafoe-inside/). That year, he was also in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City and voiced a character in Hayao Miyazaki’s Oscar-winning Studio Ghibli animated movie The Boy and the Heron. Another actor returning forKinds of Kindness who was also in Poor Things is Margaret Qualley. She had a smaller but still important role as Felicity, Godwin’s second human woman science experiment. Last week, it was announced that Qualley will also [play Amanda Knox](https://www.moviemaker.com/margaret-qualley-amanda-knox-hulu/) in a new Hulu limited series about the woman exonerated after being wrongly convicted of murdering her roommate in Italy in 2007. Also Read: [Ridley Scott: Things I’ve Learned as a Moviemaker](https://www.moviemaker.com/ridley-scott-things-ive-learned-as-a-moviemaker/) Other stars who have been announced from the cast of Kinds of Kindness include Joe Alwyn, who was in Lanthimos’ 2018 drama The Favourite. He played Samuel Masham, a baron in the court of Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne. Colman won the Oscar for Best Actress for the role. Killers of the Flower Moon and Power of the Dog actor Jesse Plemons will also be in Kinds of Kindness, as will The Whale, Asteroid City and The Menu actress Hong Chau, Euphoria and The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes actress Hunter Schafer, and The Boy and the Heron and Jurassic World Dominion actor Mamoudou Athie. In her acceptance speech for Best Actress in Poor Things at the Oscars on Sunday, Stone thanked Lanthimos for casting her as Bella Baxter, and for providing her some moral support going into the awards ceremony. Many had expected Killers of the Flower Moon actress Lily Gladstone to win the Best Actress award, which would have made her the first Native American to ever win an Oscar. In Stone’s acceptance speech, she acknowledged that she was afraid of winning the award — her second Best Actress Oscar following her win for 2016’s La La Land — instead of Gladstone. “The other night, I was panicking, as you can kind of see happens a lot, that maybe something like this could happen, and Yorgos said to me, ‘Please take yourself out of it.’ And he was right, because it’s not about me, it’s about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts,” [Stone said Sunday](https://youtu.be/XDYBUnCqsyw). “That is the best part about making movies, is all of us together. And I am so deeply honored to share this with every cast member, with every crew member, with every single person who poured their love and their care and their brilliance into the making of this film. And [Yorgos], thank you for the gift of a lifetime in Bella Baxter. I am forever thankful for you. Thank you for inviting all of us to be members of this team.” Lanthimos’ other films include 2015’s The Lobster, 2009’s Dogtooth, and 2017’s The Killing of a Sacred Deer.
