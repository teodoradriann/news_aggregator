    "text": "O fficials in an Illinois county put up signs along exits on Interstate 55 telling migrant buses they were not welcome in the area over the holiday weekend. The move comes as more Chicago suburbs take strides to prevent the city's influx of immigrants from overflowing into their towns.\nGrundy County, which recently passed a resolution declaring it a “non- sanctuary county for immigration,” placed two digital signs along I-55's northbound exits by Dwight and Gardner that read \"NO MIGRANT BUSES THIS EXIT\" on Saturday. The signs went up in response to reports of buses dropping off asylum-seekers in other nearby communities, Grundy County Sheriff Ken Briley said to the .\nHOUSE PREPARES FOR EARLY 2024 SHAKE-UP WITH SLEW OF SPECIAL ELECTIONS\n“We wanted to get us through the holiday weekend so we didn’t run into the unfortunate circumstances of having these people dropped in rural Grundy County with no place to go,” Briley said.\nThe sheriff said no buses stopped in the county, the signs have been removed, and there are no plans to put them back up. He said an emergency plan was in place to take migrants to Joliet if any ended up in Grundy County. Joliet police and Will County emergency management would coordinate to direct migrants to trains bound for Chicago.\n“If someone got lost or thought by mistake that this was Chicago, those signs were a directory,” Grundy County State’s Attorney Russell Baker said. “We thought the signs could persuade bus drivers, if lost, to keep going on I-55 to places that are equipped to handle [migrants].”\nKankakee officials reported that four days before Christmas, a bus dropped off 30 to 40 migrants at a gas station around 4:30 a.m. Three hours later, police showed up to find people wrapped in blankets, with some staying at the gas station while others were spotted walking on the highway.\n“The passengers, hailing from Venezuela, were left without money, food, adequate clothing, and were under the impression that they had reached their destination,” the Kankakee County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement .\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThis is the latest event involving immigrants filtering into Chicago suburbs. Naperville, Aurora, Fox River Grove, Elmhurst, and Cicero are among the towns and villages that have witnessed busloads of migrants arriving in recent weeks. Several of the suburbs are rejecting the buses, threatening to fine or impound them if they drop off homeless immigrants. Villages of Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village have passed ordinances preventing illegal immigrants from being housed in hotels, and Oak Park is now evicting 150 immigrants living in the town's hotel and YMCA.\nGrundy County passed its \"non-sanctuary\" status resolution two weeks ago, rededicating its \"limited resources\" to residents in need, such as seniors, veterans, homeless people, and those living below the poverty line.\nLatest New Hampshire 9-year-old calls Nikki Haley 'the new John Kerry' to her face By: Jenny Goldsberry\nRecent backlash against Nikki Haley proves 'momentum': Tiana Lowe Doescher By: Jenny Goldsberry\nChris Christie's conceit By: Varad Mehta Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

    "title": "Movie Man: “An American Bombing” Documentary",
    "text": "Thursday, April 18th 2024, 3:18 pm A new documentary is showing how the Oklahoma standard was born 29 years ago. April 19 marks the day our state and nation were changed forever following the Murrah Building Bombing. The documentary is called \"An American Bombing: The Road to April 19th.\" While this documentary was at times difficult to watch, our Movie Man cannot emphasize enough the importance of why everyone needs to see it. “An American Bombing” is a gut-wrenching and terrifying documentary. It dives into the heartbreaking story of the most catastrophic act of domestic terrorism against the United States government in history. It’s a date we will certainly never forget. On the morning of April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked an explosive-laden Ryder truck in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The explosion killed 168 innocent people, including 19 children. The film painstakingly recounts the horrific events of that day, providing a moving window into the lives of survivors and the deep sorrow felt by the families of the victims. It takes viewers along as officials follow the relentless hunt for the criminals and the subsequent trials. The film also delves more into Timothy McVeigh’s life, his upbringing, his experiences after serving in the Gulf War, and his plunge into the dark realm of pro-gun and anti-government organizations. Oklahoma native Mike Boettcher is a consulting producer on the documentary, but he was a network correspondent for NBC News at the time who reported extensively on the bombing, as well as the aftermath. He said the film is aimed at a younger generation who doesn’t know anything about the Oklahoma City Bombing. “We wanted to tell that story because there are lessons to be learned, and those lessons are applicable today. Because we’re at a contentious period in this country, as we were in the mid-1990s with people going at each other from either side of the political spectrum,” Boettcher said. “And this documentary was meant to let people know we’re out of danger.” This is a must-see documentary, especially if you are trying to understand the complexities of homegrown terrorism. The emotionally charged and thought-provoking film examines one of the most distressing eras in American history with compelling interviews, historical information, and thorough research. It is a haunting testament to the human spirit’s fortitude in the face of unspeakable tragedy and a call to action to prevent similar crimes from occurring in the future. Mike Boettcher gives one last very important piece of advice: “Don’t forget. Don’t forget that day. It is an important part of American history that we aren’t paying attention to enough now because we’re going on as if this won’t happen again. Well, you know something? It can happen again.” An American Bombing: The Road to April 19th can be seen on both HBO and available to stream on Max. April 18th, 2024 April 18th, 2024 April 18th, 2024 April 18th, 2024",

    "text": "There’s nothing worse than being referred to as “vanilla” in the NFL. Just ask Pittsburgh Steelers offensive players.\nBut Mason Rudolph did just that when comparing Pittsburgh’s scout team defense to the Cincinnati Bengals starters.\nRudolph was asked if practicing against guys like T.J. Watt and Minkah Fitzpatrick benefited him during his years as a reserve.\n“Yeah, it’s a great group to work against,” Rudolph said in a Wednesday press conference . “You know, we employ so many sorts of pre-snap disguise that it makes you play every snap with a sort of keen sense of awareness of where the safeties are moving… where’s Minkah Fitzpatrick. That prepares you a lot for other teams, other looks.”\nThe Bengals’ defense wasn’t a concern for Rudolph as it was for him practicing against the Steelers.\n“And then when you get a team, Cincinnati was not using their disguise very well. When you get a team that’s maybe less, maybe more vanilla. You can take a breath and say, you know, I’ve seen harder looks at this in practice. So, one of the main benefits of playing here.”\nRudolph and Pickett both put up career numbers against Cincinnati’s 28th-ranked pass defense : Rudolph went 17-of-27 for 290 yards and two scores, and Pickett 24-of-33 for 278 yards. The offense would’ve had an even better outing the first time around if Diontae Johnson hadn’t dropped a touchdown and Jaylen Warren hadn’t fumbled in the red zone.\nMore Mason Rudolph Steelers preparing for Mason Rudolph to start vs. Chargers Steelers QB Mason Rudolph got rocked last season in Cleveland.
