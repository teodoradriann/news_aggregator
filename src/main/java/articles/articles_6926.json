    "text": "Community members, led by Republican elected officials in Bay Ridge, protest proposed cannabis dispensary\nBAY RIDGE — Chants of “no marijuana store” and “Bay Ridge says no” were heard loud and clear Monday morning as more than 100 Bay Ridge residents demonstrated their vehement opposition to the proposed opening of a marijuana dispensary on Third Avenue.\nAssemblyman Michael Tannousis (D-64), Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (D-11) and Alec Brook-Krasny (D-46) held a press conference in front of the planned cannabis dispensary located at 8412 Third Avenue, the former Pilo Arts hair salon. The proposed dispensary is 6,000 sq. feet and includes three storefronts.\nTannousis told the crowd that this was “the worst possible location” for a marijuana dispensary.\n“There are 8,000 students within a block and a half radius; children are walking back and forth to school daily here,” he said. “We demand that the NYS Office of Cannabis Management reject this ridiculous proposal.”\nIncidentally, Community Board 10 has recently voted against the proposal submitted by applicants RMAN Holdings LLC, citing proximity to five schools, two houses of worship and a children’s bookstore.\nCurrent cannabis laws prohibit retail licensees from having a storefront within 500 feet of a school or 200 feet of a house of worship.\nHowever, while RMAN Holdings LLC’s application technically meets these legal requirements, the board raised concerns about its proximity to Home Sweet Home Child Day Care Center (less than 500 feet), which is not classified as a school.\n“The Office of Cannabis Management has been a disaster from the minute that they passed recreational marijuana,” Tannousis said. “We are going to put pressure on their office and the governor’s office to prevent this from happening.”\nMalliotakis addressed the crowd next, pointing out that it is unacceptable that the proposal is under consideration in such a residential neighborhood.\n“We do not want this 6,000-square-foot dispensary cannabis superstore in the middle of Bay Ridge,” Malliotakis said. “We must be vocal, we must be heard, and we need to stop it. It will hurt the children, the taxpayers, the residents of the area — and the quality of life in our community.”\nBrook-Krasny, the third speaker at the event, explained, “The smell of marijuana on every corner of this city is a sign of degradation of this great society.”\nHe also referred to cannabis as a “gateway drug.”\n“Yes, there is medicinal marijuana, and I understand that it helps some people who need it,” Brook-Krasny noted. “But recreational cannabis is the worst possible law that we can have in this state. Can we reverse this law? Of course, we can — and we will!”\nBay Ridge local Paul Leonardo has lived in the neighborhood for more than 50 years and is opposed to the proposed dispensary.\n“I raised my kids here; my grandkids are here,” Leonardos said. “This is our neighborhood. Why do they want to destroy our neighborhood? We don’t need something like this in our backyard.”\nSixteen-year-old Omar Marea, a Bay Ridge resident, said despite his peers using marijuana, he chooses to abstain.\n“It’s been a real annoyance for me,” Marae explained. “My living room at night smells like weed, and I have to say that enough is enough. A dispensary here would be a huge mistake.”\nRichie Barsamian, chair of the Kings County Republican Party, attended the press conference but did not speak publicly. He told the Brooklyn Eagle, “If this proposal goes through, it will destroy our quality of life and entice our children.”\n“This is not where we need this type of store,” Barsamian said. “If [RMAN Holdings] wants to be responsible and do what is right, they should go to an industrial area instead.”\nRMAN Holdings had not responded with comments by press deadline.\nAfter the press conference concluded, several protesters made their way to the office of Councilmember Justin Brannan, shouting, “Bay Ridge says no.” They pasted flyers on his office doors and windows reading “No marijuana dispensary near our kids” and “No marijuana dispensary near our schools.”\nWhile Brannan declined to comment, he referred to the protesters’ actions as “unacceptable behavior for concerned citizens” in a Facebook post.",

    "title": "Politico Reporter on MSNBC Frets That Christian Nationalists Believe Americans' Rights Come From God, Not the Government (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit | by Mike LaChance",
    "text": "Heidi Przybyla, a reporter for Politico, appeared on MSNBC this week and fretted as she explained that Christian Nationalists believe that Americans’ rights are granted by God and not Congress or the Supreme Court. Leaving aside her ridiculous distinctions between Christian Nationalists and other Christians, the rights of Americans DO come from God and not the government, which anyone knows if they have read the country’s founding documents. How is this person even allowed to comment on politics on TV with this level of dishonesty or stupidity? This is a perfect example of why trust in the media is in the gutter. Transcript via Real Clear Politics: HEIDI PRZYBYLA: I talked with a lot of experts on this and I have seen it with my reporting, Michael, which is that the base of the Republican Party has shifted. Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainline evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced real estate mogul who cheated on his wife with a porn star, and all of that. So what happened was that he was surrounded by this more extremist element. We are going to hear words like Christian nationalism, like the “new apostolic reformation.” These are groups that you should get very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trump’s circle. And the one thing that unites all of them because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump. But the thing that unites them as Christian nationalists, not Christians because Christian nationalists are very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans and as all human beings do not come from any Earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, from the Supreme Court, they come from God. The problem with that is that they are determining, men, are determining what God is telling them. In the past, that so-called “natural law,” it is a pillar of catholicism for instance, it has been used for good in social justice campaigns. Martin Luther King evoked it in talking about civil rights. Watch the video: She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg — Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) February 23, 2024 It’s just stunning. These are the people who are driving the nation’s political news.",

    "title": "Paralympics: 'Kiwi ingenuity' helps hand cyclist Rory Mead to fourth",
    "text": "Kiwi hand cyclist Rory Mead shrugged off the wet and cold and an hour-long delay to record his best finish at the Paralympics.\nMead finished fourth in the men’s H1-2 road race in Paris which was one place better than his fifth-placed finish yesterday in the men's H2 individual time trial.\nThe weather played a key role in the day’s racing as heavy surface flooding caused the race start to be delayed by an hour, and reduced the race by a lap.\n“It was probably the wettest ride I’ve ever done, so we had to come up with a bit of Kiwi ingenuity and put plastic bags on my hands to keep dry,” said Mead.\n“In the moment when I was told the race was delayed by an hour, I was not too happy but looking back I’m glad they did because the weather did start to lift. I was also a fan of the reduced distance because it was cold out there.\"\nThe 37-year-old hand cyclist produced his best result at the Paralympics, completing the 42.6km course in a time of 1:40:34. Mead finished fifth in both of the events in Tokyo.\n“Fourth is my best so far at a Paralympic Games, but I don’t know if I’m going to be happy until I get on that podium.”\nDefending champion Florian Jouanny from France won the race with a time of 1:20:18, beating Spanish rider Spain’s Sergio Garrote Munoz by 22 seconds.\n“I quickly found myself alone in the race and then it was just a matter of survival,\" Mead said.\n\"Then I just tapped into all the training I’d done all year and rode the race to the finish line.”\nMead sustained a spinal cord injury in a motocross racing accident in 2014 in the US, but post-accident he discovered a passion for hand cycling.\nNew Zealand's hunt for a gold medal at the Games continues, but the Kiwi Para athletes have picked up seven medals so far (four silver, three bronze).\nAlso overnight, three Kiwi Para swimmers failed to make it past the heat stage in their respective events.\nTupou Neiufi competed in the women’s 50m freestyle and finished sixth in her heat with a time of 33.40 making her the 10th fastest across both heats, meaning she missed out on a place in the final.\n“This wasn’t really a strong race for me, but I guess this was about trying to get that redemption for myself and making sure I felt better after I hopped out of the pool,” said Neiufi.\nEarlier at the Games, Neiufi was aiming to defend her title in the women’s 100m backstroke S8, but she finished fifth in her heat and didn’t progress to the final.\n“I’m proud to make it here because there were a lot of questions about whether I would make the team or whether I wanted to be here in Paris because I had a lot of things going on in my life outside of the pool. Although the swims weren’t that great (at Paris 2024), I’m really proud to make it here.”\nChristchurch-based duo Gaby Smith and Lili-Fox Mason both lined up in the women’s 400m freestyle S10 but both couldn’t make it out of their heats.\n19-year-old Mason was in fourth at the 100m mark but slipped back to sixth, recording a time of 5:00.42 - just two-and-a-half seconds shy of her personal best.\n“I’m not super happy with the time I did this morning, it is not how I train to swim that race,” said Mason. “But it is my first (Paralympic) Games and it is super exciting to be in a field with a lot of talented competitors, I'm excited to see where I go from here.”\n18-year-old Smith is the youngest member of the NZ Paralympic Team in Paris, and finished sixth in heat two registering a time of 5:02.31. Smith still has one event left to compete in as she swims in the women’s 200m individual medley SM10.\nIn contrast, the oldest member of the NZ Paralympic team also competed on day eight with 62-year-old Greg Reid competing in qualification for the R6 Mixed 50m Rifle Prone SH1.\nHe finished 36th with a total score of 600.6pts and did not progress to the final.\nWatch the Paralympics live on TVNZ+ and TVNZ1 from August 29-September 9.",

    "title": "AVISO DANA BORRASCA | Una DANA y borrasca: los meteorólogos avisan de que después del buen tiempo llega lo peor",
    "text": "El ascenso generalizado de temperaturas que está experimentando España estos días tiene fecha de caducidad. Así lo avisan desde el portal especializado Meteored, asegurando que en las próximas horas una dorsal subtropical condicionará la situación meteorológica del país. Si bien quedan todavía cierto margen para que eso suceda, con el viernes y el sábado como fechas límite para que el mercurio en los termómetros toque techo (valores por encima de los 30 grados), a partir del domingo se comenzarán a notar las consecuencias de la llegada de una masa de aire frío. Pese a que las predicciones son todavía precavidas por la incertidumbre que existe en torno a la evolución de ciertos fenómenos atmosféricos, entre los cuales se halla un chorro polar, en el noroeste peninsular podrían notarse los efectos de una \\\"efímera DANA\\\". \\\" Lo que sí que está más claro es que es el embolsamiento de aire frío cruzará la vertical peninsular entre el fin de semana y las primeras horas del lunes\\\", advierten desde el citado medio. Ya el lunes, una borrasca formada en las islas británicas y otras bajas secundarias reemplazarán a esta primera masa de aire frío para perpetuar la inestabilidad en el tiempo. Así pues, los efectos de este ciclón nos acompañarán durante \\\"buena parte de la próxima semana\\\", con precipitaciones más abundantes en el tercio septentrional. \\\"Todo indica que la nieve volverá a caer en zonas altas de la cordillera [Pirineos]\\\", advierten. Asimismo, añaden que crecerán chubascos y tormentosos localmente intensos en zonas de montaña y en el noreste, con posibilidad de que lleguen a Baleares. Antes de que el frío se apodere de gran parte del país, todavía podemos disfrutar de varias jornadas de calor veraniego: la subida generalizada de temperaturas, favorecida por el anticiclón y la dorsal que atraviesan España estos días, ha comenzado este jueves se extenderá hasta el viernes. Ya el sábado, el noroeste peninsular será el primero en sufrir una caída en los termómetros, mientras que en el resto del país se mantendrán e incluso subirán en algunos puntos del noreste. Así pues, el calor que ha llevado a localidades como El Granado (Huelva) a rozar los 35 grados (34,5 °C el miércoles) estos días se extenderá al centro e incluso este peninsular y tocarán techo el viernes; aunque, con todo, el domingo será la fecha límite para que se produzcan \\\"descensos importantes\\\" de temperaturas por efecto de un incremento de la inestabilidad.",
