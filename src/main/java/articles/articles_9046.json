    "text": "Environmental concerns remain after massive fire at Camden recycling yard A massive industrial fire in Camden has left neighbors with environmental and health concerns.\nThe Brief It’s nearly two weeks after a massive fire broke out at the EMR Metal Yard on South Front Street. The industrial fire in Camden has left neighbors with environmental and health concerns. CAMDEN, N.J. - The City of Camden says it’s working with state and county officials along with EMR Metal Yard to \"investigate and evaluate\" the massive fire that broke out February 21st. It says when it’s done it will meet with impacted residents and tell them what they’ve learned.\nWhat we know:\nA community meeting scheduled for Wednesday evening with Camden residents and the metal recycler, that was the scene of a massive fire almost two weeks ago, has been postponed while city officials say they are evaluating the fire and will meet with residents in the future.\nMassive equipment clawed at piles of debris at the EMR Metal Recycling yard on South Front Street Wednesday. Nearly two weeks after a massive fire sent thick, black smoke into the air and drew fire crews from across the region neighbors remember the fear.\nEMR reports a lithium-ion battery improperly sent to its scrap recycling facility caused the blaze. EMR did not immediately return a call for comment Wednesday.\nRelated\narticle Massive junkyard fire under control and extinguished, officials say The thick, black smoke billowed up from the fire and was visible for miles beyond the site of the fire, while up close, huge flames were seen leaping out into the sky. The fire was extinguished by Saturday evening.\nWhat they're saying:\nCeleste Rodriquez of Camden remembers the evening of the blaze. She said, \"It was incredibly scary. I was getting off my job and someone noticed smoke. I thought it was a house fire but when I went outside and saw the great plume of smoke, it felt like a post-apocalyptic world.\"\nRodriquez lives a few blocks from EMR and works at a nearby school. She said she and her family hunkered down at home and rode out the fire.\nWhat's next:\nMeanwhile, in a public notice from the city of Camden, a meeting set for Wednesday evening with residents, the company and city officials has been postponed by EMR.\nFOX 29 was told EMR was to meet with county officials Wednesday to discuss changes to the site’s fire suppression system while residents want the big, metal recycler to just go away.\nRodriquez said, \"A lot of residents just want that company gone and we’re trying to work with the city and officials to inform them we are tired. We are sick of this.\"",

    "title": "FTC is sued by business groups over its ban on noncompete agreements, which may delay enforcement | Money | news8000.com",
    "text": "New York (CNN) — Less than 24 hours after the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule this week banning employers from using noncompete agreements in the United States, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable filed a lawsuit against the agency in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas. Another lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas by business tax services firm Ryan. And more may be filed in the coming weeks. “We think it’s likely additional lawsuits could be filed,” said employment lawyer Daniel Turinsky, a partner at DLA Piper. Even before the rule was issued, the US Chamber had promised to sue on grounds that, in its view, the agency exceeded its administrative authority by outlawing what it deems “unfair methods of competition.” The suit argues that without a clear legislative mandate from Congress, the FTC does not have the power to issue and enforce its blanket noncompete ban. “The FTC contends that by using regulation they can simply declare common business practices to be ‘unfair methods of competition’ and thus illegal. This is despite the fact that noncompete agreements have been around longer than the 110-year-old FTC and until now no one has suggested that they are illegal,” the US Chamber said in a release announcing the lawsuit. “If the FTC can regulate noncompete agreements, then they can decide to regulate or even ban any other business practice. All without a vote from Congress.” The Chamber and the Business Roundtable, along with a third plaintiff — the Longview Chamber of Commerce in Longview, Texas — are asking the court to issue a stay to stop the rule from going into effect, a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the FTC from enforcing the rule while the case is being litigated, “or both.” In response to the US Chamber’s lawsuit, FTC Chair Lina Khan expressed confidence the agency is on firm ground legally. Appearing on CNN’s “The Lead With Jake Tapper” after the new noncompete prohibition was announced, she said the agency has “clear legal authority” to issue such a ban. Long delays may be on tap before the rule takes effect The FTC rule isn’t set to go into effect until 120 days from the day it is published in the Federal Register. So likely not before September. But that effective date could be postponed if the federal courts in Texas — or any other courts where suits are filed — decide to grant a stay or preliminary injunction. That leaves employers and employees in limbo when it comes to existing noncompete agreements, almost all of which would become unenforceable if and when the rule takes effect. (The only exception here are existing noncompetes for senior executives — they will remain in force regardless.) In the near term, “I’m generally telling clients to take a wait-and-see approach with respect to the FTC rule while court challenges play out in the next few weeks,” Turinsky said. If the rule is put on ice until the cases are decided, and then appeals are filed, that could further delay the rule’s effective date by many more months if it isn’t ultimately struck down completely. “The rule is being challenged, and there is a fairly significant likelihood that the challenge could be upheld by lower courts,” said James Witz, a shareholder at Littler, an employer-side law firm, and co-chair of the firm’s Unfair Competition and Trade Secrets Practice Group. Translation: “It could take some time for the noncompetes to be invalidated,” Witz said. But employers still seeking to issue new noncompetes while the cases are litigated, may face resistance from some employees who are now aware of the FTC’s action, he noted.

I partenopei passano 3-0 in semifinale contro la Fiorentina, con una prova cinica e spietata davanti ai circa seimila tifosi dell’Al-Awwai Park (nonostante il dato ufficiale parli di quasi diecimila, comunque un deserto). Decisivi i gol del Cholito Simeone e la doppietta di Zerbin , che dopo la trasferta araba di unirà in prestito al Frosinone (e quindi non ci sarà contro il Cagliari).\nLunedì la finale di questa nuova Supercoppa Italiana, che vedrà gli uomini di Mazzarri sfidare la vincente tra Inter e Lazio . Si gioca stasera alle 20, sempre con la formula dei novanta minuti secchi: in caso di parità, infatti, non ci saranno i tempi supplementari ma si procederà subito coi calci di rigore.\nPer l’occasione Sarri recupera Immobile, che sarà al centro dell’attacco, supportato dai “soliti” Felipe Anderson e Zaccagni. Dall’altra, parte, tandem Thuram-Lautaro per Inzaghi, che va a caccia del suo quinto successo nella competizione: supererebbe Lippi e Capello, diventando l’allenatore più vincente nella storia della Supercoppa.\n(Unioneonline/L.Ne.)\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "title": "The role of ABIM-IKRAM-Umno-Amanah for the battle of the Malay mind and soul - Opinion",
    "text": "In Malaysia, the mind and soul of the Malays now solely belong to PAS and Bersatu. Anwar’s battle for the Malay mind and soul through his Madani Malaysia construct has a long way to go, if it is going anywhere at all. With due respect to a hard-working prime minister who has the mind and vision for a new or a renewed Malaysia, I suspect that the man is still in the mindset of the 1980s and 90s when the Islamic Reformist ruled the narratives for the Malays. I propose that 2024 will be the watermark for any shift in the Malay mind and soul. If nothing is done, and we hope only for a Madani Malaysia, I am afraid that we Malaysians will be in for an extremely long haul of conservatism and extremism. In this article, I wish to propose that the four Malay groups now weak in controlling the Malay and Islamic narrative, join forces to become an extremely potent force of reforming the national narrative. Umno is severely weakened after GE15. With the party joining the Unity Government, Umno is on its last leg of “make it or break it” in the politics of Malaysia. Forced to be a centrist party and no longer shouting right wing rhetoric, Umno does not know how to reinvent itself. Umno is in a survival mode, and only a new vision working with others can perhaps put the spring back in its steps. Since its birth and growth, Amanah was as irrelevant before as it is now. Without PH or DAP, this party will just tutup kedai. But this party has the largest number of seasoned politicians well versed in an Islam closest to the civilising or Madani construct that Anwar is proposing. This is because Amanah was once an Islamic Reformist entity under PAS, which is also supposed to be a centrist Islamist group but for the religious zealots that now control the helm. Unlike Umno, Amanah has no record of strength, and the party is best described as a parti tumpang sekaki. I hate myself for being crude and kurang ajar for my statement, but I am truly disappointed with Amanah, its members and leadership for not championing the narrative of a progressive Islam. ABIM and IKRAM, historically are the two entities that have ushered in a modern Islamic Reformist movement to change the Malays and to reinvent the race into a more matured and civilised race open to universal values of righteousness and a dynamic perspective of modern-day political issues of nation-building and global co-existence. However, after successfully building many schools for the new generation of Malay Muslims, these two entities slumped into complacency and irrelevance to the Malay minds. As an analogy, I view that all four groups are in an ICU of complete irrelevance with regards to winning the battle of the Malay mind and soul. What is the end game or winning scenario of a new Malay mind and a new Malay soul? The new Malay mind that I meant is one that is truly educated, well read, critical in thought, open in ideas of other systems, organisation and heritage, and able to visualise a better quality and dignity of life for human existence. What then is the Malay soul? The Malay soul is the one inspired by an Islam that encourages compassion, inclusiveness, tolerance, patience, decorum in criticising, and real respect for other faiths and cultures. In other words, everything that is in the Madani concept proposed by Anwar. Now, how should we get the Malays to change from an attitude of arrogance, exclusive supremacist, fear and incompetence into a Malay that is confident, educated, open-minded and scientifically well versed? Firstly, I thought the best way to change the Malays mindset and attitude would be the intelligentsia among the Malay academics. After 23 years of asking, begging and prodding the Malay intelligentsia, I have given up. The Malay professors and academics at all universities semua tak boleh pakai when it comes to public discourse on nation-building. They are experts in a tiny portion of knowledge, and they remain in their own cocoons of their small world of elitist ignorance. Secondly, I thought muftis should be at the forefront of creating a new and exciting Malay-Muslim narrative of nation-building and global coexistence. But again, I was disappointed when muftis are concerned only on petty issue and not about big ideas of nation-building, regenerating trust among the people, and championing the needy of all races, religions and sexual orientation. The muftis won’t help in reforming the Malay mind and they keep well within their boundaries of rituals, modesty for women, alcohol consumption and pilgrimages. They are incapable of taking the Malays and the Muslims into the future because most of the religious officials never left the past within their minds and spirit. I now call upon Umno, ABIM, IKRAM and Amanah to pool their strengths and resources. None can play the hero because all are now “extras”! The first act is to put up a working committee comprising of all members and have workshops on agreeing what kind of Melayu does Malaysia need going into the future — our future and the global one, too. There needs to be a new interpretation of how recent and past history shapes the new narrative and how this narrative now proposes policies to the benefit of all Malaysians. A series of Kongres Melayu Baru can be held to replace the Kongres Maruah Melayu that was too narrow-minded and self-serving only to one group and one ex-PM. The committee must also suggest plans for social media content to bombard the Malays with these new values and inclusive narrative. The Madani model can be part of the new Malay narrative, but it must not be seen solely coming from Anwar. The idea of the new Malay must have ownership by the four groups that would form the major push against the dangerous politics of PAS and Bersatu. Let PAS and Bersatu shout pendatang, this haram and that haram, or who is kafir and who is munafik. Let their shouts and ranting be drowned by the new narrative of a dynamic, confident and worldly Melayu rooted in the progressive idealism of Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad, not by Hadi Awang. I do not see this country moving anywhere positive and with any concrete narrative until these four Malay entities decide to change it. Even though this country belongs to all Malaysians, ultimately it is still the values, perspectives and narrative of the Malay that will carry the bigger weight.
