    "text": "Cachoeirinha segue submersa e orientação é não retornar para casa diante da previsão de mais chuva Rio Gravataí ainda está muito acima do nível normal; última medição apontou 6,22metros e provoca muitos bloqueios publicidade Cachoeirinha mantém cerca de 1,6 mil pessoas acolhidas em 25 abrigos montados pela prefeitura e estima que 5 mil pessoas tenham sido afetadas pela cheia do Rio Gravataí, que segue baixando de forma muito tímida. Há muitas outras pessoas acolhidas na casa de amigos e parentes, mas este dado a Prefeitura não sabe estimar. A última mediação do rio apontou que o nível estava em 6,22 metros, sendo que o nível normal é entre 2,30 e 2,33metros. Com a previsão de mais chuva para o final de semana, ao menos 200mm até domingo, o prefeito Cristian Wasem orienta que as pessoas permaneceram fora de casa, em abrigos ou casa de parentes. A estimativa da Defesa Civil não prevê que amplie o raio de 1,5 metros, mas as regiões já afetadas devem permanecer alagadas em um cenário de chuva intensa. Wasem publicou no início na semana um documento decretando situação de emergência. Na mesma situação, banhada pelo Rio Gravataí e com inúmeros pontos de alagamentos, a cidade de Alvorada decretou estado de calamidade pública e segue com aulas suspensas por tempo indeterminado. As famílias que residem nos bairros Americana, Nova Americana, Onze de Abril, Umbu e Tijuca são as mais afetadas tendo em vista o extravasamento do arroio Feijó. A Prefeitura estima que mais de 1 mil famílias estejam fora de casa. A coleta de donativos, cujas doações estão sendo repassadas para os desabrigados e desalojados, está concentrada no Ginásio Djalma Neves. Neste momento, a Administração solicita a doação de água potável, alimentos não perecíveis, marmotas, roupas de cama e produtos de higiene pessoal",

    "text": "La subdelegada del Gobierno de España en Cádiz, Blanca Flores, ha recibido a la alcaldesa de Jerez, María José García Pelayo, para analizar la candidatura del municipio gaditano, que aspira a ser Capital Europea de la Cultura en 2031. El reto de la Capital Europea es una designación por un año que en 2031 recaerá, tras la aprobación de la Comisión Europea, en una ciudad de España y en otra de Malta. Dentro de la estrategia que ha presentado Jerez, y que este pasado martes se dio a conocer en Diputación de Cádiz a 18 representantes de localidades de la provincia, está abordar el enfoque de la candidatura desde un punto de vista del territorio provincial, conectando no solo su historia, sus señas de identidad, y su patrimonio natural y monumental, sino también su rica y heterogénea tradición cultural. Blanca Flores ha recibido a la delegación jerezana con “actitud receptiva y colaborativa. Trasladaremos al Ministerio de Cultura las inquietudes que ha manifestado el equipo de Gobierno de Jerez”. García-Pelayo ha apostado por “sumar esfuerzos en torno a este reto compartido ya que está demostrado que este tipo de apuestas no solo refuerzan a la ciudad que defiende la candidatura, sino que tienen impacto y repercusión social, cultural y económica en todo su entorno”. Al mismo tiempo, ha recordado que ya se ha presentado al que será el futuro Consejo Director del proyecto Jerez 2031, participado por Ayuntamiento de Jerez, Diputación de Cádiz, Cámaras de Comercio y Universidad de Cádiz, y que el próximo jueves 18 de julio se hará la puesta de largo, en los Museos de La Atalaya de Jerez, del desafío de Jerez 2031, Capital Europea de la Cultura. En la reunión también han estado presentes Agustín Muñoz, primer teniente de alcaldesa; Francisco Zurita, delegado de Cultura y Eva Mª Antona, directora de Planes Especiales del Ayuntamiento de Jerez. Junto a Jerez de la Frontera estarán en liza para optar a esta capitalidad cultural las ciudades de Burgos, Cáceres, Granada, Las Palmas, Toledo y Oviedo. En 2031 serán España y Malta los países europeos que aportarán las dos localidades distinguidas. El Gobierno de España publicará –entre el último trimestre de 2024 y el segundo trimestre de 2025- la convocatoria de propuestas; desde dicho anuncio las ciudades interesadas disponen de diez meses para remitir el dossier de defensa de la candidatura; esos documentos se someten a una preselección por parte de un panel de expertos que filtrará una selección de finalistas y emitirá recomendaciones para revisar la solicitud; las candidaturas tienen por tanto la opción de enmendar sus propuestas antes de la designación formal, por parte de la Comisión Europea, que se resolverá en 2027, cuatro años antes de la celebración.",

    "title": "George Mason researcher gets CAREER award for quantum leaps in computing, with the help of AI | College of Engineering and Computing",
    "text": "Weiwen Jiang, an assistant professor in the George Mason University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is an expert in quantum computing, having recently received nearly $1 million in National Science Foundation (NSF) funding to study “noise” that impacts quantum computing and to work on training the next generation of quantum experts.\nJiang’s research is all about pushing the mysterious world of quantum computing into the mainstream. “We are at the quantum utility era, which means we are going to have computational applications that can be implemented with and utilize the power of quantum computing,” he said. But Jiang knows that researchers need a boost in understanding the full quantum capability.\nIn January he received an NSF CAREER award for $641,778 for his work on quantum-centric computing cyberinfrastructure (QuCI). A combination of quantum computers, classical computers, and AI accelerators, QuCI is set to revolutionize\nsoftware applications handling everything from geophysics, chemistry, finance, and life sciences, because it can outperform classical computing with its speed, accuracy, and the ability to handle large, data-heavy problems. For example, the success of processing geoscience data on quantum computers can enable real-time decision-making on natural hazards, which leads to cost savings, reduced environmental impacts, and improved safety.\nJiang’s project includes three thrusts. One is using what’s called an AI-powered quantum performance predictor, which leads to an innovative and efficient ability to allocate computing resources in the moment. Jiang said, “When a batch of jobs comes into the system, we need to allocate the jobs into different quantum nodes and we want to distribute the jobs effectively.”\nAnother focus is bridging a knowledge gap between experts who want to run software applications but are not experts in quantum. “In order to fill this gap we do not want the expert to learn quantum computing from scratch,” he said. “We’ll find opportunities to fine-tune the configuration for quantum control optimization,” helping a non-expert user harness the power of quantum computing by combining classical central-processing unit computing with quantum. Current QuCIs require complicated decision-making to ensure correct computing results are obtained, but this can fall into the hands of users who lack quantum knowledge. Jiang’s project automates QuCI deployment, making decisions and optimizations at different stages without human interference.\nA third element is to develop what’s known as fault-tolerant quantum computing, which means allowing quantum computers to operate even when encountering errors. Jiang said, “Before we submit the job, we will add fault-tolerant protocols to ensure the functional correctness and boost performance.”\nThe NSF CAREER award is reserved for the nation’s most talented up-and-coming researchers. From the NSF website: “The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program offers NSF’s most prestigious award in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization.”\nBeyond the scientific impact, the project builds an easy-to-understand quantum education program, which includes building a visualization platform to make quantum computations visible. This is significantly important for beginners who easily suffer from the counterintuitive concepts of quantum computing. In addition, Jiang will create workshops, tutorials, and competitions for different research communities, contribute to a George Mason-led quantum immersion program for K-12 students; and redesign a quantum curriculum at George Mason with outcomes from this project.",

    "title": "Win for PTI: SC orders reserved seats to be given to SIC",
    "text": "[Pakistan](/pakistan) [Win for PTI as SC declares party eligible for reserved seats](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40312389/win-for-pti-as-sc-declares-party-eligible-for-reserved-seats) - 'PTI was and is a political party', court rules The Supreme Court (SC) declared on Friday former prime minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities. The 13-member SC bench annulled the [Peshawar High Court’s](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40293756) previous order as unconstitutional. The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) had demanded that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ruling coalition be reallocated to the PTI-backed party. The ruling coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament. Imran’s party strength stood at 84 before the decision and is now expected to rise to over 100. The SIC is the new home to PTI-backed independent candidates. The PTI candidates were forced to contest elections as independents after the SC upheld the ECP’s decision, deeming its intra-party polls “unconstitutional” and [revoked its claim on the iconic electoral symbol](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40280170/ecp-decides-against-letting-pti-retain-bat-symbol). In a bid to grab the [seats reserved for women and minorities](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40289709), PTI declared that the party-backed winning candidates in the February 8 elections would join the minority SIC in the National Assembly as well as in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. In Pakistan, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats - 60 for women, and 10 for non-Muslims - in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly’s total strength of 336 seats. The ruling coalition has 224 seats in the National Assembly, which gives it a two-thirds majority. As many as 21 of the 25 SIC reserved seats were allotted to the ruling coalition. [PTI-backed candidates to join Sunni Ittehad Council](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40289709) The Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) got 16 of the SIC reserved seats and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) got five of those seats. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) was given four. If these seats are reallocated, the ruling coalition’s strength would be reduced to 203 seats. In March, a five-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, [had rejected the SIC’s petition](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40291914/ecp-decides-against-allocating-reserved-seats-to-sunni-ittehad-council) seeking the allocation of reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies. The ECP announced the verdict with a 4-1 majority, saying the SIC was not entitled to reserved seats. Today, the decision, backed by eight judges, was announced by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah. “The withdrawal of election symbol cannot disqualify a political party from elections. The PTI was and is a political party,” the court said. The judgment further said that the withdrawal of an election symbol cannot disqualify a political party from participating in the elections. A full court, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Ayesha Malik, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, on July 09, upon the completion of arguments of the SIC and PTI lawyers against the PHC’s verdict on reserved seats of women and non-Muslims [had reserved the judgment](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40312133/sc-reserves-verdict-on-reserved-seats-allocation-case). The full court on Wednesday and Thursday held meetings and deliberated upon the decision, and the verdict was [put off till Friday](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40312551/reserved-seats-case-scs-verdict-on-sic-plea-put-off-till-today). Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, the counsels of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Sikandar Bashir Mohmand, and Makhdoom Ali Khan, who represented affected candidates, elected on reserved seats, argued that the SIC was no longer entitled to the reserved seats as it had neither contested general elections nor won any seats. PTI reacts Following the SC verdict, PTI’s official X account demanded the immediate resignation of Chief Election Commissioner Sikander Sultan Raja for violating the Constitution of Pakistan. Party spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Soon, very soon.” In a post on X, PTI said nomination papers of the party members were rejected, the election symbol was taken, and the reserved seats were allocated to other parties. “The ECP must be dissolved and should be held accountable for these unconstitutional measures against PTI,” the post read. Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also celebrated the verdict. “Justice served, but all the minority opinions incl [sic] the one CJP read out sounded confused at best unlike the clarity of the majority 8 mbr [sic] order!” she wrote on X. Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said the apex court’s judgment poses no challenge to the government. Addressing a news conference in Islamabad after the development, he said the ruling coalition has a clear majority both in the National and Punjab Assemblies. The law minister said PTI was neither a party in the case nor had sought relief. He said it was the SIC which had moved the court for the reserved seats. JUI-F welcomes SC decision The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) has welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to declare PTI eligible for reserved seats and announced that it would not go into review petition. Addressing a press conference on Friday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also expressed solidarity with PTI over their victory, saying aggrieved parties had the right to go into review.",
