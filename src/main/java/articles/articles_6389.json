    "text": "KATHMANDU: In the wake of devastation caused by the flashflood in Rasuwa district, bordering the northern neighbour, Minister for Energy, Water Resource and Irrigation, Dipak Khadka, has insisted on establishing an effective coordination with Chinese government to minimize damages from disasters.\n“As many rivers flow from northern neighbour China to Nepali territory, coordination and collaboration with China is essential to minimize the impact of river floods and landslides in Nepal,” Khadka said during a ministry level discussion on Thursday. The discussion dwelt on preparedness and management of monsoon related disaster.\nMinister Khadka reminded, “There was no rainfall neither the breach of lake. But why was there a flash flood in the Bhotekoshi in Rasuwa district? If the siren was\ninstalled by the Weather Forecasting Division, information on the disaster could be received on time so as to reduce damages,” he stressed. The Minister argued although proper system for data and information was repeatedly raised in the ministry, it was not put into practice, creating such problems.\nAccording to Nepal government has given priority to the conservation of glacial lake. If the glacial lakes in China burst, it poses serious threats to Nepal. So, coordination with Chinese side is necessary, he underlined.\nThe Minister, however, said, “The government is facing resources crunch. We need early warning system in place. If such facility is ensured in the projects like hydropower to canals, it would help minimize damages.”\nHe directed the subordinates and concerned officials to move ahead by forming a committee to make smooth the preparedness.\nSimilarly, he informed that he would hold a discussion with Finance Ministry to allow discount on import of materials used for reconstruction of infrastructures damaged by the landslides and floods. He urged the employees to work in a way to ensures results that satisfies service seekers.\nMinistry Secretary Sarita Dawadi said time has come to add stations in mountainous and hilly regions for early warning system. The activities relating to disaster in the ministry need an integrated approach to address the problems, she reminded.\nOn the occasion, Executive Director at NEA, Hitendra Dev Shakya, said the floods in Bhotekoshi caused a huge damage in hydropower- Rasuwagadhi, Chilime, Trishuli-III (B).\nOther speakers in the discussion underlined the need of reinforcing coordination at all three tiers of government.",

    "text": "Estremecedora caída de un esquiador, en la Copa del Mundo: fue retirado en helicóptero Momentos de máxima tensión se vivieron, este jueves, en Italia, luego de que Marco Schwarz, esquiador favorito al título, sufriera un fuerte accidente en competencia. Marco Schwarz, promesa austríaca del esquí alpino que lideraba la clasificación de la general de la Copa del Mundo, no podrá volver a competir en la actual temporada debido a las serias heridas que sufrió este jueves durante el descenso de Bormio (Italia). Así lo informó la Federación Austríaca de Esquí (ÖSV) al comunicar el diagnóstico que le hicieron los médicos a Schwarz en un hospital de Innsbruck, capital del Tirol. En una estrepitosa caída en Bormio, el esquiador de 28 años \"sufrió una [rotura del ligamento cruzado, una rotura del menisco interno y daños en el cartílago de su rodilla derecha](https://sports.caracoltv.com/deportes) El atleta será operado el viernes, en la clínica privada de Hochrum por el especialista Christian Fink, el mismo que hace unos días operó al futbolista austríaco David Alaba, defensa del Real Madrid, de su lesión de ligamento cruzado.

Alles Gute für Marco Schwarz!— storymakers (@mz_storymakers) [#Bormio] [#Downhill] [#fisalpine] [@Ski_Austria_] [pic.twitter.com/4SLv6EG1RD] [December 28, 2023] Publicidad \"Como nos temíamos, el diagnóstico de Marco es desgraciadamente muy grave. La temporada ha terminado, por supuesto, lo que supone una amarga pérdida para todo el equipo\", declaró el jefe del esquí alpino, Herbert Mandl, citado por la agencia local APA. Tras caer durante el descenso en Bormio, Schwarz, que salía en la decimoséptima posición, se salió de la pista y terminó contra las vallas protectoras, teniendo que ser, primero, atendido, bloqueada su pierna derecha y, tras unos minutos, ser trasladado en un helicóptero a Innsbruck. ⛷️💥🇦🇹 La forta caiguda de Marco Schwarz al descens de Bormio— laneualdia (@laneualdia) [#infoneu] [#infonieve] [#nieve] [#esquí] [#snowboard] [#ski] [#snow] [#neu] [https://t.co/27K9gVmEAx] [pic.twitter.com/OfVjqUkDCl] [December 28, 2023] Ello motivó que la prueba fuera interrumpida durante una veintena de minutos. Publicidad Schwarz, después de quedar primero en el eslalon de Madonna di Campiglio, fue el único esquiador que había logrado clasificarse entre los 10 primeros en todas las disciplinas. Acudió a Bormio como cabeza de la general de la Copa del Mundo y aspiraba a consolidarse este invierno como uno de los mejores en todas las categorías.
