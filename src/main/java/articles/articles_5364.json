    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Infowars founder Alex Jones speaks to the media after appearing at his Sandy Hook defamation trial at Connecticut Superior Court in Waterbury, Connecticut, U.S., October 4, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By Dietrich Knauth NEW YORK (Reuters) - Families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims want to seize Alex Jones&#039; social media accounts in his bankruptcy, saying that the conspiracy theorist&#039;s frequent posts to fans are a key part of the Infowars business being liquidated to pay Jones&#039; debts. Jones, who filed for bankruptcy protection 17 months ago, has given up on trying to reach a settlement that would reduce the $1.5 billion that he owes to the relatives of 20 students and six staff members killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. FILE PHOTO: Francine and David Wheeler, whose son Ben was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting, listen as their attorneys address the media after the jury awarded the victims&#039; families $965 million in damages in a second defamation trial against Alex Jones over Sandy Hook claims in Waterbury, Connecticut, U.S., October 12, 2022. REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlin/File Photo Jones and the Sandy Hook families now agree that Jones&#039; assets should be liquidated in bankruptcy. But the families on Wednesday asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Houston, Texas, to additionally take control of Jones&#039; X.com account and prevent Jones from using it to promote new business ventures. The Sandy Hook families asked the judge to make clear that the Jones&#039; &quot;@RealAlexJones&quot; account on X.com, formerly known as Twitter, will be among the assets turned over to a court-appointed trustee in charge of liquidating Jones&#039; assets. Jones&#039; X account, which has 2.3 million followers, is &quot;no different than a customer list of any other liquidating business,&quot; the Sandy Hook families argued. FILE PHOTO: A person visits the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial on the 10th anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, U.S., December 14, 2022. REUTERS/David &#039;Dee&#039; Delgado/File Photo They argued that Jones has used the social media account to push down the value of Infowars by diverting sales from that site to his father&#039;s DrJonesNaturals.com, which sells health supplements and other products. Jones was banned from the platform for nearly five years, but his account was reinstated in December after a user poll conducted by X.com owner Elon Musk. A U.S. bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the families&#039; demand at a Friday court hearing in Houston. The judge is expected to convert Alex Jones&#039; bankruptcy case from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which offers more control to a bankrupt debtor, to a Chapter 7 liquidation, which would allow a court-appointed trustee to take and sell Jones&#039; assets. Jones claimed for years that the Sandy Hook killings were staged with actors as part of a government plot to seize Americans&#039; guns. Jones has since acknowledged that the shooting occurred. The judge overseeing Jones&#039; bankruptcy has ruled that most of the debt will survive after a liquidation, because it resulted from &quot;willful and malicious&quot; conduct. Jones has estimated that he has less than $12 million in assets, meaning that he will carry an enormous legal debt even after Infowars and his other assets are sold. The Sandy Hook families intend to continue collection actions against Jones&#039; future income, and pursue additional payments from Jones&#039; wife, father, employees and other associates to whom Jones&#039; allegedly diverted assets. A Chapter 7 liquidation will enable the Sandy Hook families to enforce their judgments &quot;now and into the future while also depriving Jones of the ability to inflict mass harm as he has done for some 25 years,&quot; said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families. Jones has said on a June 7 broadcast of The Alex Jones show that Infowars is &quot;overrun&quot; and &quot;will be completely worthless&quot; without him. He encouraged listeners to buy products from DrJonesNaturals to support his &quot;future&quot; and make sure he can continue to broadcast after the shutdown of Infowars. &quot;I&#039;ve already sold everything but my house,&quot; Jones said on June 7. &quot;I&#039;m down to my last moves on this.&quot; (Reporting by Dietrich Knauth; Editing by Josie Kao)",

    "text": "Consider it a wakeup call about how sleep can negatively impact one’s appearance.\nJuice Beauty is rolling out an eye cream that is designed to help revive one’s skin and combat wrinkles that come from catching some Zs.\nThe packaging has massaging applicator that stimulates eye circulation. New SleepWrinkle Retinol Overnight Eye Cream, part of the brand’s Stem Cellular franchise, contains a proprietary 2.5% bio retinol and retinol combination formulated specifically for the area of around the eyes. In that area, skin is much thinner than the skin of the rest of the face and as such can be impacted by how one sleeps, according to Juice Beauty Founder Karen Behnke.\nBy our 30th birthday, we’ve slept more than 10,000 times—and that can lead to sleep wrinkles. What’s more, as we age, the wrinkles from sleep can start to last longer throughout the day.\n“Think about how we all scrunch our faces all night when you sleep on your side or your stomach, a lot of wrinkled skin all night long,” said Behnke.\nBut don’t ger her wrong. “Beauty sleep is still imperative,” she told Happi, “but with the average head weighing 11 pounds and the skin around the eyes 10 times thinner than the skin on the rest of the face, sleep wrinkles are real and inevitable.”\nAccording to San Francisco plastic surgeon Dr. Carolyn Chang, wrinkles are not caused by sleep per se, but can be developed as a result of sleep positions which cause pressure and friction.\n“Other wrinkles are most likely a result of aging and sun damage and the resulting loss of elasticity. The aging process decreases collagen content and moisture content, producing thinner skin and visible wrinkling. The eye area is particularly susceptible to wrinkling because it is the most thin and delicate skin on the face,” added Dr. Chang. who specializes in cosmetic surgery with a natural aesthetic and is also Juice Beauty’s scientific medical advisor.\nSleepWrinkle Retinol Overnight Eye Cream is designed to work while one sleeps.\nKey Ingredients The formulation features bio-retinol from lentisk, a dioecious evergreen shrub; vitamin A (retinol); peptides; CoQ10 (ubiquinone); hyaluronic acid; vitamin B5; and jojoba, coconut and shea butters.\nIn addition, evening primrose encapsulation is said to preserve and maintain the potency of the retinol and minimize irritation. Juice Beauty said its technology eliminates the need for conventional chemical processing and other encapsulation ingredients that it deems less desirable to some consumers.\nA New Wrinkle in Wrinkles While the eyes are the target for this launch, other areas of the body are susceptible to the same sleep-related issues.\n“All areas of the face can be impacted by sleep positions. Sustained pressure and friction of the face on a pillow that is on the hard side can cause premature wrinkling, but the same pressure during sleep will also cause skin on décolleté to wrinkle,” noted Dr. Chang.\nAnything that can reduce contact of the skin with surfaces that cause pressure or friction will minimize the impact can help, she said.\n“The best way to prevent facial wrinkles during sleep is to sleep on your back. Other considerations are to sleep on a soft and more full pillow, and use pillowcases that minimize friction which allows your face to rest on a smoother, slicker surface, such as those made of silk or satin.”\nAlong with adjustments to sleep behavior, nightly use of the new skincare formulation from Juice Beauty will provide beneficial results, she insists.\nKaren Behnke\n“The SleepWrinkle cream was formulated with Bio-Retinol + Retinol, evening primrose, peptides and hyaluronic acid which I recommend to my patients post-surgery to heal and calm skin,” said Dr. Chang.\nJuice Beauty SleepWrinkle Retinol Overnight Eye Cream packaging features a massaging applicator that stimulates eye circulation as well.\nAdditional Reading Juice Beauty Unveils New Serum (2020)\nClean Beauty Entrepreneurs Honored by Cosmetic Executive Women Related Searches Actives Skin Care",

    "text": "WALKER COUNTY, Ga. — Plans to build a shooting range in Walker County just across the street from a Girl Scout camp are raising concerns for community members. But as of Thursday, those plans have been withdrawn, after developers pushing the plan noticed a map error. The proposal, put forth by McLemore Club LLC, was initially set to be discussed at a commission meeting Thursday night, but was pulled back prior to the meeting. The proposed site is located in the city of Menlo, right off Highway 157, directly across from Girl Scouts Camp Adahi. We have heard from several viewers who oppose the firing range. “I'm worried about our property values. I'm worried about my children.” JL Compton and his family live just 2,000 feet from the proposed shooting range site. “If you're walking a dog, if we have birthday parties, get togethers, how is all that noise gonna impact our home?\" Compton says. At the planning commission meeting last week, JL says at least 30 residents showed up to voice their concerns. \"It was unanimously shut down and denied through the board of planning and zoning.” According to a Walker County spokesperson, Macklemore withdrew the proposed plan from the agenda for Thursday. But a spokesperson for Scenic Land Company told us they pulled the plan because of an error in this map: Steve Bridges also lives close to the proposed site, and he says he doesn't want the sound of gunshots ringing through the valley his property overlooks. \"I'm not a opposed to guns. That's not the issue at all. We hear gunshots periodically with hunters, but it's not six days a week.\" Scenic Land Company tells usthey are \"taking into account the community's comments\" and they \"anticipate the opportunity for further discussion and consideration of the sporting club will come at a later date.\"",

    "text": "More than 75% of the Earth's surface has become more arid in the last 30 years\nBetween 1990 and 2020, 4.3 million square kilometers of wetlands were transformed into drylands, according to a report by the United Nations (UN).\nDespite an increase in water-related disasters such as floods and storms in several regions of the world, UN scientists have warned that more than 75% of the land has become permanently drier in recent decades .\nThe report, \"The Global Threat from Drylands: Regional and Global Aridity Trends and Future Projections\" , was launched at the 16th Conference of the nearly 200 Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (COP16), the largest UN land conference to date and the first UNCCD COP held in the Middle East, a region deeply affected by the impacts of aridity.\nOne third of Earth's surface is drier, says UN\nAccording to the landmark report by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), around 77.6 percent of the planet's land has become drier over the past three decades compared to the previous 30-year period.\nOver the same period, arid areas have increased by about 4.3 million km², an area almost a third larger than India, the world's seventh largest country, and now cover 40.6% of all land, excluding Antarctica.\nOver the past few decades, approximately 7.6% of the planet’s land – an area larger than Canada – has been transformed into more arid regions (i.e., from non-arid to arid land, or from less dry classes to drier arid classes). Most of these areas have changed from humid to arid regions, with serious consequences for agriculture, ecosystems and local populations.\nThe research warns that if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, another 3% of wetlands could become arid by the end of this century . Unlike droughts, defined by temporary periods of low rainfall, aridity represents a permanent transformation. However, when an area's climate becomes drier, the ability to return to previous conditions is lost .\nAreas that were not drylands in 1961–1990, but became drylands in 1991–2020, are present in all macroregions except Antarctica. Drylands are areas where the amount of rainfall is less than 65% of what can potentially be evaporated, and encompass all lands with hyperarid, arid, semiarid and dry subhumid climates. Non-drylands, with rainfall greater than 65% of potential evaporation, are considered humid.\nRegions of the world most affected by increasing aridity\nForced migration is one of the most obvious consequences of aridity. When land becomes unsuitable for living, families and entire communities, facing water scarcity and agricultural collapse, are often forced to leave their homes , generating social and political challenges in different parts of the world.\nIn Brazil, for example, periodic droughts and desertification between 1960 and 1980 were blamed for the emigration of more than 3 million people.\nParts of the western United States and Brazil’s cerrado and caatinga biomes are experiencing significant drought trends , with water shortages and wildfires becoming perennial risks. The Mediterranean and southern Europe , once considered agricultural breadbaskets, face a grim future as semi-arid conditions expand. In Central Africa and parts of Asia , biologically diverse areas are suffering from ecosystem degradation and desertification , putting countless species at risk.\nSources and references of the news\n- Vicente-Serrano, S.

    "text": "AMCD Condemns Jihad Targeting of Christians Worldwide WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, December 29, 2023 / [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- In the aftermath of the horrific attack by Islamic terrorists on Israeli civilians, jihadists slaughtered at least 160 Christians in Nigeria and wounded a further 300. Videos emerged of crying toddlers clinging to their mothers’ dead bodies, whole families, gunned down while trying to flee, lay in heaps on the ground over Christmas weekend. Church pastors and their entire families were murdered, and hundreds of houses were destroyed in the massacres in some 20 villages in Barkin Ladi, Bokkos and Mangu counties extending from Christmas eve into Christmas day. The traditional Christmas celebration was closed down entirely in Bethlehem; the Medieval Cologne Cathedral, which miraculously survived the allied bombing during WWII, was threatened by jihadist terror (luckily thwarted); Christmas markets all across Europe were subject to radically increased security and Christmas tree lightings were disrupted by deluded, pro-terrorist, anti-Israeli protests all across America, Australia, Great Britain and Europe. From South Lebanon, Hezbollah targeted a Greek Orthodox church near the Israeli border with anti-tank missiles, wounding nine Israeli soldiers who were giving medical aid to a civilian. Hezbollah continues to fire rockets into Israel civilian areas – 100 in a single day. “It is clear that violence against Jews and Christians is exploding,” said AMCD co-chair Tom Harb. “The world has been shocked at the precipitous rise of antisemitism, but anti-Christianity is rising just behind it. The desecration of churches has become an epidemic.” “It breaks my heart to see anti-Christian sentiment spreading in the United States,” added AMCD co-chair John Hajjar. “We Christians with origins in the Middle East are only too aware of how persecution begins. Christians are still the most persecuted group in the world today and jihadists are driving that persecution just as they are fueling the growth of murderous antisemitism world-wide.” The [American Mideast Coalition for Democracy](http://www.americanmideast.com/) condemns all antisemitic and anti-Christian acts and calls on all religious leaders of good faith to stand together against the alarming evil.
