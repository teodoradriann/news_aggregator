    "text": "Mbour, 27 fév (APS) – Djibril Ndoye, directeur de l’innovation chez ”Pegasystem Inc” et consultant en transformation digitale, Djibril Ndoye a invité, jeudi, le gouvernement à miser sur la formation des jeunes aux nouveaux outils technologiques pour assurer la souveraineté numérique du pays.\n‘’Il faut que le gouvernement investisse davantage sur la formation de ressources locales qui vont maîtriser ces technologies. (…) pour assurer une souveraineté numérique, on doit avoir une logique de transition qui va développer des compétences locales à long terme pour être moins dépendant de l’expertise externe’’, a préconisé M. Ndoye, dans un entretien avec l’APS.\nIl recommande de ‘’promouvoir l’enseignement du numérique au niveau des universités et des écoles de formation pour avoir plus de gens qui maîtrisent ces outils afin d’aider justement l’État à atteindre cette souveraineté numérique’’.\nLe consultant en transformation digitale soutient que ‘’le Sénégal n’a pas assez d’experts en numérique’’.\nCitant des études, il déclare qu’il faudra, d’ici à 2030, ‘’230 millions de ressources formées au numérique pour pouvoir atteindre les objectifs de croissance en Afrique subsaharienne’’.\nSelon lui, ‘’parmi les millions de Sénégalais et étudiants, il faut qu’il y ait certains qui émergent et maîtrisent ces technologies-là’’.\nLe Sénégal a procédé, lundi, au lancement de sa nouvelle stratégie numérique dénommée ‘’New deal technologique’’ dont les nouvelles autorités veulent faire une source d’une ”croissance durable” et ”le moteur d’une administration performante au service des citoyens et des entreprises’’.\n‘’J’invite les autorités à mettre en place une stratégie locale pour l’intelligence artificielle adossée à la nouvelle stratégie numérique +New deal technologique+’’, a dit Djibril Ndoye.\nIl assure que ‘’l’intelligence artificielle va garantir l’accès aux nouvelles technologies à beaucoup de gens qui ne parlent pas le français, ni l’anglais et encore moins l’espagnol’’.\n‘’Aujourd’hui, les systèmes d’intelligence artificielle sont de plus en plus performants et les analystes estiment d’ici 2030, qu’on aura entre 15 et 40 % de gains de productivité dans l’économie mondiale. Cela veut dire que l’intelligence artificielle va nécessairement améliorer la productivité de l’économie’’, a estimé M. Ndoye.\nDOB/ASG/ADL",

    "text": "This article was originally [published ](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/taiwan-president-comment-china-08212024034630.html)by Radio Free Asia and is reprinted with permission. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te on Wednesday urged the world’s democratic countries to come together and act to prevent China from expanding authoritarianism and changing the rules-based international order. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that should be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. The democratic island has been self-governing since it effectively separated from mainland China in 1949 after the Chinese civil war. Speaking at the annual Ketagalan Forum on Indo-Pacific security in Taipei, Lai cautioned that Taiwan was not Beijing’s “only target”. “China has even weaponized trade. Using various pressures and threats, it’s politically manipulating not just Taiwan, but also Japan, Korea, Australia, Lithuania, Canada, and other countries,” said Lai. “China intends to change the rules-based international order. That is why democratic countries must come together and take concrete action. Only by working together can we inhibit the expansion of authoritarianism,” he added, stressing that China’s “growing authoritarianism” would not stop with Taiwan. Lai is a member of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, which Beijing accuses of harboring separatist aspirations. He came to power after winning a January election despite Beijing’s fierce opposition to his bid. He ran on a platform of promoting peace in the Taiwan Strait while not compromising on claims of Taiwanese sovereignty. China has dialed up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the island since former president Tsai Ing-wen’s administration came to power in 2016, as DPP member Tsai also refused to acknowledge that Taiwan and the mainland belonged to “One China.” There have been near-daily sightings of Chinese warships around the democratic island as well as fighter jets and drones in the skies around it. But Lai said China’s “military expansionism” was taking place elsewhere, pointing to its joint exercises with Russia in the South China Sea, among other places. “Such actions are intended to intimidate China’s neighbors and undermine regional peace and stability,” Lai said. “Taiwan will not be intimidated. We will take responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.” The annual Ketagalan Forum is aimed at enhancing cooperation and dialogue among like-minded parties so as to maintain and advance peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. Former and current senior officials from 11 countries, including former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley attended the gathering, the first of its kind since the Lai administration took office.",

    "text": "[Walmart](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/walmart) has decided to get rid of self-checkout machines in two locations due to a rise in crime at those lanes not manned by staffed personnel. Two stores — one in Cleveland, Ohio, and another at Shrewsbury, Missouri — said they would be replacing the self-checkout kiosks with staff to “give our associates the chance to provide more personalized and efficient service,” the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/consumer/article-13341161/walmart-self-checkout-removal.html) reported. “We’ve decided to remove self-checkout lanes and replace them with staffed lanes at select locations,” a spokesperson for Walmart said. “The decision was based on several factors, including feedback from associates and customers, shopping patterns and business needs in the area,” the person added. The large retailer would not say if the two stores would be the only locations where the self-checkout machines would be removed, only that it did not “currently” have any announcements. Walmart begins removing self-checkout machines [https://t.co/38r6Eut90H] — VOZ (@Voz_US) [April 22, 2024] Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said, “Most of the rollback of self-checkouts is due to retailer concerns over theft.” “Theft rates at self-checkouts are reasonably high both because of deliberate actions and accidental mistakes,” he added. “Forcing more customers to used manned checkouts resolves a lot of these issues and saves retailers money.” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) It also turns out that the unmanned kiosks aren’t super popular with shoppers. A recent study from Drexel University in Pennsylvania found that the idea of self-checkout actually left shoppers irritated because they were left to having to do it all themselves, the outlet noted. Walmart isn’t the only retailer making that decision. [Dollar General](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/consumer/article-13210331/self-checkout-dollar-general-target-walmart.html) has opted to take the lanes away altogether from 300 of its stores due to high levels of shoplifting or mis-scanned items, the outlet noted. “We believe these actions have the potential to have a material and positive impact on shrink,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said. Target also revealed that it was limiting self-checkout kiosk customers to 10 items to improve shoppers’ experience. The decision follows Walmart’s recent announcement about the closure of four stores in Chicago, Illinois, due to poor performance at the locations, a move that also occurs as the city sees worsening crime rates. The decision to shutter the four locations comes one month after Walmart closed the firm’s remaining two stores in Portland, Oregon. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in an interview with CNBC last year that the company has been impacted by an uptick in shoplifting and warned that “stores will close” if the phenomenon is not resolved by city officials.

    "text": "por Copa Argentina Ni bien sonó el pitazo final por parte de Darío Herrera estalló una feroz batalla campal en el Ciudad de Lanús entre los planteles del Lobo y el Guapo. El final caliente entre Gimnasia (LP) y Barracas Central Gimnasia derrotó a Barracas Central y accedió a los cuartos de final de la Copa Argentina pero todas las miradas no se las llevó la despedida de Benjamín Domínguez con gol sino la tremenda batalla campal entre los dos planteles tras el pitazo final por parte de Darío Herrera. Con el final del encuentro inició una pelea entre Yonathan Cabral y Jhonatan Candia, que se trenzaron a golpes de puños mientras sus compañeros en vez de intentar separarles buscaban a otro adversario con quien pelear. El punto más caliente cuando aparece en escena un colaborador del Lobo, que tras golpear por la espalda a Candia procese a recibir una serie de patadas voladoras y puñetazos de parte de suplentes del Guapo mientras buscaba salir de la escena. La situación tardó varios minutos en calmarse, con parte de la comitiva de Gimnasia retirando por la fuerza a un enfurecido Cabral que minutos más tarde afirmó que su bronca surgió de un golpe por la espalda de Candia a Leonardo Morales. El informe del árbitro dio a conocer que, inicialmente, vieron fueron expulsados Cabral, Candia y Gustavo Canto, aunque se espera que más jugadores sean incorporados más tarde con el análisis más minucioso de las imágenes.
