    "text": "Best James Brown Songs: 20 Funk And Soul Masterpieces\nThis introduction to The Godfather of Soul contains some of the most important music of the 20th century.\nIf one were to name\nJames Brown as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century and beyond, there are few reasonable people who would argue. Born in 1933 in Barnwell, South Carolina, and raised in Augusta, Georgia, Brown grew up singing in gospel quartets and performing throughout the South. When he joined The Famous Flames, a powerful rhythm and blues ensemble fronted by his friend Bobby Byrd, Brown’s journey to stardom would begin.\nAn electric performer and tireless innovator, Brown’s catalog is one of the most diverse in the history of recorded music. From his emotive ballads in the 1950s, the fiery R&B sides of the 60s, the deeply funky and socially conscious workouts of the 70s, or his pop-soul hits of the 1980s, James Brown didn’t just weather the stylistic changes that shaped popular music. Most of the time, he was a major initiator of those changes.\nListen to the best James Brown songs on\nApple Music or Spotify.\nWhen the cultural revolution of hip-hop exploded onto mainstream consciousness in the 80s, sampling arose as a new and radical musical innovation. Hungry for hypnotic grooves, pounding drum breaks, dynamic vocals, and horn riffs, hip-hop producers and DJs naturally gravitated to the Godfather of Soul. Since then, countless DJs and producers have taken bits of James Brown’s best songs to use in their own new creations, thus allowing Brown’s musical DNA to continue to spread far and wide.\nWith dozens of studio albums, live albums, and compilations as well as the numerous hits that Brown produced for associated acts like\nLyn Collins, The J.B.s, Vicki Anderson, Bobby Byrd, and others, there is no list that could fully encompass James Brown’s prodigious musical output. That being said, these 20 best songs are a great introduction to his incredible career.\nThe ballads\n(Try Me; Please, Please, Please; Bewildered; I Love You, Yes I Do)\nRooted in the traditions of gospel and blues, one of the greatest weapons James Brown’s arsenal is his ability to pour deep emotion into a soulful ballad. While some of his best songs like “Try Me” and “Please, Please, Please” were hits and undeniable classics, Brown brought that same ecstatic energy to ballads like “Bewildered” and “I Love You, Yes I Do.” With his strained, gravely voice, Brown was able to add a rough edge and sense of pleading urgency to these songs, a balladeer who could blur the lines between pain and pleasure, love and loss.\nThe origins of funk\n(I Got You (I Feel Good); Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag; I Got The Feelin’; Cold Sweat; Superbad Pt. 1&2; Ain’t It Funky Now; Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine; Get Up Offa That Thang)\nFor James Brown, the mid-to-late 60s were an incredibly prolific and innovative period. Not only did Brown produce several of his best songs in this period with cuts like “I Got You (I Feel Good),” “Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag,” “I Got The Feelin’,” he would ultimately change the course of music history by introducing a new rhythmic concept and compositional matrix into the fold. With 1967’s “Cold Sweat,” Brown placed heavy emphasis on the first beat of a song’s measure and repurposed melodic instruments into agents of rhythm. With this set of daring innovations, what we know today as funk was born. Whether it as the driving, hypnotic grooves of “Superbad Pt. 1&2” and “Ain’t It Funky Now” or flamboyant anthems like “Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine” and “Get Up Offa That Thang,” Brown would consistently prove that he was not only the inventor of the funk, but its chief innovator.\nJames Brown songs with a message\n(Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud; It’s a Man’s Man’s World; The Payback)\nAs fate would have it, the peak of James Brown’s popularity, as well as his creative prime, would coincide with (and in many ways inspire) both the Civil Rights era and the Black Power Movement. As with many of the United States’ great musicians, Brown also sought to express the frustrations and hopes of the people by injecting socially conscious messages into his music. “Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud” emphasized Black pride in a white-dominated world, while “It’s a Man’s Man’s World” celebrated the contributions of women. Oftentimes, Brown would just rap to the brothers and sisters on the street with cuts like “The Payback,” lending his voice to articulate the Black, working-class experience.\nHip-hop’s DNA\n(Funky Drummer; Give It Up or Turn It Loose; Blues And Pants; Mind Power; Papa Don’t Take No Mess)\nWhen hip-hop first emerged in the early 70s, DJs utilized\nthe funky grooves and pounding drum breaks of James Brown and the legions of bands that his best songs inspired. As sampling technology evolved, producers would once again turn to Brown, extracting snippets of horn riffs, basslines, screams, guitar licks, and drums to build entirely new collages of sound. The hypnotic, extended grooves of “Give It Up or Turn it Loose,” “Blues And Pants,” “Mind Power,” and “Papa Don’t Take No Mess” have all been sampled famously. “Funky Drummer,” however, is perhaps Brown’s greatest contribution to sampling culture. Showing up in hundreds if not thousands of songs, “Funky Drummer” has helped to shape the future of music to this day.\nThink we missed one of the best James Brown songs?

This is a direct violation of Title VI of federal civil rights law. UCLA appealed that ruling today. Breaking: UCLA has filed an appeal to the 9th Circuit challenging the injunction which ruled that the university could not allow the discrimination and exclusion of Jewish students on UCLA campus.— Eyal Yakoby (@EYakoby) UCLA continues to prove that they’re antisemitism is a systemic problem. [pic.twitter.com/2HliPFsqMy] [August 15, 2024] There is no other way to interpret this than the administration of UCLA condones antisemitism and discrimination against Jewish students. It is beyond despicable. They’re going to lose again.— The Flag Guy (@TheFlagGuy_) They’re always losers. [August 15, 2024] Yeah, they'll lose. But the fact they decided to appeal this decision speaks volumes about them. This is shocking behavior from a school with significant Jewish alumni.— Seth J. Riklin🎗️☮️🇺🇸🤠🇮🇱🛩 (@sethriklin) [August 15, 2024] Their hatred of Jews doesn't seem to extend to endowments, apparently. Here's proof that— David Wohl (@DavidWohl) [@UCLA]wants to continue its campaign of hate, harassment and intimidation against Jewish students. If this school is not shut down immediately by the feds, it will be when Trump reassumes office. [August 15, 2024] Recommended It will be an interesting case study to see what schools, if any, face consequences for blatantly violating federal civil rights laws. Jews should find a new university system to go to. These folks have lost their minds— Johnny Riggs 🐊 (@JohnnyRiggs9) [August 15, 2024] On one hand, we understand this thinking. Go where they won't discriminate against you. On the other hand, they have a right to be there and should fight to remove the systemic rot from UCLA and every other institution. UCLA really, really wants to discriminate— Nicole Levitt (@LevittNicole7) [https://t.co/vqadsOiNoQ] [August 15, 2024] YUP. They want to enable the pro-Hamas loons to do the dirty work for them. UCLA is adamant that anti-discrimination laws must not apply to Jews. Gavin Newsom is the head of the UC system and could stop UCLA from pursuing its anti-Semitic agenda. But he wants to be president someday and the Democrat Party does not tolerate opposition to Jew hatred.— Ayn Reagan (@AynReagan) [https://t.co/69WW5yEIIK] [August 15, 2024] There's a reason Kamala chose [Walz over Shapiro](https://twitchy.com/samj/2024/08/06/breaking-kamalas-vp-pick-is-n2399296) for her running mate. Seriously? UCLA is appealing this ruling? Maybe they should change their name from UCLA to hitler U.— Larree (@larreehollywood) [https://t.co/BRORwlE7DH] [August 15, 2024] Would be more fitting. Seriously, remember this when the Left accuses the right of being Nazis. Laugh in their faces. The real question remains, why hasn't the DoJ come in and shut down UCLA? Where is the— Yore Friend Whig 🇮🇱 (@WhigJust) [@CivilRights]Division? Do Jews not count? [https://t.co/Sg7KrruaAh] [August 15, 2024] Because Jews don't count. This writer will lay down the marker now: the DOJ will be much harder on schools that violate the new Title IX rules than they'll be on any college that allows discrimination against Jews.",

    "text": "Jerrell Maurice Grey, Justin Amari Banks, and Darius Lerenzo Mearis WALDORF, Md. – On April 22, detectives assigned to the Criminal Investigations Division Robbery Unit arrested five suspects, ages 17 to 21, who were identified as suspects in several armed robberies that go back to April 9, 2024.\nIn these cases, the suspects used a fake profile of a female on a social media dating app. People who responded to the profile were given directions to meet in the area of Amberleaf Place. When they arrived, the suspects robbed them at gunpoint, physically assaulted them, and stole money. The profile of the female changed in each case.\nAs a result of the investigation, detectives identified the suspects and served search warrants at six residences, recovering four handguns and evidence linking them to the robberies. Several of the suspects were arrested during the search warrants; however, one of the suspects, age 17, was arrested on his way to school at St. Charles High School. During that arrest, officers located a loaded privately made handgun – commonly known as a “ghost gun” – with an extended 30-round magazine concealed in the suspect’s pants.\nThe suspects have been identified as Darius Lerenzo Mearis, 21, of White Plains; Justin Amari Banks, 18, of Waldorf; Jerrell Maurice Grey, 20, of Waldorf, and two 17-year-old males from Waldorf (charged as adults). All of the suspects were charged with robbery, first-degree assault, second-degree assault, illegal possession of a firearm, and other related charges. The suspects are currently being held without bond at the Charles County Detention Center.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Detective Thayer at 301-609-6484.

    "text": "La energía solar fotovoltaica evita la emisión de 3,534 toneladas de CO2 anuales, según datos oficiales de SENER. (GOBIERNO DE CANARIAS) El Gobierno de México, a través de la Secretaría de Energía (SENER) y en colaboración con el Fideicomiso para el Ahorro de Energía Eléctrica (FIDE), ha implementado un programa que busca facilitar la instalación de sistemas fotovoltaicos en hogares mexicanos.\nSegún informó el sitio oficial de SENER y FIDE, este proyecto está dirigido a familias que enfrentan altos costos en sus recibos de electricidad , específicamente aquellas que pagan más de $1,500 pesos mensuales. El objetivo principal es reducir el gasto energético de los hogares y fomentar el uso de energías renovables .\nEl programa ofrece un esquema de apoyo financiero que combina un subsidio directo y un crédito con condiciones preferenciales. De acuerdo con la información publicada, la SENER otorga un incentivo equivalente al 25% del costo total del proyecto, mientras que el 75% restante es financiado por el FIDE a través de un crédito con una tasa de interés preferencial y un plazo de pago de hasta cinco años .\nUn programa que busca generar energía y reducir emisiones\nLas personas que rentan viviendas pueden obtener paneles solares si cumplen con requisitos, incluyendo autorización del propietario y un aval solidario. (REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo) Según los datos proporcionados por la SENER, hasta el momento se han realizado 1,206 proyectos de instalación de sistemas fotovoltaicos en hogares y una de las ventajas destacadas es que estos sistemas tienen una capacidad instalada total de 5 mil 102 kilovatios pico (kWp), lo que permite generar aproximadamente 7 millones 906 mil 680 kilovatios hora (kWh) al año.\nAdemás, esta iniciativa contribuye significativamente a la reducción de emisiones de dióxido de carbono , ya que, según su sitio oficial, evita la emisión de 3.534 toneladas de CO2 al año.\nSegún detalló la SENER, incluso las personas que rentan una vivienda pueden acceder al beneficio , siempre y cuando cumplan con ciertos requisitos. Entre estos se encuentran presentar una copia del contrato de arrendamiento, contar con la autorización expresa del propietario para la instalación del sistema y disponer de un aval solidario con propiedad libre de gravamen.\nPor otro lado, aquellos que actualmente tienen un bajo consumo de electricidad , pero planean adquirir equipos de alto consumo, también pueden participar. En estos casos, se realiza una evaluación del sistema fotovoltaico considerando la futura ampliación de la carga eléctrica.\nAsimismo, las personas que habitan en viviendas nuevas , donde aún no se registra un consumo significativo de energía, pueden acceder al programa mediante la elaboración de un cuadro de cargas que permita determinar la capacidad del sistema necesario y para acceder al programa, los interesados deben presentar una serie de documentos iniciales.\nSegún informó la SENER, estos incluyen una solicitud de crédito firmada, una carta de consulta al Buró de Crédito, una copia del recibo de electricidad con una antigüedad no mayor a dos meses, una copia de una identificación oficial (como credencial de elector, pasaporte o FM2 para extranjeros), una copia del Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC) y un comprobante de situación fiscal actualizado .\nEnergía fotovoltaica y su impacto en el medioambiente\nLa orientación arquitectónica y el diseño sostenible maximizan la eficiencia energética de la energía solar pasiva en edificios. (REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez) Según informó Selectra, un portal especializado en sostenibilidad, esta forma de obtener energía se ha convertido en una opción clave para avanzar hacia un desarrollo sostenible y de acuerdo con la misma fuente, la energía solar se clasifica en tres tipos principales: fotovoltaica, térmica y pasiva. Cada una de estas modalidades tiene características específicas que determinan su funcionamiento y aplicaciones.\nLa energía solar fotovoltaica, por ejemplo, utiliza paneles solares para convertir la radiación solar en electricidad mediante el efecto fotovoltaico. Por otro lado, la energía solar térmica se centra en la captación del calor del sol para calentar agua o generar vapor, mientras que la energía solar pasiva se basa en el diseño arquitectónico para aprovechar la luz y el calor solar sin necesidad de dispositivos mecánicos.\nSegún detalló Selectra, su funcionamiento se basa en el uso de paneles solares compuestos por células fotovoltaicas que transforman la radiación solar en electricidad. Esta tecnología es ampliamente utilizada tanto en instalaciones residenciales como en grandes plantas solares y su popularidad ha crecido significativamente debido a la reducción de costos en los últimos años.\nEntre sus principales aplicaciones se encuentran el autoconsumo energético en viviendas y empresas, así como la generación de electricidad a gran escala para abastecer redes eléctricas. Además, esta tecnología permite la instalación de sistemas aislados en zonas remotas donde no llega la red eléctrica, lo que contribuye a la electrificación de comunidades rurales.\nOtra modalidad destacada es la energía solar térmica, que se utiliza principalmente para calentar agua o generar vapor mediante colectores solares. Según explicó Selectra, este tipo de energía es común en sistemas de calefacción, climatización de piscinas y procesos industriales que requieren altas temperaturas.\nLos sistemas solares térmicos suelen ser más eficientes en términos de aprovechamiento energético que los fotovoltaicos, ya que convierten directamente la radiación solar en calor. Sin embargo, su implementación depende de factores como la ubicación geográfica y las necesidades específicas de cada usuario.\nLa energía solar pasiva, aunque menos conocida, juega un papel importante en el diseño sostenible de edificios . Según informó Selectra, esta modalidad no requiere dispositivos mecánicos, sino que se basa en el diseño arquitectónico para maximizar el aprovechamiento de la luz y el calor solar .\nEntre las estrategias utilizadas se encuentran la orientación adecuada de las edificaciones, el uso de materiales que retienen el calor y la incorporación de ventanas y tragaluces para optimizar la iluminación natural . Este enfoque no solo reduce el consumo energético, sino que también mejora el confort térmico en los espacios interiores.\nSegún destacó Selectra, entre las principales ventajas se encuentran su carácter renovable e inagotable , la reducción de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y la disminución de la dependencia de combustibles fósiles. Además, su implementación puede generar ahorros económicos a largo plazo , especialmente en sistemas de autoconsumo.\nSin embargo, enfrenta limitaciones como la intermitencia de la radiación solar, que depende de factores climáticos y horarios , así como de la necesidad de sistemas de almacenamiento energético para garantizar un suministro constante. Asimismo, los costos iniciales de instalación pueden ser elevados, aunque los apoyos en muchos países han reducido esta barrera.",

    "title": "From Buffering to Breakdown: What Went Wrong with Netflix’s Tyson vs. Jake Paul Live Stream?",
    "text": "In November 2024, Netflix faced significant issues during its live stream of the highly anticipated Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match. Despite being a leader in on-demand video streaming, the platform’s attempt to deliver live sports proved problematic, with widespread buffering, outages, and technical glitches that left many fans frustrated. This failure came at a crucial moment, as Netflix made its first major foray into live sports streaming. In contrast, platforms like Hotstar, known for its ability to handle millions of concurrent viewers, managed their live streams with ease. What went wrong for Netflix, and what can it learn from Hotstar’s robust infrastructure? This article explores the software architecture, challenges, and lessons learned from the Tyson vs. Paul streaming failure, comparing it with Hotstar’s success in live streaming. The Streaming Breakdown: Netflix’s Technical Issues Netflix, the world’s leading on-demand streaming service, has built an infrastructure optimized for delivering pre-recorded content. Its OpenConnect CDN (Content Delivery Network) is highly efficient for serving video content in a predictable, on-demand manner. However, live streaming events like the Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight are entirely different beasts — requiring real-time processing, low latency, and the ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Netflix’s OpenConnect CDN: Optimized for On-Demand, Not Live Events Netflix’s architecture is designed for on-demand streaming, not high-traffic live broadcasts. Here are the core components of its architecture: - OpenConnect CDN: Netflix uses its own global content delivery network, OpenConnect, to deliver pre-cached video content. The CDN caches videos at local Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks to reduce latency and deliver smooth playback. - Data Centers: Netflix uses distributed data centers around the world. For on-demand video, the company can predict traffic patterns and ensure videos are readily available in the most relevant data centers. However, live events introduce unpredictability. - Video Processing: Netflix pre-processes videos and stores them in various resolutions on OpenConnect servers. This is ideal for on-demand content but not sufficient for live streaming, which demands real-time encoding and adaptive bitrate streaming. The Challenges During Tyson vs. Paul When millions of viewers tried to tune into the Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight, Netflix’s infrastructure faced several critical issues: - Scalability: Netflix’s CDN struggled to handle the massive spike in traffic. Unlike on-demand streaming, where content is spread out over time, live events have an immediate and highly concurrent demand. - Latency and Buffering: Netflix’s on-demand approach, reliant on caching content in advance, led to high latency. Real-time live events require continuous streaming, which involves complex encoding and distribution. - Overloaded Servers: During peak moments, Netflix’s servers were overloaded and failed to route traffic efficiently. This resulted in 504 Gateway Timeouts and stream buffering, where viewers were left staring at loading screens. - Audio-Video Sync Issues: Live broadcasts require tight synchronization between video and audio, which Netflix’s infrastructure wasn’t fully prepared to handle. This led to audio delays and mismatched visuals, further diminishing the experience. Hotstar: A Benchmark for Live Streaming Hotstar, a streaming platform known for broadcasting major events like IPL (Indian Premier League) matches, sets a high standard in handling massive concurrent users. It achieved over 59 million concurrent users during a live cricket match in 2023. Multi-CDN Strategy and Real-Time Adaptability - Multi-CDN Architecture: Unlike Netflix, Hotstar employs a multi-CDN strategy. This means it uses several content delivery networks (such as Akamai, AWS CloudFront, and others) to dynamically distribute live content. This multi-CDN approach helps avoid the bottlenecks caused by a single CDN. - Edge Computing: Hotstar places content delivery closer to the user by using edge servers in various geographic locations. This reduces latency by serving video from a server that is physically closer to the viewer, resulting in faster load times and smoother playback. - Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR): Hotstar uses adaptive bitrate streaming to automatically adjust video quality based on the viewer’s network conditions. If a user’s internet connection slows down, the platform adjusts the video quality to avoid buffering, ensuring continuous playback. - Scalability: Hotstar’s infrastructure is highly scalable, with automatic load balancing and the ability to handle massive traffic spikes, especially during live sports events. The system can dynamically allocate resources and bandwidth as needed. - Real-Time Encoding: Hotstar’s architecture supports real-time encoding and processing, ensuring that video is delivered as quickly as possible without noticeable delays. Handling High-Concurrency and Live Events Hotstar has successfully managed millions of concurrent viewers during sports events like IPL and international cricket matches. It achieves this by: - Efficiently distributing live video streams across multiple data centers. - Using scalable systems that can allocate more resources as user traffic increases. - Ensuring redundancy and failover systems to prevent server overloads. Comparing the Two Architectures Lessons Netflix Can Learn from Hotstar’s Success - Adopt a Multi-CDN Strategy: Netflix should integrate a multi-CDN setup to manage high traffic volumes, particularly during live events. This will ensure better load balancing and less reliance on a single CDN. - Real-Time Streaming Infrastructure: Live events require a real-time streaming pipeline with adaptive bitrate and real-time encoding. Netflix should consider integrating a similar approach to ensure smooth delivery of live content. - Edge Computing: Hotstar’s use of edge computing ensures faster delivery and lower latency. Netflix should implement a similar system to bring content closer to the user, especially during live events where latency is critical. - Scalability and Traffic Management: The ability to scale quickly during unexpected traffic surges is key to handling live events. Netflix should enhance its infrastructure to dynamically allocate resources based on real-time traffic demands. - Redundancy and Failover: Hotstar’s multi-CDN strategy also provides redundancy in case of failures. Netflix can benefit from implementing failover mechanisms to prevent crashes and improve overall reliability. Conclusion Netflix’s failure during the Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight highlights the significant differences between streaming on-demand content and live events. While Netflix’s infrastructure is highly efficient for on-demand streaming, it lacks the real-time capabilities necessary for live broadcasts. Hotstar, on the other hand, has honed its system over the years to handle massive live traffic spikes, providing a smoother, more resilient experience. As Netflix continues to expand into live sports streaming, adopting some of the strategies that Hotstar has perfected will be crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of its broadcasts.

    "text": "A former tabloid publisher and key witness for the prosecution testified that he purchased stories about professional golfer Tiger Woods, former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, among others during questioning by defense attorneys for former President Trump. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office brought David Pecker, their first witness, to the stand for the third day Thursday. Pecker is the former CEO of American Media Inc., the parent company of publications such as the National Enquirer, who has known Trump stretching back to the 1980s. Prosecutors allege that Pecker worked closely with the Trump campaign to bury negative information about Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Trump is accused of falsifying records related to the alleged \\\"catch and kill\\\" scheme. Pecker testified that he purchased negative stories about Trump before the 2016 election and did not publish them — known as a \\\"catch and kill\\\" scheme. The stories included allegations from adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal about affairs with Trump. NY PROSECUTORS REVEAL 'ANOTHER CRIME' TRUMP ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO CONCEAL WITH FALSIFIED BUSINESS RECORDS With regard to negative stories coming out about Trump before the election, Pecker testified that Trump was concerned about what his family would say about it, specifically about how it would impact his wife Melania Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump. Pecker also testified that Trump was concerned about what the impact would be on his campaign in 2016. But under cross-examination by Trump defense attorney Emil Bove, Pecker testified he purchased stories about other high-profile individuals besides Trump. Pecker testified he purchased a story about professional golfer Tiger Woods, and a story about Rahm Emanuel in 2009 after he left the Obama White House. Pecker said he purchased the story about an alleged affair Emanuel had so that it would not be published. Emanuel also later served as ambassador to Japan. TRUMP TRIAL: FORMER PRESIDENT 'INNOCENT,' DEFENSE SAYS AS DA ALLEGES 'CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY' Pecker also testified that he worked with Trump attorney Michael Cohen in his capacity as the former president’s personal attorney — not as part of the 2016 campaign. Pecker testified that American Media Inc., the owner of the National Enquirer, testified that before purchasing stories, the company would vet them for truthfulness. He also testified that there were instances AMI would purchase a story to use as leverage. When asked if this was standard, Pecker testified: \\\"Yes.\\\" Pecker also said Thursday that Trump \\\"was my mentor.\\\" \\\"He helped me throughout my career,\\\" Pecker said, saying Trump was often the first person to call him when he needed help. \\\"Even though we haven’t spoken, I still considered him a friend,\\\" Pecker said. Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Bragg alleges that Trump ex-attorney Michael Cohen orchestrated hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to prevent them from sharing their stories about alleged affairs with Trump. Bragg is trying to prove that Trump was aware of those payments, and allegedly falsified records of payments to Cohen as \\\"legal expenses\\\" rather than repayments for the hush money. NY VS TRUMP: THE EVIDENCE PROSECUTORS CAN PRESENT IF FORMER PRESIDENT TESTIFIES Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts and told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview on Thursday that he was simply paying Cohen legal fees because Cohen was his lawyer. Bragg also alleged American Media Inc., which Pecker was the CEO of, allegedly employed the \\\"catch and kill\\\" strategy to bury stories — specifically Karen McDougal's. Bragg and prosecutors sought to convince the jury that Pecker's work to do this was made with the blessing of Trump's 2016 campaign.

Pecker's cross-examination is expected to continue Friday morning.",

    "title": "\"Perdidos en el Amazonas\": la historia de tres niños y un bebé, que sobrevivieron 40 días en la naturaleza",
    "text": "Era el 1 de mayo de 2023 cuando se registró el accidente, pero fue hasta días después que las autoridades dieron con el automotor. Foto: Max Le llamaron Operación Esperanza porque no había otra manera de seguir adelante. Cuatro niños de 13, 9 y 4 años de edad, más un bebé de 11 meses, habían sido pasajeros de un avión caído en la selva colombiana, pero no se tenía rastro de ellos. Era el 1 de mayo de 2023 cuando se registró el accidente, pero fue hasta días después que las autoridades dieron con el automotor y encontrando únicamente los cuerpos de los tres adultos que los acompañaban, incluída su madre. Se movilizaron más de 200 personas entre el ejército cafetalero y la guardia indígena a fin de dar con el paradero de los pequeños, transcurriendo 39 días sin rastro de ellos. Lo que pasó se cuenta en el documental “Perdidos en el Amazonas”, recién lanzado en la plataforma streaming MAX, confeccionado expresamente con videos encontrados y proporcionados por testigos de la travesía. “Se convirtió en una historia universal prácticamente desde el principio, pero sobre todo a partir del momento en el que se encuentra la avioneta y descubren que esos cuatro niños no están, teniendo entonces la simple posibilidad de que pudieran estar vivos”, comenta Cristina Nieto, co directora española del filme. La película se ve enriquecida con entrevistas al tío de los niños, al dueño de la aeronave y los militares que participaron en la búsqueda. Todos los materiales que se ven son los originales levantados durante la travesía, la única intervención que se les hizo fue ponerlos en blanco y negro. “Nicolás, por ejemplo, que es uno de los buscadores indígenas, nos regaló el momento en que los encontraron. Todo está contado en primera persona, no hay una sola voz narrando todo. Lo que tú escuchas que dice Nicolás cuando los encuentran, es real, todo ese sonido, el canto que hace, son momentos que pasaron ese día”, destaca Jaime Escallón, guionista y co director. “El blanco y negro nos ayudaba a puntualizar y a dramatizar determinados hechos y era una apuesta arriesgada porque no se utiliza mucho ahora. Pero era para ver la memoria, nosotros tenemos mucho de nuestro pasado en blanco y negro, no a colores y además nos permitía hacia el final del documental, entrar a un mundo imaginario”, ataja Clara. Para la elaboración de “Perdidos en el Amazonas” se contó con la colaboración de José Alejandro Castaño, periodista cercano a lo ocurrido y parte de la unidad investigativa del documental. “Soy colombiano y he contado historias sobre selvas y bosques amazónicos, pero de repente por circunstancias extraordinarias, terminé acompañando la misión militar en la búsqueda de los niños, con todo ese ejército humanitario que se configuró a partir de la de los indígenas y que no es algo habitual”, relata el comunicador. “Se habían destinado 120 comandos de la máxima graduación y estaban unos 78- 80 indígenas y casi a los 40 días estaba claro que ya no iban a continuar la búsqueda y si encontraban algo serían sus cadáveres. Fue cuando se decidió hacer un último esfuerzo”, añade. El 9 de junio, 40 días después del accidente aéreo, los niños fueron hallados con signos de desnutrición y trauma, pero vivos. En su camino habían sido encontrados ramas y palos tirados, un biberón, una fruta medio comer, que daban precisamente la esperanza de una conclusión positiva. rad",
