    "text": "[Cheri Carlson](/staff/4406860002/cheri-carlson/) The National Weather Service has issued high surf and coastal flood warnings for Ventura County, urging the public to stay off beaches, coastal walkways, piers and jetties. Dangerous waves pummeled the Ventura coast Thursday, damaging structures, flooding roads and injuring several people. With high surf expected through Saturday , officials have closed many local beaches, harbors, coastal campgrounds and parks. Here's what is closed locally as of Friday morning: - City beaches in Ventura and at the Ventura Harbor - All California State Parks beaches and day-use areas in Ventura and Oxnard – Emma Wood, San Buenaventura, McGrath and Mandalay - Oxnard public beaches - County of Ventura beaches and parks – Faria, Hobson, Rincon Parkway RV Area, Kiddy, Silver Strand and Hollywood - Silver Strand Beach parking lot - Port Hueneme Pier - Ventura Pier - Thornhill Broome campground off Pacific Coast Highway - North Beach and Group Camp campgrounds at Emma Wood State Beach Faria Beach campground near Ventura.

    "text": "Australian Electoral Commission under cyber attacks ‘almost every day’\nThe gateway to Australia’s democracy is coming under attack “almost every day” but there’s a desperate plan in place to stop it from happening.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) said it was boosting its cyber defences ahead of the federal election, with the agency expecting an increase in attacks leading up to this year’s federal election.\nThe move comes amid a wave of cyberattacks on the country’s biggest government agencies, banking institutions and other organisations.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nActing AEC Commissioner, Jeff Pope, told 7NEWS.com.au this week “there’s actors trying to penetrate our door almost every day, during non-election time and absolutely more so in election time”.\nIt’s a concern echoed by executive director of cyber intelligence at Australian cyber security company CyberCX Katherine Mansted.\n“There are more foreign governments than ever that have the means and desire to target our democratic institutions, like elections,” she told 7NEWS.com.au.\n“It’s all about just making sure we’ve got that resourcing, and that attention matched to what our foreign adversaries will be investing in because no doubt they will be considering their position and whether it’s worth probing the vulnerabilities of our democracy.”\nCyber Security Shadow Minister, James Paterson, expressed concern about overseas influence adding “it’s virtually certain that some actors, including foreign actors, will try and exert their influence over this election”.\nThe AEC is working alongside Australia’s security agencies and is “alert to both” attacks from foreign and domestic operators.\n“We’ve withstood all of that incredibly successfully, we’ve been able to move with increased threats and deter and resist those,” the organisation said.\n“We are working with our national security and intelligence partners to make sure that we have got absolutely the best protections in place around those cyber security measures.”\nThe local response comes after Romania’s constitutional court annulled its election results last month when declassified documents revealed evidence that cyberattacks, and foreign interference influenced its election results.\nLecturer in cybercrime at the University of Portsmouth Anda Solea commented on the annulled election, saying “Romania was the target of over 85,000 cyberattacks before and during election day”.\n“These attacks disrupted the IT and communication infrastructure supporting the electoral process,” Solea said.\n“The declassification of documents by Romanian intelligence services ... exposed evidence of voting manipulation through social media platforms, illegal campaign financing on TikTok, cyber-attacks orchestrated by external forces and suspected Russian interference.”\nPaterson slammed Labor’s response to foreign interference and said the government needed to do more.\n“I’m very concerned that the Federal Government has done very little to actually prepare against the serious risk of foreign interference through social media during the election... public opinion can be influenced by social media, particularly through foreign-headquartered social media platforms (such as TikTok),” Paterson said.\nThe attack on Romania’s election is not the first time Moscow has been accused of election interference with a US intelligence committee finding “ample evidence to suggest that the Russian government was developing and implementing capabilities to interfere in the 2016 elections, including undermining confidence in US democratic institutions and voting processes”.\nHowever, since 2016, artificial intelligence technology has grown in sophistication, increasing the number of tools available to bad actors.\nKatherine Manstead noted that although Australia has one of the most resilient electoral systems in the world, it is important to remain alert.\n“The threat actors are multiplying and they’re more determined than ever before ... We will see, no doubt some threat actors attempt to interfere with or attempt to target our elections.”\nThe AEC said it was concerned about AI-instigated cyberattacks on the commission, but is confident in its existing defence strategy.\n“We are absolutely enhancing all of our cyber defences in order to protect our systems and particularly our election management system and the election results.”\nPope said that he was “comfortable” with the current arrangements the AEC has in place related to artificial intelligence and that they would “consider what that legislative framework needs to look like going forward.”\n“Nothing is ever 100 per cent certain and the sophistication level of cyberattacks as we’ve seen around the globe is increasing and, again, we are very alert, not yet alarmed,” he said.\nThe Annual Cyber Threat Report revealed that Australians can expect more cyberattacks from foreign nations as tensions continue to rise.\n“The threat of state-sponsored cyber operations is persistent and will likely grow as strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific increases.”\n“State-sponsored cyber actors will continue targeting Australian governments, critical infrastructure, and businesses, as well as connected systems and their supply chains, for espionage and information-gathering purposes,” the report found.\nOriginally published on 7NEWS",

El [desierto del Sahara](https://www.elimparcial.com/tags/desierto-del-sahara/) es conocido por ser una de las zonas más calientes, desoladas y por supuesto aridas del [mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/), ha sido escenario de un fenómeno poco común: intensas lluvias abarcaron la gran y cálida región. Este evento, ocurrido entre septiembre y principios de octubre de 2024, ha cambiado temporalmente el paisaje de las arenas del Sahara, creando cuerpos de agua donde antes solo había sequedad.

En lugares como Tagounite, las precipitaciones alcanzaron más de 100 milímetros en solo 24 horas, superando con creces el promedio anual. 🇪🇭 | Por primera vez en décadas, el desierto del Sahara se inundó: “Aparecieron lagunas azules con agua en el famoso desierto entre palmeras y dunas de arena\". — ☨ ⚜ Espíritu Templario News ⚜ ✠ (@NonNobis10)[pic.twitter.com/SV4WMjgSck][October 10, 2024] Se dice que la cantidad recibida de lluvias en varios días es equivalente a lo que el Sahara ha recibido en años. Este fenómeno ha sido descrito por meteorólogos como uno de los eventos más significativos de las últimas décadas, debido a la intensidad y la rapidez con que las lluvias cayeron sobre el desierto, incluso pintando ciertas zonas del desierto de verde. El regreso del lago Iriqui Uno de los impactos más notables de estas lluvias ha sido el llenado del lago Iriqui, un lecho seco ubicado entre las regiones de Zagora y Tata que llevaba cinco décadas sin recibir agua. Las imágenes provenientes del desierto han mostrado que el agua ha vuelto a regiones, generando una especie de oasis temporal, pasando de la sequedad extrema a mostrar un nuevo lago donde solo había arena. ¿Un ejemplo del cambio climático? Las lluvias inusuales en el Sahara ha encendido la conversación sobre la realidad del cambio climático en el mundo, destacando un efecto en cadena que podría dejar un gran impacto. El fenómeno de lluvias inusuales en el Sahara ha planteado preguntas sobre el impacto del cambio climático en la región. Científicos y meteorólogos han señalado que estas precipitaciones podrían ser un indicio de alteraciones en los patrones climáticos tradicionales. Los científicos están analizando la posible conexión entre estas lluvias y el cambio climático, así como el desplazamiento de la Zona de Convergencia Intertropical (ZCIT), que podría haber facilitado el transporte de humedad hacia el norte del Sahara. Este tipo de fenómeno podría ser un indicio de cambios a largo plazo en los patrones climáticos de la región, que podrían volver más comunes las precipitaciones en zonas que históricamente han sido extremadamente secas.

    "title": "Florida priest accused of biting woman during communion dispute",
    "text": "A priest could face charges after he allegedly bit a woman during a dispute over the Holy Communion at a [Florida](/tag/florida) church. The alleged incident happened Sunday at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St. Cloud, less than 30 miles south of Orlando. According to a St. Cloud Police report, the incident happened during Mass. The woman told police that when she went to receive communion, the priest allegedly refused because he claimed she hadn't performed the prerequisite of Confession required by the Catholic Church to receive the Eucharist. When the woman responded that she had done so, the priest became upset and she said he tried to ram the communion wafer into her mouth, according to the report.

[Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.] She said she then placed her hand in the vessel and tried to grab another wafer, \"crushing them,\" the report said. The priest allegedly struggled with the woman, \"who refused to let go,\" and that's when the priest \"bit her hand so she would let go.\" In an interview with police captured on body camera video, the priest can be heard saying the woman attacked him first. \"She pushed me and grabbed, and I have the bowl with the holy host, for us is sacred, and she grabbed all the hosts in her hands because she wants to receive for herself, which is not permitted,\" the priest explained. Local He admitted to biting the woman's arm after he said she wouldn't let go of the communion tray. The Diocese of Orlando said the priest responded in a way that was aimed \"to protect the Holy Communion from this sacrilegious act.\" \"While the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion,\" it said. The Eucharist, the church said, \"is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere 'cookie' as the complainant called it.\" The priest hasn't been arrested, but the woman said she plans on pressing charges. The police department turned information over to the state attorney's office for review.",

    "title": "BRICS challenges Western sanctions amid US ‘theft’ of sovereign assets",
    "text": "In a recent policy shift, the US government, under President Joe Biden, has taken steps to leverage frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict. The announcement, made by Biden on October 23, revealed the US’s intention to use these frozen funds to repay a US$20 billion loan extended to Ukraine, which is part of a broader US$50 billion aid package by the G7 nations. This move has sparked outrage from Moscow, which views it as “theft” being elevated to the level of official government policy.\nThe Russian Embassy in the US quickly condemned the decision, describing it as a significant escalation in the use of seized sovereign assets, labeling it a neocolonial approach led by a “small group of countries”. The embassy stressed that these actions are not only illegal but have been broadly rejected on the international stage. Russia has maintained that the confiscation of its assets, which began soon after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, would be seen as theft, and it has warned of possible retaliatory actions.\nAccording to Biden, the decision to use windfall profits from blocked Russian funds to aid Ukraine allows for financial assistance without burdening US taxpayers. Since the conflict’s escalation, Washington has provided Ukraine with over US$64 billion in military aid, making it Kiev’s largest benefactor in the war. Biden’s latest move further entrenches US involvement, with the new financial package aiming to assist Ukraine’s war efforts and recovery without causing additional strain on domestic budgets.\nThis development comes on the heels of similar announcements from the European Union and the United Kingdom, both of which have also promised loans to Ukraine, with repayments drawn from frozen Russian assets. These steps signify a growing trend among Western nations to utilize confiscated Russian funds to support Ukraine’s war effort and its recovery, a move that Russia strongly opposes.\nThe broader international response to this strategy has been critical. The Russian Embassy highlighted the outcome of the BRICS summit in Kazan, where the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) condemned these actions. The summit resulted in a joint declaration that called for multilateral efforts to construct a new, independent financial architecture, one that would protect countries from the “illegal actions” being promoted by Western powers. This aligns with BRICS’ broader opposition to unilateral sanctions, which the group sees as undermining global trade and economic stability.\nThe Kazan Declaration, adopted by the BRICS nations, is a clear expression of their vision for a fairer international order. The group reaffirmed its commitment to a multipolar world, where no single country or bloc holds overwhelming sway over global affairs. In this context, they condemned Western sanctions, particularly the freezing of Russian sovereign assets, as unlawful and inconsistent with the principles of international law.\nThe declaration also emphasized the need for all nations to have equal representation in global governance structures. This is a long-standing grievance of BRICS members, who argue that institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank remain too heavily influenced by Western interests. BRICS countries have called for reforms to these organizations to give emerging economies a greater voice. The group also promoted the use of local currencies in trade between BRICS nations and their partners, aiming to reduce reliance on the US dollar and euro in global commerce.\nThe freezing of Russian assets in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, estimated at around US$300 billion, has had significant implications for the global financial system. Despite pressure from some quarters to permanently confiscate these assets, the IMF has resisted the move, fearing that such a step could erode trust in the Western-dominated financial architecture. Moscow has consistently labeled these actions as theft and has vowed to respond in kind if its assets are seized permanently.\nThe Kazan Declaration also addressed other pressing global issues, including the Ukraine conflict. However, the BRICS nations have maintained a neutral stance on the war, refusing to fully back either side. Instead, the group has called for a peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy, in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter. This contrasts with the approach taken by Western nations, particularly the US, which continues to provide extensive military and financial support to Ukraine.\nBRICS leaders have stressed that unilateral sanctions, like those imposed on Russia, have a disproportionately negative impact on developing countries and global economic stability. They pointed out that such measures often hinder progress towards achieving sustainable development goals, as they exacerbate poverty and inequality in the targeted nations. The Kazan Declaration also criticized the use of economic measures disguised as environmental or climate concerns, which it claims are used to justify protectionist policies that disrupt global supply chains and create unfair competition.\nThe declaration’s strong language reflects growing frustration within BRICS about Western hegemony in global trade and finance. The group’s leaders are pushing for greater cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), and they have opened the door for new members to join BRICS in the future. This would expand the bloc’s influence and potentially reshape the global economic order.\nWhile the Ukraine conflict has drawn significant attention from the international community, the Kazan Declaration made it clear that the BRICS nations view the war as just one of many issues facing the world. For them, the focus remains on building a more inclusive and balanced global system, one that allows for sovereign equality and rejects the coercive measures currently favored by the West.\nIn conclusion, the US’s decision to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine marks a significant escalation in the use of sovereign funds as a tool of war. This has drawn sharp criticism from Russia and its allies, who view the move as illegal and destabilizing. The Kazan Declaration, adopted at the recent BRICS summit, provides a counter-narrative to Western policies, promoting a vision of global governance that rejects unilateral actions and prioritizes multilateral cooperation. The declaration also highlights the need for a new financial architecture that protects countries from the kinds of coercive measures currently being employed by the US and its allies.\nPlease follow Blitz on Google News Channel",

    "text": "François Cluzet bouleversant sur son enfance difficile : “On a vécu des trucs très dangereux”\nFrançois Cluzet, actuellement au théâtre avec la pièce Encore une journée Divine, s’est confié à cœur ouvert à propos de son enfance difficile dans les colonnes de Paris Match.\nPasser la publicité\nÀ propos de\nDes confidences bouleversantes... François Cluzet fait son grand retour sur les planches après 25 ans d’absence avec la pièce Encore une journée Divine, au Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens, à partir de ce jeudi 30 janvier, dans laquelle il incarne un psychologue interné en hôpital psychiatrique. Le comédien s’est confié à l’occasion de ce nouveau projet sur scène dans les colonnes du magazine Paris Match sur les traumatismes de son enfance qui l’ont mené à suivre une thérapie pendant huit ans. « Je vivais un traumatisme d’enfance. Je n’arrivais pas à démêler qui avait fait quoi entre mon père et ma mère. Ma mère est partie quand j’avais huit ans. Mon père est devenu dépressif et on a vécu mon frère et moi des trucs très dangereux », partage-t-il, et d’ajouter : « Même si, sur le moment, j’ai aimé mon enfance, comme tous les gosses, je me suis marré en classe, je déconnais, tout allait bien. Mais lorsque le succès est arrivé tout ça m’est tombé sur la gueule. »\nL’acteur a commencé à faire face à ses traumatismes à l’âge de 19, lorsqu’il était au Cours Simon. Il voulait travailler sur sa sensibilité et c’est alors mis à boire et à consommer des drogues. « Cela a fini par me jouer des tours. Parce que, en recherchant cette émotion, tous les traumas de mon enfance que j’avais enfouis sont revenus », révèle-t-il sur cette période compliquée de sa vie. François Cluzet, qui est aujourd’hui plus amoureux que jamais, a alors été orienté vers un psychologue par sa compagne de l’époque qui ne savait pas comment lui venir en aide. « À la première séance, je balance tout. En trois quarts d’heure, je lui explique que j’ai beaucoup de défauts. \"Mais le seul que je n’ai pas, c’est que je ne suis pas égoïste.\" La thérapeute m’a dit: \"Alors on va travailler là-dessus.\" Ça a duré huit ans », conclut-il. Il peut maintenant compter sur le soutien de sa femme Narjiss lorsqu’il traverse des moments difficiles.\nFrançois Cluzet : ses tendres confidences sur son amitié avec Omar Sy\nFrançois Cluzet n’oublie pas son rôle bouleversant dans le film Intouchables, réalisé par Olivier Nakache et Éric Toledano, sorti le 2 novembre 2011, dans lequel il donne la république à Omar Sy. Il s’est confié dans les colonnes de La Provence à propos de leur performance mémorable dans le long-métrage qui a eu le droit à un remake américain. « Je l’aime beaucoup. Non seulement il est très drôle, et humainement, c’est un type d’une grande élégance », a-t-il confié à propos de son ami, avant de poursuivre sur leur prestation dans le long-métrage : « C’était facile de faire en sorte qu’on puisse croire à cette amitié. »",
