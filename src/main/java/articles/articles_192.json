    "text": "New Delhi: Meta introduced Threads, its text-based platform, on July 5, 2023, racing past 100 million users in just five days. But what started as a sprint stumbled quickly; daily active users plummeted within weeks due to limited features like no desktop access or trending topic engagement. Now, Meta plans to roll out ads on Threads in early 2025.\nWhile Meta’s advertising empire is formidable, the ad world is eyeing this move with a mix of intrigue and scepticism.\nRooshabh Doshi, Co-founder, of Nuance Consultancy, said, “Meta has tried its hand out with targeting through other placements such as its app network and Messenger, but those placements have not really worked for advertisers.\nThreads still don’t have a loyal following and even though they may be bandy about numbers about the number of accounts registered, the majority of them are inactive and had an account created by default through Instagram. Engagement so far is really poor on threads and even though we have tried experiments with brands that have a fair amount of followers, the engagement rate is terrible.”\nOn the contrary, Ankush Vij, Vice President of Media, Hashtag Orange, believes that while the platform’s slower user growth has raised some questions, its seamless integration within the Meta ecosystem gives advertisers confidence.\n“Marketers are excited about the opportunity to experiment with campaigns on a platform designed for real-time, spontaneous engagement. They see this as an opportunity to capitalise on Threads’ cleaner, less cluttered space to connect with more targeted, niche audiences. With its fresh approach, advertisers are keen to test new ad formats and drive more authentic conversations, hoping to differentiate themselves from the competition on other social platforms and build stronger, more meaningful connections with users,” he said.\nThrowing light on early conversations surrounding brands’ interest in advertising on the platform, Vij said that although Meta has not publicly disclosed specific brand partnerships on Threads, there is clear interest from major global brands, especially those familiar with X’s (formerly Twitter) conversational model. Brands in tech, entertainment, and FMCG, sectors that thrive on real-time engagement, are likely to test the waters.\nChaaya Baradhwaaj, Founder and Managing Director at BC Web Wise, added, “While there’s curiosity about the platform in the advertising community, most brands are taking a wait-and-watch approach, seeking more clarity on user adoption, engagement levels, and the unique opportunities Threads can provide beyond Instagram and Facebook.”\nThreads, launched by Meta's Instagram team in July 2023, is a text-based social app designed to foster real-time conversations in a microblogging format. With a focus on community-driven engagement, it quickly gained momentum, surpassing 175 million monthly users within its first year.\nAccording to Vij, Threads focuses on authentic, dialogue-driven engagement, making it ideal for brands aiming to build trust and spark meaningful conversations. “This approach complements Meta’s other platforms, allowing advertisers to engage users more directly and foster deeper connections, creating a well-rounded advertising ecosystem,” he said.\nWhile the platform fosters an ecosystem for authentic, real-time conversations, marketers remain uncertain about its potential to drive sustained engagement. Threads faces challenges in keeping its user base engaged, with active users dropping from over 100 million sign-ups to around 25–30 million by late 2024. The engagement has fallen 79% from its peak (reports). Meta’s strategy to reignite interest includes sending Threads notifications via Instagram, and leveraging its ecosystem to remind users of the platform’s features. However, these cross-platform nudges may not suffice to reverse the trend.\nMihir Mehta, Managing Partner at 0101, said, “Threads currently has around 275 million users globally, with an average user engagement on Threads of just 3 minutes, which is still very low as compared to Instagram. So from the current data, it’s very difficult to gauge what the user engagement on ads would be.\nTo truly re-engage users, Threads may need to introduce features that differentiate them from competitors and address specific audience needs. For instance, better content discovery, trends or niche community-building tools could make the app more appealing. Additionally, integrating real-time events, exclusive content, or gamified elements might drive sustained engagement.”\nDoshi fears that the engagement rates could see a decline by more percentage points. “I fear the engagement could become even worse. Some of the Threads users like the platform as advertisers haven’t reached there yet and some of the content consumed is more relevant.\nAs a social media platform, it’s important to achieve critical mass first before jumping into advertising. I have a feeling that ads will be introduced for very selective brands in India and will take time to roll out to all advertisers due to a lack of audience,” Doshi resolved.\nGiven the dominance of Instagram among Gen-Z and the popularity of Facebook among middle-aged adults, asking users to pay attention to a text-based platform that does not offer quick dopamine, Meta will have to innovate to make sure it gets users equally interested in Threads.\nShedding light on the subject, Doshi said, “It will be a massive challenge, but one of the advantages is its massive advertising ecosystem. Meta will offer Threads as just another placement through Ads Manager, which advertisers may pick by default if they pick automatic placements. Threads will also be activated through Advantage + campaigns. I think there will be very few advertisers who will willingly want to advertise on the platform.\nIf Meta can also somehow prove that there is a specific demographic on Threads who are not on Instagram and Facebook, then that could help. Meta could also pitch advertising based on keyword and hashtag searches—something that to date is not widely used through other platforms.\nA combination of keyword searches and interest/demographic/behaviour targeting could be powerful, but that’s only if there is an active audience on Threads. Meta needs to first solve for that. Monetisation opportunities via ads could attract influencers and content creators, leading to more engaging and diverse content, which in turn could re-engage dormant users.”\nAs per Baradhwaaj (BC Web Wise), engaging a dormant user base is Meta’s biggest challenge before starting with ads on the platform.\nShe continued, “The primary challenge for Meta will be reactivating users who signed up for Threads but didn’t find compelling reasons to stay engaged. Without strong, unique content formats or differentiated user experiences, the platform risks being perceived as redundant. Meta will need to invest in exclusive features and creator-driven content to spark user interest and re-engagement.”\nMeta also needs to activate its vast Facebook and Instagram audiences, perhaps through deeper integrations, shared content flows, or incentives for using Threads, said Mehta. “Without significant innovation, the platform risks losing momentum in an increasingly competitive social media landscape.”\nAmidst the challenges, the question that comes to the forefront is: what strategies will Meta use to ensure a seamless user experience while introducing ads on Threads?\nGiving her take on the subject, Baradhwaaj said, “Meta will likely adopt a phased approach, starting with non-intrusive ad formats like promoted posts or conversational ads that align with Threads’ tone. The focus will be on maintaining the platform's simplicity and authenticity. Additionally, Meta’s advanced AI capabilities could ensure ads are hyper-targeted, making them feel like a natural extension of the user experience.”\nViren Vesuwala, Lead - Strategic Partnerships and Alliances at White Rivers Media, concluded that the real opportunity lies in Threads' ability to foster genuine conversations. He said, “Meta's challenge isn't just about reactivating users or introducing ads—it's about demonstrating how the platform enriches digital conversations in ways others cannot. Brands that understand and respect this conversational essence while adding authentic value to discussions will find receptive audiences, creating a natural harmony between user experience and advertising effectiveness.”",

    "text": "Iowa's Dominance in Attracting Audiences\nThe Iowa women's basketball team is a key player in this trend. Its games against formidable opponents like Ohio State and Nebraska garnered staggering viewership numbers — 3.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively. This remarkable attraction to Iowa’s games indicates a growing interest in women's sports and positions the team as a major draw for audiences.\nHistorical Viewership Records in Women’s Basketball\nThis rise in viewership isn't just a fleeting trend. Over the years, audience sizes for women's college basketball have shown consistent growth, culminating in the 2023 national championship game between Iowa and LSU, which drew an impressive 9.9 million viewers. This record-breaking number not only marked the most-watched women's college basketball game in history but also surpassed ESPN's previous records for any college basketball viewership, whether men’s or women’s.\nTicket Sales and Pricing Trends\nUnprecedented Demand in the NCAA Women’s Basketball Season\n\"The 2023-2024 NCAA Women's College Basketball season witnessed a remarkable surge in ticket demand,\" according to Chris Cabrera, the CDO of Barry's Ticket Service . \"With games consistently selling out and a notable increase in single-game and season ticket purchases, the demand for women's basketball is palpable. This heightened interest is exemplified by the historic sell-out of the 2024 Big Ten Women’s Basketball Tournament - a first in its 30-year history\".\nPricing Gap Between Men’s and Women’s Championships\n\"Interestingly, the ticket prices for women's basketball events have substantially increased,\" Cabrera pointed out. \"The \"get-in\" price for the 2024 NCAA Women's Basketball Championship game stands at $390, significantly higher than the $192 price for the Men's Championship. This disparity is even more pronounced in the Final Four get-in prices, with women's tickets reaching $774 compared to men’s at $242. This pricing trend underscores the growing market value and appeal of women's college basketball.\"\"\nThe Sweet Sixteen Ticket Trends\nIn regional tournaments, such as the Albany 2 Region, featuring top teams like Iowa, LSU, and UCLA, ticket prices reflect the heightened interest in women's college basketball. The Sweet Sixteen get-in ticket prices in these regions currently range from $225 to $227, further emphasizing the sport's burgeoning popularity.\nAdvertisement Revenues and Strategic Shifts\nA Surge in Advertisement Investments\nThe skyrocketing viewership of the 2023 Women’s National Championship has catalyzed a significant rise in advertising pricing and demand. For instance, ad slots for the title game are now priced around $500,000, starkly contrasting the previously under $100,000 slots. This exponential increase indicates the growing commercial value of women’s college basketball.\nAd Strategies Mimicking the Super Bowl\nFollowing these trends, networks adopt innovative ad sales strategies like those employed during the Super Bowl. Advertisers must commit to additional spending on other women’s sports to secure slots during women's college basketball tournament broadcasts. This strategy, pioneered by ESPN, necessitates a minimum spend of $1 million, fostering broader support and investment in women's athletics.\nThe Role of Advertising Companies\nTatari, a TV advertising and data company, is at the forefront of this new advertising landscape. With plans to feature at least a dozen clients in both Men's and Women's March Madness across various platforms, they are capitalizing on the surging popularity of women's basketball. Their consistent presence during Iowa’s games throughout the season is a testament to women's sports' growing interest and commercial viability.\nThe Cultural Phenomenon of Women’s College Basketball\nThe 2023-2024 women's college basketball season represents more than just impressive statistics; it signifies a cultural phenomenon. With soaring viewership, escalating ticket prices, and evolving ad sales strategies, this period marks a seismic shift in the landscape of women's athletics. Networks and sponsors recognize women’s sports' immense potential, paving the way for continued growth and elevated status within the global sports arena.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Barry's Tickets\nContact Person: Barry\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 1-800-369-5663\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.barrystickets.com/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

Yo necesito cuidar cada centavo, cada centavo', dijo.Mizrachi señaló que en tres meses todo en el Municipio de Panamá va a cambiar porque dará un giro de timón: aquel que quiera trabajar será bienvenido. Añadió que habrá mucho trabajo disponible. 'Quien no trabaje, no cobrará. Si en una empresa privada eso no está permitido, mucho menos debería permitirse en el gobierno'.",

    "text": "Middle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Video above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokesAfter at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic.Stroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group.Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier research has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages.But the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report.Also, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people.Middle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report.In 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group.Experts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.\"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications.\"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\"Stroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors.But it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say.Strokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic.The younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help.\"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",

    "text": "[](/bicyclist-killed-rittenhouse-square-car-crash/) []https://www.phillyvoice.com/adventure-awaits-you-crawford-county-summer-05999-157/ July 18, 2024 The misleadingly named century plant, also known as Agave americana, is at peak bloom for the first time in 22 years at Longwood Gardens. Century plants bloom once every 10 to 25 years, though previously it was believed they only flowered once every 100 years – thus their name. The perennial succulent can be found in Longwood's Silver Garden greenhouse, which houses a number of other succulents at the public botanical gardens located mostly in East Marlborough, Chester County. Though it's currently at peak bloom, meaning it looks its best right now, the flower should stick around until October, horticulturalists predict. \"This is a spectacular bloom and certainly an unusual one for our region. Though a century plant is a staple in our Silver Garden, it might be another 20 years before the next one blooms,\" Longwood spokesperson Jourdan Cole said. The staff at the Longwood Gardens first saw signs during the winter that the century plant's bloom was imminent. The plant had a growth spurt back in February with a single stalk sprouting upwards from it's bushy leaves near the ground. That stem resembled an asparagus, and it grew 5-6 inches each day that month. Longwood workers had to remove a pane of glass from the conservatory roof back in March to allow the century plant to grow taller, and it now stands over 30 feet tall, looming high above the greenhouse. The blooms are green and yellow clusters that look similar to broccoli. Once it's done blooming, plant's flower head will be removed and dried for use in the Longwood's annual Christmas display. Another century plant will replace this one, restarting the cycle with the potential that plant will bloom in a decade or two. Previous century plants have bloomed at Longwood Gardens in 1997 and 2007. Century plants are native to Mexico and the southern United States. Their nectar can be used as a sweetener, and the sweet liquid also can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal, a liquor that can be produced using a number different species of agave plants.",

    "text": "In a world increasingly fragmented by human activity, the launch of the Global Partnership on Ecological Connectivity (GPEC) at the UN wildlife meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, marks a significant step toward bridging the gaps that separate the habitats of migratory species. This initiative, aiming to identify, protect, and connect areas of importance for wildlife mobility, underscores a growing recognition of the critical need to maintain, enhance, and restore ecological pathways for the benefit of migratory species. As these animals traverse vast distances across the globe, their journeys are hindered by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation, posing a substantial threat to their survival and the biodiversity of our planet.\nUniting for Wildlife: The Global Partnership on Ecological Connectivity\nThe formation of the GPEC represents a collaborative effort among nations and organizations to combat the challenges facing migratory species. By pooling resources and expertise, the partnership seeks to safeguard and reconnect fragmented habitats, ensuring safe passage for animals such as birds, mammals, and fish that rely on extensive migration routes. The importance of transboundary cooperation cannot be overstated, as the habitats these creatures depend on often span multiple countries, each with its own policies and practices affecting wildlife conservation. The GPEC's mission is not only to foster ecological connectivity but also to serve as a beacon of international solidarity in the face of environmental adversity.\nChallenges at Home: The Case of the Crown Mountain Coking Coal Project\nAt the heart of British Columbia, environmental groups Sparwood and District Fish and Wildlife Association along with Wildsight are raising the alarm over the proposed Crown Mountain Coking Coal Project. Situated in the Alexander Valley, a vital corridor for carnivores like grizzly bears and wolverines and a wintering ground for elk, the project threatens to disrupt wildlife connectivity and lead to habitat loss. Concerns extend to the potential for water blockage and contamination, with fears of selenium runoff into Grave Creek and waste rock being dumped into Alexander Creek, endangering the habitat of the westslope cutthroat trout, a species already on the brink. Despite assurances from NWP Coal of plans to employ source control and active treatment methods to minimize environmental impact, skepticism remains regarding their effectiveness.\nA Unified Front for Conservation\nThe initiatives undertaken by the GPEC and the opposition by environmental groups to the Crown Mountain Coking Coal Project share a common goal: the preservation of ecological connectivity and biodiversity. These efforts highlight the imperative to address the threats that endanger not only migratory species but also the ecological balance critical to our survival. The collective action demonstrated at both the global and local levels serves as a testament to the power of unity in the face of environmental challenges. As we move forward, the collaboration between countries, organizations, and communities will be key to bridging the gaps that threaten our natural world.\nIn the spirit of ecological stewardship, the work of the Global Partnership on Ecological Connectivity and the vigilant efforts of environmental groups in British Columbia illuminate the path toward a future where wildlife can thrive without barriers. By understanding and addressing the threats to ecological connectivity, we pave the way for a world enriched by biodiversity and resilience. The journey towards this vision is fraught with challenges, but through collaboration and commitment, the goal of a harmoniously connected ecosystem is within our reach.",

    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Californie - Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA), une entreprise de biotechnologie axée sur le développement de traitements pour les maladies cardiaques, a annoncé des mises à jour concernant son essai clinique en cours MyPEAK-1 de phase 1b/2 pour le TN-201. Cette thérapie génique est en cours d'investigation pour le traitement potentiel de la cardiomyopathie hypertrophique (CMH) associée à MYBPC3.\nLe comité indépendant de surveillance des données et de la sécurité (DSMB) a approuvé la poursuite de l'essai, recommandant une augmentation de la dose et un élargissement des critères d'éligibilité. L'essai a terminé le dosage de sa première cohorte avec une dose de 3E13 vg/kg, montrant un profil de tolérance cohérent avec d'autres thérapies géniques à cette dose et sans réactions indésirables inattendues. Suite à cela, le DSMB a approuvé l'augmentation de la dose à 6E13 vg/kg, et le recrutement pour la deuxième cohorte est en cours.\nL'étude MyPEAK-1 vise à établir le profil de sécurité du TN-201 et à explorer son potentiel dans le traitement de différentes populations en augmentant les niveaux de protéine MyBP-C, qui est déficiente chez les patients atteints de CMH associée à MYBPC3. Le protocole de l'essai a été ajusté pour inclure une biopsie de référence, élargir l'éligibilité pour inclure les patients atteints de CMH obstructive, et augmenter la taille de l'étude, pouvant potentiellement atteindre 24 participants adultes.\nLes données initiales de la première cohorte devraient être rapportées en décembre 2024, se concentrant sur la sécurité, la tolérance, les analyses de biopsie cardiaque et les changements dans les biomarqueurs cardiaques par rapport à la ligne de base. L'essai recueille également des données sur les effets du TN-201 sur les biomarqueurs d'imagerie, la fonction cardiaque, la capacité d'exercice, l'état fonctionnel et la qualité de vie des patients.\nDe plus, Tenaya a partagé des informations sur le fardeau de la maladie de la CMH associée à MYBPC3 chez les enfants. Les données présentées lors des sessions scientifiques de la HCM Society ont révélé que sur près de 1.800 individus atteints de cette condition dans la base de données SHaRe, 13% ont été diagnostiqués avant l'âge de 18 ans, avec 50% connaissant une morbidité significative à l'âge de 40 ans. Cela souligne le besoin de nouveaux médicaments génétiques pouvant avoir un impact significatif sur les résultats.\nLe TN-201 de Tenaya a reçu les désignations Fast Track, Orphan Drug et Rare Pediatric Drug de la Food and Drug Administration américaine, ainsi que la désignation de médicament orphelin de la Commission européenne. L'entreprise continue d'étudier la CMH pédiatrique associée à MYBPC3 à travers l'étude d'histoire naturelle MyClimb.\nCe rapport est basé sur un communiqué de presse de Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc.\nDans d'autres nouvelles récentes, Tenaya Therapeutics a réalisé des progrès significatifs avec son programme de thérapie génique. Canaccord Genuity a maintenu une recommandation d'achat sur les actions de l'entreprise, se concentrant sur la prochaine lecture de données cliniques pour le programme principal de thérapie génique de Tenaya, TN-201. Les données, attendues au quatrième trimestre 2024, fourniront une indication précoce de l'efficacité et de la sécurité de la thérapie. Cela marque la transition de Tenaya vers une entité en phase clinique, avec le potentiel d'influencer significativement la valorisation de l'entreprise.\nEn plus de ces développements, Tenaya a connu des changements majeurs dans la composition de son conseil d'administration et l'introduction d'un nouveau plan d'incitation en actions 2024. Le plan permet l'émission de 1.200.000 actions ordinaires, visant à attirer de nouveaux employés ou dans le cadre d'accords de fusion et d'acquisition. L'entreprise a également annoncé le départ prochain de Leone Patterson, son directeur financier et commercial, déclenchant une recherche pour un nouveau CFO.\nDes analystes de William Blair et Canaccord Genuity ont donné leur avis sur Tenaya, le premier initiant une couverture avec une recommandation Surperformance et le second maintenant une recommandation d'achat. Enfin, H.C. Wainwright a maintenu une recommandation d'achat sur Tenaya, reflétant l'optimisme quant aux progrès de l'entreprise dans le développement de traitements pour la cardiomyopathie hypertrophique. Ce sont les développements récents qui façonnent la trajectoire de Tenaya Therapeutics.\nPerspectives InvestingPro\nAlors que Tenaya Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TNYA) fait progresser ses essais cliniques pour le TN-201, les investisseurs devraient prendre en compte la position financière et la performance de marché de l'entreprise. Selon les données d'InvestingPro, Tenaya a une capitalisation boursière de 168,03 millions €, reflétant son statut d'entreprise de biotechnologie à petite capitalisation axée sur le développement de nouveaux traitements pour les maladies cardiaques.\nLes conseils InvestingPro soulignent que Tenaya \"détient plus de liquidités que de dettes dans son bilan\" et que \"les actifs liquides dépassent les obligations à court terme\". Ces facteurs sont cruciaux pour une entreprise de biotechnologie en phase clinique, car ils offrent une flexibilité financière pour continuer à financer les efforts de recherche et développement, y compris l'essai clinique MyPEAK-1 de phase 1b/2 en cours.\nCependant, il est important de noter que Tenaya \"brûle rapidement ses liquidités\" et \"n'est pas rentable au cours des douze derniers mois\", avec un résultat d'exploitation de -126,95 millions € au cours des douze derniers mois jusqu'au deuxième trimestre 2024. Cela est typique pour les entreprises de biotechnologie en phase précoce qui investissent massivement dans les essais cliniques et le développement de médicaments.\nLa performance récente de l'action a été difficile, avec un rendement total du prix de -51,92% au cours des trois derniers mois. Cette volatilité se reflète dans un autre conseil InvestingPro, qui note que \"les mouvements du prix de l'action sont assez volatils\". Les investisseurs doivent être conscients que les actions de biotechnologie connaissent souvent des fluctuations de prix significatives, en particulier autour des mises à jour des essais cliniques et des décisions réglementaires.\nPour ceux intéressés par une analyse plus approfondie, InvestingPro offre 11 conseils supplémentaires pour Tenaya Therapeutics, fournissant une vue plus complète de la santé financière et de la position sur le marché de l'entreprise.\nCet article a été généré et traduit avec l'aide de l'IA et revu par un rédacteur.
