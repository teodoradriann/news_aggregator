    "text": "Asistieron, entre otros, representantes civiles y militares de Sudáfrica, Rusia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Venezuela y Nicaragua.\nEn la ocasión, el Primer Coronel de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias y agregado militar de Cuba ante Pretoria, Josué Ortega, rememoró cómo desde el principio de la Revolución cubana en 1959, Estados Unidos inició su agresión contra el pueblo de la isla.\nPara ello, recordó, emplearon bandas terroristas, sabotajes, actos de subversión contra la economía y la población, acciones que desembocaron en la invasión, detalló.\nÉsta fue derrotada por el pueblo armado bajo la dirección de Fidel Castro, resaltó Ortega, pues en ese momento Cuba aun carecía de un ejército regular.\nEn esas circunstancias, añadió, la victoria se alcanzó de la mano de los combatientes del Ejército Rebelde y las recién creadas milicias nacionales revolucionarias, luchando en muchos casos con armas que aún no sabían manejar bien.\nLa Victoria de Playa Girón demostró esa idea de Fidel Castro de que cuando un pueblo se decide a luchar y es consciente de sus fuerzas, es invencible.\nEsa enseñanza, múltiples veces repetida en la historia contemporánea, resaltó el agregado militar cubano, es la que acompaña hoy a los pueblos de todo el planeta en su batalla por un mundo mejor.\nFue, asimismo, concluyó, la idea que enarboló el pueblo sudafricano para derrotar al régimen del apartheid, lo que condujo a que este año se celebren los 30 años de libertad en Sudáfrica.\nlam/mv",

    "text": "- May Patterson Writer and Teacher - Updated May 31, 2024 July 15, 2022: The last call my 87-year-old Daddy made was to my niece. “The woods are so beautiful today,” Daddy said. “I’ve been riding my ATV on trails all afternoon, thanking God for giving me eyes to see.” That was Daddy’s last conversation. Ever. Later that night, Daddy failed to show up for my sister’s surprise birthday party. It was unlike him to ever be late, much less not to come at all. Before long, we realized he’d never made it home. Soon, search parties formed and fanned out across his dark, rugged property with spotlights. I waited at home with my mother. Minutes turned into hours. With each chime of the grandfather clock, my heart felt heavier. Mama kept texting Daddy and leaving him voicemails. Somehow, I knew he’d never get those messages, but I kept telling myself he was okay. After all, Daddy was always okay. Finally, I heard a truck pull up in the drive. We ran to the door to see if it was Dad, but it was my husband instead. His face was ashen. He gathered Mama and me up in his arms, and we sank to our knees. He said, “There’s been an accident. He’s gone.” A long chapter of my life suddenly snapped closed. You only have one Dad in this life, and now, mine was gone. A strange, painful realization came over me: I was now fatherless. It felt awful. Perhaps you’ve experienced the same feeling, too. Maybe you just lost your father. Or perhaps you never knew him. Or you might simply feel fatherless due to a troubled relationship. If so, I understand. And if you’re like me, Father’s Day can be hard. But I’ve learned something. Although my earthly father is gone, I can still celebrate Father’s Day with my Heavenly Father. And so can you. Let me help by praying for you and with you. Here are five prayers for the fatherless on Father’s Day: Photo credit: ©SWN/Image created using DALL.E 2024 AI technology - 1. For Those Whose Grief Is FreshSlide 1 of 5 Right after Daddy’s accident, I felt pretty raw inside. Grief came in waves at the strangest, most unpredictable times. I learned that’s how grief is. But I also learned how God can comfort and strengthen you. Five days after my Father’s death, God enabled me to do something I thought was impossible. I spoke at his funeral and read my poem, So God Made a Father, to a huge crowd—without crying. Only God could’ve enabled me to do such a difficult thing. I learned firsthand that this verse is true: “Don’t be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.” ( Is. 41:10 NLT) Let’s pray together: Dear God, For the daughter who feels waves of grief crashing around her: be her anchor. ( Heb. 6:19 ) For the son who doesn’t know how to navigate the loss of his father: be his teacher. ( Ps. 32:8 ) For the child whose cheeks are scored with mournful tears: be her comforter. ( 2 Cor. 1:3 ) For the teen whose heart is raw and aching with grief: be his healer. ( Ps. 147:3 ) For the one who feels fragile right now: be their strength. ( Ps. 73:26 ) For those who fear the future without their Dad: be their hope. ( 1 Pet. 1:3 ) For those who have lost so much: be their victory this Father’s Day, for the battle is already won. ( 1 Cor. 15:57 ) Thank you, Father. You provide all that we need! In Jesus ’s name, amen.Photo credit: ©GettyImages/bernardbodo - 2. For Those Who Never Knew Their DadSlide 2 of 5 If you never knew your father, my heart goes out to you. It must have been very difficult for you to grow up without him. This Father’s Day, please find hope in this verse: “I will be your God throughout your lifetime—until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. I will carry you along and save you.” ( Is. 46:4 NLT) Dear Lord, I pray for those who never knew their father. That kind of pain is difficult to overcome because it spans a lifetime. Father’s Day can remind them of what they never had. While others celebrate, they often feel alone. Not having a Dad leaves an empty place in the heart—fill the empty space with your love. May it overflow! Lord, please be the loving father they never knew, for you are a father to the fatherless and a defender of widows ( Ps. 68:5 ). Hold them by the hand this Father’s Day ( Is. 41:13 ). Love them as tenderly as you would love a child. Be their teacher. Lead them along the best path ( Ps. 32:8 ). If they stray, gently lead them back to it ( Ps. 23:4 ). Watch over them daily. For your perfect love lasts not only for a lifetime but forever and ever. This Father’s Day, we celebrate you—our perfect Father. Amen! Photo Credit: ©iStock/Getty Images Plus/Choreograph - 3. For Those Who Dread Father’s DaySlide 3 of 5 Last year, I dreaded my first Father’s Day without my Dad. Deciding beforehand to make it a day of gratitude really helped me get through it. If you’re dreading Father’s Day this year, I hope you will find comfort in this verse: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .” (Phil 4:6-7) Dear Lord God Almighty, I pray for those who dread Father’s Day this year. Please make this Father’s Day different. I pray that for just ONE day, you will make: Our memories golden, laden with gratitude. Our sighs only from contentment, for you satisfy our need. Our only bewilderment be because of your grace. All of our tears, grateful tears, for our many blessings. Each shrug only because we know we don’t deserve your love. Fill the empty place in our hearts with your Spirit. Fill the empty space at our tables with someone new to love. And fill the empty holiday with joy, as only you can. In Jesus’s Name, amen.Photo credit: ©GettyImages/Drazen Zigic - 4. For Those Who Feel Fatherless Due to a Painful RelationshipSlide 4 of 5 While Dad and I loved each other, we had a far-from-perfect relationship (especially when I was younger). Maybe you can relate. Relational struggles—especially with your father—can alter your perception of God’s love. In order to grasp God’s love better, you must feed on it daily. David paints the most beautiful picture of God as our loving Father on the canvas of Psalm 139 : 1-10 (GNT). As you read each line, pause and praise God with me for the glorious way He loves us. Dear Lord, You know everything I do; from far away, you understand all my thoughts. I praise you for taking such a personal interest in me. You see me, whether I am working or resting; you know all my actions. I praise you for watching over me. Even before I speak, you already know what I will say. I praise you for listening to me. You are all around me on every side; you protect me with your power. I praise you for your protection. Your knowledge of me is too deep; it is beyond my understanding. I praise you for your greatness. Where could I go to escape from you? Where could I get away from your presence? If I went up to heaven, you would be there; if I lay down in the world of the dead, you would be there. If I flew away beyond the East or lived in the farthest place in the West, you would be there to lead me; you would be there to help me. I praise you for your constant presence in my life. All of the flaws of our earthly fathers are made right in you, heavenly Father. May we live every day like it’s Father’s Day by honoring and celebrating YOU. Amen.Photo credit: ©GettyImages/milan2099 - 5. For Those Who Want to Celebrate Father’s DaySlide 5 of 5 Even if you’re fatherless, you still have many Father’s Day options. You can spend some time being grateful for your own father. You can send a card to other fathers who you love or admire. You can encourage new fathers. You can visit an aging father. Perhaps you can use this verse to inspire others: “As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.” ( Ps. 103:13 ) Dear Lord, We pray that our fathers who have passed into the next life have been welcomed into your loving arms. We praise you that our family will one day be reunited in your heavenly kingdom. What a joyous day that will be! Thank you for the promise of seeing our fathers again. Lord, even if our fathers did not live up to your plan for their lives, help us to speak kindly of them. Give us the grace to forgive them, as you also forgive us. Help us not to hold on to bitterness and anger. Teach us how to be better parents and friends as a result of our experience. Help us accept that the past cannot be changed; enable us to let it go and move forward. Thank you for those who served as loving father figures in our lives. May their love and selflessness be returned to them. Help them to know that their influence has truly blessed us. Bless new fathers with the guidance they need to raise happy and holy children grounded in love for God and others. Teach these fathers how to love and respect their wives, which will be a great gift to their children. In the name of Christ, amen. Although I lost my father almost two years ago, I’ve learned that I am not fatherless. If you’re a child of God, you are not fatherless, either. This Father’s Day, let’s refuse to wear that label because we belong to God the Father through faith in Christ. We’ve been given His powerful name to wear ( Rev. 3:12 ), and we are His heirs ( Rom. 8:17 ). We have a place at His very own table ( Eph. 2:6 ) and a place in His family. But here’s the best part: our Heavenly Father can never be taken away from us. He will be our loving Father, forever and ever ( Jn. 10:28 ).

    "text": "UBTech Robotics, China’s biggest manufacturer of educational and humanoid robots, climbed on the first day of trading in Hong Kong, after raising HK$1 billion (US$130 million) of proceeds in the city’s final initial public offering (IPO) of the year.\\nThe stock gained 0.1 per cent to HK$90.10 at 2pm local time on Friday, versus its IPO price of HK$90, giving the Shenzhen-based company trading under 9880 code a HK$37.6 billion market capitalisation. The Hang Seng Index was little changed, holding at a four-week high on Thursday.\\nZhou Jian, the 47-year old founder and CEO of UBTech, and the firm’s Walker S humanoid service robot, struck the listing gong to mark the occasion. Zhou’s direct 24.8 per cent stake in the firm would be worth about US$1.2 billion at current market price. Tencent, the WeChat operator, has a 6.3 per cent stake.\\n\\n“Since the founding of the company, UBTech always keeps in mind the mission of having robots in every household,” Zhou said at the listing event. “After the IPO, the company will continue to deliver its promise [and] deepen its research on robotics.”\\nThe debut lit some sparks in a gloomy year for Hong Kong’s stock market. The number of IPOs fell by about a tenth, according to Refinitiv data. Proceeds collected from investors declined 54 per cent to a 20-year low of HK$46 billion.\\nMore than US$520 billion billion of market value has evaporated across the Hong Kong stock exchange this year, according to Bloomberg data. The Hang Seng Index tumbled 15 per cent in an unprecedented four-year losing streak. Its top three losers, Li Ning, Country Garden Services and Zhongsheng Group, plunged by 53 per cent to 69 per cent as of December 28.\\nCainiao, Midea, SF and Movoi among hotly anticipated Hong Kong IPOs of 2024\\nUBTech sold 11.3 million new shares to investors in Hong Kong and globally, pricing the offering at the lower end of its target range of HK$86 to HK$116, according to a stock exchange filing on Thursday. The IPO generated 5.2 times from Hong Kong investors and 2.2 times from global funds.\\nUBTech, known for its toy Star Wars stormtrooper robots, filed its stock offering in February. It has a 23 per cent share of China’s educational robot market, which contributed 77 per cent to its annual sales in the past three years. It also builds advanced humanoid robots targeting the healthcare sector.\\nChina’s service robot market is forecast to grow at an annual compound rate of 24 per cent to 183.2 billion yuan (US$25.6 billion) by 2028, outpacing the 18 per cent growth rate globally, according to a report by Frost & Sullivan published in the IPO prospectus.\\nGuotai Junan Securities was the sole sponsor and global coordinator of the IPO. Citic Securities, CMBC Capital, Huatai Securities, BNP Paribas and Shenwan Hongyuan also joined as global coordinators.\\nAdditional reporting by Li Jiaxing\\n",
