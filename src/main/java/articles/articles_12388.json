    "title": "A 'planetary alignment' peaks this week | Here's how to see it",
    "text": "TEMPLE, Texas — For the second time this year, skywatchers can catch a unique sight in the night sky, a planetary alignment.\nSeven planets are visible in the sky through the month of February, five to the naked eye. The event is expected to peak, with two of the planets being the closest together, on Monday, Feb. 24, according to Space.com.\nVenus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Saturn will all be visible in the sky this month. Uranus and Neptune can also be spotted, though stargazers will likely need a telescope or a good pair of binoculars to be able to find them.\nBoth Space.com and NASA agree that planetary alignments to some degree are not overly rare, with two or three planets being visible relatively often, however, five to seven planets being visible is still a special sight. This alignment is actually the second time multiple planets have aligned this year, with another \"planetary parade\" having taken place in January.\nTo see the alignment, Space.com recommends looking for planets around dusk. Venus will reportedly be the most prominent of the planets, being the brightest of the seven. It can be spotted in the west-southwest sky at dusk throughout the month, according to Space.com.\nStarting from Venus, trace a line straight down to find Saturn. The first \"bright, star-like object\" will be the famous ringed planet. Space.com says Saturn will not be as bright as it usually is due to the position of its rings in comparison to Earth, but those with a good telescope may be able to see the rings as a line down the center of the planet.\nJupiter will reportedly be significantly dimmer than Venus, but can still be seen high in the south at dusk as a silvery-white light. Those with telescopes or binoculars may even be able to spot some of its moons!\nHalfway up in the eastern part of the sky will be Mars, said Space.com, accompanied by the stars Castor and Pollux, forming a triangle.\nLastly, Mercury will be visible just to the right of Saturn, according to Space.com. On Feb. 24, the planets will reach their closest points to one another in the sky, being just 1.5 degrees apart. Mercury will reportedly shine about eight times brighter than Saturn.\nUranus and Neptune, the furthest planets from Earth, will need a telescope or binoculars to see, but those with the right equipment can add them to the lineup of visible planets as well.\nFor more information on exactly where to look for each planet and when, visit Space.com or EarthSky.\nDue to their orbit around the sun, or \"ecliptic\", the planets will always be visible in a relative line in the sky, according to NASA. However, it is still a rare sight for all five visible planets and the two non-visible ones to be aligned in a way for stargazers to see them all at once.\nFor more information on planetary alignments, visit NASA's website at this link.",

    "text": "Crew treated well by Iranian authorities, says Kerala woman released from seized ship Indian deck cadet Ann Tessa Joseph, one of the 17 Indian crew onboard the Israeli ship seized by Iran, said that the Iranian authorities treated the crew well. Listen to Story In Short - Crew of seized ship treated well by Iranian authorities, says Ann Joseph - Joseph reached home in Kottayam on Thursday - Ann Joseph was among 17 Indians on Israeli ship seized by Iran Indian deck cadet Ann Tessa Joseph, a crew member of the Israeli-flagged merchant ship seized by Iran, who was released by Iranian authorities and reached her home in Kottayam in Kerala, said that the Iranian authorities treated the crew really well. Speaking to reporters [after reaching her home on Thursday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-woman-ship-seized-iran-returns-home-government-working-to-rescue-remaining-crew-members-2528799-2024-04-18), she said, \"Even though they (Iranian authorities) seized the ship, they treated the crew really well. Food was not an issue. We used to eat and then return to the cabin. They didn't have any intention to harm the crew.\" Ann Joseph, 25, is among the [17 Indian nationals who were onboard the container vessel MSC Aries](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/indians-onboard-israel-linked-ship-seized-by-iran-report-2526838-2024-04-13) when it was seized by the Iranian military near the Strait of Hormuz last week. She said that the Iranian authorities also made arrangements for the sailors to communicate with their respective families, according to news agency PTI. \"I was released early probably as I was the only woman onboard the ship,\" Joseph said. She expressed gratitude to everyone, including the External Affairs Ministry, who helped in her release. Ann Joseph said that everyone onboard the ship was aware of the tensions between Israel and Iran, but never expected that such a thing would happen to them. She further said that the consulate had told her that the remaining 16 Indians, including three from Kerala, would be released soon. Apart from Ann Tessa, the other crew from Kerala include, second officer PV Dhanesh, 32, from Mananthavady in Wayanad, second engineer Shyam Nath, 31, from Mavoor in Kozhikode and third engineer S Sumesh, 31, from Keralassery in Palakkad. On being asked if she would return to the field after this incident, she said, \"\"I took up this job because I desired to work in this field. So, I will definitely go back to work in this field.\" [Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi told India Today TV](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/indian-crew-seized-ship-return-weather-calms-down-iran-envoy-to-india-today-tv-2528011-2024-04-16) on Tuesday that all the 17 Indians who were on board the ship were safe. He added that the weather situation in the Persian Gulf is not good and the Indians on the ship will be sent home once the weather clears. Iran seized the Israeli flagged ship on April 13 amid the growing tensions between the two countries after Iran fired over 300 missiles and drones over Israel.",
