South African then brought an application before the ICJ on December 29 alleging violation by Israel of its obligations under the Genocide Convention in relation to Palestinians in Gaza.\nKahn said every loss of life in the conflict between Israel and Hamas was tragic.\n“Over the past seven months of this heartbreaking war, it has become increasingly obvious that peace needs to be made through political negotiations and not legal institutions,” Kahn said.\nShe said this was because the ICJ had no jurisdiction over Hamas.\nKahn said professor emeritus Andre Thomashausen had repeatedly stated that “thus far, with all its cases, South Africa has not saved one life”.\nIn its many statements, interviews and speeches, the South African government had made against Israel, it had not once commented on the bodies of Israeli hostages that had been reportedly found in Gaza, including three in Rafah in the past week, Kahn said.\n“Neither have they acknowledged or condemned Hamas footage also found in Rafah this week, showing sexual threats by Hamas against young Israeli women captives.”\nShe said South Africa had forever tainted itself in its willingness to overlook the horrendous crimes of Hamas, damaging its reputation as an honest peace broker.\nTimesLIVE",

    "title": "Manito United Methodist Church celebrates 100 years - Sun, 02 Jun 2024 PST",
    "text": "Every day, hundreds of motorists pass a unique piece of Spokane history on the corner of Grand Boulevard and 33rd Avenue. Designed by Kirtland Cutter, Manito United Methodist Church has stood as a quiet beacon of welcome for 100 years. On June 9, the church will celebrate its centennial with an Open House and tour. “It’s the only remaining, intact, Kirtland Cutter-designed church in Spokane,” congregation member Wendy Budge said. In 1910, Manito Methodist Episcopal Church was built at 502 E. 33rd Ave., and by 1921, the congregation had outgrown the small space. “Spokane businessman Seymour Birch and his wife Mary donated three lots and $30,000 to fund the building of the (new) church,” Budge said. “He wanted the church to be built in the Italian Renaissance style like the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi.” Architect Cutter captured Birch’s vision, but neither Birch nor his wife Mary lived to see the building completed in 1924. The three-story church featured a gym with a basketball court that extended from a sub-basement through the ceiling of the street level. A south-facing large rose window was dedicated to Mary Birch. The building is an unusual blend of Italian Renaissance and midcentury modern design, because in 1959, the education wing, designed by prominent Inland Northwest architect George Rasque was added. At the time of the addition, a sanctuary was planned, which would have destroyed Cutter’s original design. “Fate and the John Birch Society stepped in at that point,” Budge said. In the early 1960s, the far-right John Birch Society suspected communists were lurking everywhere – including the Methodist church. Manito United Methodist member Lucy Thosath, now deceased, wrote of the conflict. “Emotions ran high, and a large group left the Methodist Church and Manito, breaking longtime friendships and leaving painful wounds, as well as playing havoc with our budget.” That division spared the 1924 structure from the wrecking ball. “Lacking funds, the new sanctuary was never erected, and we still have Kirtland Cutter’s creation,” Budge said. In 2016, both the church and its education wing were placed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places. Thirty-three stained glass windows surround the sanctuary and adjoining areas, most of them dedicated to the memory of past parishioners and pastors. The huge, heavy pocket doors on either side of the sanctuary were preserved, as well as the original wooden pews and lecterns. Seymour Birch intended the sacred space to be of service to the community. Rev. Sandy Ward said with three preschools and 14 recovery groups meeting at the church, as well as Boy Scouts and other community groups, the church is living out that mission. Like many churches, Manito United Methodist lost members during COVID, and the congregation is aging, but Ward said they’ve found a way to include younger folks in their services. “Our music director, Dr. Jadrian Tarver, is a professor at Gonzaga University,” she said. “He created a student music program. The students sing in the choir, and it adds a youthful presence.” While mindful of keeping the historic integrity of the building intact, work is scheduled outside to improve the landscape. “We’re recreating ‘God’s Corner,’ a Spokane-scaping of our front and side lawns to be environmentally responsible and bring attention to creation care and climate justice,” Ward said. She hopes Manito United Methodist will continue its mission into the next 100 years. “The vision I have for this church is that it’s a place where people can become whole and holy,” Ward said. “It’s a place where they can find safety, healing and support.” Budge believes Seymour Birch would be pleased. “Birch wanted this to be a church for the community,” Budge said. “One hundred years later, the church is still fulfilling his dream.” Contact Cindy Hval at dchval@juno.com.",

    "text": "Mega construcciones sostenibles, soluciones innovadoras como un concreto que habla o fotoluminiscente llegaron a la conversación en la Feria Internacional del Libro de Monterrey (FILMTY) 2024 con la presentación del panel “Las Ciudades del Futuro”, organizado por la empresa Cemex.\nLa mesa contó con la participación de Feniosky Peña-Mora, Presidente Electo de la ASCE (Sociedad Americana de Ingenieros Civiles), Vicepresidente Ejecutivo de Investigación y Decano de Ingeniería y Ciencias del Tecnológico de Monterrey, además de Yuri de los Santos, Vicepresidente del Segmento Constructores de Cemex México, quienes hablaron sobre los avances sostenibles para la humanidad.\nDurante el panel se abordaron las principales tendencias que conformarán el futuro de las diferentes sociedades, atendiendo necesidades como la urbanización organizada, el cambio climático y el cuidado ambiental, pero también avances en soluciones de la construcción que ya son una realidad.\nEjemplo de estos proyectos futuristas es la impresora de concreto 3D que Cemex introdujo a México en 2023, con tecnología que permite utilizar la cantidad exacta de material para levantar una construcción, reduciendo hasta en 60% los residuos en el lugar de la obra.\nTambién destaca la elaboración de un concreto que brilla en la oscuridad, tras la absorción de la luz solar y eléctrica o un concreto que habla y que permite interactuar gracias a la programación.\n“En Cemex pasamos de vender productos a vender soluciones. Cada vez que pensamos en un producto, pensamos en qué le vamos a resolver a la sociedad y, cuando uno pone ese tipo de mentalidad, lo que generas son productos que se salen de lo tradicional, que realmente rompan paradigmas y que generen un cambio drástico en la industria de la construcción”, aseguró Yuri de los Santos.\nLos esfuerzos en sostenibilidad de la compañía se alinean con Futuro en Acción, su programa para lograr la excelencia sostenible a través de la acción climática, circularidad y gestión de los recursos naturales, con el objetivo de convertirse en una empresa de cero emisiones netas de CO2 para 2050.\nEn la charla se proyectó el tráiler del documental “Ciudades del Futuro”, producido por MacGillivray Freeman Films y la ASCE e impulsada por Cemex en México, que encabeza la nueva era de la edificación sostenible en el país.\n“Cuando pensamos en Ciudades del Futuro pensemos en ciudades que realmente sean de mucha equidad e inclusión. Tenemos que asegurarnos de que tengamos la juventud preparada y entusiasmada para ese futuro”, manifestó Feniosky Peña-Mora.\nEl panel contó con la presencia de autoridades de la FILMTY, como la presidenta Carmen Junco y Judith Ruiz Godoy, Decana Nacional de la Escuela de Humanidades y Educación del Tec de Monterrey, así como niños y jóvenes, quienes también pudieron interactuar con un stand de Cemex en el evento, soñando con las ciudades del futuro.",

    "title": "IDF contends with threats in northern Gaza",
    "text": "Israel Defense Forces eliminated fifteen Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza, the IDF said on January 31. In addition, two IDF soldiers — one of them\nfrom the elite air force Shaldag unit and the other from the 14th reserve brigade — were killed in northern Gaza. The IDF’s continued raids against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure in northern Gaza comes as Israel seeks to isolate the last remaining pockets of Hamas fighters in Khan Younis. The challenges in northern Gaza also illustrate that two months after the area was largely cleared of Hamas, the threats continue.\nAccording to the IDF, operations continue in northern Gaza and the central Gaza strip. “In a significant targeted raid on terrorist infrastructure embedded inside a school in the area, approximately 10 Islamic Jihad terrorist operatives, who were using the school as a hideout, were apprehended by IDF troops. In addition, the troops located and destroyed five ready-to-fire rockets in the area,” the IDF said on January 31.\nIn addition, there were clashes in Shati Camp in northern Gaza. Shati refers to the area of the neighborhood which is next to the beach. It’s also built on a refugee camp established in the 1950s. As such, it is a warren of small streets and a heavily built-up area. The camp has been a stronghold of Hamas and other terrorist groups for many years. According to the IDF on January 31, a number of armed terrorists were spotted on the outskirts of Shati. “The troops conducted searches of military sites in the area in which they located large quantities of weapons, as well as documents and military equipment belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization,” the IDF said.\nThere are concerns about Hamas returning to northern Gaza. The Guardian\nreported on January 30 that “Hamas militants have returned to northern Gaza, where they are mobilising against Israeli forces and rebuilding a system of governance, aid officials, residents, analysts.” Most of northern Gaza was evacuated during the first two months of the war after October 7. However, an estimated 250,000 or more people remained in the north. The presence of Hamas among those civilians is difficult to quantify. However, the IDF’s continued work dismantling the terrorist infrastructure is a long-term process that requires time in the north and center of the strip. For instance on January 31, the IDF said that “in the northern Gaza Strip, IDF troops are continuing to enter Hamas military compounds and eliminate terrorists.”\nIn southern Gaza on February 1, the IDF identified a long-range missile launcher. It was struck by an aircraft. “Over the past day, the troops eliminated dozens of terrorists. Following the identification of a terrorist cell in central Gaza, IDF troops directed an aircraft that struck and eliminated a number of terrorists in the area,” the IDF said.\nIsrael is operating more in western Khan Younis, as well. This puts Israeli forces near the humanitarian area in Gaza called Mawasi. That is the area where many Gazans from the north fled in October and November. Israeli forces are now operating across the Gaza strip from east to west, essentially cutting off Rafah near the Egyptian border with central Gaza and the north. The only conduit for Hamas to move between these areas would likely be via the humanitarian area. This presents challenges as well, because the IDF does not want to operate in a densely packed area full of internally displaced people and is hesitant about operations near Rafah due to Egyptian concerns.\nOn January 31, the IDF said that it was continuing “extensive” activities in western Khan Younis. “Over the past day, IDF troops eliminated terrorists in the area in close-quarters combat. In addition, IDF troops directed several aircraft that struck and eliminated a number of terrorists in different areas.” The operations in Khan Younis have been like this for weeks, with daily airstrikes and a much lower intensity type of fighting than in the operations of November and December.",

    "text": "2024 PARIS SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES Pool Swimming: July 27 – August 4, 2024 Open Water Swimming: August 8 – 9, 2024 La Défense Arena — Paris, France LCM (50 meters) Meet Central Full Schedule SwimSwam Preview Index Entry Lists One of the top stories regarding the Chinese swimming team heading into Paris is the fact that 11 of the 23 who tested positive for banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ) ahead of the 2020 Olympics are among the lineup for these Games.\nAlthough the nation’s roster of 31 athletes has already been drug tested almost 200 times in total after just its first 10 days in Paris, Chinese swimmers may not receive an overwhelmingly cheerful response upon earning a medal.\nFor instance, reigning 200m breaststroke Olympic champion Zac Stubblety-Cook told Reuters this week that he may consider a podium protest or other display of disapproval should current world record holder Qin Haiyang of China earn a medal.\n“Personally I think I will make a decision [about a protest of some kind] probably on the day.\n“Racing someone that was one of those athletes and finding out he was one of those athletes was disappointing.\n“I think it’s less about what country they came from and more about the system and how the system ultimately feels like it’s failed. And that’s the truth.”\nAs we reported earlier this year, the International Olympic Committee’s ( IOC ) Rule 50 , which governs athlete expression, maintains for Paris that athletes are still not allowed to make signs of protest or expression during official ceremonies like medal ceremonies.\nZSC acknowledged this fact, stating, “Everyone probably is aware of rule 50 here and the repercussions that happen with that.”\nIt was at the 2019 World Championships where now-retired Aussie medalist Mack Horton protested gold medalist Sun Yang ‘s (CHN) presence by abstaining from podium celebrations, standing behind the platform on the floor during the Chinese national anthem.\nHorton and the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) received warning letters from World Aquatics (then FINA) for the demonstration.\nAnother Olympic champion breaststroker, Adam Peaty of Great Britain, has also commented on the current state of Chinese doping case affairs. He said this week, “If it’s not fair then it takes the enjoyment out for me.\n“I think if other countries aren’t living up to that standard [high standard that British athletes are], then it’s a real shame that brings a real dark cloud over what the Olympics is meant to stand for.” (Reuters)",
