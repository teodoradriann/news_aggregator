    "title": "Indian court orders zoo to change ‘blasphemous’ names of cohabiting lions",
    "text": "GettyImages-1238137960 (1).jpg\nAn Indian court has asked a zoo in West Bengal to rename two lions after a hardline right-wing Hindu organisation claimed that one of the names offended the religious sentiments of Hindus.\nThe two were named Sita and Akbar and they were living together in the same enclosure in the zoo.\nIn Hindu mythology, Sita is worshipped along with Lord Ram. And in Islam, Akbar is one of the 100 names of god [Allah]. A Muslim ruler during the Mughal era in India was also named Akbar.\nThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad [VHP] complained that the lioness should not be named after the Hindu deity, Sita.\nOn Thursday, a court in West Bengal said that animals should not be named after “Hindu gods, Muslim Prophets, Christian figures, Nobel laureates and freedom fighters”.\n“You could have named it Bijli [lightning] or something like that. But why give names such as Akbar and Sita?” Justice Saugata Bhattacharya asked.\nThe court also questioned the zoo authorities’ wisdom of naming pets, dogs included, after humans. “You could’ve avoided a controversy,” the judge said.\nThe two lions currently live at the North Bengal Wild Animals Park in Siliguri, West Bengal.\nThe VHP also opposed the idea of both animals sharing the same park.\n“Sita and Akbar cannot be allowed to live together,” VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said.\nThe VHP, affiliated with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP], criticised the naming as a direct attack on Hindu beliefs, accusing West Bengal’s opposition-ruled government of intentional provocation and threatening protests if the names and location of the lions were not changed.\n“She [Sita] is the consort of [Hindu god] Lord Ram and herself is a sacred deity to all Hindus across the world,” VHP said in its complaint. “Such an act amounts to blasphemy and is a direct assault on the religious beliefs of all Hindus.”\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "Former apprentice becomes production manager at the company where he started at 16 A loyal employee has been promoted to production manager at Stairways Midlands, almost three decades on from starting out there as a teenager. [John Corser](/news/authors/john-corser/) Andy Clarke, 44, joined Stairways Midlands, one of the UK’s largest manufacturers of volume staircases and door solutions, as a carpentry and joinery apprentice at just 16. He worked his way up over the past 28 years and has now been made Production Manager at the Walsall factory, where he has spent the majority of his career, after Stairways acquired the factory 20 years ago. The story of his steady climb with one company is, as Andy describes, “something you don’t think happens anymore”, but he counts himself fortunate to have remained loyal to one company throughout his career. Andy said: “I’ve worked all my life to get into this role. I started from the bottom and progressed through, staying loyal to the same company my whole career – something you think of only happening for people years ago. “It’s a great company to work for, and it has been very good to me. All those years of hard work and loyalty were recognised - it has all paid off.",
