    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France has expelled a Tunisian Muslim cleric for \"radicalism\" and \"unacceptable remarks\", Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on Twitter.\n\"The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory, less than 12 hours after his arrest. We will not let people get away with anything,\" Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nIn an earlier statement, Darmanin said he had given instructions to issue a ministerial deportation order against \"this radical 'imam' with unacceptable remarks\". \"Firmness is the rule,\" he added.\nIn a post that went viral on social media and was widely reported in French media, the imam referred to \"the three-coloured flag\" as \"satanic\".\nMahjoubi, who preached in the Ettaouba mosque of Bagnols-sur-Ceze, southern France, has denied any wrongdoing. He told French media that his comments had been taken out of context and that he had not meant to disrespect the French flag. The French flag has three colours: blue, white and red.\nHis lawyer told French media he will appeal the expulsion procedure.\nFrench media published excerpts of the expulsion order, which stated that Mahjoubi had \"conveyed a literal, backward, intolerant, and violent conception of Islam, likely to encourage behaviors contrary to the values of the Republic, discrimination against women, identity retreat, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization'.\"\nBFM reported that Mahjoubi was being held in administrative detention in the Paris region.\nDarmanin did not specify where the imam had been held nor when, how and where to he was expelled.\nFranceinfo reported that Mahjoubi was on a plane headed to Tunis on Thursday evening.\nDarmanin said that the French government's new immigration law, voted earlier this year, had allowed for the quick expulsion of the imam.\nWith the far-right RN party leading in polls for European elections in June, President Emmanuel Macron is under pressure to be tough on immigration and identity issues.\n(Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Alistair Bell)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Dharamshala (Himachal Pradesh) [India], June 12 (ANI): On the auspicious day of June 11, 2025, the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives (LTWA) honoured the 55th anniversary of its establishment and the laying of its foundation stone, which was graciously blessed by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama in 1970. According to a report by the Central Tibetan Administration, it is one of the most important libraries and institutions for Tibetan literature in exile.\nThe 55th anniversary was attended by the Chief Guest, Sikyong Penpa Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration, and Special Chief Guest Speaker Khenpo Sonam Tenphel. The ceremony began with the Chief Guest and Special Guest lighting the traditional butter lamp, followed by Geshe Lhakdor, the LTWA Director, delivering a welcome address. In his speech, he provided a brief outline of the Library's 55-year history and founding mission, according to CTA.\nAlso Read | Tatkal Ticket Booking New Rules: 3 Major Changes Passengers Must Know for Train Ticket Bookings During Tatkal Hours.\nHe stated that the key goals of LTWA are to serve as a vital source of Tibetan cultural knowledge while also fostering an academic environment that stimulates study and learning among researchers and students. He emphasised that such efforts are especially crucial in today's world, where political and spiritual uncertainty continue to challenge communities around the world, according to the CTA report.\nFormer LTWA employees gave speeches, expressing their personal views, work experiences, and perspectives on the Library's critical role in conserving and promoting Tibetan history. Sikyong provided an account of the LTWA's history and accomplishments in the preservation of Tibetan writings, old manuscripts, artefacts, and other aspects of Tibetan cultural heritage, according to the CTA report.\nAlso Read | 'Operation Sindoor Was Like Kids Playing Video Game on Computer': Maharashtra Congress Leader Nana Patole Sparks Row With Remarks on India's Response to Pahalgam Attack (Video).\nWhen Communist China annexed Tibet in 1959, it put Tibetan culture in grave peril. Many schools, historic manuscripts, artefacts, and other aspects of Tibetan history were taken or destroyed in the name of modernisation. Seeing this serious threat, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama established the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives to conserve, safeguard, and promote Tibetan culture, according to CTA.\nHe further highlighted that when His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama first arrived in exile in India and outside of a foreign country, he did not speak of Tibet's struggle or exile, but rather of human values, empathy, and compassion, which sparked increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism and culture around the world. Foreigners and politicians gradually began to support the Tibetan cause and struggle, CTA reported.\nThe event concluded with closing remarks and a vote of appreciation from Ngawang Yeshi, LTWA's General Secretary, who expressed deep gratitude to all of the Library's guests, former personnel, and supporters. He thanked them for their ongoing support and efforts to safeguard the institution's purpose of preserving Tibetan knowledge and tradition, CTA stated.

    "text": "Ready. Set. Serve.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson turns an even 100 this September, and he has a small favor to ask.\nThe oldest president to ever lead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a call Saturday — a hundred days before his birthday — asking the faith’s members to engage in an act of service between now and his centennial.\n“One spiritual offering that would brighten my life,” he wrote on social media, “is for each of us to reach out to ‘the one’ in our lives who may be feeling lost or alone.”\nThe former heart surgeon didn’t name specific examples or types of service. Instead, drawing on the biblical parable of a shepherd seeking out the one “lost sheep” among a flock of 100, he encouraged members to “consider prayerfully: Who do you know who may be discouraged? Who might you need to reconcile with or ask for forgiveness? Has one name been on your mind lately, though you haven’t quite known why?”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Russell M. Nelson (@russellmnelson)\nNelson promised that “as you bring these questions to the Lord, he will inspire you to know how you can reach out and lift one who needs help.”\nTo complete this task, the church leader has given his flock a head start, issuing his invitation exactly 100 days ahead of his Sept. 9 birthday.\nIf all members faithfully engaged in the project, it would result in more than 17 million acts of service across the globe. Not bad.\nBut then, Nelson’s presidency has been defined by one of nearly constant activity . Sweeping changes to worship services , an unprecedented number of temples entering the construction pipeline and a steady stream of policy changes big and small — each of these and more have come to define the nonagenarian leader as a mover and shaker in the minds of faithful Latter-day Saints.\nThere are signs, however, Nelson’s body has been matching his ambition less and less. His presence at the afternoon Saturday session of the faith’s April General Conference marked the first time in a year that the leader had appeared in person for a portion of the biannual worldwide broadcast.\nLater that month, however, he surprised members in Manti, where he led the rededication of the city’s historic pioneer-era temple .\n(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Russell M. Nelson and wife Wendy participate in the rededication of the Manti Temple on Sunday, April 21, 2024.\nNelson and his counselors — apostles Dallin Oaks and Henry Eyring, both of whom are 91 — comprise the oldest First Presidency in Latter-day Saint history .\nOaks, a former lawyer and longtime friend of Nelson, is next in line to lead the global church.",

    "text": "El pueblo de Santiago de Cuba capturó a un presunto traficante de drogas tras una larga persecución por las calles de la ciudad. El periodista independiente Yosmany Mayeta Labrada compartió en su perfil de Según le relató al reportero una testigo del suceso, la propia Policía le mintió a la población diciendo que el hombre al que perseguían era un ladrón que había arrebatado un teléfono, y luego cambiaron la versión y afirmaron que había robado una cartera; pero nada era cierto. El objetivo era que las personas se unieran y pudieran capturarlo, pues andaba huyendo por las calles del centro de la ciudad y no podían apresarlo. \"El hombre llegó a la calle Santa Rosa y le dijo a un señor que lo ayudara, que la Policía venía detrás de él, pero él hombre no quiso meterse en eso. Él se metió en una cuartería y cerró el portón y de ahí brincó por los techos y salió a la calle Princesa y allí fue donde lo cogió el pueblo\", detalló una residente de la zona. De acuerdo con ese testimonio, por las calles que pasaron se fue sumando la gente hasta que la aglomeración era tal que los policías se metieron en una casa ubicada en Santa Rosa y Corona y -según dicen- \"los policías enseñaron la paca de droga porque el pueblo quería seguir dándole golpes al hombre\". Los agentes se quedaron con el presunto traficante en la vivienda a la espera de que llegara una patrulla. ¿Qué opinas?
