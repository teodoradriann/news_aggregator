    "text": "Comedian Romesh Ranganathan has called for his local council to make its school placement process less stressful for parents.\nMr Ranganathan's appeal to get his youngest son into one of his preferred secondary schools was turned down by West Sussex County Council (WSCC).\nThe TV presenter said: \"Parents are struggling to make ends meet, they've got all sorts of other stresses in their lives, this being more stressful than it needs to, in my opinion, is not acceptable.\"\nWSCC said: \"This year we were able to offer 87% of the 9,050 secondary school applicants a place at their first choice of school, while nearly 97% were offered a place at one of their three preferences.\"\nIn April, the comedian said he had emailed WSCC six times after his son had been placed in a school \"on the other side of town\", and not at the same school as his two older brothers.\nSince talking about his concerns on social media, Mr Ranganathan said he had received messages from families who had been \"messed around\" by councils, \"particularly\" WSCC.\n\"What became clear from people getting in touch is that the system is letting people down and there's people whose kids have been allocated schools that are so far away they don't know how they're going to do the school run,\" he added.\nThe council said it understood the disappointment of parents who were not offered a place at a preferred school but explained that it was sometimes not possible \"due to a number of factors relating to the selection criteria\".\nGetty Images Mr Ranganathan hosts A League of Their Own and a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2 WSCC explained: \"Applications are considered by our admissions team on their priority according to the relevant oversubscription criteria for their preferred schools, which may include proximity of the school to home and whether other siblings attend the same school.\"\nMr Ranganathan is calling on the council to look at the level of provision for children going into education.\nHe says the system \"needs to get sorted out\".\n\"We need to feel like the education of our children is something that is being cared about by the people that are in control of these things.\"\nThe comedian said trying to get your child into education was \"one of the most stressful things\".\nThe comedian says although he understands the system \"can't be perfect for everybody\", he says it can come across \"very faceless and quite cold\" for some parents.\nHe said: \"It's one of the most important things you'll ever sort out, but from the other side it doesn't feel like that it's being treated with that level of reverence.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

Definitely was not a fan.” Expand Tweet Mikal Bridges played 40 minutes against Detroit and had 21 points. He had six points and three rebounds in limited minutes against Milwaukee.\nThe Nets also opted to rest starters Spencer Dinwiddie , Nic Claxton and Cameron Johnson and crucial reserve Dorian Finney-Smith in the Milwaukee game. Like Bridges, Cam Thomas – the leading scorer for Brooklyn – and veteran wing Royce O'Neale did not re-enter the game after the first quarter.\nNets coach Jacque Vaughn explained that the decision to limit playing time and rest key players was made to preserve their health:\n\"I have too much respect for the dudes that suit up and put their body on the line and the competition level to even mention the word exhibition,\" Vaughn said. \"Any guy could have ended their career tonight by one play, and so I treat it as such.\" Expand Tweet The Nets, currently standing at a 15-16 record, are scheduled to resume play on Friday with an away game against the Washington Wizards, who hold a 5-25 record.\nMikal Bridges keeps his Iron Man streak alive Mikal Bridges is known for his durability. He has been making headlines for his impressive streak of games played, having not missed a game since his junior year in high school.\nDespite playing limited minutes on Wednesday, he was able to keep the streak, which is the longest active streak in the NBA, to 423 games.\nDuring his college days at Villanova , Bridges played all 116 games for the Wildcats.\nEven when he was traded in the middle of the previous season, Bridges still participated in all possible games. His total number of games played last season amounted to 83, surpassing the standard 82-game total per team.\nBridges is averaging 21.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 33.9 minutes per game this season.\nRecommended Video How did Michael Jordan's gambling \"habit\" taint his image?",

    "text": "Mauvaise nouvelle chez Microsoft. Le géant de la tech va en effet licencier 650 employés de sa branche de jeux vidéo. Une nouvelle « difficile à entendre », a admis jeudi Phil Spencer, le patron des jeux vidéo du groupe informatique, dans une lettre aux employés.Cette décision est avant tout destinée à réduire les coûts après le rachat d'Activision Blizzard , l'éditeur de titres à succès tels que Call of Duty et Candy Crush. En janvier, le groupe s'était déjà séparé de 1.900 de ses salariés.« Dans le cadre de la restructuration de nos équipes après l'acquisition […], nous avons pris la décision de supprimer environ 650 postes dans l'ensemble de Microsoft Gaming - principalement des fonctions administratives - afin d'organiser nos activités en vue d'une réussite à long terme », justifie encore Phil Spencer dans cette lettre. Avant d'affirmer que cette nouvelle coupe des effectifs et cette réorganisation permettront d'assurer une « croissance future durable ». Toujours selon Phil Spencer, aucun jeu ou nouveau produit ne sera annulé, et aucun studio ne sera fermé.\nPublicité\nDes annonces qui ont, sans surprise, provoqué la colère des syndicats et notamment le puissant Communication Workers of America (CWA), qui revendique plus de 6.000 membres dans les secteurs peu syndiqués des technologies et des jeux vidéo.Please read the following statement from @CWAUnion regarding Microsoft's decision to lay off 650 video game workers: https://t.co/VCt0JWfu07 « Nous aurions pu espérer qu'une entreprise comme Microsoft, qui a réalisé 88 milliards de dollars de bénéfice net l'année dernière, puisse réussir sur le long terme sans détruire les moyens de subsistance de 650 de nos collègues », explique le syndicat dans un communiqué où il affiche sa solidarité avec « tous ceux qui ont perdu leur emploi aujourd'hui ».« Les licenciements impitoyables de ce type sont devenus trop fréquents », a, de son côté, réagi Samuel Cooper, un producteur du jeu World of Warcraft des studios Blizzard, et membre du syndicat CWA. Microsoft qui a finalisé en octobre dernier l'acquisition d'Activision Blizzard pour 69 milliards de dollars, a aussi fermé en mai quatre studios de l'éditeur Bethesda, qu'il avait racheté en 2020. ZOOM - Les géants de la tech n'ont plus la cote auprès des salariés Et d'autres groupes du secteur ont aussi annoncé des suppressions de postes. A l'image de Sony ou de l'éditeur américain de jeux vidéo Electronic Arts . Des décisions prises parfois sans état d'âme. L'ancien président de Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Chris Deering, a ainsi suggéré, lors d'une interview sur le podcast « My Perfect Console », que les personnes subitement au chômage aillent vivre dans un endroit pas cher près d'une plage ou « conduisent un Uber » jusqu'à ce que le marché de l'emploi s'améliore.",

    "text": "Read full article The Hockey News - Buffalo Sabres Potential Sabres Star Target Is Off the Board michael derosa Thu, Jul 25, 2024, 11:04 PM · 1 min read Link Copied\nIt is no secret that the Buffalo Sabres could use one more top-six winger. While they have completely revamped their bottom six, they still lack the last star they need.\nBecause of this, one player who stood out as a potential trade target for the Sabres was Philadelphia Flyers forward Travis Konecny . The London, Ontario native was set to become an unrestricted free agent next summer, but now that will officially not be coming to fruition.\nKonecny has signed an eight-year, $70 million contract extension with the Flyers. With this, there is no question that he will be staying with the Flyers for a very long time.\nTravis Konecny\n© Kyle Ross-USA TODAY Sports\nKonecny would have been an excellent addition to the Sabres' lineup if acquired. The 27-year-old has become a star for Philadelphia, and last season was no different. In 76 games with the Metropolitan Division club, he had 33 goals and 68 points - both new career highs.\nWhile the chances of Konecny getting dealt during next season are non-existent after this deal, the Sabres still have other potential top-six options which they could target. Some include Nikolaj Ehlers ( Winnipeg Jets ), Trevor Zegras ( Anaheim Ducks ), and Frank Vatrano (Ducks).\nRecent Sabres News Sabres Surging Forward Is Big-Time Breakout Candidate\nSabres Reveal Numbers for New Additions\nSabres Have Target in Ex-Canadiens Forward\nSabres Have Prime Target in Former All-Star\nPromising Sabres Prospect Can't Be Slept On\nSabres Hit Home Run Drafting Rising Star\nSabres Newcomer Should Hit Higher Level",

Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed strong military action against Hezbollah amidst airstrikes in Beirut and cross-border attacks. The violence has displaced thousands and killed hundreds, raising fears of another prolonged conflict similar to the 2006 war. Israel's military intercepted a missile from Yemen, triggering air raid sirens across central Israel, including Tel Aviv. Previously, on October 7, another missile from Yemen had struck central Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed robust military action against Hezbollah, further denting ceasefire hopes proposed by US and European officials. Israeli strikes in Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander as the militant group launched rockets into Israel. The conflict has displaced thousands near the Israel-Lebanon border. Netanyahu, attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York, faced international pressure to halt the violence temporarily. Amid intensified strikes targeting Hezbollah, hundreds have died in Lebanon. Despite diplomatic efforts, Israel continues its military operations, displacing 100,000 Lebanese and preparing for a possible ground invasion. The escalation revives fears of a repeat of the 2006 war. (With inputs from agencies.)",

Between 2 and 3 inches of rain fell in northern counties where rivers and streams are already full from two previous rounds of rain. Swept away by rushing water Rising water in the Raritan River swept a man off a walking path and into the water Thursday morning according to the Somerville Rescue Squad. The man became trapped in several bamboo trees and was clinging to a log before the Somerville Rescue Squad arrived. A water rescue team reached the man and got him out using a flotation device. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of hypothermia. Flood Warnings still in effect Flood Warnings remain in effect as the Millstone River in Somerset County, the Rockaway River in Morris County and the Passaic River in Essex, Morris & Passaic counties. “It’s the same situation as our last super-soaker rain storm. All that water has to go someplace. The water flowing downstream is causing waters to approach and exceed flood stage,” according to New Jersey 101.5 Chief Meteorologist Dan Zarrow. The Passaic River in Little Falls is expected to crest just over flood stage at 7.4 Friday night and then start to recede, according to Zarrow. “The Millstone River at Blackwells River crested above its flood state at a record 10 feet Friday morning and had already started to recede. “ It broke the record of 9.3 feet set in March 2011, according to National Weather Service records. No relief until Sunday The Rockaway River at Boonton Below Reservoir also broke a long-standing record cresting at 6 feet on Vail Road in Montville Friday morning. The previous flood level was 5.7 feet set in April 1986. A Flood Warning remains posted until Sunday for the Passaic River above Singac which went above flood stage at 9.1 feet Friday morning. It will remain there until Sunday morning. The water level will likely match a flood level of 9.3 feet set in April 2022. The Passaic River at Pine Brook, which affects Essex, Passaic and Morris counties, is under a flood warning until further notice. The river rose to 19.7 feet and will not stop rising until it hits 19.9 feet Friday night. The river’s high mark is 19.8 feet set in January 1996. New Jersey 101.5 Fast Traffic is tracking the remaining road closures all weekend long. \"The good news is that New Jersey's weather has dried out completely, and there are no big storms on the horizon for about a week. That will allow rivers and floodwaters to continue receding,\" Zarrow said.

    "title": "Primeira trufa cultivada em clima tropical é descoberta em Morungaba, SP! Entenda TUDO:",
    "text": "Uma descoberta inédita no mundo da truficultura está moldando o futuro do cultivo de trufas no Brasil. Em setembro de 2024, uma trufa foi encontrada em Morungaba, no interior de São Paulo , marcando a primeira vez que essa iguaria foi cultivada em um clima tropical. Este feito incrível foi liderado pelo engenheiro Fernando Heer, do Projeto Jaguarubá, e promete revolucionar o potencial brasileiro de produção de trufas. O crescente interesse pela produção de trufas no Brasil teve início com o ambicioso Projeto Jaguarubá, iniciado em 2015. Inicialmente, o projeto concentrou-se na plantação de florestas de madeira nobre, mas em 2020, passou a focar também no cultivo de trufas, sob a consultoria de especialistas como o biólogo Marcelo Sulzbacher e o engenheiro agrônomo Marcio Frantz. Juntos, eles transformaram antigas pastagens de gado em um viveiro de trufas promissor. Como a Trufa Foi Cultivada nos Trópicos? O processo que levou ao cultivo das trufas em climas mais quentes foi engenhoso. O uso de nogueiras-pecã foi essencial, pois essas árvores, uma vez inoculadas com esporos de trufa, criam o ambiente perfeito para o desenvolvimento do fungo. Em setembro de 2024, o cultivo brasileiro foi coroado com sucesso quando a equipe encontrou uma pequena trufa imatura, sinalizando um avanço significativo para a agricultura nacional. Ao contrário das expectativas anteriores, a trufa foi encontrada em menos de dois anos, muito mais rápido do que o cronograma padrão europeu, que pode levar de seis a oito anos. Isso aconteceu graças ao intemperismo do solo brasileiro, que acelerou o desenvolvimento da trufa conhecida como Sapucay, uma variante do gênero Tuber. O Que São as Trufas e Por Que São Valiosas? As trufas são um tipo de fungo subterrâneo da família Tuber, que se desenvolve em simbiose com raízes de árvores como carvalhos e nogueiras-pecã. Conhecidas por seu aroma e sabor intensos, esses cogumelos têm um grande valor no mercado gastronômico, especialmente as variedades como a trufa branca italiana e a trufa negra francesa. Na culinária, as trufas são um ingrediente luxuoso. Embora cresçam naturalmente em regiões de clima frio, seu cultivo em regiões tropicais como o Sudeste do Brasil representa uma nova fronteira. Assim, a adaptação do cultivo para áreas semi-tropicais na Serra Gaúcha já se mostrava viável antes da descoberta em Morungaba. Qual é o Futuro da Truficultura no Brasil? O impacto da trufa tropical brasileira é promissor, sugerindo um potencial de exportação não só do produto, mas também da tecnologia de cultivo para outras regiões do mundo. Com um mercado que valoriza iguarias como essas, o Brasil pode se tornar um novo pólo de referência na truficultura, oferecendo uma alternativa viável para áreas impactadas pelas mudanças climáticas. A valorização das trufas no mercado internacional também promete trazer benefícios econômicos para os produtores locais. A Sapucay, descoberta em várias propriedades no Brasil, tem um valor de mercado elevado, comparado às variedades mais prestigiadas da Europa, tornando o cultivo e a comercialização ainda mais atraentes. Em conclusão, a descoberta em Morungaba é mais do que um marco para a agricultura tropical; é uma demonstração de como a inovação pode transformar o cenário agrícola de um país, abrindo novas oportunidades de crescimento econômico e sustentável.

    "text": "Elisabeth Braw is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, the author of the award-winning “Goodbye Globalization” and a regular columnist for POLITICO. EU diplomat Johan Floderus is now back home in Sweden, and so is Iranian-Swedish dual national Saeed Azizi. Professional basketball player Brittney Griner is safely back in America, while consultant Michael Spavor and diplomat Michael Kovrig are back in Canada. You may be familiar with these names — individuals who were exchanged for a person their state captors wanted released, making headlines across the world over.",
