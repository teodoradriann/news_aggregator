    "title": "Oscar nods in directing don’t reflect a wonderfully wide-ranging year",
    "text": "There was a bittersweet symmetry to be found in learning of the death of Norman Jewison just a day before the announcement of this year’s Oscar nominees.\nJewison, who died Saturday at age 97, was one of the great journeyman directors in Hollywood, the stylistically unobtrusive craftsman who brought the gripping civil rights-era drama “In the Heat of the Night” to the screen, as well as the brilliant Cold War comedy “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming,” the musicals “Fiddler on the Roof” and “Jesus Christ Superstar,” and the earthily relatable romantic comedy “Moonstruck.” Jewison, who was born in Toronto, was never an obvious polemicist, but always sought out to give his films substance. “I don’t make social statements in my pictures, though I do feel a film should be about something,” he once told the New York Times, according to his Washington Post obituary. “It should not shy away from social problems.”\nThe 10 movies that were nominated for best picture on Tuesday suggest that Jewison’s successors feel the same way. Wide-ranging in style, many of the films in contention address historical or present-day issues: the interrogation of race in “American Fiction” and critiques of sexism in “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Barbie” and “Poor Things”; morally attuned excavations of the past in “Oppenheimer,” about the development of the nuclear bomb; “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which dramatized the decimation of a Native American community in the name of capitalistic “progress”; and “The Zone of Interest,” which recounted a German family’s complicity with the Holocaust.\nIn theme, sensibility and aesthetic language, the best picture nominees reflect a hearteningly diverse artistic ecosystem. When it came to nominating directors, though, members of that branch of the academy clearly rewarded self-conscious auteurism over Jewison-esque accessibility. “Poor Things” and “Barbie” were essentially the same story, as wryly observant portraits of an agency-free doll coming to life and political consciousness. Although “Poor Things” director Yorgos Lanthimos made the cut – understandably, given his film’s wildly imaginative vision and ambitious execution – was “Barbie’s” Greta Gerwig snubbed because her razor-sharp feminist message was delivered inside the candy apple coating of a big, fun, mainstream comedy? (Although Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera were nominated for their supporting turns in “Barbie,” the irony of Gerwig and producer-star Margot Robbie being overlooked in the directing and lead actress categories, respectively, was immediate fodder for social media outrage: “Greta Gerwig: Made a critically acclaimed, culturally profound, feminist movie about Barbie and the patriarchy that made a billion dollars at the box office. Oscar nomination goes to … Ken,” wrote activist Shannon Watts on X, formerly Twitter.)\nThe girl bosses behind “Barbie” weren’t entirely ignored: Robbie was honored in the best picture nomination as one of the film’s producers, Gerwig as its co-screenwriter. And Gerwig has already been nominated for her directing, for her 2017 debut film, “Lady Bird.” This year, two other first-timers easily could have been included: Cord Jefferson and Celine Song, whose films “American Fiction” and “Past Lives,” respectively, might have been too subtle and human-scale to stand out next to big swings by the likes of Christopher Nolan and movie-god Martin Scorsese. The same could be said for Alexander Payne, whose tender, carefully calibrated comedy-drama “The Holdovers” draws a direct line to Jewison, having been inspired by the work of Hal Ashby, the director of such winsomely humane comedies as “Harold and Maude,” and who learned to direct as Jewison’s longtime editor.\nWith only five slots in the directing category, as opposed to 10 in best picture, the inevitable parlor games will lie in selecting which filmmakers to eliminate in favor of one’s favorites; this year, I would gently nudge Scorsese aside to make room for Jefferson, Payne or Gerwig. Still, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to argue with the sheer audacity and skill on display in “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Oppenheimer,” “Poor Things” and “The Zone of Interest,” each of which exemplified the kind of narrative sense, tonal control and technical chops we mean when we say something’s been well-directed.\nPull the lens back, and the picture is even more encouraging, with a list of best picture nominees that reflect an exceptionally healthy and diverse year, not just in moviemaking but in moviegoing. If 2023 will be remembered for anything (outside of Taylor Swift), it will be for the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, which witnessed millions of viewers around the world flocking to see two smart, utterly original spectacles – one about a quirky theoretical physicist and the other a piece of quirkily theoretical agitprop. The success of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” – and the deserved attention their co-nominees will receive in the next two months – gives the lie to a fear that Jewison expressed in the New York Times in 2001, when he noted that Hollywood didn’t make his kind of movies anymore.\n“They’d say these films were too wordy, too cerebral, too much dialogue,” observed Jewison – who, it bears noting, was nominated three times for directing but never won a competitive Oscar. “So many aspects of our life have disappeared from movie screens.”\nIf this year’s Oscars are any indication, that tide has been turned back, at least for now.\nSuccess.

    "title": "TROLL TRAINING: FITNESS GIZMOS FOR MOTOCROSS RACERS",
    "text": "TROLL TRAINING: FITNESS GIZMOS FOR MOTOCROSS RACERS\nBY ALEX MARTIN\nPro racers are constantly seeking ways to gain a competitive edge and elevate their performance on the racetrack. Guys like Ken Roczen, Chase Sexton, Adam Cianciarulo, Justin Barcia and others utilize products like the Oura ring, Whoop band, and Polar and Garmin watches. These devices aim to help us understand how our bodies respond to the stress and demands of training, racing and travel. I’ve used an Oura ring for the last three years and have been tracking my resting heart rate for over 14 years. Over time, I’ve discovered some interesting things about how my body responds to training, certain foods, drinks and racing. For example, I love a good cold beer, especially on a hot summer evening, but my sleep is negatively affected by a raised body temperature, a resting heart rate of four to five beats over baseline, and my HRV (heart rate variability) plummeting.\nMy lowest resting heart rate would typically come in the off-season when I was putting in high-volume training weeks. It would be around 38 bpm (beats per minute) on average. Even more interesting is the highest HRV numbers I’ve ever had, which came after my best 450 Supercross finish in Foxborough (ninth place), and later that year when I got my first top-10 overall in the 450 class at the Washougal National. If I had kept track of HRV numbers earlier in my career, I would probably have even better data from my 250 days, but alas, I can’t go back in time. Now, there are a ton of metrics we could sift through, but here are the two that I believe are the most important to pay attention to:\n(1) Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. High HRV indicates a healthy autonomic nervous system and efficient recovery from stressors, while low HRV may signal fatigue, over-training or other physiological imbalances. Based on HRV data, athletes can tailor their training intensity, ensuring optimal recovery and performance on race day.\n(2) Resting Heart Rate (RHR) refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute while the body is at rest. It serves as a critical indicator of cardiovascular health and fitness level. A lower RHR typically suggests better cardiovascular efficiency and overall health. At the same time, a high RHR may indicate you are coming down with a cold or are tired from previous training sessions.\nHow can we utilize this data? Regularly using these wearables allows us to gain comprehensive insights into our physiological states. By analyzing trends in the data, we can make informed decisions. Here are some examples.\nIdentifying over-training: Consistently elevated RHR or reduced HRV may indicate over-training or inadequate recovery. We can adjust our training intensity and volume by monitoring these metrics to prevent burnout and optimize performance.\nOptimizing sleep quality: Adequate sleep is essential for recovery and performance optimization. By correlating RHR and HRV data with sleep metrics, such as duration, quality and stages, we can identify factors influencing sleep quality and make adjustments to enhance restorative sleep.\nManaging stress levels: Physical and psychological stress can significantly impact RHR and HRV. By recognizing patterns of increased stress reflected in RHR and HRV data, we can implement stress-management techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation or relaxation exercises to restore balance and improve recovery.\nThere’s a catch : You may be thinking, “Wow, I need to buy one of these wearables ASAP!” But wait, here’s the catch: There have been countless times when my RHR or HRV was lower than expected or plain off. I’ve woken up the morning of a race and my Oura ring is telling me to take the day off. When you get paid to race, that is just not going to happen! Ultimately, this technology is designed to help you, and these wearables can give you great feedback on training and lifestyle habits, but you can’t live and die by the data, as sometimes there is more to the story. Utilizing these wearables in combination with a good old-fashioned body check and being in tune with how you feel is usually the best strategy.\nAlex Martin raced on the AMA Pro circuit for 15 years. He has won AMA Nationals and has over 20 podium finishes under his belt. After Alex retired from Pro racing, he started a training company called “Troll Training.” Alex wrote 16 training articales for MXA before taking over the management of his families Spring Creek National track.

    "text": "Escánalo entre Argentina y Mauritania en el torneo de L´Alcudia Luego del histórico escándalo que se vivió en el torneo de fútbol masculino de los Juegos Olímpicos de París, donde la Argentina atravesó momentos de incertidumbre debido a las controvertidas decisiones de la organización y anular un gol después de casi dos horas, la Albiceleste volvió a protagonizar un episodio lamentable en el tradicional torneo de L’Alcudia.\nOtra vez, los jóvenes sudamericanos debieron comenzar su participación con un seleccionado africano. Así como en la capital de Francia, el debuto del combinado liderado por Javier Mascherano tuvo que enfrentar a Marruecos , en Valencia el elenco Sub 20 a cargo de Diego Placente tuvo su compromiso frente a Mauritania . Y el final no pasó desapercibido.\nEs que el árbitro sancionó un penal a favor del combinado sudamericano en las instancias finales del partido y los jóvenes africanos reaccionaron con violencia. El marcador lo había abierto Bilal Maoulaul , de cabeza, y Mauritania acariciaba las semifinales porque el triunfo le permitía clasificar a la fase de los cuatro mejores. Con superioridad numérica por la expulsión de Juan Villalba , la historia cambió cuando el juez cobró la pena máxima cuando dos intérpretes fueron a la disputa del balón de manera imprudente y derrumbaron al argentino Santiago Sosa dentro del área. Una falta que en otro contexto no tendría discusión.\nLa reacción del público y los jugadores mauritanos fue instantánea y violenta . De acuerdo a las imágenes que se viralizaron en las redes sociales, la policía tuvo que intervenir en el campo de juego para proteger al árbitro y escoltarlo hasta el vestuario. Es que además de la invasión de los simpatizantes y familiares, los propios futbolistas de Mauritania arremetieron contra la autoridad de manera furiosa.\nA pesar de la suspensión momentánea del espectáculo, Carrizo se hizo cargo de la ejecución y selló el 1 a 1 para que la Argentina pudiera evitar la derrota en territorio español. Naturalmente, cuando concluyó el espectáculo la Guardia Civil debió intervenir para escoltar al árbitro para abandonar la cancha hasta llegar a una zona segura en los vestuarios.\nEl plantel está conformado por varios nombres conocidos, como los de Valentino Acuña , el joven de Newell’s que jugó el Mundial Sub 17 y supo oficiar de doble de Messi en una película, e Iker Zufiaurre , atacante que ya comenzó a tener rodaje en Boca bajo la tutela de Diego Martínez. También el citado Alex Woiski , nacido el 17 de marzo de 2006 en España , pero que eligió jugar por la Albiceleste, en un caso parecido al de Alejandro Garnacho. eE hijo de Ronnie Woiski, un representante de futbolistas español, y Laura Pioletti , una argentina oriunda de Mar del Plata.\nEl equipo de Placente se mantiene en la cima del Grupo B con 7 unidades , la misma cantidad que Mauritania , mientras que Valencia se ubica tercero con 4 puntos, Levante suma uno y el combinado brasileño cierra la tabla tras haber perdido en sus dos primeras presentaciones.\nEl conjunto nacional, que participa por décima vez en el torneo, se ubica cuarto en el palmarés, con tres campeonatos en su haber (2012, 2018 y 2022) y dos subcampeonatos (2013 y 2016). El resto de los equipos participantes son Elche, Sevilla, Arabia Saudita, Uruguay y Villarreal. Los dos primeros de cada zona accederán a las semifinales.",

    "text": "转自： 中国医药 报\n近日，IQVIA Institute基于IQVIA databases及第三方机构统计的数据，对2024年全球医药行业投融资、新药上市以及临床试验活动情况进行了分析与回顾。结果显示，2024年该行业呈现出投融资规模回升、新药上市数量增加、临床试验活动趋稳的趋势。这些趋势表明，医药行业正在逐步恢复增长动力，并展现出强大的创新能力和发展潜力。\n2024年，全球生物医药行业投融资规模有所回升\n2024年，全球生物医药行业投融资规模从2023年的710亿美元回升至1020亿美元。\n再融资成为2024年最主要的融资类型，达460亿美元，占2024年生物医药行业融资总额的45%，较2023年的260亿美元增长了77%。\n2024年，生物医药行业IPO总金额达约70亿美元，超过了2023年的40亿美元，但仍处于历史较低水平。\n私募融资、公募及其他融资持续超过新冠疫情前水平，分别为240亿美元和250亿美元。\n中国新药上市数量持续增加，上市时间持续加快\n中国上市的新型活性物质数量不断增加。2020年至2024年，中国上市了188个新型活性物质，与2015年至2019年相比增长了近50%。中国新药的上市数量大幅增加，并已开始缩小与其他主要国家和地区的差距。\n中国上市的新药不仅来自跨国企业，2020年至2024年上市的新药中，有40%仅在中国上市，且全部由中国企业生产。\n对于在中国上市的全球新药来说，上市时长中位数已从2005年至2009年的9.6年，下降到了2020年至2024年的3.7年。这激励了跨国企业更加积极地在中国上市新药。\n2020年至2024年，76个仅在中国上市的新药中，近60%为抗肿瘤药物，高于此类药物在全球上市的比例。\n2024年，临床试验启动总数稳定在新冠疫情前水平\n2024年，全球临床试验启动总数稳定在5318项，继2023年下降后又回到了2019年的水平，表明新冠疫情后的临床试验活动已趋于正常。\n相较于2023年，2024年Ⅰ期临床试验数量有所减少，Ⅱ期和Ⅲ期临床试验研究数量较多，表明近期临床试验效率可能得到了提高。\n2021年的临床试验启动数达到峰值，为6432项，至2024年临床试验数量为5318项，逐步减少了1114项。在减少的临床试验中，有一半以上来自关于COVID-19的临床试验，虽然COVID-19的影响有所缓解，但临床试验启动或完成的历史性延误仍会影响相关企业的后续活动，尤其是更加依赖外部资金的公司。\n2024年，前四大疾病领域占据71%的临床试验\n2024年，肿瘤、免疫、神经疾病和心血管疾病四大疾病领域的临床试验启动数，合计占2024年临床试验启动总数的71%。其中，肿瘤领域仍是新增临床试验的重点，2024年占比达41%，高于2015年的38%；免疫领域的临床试验启动数占比14%，低于2015年的18%；神经疾病领域的临床试验启动数占比11%，低于2015年的16%，其中包括罕见病和更广泛患者人群研究对象；心血管疾病的临床试验启动数占比5%，这一数字在2015年至2024年间缓慢下降，降幅超过除传染病外的所有其他治疗领域。\n近年来，围绕肥胖症治疗开展的药物临床试验活动增长势头强劲，2024年肥胖症治疗药物临床试验的启动较2023年增加了77%。\n2024年，肿瘤领域新型疗法临床试验占比超过三分之一\n2015年至2024年，肿瘤领域的药物研发越来越关注用于治疗且具有创新作用机制的靶向药物。\n2024年，细胞和基因疗法、ADC和多特异性抗体等新型疗法已占据肿瘤领域临床试验总数的35%，其中32%针对实体瘤，43%针对血液瘤。\nPD-1/PD-L1是免疫肿瘤领域的主要靶点，相较2015年，其临床试验数量显著增长。但与2023年相比，2024年实体瘤领域临床试验数量增速有所下降。\n多特异性抗体临床试验数量大幅增长。2024年，在血液瘤临床试验中占比17%，在实体肿瘤临床试验中占比11%，这表明申办方对多靶点药物的兴趣日益增长。\n在肿瘤领域，许多新型ADC正在研发中，可实现向肿瘤靶向递送细胞毒性有效载荷；2024年，这些药物在血液瘤临床试验中占比5%，在实体瘤临床试验中占比15%。\n（本版稿件由IQVIA提供）",
