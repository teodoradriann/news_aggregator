    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared to those elsewhere in the west, Leo Varadkar has insisted.The Taoiseach said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of victims of crime in Dublin, he noted that such incidents are not common place in the Republic’s capital.There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of random attacks and assaults on people in the city.That scrutiny intensified in the wake of rioting in November after a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are now unsafe. Varadkar's government has rejected claims.When asked about the issue of safety in Dublin, the Taoiseach said: “There’s no city that’s 100% safe. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\"There is also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. \"Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. \"That’s the approach that we’re taking.\"Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, Vradkar added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.“\"Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.The Taoiseach concluded that: “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

    "title": "Brooke Shields' daughter Grier says nepo-baby tag \"hurts my feelings\"",
    "text": "Brooke Shields’ daughter Grier has shared her opinion on the infamous nepo-baby tag saying that it “hurts her feelings”. In an exclusive interview with People, Shields’ 18 year old daughter and model Grier, opened up about being raised by the model and actress and discussed the nepo-baby tag that has been making its round for a few years now. “My mom says I can get you in a room but I can’t get you to stay there,” she told the outlet, explaining that though her mother’s name can open doors, they’re not guaranteed to always stay open and bring in opportunities. “People have referred to me by that term [nepo-baby] a bajillion times,” Grier added. “It doesn’t really affect me because they are sitting behind a screen commenting on my social media [but] it hurts my feelings. Obviously wanting to model and having a mom that models, helps, but also if I get there and they hate the way I look, they’re not going to ask me to come back.” She went on say that “Having a famous mom can only get you so far,” adding that if she and her sister – 21-year-old Rowan – were horrible at their jobs, they’d be fired despite who their mother is. “You have to be good at what you’re doing to keep the job.” In other nepo-baby discourse, Emma Robbers recently opened up about the term and shared that her famous relatives have actually caused her to be turned down for jobs in Hollywood in the past . Recommended While appearing on the Table For Two podcast back in June, she spoke about the difficulty of people assuming she has it easy and ignoring the failures that she has had to endure . Lily Allen has also previously spoken out against the ‘nepo baby’ concept , describing it as sexist. “I feel like young girls get it harder with the nepo baby thing,” she said. “I don’t really see people calling out sons of famous actors — not that they should be called out. I don’t think anyone should be called out for wanting to follow their dream.” Willow Smith, meanwhile, has admitted to feeling a sense of “insecurity” about the term .",

    "text": "By Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis\nAYODHYA, India (Reuters) – Less than a month before a grand Hindu temple opens, India’s northern town of Ayodhya is buzzing with activity as finishing touches are put on a project seen as the centrepiece of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election campaign.\nOnce a sleepy temple town in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya has received a new airport and roads in a $6-billion facelift as Modi prepares to inaugurate the temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities.\nA day before Modi was set to inaugurate the airport and a renovated train station, workers decorated the streets with flowers, amid a swarm of police.\n“Soon our Lord will be in his original place,” said Girish Sahastrabhojane, who worked on the design of the temple, which forms part of a sprawling 70-acre (28-hectare) complex of carved pink sandstone and white marble.\n“Our Lord Ram was born here and the Hindus of India, and also abroad, have been waiting for it since 1992,” the engineer involved in the construction told visiting reporters.\nBut Modi’s opponents have accused him of stoking religious sentiment to further his political ambitions, and several opposition leaders have declined an invitation to attend the temple’s inauguration.\nOn Jan. 22, Modi will pray for the first time before an idol of Lord Ram at the project, which cost more than 20 billion rupees ($240 million), and where more than 4,500 workers are labouring round the clock to complete the ground floor.\nWearing hardhats and safety shoes, they worked on Friday to carve pillars and lift stones amid cranes towering over the site, which Sahastrabhojane said could accommodate 125,000 people in a day.\nModi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims.\nHe has made its construction an emotive issue in many speeches ahead of next year’s general elections, widely expected to secure him a third term.\nNationwide riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them minority Muslims, broke out in 1992 after a Hindu mob razed the Babri mosque – where the temple will stand – saying it was built on the site of an earlier Hindu temple.\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court ordered that Hindus be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.\n($1=83.1875 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis in Ayodhya; Writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

Douglas Soule USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida Show Caption\nHide Caption\nTropical waves explained: How tropical waves affect the weather Tropical waves do not refer to the storm surge waves you see during a tropical storm or a hurricane. It is an entirely meteorological term explaining the beginning phase of tropical storm development. Gov. Ron DeSantis put the vast majority of Florida counties in a state of emergency in preparation for the potential landfall of a storm that could become the first \"significant threat\" to the state in what is expected to be a violent hurricane season.\n\"Based on meteorological reports, there is significant threat of heavy rainfal l over most of the State of Florida, with the possibility of at least 12 inches of rainfall over the next seven days,\" reads the Thursday evening executive order. \"The water tables in the affected areas are already nearing peak capacity and incoming heavy rainfall will cause significant river flooding that may last for several weeks.\"\nThe counties under a state of emergency : Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Hillsborough, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Monroe, Nassau, Okaloosa, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington.\nIn a Thursday afternoon advisory , the National Hurricane Center said there's a 70% chance that a well-defined tropical wave — designated Invest 97L — could develop into a tropical depression in the week near Florida or over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nThe NHC said there's a 30% chance it develops in the next 48 hours.\nIf the storm does develop into a tropical depression and reaches sustained windspeeds of 39 mph, it would become Tropical Storm Debby .\nDeclaring a state of emergency allows state and local governments much more freedom to coordinate their emergency agencies, relax restrictions, cut through red tape and reallocate resources to quickly deal with an imminent or ongoing threat that local services can't handle on their own.\nThis reporting content is supported by a partnership with Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.
