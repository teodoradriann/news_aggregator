    "title": "Orban said that Ukraine cannot defeat Russia on the battlefield without the direct involvement of NATO – 2024-09-26 18:41:12",
    "text": "/ world today news/ “Victory on the battlefield is not in sight for the Ukrainians”: The Prime Minister of Hungary brought down his NATO partners from heaven to earth\nIn early May, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stunned his Western counterparts by declaring that “a situation in which Russia would come to terms with its defeat is only possible in fairy tales.” But they still didn’t get it. On the contrary, after that there were very strong calls from Western leaders about the need to “defeat Russia”.\nWe know from history that there are people who are “ born to make fairy tales come true’. But how such tales end, we also remember, the grass of oblivion has not yet grown on the endless battlefields of Europe.\nOrbán once again tried to bring his colleagues back to reality, who continue to rave about the charming tales of “victory” over Russia. In an interview with Bloomberg, the Hungarian Prime Minister said: “My position is this: based on the actual situation, on the numbers, on the state of affairs – and, by the way, on the fact that NATO is not ready to send its troops – it becomes quite obvious that a victory on the battlefield for the poor Ukrainians , by no means outlined.” And he added that instead of escalating the battlefield, the path to peace and negotiations should be sought.\nAlas, they are unlikely to hear it even now: the Western propaganda, ideological and political entourage plays up its superiority too enthusiastically and is clearly not ready to admit that “ the king is naked’.\nAt the recent security conference in Tallinn, hundreds “prominent politicians, analysts, leaders, military personnel and scientists from around the world” discussed the situation in Ukraine writes Joseph Syracuse in his Sky News column. And here is the sad conclusion he draws: “The conference participants had hardened anti-Russian personalities (…). These figures did not show even a minimal desire and aspiration for a ceasefire.\n„ I was hoping the author admits, – that at the Tallinn conference there would be some kind of meeting devoted to achieving peace and discussing what that peace should be… However, there was no diplomacy in Tallinn. The conference turned out to be relentlessly anti-Russian. Europeans believe that Ukraine’s victory is very important and inevitable. But they are wrong.\nBecause of this position of Europe are the exaggerated and far from realistic hopes of Ukraine… The participants of the conference only added fuel to the fire, demanding and calling for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe, with the inclusion of Moldova, Georgia and, of course, Ukraine. “\nAlas, inflaming themselves, Western experts and politicians are drifting further and further away from reality. And God bless them, as long as they weren’t the real battles in the center of Europe, in which thousands of people died. The Sky News author is bitter about the fate of Ukraine: “ When a country loses so many people to problems that could be solved diplomatically with collective will and diplomatic imagination (they could indeed be resolved even before the start of hostilities on February 23 last year), it is necessary to go an extra way.\nFor now, the pragmatist Orban is alone among Europe’s political elite. And the realist Syracuse was the only one who remembered diplomacy at the security conference held in Estonia. So far it cannot be said that “the process has begun”. The idea of ​​a fair end to the Ukrainian crisis for Russia is demonstrably ignored in the West. On the contrary, they are making every effort to convince everyone of their invincibility, even at the cost of World War III.\n„ Is there a way out? asks Joseph Syracuse. – There is an alternative. Historian Jeff Roberts recently noted, “Military action can and should end in peace and a territorial settlement that will ensure Russia’s future security and protect the world from nuclear holocaust.”\nDon’t politicians understand this? Apart from Orban, is there anyone else capable of disbelieving the talk of Russia’s “defeat”? The French Foreign Ministry hinted yesterday at some “security guarantees” of Ukraine, but only after “completion of the military operation of the Russian Federation”. Good thing it’s not “after the victory of Ukraine”. Perhaps this is a spark of realism after all?\nSo the Vatican believes that the conflict can only be resolved by achieving peace. China, Brazil, South Africa are trying to convey the same idea to the West. No result so far. The bewitching power of anti-Russian storytellers is still at work. Maybe they will listen to Orbán after all?\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel or in Telegram:\n#Orban #Ukraine #defeat #Russia #battlefield #direct #involvement #NATO",

    "text": "Wet and stormy weekend WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - After a cool and quiet Halloween, expect a milder Friday before a wet weekend. Temperatures across the state will range from the mid 60s to the low 70s this afternoon under mainly sunny skies. Winds will be slightly breezy from the southeast, with gusts up to 25 mph. A storm system to the west will inch closer to the region over the next few days, bringing several rounds of showers and storms across Kansas. The first wave of showers and storms will arrive late tonight into Saturday morning. Additional rounds are expected on Sunday and Monday. Some storms could be strong to possibly severe on Sunday. The main threat would likely be some hail and strong winds. Most of the state will receive measurable rainfall. The heaviest will favor central and eastern Kansas, especially in areas with some of the worst drought conditions. Most of the rain should be out of the area by Election Day, with the middle of the week staying dry before another system takes aim for Kansas late next week, possibly bringing another chance for rain. WICHITA FORECAST: Today: Mostly sunny and milder. Wind: S/SE 10-20. High: 68. Tonight: Increasing clouds, storms arriving after 4AM. Wind: SE 5-10. Low: 54.

    "text": "The lower Hunter was rattled by a severe storm less than an hour after warnings were issued. The Bureau of Meteorology released a warning at 2:11pm, saying that Maitland, Cessnock, Singleton, Dungog and Newcastle were at risk. The warning was cancelled just over an hour later, but not before damage had hit. By 2:45pm, large raindrops and wind hit much of Newcastle - including the city and foreshore. It was followed by hail which melted shortly after hitting the ground. More than 1600 homes across the region - including 110 in Lambton, 60 in Tenambit and 1500 in Kurri Kurri and Heddon Greta - lost power. \"[Our] modem threw sparks and died. [Now] there's hail,\" a resident posted to Facebook. A spokesperson from Ausgrid told the Newcastle Herald experts were being sent to the affected suburbs around 3:30pm, aiming to determine the causes of outages. Any damaged equipment would be cleared. Fires and hazards from lightning strikes were also reported in the Hunter. A spokesperson from Fire and Rescue NSW said crews were responding to calls across the region following severe weather. A fire was reported west of the M1 in Killingworth shortly before 3:30pm. It was not yet known if the fire began from lightning. \"We certainly have had a number of calls to a number of lightning strikes,\" the spokesperson said, noting lightning had \"automatically set off\" some fire alarms and emergency service systems. State Emergency Service northern zone commander Chief Superintendent Andrew Cribb said 10 calls had been made to the SES in the Hunter. Most were for damaged roofs in Mayfield, Wallsend and Hamilton. A garden shed blew into the neighbours backyard in Wallsend. Just one call for help was made on the Central Coast after a tree fell onto a parked caravan in a campground. Further updates on lightning damage will be reported when available. The SES advises residents to: The severe thunderstorm warning remains current for the mid north coast area. Friday's stormfront come just days after parts of Maitland - particularly Rutherford - were hit with huge hailstones that [damaged roofs, cars and other property](https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8470249/christmas-day-2023-storm-wreaks-havoc-in-newcastle-and-cessnock/).

    "text": "[Andaui](/user/Andaui)a [elordenmundial.com](/go/link/3903604) [#21](c21#c-21) Como tienes los huevazos a estas alturas, de decir que solo van contra Hamas. Has visto la destruccion de las casas, el empuje que estan haciendo a los Palestinos hacia la frontera, la venta de terrenos Palestinos... de verdad van contra Hamas?\n[#24](c24#c-24) si consideras a todos los palestinos Hamas si, van contra Hamas, sean niños, ancianos, hospitales, periodistas…\n[#25](c25#c-25) Hamás los usa de escudos humanos. Si esto ya se ha visto, pero seguís con la misma...\nHasta la propia UNRWA, chantajeada y corrompida por Hamas, lo ha reconocido en tiempo no de guerra total. Imagina ahora\nhttps://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools\nCuando se den cuenta de que quién oprime a los Gazatís es Hamás\n[#29](c29#c-29) ¿Pero no afirmabais los prosionazis que la UNRWA era Hamas? Con ese argumento (basado en mentiras y bulos) ha presionado Israel para que otros países retiren su financiación a la misma, condenando así aún mas a la población de Gaza a la hambruna más atroz (pero según tú no hay genocidio ni limpieza étnica porque patatas).\nQue poca vergüenza y humanidad tenéis los sionazis.\n[#35](c35#c-35) Lo sabes perfectamente, al igual que un Nazi era alguien que seguía (o colaboraba/aceptaba) una ideología supremacista, xenófoba, genocida y carente del mínimo respeto por la vida humana (toda vida humana que no fuera aria) llamada nacionalsocialismo, un sionazi es alguien que sigue (o colabora/acepta) una ideología supremacista, xenófoba, genocida y carente del mínimo respeto por la vida humana (toda vida humana que no sea judia) llamada sionismo.\nEs facil, seguro que hasta tu lo entiendes, aunque si fuera necesario te hago un croquis con colores\n[#39](c39#c-39) si Israel tiene armas nucleares y son tan nazis pq no destroza Gaza?\npq las refriegas en Cisjordania son tan bajas si no son judíos?\nsi quieren matar a todos los no judíos pq un +20% de la población de Israel no lo es, y un 15% es musulmana?\ncomo es posible que un pais que quiere matar a todos los no judíos tenga parlamentarios de un grupo musulman en sus cámara legislativas?\n[#41](c41#c-41) si Israel tiene armas nucleares y son tan nazis pq no destroza Gaza?\nClaro, una idea brillante tirar un nuke justo en tu patio trasero, de genio estratega vaya... además ya están destrozando Gaza con bombas convencionales, no necesitan armamento nuclear para eso...\nhttps://www.epe.es/es/internacional/20240109/destruccion-israel-gaza-datos-satelite-96664598\npq las refriegas en Cisjordania son tan bajas si no son judíos?\nTan bajas son que han muerto 373 palestinos en Cisjordania desde el 7 de octubre (de momento) igual a ti te parece poco o normal, a la gente decente no.\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/es/mundo/aumenta-a-373-el-n%C3%BAmero-de-palestinos-asesinados-por-fuego-israel%C3%AD-en-cisjordania-desde-el-7-de-octubre/3118361#\nsi quieren matar a todos los no judíos pq un +20% de la población de Israel no lo es, y un 15% es musulmana?\nEsos ciudadanos israelíes no judíos, son ciudadanos de segunda, con leyes discriminatorias had-hoc creadas específicamente para ellos, sólo les falta hacer que se peguen una media luna amarilla en la ropa para identificarlos vaya...\nhttps://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-internacional-57209473\ncomo es posible que un pais que quiere matar a todos los no judíos tenga parlamentarios de un grupo musulman en sus cámara legislativas?\nBueno , esos parlamentarios musulmanes pueden estar siempre y cuando no cuestionen el estatus de \"estado nación judío\" de Israel, así como todas las leyes segregacionistas con los musulmanes, que se implantaron con la \"Ley del estado judío\" promovida por Nazinyahu y aprobada en 2018\nhttps://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-internacional-44891254\n[#52](c52#c-52)\nsi 372 te parece mucho en zonas de conflicto, 1200 en zonas te debe parecer un genocidio\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operaci%C3%B3n_Inundaci%C3%B3n_de_Al-Aqsa\nahora pasa de posible discriminación de leyer a Musulmanes libres en Israel, que, reitero, son el 15% de la población a esto:\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89xodo_jud%C3%ADo_de_pa%C3%ADses_musulmanes\n[#59](c59#c-59) ¿Y? ¿Acaso eso justifica 25.000 asesinatos y condenar a una población de dos millones de personas a unas condiciones infrahumanas de hambruna y miseria?\nTú blanqueamiento y justificación del\ngenocidio holocausto palestino es nauseabunda y es incitación al odio contra los musulmanes, no tengo nada mas que hablar con alguien de tu calaña.\n[#45](c45#c-45) La declaración universal de los derechos humanos recoge la prohibición de la tortura y la obligación de dar un trato humanitario a cualquier persona detenida.\nhttps://news.un.org/es/story/2018/11/1445771\nEs repugnante ver gente (por decir algo) como tú defendiendo el genocidio y la tortura.\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/es/mundo/aumentan-los-testimonios-sobre-casos-horribles-de-tortura-a-palestinos-detenidos-por-el-ej%C3%A9rcito-israel%C3%AD-en-gaza/3091672\n[#58](c58#c-58) Punto uno: hasta que algún organismo internacional, revise, investigue y audite todos los hechos del 7 de octubre, no me creo nada que provenga del gobierno Israelí, máxime cuando se está viendo que muchos civiles (y militares israelíes) fueron asesinados por fuego amigo de las IDF.\nPunto dos: aunque efectivamente Hamás hiciera todo eso de lo que se le acusa, eso no autoriza ni justifica que Israel haga lo mismo, es puro blanqueamiento de atrocidades lo que estás haciendo.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Menuda sarta de gilipolleces sionistas sueltas... Para liberar a los palestinos de Hamas, ¿Ves bien que Israel los aniquile? Que los utilice de escudos humanos no da via libre para que maten a los civiles!!!\nEl unico argumento que teneis es que quien condene los asesinatos indiscriminados de civiles, la mayoria de ellos niños, es de Hamas...\nEstais profundamente enfermos. Cualquiera que justifique el asesinato de inocentes es escoria.\n[#31](c31#c-31) te refieres por genocidio a las declaraciones abiertas de Irán?\nhttps://apnews.com/article/a033042303545d9ef783a95222d51b83\n[#1](c1#c-1) No, ellos no. Son los medios y otros gobiernos quienes los han escondido todo este tiempo, pero ya es imposible totalmente. Y ahora ya solo quedan los que se alegran (que no son pocos) que exterminen a \"todos esos putos moros\" y los que pensamos que los israelies son como los nazis.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Venía a poner exactamente esto. Si es que nunca se ha escondido. Lleva invadiendo Palestina durante décadas, asesinando, cogiendo terreno que no era suyo, terreno que organizaciones internaciones le habían dicho que era terreno Palestino... Y se sigue mirando para otro lado. Han asesinado a 25.000 niños inocentes y aún así, aún así EEUU sigue apoyando. Supongo que por el interés de tener ahí un estado americano para controlar todo oriente medio.\nBuenos días,\nMás de 15.000 niños asesinados en 4 meses.\nRepito.\nMás de 15.000 niños asesinados en 4 meses.\n[#40](c40#c-40) no valen menos, pero un adulto puede decidir (hasta cierto punto) el participar en el conflicto, o incluso se puede argumentar que están así \"porque no han luchado contra Hamás\", pero un niño no tiene culpa de nada. Ni está allí porque quiere ni hubiera podido hacer nada para evitar el conflicto.\nPD. Solo he intentado argumentar posibles excusas que podrían dar sobre un adulto, pero yo estoy en contra de todo sufrimiento, y los palestinos llevan ya más de una generación siendo robados, torturados y masacrados.\nLo que va a hacer Israel es amenazar a Europa:\n- \"No queremos a los palestinos aquí, y los vamos a exterminar\"\n- \"Si no queréis que los exterminemos, si tanto los queréis, acogedlos vosotros\"\n- \"Si no los queréis acoger, entonces la culpa de que mueran, será vuestra\"\nEsa es exactamente la jugada que nos prepara Israel para los próximos meses.\nY nosotros dándoles la bienvenida en Eurovisión. Tócate los cataplines.\n[#17](c17#c-17) La invasión silenciosa de occidente también es un plan, y es perpetrado por los mismos que exterminan en Haza y machacan a cualquier palestino desde hace 70 años. Son los amos del mundo y harán lo que quieran.\nSe veía venir a kilómetros lo de Gaza\n1- iros al sur anda que vamos a bombardear el norte\n2- ahora atacamos también el sur ok? que hay terroristas y tal\n3- oye, ya que estamos, y que se os ve en esas condiciones tan inhumanas...\nPero luego que nadie diga nada a favor de la gente de Gaza en GB, Alemania o EEUU, que si antisemitas y no se qué porras y esos son boicots sanos vistos desde ese lado\n[#19](c19#c-19) Sí, no les dejemos participar en Eurovisión... ah, no, que no va a ser esta vez\nEste año es para no perderse el evento (la fase de votaciones, que las canciones da igual, son todas una pu*a 💩 ).\nA ver el blanqueo que se hará por país a través del jurado hacia Israel y la pasta que se dejarán los judíos en SMS en cada país para aupar el voto del público.",
