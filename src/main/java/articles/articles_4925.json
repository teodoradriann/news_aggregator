    "title": "New PFAS Testing Method Created",
    "text": "University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers have discovered a new way to detect per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water. This marks an important step forward in creating testing devices that are simpler, more cost-effective, faster and generally more accessible than existing methods.\nPFAS, the so-called forever chemicals, have been recognized as a concerning pollutant.\nThese chemicals persist in the environment because they resist breaking down and pose significant health threats. Exposure to these chemicals is linked to various cancers (including kidney, testicular, breast, ovarian, prostate, thyroid and childhood leukemia), liver and heart damage, and developmental damage to infants and children.\nEarlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the first-ever national safety standard for PFAS in drinking water at 4 ppt. \"PPT -- that means parts per trillion. That means in a trillion molecules in water, only 4 molecules are PFAS. And then we need to be able to detect even those few,\" explains Chang Liu, associate professor of biomedical engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Science Advances that describes their new method.\nThe gold standard for testing PFAS is currently liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. However, this method requires million-dollar equipment and complicated extraction steps. And, it is not portable. \"In addition, the stubborn persistence of PFAS residues can diminish the sensitivity of these instruments over time,\"says Xiaojun Wei, first author of the paper and research assistant professor at UMass Amherst.\n[Their study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adp8134) demonstrates that a small, inexpensive device is feasible for identifying various PFAS families and detecting PFAS at levels as low as 400 ppt. While this proof-of-concept stage invention does not reach the same level of sensitivity or the breadth of PFAS types that can be detected compared to mass spectrometry, the researchers see high potential for its impact.\n\"We're bringing the cost of the instrument from the scale of a million dollars to a few thousand,\" says Liu. \"We need better technology for detecting PFAS -- more accessible, more affordable and easier to use. And more testing that's on site. That's the motivation.\"\nThe researchers also see an application to use this method as a first-screening tool to identify the water that poses the greatest risks to human health.\nTheir testing device works by adding a molecule called cyclodextrin to a small device that is typically used for sequencing DNA, called a nanopore. The \"host-guest\" interaction between cyclodextrin and PFAS has been well documented, but Liu explains that no one had ever combined it with a nanopore for detection. \"Now we're using one of these molecules called HP-gamma-Cyclodextrin as an adapter in an alpha-Hemolysin nanopore,\" he says, effectively creating a PFAS detector.\nLiu hopes that their research will help raise awareness to the hazards of PFAS and eventually lead to a commercialized portable PFAS detector for water monitoring in the field.\n-Note: This news release was originally published by [the University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/new-pfas-testing-method-created-umass-amherst).

    "title": "Biden Team Asked About Him Taking Performance Enhancers, Response Raises Even More Questions – RedState",
    "text": "One of the big questions hanging out there for the CNN debate is whether Joe Biden will be taking or be given any performance enhancers to help him out. Now, the Biden team may have just added more fuel to that fire with their responses to direct questions on the matter. Fox News Digital reached out to the Biden campaign, the White House, and the Trump campaign to ask [ if the candidates have any plans to use performance-enhancing drugs for the debate.](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump) The Biden campaign twice avoided a direct answer to the question. \"Donald Trump is so scared of being held accountable for his toxic agenda of attacking reproductive freedom and cutting Social Security that he and his allies are resorting to desperate, obviously false lies,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told Fox News Digital on Wednesday evening. When asked in a follow-up email for a \"yes\" or \"no\" response, Hitt said her original statement answered the question. \"The accusation from Trump on drugs is a ‘desperate, obviously false lie,'\" Hitt added. The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. In contrast, when former President Donald Trump's team was asked a direct \"yes or no\" question, they responded, \"Absolutely not.\" Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt added: \"President Trump has naturally elite stamina and doesn't need performance-enhancing drugs, unlike Joe Biden, who many are saying will be drugged up for the debate like he was at the State of the Union. President Trump has repeatedly asked Joe Biden to participate in drug testing. What does Team Biden have to hide?\" It says a lot when they won't give a simple \"no\" to the direct question and they refuse to clarify the issue by taking a test, when they know the issue is out there. The NY Post [outlined things](https://nypost.com/2024/06/26/us-news/why-trumps-claim-that-biden-will-be-on-drugs-for-cnn-debate-isnt-far-fetched/) one could take/be given that could enhance performance--from peptide infusions to help clarity, Adderall to help focus, Botox to deal with sweating, and even B12 shots for energy. Biden hasn't spoken, standing alone on a stage for [more than 30 minutes](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/most-biden-rally-appearances-shorter-than-sitcom-helping-fuel-stamina-concerns) during his 11 rallies in 2024 except for three times, and those were just a couple of minutes longer. There's a continuing question about his ability and his coherence level. The Biden team and the media want to call the videos that reveal the problem \"cheap fakes,\" but the problem for them is that they're real and they can't be argued away. But hey, as we noted, he's been practicing standing for 90 minutes during his debate prep. So maybe he'll be able to do that. That's the low bar for him, and the liberal media will probably cheer that and call him the winner if he doesn't fall off the stage. That's where we're at, at this point. It promises to be an interesting show. Buckle up, and hang on for the ride.

    "text": "Status: 03.01.2024, 18:30 PM\nBy: Christine Merk\nCommentsPrint Share\nTo be completed in 2024: The cycle path from Thalham to Kleinpienzenau. It is the first section of a connection that will eventually run from Weyarn to Miesbach. © Max Kalup\nThe year 2024 will be a challenging one for Weyarn – certainly for the employees at the town hall. Around 60 projects are on the to-do list. Some of them mean big steps for the community.\nWeyarn – When Mayor Leonhard Wöhr lists what was done in 2023, it's an impressive list. In addition, the municipal council and administration have laid the foundation stone for important projects that are well advanced or even completed in 2024. An excerpt:\nCycle path to Miesbach At the beginning of September, the symbolic ground-breaking ceremony for a section of a long-awaited cycle path from Weyarn to the district town took place. This first part of the entire trail is in the middle, it leads from Thalham to Kleinpienzenau. The municipality of Weyarn is acting as the client, the Rosenheim State Building Authority is paying the costs. The section will be completed in the spring. Mayor Wöhr is already in negotiations with property owners on whose land the routes for the section from Thalham to Weyarn could be located. \"I hope that we can create the conditions for the cycle path to continue successfully,\" he says.\nAssisted living Two houses will be built to the south of the Alter Wirt, which will house residential groups for senior citizens, among other things. The Free State of Bavaria has already pledged funding. In the first quarter of 2024, the project will enter the \"hot phase\", Wöhr announces, which means finalising the land-use planning, contractually agreeing with the owner and finding a sponsor.\nAgri-PV systems Two agri-PV plants on a total area of 10.7 hectares are to be built west of Kleinpienzenau and will produce up to 75 percent of the electricity consumed in Weyarn in the future: more than ten megawatt hours. The facilities will not be visible from the state road. The development plan will be finalised in 2024. The municipality wants to have the participation of the municipal company or citizens examined.\nStudent Supervision From 2024, the new Childcare Act will come into force, which will gradually oblige municipalities to offer all-day care for all primary school children. In September, a separate committee was set up to deal with the issue. \"In 2024, we want to develop a concept for how the whole thing can be managed,\" says Wöhr. In doing so, he also directs his gaze in the direction of the neighbouring community of Feldkirchen-Westerham. Weyarn is a member of the school association there and is therefore also financially affected by the measures there.\nMy news Burglars rummage through Warngau single-family house and loot weapons - drunk (26) drives traffic sign around Read\nDriver still wanted to swerve – New Year's Eve rocket explodes under moving car reading\nOutlook for the year Holzkirchen: Setting the course for a new living spaceRead\nPerfect interaction: This is what Alpine Christmas feeling sounds like\nNew Year's Eve rocket shoots from house at moving car – and explodes right underneath\nRestless New Year's Eve for the police: 23-year-old shoots pyrotechnics with a gun read\nProperties The municipality has acquired a building on Erlacher Weg. It must be renovated before it can be used. \"We are currently in the planning phase to find space for several residential units,\" explains Wöhr. He hopes that there will also be subsidies for this.\nBroadband expansion The municipality has commissioned an analysis of the current situation. It is intended to clarify where there is still a need in the area municipality and whether an improvement would be financially feasible at all. The final decision lies with the municipal council. However, Wöhr already makes it clear: \"If there are no more subsidies, then it will be difficult to continue anything here.\"\nMoney and resources Like the broadband expansion, other projects in Weyarn are also dependent on grants. One of them is the expansion of the local heating network. \"We need government subsidies for this,\" says Wöhr. With regard to the Free State, he is pleased that no cuts have yet been announced; however, he is concerned about the federal government's budget freeze. \"As long as we don't have planning security, we're up in the air - and that doesn't just affect municipalities, but also private individuals.\" Keywords: municipal heat planning or energy-efficient renovation. In any case, the homework booklet will challenge the municipality financially and in terms of personnel. \"The municipal council has to make the decisions to use the available resources in a targeted manner.\"\nAbout this series\nThe turn of the year offers an opportunity for an outlook: Which projects will be tackled or implemented in the district and its municipalities in 2024? Where might the cutbacks need to be made? We'll give you an overview.",

    "text": "After the Nigeria Police Force apprehended three suspects responsible for the spread of counterfeit websites offering Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board registrations and fake JAMB admission letters, an official statement was released by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi.\nIn April, a warning was issued by the Nigeria Police Force and JAMB cautioning against individuals using phony websites to deceive candidates applying for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.\nA partnership between the Nigeria Police Force National Cyber Crime Centre and JAMB was announced to crack down on phishing websites and scammers.\nDuring a joint press conference at the Force Headquarters, Louis Edet House, Abuja, the police and JAMB highlighted that the fraudulent sites were designed to trick unsuspecting candidates into divulging personal information such as registration numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers, which were then exploited for malicious purposes.\nAccording to Adejobi’s statement titled “Police Unveil Threat Actors Behind Falsification of Thousands of Fake JAMB Admission Letters, Arrests 3, Recovers 4 Fake Domain, Website,” the perpetrators behind these unlawful activities have been apprehended.\nThe Inspector General of Police, Olukayode Egbetokun, reiterated the NPF’s commitment to ensuring the safety and security of citizens both physically and in cyberspace.\nThe statement explained, “Following the prior press briefing by the Nigeria Police Force and the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, reassuring the public of their efforts to eliminate the suspects responsible for the proliferation of various fake websites for JAMB registration and the falsification of fake JAMB admission letters, the NPF-NCCC has arrested three suspects in connection with the conspiracy involving Computer Related Forgery and System Interference, as per sections 8, 13, and 27 of the Cybercrimes Act, 2015 as amended.\nThe statement further revealed, “The suspects, including Effa Leonard Mpama, Ibang Ernest Jerome, and Eshiet Odotukana Benson, were part of a syndicate that illegally accessed JAMB’s Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) and e-facility. They manipulated admission letters and inputted fake details to secure admissions into tertiary institutions, sabotaging the JAMB admission process.\n“Upon interrogation, the suspects divulged their varying degrees of involvement, corroborating the existing evidence. Effa Leonard Mpama and Ibang Ernest Jerome collected personal details of prospective candidates and forwarded them to Eshiet Odotukana Benson, who obtained CAPS links from associates at JAMB Computer Based Test Centers. These associates, Daniel and Chris, still at large, operated in CBT centers in Calabar, Cross River State.”\nForensic analysis played a crucial role in uncovering an Imo State-based syndicate responsible for creating fake domains and associated websites.\n“Furthermore, digital forensic analysis led to the discovery of 4 fake domains and websites linked to a syndicate in Imọ State. Eshiet, possessing CAPS links, would modify the e-facility at any CBT center by using a candidate’s login details to create a fake admission letter,” the statement noted.\nEmphasizing the severity of such criminal partnerships and similar illegal activities, Egbetokun praised the Nigeria Police Force National Cybercrime Center for its dedication to safeguarding Nigerian citizens both physically and in the digital realm.\nIt was asserted that the suspects would face legal charges once the investigations were completed.",

    "text": "The San Antonio Spurs announced Thursday that star rookie Victor Wembanyama will miss the remainder of the 2024-25 NBA season due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder.\nThe rare condition, which involves a blood clot restricting blood flow in the affected area, was discovered after Wembanyama returned to San Antonio from the NBA All-Star Game. Treatment typically involves blood-thinning medication, which makes participation in contact sports like basketball unsafe.\nSpurs Optimistic About Full Recovery Despite the shocking and abrupt end to his rookie season, Spurs officials remain hopeful that Wembanyama will make a full recovery in time for the 2025-26 season. A team source told ESPN that there is no long-term concern about his health, and the focus is on his safety and ensuring a full return.\nSocial Media Speculation Surrounding Vaccine Links Following the announcement of Wembanyama’s blood clot diagnosis, social media was flooded with theories linking his condition to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, medical experts and analysts quickly debunked these claims, reiterating that there is no scientific evidence connecting vaccinations to deep vein thrombosis.\nRELATED: Victor Wembanyama’s Giant Hand Stuns Fans in Jaw-Dropping Photo with Allie LaForce\nVictor Wembanyama should sue the vaccine company that made the clot shot AND the NBA pic.twitter.com/J5zuY35XU1\n— The Washington Redskins {Kaisar}?||?

(@RedskinsOnSol) February 20, 2025 Victor Wembanyama, Covid Vaccine,TikTok, go go go!!! pic.twitter.com/tKos8NRDrt\n— Faith & Works (@faithANDworks99) February 20, 2025 Finally someone asking the right question\nSide effects of the covid jab are blood clots and thrombosis\nDefinitely possible that Wembanyama's deep vein thrombosis is due to the vaccine https://t.co/8ASCIoYPBi\n— Dan Gernez (@GernezDan) February 20, 2025 Health professionals emphasized that blood clots can form due to a variety of factors, including genetics, injuries, dehydration, prolonged travel, and underlying medical conditions. The Spurs have not provided details on what may have contributed to Wembanyama’s diagnosis but stated they will issue updates as appropriate.\nWembanyama’s Historic Rookie Season Cut Short The reigning Rookie of the Year and first-time NBA All-Star was having a sensational debut campaign, averaging:\n24.3 points per game 11.0 rebounds per game 3.7 assists per game 3.8 blocks per game (leading the NBA) His unique combination of offensive firepower and defensive dominance had already placed him in elite company. Wembanyama had taken 403 three-pointers and blocked 176 shots, a statistical feat never before accomplished in NBA history—and he did it before the All-Star break.\nUnfortunately, due to falling short of the league’s new 65-game minimum rule, Wembanyama will be ineligible for major end-of-season awards, including:\nDefensive Player of the Year (where he was a heavy favorite) All-NBA Team selections All-Defensive Team honors Prior to the injury, ESPN BET had Wembanyama as a -2000 favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year, making his absence a huge shake-up in the award race.\nTeammates React to Crushing News The Spurs locker room was visibly shaken following the announcement, as Wembanyama had become not just the focal point of the team’s future but also a beloved figure among his teammates.\nVeteran point guard Chris Paul, who was brought in to mentor Wembanyama, expressed the team’s disappointment while reinforcing that his long-term health is the priority.\n“It’s tough. Tough more than anything, I think, for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play.”\nPaul also acknowledged the massive void Wembanyama’s absence creates, both on and off the court.\n“I think everybody understands that basketball is what we do and not who we are. Life and everything is so much more important. But for us, we know losing a big part of our team like that is [made up for] by committee. And trust me, you can’t replace Vic. I can’t stand on a guy’s shoulders and block every shot that comes to the rim.”\n“Aside from his basketball ability, his charisma and what he brings into the locker room I think is what we’ll miss the most.”\nA Tough Season for the Spurs Wembanyama’s season-ending diagnosis marks the second major loss for the Spurs this year. In November 2024, head coach Gregg Popovich suffered a stroke, forcing him to take an indefinite leave from coaching.\nThe Spurs, currently sitting 23-29 and 12th in the Western Conference, were already struggling before Wembanyama’s injury. His absence for the final stretch of the season all but ensures they will miss the playoffs as they shift focus to next year’s rebuild.\nThis never happened before the vax! ? pic.twitter.com/WoykcCWVEV\n— TMSPN.com (@sportsgossip) February 20, 2025 Looking Ahead For now, Wembanyama’s health and full recovery remain the top priority. While his record-breaking rookie season was cut short, his impact has already been felt across the league, and San Antonio remains committed to building its future around him.\nThe NBA world will now wait to see if the 7-foot-3 sensation can return stronger next season—and if his absence reshapes the league’s defensive hierarchy in his wake.",

    "text": "Messungen im letzten Monat zeigen bis zu 16 Hitzetage über 30 Grad in Wiener Klassenzimmern - Umweltschutzorganisation fordert Sofortprogramm vom Bund für klimafitte Gebäude\nGreenpeace und die Universität für Bodenkultur (BOKU) zeigen: In Wiener Klassenzimmern wird es zu heiß. Die Ergebnisse von Messungen aus dem Gymnasium Maroltingergasse im 16. Bezirk sind alarmierend: Seit 27. Mai wurden an 25 Tagen über 27 Grad in den Klassenzimmern gemessen. An bis zu 16 Tagen war es während des Unterrichts je nach Raum sogar über 30 Grad heiß. Neben der Schule untersucht die Umweltschutzorganisation über den gesamten Sommer zusammen mit der BOKU im Rahmen eines groß angelegten Hitzemonitorings, wie stark sich Innenräume in Wien aufheizen. Greenpeace fordert ein Sofortprogramm vom Bund für hitzetaugliche Schulen – inklusive Sanierungen, außenliegende Beschattung und modernen Lüftungsanlagen. Die Live-Daten aus den Schulklassen und Wiener Wohnungen sind unter act.gp/HitzeDashboard einsehbar.\nHerbert Formayer, Professor am Institut für Meteorologie an der BOKU: „Die Durchschnittstemperatur in Österreich liegt bereits um 3,1 Grad über dem vorindustriellen Niveau. Der Großteil der Erwärmung erfolgte seit den 1980er Jahren. Viele österreichische Schulen sind deutlich früher und damit unter anderen Bedingungen gebaut worden. In Klassenzimmern ohne entsprechende Maßnahmen gegen Überhitzung wie in der Maroltingergasse spitzt sich die Situation prekär zu. Gleichzeitig ist es keine Option, die Fenster untertags geschlossen und die Hitze draußen zu halten - bereits innerhalb von 20 Minuten steigt der CO₂-Gehalt ohne Lüftung auf unzumutbare Werte.”\nElisabeth Gutenberg, Direktorin des GRG 16 Maroltingergasse: „Wir sehen jedes Jahr, wie schwierig der Unterricht in den warmen Monaten für Schülerinnen und Schüler, aber auch für unser Lehrpersonal wird. Teilweise sind die Klassenräume so aufgeheizt, dass Kinder Kreislaufprobleme bekommen. Wir brauchen dringend Unterstützung vom Bund, um unser Schulgebäude an die veränderten Bedingungen anzupassen.“\nJasmin Duregger, Klima- und Energieexpertin bei Greenpeace in Österreich: „Wenn es in Klassenzimmern 30 Grad hat, leidet nicht nur die Konzentration, sondern auch die Chancengleichheit. So kann kein Kind in Österreich gut lernen. Die Bundesregierung muss endlich handeln und genug Budget und Ressourcen bereitstellen, um Schulen vor Hitze zu schützen - mit Sanierungen, außenliegender Beschattung und modernen Lüftungssystemen. Hitzeschutz in Schulen ist kein Luxus, sondern eine notwendige Maßnahme für Bildungsgerechtigkeit – und ein wirksamer Beitrag zum Klimaschutz.”\nEin Blick auf den 13. Juni 2025 zeigt exemplarisch, wie belastend die Situation im Schulalltag ist. Bereits zu Unterrichtsbeginn um acht Uhr lag die Temperatur im Klassenzimmer bei rund 28 Grad – und blieb den gesamten Schultag über auf diesem hohen Niveau. Trotz einer Außentemperatur von maximal 25 Grad heizte sich der Raum bis zum Abend auf 32,5 Grad auf. Auch die CO₂-Werte sind besorgniserregend. Schon um 9:20 Uhr und erneut um 9:40 Uhr überschritt der CO₂-Wert im Klassenzimmer die kritische Marke von 1400 ppm, bei der Lüften dringend erforderlich ist. Ohne frische Luft sinkt die Konzentrationsfähigkeit deutlich, doch Lüften bedeutet: noch mehr Hitze. Greenpeace fordert von der Bundesregierung ein Sofortprogramm für hitzetaugliche Schulen. Um den extremen Temperaturen zu entgegnen, muss die Regierung langfristige, energieschonende Lösungen mit intelligenter Belüftung, Sanierung und Beschattung gewährleisten.\nÜbersicht der wichtigsten Messdaten der Schule: act.gp/BOKU_Hitzemessungen_Schule\nGreenpeace Online-Dashboard zu den Messungen: act.gp/HitzeDashboard\nFotos der Temperaturmessungen in der Schule: act.gp/HitzeSchule\nRückfragen & Kontakt\nJasmin Duregger\nKlima- und Energieexpertin\nGreenpeace in Österreich\nTel: +43 (0) 664 840 38 03\nE-Mail: jasmin.duregger@greenpeace.org\nAnnette Stolz\nPressesprecherin\nGreenpeace in Österreich\nTel.: + 43 (0) 664 612 67 25\nE-Mail: annette.stolz@greenpeace.org\nOTS-ORIGINALTEXT PRESSEAUSSENDUNG UNTER AUSSCHLIESSLICHER INHALTLICHER VERANTWORTUNG DES AUSSENDERS - WWW.OTS.AT | GRP",
