    "title": "If you want to keep your mind razor sharp as you get older, say goodbye to these 7 habits",
    "text": "It’s an uphill battle that’s as challenging, if not more so, than a heartbreak:\nYou’ve always prided yourself on your mental agility, your quick wit, and the ease with which you soak up new knowledge. But it seems like lately, that spark is just not snapping as it used to.\nYou’ve given it a shot, tried to shake off the brain fog and stay mentally active, but it’s not quite working out.\nSometimes there aren’t any dramatic signs.\nIt’s just this nagging notion that if you want to maintain your cognitive sharpness as you age, some things in your lifestyle might need to change, even when every fiber of your being resists it.\nHere’s how to identify those lifestyle choices that are secretly sabotaging your mental agility.\nBelow is the guide to the 7 habits you need to bid farewell to if you wish to keep your mind razor sharp as you get older. It’s not going to be easy, but hey, who said that mind yoga was a walk in the park?\n1) Ignoring regular physical activity It’s akin to trying to keep a fire going without feeding it any fuel.\nYou’ve always enjoyed the mental challenge, the thrill of a good debate, or solving that complex problem. But lately, it feels like your mental prowess is not what it used to be.\nAnd while you’re striving to keep your mind sharp, you’ve overlooked the fact that physical well-being and mental agility are intrinsically linked.\nSure, it’s easier to sit on that comfy couch instead of hitting the gym or going for a brisk walk – but at what cost?\nPhysical activity is not just about maintaining an appealing physique or keeping the doctor away. It plays a significant role in boosting your brain health too.\nIf you’re not engaging in regular exercise, it’s like starving your brain of the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function optimally.\nA sedentary lifestyle can be an unsuspecting saboteur of your cognitive sharpness as you age. And if this sounds all too familiar, then it’s high time to get moving.\n2) Neglecting a healthy diet It’s like trying to run a high-performance car on low-grade fuel.\nAs someone who has always been more interested in the world of thoughts and ideas than in the culinary arts, I often found myself grabbing whatever was quickest and easiest when it came to meals.\nFast food, takeout, ready-to-eat meals – you name it, I’ve had it. Convenience was king and nutrition, an afterthought.\nBut then I noticed the impact on my mental sharpness. I was slower, foggy, and struggled to maintain my usual mental stamina.\nResearch says that what we eat significantly affects our brain health. Our brain needs the right nutrients to work optimally, just like the rest of our body.\nAnd it makes sense, doesn’t it? Only when I started paying attention to what I was eating – fresh fruits, lean proteins, whole grains – did I notice a difference. My thought process became clearer, the fog lifted and I was back in the game.\n3) Shunning social interactions It’s like living in a lush forest but refusing to breathe in its fresh air.\nA wise man once said, “There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship,” Thomas Aquinas.\nI always held this quote close to my heart, but I never truly understood the full breadth of its meaning until I found myself isolating from my social circles. As an introvert, I’ve always enjoyed my solitude, my space. But then I noticed a certain sluggishness in my thoughts, a dullness that wasn’t there before.\nTurns out, Aquinas was onto something because research indicates that social interactions are crucial for cognitive health. Just as a muscle needs exercise to stay strong, our brains need social interactions to stay sharp.\nBeing socially active promotes a sense of belonging, reduces stress and stimulates our minds. It keeps us mentally engaged and challenges us in ways we might not realize.\n4) Overindulging in screen time It’s like trying to maintain a vibrant garden while constantly pouring salt water on it.\nDid you know that the average American adult spends more than 11 hours a day interacting with media, including television, smartphones and computers?\nI was no different. I used to spend hours scrolling through social media, binge-watching TV shows, or glued to my computer for work. It seemed harmless, just a way to unwind or stay connected.\nBut then, I started noticing my focus waning, my thoughts scattering easily. A quick research led me to understand the potential harm of excessive screen time on our cognitive health.\nToo much screen time can lead to decreased physical activity, disrupted sleep patterns and increased stress levels – all of which are bad news for our brain health.\nIf you’re serious about keeping your mind sharp as you age, it might be time to reconsider how much time you’re spending in front of screens.\n5) Skimping on sleep\nIt’s like trying to run a marathon with a heavy weight tied to your ankle.\nI’ve been there – burning the midnight oil, convincing myself that sleep was overrated, that I could function just fine on a few hours. It began as a way to squeeze in more work, more leisure, more of everything into my day.\nBut then, the inevitable happened. My mind felt sluggish, my memory was not as sharp, and my creativity seemed to be on a permanent vacation.\nSleep is not just about resting our bodies. It’s when our brain gets to work – processing information, forming memories and rejuvenating itself.\nDepriving yourself of adequate sleep is like denying your brain its much-needed downtime.\nEmbrace the power of good sleep and say goodbye to those late nights. It might mean missing out on some late-night TV or that midnight snack, but trust me, your brain will thank you for it.\n6) Not embracing new learning It’s like owning a high-performance sports car but refusing to take it out for a spin.\nI’ve always been a creature of habit, comfortably settled in my routines and my knowledge base. Taking on new learning felt like a daunting task. Why fix what’s not broken, right?\nBut then, I noticed a lack of flexibility in my thinking, a rigidity that wasn’t there before.\nOur brains are designed to learn and adapt. It’s how we evolved as a species. When we stop learning, we’re essentially denying our brains the exercise it needs to stay fit and sharp .\nWhether it’s picking up a new language, learning to play a musical instrument or mastering a new technology, new learning challenges our brains, keeps it active and enhances its cognitive abilities.\n7) Avoiding mindfulness practices It’s like living next to a serene lake but never taking time to sit by the waterside and soak in the tranquillity.\nI used to think mindfulness was some sort of new-age fad, not something that could genuinely benefit my mental health. My life was always about rushing from one task to another, never truly being in the moment.\nBut then, I noticed my attention span dwindling, my stress levels escalating and my mind constantly buzzing with thoughts.\nMindfulness is not just about meditation or yoga. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the task at hand and quieting our monkey minds.\nPracticing mindfulness can improve our focus, reduce stress and enhance our cognitive abilities. It’s like a workout for our minds that keeps it sharp and agile.\nThe final takeaway Change doesn’t happen overnight. It takes consistent effort and mindfulness. But remember, each small step towards a healthier lifestyle contributes to better brain health.\nJust as philosopher René Descartes said , “It is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well.” And using our minds well starts with taking care of them.\nSo embark on this journey towards a sharper mind with patience and kindness towards yourself. Celebrate the small victories and don’t hesitate to seek support when needed.\nWith time, these healthy habits will become second nature, and you’ll be well on your way to maintaining a razor-sharp mind as you age.",

    "text": "Following strong start to the season, Colorado’s snowpack risks dropping below normal if incoming storms don’t deliver The Rocky Mountains likely won’t see deep snow totals between now and Christmas, but the state is only a quarter of the way through its snowpack season News | Dec 13, 2024\nSkiers head up the Kicking Horse lift on a snow-covered morning at Granby Ranch on Nov. 27, the ski area's earliest opening day on record. Since then, a lack of snow threatens to bring the state's snowpack below normal for this time of year.\nMeg Soyars Van Hauen/Sky-Hi News An early season surge in Colorado’s snowpack has dramatically slowed amid a prolonged dry spell . If incoming storms over the next week don’t deliver, experts say snowpack levels could drop below normal.\nSnowpack is tracked by looking at the snow-water equivalent, a measurement that shows how much liquid water is held within the state’s snowfields.\nFollowing its progress through the winter and spring helps provide insight into the strength of the season’s runoff and what it means for the health of the state’s reservoirs and drought conditions.\n“It means having a good water supply for the year or several years. … Secondly, it can be a measure of how prone we are for wildfires the following year,” National Weather Service meteorologist Dave Barjenbruch said. “If we have a poor snowpack, that’s likely going to add more stress for trees and soil as we head into the summer.”\nSnowpack levels have climbed for much of the early season, aided by a routine cycle of heavy storms that helped ski areas open terrain at an accelerated pace, including Granby Ranch, which saw its earliest opening on record. That changed at the end of November when conditions dried and snowpack levels flatlined across the state.\nAs of Thursday, Dec. 12, statewide snowpack stood at 105% of the 30-year median. In the Colorado Headwaters River Basin, which encompasses the bulk of the state’s ski resorts, levels were slightly higher at 108%, according to data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service .\nThe region with the greatest snowpack remains the Arkansas River Basin in south-central Colorado, where levels stood at 144% and set a new seasonal record last month.\nThe black line shows snowpack trends for the current winter season compared to the 30-year median, shown in the green line. After major back-to-back storms during the week of Thanksgiving, Colorado’s snowpack has flattened amid mostly dry conditions. Natural Resources Conservation Service/Courtesy illustration Snowpack levels could remain mostly flat through Christmas and could even begin to approach historical lows, according to a projection by OpenSnow founding meteorologist Joel Gratz.\n“Our snowpack will stay at about the same number due to cool air and a low sun angle, or perhaps rise slightly due to upcoming weak storms,” Gratz wrote in a Wednesday blog post . “… However, our snowpack compared to the median will continue to decline during the next two weeks as we see little new snowfall and the median continues to increase.”\nHope for a resurgence is now riding on three projected storms, with the first set to hit during the day Friday.\nThat storm is likely to favor the northern and central mountains with 1-5 inches of snow accumulation possible. On Sunday, snowfall is anticipated to resume during the late afternoon and into the evening and could again bring up to 5 inches of snow to northern and central mountain areas.\nSnowfall may return again Wednesday, Dec. 18, though Gratz wrote he currently has “low confidence” in the forecast.\n“None of these three upcoming storms will bring significant snow, but little refreshes would be lovely,” Gratz wrote, adding that the longer-range forecast between now and Christmas will not be favorable.\n“The 15-day snow forecast tells the story, with more snow along the West Coast and less snow here in Colorado through the Rockies,” Gratz wrote.\nA forecast from the Climate Prediction Center shows an elevated chance for below-normal precipitation in Colorado between now and Christmas. “The 15-day snow forecast tells the story, with more snow along the West Coast and less snow here in Colorado through the Rockies,” OpenSnow founding meteorologist Joel Gratz wrote in a recent blog post. Climate Prediction Center/Courtesy illustration A three to four week outlook from the Climate Prediction Center shows equal chances for above- or below-normal precipitation in Colorado through early January, with as much as a 60% chance for above-normal temperatures .\nBarjenbruch said it’s common for the state to see dry periods throughout the winter, and it can take just one intense storm to bring snowpack levels back.\nThe recent surges in snowpack levels have been encouraging and will likely prove critical in the state’s ability to weather occasional bouts of dryer conditions, Barjenbruch said. The state is roughly a quarter of the way through its snowpack season, with over 100 days to go until levels reach the historical peak in April.\n“The big storms are where you can really add on, say maybe an inch or two of water across the entire state’s snowpack, and that’s a huge benefit,” Barjenbruch said, adding that January and February tend to bring some of the deepest snowstorms to mountain regions.\n“Those are the ones that really help out with building the snowpack and keeping our water resources available for the following years,” Barjenbruch said.\nLocal Following strong start to the season, Colorado’s snowpack risks dropping below normal if incoming storms don’t deliver Dec 13, 2024",
