    "title": "PM’s aide stresses on climate-resilient urban development - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam on Thursday said climate-resilient urban development would not only address immediate environmental challenges but also promote long-term sustainability, equity, and improve quality of life. Speaking at a meeting with the Chairman of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Muhammad Ali Randhawa, she emphasized that extreme weather such as heat waves and urban flooding, were increasingly jeopardizing the lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure in Pakistan’s cities. A statement issued by the climate change ministry said that she stressed that building climate resilience in urban areas was critical to making them sustainable, livable, and adaptable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Romina Alam outlined the country’s vulnerability to climate risks, noting that cities like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar face rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, and other climate-related threats. She said the climate and environmental ministries were implementing policies to foster sustainable urban environments, with a particular focus on building resilience against these threats while improving living conditions for residents. She stressed upon cities to become environmentally sustainable to mitigate the growing threats of climate change. In Islamabad, Ms Alam said efforts would focus on increasing green spaces and enhancing the city’s tree cover, making it a model for other cities aiming to achieve sustainability goals. She also addressed the health risks associated with climate change, particularly advocating for the relocation of paper mulberry trees to alleviate pollen allergies. The CDA chairman briefed Ms Alam about several urban development projects that include renewable energy initiatives, environmental health improvements, zero waste strategies, and sustainable transport systems. He also shared plans to create an extensive bicycle route network throughout Islamabad to promote eco-friendly commuting. The meeting concluded with a commitment to joint efforts between the climate ministry and CDA, particularly in afforestation projects across 700 acres near Bhara Kahu. Both parties agreed to prioritise these initiatives as essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing urban areas to withstand future climate challenges.

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "The holiday season brings with it Halloween festivities, a period of thanks, and Christmas cheer, along with new films and TV shows. The anticipation for Blockbuster movies builds up throughout the duration. “As we entered 2024, there had been much agonizing from theater owners and movie executives as to the future of cinema,” Steve Cypert, a local moviemaker, said. “Many people held their collective breaths and kept their fingers crossed. Would people still go to see movies in the theater? The answer didn't come until July and August. Out came ‘Inside Out 2,’ ‘Deadpool & Wolverine,’ ‘Despicable Me 4’, ‘Dune: Part Two,’ ‘Twisters,’ then finally, this September, ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.’ Theater owners could breathe easy again. People love going to the movies.” Christopher Coursey, a Cherokee County film director and producer, said he is looking forward to watching some movies that have already come out. Some of them are “Alien: Romulus,” released in August; “Deadpool & Wolverine,” from late July; and the “Beetlejuice” sequel, called “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” which was released in early September. Coursey said it has been a while since he has noticed a classic Christmas movie make an appearance on the big screens, but he has observed a lot of superhero and scary or thriller films showing up lately. “Some of it, I think, has to do with the [SAG-AFTRA] strike that went on last year, and it sort of put things behind,” Coursey siad. “It’ll probably be a year or so before things finally get back going, with all the writers who were on strike for that.” The SAG-AFTRA strikes are also why Coursey said movies sure to be hits, such as superhero films, are coming out in droves. Jeremy Scott, another local filmmaker, said he has not noticed any upcoming movies he believes will be especially good, other than “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” but he is looking forward to some TV shows. “The Penguin,” a TV mini-series on HBO following the events of the 2022 “The Batman,” is one Scott is hoping to see. Scott is also waiting for the next season of “The Last of Us” and the new “Daredevil: Born Again,” both of which will premiere in 2025. “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew” is another TV show, set to be released in December, that Scott is hoping to check out. Scott said he believes TV shows have been in a \"golden age\" for a while, and that will eventually start to drop off in quality. But he recently has been having a hard time finding interesting shows. “Right now, I think as far as the shows on TV, I’m struggling to find something that’s just captivating me to the point where I can’t wait for the next season,” Scott said. Cypert said October will be filled with drama and thriller movies, including a musical, “Joker: Folie à Deux”; “Venom: The Last Dance”; and “Conclave.” Cypert said the action/drama movie “Gladiator II” will debut in November. “What's Santa bringing? Well. There's ‘Kraven the Hunter’ and’ The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.’ Will one of those be a lump of coal? We'll see,” Cypert said. Cypert said the “odd” film he will be attending later this month is “Megalopolis,” a sci–fi/drama set to an architect rebuilding a utopia-like New York City after a disaster. Horror fans will have a slew of films to pick from, including “Bagman” in September. The month of spookiness, October, will feature “Things Will Be Different,” “The Unraveling,” “Terrifier 3,” and “Smile 2.” Cypert said November will also offer a horror genre movie called “Heretic.” Children’s films this year will feature a lot of animation, including September’s picks of “Transformers One” and “The Wild Robot.” Cypert said October’s movies made for kids will include “Piece by Piece,” “My Hero Academia: You’re Next,” and “Kensuke’s Kingdom.” “Moana 2” is what Cypert said will probably be a blowout in November, with “Hitpig” and “Overload: The Sacred Kingdom” to also make an appearance in theaters. “There are plenty of other genre films coming as well – drama, thriller, comedy, and documentary, you name it: ‘How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies,’ ‘The Substance,’ ‘What We Find on the Road,’ ‘Man vs. Phone,’ ‘Empire Waist,’ ‘She Taught Love,’ ‘White Bird,’ ‘The Forest Hills,’ ‘Detour 95,’ ‘Blitz,’ ‘A Real Pain,’ ‘Love Bomb,’ ‘Christmas Eve in Miller's Point,’ ‘Wicked,’ ‘Bonhoeffer: Pastor,’ ‘Spy,’ and ‘Assassin,’” Cypert said. “Best be saving up for the popcorn. It's gonna be wild.”",

    "title": "Preço de alimentos e juros contribuíram para frear inflação em 2023, dizem economistas",
    "text": "De acordo com os especialistas, a tendência é de que a inflação continue a cair (Tânia Rêgo/ Agência Brasil) O comportamento dos preços dos alimentos e a política monetária, que impôs juros altos na economia em 2023, foram fatores que ajudaram a inflação ficar controlada neste ano que termina. A avaliação é de especialistas ouvidos pela Agência Brasil, nesta quinta-feira (28), quando foram divulgados dois índices de inflação. O Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo 15 (IPCA-15), tido como a prévia da inflação oficial do país, fechou 2023 em 4,72%, o menor resultado dos últimos três anos. O dado é do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Calculado pela Fundação Getulio Vargas, o Índice Geral de Preços - Mercado (IGP-M) apresentou deflação no ano, ou seja, a média dos preços ficou em queda de 3,18%. O resultado marca uma inflexão do índice, que chegou a fechar 2020 em 23,14%. O ano de 2021 também ficou na casa de dois dígitos, 17,78%. Em 2022, sinalizou desaceleração, terminando em 5,45%. Fatores Para o economista e professor do Ibmec, Gilberto Braga, os números mostram acertos da política macroeconômica do governo e do Comitê de Política Monetária (Copom) do Banco Central (BC), responsável por ditar a taxa básica de juros da economia, a Selic. Ao longo do ano, a Selic foi mantida em patamares altos, como forma de desestimular a economia e, consequentemente, combater a inflação. O ano começou com taxa de 13,75% e, depois de quatro cortes seguidos no segundo semestre, encerra 2023 em 11,75% Braga destaca que há grupos de preços que ainda pressionam os índices. “Principalmente dos aluguéis, que vêm subindo mais do que a inflação média da economia”. Mas ressalta que “o preço dos alimentos, de uma forma geral, vêm caindo, o que vem contrabalançar de maneira positiva as pressões de aumento”. O professor do Ibmec espera manutenção da tendência para o próximo ano. “Para 2024, esse comportamento dos preços deve permanecer com a inflação tendendo a cair”. No entanto, Gilberto Braga aponta que há riscos vindo de fora do Brasil. “Pressão externa, sobretudo, por conta dos conflitos bélicos da Rússia com a Ucrânia e do Oriente Médio [ofensiva israelense na Faixa de Gaza], que influenciam os preços do petróleo, dos seguros e do livre fluxo de comércio internacional”, descreve. “A expectativa, apesar dessas ameaças, é bastante positiva para 2024”, completa. Commodities O pesquisador André Braz, do Instituto Brasileiro de Economia da Fundação Getulio Vargas (Ibre/FGV), aponta que um elemento que ajudou a moldar a inflação de 2023 foram os preços das commodities (matérias-primas básicas negociadas com preços internacionais) agrícolas e minerais. “Na parte agrícola, soja, milho e trigo, que são matéria-prima para vários outros alimentos, tiveram quedas muito fortes do preço ao produtor”. A soja, por exemplo, caiu 21,92%. No caso do milho, o recuo foi ainda maior, 30,02%. Braz explica que o comportamento do IGP-M representa uma “devolução” do choque inflacionário causado pela pandemia entre 2020 e 2022. “Dado as safras, que foram muito boas tanto no Brasil quanto em outros países produtores de grãos, a gente teve essa queda de preços muito grande. Então ajudou a compensar um pouco aquela fase de aumentos agudos”, explica. Apesar de o IGP-M divulgado nesta quinta-feira ser o menor já registrado para um ano fechado (-3,18%), Braz observa que o índice mostra uma tendência de aceleração. Em julho, o acumulado de queda em 12 meses era 7,72%. “Está acelerando, está ficando cada vez mais próximo de zero e vai migrar para um terreno positivo. Número negativo é algo incomum para o IGP-M porque, em condições normais, a trajetória desses preços é de alta”, contextualiza. Em dezembro o índice mensal ficou em 0,74%. IPCA Sobre o IPCA, Braz sinaliza que o resultado de 0,40% de dezembro ficou acima do esperado. A causa foi a concentração no mês de reajustes de preços controlados. “Vimos aumento de [taxa de] água e esgoto, energia, ônibus, trem e metrô em várias cidades do país”, lista. Ainda especificamente para o mês de dezembro, o economista da FGV interpreta que houve surpresa no preço de alguns alimentos, especialmente os de características sazonais. “Não foi um aumento generalizado, foi um aumento sazonal, produtos que normalmente têm uma oferta menor no verão, cuja oferta é prejudicada pelo clima, como produtos de feira livre. Por exemplo, hortaliças, legumes e frutas vieram inflados em função desse clima mais hostil”. Outra influência foi a alimentação fora de casa. “Nesse período de festas e de férias, as famílias costumam comer em restaurantes, lanchonetes, então os preços do menu normalmente sobem pela demanda”. Apesar dessa sinalização em dezembro, Braz salienta que, ao longo do ano, o preço dos alimentos teve um comportamento positivo para a economia brasileira, contribuindo para que a inflação oficial ficasse abaixo do esperado no início do ano, quando o mercado estimava o IPCA perto de 5,5%. O IPCA-15 mostrou que o grupo alimentos e bebidas subiu 0,83% em 2023. “É muito pouco frente a uma inflação média de 4,72%. Em termos reais, a alimentação não subiu de preço. Isso foi bom porque a alimentação compromete mais o orçamento de famílias de menor renda e, por conta disso, você tem espaço para que essas famílias consumam outras coisas \", diz. O IPCA fechado do mês de dezembro e do ano 2023 será divulgado no dia 11 de janeiro. Braz estima que o número seja perto de 4,45%. Se concretizado esse patamar, estaria dentro da meta do Banco Central, 3,25%, com intervalo de tolerância de 1,5 ponto percentual para cima ou para baixo, ou seja, o limite superior é de 4,75%. Para 2024 Já para o ano que vem, assim como Gilberto Braga, do Ibmec, que tem uma visão otimista, Braz espera um IPCA fechando 2024 por volta de 4%. No entanto, também enxerga desafios, como a guerra entre Rússia e Ucrânia e a ofensiva israelense contra o Hamas. André Braz acrescenta ainda outro fator de preocupação: o El Niño, fenômeno climático que modifica a temperatura das águas do oceano pacífico e impacta safras em diversas regiões do planeta. “Da mesma forma que vai afetar os preços ao produtor no IGP-M, vai afetar os preços ao consumidor também, é um repasse. Isso pode ser o desafio para o ano que vem”. No cenário interno, Braz cita que a política fiscal do governo, ou seja, o montante de gastos públicos, pode intervir no comportamento da inflação, caso haja dúvidas de o governo não cumprir a meta orçamentária. O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, diz buscar déficit zero em 2024. “Se essa meta fica ameaçada, pode haver uma desvalorização do câmbio [frente ao dólar], e essa desvalorização causa inflação porque a gente passa a importar as coisas a um preço maior”, explica. Juros O economista do Ibre avalia que a política de juros do BC cumpriu, em 2023, o papel de debelar a inflação. Mas ressalta que a Selic em 11,75% ainda é muito alta, o que a torna um desafio para o crescimento do país, geração de emprego e renda. Mesmo com os desafios citados, Braz acredita que a inflação seguirá uma trajetória controlada o suficiente para permitir mais quedas na taxa básica de juros. “Acho que o BC vai ter condições de continuar cortando [a taxa] ainda que existam esses desafios no radar. É provável que a Selic termine o ano que vem, quem sabe, em torno de 9%”, acredita. Leia mais",

    "text": "ROMA\n(ANSA) - ROMA, 13 DIC - Arriva un'intensa perturbazione meteo che segnerà questo venerdì 13 dicembre. Nelle prossime ore le precipitazioni interesseranno soprattutto il Mar Tirreno, ma poi bagneranno già in mattinata il lungo settore che corre dalla Liguria alla Campania; nel corso del pomeriggio, i fenomeni scavalcheranno l'Appennino raggiungendo anche Marche, Abruzzo, Molise e nord Puglia, ma la giornata sarà nuvolosa e grigia quasi ovunque salvo al Nord e in particolare sulle Alpi. E' la previsione di Antonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it. Il weekend sarà poi all'insegna di una medaglia a due facce: il sabato sarà ancora un po' perturbato, la domenica risulterà in prevalenza soleggiata. E' confermato, infatti, che la nuova perturbazione sarà rapida e porterà fenomeni diffusi solo fino al pomeriggio di sabato 14; in seguito si registreranno residui addensamenti sul versante tirrenico in spostamento la domenica verso il Sud, dove si fermeranno un po' più a lungo. La prossima settimana, infine, vedrà l'espansione dell'Anticiclone delle Azzorre verso l'Italia con condizioni stabili, asciutte e più soleggiate ovunque. Le temperature saliranno in modo deciso in montagna, il cielo sarà sereno ed il sole sarà presente più al lungo nel pomeriggio (tramonterà più tardi): \"Tutte buone notizie - afferma Sanò - per scacciare i fantasmi della giornata di oggi, della parascevedecatriafobia, ovvero la paura di questo venerdì 13 grigio e perturbato\". Nel dettaglio: Venerdì 13. Al Nord: nubi, piovaschi e nebbie. Al Centro: peggiora diffusamente sulle regioni peninsulari. Al Sud: piogge forti in arrivo specie sulla Campania. Sabato 14. Al Nord: molte nubi. Al Centro: piogge sparse sulle Tirreniche. Al Sud: piogge e rovesci. Domenica 15. Al Nord: soleggiato. Al Centro: piovaschi in Molise. Al Sud: instabile su Gargano e basso Tirreno. Tendenza: prossima settimana con l'Anticiclone delle Azzorre.

    "title": "MT Greene tells conservative Christian women to be \"modest\" and not tempt their \"Christian brothers\"",
    "text": "Taking a break from ignoring her day job, Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted a warning to Christian women to stop tempting Christian men. It seems that she is a proponent of the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Greene believes women can aspire to exemplary morality, but they are shameless Jezebels at heart. Her view of her sex must be engendered by the company she keeps. How delightfully biblical. She also adopts the exculpatory, fundamentalist, religious belief that men are not responsible for sexual sins. Maturity is supposed to give men self-control. And many men take responsibility for their behavior. On the other hand, Christian men — or at least the ones Greene hangs with at the gym and in Congress — apparently lack the maturity for self-regulation and must rely on women to be the adults in the room. To start her tweet, Greene acknowledges that what she is about to say is stupid — although she armors herself against the expected and deserved scorn by anticipating it. \"This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.\" \"This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.\" She then gets to the meat of the matter and the subject of her advice — consequential women who lack the agency to make their own decisions and instead conform to a global push to reduce women to objects. \"There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women.\" \"There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women.\" In case you missed the point, she repeats and expands on it. \"If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don’t have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time.\" \"If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don’t have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time.\" This advice raises the question: Is Greene practicing what she preaches? It is a rhetorical question. I will not comment on Greene’s looks — beauty is in the of the beholder — but I wonder which of her fashion choices and behaviors could be considered “modest.” She is fond of showing off her armpits. Yelling like a fish-wife during the State of the Union. Chasing down and berating the survivors of school massacres. Calling her female colleagues “little bitch.” And showing porno in Congress. She then says that women adopting the demure, shrinking-violet persona she recommends, will experience an immediate increase in respect from men. Because women being quiet served them so well for so long. \"Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification.\" \"Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification.\" She then reiterates her admonishment to women that it is their responsibility to ensure men keep it in their pants. \"It’s also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble. As conservative Christian women let us always be an example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.\" \"It’s also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble. As conservative Christian women let us always be an example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.\" She must be talking from experience, as she was once — I have no data on whether she still is — a seductress leading decent men astray. Just ask the polyamorous tantric sex guru Craig Ivey and gym manager Justin Tway. Two men who, through no fault of their own, were sucked into an adulterous sewer of lust, libido, and lifting. Poor dears. Greene is not known for her grasp of reality. But for her to think she has the moral standing, history, expertise, or common sense to lecture others on how to behave is low even for her. But looking like a fool has never slowed her roll. She ends with a dollar-store aphorism — it beats having an original thought. \"Be the light, don’t fall into the darkness.\" \"Be the light, don’t fall into the darkness.\" Allow me to translate that from Greenish to English. “Don’t be like me.” Here is the tweet: This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women.If you are…— Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸 (@mtgreenee) February 22, 2024 This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women.If you are…",
