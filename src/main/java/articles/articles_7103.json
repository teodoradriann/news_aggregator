Championship leader Max Verstappen was the fastest. Antonelli's crash halted the session, but team principal Toto Wolff assured that he was fine. Mercedes aims to have the car ready for the next session. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 30-08-2024 18:49 IST | Created: 30-08-2024 18:49 IST Italian teenager Kimi Antonelli, who's anticipated to take over from Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes next season, experienced a dramatic crash on his Formula One practice debut at the Italian Grand Prix, Friday. Meanwhile, Red Bull's Max Verstappen set the fastest time. Verstappen, the current championship leader and two-time Monza winner, clocked in 0.228 seconds quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on a sunny afternoon near Milan. McLaren's Lando Norris, Verstappen's closest competitor, secured the third-fastest time but remains 70 points behind in the standings. Antonelli, who just turned 18, brought the session to an early stop 10 minutes in when his Mercedes spun out at high-speed Parabolica and crashed into the barriers. Stepping in for George Russell, the teenager had initially set a promising pace. Team boss Toto Wolff reassured, saying, \"Kimi, all good,\" as Antonelli walked away unharmed. The car was taken back for repairs, aiming to be ready for the second session later on Friday. (With inputs from agencies.)

La falta de grandes lluvias desde el invierno de 2020-2021, una larga sequía únicamente atenuada por el medio millón de metros cúbicos que aportó la [tormenta tropical Hermine](https://www.laprovincia.es/sociedad/2022/09/27/tormenta-hermine-dejo-canarias-80-75962009.html) en septiembre de 2022, ha ido disminuyendo las reservas de las principales presas de la Cumbre, especialmente las situadas en la mitad sur de Gran Canaria. Los embalses de Soria y [Fataga](/tags/fataga/) están totalmente vacíos, mientras que los de Chira, Las Niñas, La Sorrueda o [Ayagaures](/tags/ayagaures/) almacenan cantidades residuales o irrelevantes. Los efectos de la sequía no son mucho mejores en las dos presas del Cabildo en el norte de la isla, La Candelaria y El Vaquero, como tampoco las situadas en la cuenca de [La Aldea](/gran-canaria/la-aldea-de-san-nicolas/) -Siberio, El Parralillo y Caidero de Las Niñas- o en el barranco de Coruña en [Artenara](/gran-canaria/artenara/) -Las Hoyas, Lugarejos y Los Pérez-, que también tienen sus reservas al mínimo. Los siete embalses del Cabildo están al 9,2% de su capacidad total La situación más crítica en las últimas décadas se había registrado en el mes de noviembre de 2020, cuando el agua almacenada en las siete presas del Cabildo y en Soria descendió hasta los 1,32 millones de metros cúbicos, el 13% de la capacidad total. Aquellas malas cifras de hace cuatro años ya son peores desde el pasado mes de abril, cuando las reservas bajaron a 1,26 millones de metros cúbicos. Actualmente, según los datos del Consejo Insular de Aguas, las reservas de la presa de Chira se limitan a 129.053 metros cúbicos, los que significa que está al 2,29% de su capacidad. Al igual que el gran embalse de Soria, que se empezó a vaciar desde hace dos años, se está preparando para las obras de la central energética de Salto de Chira, por lo que ambas, según las previsiones, se llenarán antes de 2027 del agua potabilizada que se bombeará desde la planta desaladora de Santa Águeda. De las demás infraestructuras del Cabildo, la que almacena más agua es el embalse de La Gambuesa, con 560.745 metros cúbicos, lo que representa el 41,58% de su volumen total. Unida a ella, formando un conjunto hidrológico en el barranco que desemboca en [Maspalomas](/tags/maspalomas/), se ubica la presa de Ayagaures, ahora con solo 60.637 metros cúbicos, el 3,28%. El Mulato, en la cuenca de [Mogán](/gran-canaria/mogan/), dispone de 197,141 metros cúbicos, al 25,95% de su capacidad, mientras que la presa de Fataga está completamente vacía desde el pasado mes de mayo. En el norte, entre Artenara y La Aldea, el embalse de La Candelaria almacena 26.214 metros cúbicos, el 6,60%, mientras que El Vaquero solo tienen 3.583 metros, el 1,34%. Las siete presas del Cabildo desembalsaron el pasado mes de julio 91.746 metros cúbicos, pues llegaron al inicio del verano con poco más de un millón de metros cúbicos, y el 10,10% de su volumen total. Aparte de las salidas para el riego agrícola, una parte de las pérdidas de agua se produce por la evaporación, que se agudiza por el aumento de las temperaturas en las olas de calor. Preocupación Aunque la situación es preocupante para los agricultores que utilizan esas aguas de lluvia en las cuencas de [San Bartolomé de Tirajana](/gran-canaria/san-bartolome-de-tirajana/) o Mogán, desde el gobierno del Cabildo se resta gravedad a la situación porque el consumo humano está asegurado con las plantas desaladoras y el agrícola con las estaciones depuradoras. Las redes hidráulicas, públicas y privadas, ya tienen capacidad para transportar agua regenerada hasta las plantaciones agrícolas del sureste y del sur, mientras que en La Aldea disponen de una estación desaladora en el caso de que se agoten las reservas en sus tres embalses. Las presas de Gran Canaria, de hecho, han resistido estos casi cinco años de sequía con las lluvias recogidas en los meses de enero y febrero de 2021. Durante esas precipitaciones entraron 2,47 millones de metros cúbicos y el volumen de las presas del Cabildo aumentó hasta un total de 3,84 millones de metros cúbicos, el 37% de la capacidad, con Chira al 27%, La Gambuesa al 91%, Candelaria al 63%, Fataga al 49%, Vaquero al 70%, El Mulato al 77% y Soria al 12%. En el norte de la isla sí ha llovido desde entonces, pero la poca agua que queda en las presas del sur procede de esas lluvias de 2021. 4,14% Volumen si se incluye Soria - Las presas del Cabildo estarían a poco más del 4% de su capacidad si se contabiliza el embalse de Soria, como se hacía hasta que se empezó su vaciado por las obras de Salto de Chira. 120 Metros de muro - Soria es la mayor presa de la isla y, en teoría, tiene tanta capacidad como el resto juntas, unos 32 millones de metros cúbicos. En marzo de 2011 alcanzó su máximo histórico, 13 millones. 2020 Anterior sequía - Hay que remontarse a noviembre de 2020 para encontrar unos registros tan bajos de agua embalsada, aunque sin llegar a las cifras actuales. Ese invierno llovió y se frenó la sequía. 500 M Últimas grandes lluvias - El paso de la tormenta tropical Hermine dejó unos 500.000 metros cúbicos en las presas del Cabildo y elevó en unos cinco metros la altura en los tres grandes embalses de La Aldea.
