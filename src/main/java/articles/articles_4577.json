    "text": "Arlington County’s sheriff is seeking better pay for his deputies, citing demanding working conditions at the jail despite some progress toward better safety.\nWith dozens of off-duty deputies in the audience at a recent budget meeting, Sheriff Jose Quiroz argued that his employees deserve salary increases closer to those proposed for other public safety workers.\nWhile Arlington firefighters are anticipating an 11% raise and police officers expect a 9% pay bump, Arlington County Sheriff’s Office employees are only on track to be included in an across-the-board 3.5% salary increase for Arlington County employees.\n“It’s extremely frustrating,” Quiroz told the Arlington County Board at a work session last week. “Since Feb. 22 , you can imagine, all I hear about is, ‘Why are we getting 3.5%? What did we do wrong? Why do we not matter? What makes us different?'”\nThe sheriff’s office primarily oversees safety at the county jail and courthouse.\nThe agency — which has come under fire for in-custody deaths , safety concerns and extensive lockdowns amid staffing shortages — has made some progress in key areas over the past year. The number of lockdowns has decreased, as has to agency’s turnover rate.\nMedical issues like withdrawal symptoms and mental health episodes continue to present significant challenges, according to Quiroz and sheriff’s office data. However, the sheriff told ARLnow that he hopes an ongoing transition from contracted medical care to a “county-run, community-based model” will help provide higher-quality care in the future.\nA major step toward this is coming at the end of this month, when the sheriff’s office is expected to take on a new chief medical director.\nAt the work session, several County Board members expressed sympathy for Quiroz’s requests but stopped short of making concrete promises.\n“I will say that your comments have been impactful, and I’ll have to wrestle with them,” Vice-Chair Matt de Ferranti said. “There is no ongoing expense that I can think of that [I am] more troubled by than the limit on what we have done to this point in this arena.”\nJail workers face extensive challenges In making the case for pay bumps, Quiroz read aloud from an email he received from staff which outlines some of the unique difficulties that corrections officers face.\n“Staff get assaulted here by people throwing chairs, punching us, throwing bodily liquids, spitting on us,” he read. “Staff are cursed out. Staff are threatened by people that say they want to kill us or harm our families.”\nReported “assaults on staff” more than doubled between Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024, from 28 to 66, according to sheriff’s office data.\nThe email went on to describe the difficult jobs corrections officers are regularly tasked with.\n“It’s not uncommon in our job to save a life, or break up a fight, or hear someone banging and yelling for an extended period of time, and someone has smeared blood, feces, urine in the area we work,” Quiroz read. “This is not normal or tolerated compared to any other job.”\nThe sheriff said mental health issues are at the root of many of these issues. So far this fiscal year, the sheriff’s office has averaged 144 individuals per day with identified mental health concerns.\nStopping people with the most severe issues from harming themselves and others can place a severe burden on staff. Quiroz described one recent instance of a person requiring medical attention on multiple occasions for inserting objects into their urethra.\nTo stop the person from doing this, the jail placed them under constant observation between September and February.\n“Every single day, the staff had to prevent harm — because this person would make the situation worse on themself,” Quiroz said.\nWhile ACSO staff aren’t often involved in emergencies outside the jail, the sheriff argued that their working conditions and the service they provide make them worthy of a pay boost comparable to what other public safety employees are receiving.\n“It’s really hard to say, ‘You’re doing a great job, but you get a little bit of this, and these folks get a lot a bit of that,'” he said. “It’s not fair.”\nProgress at the jail Though County Board members emphasized the difficult decisions they face this fiscal year, several also said they want to support corrections officers if possible.\n“Recruiting and retention is significant,” County Board member JD Spain Sr. acknowledged. “If you want to keep people, you’ve got to pay people.”\nSpain is the former president of the Arlington NAACP, which has advocated for better conditions at the jail.\nHe applauded sheriff’s office data indicating some progress on longstanding issues.\nLockdowns at the jail have decreased substantially in recent years, dropping from 711 in FY 2022 to 443 in 2023 and 230 in 2024. This fiscal year, the jail is projected to see a total of 146 lockdowns.\nThe turnover rate has also dropped. While 30 deputies left the sheriff’s office in FY 2023, only 15 left last fiscal year and 10 have left this year.\nWith 57 sworn vacancies, however, overtime hours are projected to rise from 80,156 in FY 2024 to 97,574 this year.\nAdditionally, Quiroz underscored the importance of recent changes in the jail’s medical model.\nThe facility currently contracts out much of its medical care through Mediko Correctional Healthcare — a company that the county signed on with after abandoning its former provider , Corizon Correctional Health, following a series of jail deaths.\nUltimately, Quiroz wants to transition to an in-house medical model. He has hired a new medical director, Dr. Richard Malish, who will oversee both administrative and clinical duties starting Monday.\n“I ran for sheriff, and I believe in this place, but I need a need an expert that’s going to sit next to me and say, ‘Hey, Jose, this is what we should do,'” the sheriff told ARLnow.\nOther planned changes, like providing corrections officers with body-worn cameras, are still in the works. The County Board has allocated $161,140 for the cameras but the sheriff’s office hasn’t yet implemented the change.\nOverall, the proposed FY 2026 budget calls for a 2.8% increase to bring sheriff’s office expenditures to $55,093,261. Nevertheless, Quiroz maintained that his agency needs more.\n“You have people that want to see this place succeed, and I’m asking for your support to make sure that we succeed,” he said.\nPhoto via Arlington County/ YouTube",

    "text": "A \"Pancake Stack\" of Films on a Balloon Comprise the World's Most Accurate Gamma Ray Telescope Researchers combine the oldest method of capturing radiation with cutting-edge data capture A pancake stack of radioactivity-sensitive films carried through the sky by a balloon was able to take the world's most accurate picture of a neutron star's gamma ray beam. To achieve this, Kobe University researchers combined the oldest method of capturing radiation with the newest data-capturing techniques and a clever time-recording device. The researchers have [published their work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0973) in Astrophysical Journal. The stars shine their light on us in the full range of the spectrum of light, from infrared to gamma rays. For each of these bands, different sensing equipment is needed. The most challenging one is gamma rays, famous for being a high-energy product of nuclear fission, because their very short wavelength means that they don't interact with matter in the same way as other forms of light and thus can't be deflected with lenses or detected by standard sensors. Thus, there is a gap in our ability to detect the light coming from fascinating stellar objects such as supernovae and their remnants. To resolve this issue, Kobe University astrophysicist Aoki Shigeki and his team turned to the very first material that was used to detect radioactivity: photographic films. \"Our group has been focusing on the excellent capability of emulsion film to trace gamma rays with high precision and proposed that it could become an excellent gamma-ray telescope by introducing several modern data capture and analysis features,\" explains Aoki. Based on the high sensitivity of these films and a novel, automated, high-speed process of extracting data from them, the physicists' idea was to stack up a few of them to accurately capture the trajectory of the particles that the gamma ray produces on impact, just like a single pancake may capture where you poke a straw into it, but it takes a whole stack to record the straw's direction. To reduce atmospheric interference, they then mounted the stack of films onto a scientific observation balloon to lift it to a height between 35 and 40 kilometers. However, since a balloon is swaying and twisting in the wind, the direction of the \"telescope\" is not stable, so they added a set of cameras to record the gondola's orientation relative to the stars at any time. But this created another issue, because as anybody who has ever taken a photograph with long exposure knows, photographic film does not record the passage of time and so it is not directly possible to know at what time any given gamma ray impact occurred. To overcome this problem, they made the bottom three layers of film move back and forth at regular but different speeds, just like the hands of a clock. From the relative dislocation of the traces in those lower plates they could then calculate the precise time of the impact and thus correlate it with the cameras' footage. They have now published the first image resulting from this setup in the journal Astrophysical Journal. It is the most accurate image ever produced of the Vela pulsar, a fast-spinning neutron star that projects a beam of gamma rays into the sky like a lighthouse at night. \"We captured a total of several trillion tracks with an accuracy of 1/10,000 millimeters. By adding time information and combining it with attitude monitoring information, we were able to determine ‘when’ and ‘where’ the events originated with such precision that the resulting resolution was more than 40 times higher than that of conventional gamma-ray telescopes,\" Aoki summarizes his group's achievements. While these results are impressive already, the new technique opens the possibility of capturing more details in this frequency band of light than ever before. The Kobe University researcher explains, \"By means of scientific balloon-borne experiments, we can attempt to contribute to many areas of astrophysics, and in particular to open up gamma ray telescopy to 'multi-messenger astronomy' where simultaneous measurements of the same event captured through different techniques are required. Based on the success of the 2018 balloon experiment these data were generated with, we will expand the observation area and time in upcoming balloon flights and are looking forward to scientific breakthroughs in the field of gamma-ray astronomy.\" This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grants 17H06132, 18H01228 and 18K13562. It was conducted in collaboration with researchers from Okayama University of Science, Aichi University of Education, Nagoya University and Gifu University. -Note: This news release was originally published on the [Kobe University website](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/news/article/20231219-21740/) and has been edited for style.",

    "text": "En el pádel se requiere de maniobrabilidad y control, por ello, el calzado juega un papel importante a la hora de practicar este deporte, siendo un aliado para mejorar en rendimiento en la cancha y evitar lesiones.\nLea\nSubastarán un modelo original de E.T. de la película de Steven Spielberg\nPor ello se han creado distintos calzados que combinan la tecnología y la comodidad en uno de los deportes de más rápido crecimiento en Latinoamérica. Ejemplo de ello son los Skechers Viper Court especializados para pádel.\nEsta nueva colección lleva la comodidad y las innovaciones de rendimiento características de Skechers a las canchas colombianas.\nLa colección Skechers Viper Court representa el principio de la empresa de “Comodidad que mejora el rendimiento”, más un diseño transpirable y ligero, y una plantilla liviana Move Foam para mayor comodidad y absorción de impactos en cada jugada.\nAquí\nLuis Alfonso, de ‘Yo me llamo’, terminó llorando en el escenario ante el regaño de Amparo Grisales\nAdemás, el diseño se completa con una suela exterior de compuesto Goodyear Gold diseñada para una mayor durabilidad, que permite al jugador de élite realizar deslizamientos controlado, específicamente en la superficie de la cancha de pádel, partido tras partido. Esto facilita los movimientos rápidos en todas las direcciones previniendo lesiones comunes como los esguinces de tobillo.\n“Skechers ofrece comodidad que mejora el rendimiento en la cancha con una gama completa de estilos innovadores que presentan nuestras tecnologías características en opciones para todos los niveles de jugadores. Nos hemos especializado en deportes de cancha y creemos que la popularidad del pádel seguirá creciendo”, dijo Greg Smith, VP de Desarrollo de Producto y Merchandising para Skechers Performance.\nAdemás\nMike Bahía sorprende con el cover de ‘Cómo te hago entender’\nSkechers entró en el mundo de los deportes de cancha en 2022 al fichar a sus dos primeros atletas de élite que juegan Pickleball en Estados Unidos y Canadá, Tyson McGuffin y Catherine Parenteau, que compiten con calzado Skechers Pickleball y ropa de la marca. Poco después, presentó el calzado Skechers Viper Court en el US Open Pickleball Championships.\nDesde entonces, Skechers ha dominado el deporte patrocinando todas las giras y organizaciones importantes de Norteamérica y Canadá. La marca también ha añadido el English OPEN y el English Nationals de Pickleball England, así como la All India Pickleball Association (AIPA) a su lista global de patrocinadores.",

    "text": "One School at a Time: Jimtown Junior High wins Martin’s grant ELKHART COUNTY, Ind. (WNDU) - Jimtown Junior High seventh graders know a good book when they see one. “That’s pretty cool about the different kinds that there are,” said Conner Williams, a seventh-grade student at Jimtown. What does reading do for these kids? “For me, in my own mind, if I’m reading a book I can like imagine what’s happening. Like what’s going on,” said classmate Theran Harder. Language Arts teacher Brittany Hedman applied for the Martin’s One School at a Time grant with one goal in mind: buy more books! “They can learn the skills that they need through these engaging books,” Hedman said. Hedman wants to purchase several copies of different books they can read together as a class. The Martin’s money is a big help. “To purchase like class sets of these books is you know very expensive,” Hedman said. “On a teacher’s salary, I can’t afford to buy class sets of books for everybody.” “An example of one of the books that I chose would be ‘The Outsiders.’ They needed to realize that just because this book was written in this time period, those things are still relevant today,” Hedman said. Her students are listening. “Getting to know what’s going on. And like, knowing like, what happened back then. And like it that it’s still happening now,” said seventh grader Paeyton Hughes. And the best part? Improved reading skills. “I’ve gotten like better at it and I’d love to read more,” Hughes said.

Campaigners estimate that 100,000 olive trees will be uprooted to make way for the “green,” “renewable” solar farms.\nLet’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…\nSubscribe\nSpain is home to some of the world’s oldest olive trees , particularly in the Montsià plains of southern Catalonia, where more than 4,400 trees are thought to be over 1,000 years old and are still producing olives. Some are over 2,000 years old , dating all the way back to Roman times.\nThe Sénia region, located between Barcelona and Valencia, is known for having over 4,900 ancient olive trees, with the Taula del Sénia institution conducting an ongoing census of these trees since 2009.\nThese trees are not only significant for their age but also for the unique olive oil they produce, which is appreciated for its quality despite the challenges in harvesting from such old and fragile trees.\nYet, about 700 kilometres away, in southern Spain , ancient olive groves are facing uprooting as solar projects expand, particularly in the region of Andalusia, which is known for its high sunshine hours and olive oil production.\nRelated: The History and Culture of Olives in Andalucia , Toma & Coe,13 September 2023\nThe town of Lopera, for instance, is at the heart of this conflict, with plans for eight major solar installations that could affect up to 1,000 hectares of land. Olive grove owners are struggling to save their plantations and fight against expropriation, with some landowners agreeing to lease their plots while others are holding out despite facing forced expropriation.\nCampaigners predict that the eight solar projects planned for the area will require the removal of nearly 100,000 olive trees. The regional government puts the estimate lower, at 13,000. Losing 500 hectares of olive groves would wipe out more than two million euros ($2.3 million) in annual revenues, according to local olive oil cooperative La Loperana.\nSo far, about 5,000 olive trees have been uprooted in the Province of Jaén, where the equivalent of about 100 football fields of olive trees will be lost.\nRead more:\n‘It’s a crime’: Solar park boom threatens Spain’s olive tree growers , The Local, 14 April 2025 One hundred olive farmers face eviction to make way for giant solar farm , The Telegraph, 23 March 2025 Jaén is the largest producer of olive oil in the world. Olive trees in Jaén cover an area of approximately 600,000 hectares; there are so many trees that the region is known as the “Sea of Olives.” In January 2017, the “Olive Grove Landscapes of Andalusia” was placed on UNESCO’s tentative list for inclusion to be nominated as a World Heritage Site .\nIn February 2023, the application for listing the Landscape as a UNESCO World Heritage Site was finalised . It was hoped that the Sea of Olives would be among the contenders to receive protected status from the United Nations at UNESCO’s July 2024 meeting. Unfortunately, the Sea of Olives did not make it onto the list of 28 sites being considered at the UNESCO meeting. Andalusia’s olive groves are still on Spain’s tentative list .\nDespite this, the Spanish government is planning to uproot 100,000 olive trees to make way for “green,” “renewable,” intermittent and unreliable energy, as shown in the depressing video tweeted by Bernie Spofforth (“Bernie”).\nIt is especialy a shame to dothat with olive trees.\nVery few things on this planet create more food per acre than olive trees.\nWanna save the planet? Ya don't need to eat bugs. Potatoes and olive oil will do just fine. pic.twitter.com/dW2xpBlZ0I\n— Bob Hyneman (@BobhynemanUSA) May 7, 2025 Tweeting the same video, Global Dissident commented : “In Spain’s Andalusia, hundreds of thousands of ancient olive trees were destroyed to make room for solar panels. A crime against nature and common sense. We all saw the result: blackouts.”\nRelated:\nFeatured image: Spain’s ‘Sea of Olives’ Among the Candidates for UNESCO Recognition , Olive Oil Times, 29 April 2021",
