    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Norwich Evening News",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "text": "Developer: Tax subsidy would help RenCen create ‘Navy Pier-like’ destination\n- A $1.6 billion plan to remake the Renaissance Center prompted a backlash because it sought $350 million of public money\n- A Bedrock executive said it was a ‘mistake’ to emphasize public funding\n- Public money would only fund public improvements to the site, he said, instead of demolition or other costs\nDETROIT — A top aide to billionaire Dan Gilbert is taking blame for the public backlash against a $1.6 billion plan to redevelop the Renaissance Center, saying messaging for the rollout last year could have been better.\nRather than focusing on a $350 million public subsidy sought for the project, the rollout should have focused on how the project will benefit Michigan and downtown Detroit.\n“It was … a mistake on my part, to talk about it from ‘this is the number,’ “\nJared Fleisher, vice president of government affairs for the Rock Family of Companies, said Thursday at the Detroit Policy Conference at Motor City Casino.\nFleisher said he should have emphasized “the use of the funds” for the plan to demolish two towers, convert offices into housing and create a “Navy Pier-like family-friendly entertainment destination” along the Detroit River. He was referring to the Chicago landmark.\n“No one is seeking funding for demolition, and no one is seeking an upfront check from the state for the proposed redevelopment,” Fleisher told Bridge in a statement.\nRelated:\nGeneral Motors Corp. owns the RenCen and plans to exit its corporate headquarters for the Gilbert-developed Hudson’s Detroit skyscraper, compounding vacancy problems at the nearly 50-year-old complex.\nGM is partnering with Rock subsidiary Bedrock on the redevelopment project that seeks $250 million in tax capture reimbursement from the state and another $100 million contribution from the Detroit Downtown Development Authority.\nSupporters say the rehab will give a boost to a property that is rapidly becoming obsolete, empty and dragging an emergent downtown.\nCritics say the public money request is an affront to taxpayers who have already subsidized both companies.\nFleisher and David Massaron, GM’s vice president of infrastructure, spoke at the conference organized by the Detroit Regional Chamber. The speech drew a capacity crowd, even though it was the first scheduled session of the conference and traffic was slowed by overnight snow.\n“This is something that's top of mind, not just for Detroiters, but people from across the region,” said moderator Brad Williams, vice president of political affairs for the chamber.\nThe public funding would allow development of the planned public space expansion, Fleisher said, made possible by the demolition of the two towers closest to the Detroit River.\nThe primary use of the public funds would address “about $137 million of purely public space as part of this project,” Fleisher said.\nMore would aid redoing the intersection of the RenCen and Jefferson Avenue, which resembles “a game of Frogger” for pedestrians, said Fleisher, referring to the 1980s arcade game.\nThe resulting promenade would be “truly public infrastructure,” he said.\nThe state funding would come from the Transformational Brownfield Plan, created in 2017 after lobbying by Gilbert for tax reimbursement for large-scale redevelopments of obsolete property.\nUnder that financing, Bedrock would not receive up-front funding; instead, taxes generated by the redevelopment would cover a portion of the costs.\nWhile General Motors has reduced staffing to fewer than 1,000 workers from 6,000 about 15 years ago, the vacancy issues at the RenCen are “not just GM,” Massaron said.\nHe said the RenCen is tough to design because of its uniqueness, with circular walkways, concrete walls and Brutalist architecture. The automaker had tried for years to come up with a redevelopment plan before it connected to Bedrock.\nThe bulk of the buildings include “traditional office space that needs tremendous investment to be functional,” Massaron said. Post-COVID, very few tenants would seek that kind of space, he said.\nBusiness Watch\nCovering the intersection of business and policy, and informing Michigan employers and workers on the long road back from coronavirus.\nAbout Business WatchSubscribeShare tips and questionswith Bridge Business Editor Paula Gardner\nThanks to our Business Watch sponsors.\nSupport Bridge's nonprofit civic journalism.

Son unidades médicas especializadas que nacieron del corazón de este Gobierno de Chiapas, que tienen todos los recursos materiales y humanos, y la característica de que son atendidas por mujeres, a fin de cuidar la intimidad de las pacientes, quienes también pueden elegir entre parto horizontal, vertical o en agua. La diferencia con otras clínicas similares en el mundo es que las nuestras otorgan los servicios gratuitos”, apuntó.

Precisó que, tan sólo con el programa “Barriguita llena, corazón contento de regreso a casa”, a lo largo de estos seis años de gobierno, se han otorgado alimentos calientes y nutritivos a niñas, niños y adolescentes estudiantes de los municipios considerados con grado de marginación y alta marginación. Finalmente, Escandón Cadenas resaltó que gracias a las operaciones que todos los días se llevan a cabo mediante las aeronaves oficiales, las cuales se han convertido en verdaderas ambulancias aéreas que llegan hasta los lugares más alejados, se ha logrado salvar muchas vidas.
