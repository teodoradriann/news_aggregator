    "published": "2024-02-24T00:00:00Z",
    "title": "Confronting My Fear | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) I’d like to tell you about my realizations regarding fear and this persecution. I was [illegally sentenced] and imprisoned twice for practicing Falun Dafa. I returned home after the second jail term ended in June 2022 and wondered why I wasn’t able to successfully negate the old forces’ arrangements. During this past year, through studying the [Fa] (teachings) and reading experience sharing articles written by other practitioners, I realized that I did not truly believe in Master and the Fa 100%. Even though I looked inward and sent righteous thoughts, I wasn’t able to completely disintegrate the persecution. The article “ [Believing in Master and Dafa, Divine Powers Manifest](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/1/26/182754.html)” published on the Minghui website in 2019 left a deep impression on me. In 2006, the author was sent taken to a detention center in Guan County, Shandong Province. When her daughter told her the police planned to send take her to a forced labor camp the next day and the documents were already submitted, the practitioner said firmly, “Whoever sentenced me made a mistake. One has to be on my level to be able to sentence me.” She was determined not to be sent to a labor camp and sent righteous thoughts to negate their plans. She was not taken to the labor camp and was released the following month. After she got home, her daughter told her that her name was already submitted to the Zibo Forced Labor Camp, but the guard handling the case managed to remove it. She told the practitioner’s daughter, “I don’t want to be held responsible for your mother. I’m letting her go because, after she came here, I haven’t been able to sleep. My head hurts and I can’t relax.” When I read what the practitioner said, “One has to be on my level to be able to sentence me,” I was shocked. I wondered why I never thought about the persecution that way. This practitioner overcame the persecution with her firm belief in Master and the Fa. She validated what Master said in “The Master-Disciple Bond,” [Hong Yin II](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/HongYin-v2-online-2022.pdf), “...When disciples have ample righteous thoughtsMaster has the power to turn the tide” Master told us that before July 20, 1999, he pushed us to our positions, which were our highest levels. I didn’t have a deep enough understanding of this part of the Fa. I didn’t realize Master gave me strong capabilities, so my thoughts were not righteous. When I recalled what happened the two times I was illegally sentenced and persecuted, I realized that Master repeatedly gave me hints that these were all illusions. The first time I was sentenced the old forces caused me to have fear. The second time I was persecuted, I remembered what Master said: “Master has the power to turn the tide” (“The Master-Disciple Bond,” [Hong Yin II](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/HongYin-v2-online-2022.pdf)). However, I was affected by fear and my experience the first time I was incarcerated. My righteous thoughts and main consciousness were not strong, and I was hindered by an ordinary person’s concept that seeing is believing. I was not able to successfully disintegrate the persecution. From the Fa we know there is no Internet blockade, and the persecution is an illusion. The Internet blockade and this persecution are imposed by the old forces on Falun Dafa and practitioners. We must not accept this and eliminate it—only when we do this will we be meeting the requirements of the Fa and following Master’s arrangements. I realized that before July 20, 1999, when Master pushed me to my highest position, it was a position in the new universe. Nothing in the old universe can affect me, because I am part of the new universe. Once I realized this I felt surrounded by very strong energy when I sent righteous thoughts. I was sending forth righteous thoughts and eliminating evil factors as a king and lord in the universe. Although I cannot see scenes in other dimensions, I knew my righteous thoughts were extremely powerful. I also enlightened that it is not sufficient to just have a righteous mind, but one’s righteous thoughts must be strong. Master said, “However strong the righteous thoughts are, that’s how great the power is.” (“Also in a Few Words,” [The Essentials of Diligent Progress II](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/jjyz2.htm#AlsoinaFewWords)) So how can we maintain a strong righteous mind at all times? It has to come from the Fa. Master repeatedly emphasized that it’s necessary to study the Fa more and study the Fa well. After more than 20 years of cultivation, I understood that studying the Fa more and studying the Fa well is the foundation for maintaining a strong righteous mind at all times, and it is also a must for doing the [three things] well. I’ve repeatedly stumbled on my cultivation journey. But compassionate Master never gave up on me. For 26 years, Master helped me in each and every step I took to move forward on my cultivation path. Eliminating the Mentality of “Being Persecuted” Because I was sentenced and incarcerated twice, I developed a mentality of suspicion and fear. After I returned home from the first jail term, a neighbor was assigned to monitor me. The first day after I returned home from the second jail term, when I stood on the balcony, I noticed a bald man in the adjacent building opened his window and looked outside. I began to suspect that he was monitoring me, because this was exactly what happened when a neighbor monitored me after the first jail term. In the days that followed, whenever I went out to buy groceries, sure enough the bald man opened the window and watched me leave. Three months later, my mother-in-law needed help, so I stayed with her for a few months. The first morning when I got up at 3 a.m. to do the exercises, I noticed a light in the next building was on inside someone’s apartment. I began paying attention to it. When I went to bed after midnight the light was still on. When I got up at 3 a.m. the next morning it was still lit. Then I thought, “Is someone monitoring me? I haven’t told anyone I was here.” Through studying the Fa, I strengthened my righteous thoughts and understood that this was all due to the fear, suspicion, and a mentality of “being persecuted” that the old forces imposed on me. My true self did not have these notions. Monitoring practitioners is a type of persecution imposed on us by the old forces. Master does not accept or recognize it, and neither should we. I sent righteous thoughts to eliminate these thoughts and fears, and I tried to catch them whenever they surfaced. They gradually became weaker and weaker. I also sent righteous thoughts every day to eliminate the evil factors in other dimensions and the old forces that made the arrangements for people who participated in the persecution—including policemen and community organization members who harassed me, causing these people to commit crimes against Dafa. I then experienced a miraculous phenomenon. In March, I suddenly felt the Falun (law wheel) spinning in my abdomen for quite a while. It felt as though it was eliminating evil substances. Two days later, the police from the nearby station called me. In early August, the same thing happened again. I truly experienced that the people who carried out the persecution were indeed manipulated by the evil beings in other dimensions. I also felt the Falun was protecting me, just as Master said, “Our Falun Dafa will protect students from deviating. How does it protect you? If you are a true cultivator, our Falun will safeguard you.” (Lecture One, [Zhuan Falun](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/zfl2014/zfl_2014_1.html)) I moved back home this past July. When I was on the balcony, I thought, “Is that bald man really monitoring me?” As soon as I had this thought, he opened the window and looked out. I immediately understood that the thought was sent to me by the old forces. I should not have this mentality of “being persecuted.” I said to the old forces, “Stop creating these illusions.” I continued sending righteous thoughts to eliminate all my negative thoughts. The man no longer opens the window. Final Remarks I realized that cultivation is like sailing against the current—if one doesn’t continually move forward, then one is going backward. As Master’s Fa-rectification progresses, the requirements for us are becoming higher and higher. Master said in “Diligence and Righteous Enlightenment” ( [Hong Yin II](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/HongYin-v2-online-2022.pdf)): “Don’t let up in studying the Fa;amidst it transformation happensLet nothing sway conviction;of it comes right fruit and the blooming lotus” I will maintain a motivated cultivation state, just as when I first began to practice Falun Dafa, and I will cultivate diligently. These are my realizations based on my personal understanding. If anything is not in accordance with the Fa, please kindly point it out. Copyright © 2024 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "In a thrilling showdown between Washington and St. Louis, Washington secured a win, largely thanks to home runs by L. Thomas and Wood, marking a significant game in the series. Despite St. Louis' efforts, they couldn't bridge the gap, leaving Washington to celebrate their 3-1 victory.\nKey Moments That Defined the Game\nThe game kicked off with Washington setting a strong pace, with L. Thomas hitting a home run that set the tone for the rest of the match. Wood's performance was equally impressive, contributing significantly to Washington's win. St. Louis attempted a comeback in the later innings, highlighted by J. Wood's home run, but it wasn't enough to overturn Washington's early lead. The match concluded with a 3-1 scoreline in favor of Washington, showcasing their offensive strength and strategic gameplay.\nImpact Performers and Strategic Plays\nWashington's pitchers played a crucial role in their victory, keeping St. Louis' hitters at bay for most of the game. The defensive strategy employed by Washington proved effective, with Corbin, Law, Rainey, Garcia, Ferrer, and Willingham delivering outstanding performances from the mound. On the other side, St. Louis' Gibson faced a challenging game, but the team's resilience was evident, with players like Nootbaar and Prieto making significant contributions.\nReflections on the Game and What's Next\nThis game was not just a testament to Washington's prowess but also highlighted areas of improvement for St. Louis. The strategic deployment of players and the pivotal moments that led to Washington's win underline the importance of early leads and consistent performance. Looking ahead, both teams are focusing on their next matchups, with Washington aiming to maintain their winning streak and St. Louis seeking redemption. The season is far from over, and the potential for turnaround stories remains high.\nThe game, lasting just over two hours, was not only a display of skill and strategy but also a reminder of the unpredictability and excitement that baseball brings. As both teams regroup and look forward to their next games, fans are left anticipating more thrilling encounters in the coming weeks.",

This issue poses financial barriers for patients, limiting their access to necessary vision correction solutions. For instance, glasses and contact lenses, commonly used to correct myopia and presbyopia, can be costly, especially when considering the need for frequent replacements. Specialized lenses, such as those for astigmatism, add to the expense. Refractive surgeries, like LASIK and PRK, offer long-term solutions but come with substantial costs, making them inaccessible for many. The need for pre- and post-operative care further increases expenses. These financial burdens not only affect individual patients but also healthcare providers, discouraging investment in advanced technologies and limiting the availability of treatment options. The high cost may also discourage individuals from seeking early intervention, leading to more complex and expensive treatments in the future. These factors are expected to hinder market growth during the forecast period. The Myopia and Presbyopia Treatment Market faces several challenges. Ageing adults and geriatric population deal with distance vision impairment and presbyopia, requiring solutions like bifocal and multifocal lenses, monovision lenses, and modified monovision lenses. Conductive keratoplasty surgery, LASEK, and phacoemulsification systems with intraocular lenses offer surgical options. Diabetes and eye pressure issues add complexity. Telemedicine and ophthalmic surgeries expand access in rural areas and high income regions. Vision correction options include progressive multifocals, contact lenses, and glasses. Ethnic minorities, women, older population, teenagers, young adults, adults, and senior citizens are key patient demographics.

The global myopia and presbyopia treatment market are witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of myopia worldwide. Corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses, are popular treatment options for myopia. For instance, concave lenses help redirect light onto the retina, improving vision. Refractive surgery, like LASIK, reshapes the cornea to correct refractive errors. Another non-surgical option is Orthokeratology, which involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to gently reshape the cornea. Myopia control strategies, such as multifocal contact lenses, have emerged to slow down myopia progression in children, reducing the risk of complications. According to the National Institutes of Health, orthokeratology and soft bifocal contact lenses have slowed myopia progression by nearly 50% in children. These factors are driving the demand for myopia treatment and expected to fuel market growth during the forecast period.\nDownload a Sample of our comprehensive report today to discover how AI-driven innovations are reshaping competitive dynamics\nResearch Analysis\nMyopia and presbyopia are common vision impairments affecting millions of people worldwide.

    "text": "Estados Unidos, Francia, la Unión Europea y varios países árabes pidieron el miércoles un “alto al fuego inmediato de 21 días\" en Líbano, donde los ataques entre Israel y Hezbolá amenazan con envolver a Oriente Medio en una guerra total, el mayor temor manifestado por la comunidad internacional. Pero Israel rechazó este jueves la medida.\n\"Pedimos un alto el fuego inmediato de 21 días en la frontera entre Líbano e Israel para dar una oportunidad a la diplomacia para alcanzar una solución diplomática\" a la situación en Líbano y Gaza, señala una declaración conjunta divulgada en la noche del miércoles por la Casa Blanca, como parte de la Asablea General de Naciones Unidas.\nPublicidad Estados Unidos, Francia, la UE, Australia, Canadá, Alemania, Italia, Japón, Arabia Saudita, Emiratos Árabes Unidos y Qatar firman la declaración, que llega tras unos días de intensas negociaciones diplomáticas.\n¿Qué dice la Comunidad Internacional?\nEn otro comunicado conjunto emitido tras su reunión al margen de la Asamblea General de la ONU en Nueva York, el presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden , y el francés, Emmanuel Macron , aseguraron que han \"trabajado juntos en los últimos días\" para alcanzar este llamamiento conjunto a un alto el fuego temporal, al que ahora se han sumado otros países.\nBiden había advertido este miércoles que \"es posible una guerra a gran escala\" en Oriente Medio, mientras que Macron pidió \"enérgicamente a Israel que detenga la escalada en Líbano y a Hezbolá que deje de disparar\" cohetes.\n\"Una guerra total entre Hezbolá e Israel sería devastadora para ambas partes\", advirtió Lloyd Austin, El secretario de Defensa estadounidense y añadió que un alto el fuego ayudaría a \"implementar un acuerdo para asegurar una tregua en Gaza\".\nEl ministro francés de Asuntos Exteriores, Jean-Noël Barrot, fue el primero en mencionar esta propuesta en una reunión de emergencia del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU sobre la situación en Líbano.\n\"El infierno se está desatando en Líbano\", advirtió el secretario general de la ONU, Antonio Guterres , en el Consejo de Seguridad.\nNumerosos dirigentes árabes y musulmanes, aunque no únicamente, criticaron a Israel en este cónclave diplomático anual, multiplicando sus condenas al primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu , acusado por el presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, de \"arrastrar a toda la región a la guerra\".\nPor otro lado, el ministro iraní de Asuntos Exteriores, Abbas Araghchi , Medio Oriente está \"al borde de la catástrofe total\", advirtió justo antes de la reunión, asegurando que Teherán apoyará a Líbano \"por todos los medios\".\nPublicidad podcast Escucha nuestros podcast aquí Lo último Ayotzinapa: la promesa que AMLO no pudo cumplir en su sexenio Aún diezmado por el paso de “Otis”, Acapulco enfrenta los daños por “John” Humbe ver más Publicidad\n¿Qué dice Israel?\nEl ejército israelí indicó el miércoles que está preparando \"una posible entrada\" en Líbano para golpear a Hezbolá, contra el que su fuerza aérea está llevando a cabo nuevos ataques mortíferos, tras la interceptación de un misil disparado contra Tel Aviv.\nEl ministro israelí de Relaciones Exteriores, Israel Katz , dijo el jueves que no habrá una tregua con el movimiento libanés Hezbolá, después de que Estados Unidos y sus aliados pidieran un cese al fuego de 21 días.\n\"No habrá un cese al fuego en el norte. Seguiremos combatiendo a la organización terrorista Hezbolá con toda la fuerza hasta la victoria y hasta el retorno seguro a sus casas de los habitantes del norte\", escribió Katz en la red social X.\nEl embajador israelí, Danny Danon, afirmó que su país preferiría utilizar la vía diplomática para asegurar su frontera norte con Líbano, pero que utilizará \"todos los medios\" a su alcance si no se logra un acuerdo con Hezbolá.\nEl ministro de Finanzas israelí, Bezalel Smotrich , un aliado clave de ultraderecha dentro de la coalición de gobierno de Netanyahu, rechazó igualmente un alto el fuego. \"La campaña [militar] en el norte debe terminar de una sola manera: aplastando a Hezbolá y eliminando su capacidad para hacer daño a los habitantes del norte\" de Israel, indicó Smotrich en la red social X.\nPero según el ministro, \"no debemos darle tiempo al enemigo para recuperarse de los golpes violentos que recibió y reorganizarse para continuar la guerra después de 21 días\".\nDesde principios de semana, los ataques israelíes han dejado más de 600 muertos en Líbano, entre ellos muchos civiles.\nLo Último Congreso La Cámara de Diputados refuerza blindaje para el cambio de poder el 1 de octubre CDMX ¿Cómo consultar el saldo de Mi Beca para Empezar? CDMX Estudiantes toman planteles de la UNAM para protestar por Ayotzinapa Mercados Peso se aprecia en sesión volátil tras anuncio de Banxico Publicidad Publicidad\nGuerra sin fin\nPero las salidas a la crisis son limitadas. Washington siempre ha creído que un alto el fuego en Gaza acompañado de la liberación de los rehenes en manos de Hamás era la mejor manera de propiciar una solución diplomática entre Israel y Hezbolá.\nEn particular, porque el grupo proiraní afirma actuar en apoyo del movimiento palestino Hamás en Gaza, que lanzó un ataque mortal sin precedentes contra el sur de Israel el 7 de octubre.\nPero las negociaciones para dicha tregua, mediadas por Estados Unidos, Qatar y Egipto , han llegado a un punto muerto total, e Israel ha hecho oídos sordos a los llamados a la desescalada y ha abierto este segundo frente en el norte, tras meses de intercambios de ataques.\nSin embargo, para Brian Katulis , del Middle East Institute , \"Israel y el eje iraní llevan meses coqueteando con una guerra regional a gran escala, y Estados Unidos no tiene ni la voluntad ni la dirección estratégica para alterar fundamentalmente esta dinámica\".\nFirme partidario de Israel, Biden se ha negado hasta ahora a utilizar la influencia de las armas suministradas por Estados Unidos, con la excepción de una entrega de bombas en mayo, y parece poco probable que cambie de estrategia en vísperas de las elecciones presidenciales del 5 de noviembre.\nTags Conflicto Palestina-Israel Hezbolá Organización de las Naciones Unidas Estados Unidos Más acerca del autor: AFP @ExpansionMx Newsletter function GetReferrerDomainX() { var preUrl = document.referrer; //console.log(\"GetReferrerDomainX",
