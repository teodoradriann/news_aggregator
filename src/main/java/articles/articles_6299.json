    "text": "VANCOUVER (CANADA)\nThe Catholic Register - Archdiocese of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nFebruary 22, 2024\nThe Archdiocese of Vancouver has reached a settlement with a man who was sexually assaulted by a priest and a teacher at Holy Trinity Parish in North Vancouver in the 1970s.\nThe settlement was reached during the civil trial at B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster, where the plaintiff, “John Doe,” described abuse by Fr. John Kilty and teacher Raymond Clavin.\nBefore the trial began, the Archdiocese acknowledged the abuse occurred but denied being negligent as an organization.\nAt John Doe’s request, the terms of the settlement are not being disclosed.\nIn a statement, the Archdiocese said, “No words of regret can fully repair the profound horror of the past and the pain endured by victims/survivors of abuse.” It said Archbishop J. Michael Miller extended “heartfelt sorrow to the plaintiff and all victims of abuse on behalf of the Catholic community.”\nBeginning in late 2018, the Archdiocese of Vancouver conducted a review of historic files relating to sexual abuse by clergy. The goal of that review, said the statement, “was to reach and help more survivors, address past wrongs and to show more transparency.” The Archdiocese came forward with the publication of names and photos of priests known to have abused children.\n“We hope the publicity from this case will help give any other victims/survivors the confidence to come forward and get the help they deserve.”\nThe Archdiocese encouraged anyone who has been a victim of Church-related abuse to come forward, no matter how long ago the abuse may have occurred. It said an independent social worker is available by calling (604) 363-7338 or 1-800-968-3146.\n“They will compassionately listen to you and outline some possible options for care. We understand how much courage it takes to report your experience, and we sincerely hope that every victim/survivor will consider coming forward.”",

    "text": "New York (CNN) — Tyson Foods suspended its CFO John R. Tyson after he was arrested Thursday on charges of DWI and careless driving. Tyson, the great grandson of the founder of the meat processing company, was previously arrested in 2022 on charges of public intoxication and criminal trespass .\nThe 34-year-old was booked early Thursday and has since been released, according to the Washington County, Arkansas, Detention Intake Report. His initial hearing is scheduled for Friday.\n“We are aware that John Randal Tyson, Chief Financial Officer of Tyson Foods, was arrested for an alleged DWI,” the company said in a statement Thursday.\n“Tyson Foods has suspended Mr. Tyson from his duties effective immediately and named Curt Calaway as interim Chief Financial Officer.”\nBack in 2022, Tyson was charged after he allegedly wandered into the wrong home and fell asleep. News reports at the time said he was found asleep on a bed by a woman who lived there. She called the police, who then identified Tyson through his driver’s license. He reportedly later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges related to the incident.\nTyson issued an apology during an analyst call in November 2022. “I’m embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions,” he said at the time. “I also want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees.”\nDuring that same call, Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King said that the company was taking the incident seriously through its “corporate governance process.”\nTo report an error or typo, email news@komu.com .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
