    "title": "Improved Attention and Memory: Scientists Uncover New Cognitive Benefits of Video Games",
    "text": "New research reveals that frequent video game players exhibited improved performance in cognitive tasks related to attention and memory. A new study, published in the British Psychological Society’s British Journal of Psychology, reveals that regular gamers exhibit enhanced performance in tasks assessing cognitive functions, including attention and memory. The study, which took place at the Lero Esports Science Research Lab at the University of Limerick, involved 88 young adults, half of whom regularly played more than seven hours of action-based video games each week. Participants were tested with three tasks measuring different aspects of their cognitive performance – a simple reaction time test, a task that involved switching between responding to combinations of numbers and letters to evaluate executive function and working memory, and a maze-based activity to assess visuospatial memory. The researchers found that regular gamers were able to complete the number-letter task and the maze task 12.7 and 17.4 % quicker respectively than the group of non-gamers. Cognitive Benefits and Implications “The regular playing of video games is often criticized and seen as unhealthy, but our research shows that gamers may enjoy some cognitive benefits over the wider population, particularly relating to attentiveness and memory,” according to Dr Adam Toth of University of Limerick and Lero, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software, and one of the authors of the research. Dr Mark Campbell, added: “In line with previous work out of our lab, this research may have implications in sectors where cognitive performance is paramount, such as surgery, and air traffic control, where video game play could be encouraged to help develop the elite cognitive performance required.” The research also investigated a further angle – whether gamers are less prone to suffering from cognitive fatigue than the wider population. Some participants were assigned an additional task, designed to require concentration for a long period of time and bring about cognitive fatigue (decline in performance), before being reevaluated on the initial cognitive tests. The researchers found that gamers and non-gamers saw their performance decline at the same rate, with no significant difference found in the level of cognitive fatigue experienced.

O Sporting conseguiu uma vitória complicada, e com remontada, (3-2) diante do Juventude Pacense, na 19.ª ronda nada do campeonato nacional de hóquei em patins, ao passo que o FC Porto triunfou na receção ao HC Braga.\nComecemos pelo Pavilhão João Rocha. Os verde e brancos estavam de sobreaviso após a derrota na primeira volta. As dificuldades confirmaram-se, mas o Sporting acabou por segurar o triunfo e não sem antes ter de dar a volta a uma entrada negativa.\nOs visitantes inauguram o marcador, quando Tomás Pereira bateu Ângelo Girão ao minuto 11. Após um penálti falhado por Verona, Facundo Bridge fez o golo do empate (17', mas Joca Guimarães (23') deixou os visitantes novamente na frente antes do intervalo.\nToni Pérez (26') empatou logo no início da segunda parte, antes de Nolito Romero (44') dar o melhor seguimento a um livre resultante da 10.ª falta do Juventude Pacense em todo o jogo e carimbar a vitória da equipa da casa.\nMas a norte, o FC Porto triunfou de forma tranquila na receção ao HC Braga (3-1). Carlo di Benedetto (10') abriu o ativo, naquele que foi o único golo do primeiro tempo.\nGonçalo Alves (30') e Ezequiel Mena (34') praticamente sentenciaram o resultado com dois golos a abrir o segundo tempo. Gonçalo Meira (48') fez o tento de honra dos bracarenses.\nCom esta combinação de resultados, o Sporting lidera o campeonato com 49 pontos, mais um que o FC Porto e quatro que o Benfica.

    "text": "KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his 'sent by God' comment, albeit without naming the country's top leader.Speaking at an election rally in Mathurapur in the Sunderbans area of South 24 Parganas district, she claimed that \\\"faced with the phobia of a certain election defeat\\\", BJP leaders were saying \\\"all kinds of things that made no sense\\\".Dripping with sarcasm, Banerjee, in an oblique reference to PM Modi, said, \\\"He is now calling himself the son of God. He claims that, unlike us, he doesn't have biological parents. He says he has been sent by God. I ask, does God send someone to orchestrate riots or spread lies through advertisements or jail people in the name of NRC exercise?\\\"\\\"Does God send his emissary to sponsor hooliganism in the name of CAA or stop funds for 100-day work or prevent rural houses from being built? Does God go back on his promise of depositing Rs 15 lakhs in people's bank accounts? God cannot do such things,\\\" she added.The chief minister's remark came in the backdrop of PM Modi's interview to a national TV channel where he reportedly said, \\\"Until my mother was alive, I used to think I was born biologically.After her demise, when I look at my experiences, I am convinced that I was sent by God. This strength is not from my body. It has been given to me by God.That's why God also gave me the ability, strength, pure-heartedness, and inspiration to do this. I'm nothing but an instrument that God has sent.\\\"Banerjee further ridiculed Modi for BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra's controversial remark about Lord Jagannath being a \\\"devotee of the prime minister\\\", which Patra had later retracted.\\\"If Lord Jagannath is a devotee of Modi babu as claimed by his workers, then shouldn't we build a temple in his name, offer pujas and prasad before his photo and engage a priest for him? We can do all that, but he shouldn't play politics by saying such things,\\\" Banerjee said..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",

    "text": "Gracie Cappelle should have been looking forward to her freshman year at Texas State University. Instead, she got a crash course in ulcerative colitis (UC). “I had never heard of ulcerative colitis,” Cappelle, 19, told The Post. “It took me a really long time to even understand what was happening within my body.” Cappelle was diagnosed with the chronic disease in the summer of 2024. She spent her freshman year eliminating dairy and fatty foods from her diet — not easy as a college student — in the hopes of managing her symptoms since there’s no cure for UC. About a million Americans are believed to have UC, the most common type of inflammatory bowel disease. Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes the condition, but they think it’s related to abnormal immune system reactions. Inflammation and ulcers develop in the lining of the colon and rectum, often causing stomach pain, bloody diarrhea and frequent bowel movements. Crohn’s disease is similar but can affect any part of the GI tract. Daily dose of baby aspirin can halve your chances of getting colorectal cancer if you have this condition UC is most often diagnosed in people 15 to 30 years old. Adults between 50 and 70 are also at higher risk. Cappelle didn’t immediately realize that something was amiss. She occasionally noticed blood in her stool but figured it was no big deal. “It wasn’t bad at first,” Cappelle recalled. “I looked it up a couple of times, and the only two things that would come up were internal hemorrhoids or colon cancer . And I was like, ‘OK, well, I don’t have colon cancer, so it’s probably just internal hemorrhoids.’ So I wasn’t worried about it.” The bleeding eventually intensified to the point where it was happening every day — and she found herself rushing to the bathroom more often. A colonoscopy was scheduled for two weeks before she left for college. “I literally came out of my colonoscopy, and my doctor told me that I had [UC],” Cappelle said. Meet the ‘crunchy’ college students crusading against ultra-processed foods and forever chemicals on TikTok She needed to overhaul her diet immediately. Individual triggers vary, but UC sufferers tend to experience flare-ups with high-fat foods, spicy foods and foods rich in insoluble fiber. Alcohol, caffeinated beverages and sugary drinks are often no-nos. Before her diagnosis, Cappelle typically had yogurt for breakfast, a sandwich with Cheez-Its for lunch and ground turkey, chicken or steak with potatoes or rice for dinner — or fast food. “I definitely didn’t eat well,” she admitted. “If I wanted [Raising] Canes or Chick-fil-A, if I wanted fast food, I was going to go get the fast food.” She first axed spicy foods, including her beloved Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and hot sauce, soda and gluten. #whatieatinaday #cleaneating #healthyrecipes #healthyliving #glutenfree #dairyfree #ucfriendly #ulcerativecolitis CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER Unfortunately, her stomach pain didn’t go away right away. “I was trying to eat whole foods, but obviously that’s hard, especially being a freshman in college,” Cappelle said. “You’re living in a dorm, so you really don’t have a kitchen.” She came home to the greater Houston area in December, cutting dairy and alcohol from her diet and stepping up her exercise routine. She also began working with a therapist and getting infusions of Entyvio, prescription medication that targets gut inflammation. Her stomach pain and bloody stool subsided, and she plans to return to Texas State in August. “I think it’ll be easier this next year, because I will have an apartment and my own kitchen,” Cappelle said. “It is hard because you can’t necessarily eat what everybody else is eating. But, for me, personally, it’s not worth it to eat like that, knowing what could happen if I do eat like that.” She’s been sharing her journey on TikTok , hoping to connect with people facing the same challenges. “The hardest part for me [is] feeling so alone,” Cappelle said. “I really just want to put the message out there of, you’re not alone in this, and you can get better, and you will get better.” For the latest in lifestyle, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/lifestyle/",

    "text": "Tres diputados nacionales de la UCR denunciaron penalmente al presidente Javier Milei, y al secretario de Culto, Francisco Sánchez, por el viaje a España , que consideraron \"privado\" pero solventado con fondos públicos.\nLos diputados Fernando Carbajal, de Formosa; Pedro Galimberti, de Entre Ríos; y Manuel Aguirre, de Corrientes , formularon la presentación, que quedó radicada ante el juzgado federal a cargo de Ariel Lijo. La denuncia apunta a los delitos de malversación de caudales públicos, estafa y defraudación contra la administración pública.\nPerjuicio para el Estado Tras describir las características del viaje, la reunión de la agrupación política española VOX y las características de la exposición de Milei, los legisladores afirmaron que el viaje no fue oficial .\nNo obstante, añadieron, \"el Gobierno, a través de su inefable vocero Manuel Adorni , ha pretendido otorgar carácter ‘oficial’ al viaje realizado por una modestísima reunión con empresarios que habría realizado el día sábado con un pequeño grupo de empresarios\".\n\"Es indudable que esa pequeña reunión, armada de apuro, constituyó sólo un burdo intento de otorgar algún tipo de justificación jurídica al viaje privado del Presidente , para así poder justificar los cientos de miles de dólares propiedad del Estado nacional gastados para asistir a actos de naturaleza estrictamente personal y a su exclusivo beneficio\", afirmaron en otro pasaje, al tiempo que destacaron que \"el perjuicio ocasionado al Estado es más que relevante\" .\nSobre la base de un artículo publicado en La Nación , la denuncia asegura que \"solo el uso del avión presidencial rondó los 200 mil dólares\" .\n\"La comitiva se hospedó en un hotel de 5 estrellas en la Gran Vía de Madrid , con suites que se ofrecen en Internet por un rango de precios que va de 900 a 1400 euros la noche. A eso debe adicionarse los viáticos, tanto del Presidente como del resto de la comitiva, cuya integración aun no fue debidamente informada, como tampoco el total de los gastos ocasionados, pese a haberle sido requerida la información al vocero Presidencial\", subraya la presentación.\nSánchez, que no es Pedro sino Francisco En cuanto al secretario de Culto, la denuncia sostiene que \"no viajó en avión particular, pero sí se pagó un pasaje en primera clase con fondos públicos , y se otorgó los correspondientes generosos viáticos\". Dijeron también que \"se autorizó un pasaje en Ejecutiva por Aerolíneas Argentinas, que según se observa en las páginas de la empresa cuesta entre 4 mil y 6 mil dólares . Después se hizo autorizar viáticos por 3.120 euros para seis días de ‘misión’\".\nLa denuncia propuso como medida de prueba que \"por la vía diplomática correspondiente se requiera al Reino de España remita copia de la información proveída por la República Argentina respecto al carácter de la visita del Presidente Milei a ese País entre el 17 y el 19 de mayo de 2024\" .",
