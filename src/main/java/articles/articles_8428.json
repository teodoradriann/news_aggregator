    "text": "Americans spend billions of dollars on our hair. We shampoo, brush, braid, cut and comb it. Our locks are gelled, moussed, sprayed and blow-dried. Occasionally, our mane coiffed, quiffed and occasionally fluffed. That’s a whole lot of hair care.\nBut do some of our ’dos endanger our health?\nThe problem lies in a substance used in many products applied to hair, like gels and sprays. A recent paper from scientists at Purdue and Indiana universities says animal studies show that the substance, siloxane [SI-lok-sayn], accumulates in the body. The compound, which gives hair a shiny, less-frizzy look, has been shown to cause liver, lung and nervous system damage in animals.\nFew human studies, however, have examined their long-term health impact.\nScientists worry that products containing siloxanes might be especially dangerous when applied in a confined space. With heated styling tools, the compounds get into the air and the lungs more easily.\nThe study’s authors recruited volunteers who went through their normal hair-care routine in a lab space. The researchers measured air contamination while participants styled their hair.\nEmissions of siloxanes soared in the enclosed space when a styling tool was used at its highest heat setting. They were also present when no heat was applied. Using the bathroom fan dramatically lessened air contamination but did not eliminate it.\nThe researchers say an investigation of the long-term health impacts of siloxane products is urgently needed.\nThe study points to the need to do your hair grooming in a well-ventilated area. Open a window. Use a fan.\nDon’t make that beehive a buzzkill.",

    "text": "El entrenador del Covirán Granada, Pablo Pin, dijo tras la derrota de su equipo por 68-80 ante el Lenovo Tenerife que los suyos no tuvieron la “aportación colectiva” que necesitan para poder ganar. “En el primer cuarto estuvimos bien, con ritmo, jugando con velocidad y encontrando buenas situaciones en ataque, todo lo contrario al segundo y tercer cuarto, en los que no hemos encontrado situaciones de ventaja, no hemos repartido bien los tiros y hemos tenido mala anotación”, dijo Pin sobre el choque en rueda de prensa. “En defensa hemos subido líneas y el equipo ha hecho un esfuerzo grande para meterse en el partido, hemos estado cerca en varias ocasiones, pero Marcelinho (Huertas) te domina el partido, es un jugador diferencial, y ellos nos han hecho daño en el bloqueo directo. Necesitamos una aportación colectiva y no la hemos tenido”, finalizó con su resumen. “Lenovo Tenerife tiene experiencia, tablas, veteranía y es mejor equipo que nosotros. Para ganarle tenemos que estar todos y jugar todos bien, y no pasó ninguna de las dos cosas”, sentenció Pin. Más claves El técnico cree que los problemas en ataque vinieron porque les faltó “verticalidad al aro” y les costó “en la circulación de balón”. Además, echaron de menos al ausente por lesión Lluis Costa “en la generación de juego”. “Necesitamos la aportación de todos y ahora necesitamos descansar, recuperarnos físicamente y entrenar con normalidad porque llevamos tres semanas que no hemos podido hacerlo”, finalizó Pin.",

    "title": "More than 100 people rescued from ice floe in Minnesota lake ｜ New York Daily News",
    "text": "More than 100 people were safely rescued from an ice floe that detached from the shoreline of a northern Minnesota lake Friday night, authorities said. The ice chunk had broken off from a fishing area on the southeastern shore of Upper Red Lake, the Beltrami County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Emergency workers were dispatched for an ice rescue just after 5 p.m., local time. Before they arrived at the scene, bystanders attempted to rescue those on the ice using a canoe. However, their attempt failed and four individuals fell into the open water and were brought back to the ice floe. The first four people were rescued around 6:40 p.m., Sheriff Jason Riggs said. By 7:37 p.m., officials determined all 122 individuals on the ice floe had been safely brought to shore. No injuries were reported and only those four people who fell from the canoe ended up in the water. On Thursday, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Enforcement Division warned residents that ice conditions across the state had “changed markedly in recent days.” Even though temperatures have started to drop, [“ice conditions will remain poor](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1784238512094406) until there’s a string of cold days to form new, clear ice,” the department said in a message shared on Facebook. People were advised to always wait for “at least four inches of new, clear ice before walking out.”",
