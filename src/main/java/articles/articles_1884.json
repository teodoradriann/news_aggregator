    "title": "Lemon Orange Bundt Cake with Zesty Dairy-Free Appeal",
    "text": "Why stop with one type of citrus? This lemon orange bundt cake combines two zesty fruits into one delicious baked dessert. Using the juice and zest not only adds citrus flavor, it also helps to ensure a light and tender moist crumb without need for any dairy.\nDairy-Free Lemon Orange Bundt Cake with Optional Glaze\nThis recipe for lemon orange bundt cake was an entry in the\nSpring Fling Dairy-Free Recipe Contest that we cohosted with So Delicious many years ago. It was created and submitted by Michelle Hendrickson. We’ve updated her recipe with more details and also have answers to some FAQs below.\nI don’t have a Bundt Pan. Is there Another Pan I can use?\nYes, bundt cakes convert pretty well to other pans. You can use 2 (8×4-inch) loaf pans, 1 (9-inch or 10-inch) square pan, or a 1 (9-inch) tube pan. You might need to adjust the baking time a little for the different pan sizes.\nWhat is Coconut Milk Beverage?\nIt’s the drinkable type of coconut milk that’s sold in large cartons. You can find quart-sized aseptic packages in the middle aisles of grocery stores, often near the cereal or coffee sections. Or you can find refrigerated cartons near the dairy case, with other milk alternatives.\nCan I Substitute another Milk Alternative?\nYou can technically use another type of milk alternative, like almond milk, soy milk, rice milk, pea milk, or cashew milk. Michelle uses coconut milk beverage because the flavor of it melds well with the citrus flavors, and it is relatively rich.\nCan I use a Different Type of Dairy-Free Yogurt?\nYes, any type should work well, including almond milk yogurt or soy yogurt. Just be sure to pick a flavor that complements the orange and lemon flavors in this bundt cake.\nIs there a Substitute for the Dairy-Free Yogurt?\nYou could use 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the yogurt. In a pinch, you could probably use 1/3 cup more coconut milk beverage and/or citrus juice in place of the yogurt.\nIs the Vinegar Needed?\nTechnically, you really shouldn’t need the vinegar in this recipe. It’s used as an acid to help substitute for buttermilk and react with the baking soda to help the cake rise. But this lemon orange bundt cake recipe has several acidic ingredients, including the citrus and yogurt alternative. You can simply add a little more lemon or orange juice, if preferred.\nIs there a Butter Alternative you Recommend?\nI’ve been using Country Crock Plant Buttery Sticks lately because the are affordable, readily available, perform well, and have a nice slightly salty flavor that seems to enhance recipes. But most brands of dairy-free buttery sticks should work well in this recipe. Buttery spread might also work, but doesn’t tend to produce as light of a crumb.\nAren’t Eggs Dairy?\nYou’re in luck, eggs are in fact dairy-free! It’s a common misconception that eggs belong in the dairy family, but they are from chickens and chicken farms, not cows and dairy farms. For more information, see this post:\nAre Eggs Dairy?\nHow Can I Substitute the Eggs?\nThis is a very egg-reliant recipe, so it will be difficult to substitute the eggs and get the same result. The best substitute will probably be\naquafaba (about 1 cup), but I would also increase the baking powder to 1 teaspoon to help with the lift. But please note that this dairy-free lemon orange bundt cake recipe has not been tested without eggs.\nCan I Make this as a Gluten-Free Lemon Orange Bundt Cake?\nIt hasn’t been tested without gluten, but this cake should work okay without gluten since it is heavy in eggs. I would substitute your favorite gluten-free flour baking blend for the flour, like\nKing Arthur Measure for Measure. Do not substitute a single flour, you need a baking blend, and definitely do not substitute a grain-free flour, like coconut flour or almond flour. These are not 1:1 substitutes for all-purpose flour and would require many other changes to work properly.\nSpecial Diet Notes: Lemon Orange Bundt Cake\nBy ingredients, this recipe is dairy-free / non-dairy, nut-free, peanut-free, soy-free, and vegetarian.\n- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoons salt\n- ½ teaspoon baking soda\n- ½ teaspoon baking powder\n- ¾ cup vanilla coconut milk beverage\n- ½ (6-ounce) container dairy-free coconut milk yogurt (strawberry, vanilla, or key lime)\n- 1 orange, juice and zest\n- ½ lemon, juice and zest\n- 1 teaspoon white vinegar\n- 1¾ cups sugar\n- 1 cup (2 sticks) dairy-free buttery sticks\n- 5 eggs\n- Move the top oven rack to the middle of the oven, and then preheat your oven to 350ºF.\n- Grease and flour a 12-cup bundt pan.\n- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, bakingsoda, and baking powder.\n- In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk alternative, yogurt alternative, orange juice and zest, lemon juice and zest, and vinegar until smooth.\n- In a large mixing bowl, cream the sugar and buttery sticks with a hand mixer until the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is slightly pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\n- Add the eggs to the buttery mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n- Add about ⅓ of the coconut milk mixture to the buttery mixture and mix briefly to combine. Add ⅓ of the flour mixture and mix briefly to combine. Repeat this step two more times, until everything is just incorporated. Be careful not to over mix the ingredients.\n- Scrape the batter into your prepared bundt pan and even it out.\n- Bake the cake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.\n- Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Carefully turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.\nOptional Drizzly Icing: Once the bundt cake is completely cool, place 1 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl. Whisk in 1 tablespoon vanilla coconut milk beverage, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, or fresh squeezed orange juice until smooth. Whisk in additional liquid to get a more drizzly consistency, if desired. Drizzle the glaze over the cake. Optionally sprinkle the cake with additional orange zest and/or lemon zest as garnish.",

    "text": "Sciopero dei metalmeccanici per il nuovo contratto: “Più salario e più sicurezza”\n28 Marzo 2025 11:18\n“È stato necessario tornare a scioperare per i nostri diritti e per il futuro dell’intero settore”. Circa 200 metalmeccanici piacentini hanno partecipato al corteo colorato dalle bandiere di Fiom Cgil, Fim Cisl e Uilm Uil per rivendicare l’esigenza di far ripartire la negoziazione di un contratto collettivo nazionale giusto e dignitoso e “non calato dall’alto come quello che vorrebbero Federmeccanica e Unionmeccanica” affermano i sindacati.\nSalari, orario di lavoro e sicurezza\n“Il nuovo contratto deve prevedere quattro pilastri imprescindibili – spiega Andrea Cignatta, segretario di Uilm Piacenza – più salario, meno orario, meno precarietà e più sicurezza. Senza questi requisiti è impensabile andare avanti”.\nLa mobilitazione, organizzata a livello nazionale, è stata la diretta conseguenza della rottura del tavolo di trattativa con Federmeccanica (Confindustria) e Unionmeccanica (Confapi), che hanno respinto le richieste dei lavoratori e proposto una “contropiattaforma” inaccettabile. “Le proposte avanzate dalla controparte puntano a modificare le regole contrattuali in vigore, lasciando gli aumenti salariali legati esclusivamente all’inflazione e mettendo a rischio il potere d’acquisto dei metalmeccanici” spiega Paolo chiappa, segretario di Fiom Cgil Piacenza. “Ma ci sono anche altri temi delicati come la riduzione dell’orario del lavoro, la riduzione della precarietà e l’incremento della sicurezza nel mondo del lavoro” continua il segretario di Fiom Cgil Piacenza.\n“le richieste degli industriali sono irricevibili”\n“Le richieste degli industriali sono irricevibili sia dal punto di vista economico che normativo – afferma Nicholas Romiti, segretario di Fim Cisl Piacenza – Federmeccanica e Unionmeccanica non danno garanzie salariali di nessun tipo, non abbiamo nessuna certezza e quindi per i lavoratori si prospetta una retrocessione rispetto agli scorsi anni”, una retrocessione di diritti inaccettabile”.\nIl corteo è partito dall’incrocio tra Pubblico passeggio e Corso Vittorio Emanuele ed è arrivato davanti alla sede di Confindustria Piacenza tra cori, slogan, fischietti e tamburi con l’obiettivo di tenere alta l’attenzione sui diritti dei lavoratori: “Basta all’arroganza di Federmeccanica e Assistal che con la loro intransigenza e arroganza continuano ad impedire l’avvio della trattativa per il rinnovo del contratto nazionale – evidenziano i sindacati -, che mai come in questa fase può rappresentare l’antidoto alla crisi e alla riduzione dei volumi produttivi del Paese e può portare all’aumento del salario e del potere d’acquisto delle retribuzioni delle lavoratrici e dei lavoratori metalmeccanici oltre al miglioramento delle normative, che rappresentano un’irrinunciabile avanzamento dei diritti e delle condizioni di lavoro”.\n© Copyright 2025 Editoriale Libertà\nNOTIZIE CORRELATE",
