    "title": "The liberals want to give teachers more time for students: allocate 846 million Norwegian kroner",
    "text": "– Many teachers today find they have little time for an increasing number of tasks. It can go beyond the ability to see and track students who need it, education policy spokesperson and Venstre deputy leader Abid Raja tells NTB.\nToday, contact teachers have one hour a week that they can use to supervise students. The money the Liberal Party is proposing in its 2025 alternative budget would give teachers an extra hour a week starting next school year. On an annual basis, the measure will cost over two billion Norwegian kroner.\n– The teacher is one of the most important input factors in children’s education. For Venstre it is therefore important that teachers have more time to dedicate to students and this is why we are investing heavily in this concrete measure, explains Raja.\nRaja emphasizes that it is the parts of working life that negotiate the framework that determines how much time teachers have for the contact teacher function.\n– But when we know how important the role the contact teacher plays in solving the challenges we see in schools today, it is important that politicians also look at what means can be made available to give municipalities and county councils the opportunity to give the teacher more time to be a contact teacher, says Raja.\nIn his opinion, too many arrows point in the wrong direction in Norwegian schools.\n– There are various reasons for this, but what is certain is that to solve these challenges, to ensure that students grow and complete their education, money and measures are needed. I don’t think this government takes these challenges seriously enough, so we have to, he says.\n#liberals #give #teachers #time #students #allocate #million #Norwegian #kroner",

    "text": "CHANTILLY, Va. — A [16-year-old boy accused](https://www.google.com/search?q=wusa9+chantilly+sexual+assault&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS932US932&oq=wusa9+chantilly+sexual+assault&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGEAyBggDEEUYO9IBCDQwOTNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of breaking into a woman’s home in Chantilly and attempting to sexually assault her is in jail, according to Fairfax County Police. The 73-year-old victim told WUSA9 that the teen, whom she’d never met before, knocked on her door around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday. She assumed it was a neighbor who needed help, but once she opened her door, the victim said the suspect forced his way in and demanded her car keys. “I told him, ‘You have to leave, you have to leave,’” the victim recalled. “He started shoving me around. He was putting his hand over my face and tackling me from the back and shoved me into the bedroom and shoved me onto the bed.” The victim alleged the suspect threatened to rape her. “I was really struggling to keep him off of me,” she said. “I was struggling to keep him from grabbing my clothes.” Prior to being shoved in her bedroom, she called 911 using her landline. However, she claimed the teen knocked the phone out of her hand. Chief Kevin Davis said because he didn’t turn off the landline phone, the open line helped 911 operators guide officers to the home. “She answers the door with the 16-year-old standing immediately behind her who right off the bat, is pretending to be her grandson and trying to talk over the elderly woman at our patrol officers,” Davis said. Davis credited the officers for following their instincts and asking several questions before eventually detaining the teen suspect, whose name isn’t being released because of his age. The teen is charged with Burglary with the Intent to Rape, Abduction with the Intent to Defile, Preventing a 911 call, and Assault and Battery. “I'm very, very, very grateful,” the victim said. “I could've been very seriously hurt.” Detectives are asking anyone who has information about this incident to call our Major Crimes Bureau at 703-246-7800, option 3.

    "text": "Is Spirit Airlines Ghetto? A Review of the Low-Cost Carrier’s Services\nSpirit Airlines has long been a topic of debate in the world of air travel. For some, the low-cost carrier’s cheap fares and no-frills services are a blessing, providing access to affordable air travel without the hassle of traditional airlines. On the other hand, others view Spirit with disdain, labeling it as \"ghetto\" and associating it with undesirable amenities and experiences. But is it truly fair to call Spirit \"ghetto\"? In this article, we’ll delve into the world of low-cost air travel and evaluate Spirit Airlines’ services to help you decide for yourself.\nWhat Is \"Ghetto\" in the Context of Air Travel?\nBefore diving into the specifics of Spirit Airlines, it’s important to define what we mean by \"ghetto\" in the context of air travel. Ghetto, in this case, refers to a negative perception of an airline or service that is often associated with disarray, disorganization, and inconvenience. It’s a term that implies the airline is not providing a refined or premium experience, but rather catering to the lowest common denominator.\nSpirit Airlines: A Overview of the Low-Cost Carrier’s Services\nSpirit Airlines is a subsidiary of the US-based airline Fort Worth-based airline, Inc., which operates as a low-cost carrier (LCC) in the Latin American and North American markets. In operation since 1980, the airline is headquartered in Miramar, Florida, and operates a fleet of over 400 aircraft.\nServices and Fees\nSpirit Airlines is known for offering competitive fares , often below market average , making it a popular choice for budget-conscious travelers. However, passengers should be aware that these discounted fares often come with additional fees for services traditionally included in the ticket price, such as checked bags , priority boarding , and in-flight meals .\nHere are some examples of Spirit’s standard services and fees:\nService\nCost\nNotes\nChecked Bag\n$30-$65 per bag\nWeight and size restrictions apply\nPriority Boarding\n$10-$20 per person\nEarly access to the plane\nIn-flight Meal\n$3-$6 per meal\nSandwiches, snacks, and beverages for purchase\nSeat Selection\nFree (optional)\nChoose seats from a limited selection\nAdvanced Seat Selection\n$5-$40 per person\nReserve seats with a specific row and seat numbers\nTravel Insurance\nFree (optional)\nOptional insurance add-on for trip cancellations\nCredit Card Fees\n5-6%\nAdditional fee charged on credit card transactions\nIn-Cabin Experience\nSpirit’s aircraft interiors are designed to be functional rather than luxurious. Seats are relatively cramped, with 28-29 inches of legroom [1] , and overhead storage bins are limited. Food and beverages can only be purchased on board, and snacks and meals are limited to sandwich-like items and drinks.\nComplaints and Controversies\nWhile Spirit Airlines has its loyal customer base, it’s also faced numerous complaints and controversies in the past. Some of the most common complaints include:\nHidden fees : Charges for services like checked bags and seat selection can add to the overall cost of the ticket, making it harder for passengers to budget.\nDirty planes : Some passengers have reported unkempt aircraft, with trash and disorder in the cabins.\nPoor service : Some passengers have reported lack of attention from flight attendants, delays, and cancellations.\nConclusion: Is Spirit Airlines \"Ghetto\"?\nIn our review of Spirit Airlines, we can see that the airline is not just a budget-friendly option, but also packs a punch . While the airline’s services can be inconvenient and pricey , for some passengers, the low fare may outweigh the additional costs and inconvenience.\nUltimately, whether you find Spirit Airlines \"ghetto\" depends on your personal preferences and expectations from an airline . If you’re traveling with a lot of luggage, require multiple in-flight meals, or plan to book a premium seat, Spirit’s strict baggage policies and limited amenities might be frustrating. However, if you prioritize a cheap ticket and are willing to absorb some extra fees, Spirit might not be so bad.\nThe takeaway:\nSpirit Airlines may have its drawbacks, but is not inherently \"ghetto\". Consider the airline’s services and fees alongside your personal travel needs to gauge its suitability for your next journey.\nReferences:\n[1] Spirit Airlines: Seat Map and Seat Preferences.
