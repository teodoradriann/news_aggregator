    "text": "Meta announced Tuesday that it would end a fact-checking program for posts made to Facebook and Threads, a program launched in response to widespread misinformation posted during the 2016 election. The company is also adjusting its content moderation policy to be less restrictive.\nThe move was cheered by conservatives, who say fact-checking and moderation of users’ posts stifles free expression. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said that the company’s trust and safety teams will move from California to Texas.\nMeta, which owns Instagram, also made news this week for showing users AI-generated versions of themselves that people didn’t expect. Tech expert Omar Gallaga says Meta has turned more to the right, in response to the re-election of Donald Trump as president.\nHighlights from this segment:\n– Meta will no longer partner with organizations like PolitiFact to fact-check user posts believed to include misinformation.\n– Zuckerberg said in a video posted online that Meta would move more members of its trust and safety team from California to Texas, where Zuckerberg believes the teams would be perceived as less biased.\n– An Instagram user recently was surprised to receive an AI-generated ad containing an image of himself, situated among a large number of mirrors.",

    "title": "Commentary | By saying 'no' to Trump, Harvard saves its soul - Santa Cruz Sentinel",
    "text": "Harvard University just gave us all a lesson in how to answer a bully with one powerful word: “No.”\nThe Trump administration tried to intimidate Harvard — as it has so many government agencies, corporate executives, law firms and other universities — by threatening to cut off government money. In Harvard’s case, that meant a “review” of $8.7 billion in multiyear grants. The administration last week demanded a humiliating settlement that would have imposed an outside “audit” of faculty hiring, student admissions and other internal matters.\nHarvard refused to capitulate. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” wrote Harvard President Alan M. Garber on Monday. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”\nPresident Donald Trump doesn’t like “no” for an answer. So, on Monday night, the administration quickly followed through on its threats by freezing $2.2 billion in grants to the university. Harvard will suffer a world of pain as this First Amendment drama plays out. But in this graduate’s eyes, at least, the university has saved its everlasting soul.\nHarvard and many other great universities had seemed to be wandering in a wilderness of uncertainty and equivocation until Monday’s stand on principle. Free speech on campuses was imperiled from the left and right, especially after the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Jewish students felt threatened, and so did pro-Palestinian protesters. When university presidents tied to explain campus rules, they seemed incoherent.\n“Will Harvard Bend or Break?” was the title of a lengthy New Yorker article published last month. It explained how the Harvard Corporation, the university’s governing body, had suffered the embarrassment of appointing Claudine Gay as Harvard’s first Black president in July 2023, only to fire her six months later amid criticism of Harvard’s failure to curb antisemitism on campus and her alleged plagiarism.\nHarvard’s crisis deepened on March 31, when the White House announced its review of $8.7 billion in grants and then, on April 3, sent its first draft of settlement demands. To restore $400 million in threatened cuts, Columbia University had already caved to Trump’s demands.\nPenny Pritzker, a former Commerce secretary who’s the senior fellow of the corporation, struggled with her colleagues this month for consensus about Harvard’s values, its fears about the future and its red lines, a Harvard official told me. Through these discussions, one participant said, the corporation reflected on the meaning of Harvard’s Latin motto: Veritas, or “truth.”\nThe Trump administration’s diktat last Friday crossed that red line. Federal “investment” in Harvard through the billions in research grants wasn’t an “entitlement,” the April 11 letter warned. To “maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,” it must alter its governance, reduce the power of students and faculty, cease any racial or other preferences, and screen international students who are “supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism.”\nIt got worse: The government’s letter demanded that Harvard accept an outside audit of its students, faculty, staff and leadership to ensure “viewpoint diversity” — code for installing more pro-Trump voices. Whatever you think of Harvard’s skewed ideological mix (in a 2022 poll by the Harvard Crimson, more than 80% of the faculty described themselves as “liberal” or “very liberal”), this isn’t a problem the government should fix.\nThe corporation bravely rejected the deal, and within hours the administration froze the $2.2 billion in grants.\nFreedom isn’t free, as the saying goes. Harvard will now begin to pay what officials recognize is a very painful price for its independence. The university had a whopping $53.2 billion in its endowment as of last October, but much of that money is tied up in thousands of separate bequests and can’t be easily tapped.\nHarvard said last week that it plans to borrow $750 million to deal with its financial needs. But university officials told me private money won’t be able to make up the government shortfall — and Garber is already reckoning with the need for layoffs and budget cuts that will erode Harvard’s research mission, perhaps for years to come.\nWhat’s really going on in this battle for Harvard’s soul? Martin Wolf of the Financial Times argued recently that Trump, like Mao Zedong in China more than 50 years ago, has embarked on a “cultural revolution” that seeks “to overthrow the bureaucratic and cultural elites” that are anchored in the nation’s great universities.\nLiberal professors aren’t yet forced to wear dunce caps or work in “reeducation camps” in farms and factories. Maybe that’s next. For the moment, a salute to “Fair Harvard,” and how it’s living the motto, veritas.",

    "text": "METROPOLIS, IL — As many prepare for cold weather and snow, Project Hope Humane Society reminds pet owners to keep four-legged friends in mind. Susan Howell, a volunteer and board member at Project Hope Humane Society, said animals are at risk of cold-related injuries. \"Their bodies have trouble, you know, protecting themselves against cold. Plus, just like humans, they can get frostbite and everything else,\" said Howell. The humane society keeps many of their animals indoors already, but they are taking steps to block out the cold for some of their larger animals. Howell said those who have outdoor animals should bring them inside or make the proper adjustments. \"Just anything to kinda get them out of the wind, protect them, and if possible, get heat to them, and, of course, they need fresh water and food,\" said Howell. Howell stresses the importance of keeping food bowls full to provide extra calories during cold weather and ensuring your pet's water supply doesn't freeze. As for indoor animals, Howell said short bathroom breaks outside won't hurt them, but to try and keep them indoors as much as possible. Cat shelters can be made out of tubs or boxes stuffed with straw— providing a warm place to get out of the cold; for larger dogs, usually kept outside, bringing them in the garage is a good alternative if there isn't space in the house.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 15:52:00 The flood situation in parts of Germany remains tense. A key question is how much rain falls. The maps linked here show the water levels. The flood situation, especially in Lower Saxony, remains critical after days of continuous rain. “We have a very, very tense situation,” said the state’s Interior Minister, Daniela Behrens (SPD), on Deutschlandfunk on Friday. Almost all of Lower Saxony is under water. The approximately 100,000 personnel from, among others, the fire brigade and the Technical Relief Agency (THW) are deployed everywhere. The situation is also still tense in North Rhine-Westphalia. There is also a threat of new rain There is “really no relaxation in sight yet,” added Behrens. According to the weather forecast, there will be more rain and a storm in the next few days. That doesn’t ease the situation, but rather “exacerbates it in one place or another.” Due to flooding – New Year’s Eve fireworks are prohibited According to the administration, the flood situation was “still tense” in the Lower Saxony community of Lilienthal, for example. The city administration there banned the setting off of fireworks on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Eve with the help of a general decree – in order to protect the emergency services from additional operations. According to the fire department, the situation in the town of Flotwedel in the Lower Saxony district of Celle was also “still critical”. The flood operation is continuing, it was said. On Thursday evening, residents of individual streets were evacuated and mobile dike systems were also set up. Those: [Cross-border flood portal](https://www.hochwasserzentralen.de/warnungen)as of December 29, 2023, 2:58 p.m., no data for NRW The map of [Cross-state flood portal ](https://www.hochwasserzentralen.de/warnungen)shows where flooding is expected today. In the areas marked red there is an official warning for major floods; in regions marked orange there is a conventional flood warning. In the dashed areas there is an advance warning from the responsible authorities. You can breathe deeply in green regions. An all-clear could be issued here. There is no warning in white areas. No data can currently be collected for North Rhine-Westphalia. In Meppen in Emsland, dikes were also reinforced during the night: around 400 emergency services built mobile dikes there. The local administration said there is still a risk of flooding due to the weakening of the dikes. However, the situation has stabilized. In Oldenburg, the fire department reported “a slight drop in water levels” – although more rain is expected in the coming days. It was said that a dike had not yet broken. However, in the Sandkrug district of Hatten in the Oldenburg district, the dikes continued to be reinforced, and a Bundeswehr helicopter was also scheduled to be deployed on Friday. The Hanover police reported a canoe missing with two people. This was discovered in the flood area of the River Leine, but was then no longer seen. The fire department initiated a search, but so far it has not been successful. In North Rhine-Westphalia the situation is calming down a little In North Rhine-Westphalia, the situation has temporarily eased somewhat – but according to the Environment Ministry, it is “at a high level”. Almost half of the levels are still within the warning levels. Very high levels continued to be measured on the Weser in East Westphalia. The Ministry of the Environment there has not yet given the all-clear for the most populous federal state. “We still have a major flood situation,” said NRW Environment Minister Oliver Krischer (Greens) on Friday in Düsseldorf. So far the consequences have remained manageable and there have been no casualties. There is no risk of dam failure at the dams, nor an uncontrolled overflow. The flood protection systems would have held. Levels in Dresden remain below the six meter mark In eastern Germany, many fire brigades were still in constant operation on Friday. At least there was some good news from Dresden. In the Saxon state capital, the Elbe remained below the expected six meter water level. Two meters is normal. The water level of the Elbe has been falling again since Friday night, according to data from the state flood center. The Elbe briefly reached a level of 5.95 meters. Dresden’s environmental mayor Eva Jähnigen (Greens) explained on Deutschlandfunk this morning that alert level 3 should be reduced over the course of Friday. All protective measures have been effective and there has been no major damage so far. In the north of Thuringia, a dike on the Helme River was opened in a controlled manner to avert the risk of flooding on the state border between Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. The Kyffhäuserkreis district announced on Friday night that the water was now flowing into fields. The opening was necessary because water had been specifically drained from the overloaded Kelbra reservoir for several days and the helmets were therefore carrying a lot of water. The highest flood alert level 4 has been in effect for the Helmets for two days. According to the district, firefighters have laid around 6,000 sandbags since Thursday to protect the small town of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth and to raise the dikes.

The water from the helmets is draining “as planned,” said a spokesman for the Kyffhäuserkreis district office. But there is still no complete all-clear. The water level in the helmets is constantly monitored and a district crisis team is still in action. The Pretzien weir near Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt was opened on Thursday. This means that around a third of the Elbe’s water is channeled past the two cities through a flood canal and over meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.

    "text": "Un expert en cybersécurité explique pourquoi une faille de 7-Zip jugée mineure est en réalité dangereuse pour les utilisateurs. Heureusement, un correctif est disponible. N'attendez pas pour l'installer.\nCrédits : 123RF À un moment ou un autre, tous les logiciels présentent des vulnérabilités . Parfois dès leur lancement, souvent après une mise à jour. Quelle que soit son origine, le but est toujours de la combler via le déploiement d'un correctif.\nPour savoir à quel point il est urgent de le faire, les experts attribuent un score à chaque faille. Appelé CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), c'est une échelle allant de 0,1 à 10. Suivant la note, on parle de sévérité faible, moyenne, haute ou critique.\nUn score CVSS bas ne signifie pas qu'il faut négliger la correction de la faille. Juste que s'il y en a une autre plus grave, c'est sur elle que les développeurs se pencheront en premier. Globalement, le système fonctionne, mais il arrive parfois que les spécialistes ne soient pas d'accord sur la note définie.\nLe chercheur en cybersécurité Landon l'a fait savoir sur Seclists à propos de la faille CVE-2025-55188 découverte par ses soins dans le programme de compression de fichiers 7-Zip. Elle a reçu un score CVSS de 2,7 (faible sévérité), alors que selon lui, son exploitation par une personne mal intentionnée peut faire des ravages .\nMettez le logiciel 7-Zip à jour, cette faille peut avoir des conséquences désastreuses Pour faire simple, la vulnérabilité permet à un attaquant de rediriger les fichiers présents dans archive 7-Zip où il veut lors de son extraction . Il peut par exemple placer un programme malveillant dans les fichiers système de Windows, ou remplacer l'un d'eux par un autre, accordant au pirate des accès qu'il ne devrait pas avoir. Cela nécessite de remplir certaines conditions, mais ça reste possible.\nSur Linux en revanche, il n'y a pas de garde-fou. Vous décompressez une archive que l'on vous a envoyé en pensant qu'elle est sans risque, et son contenu va se loger dans des endroits sensibles. Au pire, le pirate peut alors prendre le contrôle de votre machine , au mieux empêcher le fonctionnement d'un service.\nEn résumé, c'est le même genre de faille que celle découverte récemment dans WinRAR , autre célèbre logiciel de compression/décompression. Comme pour ce dernier, la dernière version de 7-Zip corrige heureusement le tir : installez la version 25.01 du programme et vous serez tranquille.",

    "text": "Another in a series of unusually strong solar storms hitting Earth produced stunning skies full of pinks, purples, greens and blues farther south than normal, including into parts of Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.\\n“It was a pretty extensive display yet again,” said Shawn Dahl, a space weather forecaster at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. He said the center has gotten reports of northern lights sightings as far south as New Mexico. “It’s been a wonderful year.”\\nThere were no immediate reports of disruptions to power and communications.\\nNOAA issued a severe geomagnetic storm alert on Wednesday after after an outburst from the sun was detected earlier in the week. Such a storm increases the chance of auroras — also known as northern lights — and can temporarily disrupt power and radio signals.\\nNOAA’s Friday forecast shows continued higher-than-normal activity, but the chances for another overnight show are slim farther south of Canada and the northern Plains states.\\nWhat causes northern lights?\\nThe sun sends more than heat and light to Earth — it sends energy and charged particles known as the solar wind. But sometimes that solar wind becomes a storm. The sun’s outer atmosphere occasionally “burps” out huge bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections. They produce solar storms, also known as geomagnetic storms, according to NOAA.\\nThe Earth’s magnetic field shields us from much of it, but particles can travel down the magnetic field lines along the north and south poles and into Earth’s atmosphere.\\nWhen the particles interact with the gases in our atmosphere, they can produce light — blue and purple from nitrogen, green and red from oxygen.\\nDahl said this storm generated a particularly vibrant display when it hit because the orientation of the storm’s magnetism lined up well with the Earth’s. “We stayed well connected,” he said.\\nWhy have there been so many solar storms lately?\\nSolar activity increases and decreases in a cycle that last about 11 years, astronomers say. The sun appears to be near the peak of that cycle, known as a solar maximum.\\nIn May, the sun shot out its biggest flare in almost two decades. That came days after severe solar storms pummeled Earth and triggered auroras in unaccustomed places across the Northern Hemisphere.\\nThere will likely be more to come. Dahl said we remain “in the grip” of the solar maximum and it isn’t likely to start to fade until early 2026.\\n“We’re in for more of the experiences we had last night,” he said.\\nHow can you best see the northern lights?\\nNOAA advises those who hope to see the northern lights to get away from city lights.\\nThe best viewing time is usually within an hour or two before or after midnight, and the agency says the best occasions are around the spring and fall equinoxes due to the way the solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetic field.",
