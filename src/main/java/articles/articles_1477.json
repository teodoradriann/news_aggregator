    "text": "The money was splashed on nine foreign jaunts in the 12 months to October\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has racked up a bill of more than £125,000 in a single year to jet around the globe.\nThe money was splashed on nine foreign jaunts in the 12 months to October, details of his official expenses obtained under Freedom of Information rules show.\nIt means that in just one year Sir Lindsay has gone through half the £250,000 his predecessor John Bercow took ten years to spend on globe-trotting.\nCritics today said that, for someone whose job it is to sit in a chair and largely keep quiet, taxpayers would find the bill ‘difficult to swallow’.\nAmong the more eye-catching foreign travel bills was £40,599 – including £33,400 on premium or business-class flights – for a four-day trip to Australia.\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle (pictured) has racked up a bill of more than £125,000 in a single year to jet around the globe\nIt means that in just one year Sir Lindsay has gone through half the £250,000 his predecessor John Bercow (pictured) took ten years to spend on globe-trotting\nIt was to attend the Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth in Canberra in January with two staff.\nThe bill also included £4,702 on ‘ground transportation’ and £682 on ‘meals’.\nA five-day trip to Ottawa in Canada this summer to meet his counterpart came in at £23,571, including nearly £15,000 on flights and £8,650 on hotels.\nAnd taxpayers were billed £24,657 for a three-day jaunt to Japanese capital Tokyo for the G7 Speakers’ Conference in September, including £21,312 on flights and £3,300 on hotels.\nA trip to the G20 Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit in Jakarta, Indonesia, in November 2022 followed by a visit to Sir Lindsay’s counterpart in Singapore came with a price tag of nearly £25,000.\nThis included nearly £19,000 on flights, £5,190 on accommodation and £410 for a photographer.\nThousands of pounds was also spent on an ‘official visit’ to the Caribbean island of Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory, and giving a speech at the University of Southern California.\nWhile flights and hotels for the latter trip were covered by the university, it is unclear if the £3,169 bill for ‘ground transportation’ was. Sir Lindsay also flew to Gibraltar and Dublin in the 12-month period.\nSir Lindsay took a five-day trip to Ottawa in Canada this summer to meet his counterpart Anthony Rota (pictured) came in at £23,571\nSeparately, he spent £101,552 – including £47,962 on flights – sponsoring a ‘Speakers of the UK House of Commons and Overseas Territories’ conference on the paradise Caribbean island of Anguilla.\nHe attended the three-day conference, which made £12,000 income from ‘conference observer’ fees, with two staff.\nDuring the period, Sir Lindsay also accepted £1,000-worth of hospitality and tickets from Formula One for the Silverstone Grand Prix, £600-worth of hospitality from the Concours d’Elegance automotive display at Hampton Court Palace and £1,717-worth of hospitality from The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.\nHe racked up taxi bills of £621 this year and £995 last year, according to the data released after FOI request by the Mail.\nSir Lindsay, who is the MP for Chorley and is entitled to a £163,000-a-year salary, has also spent tens of thousands of pounds laying on drinks and canapés receptions over the last year.\nThese include £4,100 on a reception to mark ‘LGBT History Month’ and £3,500 on a retirement party for former Clerk of the House Sir John Benger.\nIt comes after it emerged in October that taxpayers have been billed £7million to refurbish the grace-and-favour Speaker’s House since Sir Lindsay came into office.\nThe sum has been spent on renovations of the Grade-I listed building, located in the New Palace of Westminster, since November 2019.\nSir Lindsay also accepted £1,000-worth of hospitality and tickets from Formula One for the Silverstone Grand Prix (pictured)\nWith more than £1 million spent per year on the works since the Speaker took office, the bill appears to dwarf those of previous refurbishments.\nIt is unknown exactly how much of the money was spent on furnishings and how much went towards structural improvements.\nJohn O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will find these enormous expenses difficult to swallow.\n‘The Speaker’s role is a significant one, and cannot necessarily be done on the cheap, but that doesn’t give anyone in the role a blank cheque.\n‘All politicians should remember that each penny spent fulfilling their duties is ultimately billed to taxpayers, including their own constituents.’\nSir Lindsay was installed as Speaker in November 2019 but has done the vast majority of foreign travel within the last 12 months or so due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHis predecessor Mr Bercow came under fire for some of his spending during his ten-year tenure chairing Commons debates.\nHe flew almost 207,000 miles and his globe-trotting cost £250,000. His most expensive trip was to Burma and New Zealand in July 2013, costing £41,000 for him, three staff members and three MPs.\nA House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Speaker is a representative for the House of Commons and has a responsibility to explain and promote the work of the House, representing it at high-profile state events and inter-parliamentary conferences – both across the Commonwealth and around the world.\n‘To meet these responsibilities, transport arrangements are made by the Speaker’s Office, with value for money and security the primary considerations.’",

    "text": "Creating an effective \"template of obituary\" is a meaningful way to honor the memory of a loved one who has passed away. An obituary serves not only as an announcement of death but also as a tribute to the life and legacy of the deceased. In this article, we will discuss how to craft a compassionate and respectful \"template of obituary,\" ensuring that we use the phrase \"template of obituary\" appropriately throughout.\nWhat are different available sizes for Obituary Templates?\nObituary Templates different sizes available\nObituaries Templates are available in different sizes, with the most common being 1-up (an 8.5 x 11-inch paper folded in half) and 2-up (two programs printed on an 8.5 x 11-inch paper and folded in half). The finished size for a 1-up program when folded is 5.5 x 8.5 inches, and for a half-page program, it is 4.25 x 5.5 inches.\nYou can choose to have a border or not, but only if you are printing it at a local printer.\nUnderstanding the Role of an Obituary\nAn obituary is more than just a death notice; it's a narrative that chronicles the life, accomplishments, and the personal connections of the deceased. The \"template of obituary\" should be structured in a way that captures the essence of the person's life, offering a glimpse into who they were and the impact they had on others.\nKey Components of a Template of Obituary\n1. Introduction: The \"\ntemplate of obituary\" should begin with the full name of the deceased, including any nicknames, their age, place of residence, and the date and place of death.

Life Story: This is the heart of the \"template of obituary.\" It should detail significant life events, achievements, and qualities of the deceased. Focus on what made them unique, such as their hobbies, passions, or impact on their community.\n3. Family Information: A vital part of any \"template of obituary\" is the listing of surviving family members as well as those who have predeceased the individual. This section acknowledges close family ties and honors those who were significant in the person's life.\n4. Service Details: The \"template of obituary\" should include information about the time, date, and location of the funeral service, wake, or memorial, as well as any other relevant details for attendees.\n5. Special Messages: Often, families wish to include special messages in the \"template of obituary,\" such as expressions of gratitude towards medical staff or caregivers, or information about charities for memorial donations.\nWriting the Obituary\nWhen writing an obituary using the \"\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kMtRun-dn6arN0aq9tiXSNeVEKpRtM8K?usp=sharing,\" it's important to:\n- Be Respectful and Honest: Convey the personality and life story of the deceased with respect and sincerity.\n- Keep It Concise: While it's important to include key details, the obituary should be concise and readable.\nclick here\n- Review and Edit: Ensure that the obituary is free from errors and is a fitting tribute to your loved one.",

    "text": "BioNTech(BNTX) Shares Soar 14.94% on Positive Trial Results\nBioNTech(BNTX) shares surged 14.94% intraday, marking the highest level since February 2025, with a 9.70% increase, extending its winning streak to four consecutive days, and a 16.88% gain over the past four days.\nBioNTech's recent stock price surge can be attributed to several key factors. The company's Phase 2 trial results for BNT327, a treatment for small-cell lung cancer, have shown promising outcomes. These results have significantly boosted investor confidence in BioNTech's biotechnology capabilities, driving up the stock price.\nInstitutional investors have also played a role in the stock's recent performance. Morgan Stanley raised its price target for [biontech] to $140, maintaining an Overweight rating. Similarly, H.C. Wainwright adjusted its target to $145, keeping a Buy rating. These adjustments reflect institutional trust in BioNTech's strategic direction and have likely contributed to increased investor interest.\nAdditionally, the market is eagerly awaiting BioNTech's first-quarter 2025 financial results, scheduled to be announced on May 5, 2025. This upcoming report is expected to provide insights into the company's performance and could further influence the stock price.\nBioNTech's strategic advancements have also garnered attention. The company has seen a 2.9% increase in European equities converted to ADRs in the US, indicating growing investor confidence in its strategic ventures and innovations.",

    "text": "Over 20 istriwallahs in the Mahadevpura area were given eco-friendly LPG iron boxes at an event by Udhyam Learning Foundation and Whitefield Rising, a community group.\nThe event, held on Thursday, is part of Udhyam’s Istri Project, which has helped over 6,000 istri vyapaaris (vendors who press clothes for a living) swap coal iron boxes for LPG-enabled boxes.\n“Coal iron boxes take close to an hour to heat up and they typically have to set it up twice a day. That means they lose two hours a day just setting up the box,” says Sekhar Sahoo, marketing manager at Udhyam. LPG boxes will heat up within two minutes and can be switched off as and when needed. “Many of the istriwallahs are unable to take a break once they start their shift because they cannot step away from the coal boxes,” explains Sahoo.\nAccording to a survey, the added two hours a day amounts to additional revenue of Rs 50,000 per year per vendor. It is also less expensive than coal, Sahoo says. “Coal takes longer to heat and so more of it is needed for the same amount of clothes. Currently, other istriwallahs who have switched to LPG boxes are using five-litre cylinders, which are replaced roughly every 10 days,” he elaborates.\nThe LPG boxes, which cost around Rs 6,000, have a burner inside and a small opening to let in oxygen. Sahoo shares that these boxes eliminate smoke. They are also equipped with a regulator to control the heat.\nUdhyam is currently in talks with the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation to get more istri vyapaaris onto LPG iron boxes.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 04 July 2024, 23:39 IST",

    "text": "Read full article The Independent How Gareth Southgate changed England fortunes and rebranded patriotism richard jolly Fri, 12 Jul 2024, 9:17 am · 5-\nSouthgate, you’re the one. The one manager in England ’s century and a half of playing international football to take them to two finals. The only one to reach a final on foreign soil . The one who, if Spain are beaten in Berlin on Sunday, will have a claim to dislodge Sir Alf Ramsey from the top of the list of England managers.\nWin Euro 2024 and it will complete an eight-year journey for Gareth Southgate ; one of largely smooth, and sometimes unexpected, progress over the first five years, but a rockier ride during the last three, when there have been questions if the manager who took England forwards has then taken them back again.\nSlovakia could have been his Iceland, almost bringing England back to 2016. Southgate’s reign has felt in endgame every game; because of some of the hostility from outside, because of his restlessness, because of the pressure he has put on himself. He has remained the FA’s ideal manager, but with the possibility he could sack himself.\nThe manager who has been criticised for his apparent inability to change games when his sides lost leads in the past has instead seen them mount a series of comebacks: trailing to Slovakia, Switzerland and Netherlands , overcoming each after extra time, via penalties and with a 90th-minute winner respectively.\nSouthgate has triumphed with his substitutions, but also with his non-substitutions, such as keeping the eventual scorers Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham on against Slovakia. He has been ruthless at times, loyal at others. He has shifted system: mid-match at times and then with a switch to a back three from the quarter-finals.\nGareth Southgate brings on Cole Palmer (left) for Phil Foden in what proved a crucial moment (Getty Images)\nAll of which is an indication that Southgate has made a greater impact than is often acknowledged. He is underestimated; by the rest of Europe, perhaps, amid some scathing verdicts, but also by many in the England support. The image has seemed cemented that a great group of players are being held back by a mediocre manager.\nSouthgate can often be a voice of reason; he has been while speaking of English “entitlement”, in offering reminders that other countries have fine footballers, too.\nHe is tougher than the image of the Marks and Spencer-wearing eminently nice uncle would suggest, sensitive enough to be hurt by the brickbats. “We all want to be loved, right?” he said after the semi-final victory in Dortmund . “So when you are doing something for your country and you are a proud Englishman and you don’t feel that back and all you read is criticism, it is hard.”\nSouthgate had cans of beer thrown at him after the draw with Slovenia. His name has been booed before games. In the nadir of his reign, 2022’s 4-0 thrashing by Hungary, he was ambushed with chants accusing him of not knowing what he was doing. It explains why he considered making the Qatar World Cup his last tournament, why he said two years ago he would not “outstay my welcome”. If Euro 2024 has lent itself to different conclusions, now it is apparent he has not.\nGareth Southgate celebrates England’s Euro 2024 semi-final win over the Dutch (Getty Images)\nOn Wednesday, he described himself as a “kindred spirit” of the fans; it is only partially true in that he reflects some but not others. He has tried to rebrand patriotism, with thoughtfulness, inclusivity and an emotional intelligence that contributes to his understanding of his players.\nIt is often, and accurately, said that Southgate is not instinctively a managerial genius. He is not; but he is a careful planner who has learnt. If attention to detail in preparation accounted for some of his successes, whether England’s improved record in penalty shootouts or the “love train”, the set-piece routines of the 2018 World Cup, Euro 2024 has brought better in-game changes. Southgate is evolving.\nHe is called a lucky manager. England landed in the much weaker half of the draw. Over their first five games in Germany , they prevailed without excelling. Yet there were conditions where an exit could have been attributed to bad luck: the injuries to Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire that stripped him of half of his first-choice defence, those to Bukayo Saka , Kieran Trippier and Kane that meant none began the tournament in top shape, the way the tactically important pair of Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips became unselectable, the troubled seasons of Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount and Jack Grealish that meant players with a significance in the past were all omitted.\nEngland’s squad is recognised as a strong group, yet key players are missing (Getty Images)\nThe context, too, was that England have been burdened by their own ambition. “We came here to make history,” Southgate said after beating the Dutch. Such talk is not new; his England have been open in their aims, even when scarcely playing like potential champions. His age of innocence is over, the early optimism replaced by a more toxic climate.\nAnd yet here England are, back in another final, the Southgate revolution again one game from completing a transformation in the fortunes of the national team. It would be a singular achievement that perhaps only one man could have accomplished.",

    "text": "La caridad abre el camino a la esperanza\nMario Alcudia explica por qué debemos celebrar la caridad en este domingo del Corpus Christi\nTiempo de lectura: 2’\nEstamos celebrando la semana, podríamos denominar, de la Caridad que culminará mañana con la festividad del Corpus, que en algunasdiócesis se celebraba el Jueves. Ese mismo día vimos en nuestras calles a miles de voluntarios con sus tradicionales huchas de Cáritas y es que no hay mejor forma de recordarnos lo que es la Caridad que hacerlo en torno al Cuerpo y a la Sangre de Cristo.\nDesde Cáritas nos recuerdan que el bien, el amor, la justicia y la solidaridad han de ser conquistados cada día; lo hacen con una Campaña que tiene como lema “Allí donde nos necesitas, abrimos caminos a la esperanza”; una invitación a salir al encuentro de los demás, especialmente, de las personas más pobres; comprometerse con el bien común y cultivar la solidaridad en comunidad.\nSe trata de caminar y acompañar a quienes padecen dificultades en su vida\nHacer y considerar ese sufrimiento de otros un asunto un poco nuestro, intentando cada uno, con nuestra actuación, ofrecer nuestro apoyo, amor y esperanza construyendo así un camino hacia un futuro mejor. Como dice la secretaria general de esta Cáritas Madrid, consiste en hacer visible el Amor con mayúsculas, convirtiéndonos en parte activa de esa misión que empezó el Señor.\nNuestro compromiso es vivir y estar en el mundo desde el amor, especialmente allá donde se nos necesita. Los cristianos estamos llamados a ser la comunidad fraterna y samaritana. Ya esto lo decía san Pablo en su carta a los Corintios: la caridad es el camino más perfecto para conocer a Dios y comprender qué es lo esencial de la vida cristiana.\nAsí pues, conviene tener muy presente eso que nos recuerda el Papa, que la comunión en Cristo y en la Iglesia es la que anima, acompaña y sostiene el servicio de la caridad. La diaconía de la caridad se convierte en un instrumento visible de comunión en la Iglesia. Abramos con nuestro testimonio y ejemplo esos caminos de esperanza.",

    "title": "Putting God First: The Key to a Fulfilled Life",
    "text": "In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s easy to lose sight of what truly matters. As we navigate through the complexities and challenges, the concept of putting God first emerges as a beacon of guidance and peace. But what are the steps to putting God first, and how can it transform our lives?\nWhat Does Putting God First Look Like?\nPutting God first means that in every aspect of our lives—be it decisions, relationships, or priorities—God’s presence and principles guide our actions and choices. It’s about aligning our will with God’s, seeking his kingdom before\nour own ambitions or desires. This fundamental shift in perspective leads to a life filled with purpose, peace, and contentment.\nTo truly prioritize God, integrate spiritual practices into your daily life. Begin your day with prayer, seeking God’s guidance and expressing gratitude. Make Scripture reading a non-negotiable part of your routine, allowing God’s Word to shape your day. In decision-making, ask yourself what aligns with God’s will, and seek counsel from the Holy Spirit.\nRELATED:\nThe Goal of Spiritual Practices Psalm 1:2 and 1 Thessalonians 2:4 provide insight into prioritizing God, highlighting the importance of delighting in His Word and seeking to please God above all.\nPutting God first in a relationship means building it on the foundation of God’s love and principles. Communicate openly about faith, support each other’s spiritual growth, and center your relationship around God’s purpose.\n5 Ways to Put God First\n- Love God Wholeheartedly: Jesus states that the greatest commandment is to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind (\nMatthew 22:37). This means devoting every aspect of our lives to God’s service and glory.\n- Pray Continuously:\n1 Thessalonians 5:17encourages us to “pray without ceasing.” Regular communication with God through prayer strengthens our relationship with Him and acknowledges His sovereignty in our lives.\n- Meditate on His Word: Regularly reading and reflecting on Scripture allows God’s Word to guide our thoughts, actions, and decisions.\n- Trust in His Plan:\nProverbs 3:5-6advises us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and not rely on our understanding, acknowledging Him in all our ways.\n- Prioritize God in Your Life: This involves rearranging our daily routines and commitments to ensure that time with God is not just another item on our to-do list but a central focus.",
