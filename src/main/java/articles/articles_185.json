    "text": "3月28日消息，微博话题“佛山一公司要求员工每月加班10晚以上”冲上热搜榜，引发热议。\n据媒体报道，网曝佛山汇创塑料模具有限公司发通知称， 要求员工每月至少要加班10晚以上。\n根据网友晒出的通知单， 4月份起，每个员工每月要加班10晚以上，不足10晚的员工社保规定个人出的部分自己出，加班时间是18:30至21:30。\n对此，涉事公司公司回应称，这是自愿加班，你也可以不加班，但是如果你不加班，规定个人缴纳的社保自己缴，个人缴纳的社保大概400多元，如果你符合加班规定，自己缴纳的社保我们来缴纳，另外你也可以赚加班费，还能拿提成。\n在话题下，有网友表示“很离谱”。天眼查显示，佛山市汇创塑料模具有限公司成立于2016年，注册地址位于佛山市顺德区，法定代表人是梁庭轩，注册资本是50万元。其经营范围包括生产、加工、销售、维修模具、塑料及制品（不含废旧塑料）等等。",

    "text": "Israel’s land invasion of Rafah, which was awaited with fear for months, began by taking over the Philadelphia corridor on the Egyptian border. Israeli tanks entered the Rafah border gate on the corridor at the beginning of May, violating the historic agreement signed in 1979.\nEgypt, which has repeatedly warned Tel Aviv not to attack Rafah, which is located in the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip, changed its opinion about staying on the corridor, she sent troops to the border and announced that she would intervene in a genocide case at the International Court of Justice.\nWhile the death of an Egyptian soldier in the conflict that began in the Philadelphia corridor in May increased tension, Israel who is currently living is not considering withdrawing from the border.\nFollowing US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s Middle East tour, which included Tel Aviv, Cairo and Doha, Israeli state television KAN reported that Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to withdraw from the Philadelphia Corridor .\nOn the other hand, Netanyahu denied the news on Wednesday night and said that there was no such agreement at the meeting with Blinken, where they discussed the ceasefire and exchange talks. hospitality.\nThe Philadelphia Corridor between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is a buffer zone 14 kilometers long and several hundred meters wide.\nWith Israel occupying the corridor, the Gaza Strip’s communications with the outside world were effectively cut off.\nIn the current picture, it seems that the removal of Israeli occupation troops from the corridor is one of the most important nodes in the negotiations. Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip as well as Egypt, wants Israeli troops to leave the corridor.\nThe passage was also on the agenda during the phone conversation between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the early hours of Thursday.\nUS officials speaking to The Washington Post said Netanyahu had offered concessions to Biden, but a diplomatic source speaking anonymously to Israeli media today argued that Tel Aviv did not change to stand\nThe Qatar newspaper Al Arabi Al Jadid wrote about another offer brought to the table by Secretary of State Blinken, who met with the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah Sisi in Cairo during the week.\nAccording to the newspaper, Blinkenn asked Sisi to join the international peacekeeping force that will be in the Philadelphia corridor.\nThe US proposal includes giving Israel leadership positions in the task force that will be deployed along the 14-kilometer line.\nThere is still no word from Cairo regarding that news and offer.\nIsrael, which constantly adds new conditions to the indefinite ceasefire talks, refuses to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Gaza Strip in two as well as the Philadelphia Corridor. The Netzarim Corridor was created by Israeli occupation forces during the war to separate northern and southern Gaza.\n2024-08-22 19:42:00\n#BREAKING #NEWS #ISRAEL #terrible #passage #offer #revealed #Sisi",

    "text": "Thanks to a bit of a hot streak, Coby White and the Chicago Bulls have forced their way into the play-in conversation in the Eastern Conference. White recently earned high marks in the East, being named the Player of the Week for last week after averaging almost 28 points per game. That has helped the Bulls play a whole lot better as of late.\nSince the All-Star Break, NBA defenses have often sent their best defenders to guard Coby White, and those defenders have had one goal in mind: prevent the three-point shot. White, in turn, is taking over two more attempts per game at the rim than before the break.\n“A lot of teams now have been trying to run me off the line, especially in transition,” White said to the Chicago Tribune. “I’m just taking what the defense gives me.” A career 36.7% three-point shooter, White has had to adapt, and he’s done a brilliant job of that.\n“Early on, a lot of teams were bullying us, to be honest. I think as a team, we kind of got tired of it. We see what happens when we consistently put forth the effort to be physical on both ends of the floor. It’s been working out in our favor,” White added. The Bulls traded away their top scorer Zach LaVine and have adopted a new, aggressive offensive strategy. White has fully bought in.\nWhite nearly won Most Improved Player of the Year last year, and an even better 2025 suggests that it was not a fluke. The improvement is very evident. The former UNC guard admitted that he had to get a lot better to get to this point as an NBA player.\n“I wasn’t very good when I came into the league,” he went on. “I had a lot to learn. I knew that. It was all about humbling myself to the point where I looked in the mirror and said: ‘I have to get better. I have to get stronger. I have to be more physical. I have to figure out who I am as a player.”\nWhite added, “It was hard to humble myself and ask those questions, but it needed to be done.” The Bulls guard is averaging 19.5 points per game, a career-high. He’s also added 3.6 rebounds per game and 4.5 assists to keep the Bulls afloat.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily.

    "text": "De um lado, canal promove a diversidade sexual nas novelas; do outro, erra com atitude conservadora que invisibiliza gays, lésbicas e afins Não chega a causar surpresa o cancelamento da exibição na próxima quinta-feira (30) de episódio da série sobre a relação dos LGBTs com a cidade de São Paulo no telejornal ‘SP1’, com o repórter declaradamente gay Rômulo D’Ávila. O canal alega ter sido uma decisão editorial. E podemos acreditar. O problema está na motivação. O material pró-diversidade sexual e de gênero iria ao ar no Feriado de Corpus Christi, um dos principais da Igreja Católica, e da Marcha para Jesus de SP, maior manifestação de rua dos evangélicos. Na prática, a Globo demonstra não querer ofender ou provocar as duas maiores correntes religiosas do país. Tal atitude mostra olhar equivocado da emissora sobre a comunidade do arco-íris – tratada, neste caso, como ultrajante aos praticantes da fé – e explícita incoerência com a própria programação. Por acaso, nos dias de protagonismo dos católicos e evangélicos, a emissora vai proibir também a aparição dos personagens LGBTs nas novelas, como a Buba de ‘Renascer’ e o Kleberson de ‘Família é Tudo’? Esconderá os jornalistas ativistas da causa anti-homotransfobia, como Marcelo Cosme do ‘Em Pauta’ e ‘Jornal Hoje’? Irá proibir entrevistados afeminados nos telejornais? Drags como Pabllo Vittar estarão proibidas de aparecer nos programas? Será um dia sem gays, lésbicas, trans e afins em sua tela? Essa atitude hipócrita da Globo serve apenas para manchar sua imagem e enfraquecer a imparcialidade de seu jornalismo. O apagamento de um grupo para agradar a outros, ainda que apenas por 1 dia, revela falta de isenção e visão moralista de mundo. Com DNA católico de fundação e tentando flertar com evangélicos por interesse de audiência, o canal indica disposição de acender quantas velas for necessário para diminuir sua rejeição nas igrejas mais poderosas. Logo depois, em 2 de junho, voltará a ser progressista de carteirinha ao cobrir a Parada Gay de SP. Afinal, os “desviados de Deus” são fundamentais para seu engajamento on-line e a política de inclusão exigida pelos grandes anunciantes dos intervalos da TV.
