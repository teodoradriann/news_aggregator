    "title": "'The worst possible time of year': Doctors warn about asthma inhaler switch coming in January",
    "text": "Manufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent.\nStarting January 1, a drug that thousands of patients depend on to help them breathe will disappear from pharmacy shelves, and doctors are concerned patients may have delays switching to alternatives and getting them covered by insurance.\nManufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent, and instead is making an \"authorized generic\" version, which is identical but without the same branding.\nPhysicians who treat patients with asthma say the authorized generic will work just as well as the branded drug, but it doesn't appear to be covered as widely by insurers. That may mean patients will have to obtain new prescriptions and sort out coverage hurdles at the height of respiratory virus season.\n\"This medication has been the most commonly used inhaled medication for the past 25 or 30 years,\" said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center. \"It's the one that, overwhelmingly, pediatricians reach for when they decide that their patient needs a daily preventive medication. ... The fact that it's being discontinued is going to be a huge shock to the system for patients, for families and for doctors.\"\nDoctors are urging patients to take action now to ensure they've got their medicine heading into the new year and advocacy groups have been trying to get the word out.\nBut the story of why Flovent is disappearing, and the lack of insurance coverage for its ostensibly identical replacement, touches on some of the most complex facets of American health care and drug pricing.\nA spokeswoman for GSK said the company is making the change \"as part of our commitment to be ambitious for patients.\"\nShe noted the company introduced the authorized generics of Flovent HFA, an inhalation aerosol, and Flovent Diskus, an inhalation powder, in May 2022 and October 2023, and that, subsequently, it would discontinue manufacturing the branded versions in the United States on January 1, 2024.\nThe authorized generics, she said, \"will provide patients in the US with potentially lower cost alternatives of these medically important products.\"\nExperts who follow the industry both on Wall Street and in academia, though, point out GSK is making the switch at precisely the time a change in Medicaid rebates could cause the company to have to pay large penalties because of price increases on Flovent over a number of years.\nThe legal change coming into effect on the first of the year removes a cap on Medicaid rebates that companies are required to pay if they raise the price of medicines more than inflation.\n\"Flovent Diskus has been on the market since 2000 and Flovent HFA since 2004, and GSK has hiked the price on both products numerous times since their launch,\" Dr. William Feldman, an associate physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies asthma drugs, told CNN. \"These are precisely the sort of drugs that will be affected by the new policy eliminating the Medicaid rebate cap.\"\nUntil now, the rebates were capped at the total price of a drug, so manufacturers would never pay more than a drug costs back to Medicaid.\nBut under a provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that limit was removed, and starting January 1, 2024, drugs that have been subject to large price increases over time could end up incurring rebates to Medicaid that are greater than their price - meaning pharmaceutical companies would sell those drugs to Medicaid at a loss.\n\"Obviously pharma doesn't want to be selling at a loss on anything in its portfolio,\" said Andrew Baum, an analyst who covers the stock of GSK and other pharmaceutical companies for the financial firm Citi. \"So it seeks to evade impact by, one: discontinuation; two: authorized generic.\"\nAn authorized generic, Baum told CNN, is viewed as a separate product, \"but still enables pharma to collect some of the economics.\"\nOr, put another way, it's the same product without the branding and also without the history of price increases that would leave the medicine vulnerable to such large rebates to Medicaid.\nAccording to data from GoodRx, the price of branded Flovent has gone up about 47% since 2014.\nOther drugmakers have made changes ahead of the January 1 rebate cap removal as well; makers of insulin this year announced major price cuts - of 70% or more - on their products, a move analysts estimate will save them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\nThe authorized generic strategy GSK is employing \"is a way, broadly speaking, to maximize the profitability of the product in question,\" said David Amsellem, a financial analyst who covers the industry at investment firm Piper Sandler.\nHe noted there are currently no other generic versions of Flovent approved by the FDA.\nGSK did price the authorized generic lower than branded Flovent; one package of Flovent HFA in the 110 microgram dose, for example, costs $273.83, about 50% more than the $177.99 wholesale acquisition cost of its authorized generic counterpart, according to prices the company shared with CNN. The wholesale acquisition cost is the price before insurance and rebates.\nBut CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager that determines which medicines are covered by insurance for its members, is giving preferential placement to another branded inhaler, Pulmicort, on its formulary, instead of the authorized generic versions of Flovent.\n\"In this case, the authorized generics were more expensive than the brand name medications,\" a CVS spokesman told CNN. He noted that's based on net prices, rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, meaning Pulmicort could be less expensive because of rebates its manufacturer, AstraZeneca, pays to obtain better insurance coverage.\nThe fact that insurance plans aren't broadly covering the authorized generic of Flovent, said BMC's Cohen, \"means that patients are going to need to get a brand new prescription for a completely different medication in the middle of the worst possible time of year, which is the winter respiratory virus season.\"\nFor patients with persistent asthma, Cohen said, Flovent has been the most commonly used daily preventive anti-inflammatory medication for decades. It shrinks swelling in the airways and reduces the body's exaggerated response to triggers that make it hard to breathe.\nDuring cold and flu season, she said, it becomes even more crucial to have that daily medicine.\n\"Flu, Covid, RSV - all these circulating viruses that are going around right now - are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, triggers for asthma attacks in kids,\" Cohen said. \"This is what leads to kids being in the emergency room.\"\nCohen said she's concerned that patients, as well as physicians and pharmacists, don't know this change with Flovent is coming, and they need to act now to work out alternatives and determine insurance coverage.\nFor some groups, the alternatives are more limited. For patients with a more rare inflammatory condition, called eosinophilic esophagitis, Flovent HFA is one of the most commonly prescribed topical steroids, and other medicines don't have as much data supporting their use in the condition, said Dr. Erin Syverson, an attending physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Boston Children's Hospital.\nAs EoE affects the esophagus, patients swallow the medicine instead of breathing it in, and it can tame the inflammation that can cause pain with swallowing or food getting stuck, requiring procedures to remove it. In kids, Syverson said, EoE can lead to recurrent vomiting, heartburn, belly aches, and trouble making progress starting solid foods, and Flovent can help keep the condition under control.\n\"With the discontinuation coming up, I worry it's going to just be one more hurdle for this patient population that already has very limited medications available to them,\" Syverson told CNN. \"I don't know what January is going to be like, but I'm worried.\"\nCNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

El Esequibo y la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana La acciÃ³n militar anunciada por Maduro supone el Ãºltimo episodio del litigio entre Venezuela y Guyana por la regiÃ³n del Esequibo, un territorio de unos 160.000 kilÃ³metros cuadrados, la mayorÃa de selva impenetrable que Caracas reclama como suyos desde que en 1899 un laudo internacional dictaminara que pertenecÃa a Reino Unido, entonces la potencia colonial que poseÃa lo que luego fue la Guyana independiente.\nEl contencioso se ha venido arrastrando con diferente intensidad desde entonces y se ha agravado en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os, despuÃ©s de que se descubrieran en la zona importantes yacimientos de crudo y gas , y el gobierno guyanÃ©s concediera licencias para su explotaciÃ³n a la energÃ©tica estadounidense ExxonMobil.\nEl asunto estÃ¡ en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, cuya autoridad sobre el caso Venezuela no reconoce.\nEl pasado 4 de diciembre el gobierno venezolano celebrÃ³ un referÃ©ndum en que la mayorÃa de votantes se mostraron a favor de incorporar el Esequibo como un nuevo estado de la RepÃºblica Bolivariana .\nEn un intento por rebajar la tensiÃ³n, Maduro se vio el 14 de diciembre con su homÃ³logo guyanÃ©s en un encuentro facilitado por la diplomacia brasileÃ±a y ambos acordaron rebajar la tensiÃ³n y descartaron el uso de la fuerza.\nPero la entrada en escena del gobierno britÃ¡nico y el envÃo de un buque militar a la zona ha provocado la reacciÃ³n de Venezuela\nCasi en simultÃ¡neo con la apariciÃ³n televisiva de Maduro, la CancillerÃa venezolana afirmÃ³ en un comunicado que Caracas se â€œreserva todas las acciones, en el marco de la ConstituciÃ³n y el derecho internacional, para defender su integridad marÃtima y territorial â€.\nEl patrullero HMS Trent, que Londres enviarÃ¡ al Caribe en medio de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana. PA El patrullero HMS Trent, que Londres enviarÃ¡ al Caribe en medio de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana. El buque britÃ¡nico El Ministerio de Defensa britÃ¡nico confirmÃ³ el pasado fin de semana que el buque HMS Trent participarÃ¡ en ejercicios conjuntos con Guyana despuÃ©s de la Navidad.\nGuyana, un miembro de la Mancomunidad BritÃ¡nica , es el Ãºnico paÃs de habla inglesa en SudamÃ©rica.\nEl HMS Trent cuenta con 65 tripulantes, una velocidad mÃ¡xima de 24 nudos y un alcance de 5.000 millas nÃ¡uticas.\nEl barco estÃ¡ armado con caÃ±ones de 30 mm y un contingente de cadetes de la Marina Real. TambiÃ©n puede desplegar helicÃ³pteros tipo Merlin y aeronaves no tripuladas.\nEl HMS Trent zarpÃ³ de su puerto base en Gibraltar a comienzos de diciembre y actualmente se encuentra atracado en Bridgetown, la capital de Barbados, durante la Navidad.\nSe anticipa que el barco de guerra eche ancla frente a la capital de Guyana, Georgetown, y realice visitas, actividades conjuntas y entrenamiento con la marina de ese paÃs y otros aliados . No puede atracar en el puerto por que este no es suficientemente profundo.\nEl ministro de Defensa de Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, se pronunciÃ³ el domingo sobre el anuncio a travÃ©s de la red social X (antes Twitter):\nâ€œÂ¿Un buque de guerra en aguas por delimitar? Â¿Y entonces? Â¿Y el compromiso con la buena vecindad y la convivencia pacÃfica? Â¿Y el acuerdo de no amenazarse y utilizar la fuerza mutuamente en ninguna circunstancia?\nÂ¡Seguimos alertas ante estas provocaciones que ponen en riesgo la paz y la estabilidad del Caribe y nuestra AmÃ©rica!â€, seÃ±alÃ³ el funcionario.\nBBC Recuerda que puedes recibir notificaciones de BBC News Mundo.

A pesar de las órdenes estrictas de las autoridades de evacuar la zona por los estragos que podía causar la llegada de Milton, el hombre hizo caso omiso y aseguró que allí se quedaba por un mensaje de Dios. Publicidad \"Dios me dijo que viniera aquí y tomara el bote\", aseguró el Teniente Dan. Sin ningún tipo de protección en su cuerpo, ni en el bote, el hombre se refugió allí indicando que se sentía seguro y permanecería en la bahía todo el tiempo. Publicidad \"El agua va a entrar y a subir. Si estás en tierra, te inundarás y corres el riesgo de ahogarte. Estoy en un bote, así que el bote sube con el agua. Realmente es el lugar más seguro para estar, en mi bote\", dijo Malinowski en un video que circula en redes sociales. El Teniente Dan indicó, en diálogo con NewsNation, que su actuar no refleja pensamientos suicidas ni tampoco está loco como algunas personas lo han sugerido en redes sociales al conocer su historia; es un hombre de fe y siguió la orden divina de Dios. \"Lo pongo en manos de Dios y lo saco de las mías y de las del hombre\", ratificó Malinowski. 🇺🇸 | En Florida, un hombre identificado como Joseph Malinowski se resiste a abandonar su velero en la Bahía de Tampa a pesar de la inminente llegada del huracán Milton. — Alerta Mundial (@AlertaMundoNews) Joseph afirma que recibió un mensaje divino: \"Dios me dijo que viniera aquí y tomara el bote\".

El bote en el que se resguardó sufrió algunas averías por Milton y los fuertes vientos que golpearon el sureste de Estados Unidos. Así lo confirmó un reportero que visitó el lugar en donde se quedó el hombre para verificar su estado de salud. Medios locales señalaron que el Teniente Dan se sentía un poco mareado por las olas que alcanzaron el navío, pero no presentaba lesiones de gravedad.
