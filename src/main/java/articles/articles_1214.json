    "text": "It wasn’t long ago that large groups of African asylum seekers could be seen routinely sleeping on the sidewalks outside the City of Toronto’s Streets To Homes assessment and referral centre on Peter Street. The large and sudden influx of migrants in need compounded the pressure on an already-overflowing shelter system. Thousands of those refugees were saved from the streets by volunteers at three Toronto-based churches, Revivaltime Tabernacle, Dominion Church International and Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles.They did what they could to serve hungry refugees, but as the months passed, the expenses became too great to bear for the amount of assistance they received.Revivaltime shut down its shelter operation in September, while Dominion sent its last batch of asylum seekers off to temporary spaces with the help of the federal government shortly before Christmas.Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle continues its effort but on a far smaller scale. Story continues below advertisement “Because no more funds [are] coming, we’re downsizing,” explained Executive Director Nadine Miller.Miller and volunteers have done 15-hour shifts, cooking for, cleaning, feeding and clothing an estimated 1,000-1,500 asylum seekers over the last six months, at times allowing hundreds of them to live inside the small church’s premises. That number is down to just over 30 residents now. Two white buses could be seen outside the church’s front door on Albion Road near Islington Avenue Thursday afternoon. The buses, chartered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada transported just over 50 migrants from Pilgrim Feast to hotels in Niagara Falls. In previous weeks they’ve taken others to temporary spaces in Windsor and Mississauga. Get the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. “The church was never meant to do this,’ said Miller, pointing out that they’ve managed to help care for refugees on a combination of dwindling donations and their own expenditures, which they have been told are not fully reimbursable by the city.“I’m not looking for a medal from the government of Canada, but what I am looking for is financial help … I need the government to decide they want to speak to us. They need our help. We need their help. Let’s work together.”Answering questions via email, City of Toronto spokesperson Russell Baker told Global News, “As of December 17, the City was supporting 11,181 people – 9,370 people in the shelter system and 1,811 people outside the shelter system in bridging hotels and programs supported by the Canadian Red Cross. Of these, 5,372 are refugee claimants – or 48 per cent of the total number of people being supported.” Story continues below advertisement Baker wrote that the City gave Revivaltime, Pilgrim Feast and Dominion $50,000 each in September to help with the costs of the refugee response. Later that month, city council included the latter two churches in a plan to divide $750,000 in funds among 22 eligible community organizations. Related News North Toronto churches sheltering refugees feeling strained Refugees moved out of Toronto churches and into hotels across Ontario “Dominion Church received $140,015 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $190,015,” wrote Baker.“Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles received $235,305 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $285,305.”City officials realize that is not enough to fund the churches’ efforts, but say City Hall itself isn’t getting enough from Ottawa.“In December, the City of Toronto received confirmation that $35 million will be paid to the City by the Federal government, which still leaves $165 million in required funding for the City to manage refugee claimant costs … the City continues to call on its federal partners for all remaining 2023 expenses by year-end.”With the arrival of winter, shelter systems around the GTA are full, and alternative programs are struggling. That leaves refugees like Rasidat, who says she came to Pilgrim Feast from Nigeria to flee persecution for her sexual orientation, worrying about the future.“We’re still looking for shelter,” she told Global News, pointing toward her children. Story continues below advertisement “If they don’t [increase funding] I will be outside. Something, I don’t know, might happen to my kids due to the cold outside.”Officials at both Pilgrim Feast and Dominion Church have discussed plans to raise funds for, buy and re-zone property to open up their own shelters for asylum claimants. Pilgrim Feast is hoping to open a space in Toronto, while Dominion is eyeing a spot in Peterborough. Those plans, however, are still in their early stages. &copy 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

    "text": "EAGLE PASS, TX — With tension still growing in the ongoing standoff between the state of Texas and the federal government, word broke today that both sides had agreed to settle the conflict by having President Joe Biden and Governor Greg Abbott face off in a wheelchair joust to the death.\nIn the latest attempt to avoid full-scale hostilities, the two sides chose to follow the age-old tradition of having each side choose a hero to compete in winner-take-all one-on-one combat.\n\"Wheelchairs! At dawn!\" Governor Abbott was heard shouting after a tense phone call with President Biden. \"We will settle this in the old way. You and me. The victor shall rule the border. When you hear the sound of my wheels drawing near, you will know it is the sound of your impending doom.\"\nThe White House confirmed reports that the duel would take place. \"The president is ready,\" said history-making black and gay Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is black and gay. \"Though he is still mostly capable of walking, from a mental standpoint, he has been ready to use a wheelchair for several years. We are confident in his victory.\"\nHistorians reported that the ancient practice of wheelchair jousts to the death dates back to the Bronze Age, with Nebuchadnezzar II meeting Pharaoh Necho II on the battlefield of Carchemish. \"This was the standard means of settling conflicts for many centuries,\" one researcher said. \"It's exciting to see it brought back to prominence.\"\nAt publishing time, the White House refused to comment on rumors that the duel would be delayed due to President Biden's inability to learn how to use a wheelchair.\nThe Babylon Bee has been known to accurately predict the future.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more tactical instruction",

    "text": "Amazon flooded with fake 9800X3D listings for $199: don’t fall for it\nBeware of scam listings on Amazon this Black Friday\nWePC is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Prices subject to change. [Learn more](/earnings-disclaimer/)\nWith the 9800X3D’s blazing success, Amazon has experienced a mass flood of fake listings in the run-up to Black Friday. This is a particularly volatile time of year, especially for those who want the best deals. It’s easy for someone not as well-versed in standard prices to be tripped up by these fake listings.\nThese 9800X3D listings seem botted, as the descriptions read some whacky specifications, such as LGA 995 and 8 32nds cache. One thing is for sure: these are not the official listings for the processor. Multiple descriptions will likely differentiate each listing from Amazon, which usually only allows one product page per product. This is a way around that.\nThe seller for all these listings alternates between Lingmengj and Huangwenjie12334, which, if you haven’t guessed yet, isn’t AMD. It’s best to only buy products through trusted sellers or the manufacturer, where possible.\nThe 9800X3D is probably the hottest CPU we have ever seen, boasting some of the best gaming performance, so it’s easy to jump at the chance to pick one up for $200. But not so fast.\nHere’s an example of an obviously faked or botted description; another way (if you’re into computers), you can tell that the listings are fake. Sometimes Amazon information isn’t that accurate, but it at least doesn’t straight to make things up.\nWhere is the real 9800X3D listing?\nThis is the real listing and ASIN for the real 9800X3D listing. Although the product is currently out of stock, it is sold by AMD and has the correct product information in its description. You need to be really careful, particularly on Amazon, of scam listings, particularly around Black Friday, when “too-good-to-be-true” prices are somewhat acceptable during this huge sales period.\nFinal Word\nBlack Friday is probably one of the biggest sales events of the year, so there’s likely to be one or two scams floating around. The best thing to do is to check if the seller is legitimate and buy with a credit card or PayPal, which provides an extra layer of protection against scams. Of course, the best protection is prevention, so a keen eye will save you from a lot of potential hassle.",

Kakar said Pakistan was making all the necessary efforts to highlight the plight of the Palestinians on various global forums and would continue to do so in future. Pakistan caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar imposed a ban on New Year celebrations in the country in a bid to express solidarity with the people of Gaza amid the ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Kakar called on the people of his country to show solidarity with the Palestinians and display solemnity and humility on New Year. \"Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,\" he said in a brief address. trending now He further said that Israeli forces \"crossed all limits of violence and injustice\" by claiming the lives of over 21,000 Palestinians and killing nearly 9,000 children in its counter-offensive. \"The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\" He added that his country had sent two aid packages to Palestine with the third one being prepared. He also said that Pakistan was in talks with Jordan and Egypt to ensure timely aid to Palestinians and evacuation of wounded in Gaza. Kakar said Pakistan was making all necessary efforts to highlight the plight of the Palestinians on various global forums and would continue to do so in future.

A report released on Thursday (Dec 28) by the UN demanded an immediate end to the use of military weapons during law enforcement operations as well as an end to arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians, and the lifting of discriminatory movement restrictions. \"The use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,\" UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. \"The intensity of the violence and repression is something that has not been seen in years.\" The report looked at the human rights situation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7.
