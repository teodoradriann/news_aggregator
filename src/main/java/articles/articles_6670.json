    "text": "Every snowflake that falls from the sky seems magical, ready to transform our landscapes into a fairytale canvas. But these delicate crystals are also the source of many logistical challenges that can complicate people's daily lives. Snowfall can have a limiting, even dangerous impact, even more so when the winds are raging, visibility is reduced and you are unable to move.\nSnowy roads make driving difficult In winter, snow and road driving don't mix. This is because snowfall creates unfavorable driving conditions and drivers must be extra vigilant to ensure everyone's safety.\nDecreased visibility and slippery ground\nThe combination of suspended snow and snow that has fallen to the ground significantly reduces visibility on the road. In addition to the lack of clarity, the snowy ground is slippery. The alternation between snow that melts during the day and freezes at night creates icy patches that further increase the risk of slipping.\nSlowed down road traffic\nThe longer the snowfall continues, the more obstacles there will be on the roads. The accumulation of snowdrifts and other snow piles makes driving difficult and dangerous. As a result, snow-covered roads may be subject to temporary closures or detours, in particular so that professionals can carry out snow removal operations.\nIf the snow-covered roads remain open despite the weather conditions, traffic will be severely disrupted and slowed down. Speed limits, traffic restrictions, accidents and traffic jams are sure to be there.\nMechanical damage to vehicles\nIn addition, snowfall also causes mechanical damage to vehicles. This is because snow seeps in and very low temperatures affect their proper functioning on several levels: batteries weaken, tires deflate, brakes get damaged and coolants freeze.\nIncreased risk of accidents\nFor all these reasons, snowfall and snow-covered roads significantly increase the risk of road accidents. The road authorities are in charge of snow removal and the good condition of the roads. However, these operations are complicated when snow falls unpredictably.\nDriving safely To minimize the danger, it is necessary to adopt careful driving. First, by reducing speed, anticipating stops, avoiding sudden movements, maintaining safety distances and using lights. You can turn on the low beam headlights even during the day to improve visibility or the fog lights.\nTo improve grip on snow and ice, winter tires or chains are highly recommended. Tires should always be in good condition and properly inflated.\nFinally, each vehicle must be equipped with a winter emergency kit. This can contain blankets, warm clothes, food supplies, a shovel, jumper cables, etc.\nPublic transport disrupted Snowfall also impacts public transport, in a variable way depending on the type of vehicle.\nBuses\nBuses face the same challenges as cars in snow: lack of visibility, difficult driving, increased risk of slipping, and mechanical problems. While waiting for more favourable weather conditions and snow removal operations, roads may close. If the lanes remain accessible, traffic disruptions are to be feared with traffic blockages and also accidents.\nTrains\nUnderground trains such as subways are less affected, as they are not directly exposed to snowfall and run on fixed rails.\nLong-distance outer trains are minimally impacted, as they run on fixed railway tracks that provide good grip and reduce the risk of skidding. Railways are often better maintained than roads with de-icing and snow removal devices managed by railway companies. Unlike roads where snow can accumulate, railway tracks are designed to minimize snow accumulations. In addition, trains can crush snow on the tracks as they pass. Finally, they are heavier and therefore more stable transports, unlike smaller vehicles which are more likely to slip, because they are lighter.\nAirplanes\nThe plane moves between heaven and earth. In order to avoid skidding, runways must be completely de-iced and clear for safe take-off and landing. However, snow can accumulate on aircraft surfaces, such as wings or control surfaces, and affect lift, stability, and aerodynamics.\nIn addition to regular inspections, aircraft are subject to other special checks in the winter. Pilots must follow specific procedures in case of snowfall and complicated weather conditions. For obvious safety reasons, flights may be cancelled.\nDaily life turned upside down Since roads are difficult to navigate and to prevent accidents, schools and businesses may close. Deliveries of goods and supplies are also slowed down or stopped. Daily life can be disrupted by electricity, gas, heating and water cuts.\nFinally, snowfall also impacts pedestrians. Indeed, walking on snowy and/or icy sidewalks is a delicate exercise with risks of falls and injuries.\nIncreased avalanche risk In addition to the impact of snowfall on transport, roads and people's daily lives, the risk of avalanches on people and infrastructure cannot be excluded.\nWind Plate Formation\nAn avalanche is formed when snow accumulates on a slope. The fresh snow adds to an already existing layer and increases the weight on the slope, producing the avalanche. In the mountains, the direction of the wind can deposit snow on the windy side of a ridge or ledge, forming wind slabs.\nThese plates are unstable and easily detached. Just an extra weight can cause the slab to break down and trigger an avalanche. When a slab of wind breaks off, it can quickly spread down the slope, taking the surrounding snow with it. This rapid spread can increase the size and power of the avalanche.\nRisks to human life and the economy\nThe risks to the population are therefore real since avalanches can cause loss of life. People caught in an avalanche can be injured or, in the worst case, die.\nSnow avalanches can damage or destroy everything in their path: entire lots, roads, bridges, buildings, vegetation, etc. This results in significant financial damage to homeowners and utilities. Rebuilding infrastructure after an avalanche can be time-consuming and costly. Not to mention that there are often impacts on economic activities such as tourism or agriculture.\nRead also\"An avalanche can bury a person like a village\": a rescuer recounts his missions\nAccess to some populated areas may be blocked, isolating populations and making it difficult to deliver emergency aid, medical supplies and other relief. Apart from the material aspect, psychological sequelae are sometimes observed after such meteorological phenomena.\nFaced with the seriousness of the consequences of snowfall or avalanches, preventive measures are essential. Early warning systems, contingency plans, weather monitoring and public awareness are essential elements to best manage extreme situations and try to minimize the damage.",

    "text": "Last weekend, Jump Festa 2025 was held, an event where some of the great news for the anime industry was announced. If you are a fan of Shonen Jump works, then we share with you all the most important details of this event.\nJujutsu Kaisen Fans of Gege Akutami’s work have much to celebrate. Although at the moment there is no release date, a new art of the third season of the Jujutsu Kaisen anime was shared. Likewise, it was confirmed that Hidden Inventory/Premature Death, a film that recapitulates the first five episodes of the second season of the anime, will hit theaters in Japan on May 30, 2025. Finally, it was confirmed that the Jujutsu manga Kaisen will have a 16-page epilogue that will be available alongside the last volume.\nDemon Slayer Despite everything that is on the way for Demon Slayer, at Jump Festa 2025 we saw Natsuki Hanae, Hiro Shimono and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who confirmed that the Swordsmith Village arc will have a theatrical adaptation, although at the moment there are no more details about this production .\nSakamoto Days Sakamoto Days, one of the most anticipated anime for 2025, revealed a new trailer, with the closing theme Fuutsu by Conton Candy. Likewise, the additional cast was confirmed to include Hiroki Yasumoto as Hyo, Hochu Otsuka as Takamura, and Daisuke Namikawa as X/Slur.\nSpy x Family During Jump Festa 2025 we had the opportunity to see Special Mission 5, a special retrospective of the last years of the manga. Along with this, it was confirmed that the third season of the anime will be available sometime next October 2025, so it will be some time before we have the opportunity to have more information about the expected return of the Forger family. .\nTaste After a fantastic first impression with the first season, Science Saru confirmed that the second season will arrive in July 2025, and the cast reunited to review highlights from the first season. Along with this, a trailer was shared of what awaits us in Dandadan.\nMy Hero Academia After hundreds of rumors, during Jump Festa 2025 it was finally confirmed that the spin-off manga of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes will have an anime adaptation, although at the moment there is no release date for this series. Likewise, the eighth, and final, season of My Hero Academia will be available in the fall of 2025 for season 8.\nChainsaw Man After years without new information, MAPPA confirmed that Chainsaw Man: The Reze Arc will hit theaters sometime in 2025. The film will continue the events of the anime, and while there is a change of direction, fans are happy that this beloved arc finally has an adaptation.\nOne Piece As expected, the new voice actor for Franky in Japanese was revealed at the Super Stage. Kazuki Yao passed the baton to his colleague, Subaru Kimura. Likewise, a special illustration was shared confirming that the One Piece anime will return in April 2025, after a long wait.\nThese were the most important announcements of Jump Festa 2025, but not the only ones, since multiple productions confirmed new seasons, revealed more illustrations, and some of the plans for Shonen Jump adaptations for next year were announced. On related topics, this is the date for the third season of One Punch Man. Likewise, Dragon Ball Daima will hit theaters in Mexico with dubbing.\nAuthor’s Note:\nOf all the announcements, my favorite was the one for Chainsaw Man. After a couple of years of silence, it’s good to see that MAPPA is doing everything it can to make the adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work a success, even when it seems that it is not.\nVia: Anime Corner",

    "title": "Marineland ordered to pay $85k after 3 bears kept in cramped quarters for months",
    "text": "TORONTO - Marineland has been ordered to pay nearly $85,000 in fines and restitution after it was found guilty under Ontario’s animal cruelty laws of three charges related to its care of three black bears. The amount, which was jointly proposed by lawyers for the Crown and Marineland, includes a $15,000 fine for each of the bears, a 25-per-cent victim surcharge and $28,000 in restitution for the care of the bears after they were seized by animal welfare officers. The Niagara, Ont., tourist attraction was found guilty in March in what’s believed to be its first conviction under animal-cruelty laws. An agreed statement of facts read in court earlier this year said the bears – Slash, Toad and Lizzy – lived in small enclosures with inadequate access to water for months. It said the enclosures measured 48 square feet, with the two females, Toad and Lizzy, sharing one. The statement said animal welfare inspectors visited Marineland in early June 2021 and soon issued orders to the park, including that the bears have enclosures of at least 5,000 square feet if alone and access to water sources. Not enough progress had been made on the enclosures months later, court heard Thursday in an updated statement, and Animal Welfare Services eventually removed all three bears from the park’s care. A lawyer representing Marineland told the court Thursday the orders were issued during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was difficult to find staff to do the carpentry work required to improve the enclosures, but that efforts were underway at the time the bears were removed. Michelle Psutka added the sentence represents a “significant” fine. “This is a first-time offence for Marineland, and again we are dealing with a fail-to-comply case, not a case of a finding of animal cruelty,” she said in her submissions. Marineland has until late September to pay the restitution fee, which the Crown said is based on costs of $145 a day to care for two of the bears over roughly six months before they were brought to a permanent enclosure at a wildlife facility. The justice of the peace overseeing the case said she was satisfied the jointly proposed sentence addressed the need for deterrence as well as any aggravating and mitigating factors. Animal Justice, an animal law advocacy organization, expressed disappointment that prosecutors didn’t seek an order prohibiting Marineland from having other animals, and that no ongoing remedial measures were imposed. However, the organization — which unsuccessfully sought to participate in the sentencing as an intervener — hailed the ruling as historic as it marks the first time the roadside zoo and aquarium has faced legal consequences for animal welfare offences. “Today marks a watershed moment in the fight to protect vulnerable animals from being abused for entertainment,” Camille Labchuk, the organization’s executive direction, said in a statement. The province has been investigating the park for four years. One killer whale, 14 beluga whales and one dolphin have died at the park since 2019. Currently, 15 bears remain at Marineland. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.",

    "text": "California wildfires closed Washoe schools 11 times in 2020. Could this year be a repeat? Siobhan McAndrew Reno Gazette Journal If history repeats itself, the first day of school in Washoe County could be called for smoke.\nSmoke from California's Park Fire is blowing into Northern Nevada with just over a week until school starts. The Air Quality Index has hovered in the yellow and orange zones, meaning it is unhealthy for sensitive groups of people.\nThat's just below where it was in 2020, when heavy smoke from the Loyalton Fire burning in Plumas, Sierra and Lassen counties poured into the Truckee Meadows, cancelling the first day of school. School would close 10 more times in August and September due to dangerous conditions from the smoke.\nThe Park Fire that started near Chico, California, had already burned nearly 400,000 acres , scorched hundreds of structures and stood at less than 20% containment as of Thursday afternoon.\nIf the fire is still burning on Aug. 12, the first day of school in Washoe County, and winds are driving the smoke into the Truckee Meadows, could there be a repeat of 2020?\nHere's what would have to happen:\nWhat we know How is a smoke day decided? The Washoe County School District has set up a policy to monitor the air quality. If multiple readings show that the air quality index is above 301, meaning it is hazardous for all, and is expected to remain that way, classes would be canceled.\nAQI readings\n0–50: Good air quality with little to no risk 51–100: Moderate air quality 101–150: Unhealthy for sensitive groups 151–200: Unhealthy air quality 201–300: Very unhealthy air quality 301+: Hazardous air quality\nHas anything chanced since 2020? The district closed its buildings 11 days because of smoke in 2020, but the threshold to trigger a smoke day is much higher now. In 2020, classes were canceled if the AQI was above 150. It’s now triggered at 301.\nProcedure: Just like a snow day, district leaders start talking the night before and early the day of expected smoky skies, consulting health experts and the National Weather Service. The final decision will be made by Superintendent Joe Ernst. The message will be relayed to families just as it is with snow days, with early calls, texts and emails.\nDays have to be made up: Smoke days and snow days will have to be made up at the end of the year. The district has built in three contingency days at the end of the school year. Even one smoke or snow day triggers those days. Instead of the school year ending on June 6 it could be extended to June 9, 10 or 11.\nInside schools: While air quality decisions are made factoring in exposure people face traveling to and from school, every building has commercial-grade HVAC systems. Buildings are fitted with windows and doors that limit smoke intrusion and balance indoor and outdoor air. Air is filter inside every building through filters multiple times per hour.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "МОСКВА, 14 авг — РИА Новости. Национальный мессенджер Max в июле заблокировал десять тысяч номеров мошенников, сообщили в компании. Подпишитесь на канал РИА Новости>>> \"В июле текущего года заблокировано более десяти тысяч телефонных номеров мошенников, которые чаще всего предпринимали попытки выдать себя за сотрудников банков, правоохранительных органов или государственных сервисов. Удалено более 32 тысяч вредоносных и спам-документов до нанесения ущерба пользователям\", — говорится в релизе. Аккаунты, которые уличили в мошеннических действий на платформе, блокируют пожизненно, а информацию передают в Минцифры. Специалисты центра безопасности мессенджера используют автоматизированные технические системы и отслеживают обращения пользователей в круглосуточном режиме. \"Мах считает безусловным приоритетом безопасность пользователей, активно привлекает к сотрудничеству партнеров из числа лидирующих компаний в направлении кибербезопасности в России и намерен предпринимать решительные меры по борьбе с недобросовестным поведением на платформе\", — отметили в компании. В марте VK запустил бета-версию MAX, через которую можно общаться, звонить, отправлять голосовые сообщения и файлы до четырех гигабайт. Цифровая платформа доступна в App Store, RuStore и Google Play. Официальный запуск мессенджера запланирован на начало осени. Пользователи уже могут: подписаться на каналы; ставить реакции; настраивать уведомления; закреплять каналы в списке чатов и объединять их в папки. В ближайшее время в мессенджере появится возможность подключаться к порталу \"Госуслуги\". Его оснастят системой цифрового идентификатора, который позволит подтверждать личность без использования бумажных документов. Также планируется внедрить функцию электронной подписи и образовательные сервисы.​",

    "text": "Romualdez nagbabala na ilalantad mga establismento lumalabag sa senior discount policy Binalaan ni House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez ang mga establismento na hindi magbibigay ng nararapat na diskuwento sa senior citizens. Ayon kay Romualdez kikilalanin niya sa publiko ang mga negosyo na nagmemenos sa mga nasa edad 60 pataas, gayundin sa mga may kapansanan at solo parent. “We have granted these privileges to our people, and we will see to it that those covered receive them. Entities that are not granting the discounts and other benefits will be exposed and compelled to comply with the laws. We will also not hesitate to initiate prosecution,” ani Romualdez. Hinikayat niya ang lahat ng mga establismento na bigyan ng 20 porsiyentong diskuwento ang senior citizens at persons wth disability (PWDs). Noong nakaraang Martes, tatlong komite ng Kamara ang nagsama-sama sa pagdinig ukol sa mga reklamo nang hindi tamang diskuwento sa SCs at PWDs.
