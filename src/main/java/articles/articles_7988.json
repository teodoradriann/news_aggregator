    "text": "2024 was the hottest year on record, breaching a critical climate goal and capping 10 years of unprecedented heat Laura Paddison, CNN Fri, January 10, 2025 at 3:00 AM UTC 3 min read\nIt’s official: 2024 was the hottest year on record, breaking the previous record set in 2023 and pushing the world over a critical climate threshold, according to new data from Europe’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus.\nLast year was 1.6 degrees hotter than the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels, Copernicus found. It makes 2024 the first calendar year to breach the 1.5-degree limit countries agreed to avoid under the Paris climate agreement in 2015.\nScientists are much more concerned about breaches over decades, rather than single years — as above that threshold humans and ecosystems may struggle to adapt — but 2024’s record “does mean we’re getting dangerously close,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Copernicus analysis points to a slew of climate records falling last year: The planet endured its hottest day on record in July; each month from January to June was the warmest such month on record; and levels of planet-heating pollution reached unprecedented highs.\nLast year is part of a pattern of off-the-charts heat. Every single one of the world’s 10 hottest years happened in the last decade, according to Copernicus data.\nBehind these statistics lies a huge toll. “Every fraction of a degree … brings more harm to people and ecosystems,” Rogelj said.\nThe extreme weather that swept the globe last year shows just how dangerous life in a warmer world already is.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Back-to-back hurricanes in the US, fueled by ultra-warm ocean temperatures , killed hundreds of people. In Spain, more than 200 people died in catastrophic floods . Amazon rivers fell to unprecedented lows during the region’s worst drought on record and the Philippines experienced an extraordinary typhoon season, with six in just 30 days.\nThe climate crisis played a role in all of these extreme events, according to scientific analyses.\nA local police car engulfed in mud in a flooded area of Lake Lure, North Carolina, October 2, 2024, in the wake of Hurricane Helene. - Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\nLow water levels in the Amazon River in the Macedonia community of Colombia on October 2, 2024. - Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images Scientists are still trying to fully understand why global heat has been so extreme for the past two years.\nThe main driver is clear: the human-caused climate crisis, boosted by El Niño, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a warming influence, which began in 2023 and ended earlier this year. But it doesn’t explain all of the heat.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in World Showdown erupts at UN conference as Saudi Arabia and Russia call for measures to be watered down: 'This is unacceptable' The Cool Down Ukraine said one of its F-16 pilots achieved a feat nobody flying the jet has managed before Business Insider Army Wants To Test Air-Launched Drones From A Global Express Business Jet THE WARZONE A Boeing Jet's Nose Was Caught on Video Suddenly Collapsing to the Ground Futurism Scientists have also pointed to a recent drop in shipping pollution following regulations — a win for human health, but, in a cruel twist, this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space.\nThe eruption of a huge underwater volcano in the South Pacific in 2022, which sent plumes of water vapor — a potent greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere may have also contributed.\nThen there are the clouds. A December study found a dearth of sun-reflecting clouds over the ocean may be another factor.\nScientists believe it’s unlikely 2025 will be another record-breaking year. La Niña , a natural climate pattern that tends to have a global cooling influence, was declared Thursday.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “But people shouldn’t think that’s climate change hitting pause or plateauing,” said Paulo Ceppi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “A small dip doesn’t change the clear upward trajectory we’re on,” he added.\nScientists say the decades to come are likely to be hotter still as humans continue to burn planet-heating coal, oil and gas.\n“The world doesn’t need to come up with a magical solution to stop things from getting worse in 2025,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. ‘We know exactly what we need to do to transition away from fossil fuels.”\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 28,763 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "It was a dark time for the Jewish People. From their height of glory in the mid-first century, with three million Jews in Judea (the Land of Israel) and millions more throughout the world, with Jewish life and Torah institutions flourishing throughout the country, with the large and magnificent Jewish Temple standing in Jerusalem attracting pilgrimage, tourism, and trade from three continents, things were taking a turn for the worse.\nWithin less than a century, a series of Roman-Jewish precipitated the collapse of the Jewish Temple, the wholesale destruction of Jerusalem, and the slaughter of more than 60% of Judea’s Jewish population. Some of the greatest Jewish sages of all time were executed by the Romans during this period including Rabbi Akiva, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel (leader of the Sanhedrin), and Rabbi Ishmael (Israel’s last high priest). Fifty Jewish cities and 985 Jewish villages were razed to the ground. The Romans even salted the earth in the Judean hill country to ensure that Jewish agriculture and settlement could not continue in those areas.\nHundreds of thousands of Jews were sold as slaves throughout the Roman Empire or fled the country as refugees. There were only a few hundred thousand Jews left in the Land of Israel, mostly concentrated in the northern region of Galilee. Aside from the Holocaust, this was the most tragic period of Jewish history.\nIn the aftermath of the Bar Kochva Revolt , which was the last of the Roman-Jewish wars, Emperor Hadrian convened a closed cabinet meeting in order to prevent further uprisings and rebellions in Judea. Hadrian’s advisors concluded that the Jewish religion is inherently violent and the religious attachment of Judaism to a specific land or country will mean further trouble down the road. So the committee recommended changing the name of the land from Judea, which means “Land of the Jews”, to Palestina (later to be called Palestine in English), which is a Latin derivative of Philistia, “Land of the Philistines”.\nThe Philistines were Israel’s arch enemies in the days of the judges and in the early monarchic period (12 th -10 th centuries B.C.E.), but they had ceased to exist as a distinct ethnic group some 700 years before the Bar Kochva Revolt. Judea ceased to be an independent Roman province and instead merged with Roman occupied Syria to the north. The whole area of what is today Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and the Palestinian territories became a singular province called Syria-Palestina within the larger Roman Empire.\nBecause of the religious importance of Jerusalem to the Jewish People, the name of the holy city was changed to Aelia Capitalina (Aelia being Hadrian’s middle name and Capitalina meaning, “the greatest”). Changing the Jewish names to Roman ones would punish the Jews for their destructive rebellions, detach the land from its inherent Jewish identity and character, and help foster assimilation and the disappearance of the Jews within the Roman Empire.\nHadrian\nThe city was rebuilt and repopulated by Roman pagan citizens while a temple to Jupiter (the most revered Roman deity) was constructed over the ruins of the Jewish Temple.\nIn addition to changing the names of Judea and Jerusalem , Hadrian’s committee also recommended a program of prohibiting the practice of Judaism and encouraged the Jewish population to adopt Roman cultural practices and pagan religious norms. The Jewish calendar was banned, which made it impossible to know which days to celebrate the festivals. Circumcision and Sabbath observance were prohibited, synagogues were replaced by Roman temples, Jewish ritual baths were closed, Torah scrolls were publicly burned, teaching Judaism became illegal, and rabbinical ordination was absolutely forbidden.\nRabbinical ordination known as “ semicha ” was the traditional Israelite method of passing Jewish leadership from one generation to the next. The term “ s emicha , ” ordination, literally means “ support ” and comes from the verse that describes Moses appointing Joshua as his successor by leaning his hands on his head. The Book of Numbers it says that Moses “laid [ vayismoch in Hebrew] his hands upon him [Joshua]” and in doing so, passed over the spiritual and political leadership of the Children of Israel. Traditionally, the same method was done from Joshua to all the leaders of Israel throughout history until the Roman period in an unbroken chain, from teacher to student. By eliminating rabbinical ordination, their hope was for Jewish leadership to die out in the second century.\nJews were also forbidden from settling in Jerusalem or even visiting the holy city except on Tisha B’Av, the day commemorating the Temple’s destruction by the Romans. Any Jewish person who was caught in violation of any of these restrictions could be tortured and executed.\nThree years later Hadrian died and most of the above-mentioned were rescinded by the new Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius who was more sympathetic to the Jews. The restrictions against Jews entering Jerusalem continued for another 500 years until the Arabs conquered the region in the 7 th century.\nThis was not the first time in history that anti-Jewish laws were being enforced. They were implemented by several idolatrous Jewish kings during the Biblical period, they were enforced by the Greeks during the reign of Antiochus (preceding the Hanukkah story), and now again in the time of Hadrian. Although challenging, Jews always found ways to observe the laws of the Torah in secret during periods of religious persecution.\nWhat was uniquely different about the Roman persecution and most dangerous for the continued survival of the Jewish Nation was the prohibition against semicha (rabbinical ordination).\nIn those days the Jewish calendar was not fixed as it is today. The beginning of the new month (Rosh Chodesh) was determined by witnesses reporting to the Sanhedrin (the central religious authority in the Jewish world). The declaration would be transmitted throughout the Land of Israel and to all the lands of the Jewish Diaspora through a chain of beacon fires lit on mountaintops across vast distances and through messengers on horseback. The Jewish calendar, however, was never exclusively a lunar calendar. If that were so, the various Jewish months and holidays would fall at different times of the year as is the case with the Islamic calendar. The Torah, however, stipulates that the month of Nissan in which we celebrate Passover must fall out in the springtime, which necessitated the creation of a leap year. On a Jewish leap year, an extra month is added every few years ensuring Passover always falls out in the spring.\nThe Sanhedrin , from an 1883 encyclopedia\nBut the catch is that only someone with rabbinical ordination in the Land of Israel is permitted to declare a leap year. If the Romans succeeded in eliminating the last of the rabbis, declaring a leap year would no longer be possible and the Jewish calendar would have essentially become null and void. Without the Jewish calendar functioning properly, it would be impossible to observe the festivals in their proper times and Judaism as we know it would cease to exist.\nIn the aftermath of the Bar Kochva Revolt, there were only two Jews alive in Israel with rabbinical ordination. One of them was Rabbi Akiva, but since he offered political support to Bar Kochva (who led a major rebellion against Rome) and continued teaching Torah in violation of Roman law, he was arrested, tortured, and executed in 135 CE. After that, there was only one man left with rabbinical ordination and that was Judah ben Bava.\nHadrian, Roman coin\nJudah ben Bava was one of the few elders alive at the time who had firsthand memories of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem that was destroyed some seven decades earlier during his youth. He was one of the great scholars involved in preserving Jewish traditions, customs, and laws in the post-Temple era. Judah was considered a righteous and pious individual and a respected member of the Sanhedrin .\nGiven the magnitude of Jewish civilian casualties (including rabbis), there were very few scholars left in the land. Despite the danger and against all odds, Judah ben Bava gathered together the most gifted students of Torah in order to pass on semicha (rabbinical ordination) to the next generation in defiance of Hadrian’s law. Emperor Hadrian stipulated not only would the rabbi who gives rabbinical ordination be executed, but also the student who receives it, and the town or village in which this event takes place (or the closest town to it) would be utterly destroyed.\nBy this point, the Romans had already destroyed dozens of Jewish cities and villages, so this was no bluff. In order to spare the suffering of other Jews, Judah brought his students to a narrow mountain pass in a rural area equidistant between two cities, Usha and Shefaram (both former and future locations of the Sanhedrin located some 12 miles east of Haifa). The logic would be that if discovered, both cities would be equally out of reach and therefore spared from any harm.\nOne by one, Rabbi Judah ben Bava placed his hands on the heads of five or six young Jewish scholars. Rabbi Meir who was previously a student of Rabbi Akiva was present along with Rabbi Judah Bar Ilai, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, Rabbi Yossi ben Halafta, Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, and possibly also Rabbi Nechemia. As soon as the last student was ordained, sounds of Roman soldiers could be heard, yelling, and charging towards them on horseback. They’ve been caught!\nPanic struck the students. In the face of imminent danger, Rabbi Judah ben Bava called out to his students, “My sons, run!”\nThey responded, “Our teacher, but what will become of you?”\nThe rabbi replied, “I am placed before my enemies like a rock that cannot be turned.”\nJudah understood that in his old age, he would not get very far and he would only slow down his students who he just ordained, putting their lives at risk along with the entirety of Judaism. The mountain passage that he was standing in front of was so small that the students could only flee in a single file line.\nThe Tomb of Judah ben Bava\nAfter the students fled, Judah held out for quite some time, preventing the soldiers from advancing. According to legend, an order was given and 300 iron spears were thrust into his body, but by the time they were able to budge his lifeless corpse, the students had already spread out and ran a considerable distance. They escaped Roman-occupied Judea and temporarily resettled in Babylonia that was outside the sphere of Roman influence. It also boasted a large Jewish population and was considered a center of Torah scholarship.\nHadrian died in 138 CE. Once the anti-Jewish laws were rescinded and the dust settled, the students of Rabbi Judah ben Bava returned to Judea (now renamed Palestina) in 142 CE. Their goal was to rebuild the disseminated Jewish community of Israel and they went on to accomplish great things there. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai taught the secret mystical dimension of Torah known as Kabbalah , which became the chief work of Jewish mysticism called the Zohar. Rabbi Yossi ben Halafta went on to compose the first comprehensive chronology of Jewish history beginning from Adam until his time period (the 2 nd century). Despite the various accomplishments of Judah’s students, the greatest victory, of course, was the continuity of rabbinical ordination and the preservation of the Jewish calendar.\nWith the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the fourth century, Jewish national institutions in the Land of Israel, like the Sanhedrin, started to come under scrutiny. Its abolishment or other potential restrictions might once again threaten the Jewish calendar as it did in the days of Judah ben Bava. Hillel II, president of the Sanhedrin during the 4 th century, made the difficult decision to fix the Jewish calendar (therefore ending the need to declare leap years). The benefit would be that any future imperial restrictions against Jewish observance, rabbinical ordination, or the functioning of the Sanhedrin would not affect the Jewish calendar and the continuity of Jewish holidays occurring in their proper times. The disadvantage was that it would end the Diaspora’s dependence on the Land of Israel as a central religious authority and thus sever the link between Israel’s dwindling Jewish population and Diaspora communities around the world.\nIn retrospect, this decision was bound to be made at some point since Jewish communities were migrating further apart and the ability of messengers to reach their destinations on time was becoming impractical.\nThe self-sacrifice of Judah ben Bava allowed rabbinical ordination to continue for another few centuries, just in time for Hillel II to make the local Jewish calendar go global. Only 40 years after Hillel II passed away, the Romans did in fact permanently abolish the Sanhedrin (making declarations of new months and leap years illegal), but by this time, the fixed calendar had already circulated to the various Diaspora communities that existed at that time in the Middle East, North Africa, and southern Europe. Judaism was saved by a hair’s breath and we can celebrate our festivals today due to the dedication and bravery of Judah ben Bava.",

    "title": "Pope Francis To Miss Holy Year Events Amid Hospitalisation For 'Complex' Respiratory Infection",
    "text": "Pope Francis will not participate in this weekend’s Holy Year events as he remains in hospital for a “complex” respiratory infection, the Vatican announced on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling the illness for over a week and was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on February 14.\nThe Vatican confirmed that all public events on the pope’s schedule have been cancelled through Sunday. However, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni reassured the public that Francis had slept peacefully overnight and eaten breakfast on Tuesday. A further update on his condition is expected later in the day.\nA Vatican official, speaking anonymously, clarified that the pope is not on a ventilator and is breathing on his own.\nPope Francis had been scheduled to lead several events for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, which extends through to next January. The Holy Year is a significant period for Catholics, marked by themes of pardon and forgiveness. The Vatican anticipates that 32 million pilgrims will visit Rome throughout the year, with many looking forward to special audiences with the pontiff.\nThe Vatican revealed on Monday that doctors had altered the pope’s drug therapy for the second time during his hospitalisation, describing his condition as a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.” This type of infection involves multiple microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\nFrancis, who has served as pope since 2013, has faced recurring health issues in recent years. As a young adult, he developed pleurisy, leading to the partial removal of one lung. His history of lung infections has made him particularly vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.\nWhile the Vatican has not disclosed whether the infection is bacterial or viral, medical experts note that bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, whereas viral infections typically require supportive care to help manage symptoms.\nThe Vatican has stated that Pope Francis will remain in hospital for as long as necessary. There is no confirmed timeline for his discharge, leaving questions about his ability to resume his full schedule in the coming weeks.\nAs the Holy Year unfolds, millions of Catholics worldwide continue to pray for the pope’s swift recovery, hoping he will soon be able to resume his pastoral duties.\nMelissa Enoch\nFollow us on:",

    "text": "6 Best RV Insurance Companies of 2024\nInsuring your RV is essential, whether you plan to live in your RV full-time or use it for occasional trips.\nLike auto insurance, an RV insurance policy provides financial protection in the event of accidents, injuries and other unfortunate scenarios. This means it can reimburse you for repairs, hospital bills and liability expenses in the event you injure someone or damage their property.\nTo find the best RV insurance providers, we vetted 16 companies and researched how each performed in the areas of customer satisfaction, financial stability, coverage options and availability. We settled on six companies including Good Sam as the best RV insurance broker, National General as the best for full replacement cost coverage and Auto-Owners Insurance as the best for customer service.\nRead on to learn more.\nOur Top Picks for the Best RV Insurance Companies\n[Good Sam](#good-sam)- Best RV Insurance Agency [Nationwide](#nationwide)- Best for Multiple Discounts (#national-general)- Best for Full Replacement Cost Coverage (#progressive)- Best for Disappearing Deductibles (#roamly)- Best for Renting Out Your RV [Auto-Owners Insurance](#auto-owners)- Best for Customer Service\nBest RV Insurance Reviews\n- Offers full-timer coverage\n- Manage your policy online without having to contact an agent\n- Membership gets you discounts on campsites, gear stores, fuel and more\n- Not a direct insurer\nWhy we chose this company:\nGood Sam Insurance Agency is the best option for those who need help choosing coverage. It connects you with some of the best RV insurance companies and helps you get a comprehensive policy that fits your needs.\nGood Sam works with well-known insurance companies like Progressive, Foremost, Safeco and National General. Some standard insurance options you can get through Good Sam include comprehensive, collision, liability, property damage and personal injury protection.\nGood Sam is also an excellent option for people who drive their RV across the border to Mexico. The company partners with MexicoInsuranceOnline.com, which can pair you with one of three Mexico-based insurers. Agents can recommend add-ons for your cross-border travels based on your specific needs, and you can purchase policies for a single-day trip or longer.\nThe company also offers a storage discount, which lets you pause collision and liability coverage when your motorhome or trailer is stored for more than 30 consecutive days. This can help you save on monthly premiums if you only use your RV for occasional road trips.\nLastly, the agency can help you customize a full-time RV insurance policy if you use it as a permanent residence.\nInsurance options\nFull replacement cost, full-time RVer, emergency expenses, personal effects and RV roadside assistance\nDiscounts\nStorage option, multi-vehicle, paid-in-full, multi-policy, safety and anti-theft devices\nBundles\nVary by provider\nLearn more:\nGood Sam RV insurance review\nWhy we chose this company:\nRVInsurance.com can help you find a suitable policy, whether you use your RV for vacationing or as your residence.\n- Specialists can help you find a policy\n- Policies available for all types of RVs\n- Not a direct insurer\nRVInsurance.com works with Foremost, National General and Safeco. These companies cover all types of RVs, from motorhomes to campers. They offer several policy add-ons, such as full replacement cost, full-timers liability coverage and roadside assistance.\nYou can get an insurance quote online, but an insurance specialist can help you compare policies if you call.\nInsurance options\nCar, home, boat and motorcycle insurance. Full replacement cost, permanent attachment, personal belongings, full-timer liability and roadside assistance coverage\nDiscounts\nStorage savings, disappearing deductible, safe/responsible driver, low mileage, paid-in-full\nBundles\nVary by provider\n- Free yearly insurance review to evaluate your coverage options and possible discounts\n- Optional towing coverage includes lodging, transportation and meals\n- Multiple policies available, making it easy to bundle and save\n- Quotes not available online\nWhy we chose this company:\nNationwide Insurance offers over 10 different discounts, including discounts for staying claim-free during the previous policy period or installing safety devices, like smoke detectors.\nMost RV insurers offer discounts that can help you save on premiums. Nationwide's discount list, however, is particularly extensive. You can save money if you bundle your RV policy with your existing home insurance, take safety courses, belong to an RV organization (such as the National RV Association), pay your annual policy upfront or purchase the company's full-time RV insurance package.\nNote that not all discounts are listed on Nationwide's website, and some only come up during the quoting process. For example, according to a customer service representative, the company also offers discounts to customers whose vehicles have safety features such as tire-pressure monitoring systems or fiberglass bodies.\nInsurance options\nRoadside assistance, safety glass replacement, towing & labor, vacation liability, replacement cost\nDiscounts\nMulti-policy, multi-vehicle, RV safety course, RV association, paid-in-full, good driver\nBundles\nHome or auto insurance. Two or more ATVs, boats, motorcycles, snowmobiles or scooters\nLearn more:\nNationwide RV insurance review\n- Coverage for specialized equipment such as solar panels\n- Pause your coverage when your RV is in storage\n- Experts help you find a new RV in the event of total loss\n- Low mileage discount\n- Eligibility, benefits, coverage and discounts vary per state\n- Limited information about policies on its website\nWhy we chose this company: Full replacement cost coverage can usually only be bought during an RV's first model year.\nNational General, on the other hand, lets you get the rider within an RV's first five model years.\nWith full replacement cost coverage, also known as total loss replacement, your RV gets replaced with a new or similar one if it’s totaled or stolen. You may also get reimbursed for the original purchase price of the vehicle.\nThis type of coverage is typically only available for newly purchased motorhomes or travel trailers up to one or two model years old. For example, a 2023 model would probably be eligible until 2025. So if you buy a used RV or don't insure your new one as soon as possible, you risk your vehicle being considered ineligible.\nWith National General, on the other hand, RVs are eligible during their first five model years. The company can also insure your RV whether you're the first owner or not — some companies limit this type of coverage to original owners.\nThe company lets you pause your coverage when your RV is in storage, an option that’s not available with many other providers. You can save money by suspending collision and personal injury riders, for example. However, your RV would still be covered against theft, fires, harsh weather and other non-collision accidents.\nInsurance options\nPersonal belongings, vacation liability, specialized equipment, permanent attachments, full replacement cost, purchase price guarantee, countrywide towing and roadside assistance, emergency expenses\nDiscounts\nMulti-vehicle, diminishing deductible, storage savings\nBundles\nBundle RV insurance with nine other types of policies from National General\nLearn more:\nNational General RV insurance review\n- Accident forgiveness for claims under $500\n- Horse trailer coverage up to $50k\n- Pet injury coverage available\n- Add-on coverage available for roof malfunction\n- Standard plan doesn't cover personal property replacement or emergency expenses\n- Insurance rates can vary if you buy online or through an agent\n- Discounts are not available in all states\nWhy we chose this company:\nProgressive offers disappearing deductibles, accident forgiveness and an extensive array of discounts.\nWith Progressive, you can save on premiums if you’re the RV's original owner or if you pay your policy in advance, among other discounts. However, what makes Progressive’s discount list stand out are disappearing deductibles and accident forgiveness.\nNot many companies provide these discounts, and if they do, they only offer one or the other. With disappearing deductibles, the longer you go without filing a claim, the lower your insurance deductibles get.\nProgressive deducts 25% from your total deductible amount for every claim-free policy period. After four consecutive claim-free periods, your deductible will be $0. Other insurance companies that offer disappearing deductibles cap the discount to a maximum of $500 — if your deductible exceeds $500, you'd still have to pay the remaining amount.\nDisappearing deductibles, also known as vanishing deductibles, have an additional cost.\nHowever, the feature is included if your vehicle is valued at $25,000 or more and you purchase the comprehensive and collision coverage package. Both riders are recommended since they ensure the vehicle is covered for car accidents and non-collision events, like a fire.\nAccident forgiveness — which keeps your premium rates from increasing if claims are for $500 or less — is included at no additional cost.\nInsurance options\nRoadside assistance, total loss replacement, replacement cost/personal effects, vacation liability, full-timers liability, loss assessment, emergency expense, pet injury, road protection, pest damage\nDiscounts\nMulti-vehicle, advance quotes, original owner, pay-in-full, responsible driver, prompt payment, disappearing deductibles and more\nBundles\nBundle with home, renters, auto, boat or motorcycle\n- Specializes in RV insurance\n- Coverage even when renting out your RV\n- Policies for full-time RVers is available\n- Covers Canada rentals\n- Only offers RV policies\nWhy we chose this company: Insurers typically decline coverage if you rent your RV to someone else. With\nRoamly, you can rent out your RV and still be covered for liability and damage to the vehicle.\nRented RVs require comprehensive commercial insurance because they're exposed to more risk than personal vehicles. Renting out your motorhome or camper without insuring it can result in denied claims, especially if the renter doesn't have coverage either.\nWith Roamly, your RV is always covered when listed in rental platforms like Outdoorsy (which owns Roamly). When someone books your RV through Outdoorsy, they can purchase a renters protection package. These policies can include trip protection, interior damage and travel medical insurance.\nRoamly covers rented RVs for actual cash value during a rental period. Also, policies include $1 million in liability insurance protection during each trip.\nInsurance options\nTotal loss replacement, roadside assistance, full-timer rv and motorhome, RV rental, commercial RV\nDiscounts\nMilitary discount\nBundles\nNone — Roamly specializes in RV insurance\nLearn more:\nRoamly RV insurance review\n- Premium reduction if RV is equipped with certain safety features\n- Towing and roadside assistance in all 50 states and Canada\n- Mobile app for Apple and Android\n- No online quotes\nWhy we chose this company:\nAuto-Owners is our pick for personalized customer service because of its network of independent agents, online customer center and mobile app. Customers can access claims, billing and other important policy documents on their phone, tablet or computer.\nAuto-Owners has an impressive customer service record, with fewer complaints on record with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) than most competitors. It also ranked above average in the southeast region in J.D. Power’s 2022 Auto Insurance Customer Satisfaction study.\nUnlike other companies, Auto-Owners only sells its insurance products through independent agents. Instead of contacting the company online, you work directly with local agencies which can better advise you regarding specific insurance requirements in your area. For example, bodily injury and property damage liability limits set by law vary by state.\nInsurance options\nUninsured/underinsured motorist, personal property, roadside assistance, additional expenses\nDiscounts\nPayment history, paid-in-full, paperless billing, advance quote, safety features, driver safety program, mature drivers, favorable loss history\nBundles\nMulti-policy, life multi-policy\nLearn more:\nAuto-Owners RV insurance review\nOther RV Insurance companies we considered\nDuring our research for the best recreational vehicle insurance providers, we narrowed down our initial list to 11 companies. The following didn't make our final cut, not because they were lacking, but because other competitors had more standout features.\nAAA\n- Covers motorhomes, travel trailers and campers\n- Membership plan includes roadside assistance, hotel discounts and more\n- Extra coverage for lodging and transportation if your RV is damaged\n- Coverage options are not standard across regions (southwest, northeast, etc.)\n- RV policy not available nationwide\n- Limited information available online\nAAA offers coverage for different types of RVs and some of its policies also cover personal effects such as electronics. However, it didn’t make our list because their coverage is not available in all 50 states.\nAllstate\n- Discount if you transfer from another insurance company\n- Discounts for drivers 55 years or older\n- Gas price locator to help you find the cheapest gas\n- Limited information on company website\n- Online quotes not available\nAllstate’s policies include emergency travel expenses if you’re over 50 miles from home when your RV breaks down and the issue is covered under the policy. Allstate is not on our main list because it only provides quotes through its sales agents and the information on its website is limited.\nGeico\n- Windshield deductible is only $50 for total replacements\n- Personal effects replacement limits up to $100,000\n- Free accident forgiveness for those who have been accident-free for 5+ years\n- Limited information available on the company's website\n- Enhanced RV coverage is not available in HI, MA, MI and NC\n- Availability of total loss replacement coverage varies by state and vehicle value\nWhile Geico offers coverage options comparable to those of other companies on our list (such as total loss replacement, emergency expenses coverage and vacation liability), its policies aren't available nationwide. Its website also lacks crucial details, such as available discounts.\nSafeco\n- Loan or lease protection coverage available\n- Deductibles diminish $100 per year up to $500\n- Insures motorhomes valued at up to $1 million\n- Coverage available for custom equipment\n- Only covers vehicles used 250 days or less per year\n- Limited information available on website\n- No online quotes available\nSafeco offers coverage for class A, B, and C motorhomes valued at up to $1 million, but it only insures these vehicles if you use them recreationally. Safeco didn’t make our list because its website doesn't offer a lot of information and coverage is limited to vehicles used less than 250 days a year.\nForemost\n- Coverage for emergency expenses if camper is damaged or destroyed\n- Pays for transportation of damaged RV to storage, repair shop or home\n- Full-timer coverage for travel trailers, motor homes, luxury motorcoaches and more\n- Special policies for USAA members\n- Not available in DC or Hawaii\n- Limited information on website\nForemost, a subsidiary of Farmers Insurance, has policies for full-timers as well as stationary travel trailers. It also covers personal-use motor homes that you occasionally rent, lease or loan. Unfortunately, this policy doesn’t cover the vehicle while it’s rented, leased or loaned.\nFarmers\n- Part-time users can opt for storage-only insurance during the off-season\n- Policy extends to travel anywhere in Canada\n- Insures equipment permanently attached to your RV\n- No information regarding discounts\n- No online quotes\nDespite offering coverage in Canada, Farmers Insurance fell short of our list due to limited information on their website regarding specific coverages and discounts. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for consumers to assess the scope and value of its policies.\nUSAA\n- Discounts for safe driving and original ownership\n- Multi-vehicle discount\n- Coverage for all RV classes, including slide-on campers\n- Members get a 5% discount on policies\n- Policies only available to military families\n- 5% members-only discount not available in all states\nUSAA offers RV insurance through an alliance with Progressive, which covers almost all types of RVs. The drawback to USAA’s policies is that they’re only available to military families.\nCountry Financial\n- Multi-policy discount\n- Mobile app for Apple and Android devices\n- Only available through agents\n- Operates in only 19 states\n- Limited information available on website\nCountry Financial's RV insurance policies fall under home or auto insurance. That can be a drawback for consumers who already have a preferred auto or home insurer. Another notable snag in its coverage is that it’s available in only 19 states.\nNational Interstate\n- Options for RV full-timers\n- 25% deductible discount for each consecutive claim-free year\n- Windshield replacement coverage\n- Coverage for commercial RVs\n- Only available through agents\n- Website lacks information about terms and discounts\nNational Interstate has policy options for RV full-timers and covers commercial RVs. This insurer is not featured on our main list because its website doesn't provide details regarding policies or discounts.\nThe Hartford\n- Lifetime guarantee for repairs done in authorized repair shops\n- 24/7 claims submission\n- RV replacement if it's totaled in the first 15 months\n- Only available to AARP members\n- Not available in U.S. territories\nThe Hartford allows policyholders to customize their RV insurance coverage, and its lifetime guarantee for repairs in authorized shops is a highlight of its policies. However, coverage is only available to AARP members, which is a considerable drawback.\nRV Insurance Guide\nMost RV insurance providers offer comprehensive policies covering everything from collisions, theft and loss of personal belongings to medical expenses and more. However, not everyone needs an all-inclusive policy, especially those who use their RVs occasionally.\nRead on to find out how much RV insurance costs, learn about the different coverage options available and get tips on choosing the right coverage for your needs while saving on premiums.\nTable of contents\n[How much is RV insurance?](#howmuch) [Types of RVs](#rvtypes) [Types of RV insurance](#insurancetypes) [What does RV insurance not cover?](#notcover) [How to buy RV insurance](#buy) [Renting out your RV](#renting)\nHow much is RV insurance?\nAccording to Progressive, an RV insurance policy for a travel trailer (an RV that you tow behind your own vehicle) costs an average of $573 per year, while coverage for a motorhome costs an average of $958 per year.\nThe cost of an RV insurance policy is influenced by the following factors:\n- The type of RV: Motorhomes are more expensive to insure than trailers (especially motorhomes with state-of-the-art components).\n- Age and condition: Older trailers and motorhomes cost less to insure than their modern counterparts due to their reduced resale value.\n- Type of RV insurance: A policy with just liability coverage is more affordable than a comprehensive policy that includes collision and personal property coverage.\n- Where you live: As with most other types of insurance, your state and zip code affect your insurance rates. RVs in areas prone to extreme weather will be more expensive to insure.\n- Driving experience and driving record: A first-time RV owner poses a higher risk than someone who's been living the van life for years. Insurers will also look at your general driving record to determine an appropriate rate.\n- Claims history: Just as with auto insurance, a lengthy claims history is a red flag to insurers. A driver who has never filed an insurance claim will get a much better rate than one who has cashed in on their policy in the past.\n- Additional coverage: Purchasing add-ons that augment your standard coverage can substantially increase your premium. Additional coverage options may include roadside assistance, total loss replacement, vacation liability and full-timers coverage.\nTypes of RVs\nRecreational vehicles, more commonly known as RVs, can be classified into one of four categories: Class A, Class B, Class C and towable RVs. The first three are motorhomes, which means they're drivable units equipped with living quarters and appliances. Towable RVs, also called campers or trailers, can have home amenities too. However, some are designed to transport animals or cargo.\nHere's the rundown of the different types of RVs available:\nClass A motorhomes\nClass A motorhomes are the most luxurious and spacious. They are similar to commercial buses, measuring anywhere between 24 to 45 feet in length and fitting as many as 12 passengers. However, their size can make them difficult to drive and limits their mileage to around 10 miles per gallon or less.\nClass B motorhomes\nClass B motorhomes, also known as “camper vans,” are the smallest and least expensive type, with a length of 17 to 19 feet. These are standard-sized vans usually packed with a compact kitchen, bathroom and foldable or fixed bed. Their limited living space makes them suitable for four passengers or less who enjoy minimalist traveling.\nClass B+ or B Plus motorhomes\nClass B+ or B Plus motorhomes are the big siblings of Class B camper vans. These vehicles measure between 17 and 30 feet, fitting bigger beds and more spacious bathroom and kitchen areas.\nClass C motorhomes\nClass C motorhomes are the middle ground between Class A and B RVs. They measure between 21 to 41 feet in length and are easily recognized by their over-cab sleeping or storage area.\nAlthough smaller than Class A RVs, Class Cs are suitable for full-time occupancy, delivering better gas mileage and easier maneuverability. These vehicles can fit up to eight passengers and include a fully equipped kitchen and spacious dining, bathroom and living room areas.\nTowable RVs\nTowable RVs are pulled by hitches on SUVs, pickup trucks or any vehicle that can tow the RVs weight. Towable RVs that feature living quarters include fifth wheels, toy haulers, travel trailers and pop-up campers. These range from under 10 feet for pop-ups to 30 feet for fifth-wheel trailers.\nTruck campers are also considered towable RVs, but you don't pull them with a hitch. Instead, they sit on the bed of a pickup truck. Other types of towable RVs include utility, cargo and horse trailers.\nTypes of RV Insurance\nSince RVs can be both a vehicle and a primary residence, there are special considerations when insuring them. Some policies only offer basic liability protection while others offer broader coverage for things like personal effects and emergency expenses.\nKeep in mind that if your RV is self-propelled, your coverage should meet your state's minimum liability insurance requirements. This applies whether you use the vehicle occasionally or as a residence.\nIf your RV is towable, the insurance policy on the vehicle used to tow it may extend to the RV. However, note that the towing vehicle’s policy usually only covers liability and not physical damage to the RV or attached accessories.\nBest RV insurance features for part-time RVers\nPeople who use their motorhomes for weekend getaways should at least have basic liability coverage that meets their state's minimum requirements.\nOther types of RV insurance for part-time RVers include:\n- Property-damage liability coverage: Pays for damages that you cause to another person’s property or vehicle.\n- Bodily injury liability coverage: Helps pay the medical expenses of those you injure in an at-fault accident.\n- Collision coverage: Covers repairs to your RV after an accident with another vehicle, whether you’re at fault or not.\n- Comprehensive coverage: Pays for damages caused by theft, vandalism, natural disasters, fire and other non-collision accidents.\n- Uninsured/Underinsured motorist coverage: Covers the cost of repairs to your RV and your medical payments if you’re in an accident caused by a driver that doesn’t have insurance or has insufficient coverage to pay your claim.\n- Personal Injury Protection (PIP): Covers medical expenses for both you and your passenger in the event of an accident, no matter who was at fault. It may also cover lost wages.\n- Campsite/vacation liability coverage: Helps pay for legal expenses if you’re found at fault for injuries or losses suffered by a non-family member while in your campsite area or inside your RV.\n- Roadside Assistance: Offers around-the-clock repairs, towing and emergency assistance should your RV experience a flat tire, battery discharge or other malfunction.\nBest RV insurance features for full-time RVers\nFor added peace of mind, full-time RVers should consider having a more comprehensive policy that includes some of the above-mentioned add-ons as well as any of the following:\n- Personal property coverage: Covers the cost of replacing any damaged or stolen personal effects. This includes clothing, furniture, jewelry and computers, for example.\n- Total loss replacement: Replaces your RV with an equal or similar model if your vehicle is ever stolen or totaled in an accident. In other cases, the insurer may reimburse you for the original purchase price. Note that lenders may require this coverage if you finance your RV.\n- Full-time RV liability coverage: Adds additional coverage for liability and medical expenses if you live in your RV for six months or more each year.\n- Emergency expense allowance: Covers up to a specified amount of living and travel expenses like car rentals, lodging and food if your RV leaves you stranded, usually more than 100 miles away.\n- Specialized coverage: Can replace appliances like awnings, satellite dishes, and solar panels and can even provide coverage for any pet injuries that happen in the vehicle.\n- Loss assessment: Helps cover fees charged by RV associations for damage to common areas in a campsite, for example.\nWhat does RV insurance not cover?\nRV insurance won't cover the following:\n- Normal wear and tear: RV insurance protects your vehicle against unexpected events, not routine maintenance or deterioration.\n- Mold damage, fungi or rot: Insurers consider mold a sign of neglect and won't cover damages unless it's directly linked to water damage caused by a covered event.\n- Certain types of water damage: RV insurance doesn't cover water damage that's caused by regular wear and tear, freezing temperatures or manufacturer defects.\nComprehensive RV insurance covers most natural disasters, including flash floods, storm surges and fire. Earthquake coverage varies by insurer — it may be covered under a comprehensive RV policy or you may need to purchase earthquake coverage separately.\nHow to Buy RV Insurance\nHere are some tips on how to find and purchase the right RV insurance coverage for you.\nTake time to shop around for insurance quotes\nThe cost of RV insurance will depend on your driving history, where you live, the type of vehicle you own and whether you intend to live in the RV full-time or use it for vacations. Adding optional riders like pet and accessories coverage will hike up your premium.\nRequesting multiple RV insurance quotes can work out to your advantage. Those who compare estimates and coverage options before choosing often find the best rates.\nIf you don’t have the time to shop around, you can consult an independent insurance agent. They can help you choose the right coverage and guide you to companies with attractive rates and policy features that meet your needs.\nConsider bundling multiple policies\nMost insurance providers offer a multi-policy discount when you combine your RV insurance with other qualified policies.\nYou can save on premiums by combining your RV policy with your current auto, home or\nboat insurance. Some insurers also let you bundle your policy with renters or life insurance policies. Bundling multiple policies under one provider can also help you avoid the hassle of dealing with different companies come time to file a claim.\nIf you don't want to pay two premiums, you can consider adding your RV to your existing\nauto insurance policy. Just know that the insurance you have on your car usually only extends to towable campers or trailers, not motorhomes. Also, keep in mind that car insurance may cover you against liability and damages to the RV, but not belongings or appliances inside the vehicle. Homeowners insurance may also offer some coverage for RVs, but only when the vehicle is parked on the insured property’s premises.\nAnother option is getting\numbrella insurance to cover your RV. This type of policy covers liability claims that exceed the limits of your primary auto, home or RV policy. However, this coverage only kicks in if your RV is covered by an underlying policy that meets the liability requirements of the umbrella policy.\nCheck for available discounts\nWhile these may vary by company, most insurers offer rate discounts for:\n- Paying the total annual policy upfront\n- Making monthly payments on time\n- Staying claim-free during the previous policy period\n- Being the vehicle's original owner\n- Installing safety features in your RV (a tire pressure monitoring system, for example)\n- Having a favorable loss history (the record of insurance losses associated with the vehicle)\n- Being a safe driver (staying accident-free for at least three years)\n- Taking safety courses\n- Being a member of an RV association\nDrivers aged 50 and up can snag a lower rate, as can parents or guardians who opt not to insure drivers under 25 on their policy.\nInsurance when renting an RV\nIf you plan on\nrenting an RV for a vacation, you should consider getting RV rental insurance. This type of policy is similar to car rental insurance since both usually provide liability, collision damage waiver, personal accident or personal effects coverage.\nPolicies can be purchased through the rental company or your own insurance provider — if it offers such coverage. However, keep in mind that your current car or RV insurance policy may already extend some coverage to the rented RV. Coverage may not be available in all states or for trips longer than 30 days, so you should call your insurer to verify before heading out.\nSome insurance companies also offer RV coverage for trips to Mexico. While this type of policy can be useful for someone planning a vacation, it is more commonly recommended for RV owners who frequently cross the border.\nRenting out your RV\nIf you rent your RV to others, it's considered a commercial-use vehicle, and your insurance policy won’t cover the renter. The person must obtain their own rental insurance for the trip. If you’re merely lending your RV to a friend or family member, your existing coverage may extend to them, depending on the details of your policy.\nHowever, note that some states — including Arkansas and Wisconsin — require drivers to get special licenses to drive RVs. If you live in one of these states and you lend your RV to someone, that person must have the required license if you want your insurance policy to cover them.\nWhat kind of insurance do I need to rent out my RV?\nTo rent out an RV, you'll need at least liability coverage, which pays for damages or injury you may cause to other people and their property in an at-fault accident.\nWith the exception of New Hampshire, all states and the District of Columbia, require that vehicles, including RVs, have some form of liability coverage.\nInsurance for towable RVs is another matter. When you're towing your RV behind another vehicle instead of driving it, you only have to worry about having enough coverage to protect your belongings, not about additional liability insurance.\nRV Insurance FAQs\nHow much is RV insurance?\nWhat states require trailer insurance?\nTrailer insurance requirements vary by state and by type of trailer. Most local governments require liability insurance, while others also require uninsured motorist coverage.\nThere are currently only two states that don't require any type of trailer insurance. You can drive an uninsured vehicle in Virginia as long as you pay an uninsured motorist fee. In New Hampshire, you can drive uninsured if you prove you have enough money to cover liability expenses in an at-fault accident.\nDo you need trailer insurance?\nYou don't need insurance for a non-motorized trailer that's hooked up to a towing vehicle. The vehicle's insurance coverage extends to the trailer attached to it. However, this coverage is typically limited to liability.\nTalk to your auto insurance provider if you want to add property damage coverage for the trailer or purchase a separate RV insurance so that the trailer itself is insured against damage.\nWho has the best RV insurance?\n[how to buy RV insurance](#buy).\nWhat kind of insurance do I need to rent out my RV?\nYou'll need at least liability coverage for all motorized RVs, which pays for damages or injury you may cause to other people and their property in an at-fault accident.\nWith the exception of New Hampshire, all states and the District of Columbia, require that vehicles — including RVs — have some form of liability coverage.\nInsurance for towable RVs is another matter.

    "text": "A round of applause for Floyd Mayweather, who's been at the forefront of supporting the people of Israel amid their war against Hamas since the terrorists' attack on Oct. 7. Mayweather's contributions have gone above and beyond, even visiting Israel this week to cheer up soldiers and citizens alike. According to the Daily Mail, the 50-0 boxing legend landed in Tel Aviv this week. From his cameos with small Israeli businesses to uplifting members at an Israeli Defense Force military base by hosting a barbecue, Mayweather's generous givings have been welcomed by the Israeli people in alarming need. Mayweather voiced firm support for the people of Israel after Hamas' attacks. He provided immediate help back in October by sending a private jet full of supplies to the Israelis. During his recent trip to Israel, Mayweather received The Champion for Israel award and the Lifesaving Award due to his benevolence towards the nation. He also linked up with Israeli pop star Osher Cohen during his concert performance. Check out Mayweather's highlights from Israel: Not Everyone's Onboard With Mayweather's Goodwill The boxer has exhibited a profound respect for Israel, which is why his acts of charity have been overlooked by the media and fellow celebrities. Hollywood made its anti-Israeli sentiments public at the Oscars on Sunday. Several actors sported red buttons on their apparel for the night in support of Palestine. Rather than denounce the rabid and growing antisemitism in America, Hollywood's elite continued blaming Israel for genocide. One award-winning director even 'renounced\\\" his Judaism to support Palestine … seemingly forgetting the terror of Oct. 7. Mayweather's charity has been attacked on social media using hideous language directed at the boxer and the nation of Israel. Are progressives concerned with Mayweather's sentiments of support for the innocent Palestinian lives lost in the war? Of course not. The reactionary comments from pro-Palestine activists have called Mayweather a \\\"slave\\\" to Israel and condemned the boxing champ for \\\"supporting genocide.\\\" The cesspool of online hate toward Mayweather perfectly showcased the hypocrisy of America's pro-Palestine campaign demanding human rights for all but not the people of Israel. \\\"The paper must be worth selling your soul,\\\" one X user commented. \\\"Floyd Mayweather is a disgrace to his ancestors,\\\" another comment declared.
