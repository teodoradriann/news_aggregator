    "text": "\\xc8 il virus H5N1 la causa dell\\u2019influenza aviaria che ha colpito un adolescente della British Columbia, in Canada, ricoverato al BC Children\\u2019s Hospital di Vancouver in condizioni che i media locali definiscono critiche. Sabato 9 novembre il ragazzo \\xe8 risultato presumibilmente positivo all\\u2019influenza aviaria H5 e in queste ore l\\u2019Agenzia della sanit\\xe0 pubblica canadese (Phac) ha confermato il primo caso umano di H5N1 contratto nel Paese. Secondo quanto emerso dal sequenziamento genomico, il virus che ha infettato l\\u2019adolescente \\xe8 correlato a quello che sta alimentando un focolaio di aviaria tra i polli in British Columbia , ha spiegato la Phac, precisando che finora non sono state rilevati altri casi nell\\u2019uomo e sono in corso indagini per determinare come il ragazzo sia stato contagiato.\n\\nMentre gli Usa stanno fronteggiando un\\u2019epidemia di H5N1 nei bovini da latte , in Canada \\u2013 ha evidenziato l\\u2019agenzia nazionale \\u2013 non sono stati segnalati casi di influenza aviaria nelle mucche e non sono state riscontrate evidenze di virus aviario nei campioni di latte. Inoltre, il clade del virus H5N1 rilevato nei bovini statunitensi \\xe8 diverso da quello riscontrato nel teenager canadese. Il rischio di influenza aviaria nella popolazione generale resta basso, rassicura il Phac. \\xc8 pi\\xf9 alto per chi ha esposizioni non protette ad animali infetti.\n\\n\\nLa notizia del primo caso sospetto di influenza aviaria H5 nella provincia canadese della British Columbia era stata ufficializzata dai vertici sanitari sabato 9 novembre. La fonte dell\\u2019esposizione al virus \\xe8 al momento sconosciuta. L\\u2019epidemiologa e funzionaria sanitaria della provincia Bonnie Henry aveva spiegato che si presumeva che il virus fosse H5N1 perch\\xe9 circola nella provincia. Per il giovane paziente i primi sintomi, che si sono manifestati una settimana prima del ricovero, sono stati congiuntivite, febbre e tosse . \\u201cPrima di questo\\u201d, prima cio\\xe8 di contrarre il virus, \\u201csi trattava di un adolescente sano, che non presentava patologie pregresse\\u201d, ha evidenziato l\\u2019esperta in conferenza stampa. La malattia \\xe8 progredita fino a diventare sindrome da distress respiratorio acuto (Ards) .\n\\nIl paziente, che sembra essere al momento il primo caso umano noto di influenza aviaria contratto in Canada, sta ricevendo farmaci antivirali. C\\u2019era stato un caso nel 2014, ma correlato a viaggi, ha ricordato Henry. Non si sa ancora come l\\u2019adolescente si sia infettato con il patogeno che in Nord America circola ampiamente tra gli uccelli selvatici, il pollame e alcuni mammiferi, tra cui i bovini. Il teenager si \\xe8 sentito male il 2 novembr e, \\xe8 andato in pronto soccorso, \\xe8 stato dimesso e riportato in ospedale qualche giorno dopo, quando le sue condizioni sono peggiorate. Le autorit\\xe0 canadesi hanno sotto monitoraggio pi\\xf9 di 40 persone entrate in contatto col paziente durante la fase contagiosa.\n\\n",

    "text": "WSB Cox articles Atlanta man can only be taken off life support with this legal document, family says Ashli Lincoln December 29, 2023 at 12:06 AM · 2 min read Link Copied Read full article\nThe family of an Atlanta man on life support says it will be up to a judge to decide if he can be taken off.\nThey want to warn others about an important document they say families should get to prevent the courts from stepping in.\n[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ]\nAttorney Jennifer Hyman says an advance directive for healthcare can save families’ heartache and court battles.\n“It’s similar, in a way, to getting a will done. It’s a legal document that tells your healthcare providers how you want your medical treatment in the event you need life-sustaining treatment,” said Hyman.\nRajesh Shinde says he wishes his family had one of those documents when discussing removing his brother from life support.\n“He’s going to be in the vegetative state for the rest of his life,” said Shinde.\nShinde says it’s been an agonizing five years watching his younger brother on life support.\nTRENDING STORIES:\n19-year-old arrested for shooting, killing woman inside Atlanta McDonald’s, police say\nUtah couple killed in car crash on way to announce pregnancy to family at Christmas\nPolice nab alleged 40-year-old Ga. drug dealer trafficking nearly 7,000 fatal doses of fentanyl\nShinde told Channel 2 investigative reporter Ashli Lincoln his brother suffered a brain aneurysm in 2018.\nNow a state judge will have to decide if he can be taken off of life support after his brother’s ex-wife petitioned for him to remain on life support.\n“This is a tough situation that a lot of families have to go through,” Shinde told Lincoln.\n“What you heard is kind of a classic case (of) why people need to get these advanced healthcare directives,” Hyman explained.\nHyman says getting an advance medical directive is relatively simple by contacting an attorney and completing the necessary paperwork. The state of Georgia expanded advanced directive laws in 2007 and similar expansions are happening nationwide.\nThis year the Uniform Law Commission expanded the Health Care Decisions Act to make it easier for people to create and use advance directives.\nFor information on Georgia’s Medical Directive, click here .\n[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter ]\nIN OTHER NEWS:\nView comments",

[More than one million migrants have entered the US since Joe Biden became US President](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/joe-biden-million-migrants-enter-us-since-presidency) nearly four years ago. Southern states have attempted to take matters into their own hands, before being shut down by the Biden administration. Earlier this month, Texan Governor Greg Abbott ordered a razor wire to be installed on the US-Mexico border, but the plans were overruled by the Supreme Court, following a request from the US government. Lauren Chen has slammed Joe Biden for 'ignoring' the Southern border Reuters / GB News America A Supreme Court ruling stated that federal government can remove Texas’s barriers in the area. However, Texas Governor Dan Patrick has vowed to continue putting up more fencing. Patrick told Fox News: \"We are putting up wire everywhere we can. We will continue. We will not stop. If they cut it, we will replace it.\" Biden is also facing escalating tensions in the Middle East, after a deadly drone strike on a US military base killed three soldiers and injured nearly 40 others. [Biden told media](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/joe-biden-holds-iran-responsible-for-attack-on-us-military-base) following the attack that he \"holds Iran responsible\", but admitted we \"don't need a wider war in the Middle East.\" Former US President Donald Trump has called Biden \"weak and surrendering\" towards the Middle East Reuters LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: [Former US President Donald Trump](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump) has hit out at Biden's \"weak and surrendering\" efforts in the Middle East, stating we are \"on the brink of World War 3\". Speaking to GB News America, Political Commentator Lauren Chen slammed the Biden administration for prioritising foreign affairs over the issues sweeping America. Chen told host Patrick Christys: \"The American people are not happy right now, especially when people from Congress, not just Joe Biden, people are banging the war drums. \"And to that I have to say to Joe Biden, to the people like Nikki Haley or Lindsey Graham, no more going out for wars until you finish your wars at home. \"The American southern border, it seems is completely open. It's being invaded. We have a fentanyl crisis, we have homelessness, we have a crime wave across blue cities.\" Lauren Chen says Americans are 'not happy' with Joe Biden's administration GB News America Chen fumed: \"The American people can't afford to simultaneously be funding either peacekeeping efforts or anti-terrorist efforts when there are so many problems that still exist domestically.\" In a scathing comparison to the Trump administration, Chen highlighted that there was a \"novel\" absence of wars and conflicts that America engaged was not in during his time in office. Chen explained: \"Now fast forward to Joe Biden, we have conflict in the Ukraine, we have conflict in the Middle East that seems to be growing rapidly in terms of its scope. \"And we also have worsening with tensions with China over Taiwan.\"",

    "text": "ROMA (ITALPRESS) - Missione compiuta per la Lazio, che doveva vincere per certificare la qualificazione agli ottavi di Europa League e lo ha fatto con una prestazione super contro la Real Sociedad, battuta 3-1. Marco Baroni conferma in blocco i centrocampisti e gli attaccanti visti nell'ultima di campionato contro il Verona, mentre nel reparto arretrato tornano titolari Romagnoli e il \"portiere di coppa\" Mandas, complici anche le assenze per squalifica di Gigot e Pellegrini. Avvio cauto per i biancocelesti che però, appena alzano la pressione, passano in vantaggio: punizione di Tavares dalla trequarti, pallone che si impenna e tocco di Castellanos che favorisce Gila, bravo a risolvere la mischia con un potente tiro sotto la traversa. Sucic e Kubo provano a scuotere gli ospiti, ma è ancora la Lazio a sfiorare il gol: Remiro chiude su Dia, e sugli sviluppi del calcio d'angolo il tentativo di Castellanos viene respinto da Mendez sulla riga, mentre il tap-in di Gila sbatte sul palo. Sul cambio di fronte, legno colpito ancora da Sucic con un tiro dal limite su cui Mandas non sarebbe mai arrivato. La formazione basca si fa vedere anche in contropiede con Becker, ma la partita cambia alla mezz'ora quando Munoz commette un secondo fallo da giallo su Isaksen e lascia i suoi in dieci. La Lazio annusa l'occasione e la sfrutta immediatamente con un cinismo invidiabile: al 32' Isaksen pesca in area Zaccagni, che non sbaglia un rigore in movimento, mentre due minuti più tardi Tavares fa partire un cross tagliato a trovare il perfetto inserimento di Castellanos, che di testa fulmina Remiro.Il secondo tempo è normale amministrazione per la Lazio, che tiene costantemente il possesso palla nella metà campo della Real Sociedad, davvero troppo passiva e arrendevole. Il guizzo più pericoloso lo porta il solito Pedro, che al 76' sfrutta una giocata di Noslin, quasi anticipandolo, ma centra in pieno la traversa da pochi passi. All'82' prima proiezione offensiva della ripresa per gli ospiti, che trovano il gol della bandiera con il tap-in di testa di Barrenetxea dopo il tocco di Mandas sul cross di Aramburu. L'unica macchia della serata per la Lazio è l'infortunio di Tavares, uscito al 41' toccandosi l'inguine dopo l'ennesimo scatto.- foto Ipa Agency -(ITALPRESS).\nIn Breve\ngiovedì 23 gennaio\nAccadeva un anno fa\nAttualità\nCronaca\nTI RICORDI COSA È SUCCESSO L’ANNO SCORSO A GENNAIO?\nAscolta il podcast con le notizie da non dimenticare\nAscolta \"Un anno di notizie da non dimenticare 2024\" su Spreaker.",

Les gelées vont encore s'accentuer au cours des prochaines heures et progresser davantage. Le froid peut-il encore s'intensifier dans les prochains jours ? Retrouvez nos toutes dernières prévisions dans cet article.\nLe froid s'est déjà bien installé, et les températures sont restées très basses sur de nombreuses régions au cours des dernières heures. Par endroits, là où la grisaille persiste toute la journée, les températures peinent à grimper et ne dépassent pas 2 ou 3 degrés au meilleur moment de la journée.\nLe froid devrait d'ailleurs s'accentuer aujourd'hui, avec des gelées un peu plus marquées qui vont également gagner du terrain géographiquement. Ce vendredi sera-t-il la journée la plus froide de la semaine ? Le week-end pourrait-il être encore plus froid ? Retrouvez nos toutes dernières prévisions dans cet article.\nDes températures déjà froides !\nDes températures déjà froides ont été relevées au cours des dernières heures. L'amplitude thermique est parfois très faible entre le matin et l'après-midi dans les zones où les brouillards et les nuages bas persistent toute la journée. En revanche, lorsque le soleil parvient à s'imposer – comme ce fut le cas hier après-midi dans le sud-ouest de la France – les températures gagnent une dizaine de degrés en l'espace de quelques heures, devenant alors un peu plus douces.\nHier, à [Metz](https://www.tameteo.com/meteo_Metz-Europe-France-Moselle-LFSF-1-26140.html), la ville a enregistré 1,1°C le matin et seulement 2°C au meilleur moment de la journée, en raison d'une épaisse couche nuageuse qui est restée présente toute la journée. Même constat au Havre, où le mercure est passé de 3,7°C le matin à 4,1°C l'après-midi. Les températures relevées hier après-midi sur le nord de la France étaient souvent 4 à 5 degrés en-dessous des normales de saison.\nEn revanche, dans le sud du pays, là où les grisailles se sont dissipées pour laisser place à de belles éclaircies, les températures ont nettement augmenté. À [Limoges](https://www.tameteo.com/meteo_Limoges-Europe-France-Haute+Vienne-LFBL-1-26135.html), après un début de journée à 0,8°C, la ville a atteint un maximum de 12,2°C. Dans les Landes, à Pissos, le mercure est passé de -2°C le matin à près de 13°C l'après-midi, soit un gain notable de 15 degrés en l'espace de seulement quelques heures.\nDe nombreuses gelées ce matin !\nCe matin, les gelées sont nombreuses, parfois plus marquées qu'hier, et ont tendance à s'étendre géographiquement. Les températures sont souvent négatives sur une large moitié nord du pays.\nDans le détail, il est prévu ce vendredi matin : -3°C à Auxerre, -2°C à [Nancy](https://www.tameteo.com/meteo_Nancy-Europe-France-Meurthe+et+Moselle-LFSN-1-26104.html), Reims, Dijon, Lyon, Grenoble, Le Mans et Poitiers, -1°C à Brest, Rennes, Nantes, Lille et Limoges et 0°C à Cherbourg.\nLes nuages attendus dans le sud devraient permettre à ces régions d’échapper aux gelées, avec 4°C à Bordeaux, 5°C à Toulouse, 7°C à Perpignan et Marseille et 8°C à Nice ainsi qu’en Corse.\nLes températures ne décollent pas en journée !\nMalgré le retour de quelques éclaircies dans le nord-est cet après-midi, les températures auront une nouvelle fois beaucoup de mal à grimper.\nLa carte ci-dessous montre que les températures resteront très nettement en-dessous des normales de saison cet après-midi sur le nord du pays, avec des valeurs souvent 3 à 5 degrés inférieures à ces normales.\nDans le détail, il est prévu 2°C à Strasbourg et Nancy, 3°C à Dijon, 4°C à Lille, [Paris](https://www.tameteo.com/meteo-Europe-France-Ile+de+France-Paris-1-1-135-29-5461.html) et Reims, 5°C à Cherbourg et 6°C à Rennes et au Mans.

He vowed to battle in courtroom. I don’t wish to speak about refunding the cash – returning the Buddha statue. At midnight final evening, cops from the Nakhon Sawan Provincial Detective Group introduced two husbands and wives to be handed over to investigators on the Mang Nakhon Sawan Police Station and ready to be despatched to the Nakhon Sawan District Courtroom for prosecution in accordance with legislation. Nakhon Sawan police then spent a very long time monitoring down and arresting Mr Thanaporn, referred to as “Rut Nakhon Sawan” in amulet professional circles and a former member of the Thai Amulet Affiliation’s amulet overview committee. He and his spouse Ms Amornrat fled a case below the Offenses Associated to the Use of Checks Act and are at the moment in Chiang Rai province.

Mr. Thanaphon himself as soon as held a reputable place within the business. However Mr. Tanavon brought about bother in every single place and it was reported in lots of locations. Mr. Thanaphon as soon as did this himself by taking a pretend amulet and pretending to be an actual monk. After I needed to test many locations, I knew it was a pretend monk. The report was made however the firm has but to return the cash in any method. Mr. Thanaphon will deliver the amulet till an settlement is reached. 564 of their very own, totaling 380 million baht, have been launched for worship, however used the cash for private bills and refused to return the cash as agreed.

    "title": "Flee From Heresy is flawed, sloppy, and often erroneous - Catholic World Report",
    "text": "When reading Bishop Athanasius Schneider’s Flee From Heresy: A Catholic Guide to Ancient and Modern Errors , I was reminded of a shameful act from my youth. My then six-year-old younger sister complained to me one day about a boy in her class she said was harassing her at school. I was immediately filled with a brotherly sense of chivalrous outrage and so I dutifully sought out the lad and roughed him up a bit, which was not difficult since I was four years his elder and a towering 4’4’’, 90lb, behemoth. It wasn’t horrible—no blood was shed. However, and herein is the lesson, I had brutalized the wrong kid, who had the simple misfortune of possessing a superficial resemblance to the real offending marauder. And my sister was not at all happy since the boy I had accosted was a friend of hers!\nScattered attacks\nThis episode came to mind because Bishop Schneider begins his book by spelling out his rationale and motivations for focusing on heresy and other doctrinal errors. He makes it clear that his attacks on the various theological errors he lists in the book are motivated by a sense of charity and, indeed, even a sense of knightly chivalry:\nThe one who truly loves, living by authentic charity, will combat whatever comes between him and the object of his love. The knight fights valiantly to save his bride, the mother protects her child, the soldier defends his homeland.\nUnfortunately, in his rush to defend doctrinal truth from error as he sees it, Bishop Schneider often misidentifies various theologians and theological schools of thought as doctrinally erroneous when in fact they are deep allies of the theological orthodoxy he claims to be defending. As in my narrative of youthful chivalry, he has misidentified as enemies those who could be his theological friends. But he roughs them up all the same since his barometer for what counts as doctrinal truth is a purity test for orthodoxy drawn from a narrow reading of Neo-Scholastic texts–the kind of reading that gives Neo-Scholasticism a bad reputation–and which he wields in unnuanced and unsophisticated ways.\nAnd in so misidentifying theological friends of orthodoxy as enemies, he undercuts his entire project by engaging in an indiscriminate and scattershot blunderbuss-like attack on everyone standing in the room after 1962.\nJust like the blunderbuss, his book is accurate at short range with easy to identify heresies, but wildly inaccurate the further away his target is standing from the putative doctrinal errors he falsely ascribes to them. As with his previous book Credo (an unfortunate attempt at undermining large chunks of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I reviewed in these pages) this latest book is just fine when dealing with obvious heresies like Arianism and Docetism (easy close-up targets).\nBut it is much less so when he starts to identify modern theologians with whom he disagrees as purveyors of dangerous doctrinal errors. Sometimes he hits the right targets. But often he does not, and this changes the entire tone and tenor of the text from a laudable attempt at defending doctrinal truth into a polemic against any theology that pushes beyond the categories–both theological and liturgical—of Baroque Tridentine Catholicism.\nSloppy condemnations\nIn this regard, the title “Flee From Heresy” could be more aptly re-titled “Flee from the Nouvelle théologie , the Vatican II Church, and its Papal Promoters”. Because in the midst of his entirely correct criticisms of errors including religious relativism, moral relativism, gender ideology, progressive Catholic heresy, and so on, Bishop Schneider unwisely and unfairly targets ressourcement theologians such as Hans Urs von Balthasar and Henri de Lubac as purveyors of doctrinal error. Further, he goes on to claim falsely that Pius XII condemned the whole movement in Humani Generis in 1950.\nPope Pius XII never mentions a single theologian by name, nor does he ever refer to “the Nouvelle théologie ”, although he implies it indirectly. But his reticence to name it explicitly is important since it indicates a certain reserve on the part of Pius in a manner very common to papal condemnations. To wit, he names an error but then leaves it open for others to adjudicate the question of to whom the errors might be attributed.\nPius was well aware of the debates between Thomists like Garrigou-Lagrange and theologians like de Lubac on the issue of the proper relationship between nature and grace. Pius’s concern in this debate was with making sure that Thomistic principles be given pride of place since so many of the Church’s doctrines make use of Thomistic categories in their formulations. He was also rightly concerned with certain tendencies among some theologians toward an exaggerated immanentism, subjectivism, and historicism.\nBut he also clearly does not want to put his papal thumb too heavily on one side of the scales in the dispute between Lagrange and de Lubac, nor does he condemn de Lubac or the Nouvelle théologie explicitly, leaving it to others to decide if the “new theology” falls under his various warnings or not. Was Pius XII “suspicious” of the “new” theology? Yes, he most certainly was. But a pope’s private suspicions are not magisterial teaching. It is wrong to accuse, as Bishop Schneider does, the Nouvelle théologie and theologians like de Lubac of having been explicitly condemned by Pius XII. Because they weren’t.\nBut this example from his book is indicative of the superficial and careless nature of this text, in which theologians of enormous stature and proven depth are just summarily dismissed as error factories unworthy of further consideration. It is indeed true that Pius XII, in Humani Generis , condemned a few very specific theological propositions. But what is condemned, as any careful scholar will tell you, are positions not held by de Lubac, Balthasar, or any of the other leading lights of the ressourcement movement. To accuse de Lubac, Balthasar and a host of other fine ressourcement theologians of being advocates of an illegitimate and runaway immanentism, historicism, and subjectivism is absurd.\nDe Lubac himself said he agreed with the condemnations in Humani Generis and that none of them were applicable to his theological views. And the fact that in little more than a decade after this encyclical he will be a key theologian at the Council on the orthodox side of the aisle, and that after the Council he was a strong critic of the progressive wing of the Church that was misinterpreting the Council, is indicative of the fact that he was anything but a purveyor of the doctrinal errors about which Pius was concerned.\nThe deeper question, which Bishop Schneider ignores, is whether the determination of what counts as orthodox theology had not been overly narrowed in very constricting ways in the previous three centuries in the Church. Therefore, theologians like de Lubac—and, later, no less a light than Joseph Ratzinger—were thoroughly justified on theological grounds for pushing back against this sclerotic constriction of theological orthodoxy. This further explains why they met resistance from some in the hierarchy until it became abundantly clear that their theology was not only thoroughly orthodox, but actually one of the greatest theological achievements of our time. And that Vatican II must be read as a ressourcement Council in order to avoid the misrepresentations of it that came later–misrepresentations vehemently opposed by de Lubac, Ratzinger, Balthasar, and others.\nOne can cast a jaundiced eye at all of this, as Bishop Schneider clearly does, but to lump these theologians together with the “modernists” is inaccurate and unfair. Furthermore, his inattention to their theology causes him to underestimate both the ongoing significance of Vatican II and its achievements.\nThis highlights an inherent flaw in Flee From Heresy since it is, like Credo , in an “interview” question-and-answer format, with the Bishop offering up short and breezy summaries of every error he can think of, from serious heresies like Arianism, to things that are not at all heretical like praying Mass in the vernacular with the priest facing the people. It reads like a simple listing of every theologian, theological school, liturgical practice and pastoral decision by the modern Church with which he disagrees. That is his right. But, once again, and to put it bluntly, it is overall a hot mess of indiscriminate blunderbuss scattershot targeting of everything dancing in the ecclesial ballroom for the past sixty years.\nThe attack on Hans Urs von Balthasar\nThis tendency to impute doctrinal error to theologians with whom he disagrees is no more apparent than in his treatment of Hans Urs von Balthasar. He takes issue with Balthasar’s now famous assertion that we can at least hope for the salvation of everyone. Balthasar’s entire theological work was massive and truly one of the greatest theological achievements in the entire history of the Church. It was not without reason that he was a close friend and collaborator with Joseph Ratzinger and greatly admired by Karol Wojtyla. Balthasar’s founding of the journal Communio with Ratzinger (along with de Lubac and a few others) in order to combat the theological progressivism swamping the Church in the late Sixties is further testimony to his enormous stature. Which is also why, as I can personally attest to as a doctoral student fighting to write a dissertation on Balthasar at a very Rahnerian Fordham Unversity in the early 1990s, Balthasar was attacked and dismissed by the theological guild as a hopeless theological reactionary.\nDespite all of this, for Bishop Schneider “Balthasarianism” is a doctrinal error meriting only one sentence of descriptive condemnation. He states tersely: “Named for Swiss priest Hans Urs von Balthasar (+1988), entertains hope for universal salvation, and that hell is empty.” Which directly implies that for Bishop Schneider hoping for the salvation of all is a doctrinal error, a fact he makes clear when he later states there can be no “reasonable” hope for the salvation of all since Christ gives us an eschatological census (apparently) in Matthew 7:14 and lets us know that most folks are going to hell. If Bishop Schneider wishes to hold a very narrow view of salvation and to believe that the vast majority of people are going to hell, that is his right. But he is wrong to equate that view with “orthodoxy” as such and to hold that more expansive views of salvation are unorthodox.\nIn that same section he also lumps together, unfairly and uncritically, the Balthasarian view about hope with the theology of apokatastasis . I say that this is unfair because in Dare We Hope “That All Men Be Saved “, his book on the topic, Balthasar explicitly rejects apokatastasis as heretical and theologically untenable. He also explicitly rejects universalism as a dogmatic proposition. It is therefore deeply uncharitable of Bishop Schneider, intellectually speaking, to imply that Balthasar’s hope is just a closeted universalism and a veiled endorsement of apokatastasis , when Balthasar himself gave very strong arguments in this book (and elsewhere) against both of those views, deliberately positioning his own views in direct contrast with them.\nThis is simply not how one does theology. This is instead how one does polemic, and sadly, the book is marred throughout by this kind of superficial rhetoric and analysis. Which means that Bishop Schneider’s primary complaint with Balthasar should not be that he teaches heresy, but that he teaches something on a point of theology with which Bishop Schneider disagrees. Because the Church clearly does allow us to hope for the salvation of all. Indeed, she enjoins us to pray for the same. Why would she ask us to pray for something that is a dangerous and erroneous hope?\nIronically, on this point, it is Bishop Schneider who is in danger of falling into doctrinal error. The Church herself, in her Eucharistic liturgy and in the Liturgy of the Hours, asks us in places to pray for the salvation of all. I do not see anywhere in the rubrics where there is an asterisk next to those prayers indicating that they are in vain and that we should pray them with deep mental reservations and our fingers crossed. What are all of those prayers of intercession for in the Good Friday liturgy where we pray for the conversion everyone? Can we dispense with the tedium of all of that and cut it down to a few prayers indicative of a more provisional and “eschatologically realistic” hope of mass damnation? Why does St. Paul ask us to pray for the salvation of everyone? Was he a closeted crypto-Balthasarian? Why does Our Lady ask us to pray at the end of each decade of the Rosary, “lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy”? Was she just having a bit of cheeky fun with us here? Was she in effect saying, “pray for all that all may go to heaven, but don’t get your hopes up because my Son has already stated that this is false.”\nFurther problems\nBishop Schneider says things as well that come dangerously close to the idea one must have explicit faith in Christ and be an explicit member of the Catholic Church in order to be saved. In answer to the question “Is explicit faith in Jesus Christ necessary for contemporary Jews to be saved?” he answers: “Yes, the same as with all men” Two pages later, he states it is necessary to belong to the Catholic Church in order to be saved, saying,. “This is the meaning of the affirmation often repeated by the Church Fathers, popes, and councils: extra ecclesiam nulla salus .”\nBut this is not the teaching of the Catholic Church. While it is true there is today a dangerous religious relativism and a presumption of heaven, it is not at all true the Church teaches that extra ecclesiam nulla salus means one must be an explicit member of the Catholic Church in order to be saved. This would, for example, come as a big surprise to Pope Benedict XVI, who stated in Spe Salvi (46-48) his opinion that the damned will be few and that most folks will probably have to pass through purgatory. But then again, perhaps Pope Benedict is also a suspicious modernist for Bishop Schneider.\nBishop Schneider also accuses Vatican II of teaching error in the matter of religious freedom (the great bogeyman of the so-called traditionalists) and that the assertion in Lumen gentium (a dogmatic constitution, by the way) that Muslims are in the theological stream of Abrahamic faith, is an error. He finds nothing of value in the “false religions” of the world and seems to reject the patristic notion that one can find the logoi spermatikoi and the “spoils of Egypt” in places outside of the Church. He says flatly that there is no way that these false religions can be vessels of grace in any way at all. But this excludes the view they can be vessels of a kind of “preparatory grace” by which the Spirit operates outside of the Church to “prepare the soil” in some real way for conversion.\nHe affirms that people have a “natural right” not to be coerced in matters of religious conscience by the State, but then states that people do not have a natural right to advocate for their false religion in the civic public square. But what if the religious faith in question here places moral obligations on its adherents precisely to promote its views in the public sphere? In such a case, the government does indeed have an obligation, according to Bishop Schneider, to “coerce” such individuals into silence and to force them to choose between their civic well-being and their moral conscience.\nTherefore, it would seem that for Bishop Schneider the only kind of non-Catholic religion that is “allowable” is an utterly privatized one, which is a view representing a serious curtailment of the importance of the “religious sense” in human beings. In so limiting the religious sense to inner private “feelings and beliefs” one establishes a thoroughly modernist view of religion, including the Catholic Faith, as an essentially private affair. The only difference being that Catholicism is recognized by the State as “true” and imposed from above through various means of coercion. Is it any wonder then that it is precisely countries such as Ireland and Spain who have had a long history of existing as Catholic confessional States which secularize and spiritually unravel the fastest once those religious establishments are dissolved?\nFurthermore, and in line with the above, Bishop Schneider sets himself against Vatican II’s treatment of non-Catholic religions as vessels of preparatory grace. For that matter, it would seem he also would have to pull St. Paul aside after his speech about the “Unknown God” at the Areopagus and correct him for seeing in the false gods of the pagans anything of preparatory value. Because in Bishop Schneider’s book, there is no nuance in these matters. Grace is either salvational grace or it is not at all. Religions come in only two varieties: utterly false, bordering on the demonic, and Catholicism.\nThe great Anglican scholar C.S. Lewis, in his wonderful Mere Christianity , states that one of the ways God gets his divine revelation across to us is in what Lewis calls “good dreams”. By that he means the entire realm of human mythopoesis, and the territory of what Luigi Giussani termed “the religious sense”. Certainly, there is much error in the world’s various mythic and religious constructions, and the gospel needs to correct those. But the gospel also takes what is good in our religious sense and lifts it up and transforms it into a moment wherein conversion to Christ becomes possible.\nIndeed, where Bishop Schneider errs in his scorched earth approach to non-Catholic religions is in his failure to recognize a simple reality. Which is this: unless there is always already something in the human religious sense that is a truthful and existentially valid anticipation of Christ, even if just in an inchoate and confused way, then there would be no way for us to recognize the truth of Christ when he presents himself to us. He would instead appear to us as something utterly foreign and alien. This is just as our eyes need to have the capacity to see light in order to see the sun.\nConclusion\nFinally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that Bishop Schneider states the Pope has no authority to abrogate the old Mass and therefore that the faithful are under no obligation to obey any papal decree which does so. I can sympathize with what motivates this view, as I think Traditionis Custodes was a pastoral mistake, and I think the Novus Ordo has liturgical deficiencies that need reforming.\nBut to say the pope has no power over this liturgy and that the faithful can essentially do as they please in this regard is not true. It is a dog whistle and a piece of red meat directed at the most radical elements of the traditionalist movement. I fail to see how such an approach to papal authority does not itself fall under the category of doctrinal error. One can disagree with a papal decision without denying the authority of the pope to make the decision and our obligation to follow it. Therefore, one should “flee” from Bishop Schneider’s views on papal authority over the liturgy.\nI could go on with further examples, but will forego them. It has pained me to write this review since I wanted very much to like Bishop Schneider’s book. There is a need these days for sound and clear articulations of the Catholic Faith. Sadly, this book is not that. This book is instead, like Credo before it, a thinly disguised attack on Vatican II, the theology that inspired it, and the post-conciliar papal magisteria of several popes. It is, I think, a hyper-traditionalist revisionist reading of Catholicism that mistakes theological friends of Tradition–the ressourcement theologians—as enemies of the same. It is therefore a missed opportunity and will be of little value outside of traditionalist circles.\nFlee From Heresy: A Catholic Guide to Ancient and Modern Errors\nBy Bishop Athanasius Schneider\nSophia Institute Press, 2024\nHardcover, 272 pages",
