    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Making sure that every employee receives the prevailing wage on a government construction job may sound easy if the company has 2 or 3 employees. Add in 15 employees, 31 compliance issues, a variety of job titles for the same employee and flawless security regarding employee information, well, then a group of payroll people need to handle the job.\nOr… a web-based system that seamlessly, finds any\nDavis Baconcompliance issues and alerts the payroll manager about errors that could lead to jail time or heavy fines. That same system offers a 3-minute payroll. Would a huge savings of time and money compared to a manually prepared payroll be a smart choice for a construction company that does business with the government?\nA worry-free payroll system for\nconstruction companiesdoing business with the federal government is available.\nCompliant Client by eMars was created in 2001 to give construction company owners an easy, flawless, paperless way to be compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931 that enforces a prevailing wage and 31 other compliance issues. This congressional act requires private contractors to be in compliance with each check paid to employees on all federally funded construction projects over $2,000.\nCompliant Client was designed with input from the Department of Labor and government contractors. Government auditors are given a portal to view the progress of every project. A real-time environment was created to block contractors from altering pay rates then submitting payroll.\nConstruction companies need this type of system to stay in compliance with the Davis Bacon Act.\nMany construction companies, however, prepare their payrolls manually. Humans make errors.\nCompliant Client by eMars is used by many construction companies.\nMore than 48,000+ users are handling projects in 45 states, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico use Compliant Client. This system processes between 2,000 and 3,000 payrolls a day. Some payrolls have thousands of workers. Other payrolls have as few as 15 employees.\nCompliant Client provides immediate, concurrent, real time visibility of all payroll records of the sub, prime, plus - the owner agency. All screens are printable via this paperless system. Every submitted payroll is audited, online and in real time. The results are instantaneous, allowing for immediate corrections.\nA typical payroll is prepared by 1 person in less than 3 minutes.\nCompliant Client requires a PC and about 30 minutes of training. Complete implementation takes less than 1 day. Users report an 80% productivity improvement over manual payrolls.\nCompliant Client also encrypts its at rest data.\n\"Security is tantamount\", says Woody Chamberlain, President of eMars/Compliant Client.\nMr. Chamberlain continued: “Users have a choice of 13 different security roles. Each role enables the user to perform defined processes.”\nEasily stay compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931.\nEncrypted. Strong. Easy to use. Web based. Fairly priced.\nWoody Chamberlain\neMars / Compliant Client\n+1 480-595-0466\nemail us here",

Below? — Ian MacEwan (@ianmacewan) [August 1, 2024] This week’s news. • More allegations of sexual assault and coercion against writer Neil Gaiman [were made public this week](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/neil-gaiman-denies-new-sexual-assault-and-abuse-allegations-by-two-women), as two women detailed their accusations on the podcast Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman, and another woman made public claims of being groomed and manipulated on the podcast [Am I Broken: Survivor Stories](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s4-ep2-claire-i-ignored-it-and-i-believed-him-because/id1491575384?i=1000663604978) - Gaiman has denied the allegations. • The California Department of Justice and the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force [this week announced](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-rob-bonta-san-diego-human-trafficking-task-force-target-human) that a human trafficking sting operation carried out during last week’s San Diego Comic-Con, which was aimed at “recovering victims of sex trafficking and targeting sex buyers using the San Diego Comic-Con Convention to seek out potential victims,” resulted in 14 arrests and the recovery of 10 victims of human trafficking - SDCC organisers [stated that](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-31/human-trafficking-sting-san-diego-comic-con) “While we were not made aware of this operation, it is our understanding that the arrests were made outside of the event.” • In less fraught SDCC news, the winners of this year’s Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were announced last Friday, with Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki taking home three prizes for Roaming, Becky Cloonan receiving awards for The Kelpie and Somna (with artist Tula Lotay), and the Will Eisner Spirit of Comics Retailer Award going to Florida’s Blackbird Comics and Coffeehouse, while The Comics Journal #309 took home the prize for Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism - a full list of this year’s winners [can be read here](https://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisner-awards/). • Elsewhere, cartoonist Roz Chast [has been announced](https://apnews.com/article/brooklyn-book-festival-2024-roz-chast-ad0a0e04b1cb2acda12ac12b792604fc) as the recipient of this year’s Brooklyn Book Festival Best of Brooklyn award, and the National Cartoonists Society announced that Bill Hinds [is to receive](https://nationalcartoonists.com/honoring-bill-hinds-with-the-gold-t-square-award-for-50-years-of-tank-mcnamara/) the organisation’s Gold T-Square award in recognition of 50 years of the syndicated daily comic strip Tank McNamara. • Nikkei Asia reports on mangaka-turned-Politician Ken Akamatsu, creator of Love Hina and now a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, continuing [to float ideas](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Artificial-intelligence/AI-companies-should-share-revenue-with-manga-artists-Japan-lawmaker) regarding the protection of artists from artificial intelligence companies, mooting the possibility for such companies to set aside revenue to reinvest in creative industries - Akamatsu has previously spoken about the possibility that AI companies may be [breaching copyright law](https://www.siliconera.com/manga-artist-ken-akamatsu-discusses-japanese-copyright-law-and-ai/) with their image generation, and suggested [other policy responses](https://restofworld.org/2023/generative-ai-japanese-politicians-manga/) that may be needed to protect creators’ rights. • At the opposite end of the spectrum is Forbes' reporting on former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's [new venture Lumi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/07/25/colin-kaepernick-is-launching-an-ai-company-for-creators/), which is, apparently, and I quote, “leveraging AI to streamline the creative process for comic books and manga, and could open up new avenues for storytellers who have traditionally faced high barriers to entry in the publishing world,” which it turns out is the exact combination of words needed to make me seriously consider flinging my phone into the Thames, so that I never have to run the risk of reading it again. • In memoriam, remembering those the world of comics has lost, and [news was shared](https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2024/08/01/la-mort-d-andre-juillard-maitre-discret-de-la-bande-dessinee_6263896_3382.html) this week of the passing of artist André Juillard, illustrator of Sept Vies de l'Épervier, and several volumes of the Blake and Mortimer series, amongst others, who has died at the age of 76.

TCJ • Jamey Keeton reviews the striking setting of Jasper Jubenvill’s [Dynamite Diva #4: The Engine Whispers](https://www.tcj.com/reviews/dynamite-diva-4-the-engine-whispers/) - “It has a level of heart to it that belies the violence and gore found throughout. It gets at something deeper, something transformative. It gestures at a paradoxical thesis that even anti-heroes carved from, and colored by, genre stuff—thriller, action, detective, vigilante, exploitation—can not only be redeemed but they can also be healed.” • Helen Chazan [reviews](https://www.tcj.com/legacy-comics-two-new-alternative-funnybooks/) the sharp wit of Joe Matt’s Peepshow #15 and the ribald humour of Caroline Cash’s PeePee PooPoo #1: The First Issue - “There is no “end” to alternative comics. Indeed, there may have never been an end to the underground. What has arrived is a new generation of cartooning, one looking back on the alternatives with the same askance view that the alternative cartoonist of the 90s looked back on comix of the 60s.” AIPT • Kevin Clark reviews the mediocre selection of BOOM!

It just creates a more dynamic space. [WESTVIND:] There’s something so alluring about the potential for relationships when you start putting images together. It is very enticing.

We’ll be studying visual storytelling from a European perspective and, I hope, meeting some of the world’s future stars of cartooning – who will surely be found wandering around somewhere in the vicinity of the Cathedral, soaking up its inspiration. “ • Finally for TCJ this week, Chris Anthony Diaz shares photographs from Comix Experience’s [35th birthday party](https://www.tcj.com/comix-experiences-35th-anniversary-party-a-photo-report/), which took place in March of this year - “When it first opened, it mainly carried mainstream comics and some indie comics and zines. Now, it fully stocks just about everything published by every cartoonist who released something in any format and length and genre (and is not out of print).” • For Nikkei Asia, Echo Wong reports on the popularity of Nagano’s manga [Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/China-s-stressed-young-people-find-solace-in-Japanese-manga) with readers in China, and why the book resonates in a nation with rising youth unemployment. • Over at The Hollywood Reporter, Roy Thomas writes on why Roy Thomas [receiving a co-creator credit](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wolverine-co-creator-roy-thomas-deadpool-and-wolverine-1235962212/) for the character of Wolverine is the correct course of action, actually, but still complains over the resultant billing order and how 'Roy Thomas' should have appeared first. Classic. • For ICv2, Rob Salkowitz reports from [last weekend’s San Diego Comic-Con](https://icv2.com/articles/columns/view/57478/san-diego-comic-con-2024-the-good-the-bad-ugly), and details the status quo of a cultural juggernaut that’s trying to build a head of speed back up, post-pandemic. • For Solrad, Tom Shapira [compares and contrasts](https://solrad.co/returning-to-the-scene-of-the-crime-tom-shapira-on-torpedo-1936-and-torpedo-1972) the anti-romanticism of Enrique Sánchez Abulí and Jordi Bernet’s Torpedo 1936 to Abulí and artist Eduardo Risso’s sequel Torpedo 1972. • Latonya Pennington writes for Shelfdust on Mildred Louis’ [Agents of the Realm](https://shelfdust.com/2024/07/31/the-sweet-maturity-of-romance-in-agents-of-the-realm/), examining how the webcomic is influenced by, but also builds upon and departs from, the traditions of the magical girl genre. • From the world of open-access academia, [for Dive-In](https://dive-in.unibo.it/article/view/20099), Camil Valerio Ristè analyses Shirono Honami’s I Want to Be the Wall and Isaki Uta’s Is Love the Answer? in the context of rising numbers of media in Japan that discuss asexual and aromantic identities. • In New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia, Linda Berube, Ernesto Priego, Stella Wisdom, Ian Cooke, and Stephann Makri [present results from a study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13614568.2024.2374291#d1e495) aiming to understand how readers experience and respond to digital comics and the devices used to access them. • For the Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, Mark Hibbett writes on the triplicate existence and evolution of The Beano’s [Dennis the Menace](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21504857.2024.2384439?src=exp-oa), and how these three ages of Dennis show the character’s changing with the times across nearly 75 years of publication. • Paul O’Brien’s survey of the villains of Daredevil continues, for [House to Astonish](https://www.housetoastonish.com/?p=10198), as this week the Man-Bull sees red before being put out to pasture. • Mike Peterson rounds up the week’s editorial beat, over at The Daily Cartoonist, as drawings of [Trump and Biden](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/26/csotd-before-after-and-juxtaposed/) gave way to illustrations of [Vance](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/28/csotd-satire-lies-and-misstatements/) (and sofas) and [Harris](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/29/csotd-wouldnt-you-prefer-a-good-game-of-tegwar/) (and the Olympics) and then [Trump](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/08/01/csotd-flaming-dumpster-causes-massive-train-wreck/) (again). — Paul (@PaulJonMilne) [August 1, 2024] Those are all of this week’s links, back next week with more, and a return of the audio/visual selection, as most of the usual suspects were absent this week, which is fair, in the aftermath of SDCC, and I’ve uhhhr been watching 16 hours of Olympics programming a day.

    "text": "综合美媒报道，当地时间3月4日，美国国务院宣布停止“全球空气质量监测”项目，美国驻外使领馆将停止发布空气质量数据。\n所谓“全球空气质量监测”项目创立于2008年，项目运作期间，全球80多个美国使领馆在屋顶上安装空气质量监测器，并将采集的空气数据进行实时共享。\n据法新社报道，美国国务院4日宣布因“预算限制”不再能够继续发布空气污染数据。美国国务院表示，历史数据将留存在环境保护署的一个网站上，但实时数据已于4日停止更新，并将在相关项目重新获得经费前一直处于宕机状态。据报道，美国总统特朗普上台后大幅削减了海外以及环境支出。截至记者发稿时，此前用于公布相关数据的页面已显示为“页面不存在”。\n美国国务院标志（资料图）图自美媒\n美国驻华使馆从2008年起开始监测并发布北京的空气质量数据，2011年开始发布广州的空气数据，2012年驻上海领事馆也开始发布数据。中国外交部发言人当时对此表示，外国驻华使领馆不具有在中国开展环境监测和发布相关数据的法定资质，也不具备从事环境监测的专业能力和条件。\n责任编辑：于璧嘉\n编辑：郭艳丽",

    "text": "转自：湖州日报\n　　记者 倪晶\n　　本报讯 “蓝莓便宜了不少!”近日，在湖城南华路上的一家超市内，市民张女士看到125克装的蓝莓标价12.99元1盒，当即选购了2盒。记者走访发现，近期湖城蓝莓价格普遍下调，相比之前动辄二三十元一盒的价格，“亲民”了不少。\n　　在湖城湖东路的一家水果店内，几盒125克装的大颗粒蓝莓被摆放在店内的“C位”。店员介绍，这批蓝莓产自云南，果径在22毫米以上，去年同期同规格产品售价超30元1盒，眼下只要15元1盒。在湖城新华路的一家连锁品牌水果店，下午1时许，售价13.8元1盒的125克装蓝莓已售罄。“近期蓝莓价格确实有所下降，很多老顾客一次买三四盒。”店员告诉记者，蓝莓价格走低带动销量上升。相隔不远的另一家水果店则打出团购优惠，果径18毫米以上的佳沃蓝莓125克装2盒售价36元，吸引了不少年轻消费者购买。\n　　线上平台的蓝莓价格也同样“美丽”。记者浏览多家生鲜电商平台发现，蓝莓价格低至8.99元1盒，优惠售卖的0.5公斤装蓝莓价格在70元内，吸引了不少消费者购买。\n　　为何蓝莓价格大幅走低？据业内人士介绍，今年是蓝莓“大年”，云南等地蓝莓产量的提高导致价格走低，预计到四五月份，随着蓝莓大量上市，还将迎来一波降价。",

    "title": "31 workers rescued after tunnel collapse in California; Project paused pending investigation - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Los Angeles, California – A late-night collapse inside a massive wastewater tunnel project in Wilmington trapped 31 construction workers underground on Wednesday, in a harrowing incident that shines a light on the dangerous and often unseen labor behind Los Angeles’ infrastructure ambitions. The collapse occurred along a 7-mile-long tunnel being constructed as part of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a $630.5 million project intended to modernize the city’s aging sewage system. According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, a section of the tunnel collapsed around 8:55 p.m., isolating the workers as much as six miles south of the tunnel’s sole access point near the 1700 block of North Figueroa Street. Despite the alarming nature of the collapse, all 31 workers were rescued alive and without visible injuries, fire officials said. The workers had managed to scramble onto a pile of soil beyond the collapse and were shuttled out several at a time by tunnel vehicle. Emergency crews, including all of LAFD’s Urban Search and Rescue teams, were mobilized in what officials described as a rapid and coordinated response. Four additional workers had entered the tunnel after the collapse to assist their colleagues, who were hoisted to the surface roughly an hour later. The project has now been placed on indefinite hold while authorities investigate the cause of the collapse. “This is a dangerous job,” said Chelsea Fernandez, whose husband was among those rescued. “Every day he goes in there, we don’t know if he’s going to come out.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the emergency response, calling the first responders “L.A.’s true heroes.” She visited the site shortly after the incident and spoke with several of the rescued workers. The tunnel, located 450 feet below ground, is designed to transport treated wastewater from the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant to the Pacific Ocean. It is part of a broader regional effort to overhaul Los Angeles’ water infrastructure and increase recycled water use, a decades-long project that city leaders hope will eventually provide half of L.A.’s drinking water. Constructed by Flatiron Dragados as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, the tunnel was intended to replace two aging sewage lines built in 1937 and 1958. Tunneling had been projected to finish by April 2025, with full activation scheduled for January 2028. That timeline is now in question, as city and county officials seek to determine what led to the collapse and how to ensure it doesn’t happen again. For now, the rescue stands as a rare stroke of good fortune in a situation that could have ended much differently.",
