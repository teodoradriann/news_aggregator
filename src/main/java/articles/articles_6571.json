    "title": "Bobbie Jean Carter Was Found Unresponsive in the Bathroom the Day She Died — Just Like Her Late Brother Aaron",
    "text": "Four days after Bobbie Jean Carter died at 41 years on Saturday, December 23, new details are coming to light about how she passed away. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office told TMZ that first responders were dispatched to Carter's Tampa, Fla., home on Saturday morning, where they found her and rushed her to the hospital. She was later declared dead. The sheriff said deputies learned Bobbie Jean was on probation for cocaine possession when she died, but her roommates told the authorities she hadn't used any narcotics since she was released from prison. The deputies did not find any narcotics or drug paraphernalia in Bobbie Jean's bedroom or bathroom, and there were no signs of foul play. Bobbie Jean's death is under investigation, and her official cause of death will be determined later by the Medical Examiner's Office, as they are still waiting for toxicology results. “Our office conducted the autopsy, and we are awaiting family to make arrangements to have her released from our facility,” a rep for the Florida medical examiner told RadarOnline.com . “Autopsy reports may take four to five months or longer to complete,” the rep added. As OK! previously reported, Aaron Carter also tragically died in the same way after drowning in his bathtub. According to the autopsy report, the \"I Want Candy\" singer, who passed away in 2022, took Xanax and huffing compressed air before submerging into the water. Bobbie Jean's mother, is now taking care of her granddaughter, 8-year-old Bella . Jane Carter , who also lost daughter Leslie Carter in 2012, gave a statement about Bobbie Jean following the sad news. Never miss a story — sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for! \"I am in shock from learning of the sudden death of my daughter, Bobbie Jean, and I will need time to process the terrible reality of this happening for the third time,\" Jane stated. \"[H]owever deeply a parent feels the loss of a child, the suffering of a young child at the loss of a parent must be much greater,” she added. “So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious eight-year-old granddaughter Bella, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother. When I am able to think clearly, I’ll release a fuller statement, but until then, I would request to be left to grieve in private.\"",

    "title": "Over 2 pounds of fentanyl seized in Martin County drug sting; 3 charged",
    "text": "MARTIN COUNTY − A narcotics sting in a Walmart parking lot netted vice detectives 2½ pounds of fentanyl − the largest volume of the drug ever trafficked in to the county − and three arrests, sheriff's officials announced Thursday. Martin County Sheriff's Office agents seized the drug, with an estimated $300,000 street value, Wednesday. Each of the three men, who officials said traveled from Bronx, New York, to Stuart to sell the 10,000 blue pills, are facing a potential minimum 25-year prison sentence if convicted for interstate drug trafficking. Sheriff William Snyder spoke Thursday afternoon at the Sheriff's Office about the operation. Typically, Snyder said, if detectives seized fentanyl, it was \"5 (or) 6 pills,\" but the total weight taken Wednesday made it, \"a record amount of narcotics.\" The pills were pressed and marked to appear as counterfeit opioid prescription painkillers, he said. \"... So this, had it hit our streets, we would've been awash in it,\" said Snyder. He cited what he said were local fatal overdose statistics: In 2022, 51 people died, while, so far, in 2023, 49 people have died in fentanyl-related overdoses. There were also \"a multitude\" of ongoing cases emerging this year that Snyder said could push 2023 past last year's total. \"...Our field tests indicate this is a high potency fentanyl ... so every one of those pills had the potential of killing whoever took them,\" he said. Yelson Daniel Alvarez-Ortiz, 25; Jeffry Ezequiel Gonzalez-Ortiz, 29; and Carlos Almonte-Melo, 35, were each charged with trafficking 4 grams or more of fentanyl. Snyder said they were part of \"a major trafficking organization with tentacles throughout South Florida.\" The men were said in arrest records to be part of \"a crew ... from New York\" who planned to sell the pills in Stuart for $38,000 in a deal set for 12 p.m. Dec. 27 at the Walmart Supercenter automotive parking lot in the 4000 block of Southeast Federal Highway. According to those records, when their black Toyota sport utility vehicle arrived, deputies used a \"vehicle immobilization technique,\" arresting the three men while one ran, was pursued and caught. The reports state the plastic bags full of fentanyl pills were found under a seat in the SUV. Detectives requested the men be held in jail without bond, saying in the arrest records, each frequented the Dominican Republic, none had ties to Florida and all were considered flight risks. Snyder said he hoped they would at least be given a $300,000 bail, but a judge \"for reasons I cannot tell you,\" set their bail each at $200,000. \"I suspect with that lower bond, they'll be out and they'll be gone and they are a flight risk,\" he said.

    "title": "NGT: NGT Orders Action Against Illegal Dyeing Units in Gurgaon Following Toxic Pollution Concerns | Gurgaon News - Times of India",
    "text": "Gurgaon: Taking suo motu cognizance of a TOI report that dyeing units were operating illegally in the city, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last month directed Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to carry out a survey and take action accordingly. The NGT bench of chairperson Prakash Shrivastava, judicial member Arun Kumar Taygi and expert member Dr A Senthil Vel on Sept 13 noted that the TOI report, titled ‘Dead units on paper, but still dyeing', raised \\\"substantial issues\\\" on compliance with environmental norms.The bench also issued notices to Union environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board, HSPCB and Gurgaon DC to submit their responses at least a week before the next hearing on Oct 16. \\\"The HSPCB is now tasked with surveying and taking action against these illicit units. The aforementioned news item indicates a violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,\\\" it said.TOI reported on Aug 22 that several dyeing units were officially closed, but continued to operate, specifically in Sector 103, Basai and Sector 36. Regulations dictate that only treated industrial waste can be released into the drain. But these units, which appear to be abandoned plots or warehouses, surreptitiously continue dyeing denims and hanging them out to dry.\\\"The article underscores that dyeing units are also categorised as ‘red' industries due to their high pollution levels, and these units are not authorised to operate outside industrial areas. However, they are found in proximity to residential areas, schools, and even the under-construction Sheetla Mata Medical College and Hospital. Residents have long expressed grievances about the malodorous, discoloured water in the drain, which changes hue depending on the dyes used. This pollution has rendered the lives of locals miserable, causing health issues such as asthma and skin rashes,\\\" the order said.The bench went on to cite the article for effects of exposure to heavy metals that are present in denim dyes, and previous orders to four Haryana districts — Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar — for surveying and inspecting dyeing units. Asked about NGT's latest order, HSPCB officials said on Thursday that they are taking action.",

    "text": "(Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\nOver the past two seasons since the Cleveland Browns acquired star quarterback Deshaun Watson, the three-time Pro Bowler has played in only 12 games for the franchise, which is obviously not ideal with how much the team has invested in their new leader under center.\nLast season, the Browns were hoping to see their bold move to trade for and sign Watson pay off, as the team was very talented on both sides of the football and could’ve potentially been a legitimate title contender in the AFC.\nAlthough the Browns did much better than expected after Watson suffered a season-ending injury, Cleveland wants the quarterback position to be as secure as ever and is counting on the 28-year-old bouncing back next season for this franchise to live up to expectations.\nApparently, Watson is making great progress in his rehab from shoulder surgery and is confident that he’ll be good to go for Week 1 of the 2024 NFL regular season via Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com.\n“I’ve put my whole life into this. I wanna make sure I come back better than before,” Watson said.\n#Browns Deshaun Watson on why he’s confident he’ll be ready for Week 1 at the opening of his Lefty’s Cheesesteak in Univ Hts pic.twitter.com/XPXz24epNC\n— Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) April 4, 2024\nIf Watson can get back healthy and return to form as one of the best quarterbacks in the league, the Browns will be a force to be reckoned with in the AFC once again and quite possibly a team that can contend for a Super Bowl title during the 2024 campaign.\nOnly time will tell if the Watson experiment works out in Cleveland because so far, the team’s brass is probably regretting the move to bring him in, but there’s a chance to turn things around with a solid outing next season.",
