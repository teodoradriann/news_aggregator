L'incidente è avvenuto intorno alle ore 14.30 di oggi. Sul posto sono intervenuti i vigili del fuoco di Schio (Vicenza) che hanno individuato l'auto, caduta per 20 metri sotto il livello stradale. Due operatori hanno cercato di raggiungere la persona con degli imbraghi, poi l'elisoccorso di Verona emergenza è arrivato sul posto, senza poter calare un soccorritore con il verricello, vista la presenza dei cavi di alta tensione. Grazie all'aiuto dell'elicottero del Soccorso alpino, la squadra dei Vigili del fuoco è riuscita a recuperare la malcapitata e a riportarla in zona sicura grazie a una \"teleferica\" allestita per l'occasione. La donna è stata trasferita all'ospedale di Vicenza. Sul posto anche la polizia locale di Valdagno. Le operazioni sono terminate dopo circa 3 ore.",

    "text": "ZurichLa révolte d'employés de La Poste gronde sur les boîtes à lettres\nDes autocollants renvoyant à un site internet marxiste sont distribués à Zurich. Ils dénoncent les conditions de travail dans un centre postal de tri des paquets.\nDes autocollants en soutien aux employés du centre de tri des colis d'Oerlikon, à Zurich, fleurissent sur les boîtes aux lettres de la ville, nous apprend l'«Aargauer-Zeitung», ce jeudi. Des anonymes ont récemment glissé un flyer et un sticker, imitant le graphisme de La Poste, dans le courrier des habitants pour dénoncer les conditions de travail sur le site zurichois.\nUn code QR renvoie sur une page internet d'un mouvement révolutionnaire zurichois (RAZ), décrit par le journal comme étant «marxiste». La principale revendication est de garantir une semaine à 42 heures. Un article de l'organisation liste plusieurs problèmes rencontrés par le personnel à Oerlikon, dont des semaines à 50 heures qui seraient devenues la norme et des exigences d'efficacité toujours plus élevées.\nConditions de travail analysées dans toute la Suisse\nIl est demandé à la population d'afficher l'autocollant sur les boîtes aux lettres, en solidarité avec les employés, jusqu'à ce que les revendications soient entendues par l'entreprise. Mais les auteurs de cette action ne sont pas connus. Syndicom affirme ne pas être impliqué dans cette campagne et s'en distancie. Le porte-parole, Matthias Loosli, précise qu'il y a bien des tensions autour des horaires de travail sur ce site depuis la fin de l'année. Comme une procédure est en cours entre les partenaires sociaux, Syndicom ne peut pas donner d'autres informations.\nLa Poste n'a pas commenté les reproches formulés par cette action. «Depuis décembre, il y a des défis à Oerlikon concernant la longueur des journées de travail, que nous examinons», déclare la porte-parole de l'entreprise Jacqueline Bühlmann dans l'«Aargauer-Zeitung». Elle ajoute que La Poste est actuellement en train de procéder à une «analyse approfondie de la situation globale à l'échelle de la Suisse, en ce qui concerne la charge de travail des collaborateurs, notamment dans le secteur de la distribution».\nPas d'autres actions en Suisse\nInterrogé sur la situation en Suisse, Syndicom dit attendre «avec impatience» les résultats de l'analyse de la la poste. Le syndicat «part du principe que des solutions seront rapidement trouvées en partenariat social pour réduire sensiblement la charge de travail des employés de la Poste dans toute la Suisse», commente le porte-parole Matthias Loosli. A la connaissance de la rédaction de «20 minutes», l'action des autocollants reste locale et n'a pas été menée en Suisse romande.",

    "text": "Opinion Pro-Hamas demonstrators marching in Munich, Germany. Photo: Reuters/Alexander Pohl\nThe Argentinian-born revolutionary, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, was assassinated in Bolivia in 1967 — but his memory endured for decades after his death, and for many he remains an iconic hero of the anti-establishment movement.\nI still vividly recall the fascination with Che — bordering on obsession in certain circles — during the 1970s and 1980s. The famous 1960 photograph of him taken by photographer Alberto Korda featured prominently on t-shirts and posters.\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono had a picture of Che in their kitchen, and the Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona had a Che tattoo on his right arm. Journalist Tom Wolfe coined the term “radical chic” to describe the promotion of radical figures such as Che by celebrities and the elite, who cheerfully used revolutionary icons as a fashion statement without any hint of irony.\nChe Guevara transcended global borders as a unifying symbol of the global progressive left’s commitment to anti-establishment struggles and transnational solidarity. His resolute image somehow came to represent universal egalitarian aspirations and the hope for a global socialist revolution.\nProgressive politics has always been riven with rivalries and hatreds, but notwithstanding the enmities, wherever someone found themselves on the map of the left, Che Guevara bridged all the many diverse movements across continents, serving as a powerful conduit for shared sentiments of resistance and revolution. Che literally embodied the perfect ideal of internationalist resistance.\nIn real life, however, Che Guevara was a monster. Despite Che’s global reputation as a lovable revolutionary, there was a very dark side to him, marked by immoral behavior and ruthless brutality. Behind the romanticized image of the charming rebel lay a man deeply embedded in the brutal and bloody violence of armed struggle. In the mountains of Cuba, and later in Bolivia, Guevara was not merely a theorist of guerrilla warfare but an active participant.\nCrucially, Che was personally responsible for overseeing the wanton execution of numerous individuals — executions he saw as necessary for the cause, but which by any objective standards would be labeled as cold-hearted terrorism.\nOne victim of Che’s brutality was Eutimio Guerra, a Cuban peasant who acted as a guide and informant for Fidel Castro’s rebel army. At some point, he was suspected of being the traitor providing information about the position of Che’s militants to the Batista regime.\nAccording to Che, as recorded in his diaries, Guerra eventually admitted his betrayal — although, that was only after he had been sadistically tortured for days. As soon as Guerra confessed, Che pulled out his pistol and shot him dead. Similar stories are many, attesting to Che’s ugly side — and yet he continued to hold the affection of many during his lifetime and afterward, and it goes on to this day.\nThe adulation of Che Guevara is the perfect example from history exhibiting both the stupidity and superficiality of ideologues. Once it has been decided that someone or something represents the ideals they hold dear, whether that someone or something fits the bill or not, they are put up onto the highest pedestal to be idolized as objects of veneration and celebration.\nAnd you don’t have to look at history to find an example: Hamas and the Palestinian cause have become the latest and most current iteration of this jarring phenomenon. Twenty-first-century radical chic is wearing a Palestinian checkered kaffiyeh as a scarf or shawl, while publicly lionizing the marauding monsters who murdered, raped, and kidnapped Jews and non-Jews in southern Israel on October 7th.\nThese terrorists, and their murderous leaders, such as the arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar, are now being held up as the ultimate icons of a virtuous cause: namely, the obliteration of so-called white oppression and colonialism.\nTruthfully, I fully support anyone’s right to espouse whatever ridiculous cause they consider worthy. What troubles me is when people claim to want a “ceasefire,” and then see no contradiction between that aspiration and the fact that they support animals who rape and butcher women, burn babies, joyfully kidnap old and young alike, and say that they would merrily do it again and again .\nAt what point does it become clear that pacifist progressivism is nothing more than a mirage that masks and protects, and even promotes, the same ugly violence its greatest advocates claim to despise? Those with an eye on history are clued in; they have heard of Che Guevara.\nBut even those who are clueless about history, and embrace radical causes out of naivete, should understand that claiming you hate despots when you support something far worse than despotism requires mental gymnastics that is nothing short of Olympic gold-medal standards.\nIn the Torah portion of Vayechi , there is a poignant moment of moral clarity illustrating this exact point. As Jacob lies on his deathbed, he rebukes his sons Shimon and Levi for their violent retaliation after their sister Dinah was wronged by Shechem. In a murder spree against the town of Shechem, the brothers dispatched the entire male population, took the women and children into captivity, and plundered the flocks and possessions.\nJacob’s critique was not of their cause, which he rightly felt was just, but rather of their brutal methods. His parting words underscore a timeless lesson: the ends cannot justify the means. As Jacob put it: “Cursed be their anger, so fierce; and their wrath, so cruel!” ( Gen. 49:7 ). His curse is against the ferocity of their violence, not the veracity of their cause.\nJacob, the great patriarch, can parse the situation: he supports the cause, but not if it employs violence as a first measure. Self-defense — even if it means using mortal force — is always justified, but premeditated murder is an inexcusable transgression, regardless of its motivation, especially if a resolution can be reached without it.\nThis ancient wisdom seems to elude many on the progressive left. The glamorization of violent revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Hamas overlooks the crucial distinction between fighting for justice and committing acts of terrorism.\nChe, much like Shimon and Levi, might have started out with what he and others perceived as noble intentions, but the path he chose was marred by indiscriminate brutality. Hamas similarly wraps itself in a cloak of righteous fervor, but in the final analysis is nothing more than a vicious terrorist group that seeks the death of Jews, and anyone associated with Jews — even if they are fellow Arabs.\nThe allure of radicalism often blinds its adherents to the moral cost of their actions, and they forget that, above all, what they seek must always be achieved via preserving the sanctity of life. Jacob understood the perils of falling into the trap of endorsing violence by supporting those with whom one has sympathy, but who resort to violent methods as a matter of course.\nJacob’s rebuke of Shimon and Levi carries within it a message for today — that supporters of the Palestinian cause must never romanticize violence and its perpetrators. It is one thing to sympathize with the plight of the oppressed, but it is quite another to be an apologist for terrorism.\nThe author is rabbi in Beverly Hills, California.\n ",

RTVM screenshot\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Saturday remembered Jose Rizal’s martyrdom and urged Filipinos to imitate the national hero and show genuine love of country.\n“On the 127th Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Dr. Jose Rizal, I thus enjoin all of you to keep emulating the timeless values we can learn from his life and works,” Marcos said in his message for Rizal Day on December 30.\n“I also call on everyone to let the genuine love for the country that he lived out and later died for propel us to have a deep and personal sense of ownership for our land and our future,” he added.\nMarcos said even in this day and age and more than a century since his death, Rizal’s influence could still be felt.\nHe urged Filipinos to strive to walk with the same purpose, passion, and nationalism in “our every endeavor so we may overcome all the challenges that stand in our way towards achieving a brighter tomorrow.”\n“With our meaningful commemoration, may the ideals and spirit of Dr. Jose Rizal live on as we fully realize the Philippines that he and his contemporaries fought hard for,” Marcos said.\nRizal’s martyrdom consolidated the Philippine independence movement which later led to the birth of the nation, he added.\nThe national hero’s patriotism started even while he was young, Marcos pointed out.\n“It began in his youth and childhood, when he embraced the wisdom of his family, teachers, and peers then, later on, embarked on a lifelong pursuit of excellence for a greater goal,” he said.\nBefore 7 a.m. on Saturday, Marcos laid a wreath at the monument of Rizal in Luneta Park in Manila.\nThe military band played the “Pilipinas Kong Mahal” hymn as Marcos walked toward the monument.\nA gun salute then followed.\nThe event was attended by the First Family, Cabinet members, Armed Forces chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. and other military officials, local officials led by Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna, and members of the diplomatic corps.\nSaturday, December 30, Rizal Day, is a regular holiday.\nRizal, an ophthalmologist by profession, wrote the novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo as he advocated for political reforms during the Spanish occupation.\nHe was convicted for the crime of rebellion and was executed in Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park or Luneta) on December 30, 1896. —KG, GMA Integrated News\nThis article Marcos to Filipinos on Rizal Day: Imitate Rizal, show genuine love of country was originally published in GMA News Online.",

Depois de tudo que aconteceu, né?”, afirma Luciana Trigotto, que é decoradora.\n“No momento tão triste que a gente tá vendo o estado, a gente aqui consegue se alegrar com essas obras e principalmente com essa dedicação, com esse carinho que eles fazem”, completa Ricardo Silva.\nHá 60 anos, os moradores de Flores da Cunha se mobilizam para fazer os tapetes de Corpus Christi. Dessa vez, além de expressar a fé, a comunidade prestou solidariedade aos atingidos pelas enchentes .\nQuem prestigiou os tapetes pôde contribuir com alimentos e produtos de higiene e limpeza .\n\"São cinco caminhões que saem e nós recebemos muita coisa. Nós conseguimos ter uma logística boa para conseguir encaminhar para cidades onde está precisando”, explica Nair Picolli Curra.\nEnchente afetou pelo menos 283 mil domicílios e quase 600 mil pessoas, diz governo do RS\nA solidariedade também foi demonstrada em Bento Gonçalves , onde cobertores e alimentos vindos de doações foram usados em Tapetes.\nEm Vila Flores , um tapete formado por cobertores e mantas para os atingidos ganhou forma na igreja matriz.\nA tradição, em São Marcos , foi substituída pela arrecadação de alimentos.\nNa única igreja consagrada à Corpus Christi na América Latina, em Vale Vêneto, distrito de São João do Polesine , fiéis se uniram em procissão.\n‘\"Tem que ter fé não pode desacreditar (...) Eu torço para que tudo isso passe uma hora vai passar e precisamos de solidariedade”, pede Arthur Panassol Bernardi, de apenas 11 anos.\n1 de 1 Fiéis arrecadam donativos para famílias afetadas por enchentes no RS — Foto: TV Globo/ Reprodução Fiéis arrecadam donativos para famílias afetadas por enchentes no RS — Foto: TV Globo/ Reprodução\nLeia também\nBento Gonçalves Flores da Cunha São João do Polesine São Marcos Vila Flores",

    "text": "Danish Ali objects to Sunehri Bagh Masjid’s proposed removal in letter to conservation panel\nNew Delhi, Dec 28 (PTI) Lok Sabha MP from Amroha Danish Ali has raised objections on the proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in the national capital, saying the mosque has historical and archaeological importance.\nThe New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has sought public opinion on the mosque’s proposed removal.\nIn a notice issued on Sunday, NDMC invited citizens’ objections and suggestions on the matter by January 1. The mosque, which stands on a roundabout in central Delhi, has been proposed to be removed on grounds of traffic snarls in the area.\nIn a letter to the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), Ali said that such a “drastic step is unwarranted”, given the “historical and archaeological importance” of the mosque.\nAli said the proposed removal could raise questions about the fairness of targeting a specific religious structure and undermine public confidence.\n“The proposed removal raises concerns about the fairness of the process, especially considering the contribution of the Muslim community to nation-building and the ethos of India,” Ali said in his letter.\nThe Delhi Waqf Board had previously approached the Delhi High Court expressing concerns about the potential demolition of the mosque during a joint survey, Ali said.\nThe court proceedings related to the Delhi Waqf Board were closed on December 18, with “the Additional Solicitor General stating that the apprehension for demolition had no basis”, the MP said.\n“The issuance of the notice right after the High Court closed for vacation raises doubts about the fairness of the process,” he added.\nThe Sunehri Bagh Masjid is among 123 properties in Delhi claimed by the waqf board that are part of a pending Delhi High Court case, according to the MP.\nHe stressed that assurances were given in court that no proposals for steps beyond the inspection of such properties were given.\nAli also said that the HCC, established for the conservation and protection of heritage sites, should not be involved in facilitating their removal.\n“The proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid goes against the very purpose of the committee,” he said.\nThe Amroha MP also questioned the necessity of removing the mosque saying there were no significant traffic congestion issues around the Sunehri Masjid roundabout.\nAli requested the HCC to reconsider its notice and refrain from granting approval for the removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid.\n“In today’s technologically advanced era, alternative methods for traffic management that do not involve the removal of a historical and religious structure can and should be explored by the Delhi Traffic Police,” he said.",
