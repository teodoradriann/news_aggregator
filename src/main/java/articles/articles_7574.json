    "text": "En este mundo tan crispado y polarizado , hay quienes se consideran legitimados para burlarse gratuitamente de los símbolos cristianos , con el aplauso de alguna gente. Ante estas provocaciones, otros sienten la obligación de «defender la fe» , pero utilizan insultos y descalifican a los que no se pronuncian con su misma contundencia. Unos y otros, aunque están en trincheras opuestas, se asemejan más de lo que parece, ya que legitiman la violencia verbal y el ataque personal.\nAnte estas acciones y reacciones, los cristianos hemos de hacer un esfuerzo para defender la fe no de cualquier manera, sino al estilo de Jesús. Recordemos que Él proclamó: «Habéis oído que se dijo: “Amarás a tu prójimo” y aborrecerás a tu enemigo. Pero yo os digo: Amad a vuestros enemigos y rezad por los que os persiguen , para que seáis hijos de vuestro Padre celestial, que hace salir su sol sobre malos y buenos» (cf. Mt 5, 43-45).\nJesús nos pide que recemos por quienes nos persiguen. La oración, aunque a veces pueda parecer inútil, es el medio más eficaz para purificar nuestras intenciones, para actuar y hablar movidos por el amor y no por la rabia (cf. Mt 5, 22). Sólo así seremos capaces de vencer el mal con el bien (cf. Rm 12, 21) y de transparentar el amor del Padre celestial que ama a todas las personas.\nEl encuentro con el Señor nos permite defender la fe con la humildad de quien se sabe pecador, sin despreciar a los que no comparten nuestro credo (cf. Lc 18, 9-14). La oración nos ayuda a discernir cuándo tenemos que responder con argumentos y cuándo es mejor reaccionar con el silencio, siguiendo el ejemplo de Jesús, que no siempre respondió con palabras a algunas acusaciones (Cf. Lc 23, 9; Jn 19, 9).\nEn la oración caemos en la cuenta de que defender los signos más sagrados de nuestra fe pasa necesariamente por la solidaridad con las personas que sufren cualquier tipo de violencia, injusticia o abuso; pues «si queréis honrar el cuerpo de Cristo, no lo despreciéis cuando está desnudo; no honréis al Cristo eucarístico con ornamentos de seda, mientras que fuera del templo descuidáis a ese otro Cristo que sufre por frío y desnudez» (san Juan Crisóstomo).\nLa oración nos ayuda a distinguir cuando somos atacados por ser fieles a la verdad y al Evangelio y cuando lo somos por nuestros errores. Y, por último, la relación con Dios nos anima a sentirnos dichosos cuando nos insulten, nos persigan y nos calumnien de cualquier modo por causa de Jesús, porque tenemos ocasión para dar testimonio del amor de Dios y nuestra recompensa será grande en el cielo (cf. Mt 5, 11-12; Lc 21, 13).\nAunque este camino pueda parecer poco eficaz, el Evangelio siempre es el medio más seguro para defender la fe en el Dios del Amor, manifestado en Cristo muerto y resucitado. Recibid un saludo muy cordial en el Señor.",

They then “just sorted from the largest to the smallest and downloaded them”.\nIntCyberDigest then revealed that the data appeared not to come from Tesla but instead from a firm called Numocity, a manufacturer of EV charging software, middleware, smart charges and more.\nNumocity has yet to publicly acknowledge the incident, as has Tesla or its CEO, Elon Musk.\nLast year, Tesla blamed two former employees for a [data breach that affected 75,000 of its staff](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/9459-tesla-blames-two-former-staff-for-data-breach-affecting-75k).\nIn a notice filed with the Maine Attorney-General on 18 August 2023 and issued to Tesla staff, the company announced that two ex-employees were to blame for the data breach that occurred in May, resulting in the personal information of 75,735 individuals being compromised.\nThe breach was first outed by Handelsblatt, a German publication, which announced that 100 gigabytes worth of data had been stolen and leaked by a “disgruntled former employee” who utilised their position as a service technician to access the data.\nHandelsblatt told Tesla that the data included identifiable information, including names, addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers. This data included Elon Musk’s own social security number, according to the publication.\nOther data included private email addresses, employees’ salaries, customer bank details and confidential information regarding Tesla production.",

    "title": "OBE for Westminster Bridge attack survivor who was inspired to combat hate",
    "text": "More support is needed to help victims of terror incidents, according to a survivor of the Westminster Bridge attack who has been made an OBE for his work to combat radicalism. Travis Frain was hit by a car driven by Khalid Masood on London’s Westminster Bridge in March 2017. Mr Frain, 25, of Darwen, Lancashire – who says “not a day goes by when I do not think about it (the attack)” – has been honoured for services to counter-extremism and to victims of terrorism. “My only hope is that with this honour I am able to continue to drive home that message to get changes that are needed.” Masood, a British-born convert to Islam, drove along a pavement on Westminster Bridge, killing four pedestrians, and then stabbed a police officer to death outside Parliament. The attacker was shot dead at the scene. Lives were torn apart by “82 seconds of high and terrible drama” in the attack, an inquest into the deaths was told. Mr Frain told the PA news agency: “If I am going to think about the incident – and I will remember it for many, many years to come – I want to be able to look back with not just the negativity of what happened that day and the impact it had on me and my family. This has included campaigning for the rights of terror victims to improved support from the state while also trying to prevent future attacks. Mr Frain campaigned for a plaque to be installed on Westminster Bridge in memory of those affected, goes into schools and colleges to share his experience and has run educational workshops. He created the Resilience in Unity Project in 2021, which records the testimonies of people affected by terror attacks in a bid to prevent people being radicalised. He is also a member of the advisory boards of Counter Terrorism Policing and charities including the National Emergencies Trust. Mr Frain was a politics and history student on a trip Whitehall when he was stuck by the car driven by Masood. “I went over the bonnet and hit the windshield. I was thrown into the air before landing back down on the concrete,” he said. His left leg was fractured in two places and metal and glass from the car caused a deep laceration in his leg, missing an artery by about an inch. All four fingers on his left hand were broken and he had a range of cuts, bruises and other minor injuries across his body. He spent eight days in hospital and had two operations, and one of his visitors was the King, who was then the Prince of Wales. Mr Frain said: “I spent about six months on crutches, followed by having to use a walking stick and then had about two years of physiotherapy. “I just felt that what I had experienced had changed my mindset and made me realise there was a lot of work that needs to be done in this area to try and counter extremism and try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future. “I figured that if there was something, however small, I could do to contribute then I absolutely should do it once I was back in full working order.” Mr Frain described himself as “immensely proud and humbled” by the OBE which he hopes may “shine a light” on the dedication of thousands of people around the country trying to counter violence and extremism. He said: “At the end of the day we are all trying to prevent future terror attacks. There are a lot of people out there who may not have a story like mine but may be working behind the scenes and will never get recognition. “We had a lot of attacks in this country in 2017, the year I became a victim of terrorism. “We often hear that lessons will be learned. You would hope those lessons are being learned but I think it is still important that we bang the drum about why changes and improvement are necessary. “Since the pandemic young people are increasingly being exposed to extremist content, often online but also since coming out of the lockdowns. “I think it is really concerning, not just the speed but also the scale of the radicalisation.”",

    "title": "Reporter lashes out after blowback for claiming 'Christian nationalists' believe rights 'come from God' | Fox News",
    "text": "A reporter for Politico is firing back at critics she says are taking her out of context based on comments she made bashing \\\"Christian nationalists.\\\" Appearing on MSNBC Thursday, Politico national investigative correspondent Heidi Przybyla was asked about the \\\"infusion of Christian nationalism\\\" in Congress following the appointment of Louisiana representative and devout Christian Mike Johnson as House Speaker. \\\"The base of the Republican Party has shifted, right?\\\" Przybyla began. \\\"Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainline evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced, you know, real estate mogul who had cheated on his wife with a porn star and all of that. So what happened was he was surrounded by this more extremist element. They're gonna hear words like ‘Christian nationalism,' like the ‘New Apostolic reformation.’ These are groups that you should get very, very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trump's circle.\\\" CNN REPORTER ASKS BIDEN IF NAVALNY'S BLOOD IS ‘ON THE HANDS OF REPUBLICANS’ FOR BLOCKING UKRAINE AID \\\"The thing that unites them as Christian nationalists - not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different - is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don't come from any earthly authority. They don't come from Congress, they don't come from the Supreme Court. They come from God. The problem with that is that they are determining- man, men, it is men are determining what God is telling them,\\\" Przybyla said. \\\"And in the past, that so-called natural law is, you know, it's a pillar of Catholicism, for instance. It has been used for good in social justice campaigns, Martin Luther King evoked it in talking about civil rights, but now you have an extremist element of conservative Christians who say that this applies specifically to issues including abortion, gay marriage, and it's going much further than that,\\\" she continued, before citing the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF. A portion of Przybyla's comments, especially the ones talking about how Christian nationalists believe rights come from God not government, went viral on Friday with many critics accusing her of attacking Christians and being ignorant of basic American civics. The Declaration of Independence cites \\\"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\\\" and says, \\\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\\" JAMES CARVILLE: ‘CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS’ LIKE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON ARE A ‘BIGGER THREAT THAN AL-QAEDA’ \\\"Here @MSNBC helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America,\\\" Wade Miller of Citizens for Renewing America said while sharing the clip of Przybyla. \\\"She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this proclamation, as have most Americans throughout our history. The radical Atheist Globalists are coming to try to crush ordinary American citizens.\\\" \\\"Our Declaration of Independence, our entire system of government, is based on the principle that our rights don’t come from some 'earthly authority' (like Congress or a king) but from God. Read the plain words of the Declaration: ‘We are endowed by our CREATOR with certain inalienable rights.’ The historical illiteracy of her comments is stunning,\\\" Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen added. \\\"Imagine going on TV and being this ignorant while having this level of self assurance,\\\" New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz reacted. \\\"Liberal privilege, man. We hold these truths to be self-evident but only if Congress and the Supreme Court agree!\\\" MSNBC'S MATTHEW DOWD: ‘WHITE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM’ ENGULFED REPUBLICAN PARTY POLITICS AND RELIGION \\\"Has @HeidiReports read the Declaration of Independence?\\\" Daily Caller deputy editor Ailan Evans asked. But Przybyla remained defiant on Friday. \\\"That is NOT what I said & you know it. Why don't you play the full clip?\\\" Przybyla reacted to Miller's viral post of her comments. \\\"I said men are making their own policy interpretation of natural law. MLK did so w social justice. You're welcome to as well but you don't speak for all Christians & certainly not for God.\\\" She later added, \\\"While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God. If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda… which distinguishes this from other Christians who leave these God-given rights at our inherent right to ‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ -- vs banning abortion, contraception etc.\\\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to Fox News Digital's request for comment, Przybyla pointed to the full clip of her remarks and did not comment further. Politico did not immediately respond for comment. Earlier in the week, Przybyla co-authored a report claiming that top allies of former President Trump are ready to \\\"infuse\\\" Christian nationalism into a second administration if he's elected, spearheaded by his former White House budget director and current president of the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America Russell Vought.",

    "text": "¡Serios problemas para la Selección Colombia femenina en los Juegos Olímpicos ! Este jueves 25 de julio, las dirigidas por Ángelo Marsiglia cayeron 2-3 ante la anfitriona Francia , en duelo válido por la primera jornada del Grupo A. Resultado que complica seriamente su clasificación a la siguiente ronda del certamen.\nFue un partido de menos a más para las colombianas, quienes se fueron goleadas al descanso por 0-3 , gracias a las anotaciones de Marie Katoto por duplicado y Kenza Dali ; ahora bien, la reacción en el complemento no se hizo esperar y tanto Manuela Pavi como Catalina Usme levantaron la ilusión.\nSi bien el elenco tricolor intentó llegar a la igualdad hasta más no poder, sobre los 85 minutos todo se derrumbó, cuando Mayra Ramírez cometió una imprudente infracción contra Selma Bacha . Si bien no parecía una situación de gravedad, desde el VAR llamaron a la juez central para que revisara la acción. Allí quedó en evidencia el fortísimo pisotón, a la altura del tobillo, de la nacida en Cundinamarca contra la francesa.\nLe puede interesar:\nCamila Osorio tendrá difícil rival para su debut en los Juegos Olímpicos París 2024 Liga de Colombia: los equipos que según las estadísticas clasificarán a los cuadrangulares Como era de esperarse, la decisión fue anular el cartón amarilla para mostrar la roja directa . Así pues, con una jugadora menos sobre el campo de juego, la esperanza colombiana de emparejar la historia se esfumó.\nCon la victoria de Canadá sobre Nueva Zelanda , los otros dos rivales del Grupo A, la Selección Colombia tendrá que ganar lo que le resta de la fase de grupos (sumar seis puntos) para tener posibilidades de avanzar a la ronda final.\n¿Cuántos partidos se pierde Mayra Ramírez? Según el reglamento de la competición, las expulsiones en el fútbol olímpico , bien sea por doble amonestación o roja directa (caso de Mayra), corresponden a una fecha de sanción. Es decir, que la colombiana se perderá el duelo del próximo domingo ante Nueva Zelanda y regresaría para el cierre ante las canadienses.\n“ Si un jugador o miembro del cuerpo técnico es expulsado como resultado de una tarjeta roja directa o por doble amonestación, se le impondrá una suspensión de manera automática y no podrá participar en el siguiente partido de su selección ”, dice el reglamento.",

    "text": "El Tiempo en Valencia La Aemet mantiene la alerta amarilla y prevé lluvias hasta el próximo lunes El riesgo se concentra en Castellón donde serán «localmente fuertes», pero podrían extenderse al litoral de Valencia La inestabilidad meteorológica se mantendrá, al menos, hasta el domingo en la [Comunitat Valenciana](/comunitat-valenciana/) según las previsiones de la [Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet)](/tags/agencia-estatal-de-meteorologia-aemet/), aunque las[ lluvias](/tags/lluvias/) serán de menor intensidad a las registradas el martes en la provincia de Valencia y el jueves en la de Castellón, que provocaron inundaciones en varios puntos. La agencia mantiene la alerta amarilla en la provincia de Castellón durante todo este sábado; la [rebaja respecto al nivel naranja de ayer](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/01/emergencias-rebaja-amarillo-alerta-lluvias- 4394.html). Allí se esperan «chubascos y tormentas localmente y persistentes»; principalmente, en las comarcas más septentrionales. Es donde más llovió el jueves; en Tírig cayeron más de 210 litros. La alerta estará, también, activa en las de Alicante y Valencia durante las primeras horas de este sábado; se activó ayer a partir de las siete de la tarde. En algunos puntos del litoral de Valencia y el norte de Alicante, no se descartan que puedan generarse precipitaciones importantes. Domingo y lunes El riesgo se mantendrá activo en Castellón hasta el mediodía del domingo. Durante toda la jornada dominical, hay posibilidades de que se produzcan chubascos «localmente fuertes y persistentes» en Castellón y Valencia; unos episodios mucho más débiles y dispersos en la provincia de Alicante. Las previsiones incluyen posibles precipitaciones para el lunes durante la primera mitad de la jornada con posibilidad de «chubascos ocasionalmente acompañados de tormentas». Según la Aemet, estas «tenderán a remitir» al final del día. Temperaturas estables En cuanto a las [temperaturas](/tags/temperaturas/), se prevé cierta estabilidad con valores muy similares a los de la jornada de ayer. Las máximas se moverán en torno a los 20 grados tanto en la costa como en el interior. Las mínimas registrarán más diferencias porque será de unos 18 grados en el litoral y seis grados por debajo en las comarcas interiores, con valores de entre 12 y 13 grados.
