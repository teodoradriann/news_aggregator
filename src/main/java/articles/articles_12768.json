    "text": "Basil Zempilas has hit out at east coast fans again He believes day/night Test should go to Perth Perth mayor is unhappy with criticism of his city\nBasil Zempilas has doubled down on his criticism of the MCG crowd as the Perth mayor called for the day/night Test to be given to the west coast.\nZempilas caused a stir on Boxing Day when he took aim at the 62,000 fans who attended the opening day of the Test at the 100,000-seat stadium.\nThe Perth mayor fiercely defended his city when just under 60,000 fans went to Optus Stadium over four days of cricket in Australia’s first Test win over Pakistan.\nReflecting on the MCG crowd, he tweeted: ‘Hmmmm. What’s their excuse? Not like you can go to the beach?’\nUnsurprisingly, his comment was met with a lot of criticism, with fans labelling it ’embarrassing’.\nBasil Zempilas has once again hit out at the Boxing Day Test attendance at the MCG\nHe took to Twitter to aim a dig at the Melbourne fans on Boxing Day\nHowever, he has refused to budge on his stance, now claiming that the day/night Test is better located in Perth.\n‘Bugger the Vics I say. Bugger the rest of them as well,’ he told 6PR Radio.\n‘All of this came out of a bit of tongue-in-cheek fun at the Victorians for all going home when it started raining. And I looked up at the MCG, virtually empty and said, ‘what’s their excuse? It’s not as if they can go to the beach.\n‘That was of course relating to our own crowds at our own Test match. Yes, the Vics did have more on one day, the opening day of the Boxing Day Test than we had for our entire Test match, but then again … if our Test match started on Boxing Day, a public holiday, I reckon we’d get a fair crowd as well.’\nTo further back his point, Zempilas singled out the Boxing Day crowd at Optus Stadium for the Scorchers’ Big Bash League game, with over 40,000 in attendance.\nHe said that the strong turnout proves Perth’s appetite for late-night cricket and that the day/night Test should be moved from the Gabba to the west coast.\nLogistically, however, a day/night Test in Perth may be a tough sell, as it would mean play would finish at around midnight on the east coast.\nZempilas was criticised but he has doubled down on his controversial stance\nHe has called for the day/night Test to come to Perth and says there is appetite for it\nBut a defiant Zempilas says: ‘Bugger what they say on the east coast!\n‘Haven’t we had enough about being dictated to! In all seriousness, it’s the holiday time of the year, kids can stay up later.\n‘I accept that you want as many young people around the nation following our national cricket team, but it is that time of the year when kids can stay up,’ he said.\n‘Don’t we all do it when the Ashes are on? Don’t we do it when there’s big football matches overseas? We do stay up and it becomes a part of the fun and the culture of it.’",

    "text": "LAHORE: A team of the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) has unearthed a factory producing substandard confectioneries with prohibited ingredients here on Thursday. The raid was conducted in the area of Bund Road, Akram Park, under the supervision of PFA Director General Muhammad Asim Javed. On this occasion, he said that the authority closed down the factory over violations and discarded a huge cache of hazardous food, including 35,000 substandard toffees, inferior-quality of chocolates, 500kg of whey powder, 450kg of coco powder, 200 litres of chocolate syrup, 150 litres of palm oil and five bags of prohibited colour. “The local area police have registered a case against the factory owner on the complaint of PFA while handing two accused over to police for further investigation,” he added. He further said that chocolates and toffees were being made with expired coco powder and palm oil and they also witnessed worst condition of hygiene and rusty machinery during the raid. Apart from that, workers of the unit did not have medical and training certificates, he added. Javed said that the authority took action against the factory for doing the food business against the Punjab Pure Food Regulations, adding that the use of substandard and prohibited ingredients in the preparation of any edibles cause health problems for consumers. He further said that the authority is taking all measures to ensure the effective implementation of law and polices in Punjab; the PFA is fully committed to ensuring a zero-tolerance policy against adulterators and counterfeiting in Punjab. The authority will make Punjab’s land narrow for adulteration mafia by rooting out their ‘dens’ and unlawful businesses, he added.

Flawed, of course, but it was ours, not a closed platform.\nActually, it was not \"yours\". It belongs to the Python Software Foundation, that is acting in accordance with its founding principles. They decided (after a very public deliberation and feedback) that the supply chain security is more important than ideological purity as advocated by a minority of users.\nPosted Nov 15, 2024 5:07 UTC (Fri)\nby bignose (subscriber, #40)\n[\nI'll take that as confirmation that no, there is no such thing today.

And no evident plan to fix that, not then and not now.\nThe absence of a new solution is not the PSF's fault nor responsibility. The *removal of the existing system*, while there was and is no equivalent community-controlled replacement, is their responsibility and is the issue I'm glad to see we agree is true.\n> Actually, it was not \"yours\".

Now, thanks to the China-Vietnam Railway Express, which operates daily from Nanning International Railway Port, fresh produce reaches consumers much faster than ever before. Li Wenzi from the Communication University of China explores this massive logistics hub in southern China's Guangxi, which has become the heartbeat of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor. Every day, tens of thousands of cargo-loaded containers converge here, connecting China with ASEAN member countries. The port handles 366 categories of goods via the China-Vietnam Railway Express and 1,160 product types across the entire corridor. By 2025, the corridor's freight rail services will have completed over 300,000 trips, with container volume surpassing 960,000 TEUs. This deeply integrated cross-border supply chain provides southern China with a fast route to the sea, while steadily bringing ASEAN goods into Chinese homes. More than just a trade hub, this port serves as a key component of the Belt and Road Initiative and China's dual circulation development pattern, forging closer ties among China, ASEAN and the world.\n(Li Wenzi, Yuan Ziyan, Zhang Shenmao, Wang Hong, Zhou Xun, Xiao Yinuo contribute to the story.)\nCHOOSE YOUR LANGUAGE\nDOWNLOAD OUR APP\n互联网新闻信息许可证10120180008\nDisinformation report hotline: 010-85061466",
