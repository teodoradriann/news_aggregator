    "text": "EDMONTON — Warren Foegele had two goals, Leon Draisaitl had a goal and three assists, and the Edmonton Oilers rebounded from another tough start to defeat the Seattle Kraken 4-2 on Thursday and extend their winning streak to a franchise-record 12 games.\nZach Hyman also scored for the Oilers (25-15-1), who have gone 20-3-0 in their last 23 games. Edmonton tied the record for the longest win streak by a Canadian team set by the 1967-68 Montreal Canadiens.\nEeli Tolvanen and Jared McCann replied for the Kraken (19-17-9), who lost their third in a row during the tail end of a six-game road trip after managing a nine-game winning streak.\nSeattle started the scoring midway through the opening period as Oliver Bjorkstrand sprang Tolvanen with a long breakaway pass. The Finnish forward beat Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner high to the glove side for his 12th of the season. It was the fifth straight game Edmonton allowed the game’s first goal.\nThe Kraken went up 2-0 a few minutes later when McCann picked the top corner for his 18th after a giveaway by Evander Kane created a two-on-one.\nEdmonton finally woke up to start the second period with a goal coming just 37 seconds in. A big rebound on a Draisaitl shot fell to Foegele on the other side and he scored his eighth before Seattle goalie Joey Daccord could get across.\nThe Oilers drew even on the power play 4:38 into the middle frame as Draisaitl banked his 22nd of the campaign off of Daccord and in. It was Draisaitl’s 10th goal in his last 13 games.\nEdmonton kept its foot on the gas with a third goal in a seven-minute span as a backhand pass from Draisaitl sent Foegele in all alone and he scored his second of the game stick-side.\nIt looked like Seattle had tied it up late in the second period on a goal by Alex Wennberg, but officials determined via video review that a teammate was offside whilst making a change.\nThe Oilers put the game away with 2:38 remaining while Yanni Gourde served a five-minute major for charging as Connor McDavid sent a pretty backhand across the crease to give Hyman an easy power play tap-in for his 27th of the year. The assist extended McDavid’s point streak to 12 games.\nEdmonton tied its franchise record with 10 consecutive games allowing two or fewer goals.\nNOTES\nIt was the third of four meetings between the two teams, with Edmonton having won the previous two… Oilers forward Sam Gagner returned to the lineup after missing the last 10 games with an injury. Fellow forward Kane was able to remain in despite reports that he would be a game-time decision with a hand problem… Kane would end up recording his 600th career point… Seattle has been bit with the injury bug of late, without the services of Vince Dunn (undisclosed) and Matty Beniers (undisclosed). However, forward Andre Burakovsky was able to return from a lower-body injury… Daccord started after sitting out for the first time in eight games… Oilers defender Darnell Nurse played in his 600th career NHL game… Edmonton came into the game having allowed only 19 combined goals during their previous 11 games, six of those coming during the first two games of the streak. The Oilers allowed 50 goals in their first 12 games during their tough start to the season.\nUP NEXT\nKraken: Return home to begin a four-game homestand against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday.\nOilers: Head to Calgary to face the rival Flames on Saturday.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 18, 2024.\nShane Jones, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Here's what happens if you don't layer network security – or remove unused web shells TL;DR: Attackers will break in and pwn you, as a US government red team demonstrated The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency often breaks into critical organizations' networks – with their permission, of course – to simulate real-world cyber attacks and thereby help improve their security. In one of those recent exercises conducted at a critical infrastructure provider, the Agency exploited a web shell left behind from an earlier bug bounty program, scooped up a bunch of credentials and security keys, moved through the network and ultimately pwned the org's domain and several sensitive business system targets. In a Thursday blog post, the Agency (CISA) detailed the exercise and opined they \"illuminate lessons learned for network defenders and software manufacturers about how to respond to and reduce risk.\" In other words: give it a read and learn from this critical infrastructure organization's mistakes – and the things it did well – to keep real criminals out of your IT environment. The CISA red team conducted the operation over a three-month period, we're told. It went in blind, with no prior knowledge about the organization's technology assets. After doing some open source research on the target to learn more about its networks, defensive tools and employees, CISA targeted 13 employees with a spear phishing campaign – all picked as most likely to communicate with people outside the organization. One of the employees responded and eventually ran two malicious payloads – but the malware didn't make it past security controls. CISA's red team continued probing for devices or services exposed to the interview by using publicly available tools like Shodan and Censys . Old, unpatched bug for the win … and initial access Ultimately, the hunters came across an \"old and unpatched service with a known XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.\" The team used a publicly known proof of concept to exploit this bug and deploy a web shell before discovering one already in place on the target organization's Linux web server. This red team used the shell to run commands on the server, find an exposed internal proxy server, and set up command and control (C2). After escalating privileges, CISA's operatives discovered that overly permissive access controls allowed them to run commands as root without a password. \"With root access to the web server, the team had full access to the organization's directories and files on a NFS share with no_root_squash enabled,\" thus allowing remote users to read and/or change any file on the shared system. The NFS share hosted home directories belonging to \"hundreds of Linux users\" – many of whom had privileged access to more servers. With the NFS share wide open, CISA's team then snooped around for secrets: private certificate files, Secure Shell (SSH) private keys, passwords, bash command histories, and other sensitive info. \"The team initially obtained 61 private SSH keys and a file containing valid cleartext domain credentials (DOMAINUSER1) that the team used to authenticate to the organization's domain,\" we're told. Red team hacker on how she 'breaks into buildings and pretends to be the bad guy' Move over, Cobalt Strike. Splinter's the new post-exploit menace in town AI red-teaming tools helped X-Force break into a major tech manufacturer 'in 8 hours' Orgs are having a major identity crisis while crims reap the rewards One week after initially breaking into the org, the red team attackers had established persistent access on four Linux servers, using a different persistence mechanism on each one to make it harder for network defenders to discover the intruders. The team also gained root access to an infrastructure management server that ran Ansible Tower and which CISA described as \"adjacent\" to \"sensitive business systems.\" From there the tame attackers moved on to six more such systems across six IP ranges. Odd behavior from a root SSH private key – which was being used to log into multiple hosts and at times and durations outside of the baseline usage – alerted the target org to the fact that it had been pwned, CISA noted. \"In a real compromise, the organization would have had to shut down the server, significantly impacting business operations,\" it warned. The red team also compromised a Windows domain controller, which allowed it to steal credentials and move laterally to all domain-connected Windows hosts in the org. And after compromising both Linux and Windows systems across the critical facility's networks and establishing persistent access, CISA’s attackers got to work on post-exploit activities: accessing more sensitive business systems including admin workstations. \"The red team maintained access to these systems for several weeks,\" the blog states. Next, it targeted corporate workstations belonging to the administrators and operators of the victim org's critical infrastructure. Time constraints, however, prohibited the team from fully compromising these systems. Lessons learned The good news: \"they did not discover a way to compromise the underlying [operational technology] OT devices,\" CISA noted. In its extensive write-up about the exercise, CISA detailed how its red team evaded detection at each step in the attack. It also suggests what network defenders could have done to kick out the intruders and includes an entire section on ways to mitigate the findings for both defenders and software manufacturers – we'd definitely suggest giving the entire analysis a thorough read. But here are a few key lessons learned from the exercise. First, the target organization didn't have the right technical controls in place to detect and then stop intruders. \"The organization relied too heavily on host-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and did not implement sufficient network layer protections,\" CISA noted. Second, the victim org's staff – and any staff, really – require ongoing training and support to configure software properly and to detect malicious network activity. And this: leadership must prioritize known attack vectors that put their organization's business at risk of attack. \"Leadership deprioritized the treatment of a vulnerability their own cyber security team identified,\" the report reveals, \"and in their risk-based decision-making, miscalculated the potential impact and likelihood of its exploitation.\" ®",

    "text": "Reforma de la Ley de Extranjería La Generalitat de Cataluña coincide con Junts y rechaza la propuesta del Gobierno sobre el reparto de menores migrantes La solidaridad territorial va a tardar en llegar a Canarias, al menos en materia de migración. La Generalitat de Cataluña, de ERC, y también Junts, han anunciado que rechazan la propuesta que le ha hecho el Gobierno central [sobre el reparto de menores migrantes no acompañados ](https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/sociedad/19000-migrantes-han-llegado-canarias-que-ano-220-mas-que-mismo-periodo-ano-anterior_202406226676d14c888bcf00014818d0.html)que ahora mismo están en las islas Canarias. En un comunicado, el Govern ha asegurado que la propuesta planteada \"no da respuesta adecuada a las circunstancias en las que se encuentra\". En un comunicado, el Govern ha informado de que mantiene la interlocución con el Gobierno para que se introduzcan modificaciones en el texto propuesto de reforma de la Ley de Extranjería, para que se reconozca la singularidad de Cataluña en la acogida de los menores extranjeros llegados de Canarias, Ceuta, Melilla y otros territorios. También se reclama, \"tanto en su fondo como en la forma\", que se respeten las competencias catalanas en materia de infancia y se evite \"la imposición unilateral del Estado en el reparto de los menores\". Cataluña pide que se garantice un sistema de reparto \"justo y equilibrado\" con unos criterios claros y transparentes en los diferentes territorios y que el Estado asuma la financiación de estas acogidas que \"responda a las circunstancias reales que tiene Cataluña\". El Gobierno presentará su propuesta de reforma legal para establecer un reparto obligatorio de migrantes entre las comunidades autónomas en la próxima Conferencia Sectorial de Infancia y Adolescencia, que se celebrará en las próximas semanas en Canarias. El reparto de menores es clave para Canarias, allí, ahora mismo, hay unos 6.000 menores migrantes no acompañados. Las islas están desbordadas para poder atender a estos chicos. Pensemos que con el reparto que propone el Gobierno, Canarias debería quedarse con unos 2.000 menores, esa es la capacidad que tiene. Ahora mismo acoge al triple. El ministro de Política Territorial, Ángel Víctor Torres, ha querido trasladar a todas la comunidades la gravedad de la situación. \"Estamos hablando de 6.000 menores en un territorio de ocho islas y, por lo tanto, mucho más allá de lo que puede ser una cantidad que pueda absorber un territorio de dos millones de personas\", ha aclarado el ministro, que ha asegurado que se \"ha encaminado en una hoja de ruta que culminará en el mes de julio\". Lo cierto es que la ruta migratoria de Canarias ya es la más letal del mundo y por donde entran cientos de miles de migrantes en pocos meses. [En lo que llevamos de año, han muerto casi 5.000 personas](https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/sociedad/19000-migrantes-han-llegado-canarias-que-ano-220-mas-que-mismo-periodo-ano-anterior_202406226676d14c888bcf00014818d0.html) y todavía quedan los meses de verano, que es cuando se incrementan los viajes en pateras debido a la mejora de las condiciones del mar. Y es que en lo que va de 2024, casi 19.000 personas han llegado al archipiélago canario, lo que supone un 220% más que en el mismo periodo del año anterior.",
