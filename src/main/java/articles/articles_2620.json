    "title": "New Year’s Eve partygoers face weather chaos as wind and heavy rain to batter UK after Storm Gerrit",
    "text": "Partygoers celebrating New Year’s Eve are likely to face heavy rain and potential snow, as the UK continues to reel in the aftermath of Storm Gerrit. As millions ring in the start of 2024, people face damp fireworks displays as rain and wind batter the coastline areas and temperatures drop to near freezing. With midnight approaching, the Met Office said Scotland is likely to see icy conditions develop, while up to 25mm of rain is expected to batter Wales and Northern Ireland. Ahead of New Year’s Eve, a cold front is set to move east across England and Wales on Saturday, with a weather warning in place until 3am on Sunday morning as winds are expected to reach up to 75mph in places near the south-west coast. The warning, which is in place from 11am on 30 December until 3am the following day, is expected to bring delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport, with it likely that some coastal communities and sea fronts in south Wales and Cornwall will be affected by large waves. Some train services are likely to be impacted as well as short-term loss of power and delays for high-sided vehicles. It comes after Storm Gerrit left thousands of homes without power on Thursday, with a lightning strike impacting 36,000 properties in Wales and 1,500 homes in northern Scotland enduring two nights with no electricity. A “localised tornado” also tore through Greater Manchester on Wednesday evening, damaging 100 houses and tearing down trees. Speaking to The Independent , senior meteorologist Rachel Ayers said: “Rain that will spread northeastwards on Saturday will clear away from the Northern Isles with some very windy conditions here to start. “Elsewhere it will be a mixture of sunny spells and blustery showers that could band together at times. Some of these showers could be thundery with hail mixed in especially in the south/southwest. “A very windy day in the south/southwest too with gales or even severe gales along the south coast with strong gusts inland in and around showers. “Looking at the weather closer to midnight showers will become more isolated though could still band together and winds will generally start to ease though gale force winds are still possible for western and southern coasts. There is also a risk of ice developing overnight for some higher roads in Scotland.” Temperatures are expected to drop to near freezing, reaching just 1C in the Scottish Highlands and 3C in Edinburgh. Andy Page, a forecaster for the Met Office, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm, while up to 25mm of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.” Meanwhile, train operators have encouraged revellers to travel as early as Friday to avoid disappointment with rail cancellations in the wake of the bad weather and staff shortages. Passengers due to travel on Northern Rail have been told that tickets booked for Sunday are valid from Friday and have been warned to “expect disruption” on New Year’s Eve. Other railway services such as Chiltern Railways, which operates from London Marylebone, and CrossCountry, which operates throughout the UK, have warned of last minute cancellations. With unsettled conditions due to continue impacting the UK post-Storm Gerrit, people have been encouraged to check the forecast before travelling and to avoid driving through flood water. This comes as three men were killed after their 4x4 became submerged in the River Esk on Thursday. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency is monitoring closely and has teams out on the ground undertaking preparatory activity to minimise the impacts of flooding where possible. “At this time of year, with people out walking over the festive and New Year period, it’s particularly important to take care near riverbanks. If you are planning on travelling, please check the weather conditions ahead of your journey, and we urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.” Looking ahead into 2024, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster Nick Silkstone said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”",

    "text": " The review included 11 trials and more than 6,000 patients. Improvements included symptoms, sleep, emotions, problems and activities. Scores remained significant after accounting for age and sex. Sublingual immunotherapy tablets improved quality of life for patients with allergic rhinitis with and without conjunctivitis, according to a review published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice .\nTreatments included tablets for grass, tree, ragweed and house dust mite, Michael S. Blaiss, MD, clinical professor of pediatrics, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, and colleagues wrote.\nData were derived from Blaiss MS, et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract . 2022;doi:10.1016/j.jaip.2024.01.038. “The efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets is well documented in the literature, but does the patient truly show benefit with this treatment in their quality of life?” Blaiss, who also is a member of the Healio Allergy and Asthma Peer Perspective Board, told Healio.\nMichael S. Blaiss The researchers analyzed Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) responses from 11 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted between 2002 and 2017 that included approximately 6,000 adults as well as 323 adolescents and 109 children.\nGenerally, patients were classified as in their mid-30s in terms of age with disease durations between 9.9 and 21 years. Also, 75% of these patients were polysensitized.\nThese trials included five focused on grass (n = 3,179), two that studied ragweed (n = 767), one trial investigating tree allergy (n = 634) and three trials involving house dust mites (n = 2,221).\nAll 11 trials indicated improvements in overall RQLQ with SLIT , with 10 of them indicating statistically significant differences between SLIT tablets and placebo.\nPooled analyses of all 11 trials indicated highly significant improvements in overall RQLQ with SLIT tablets compared with placebo, the authors said, including –0.2 (95% CI, –0.28 to –0.12) for grass, –0.28 (95% CI, –0.39 to –0.17) for house dust mite, –0.36 (95% CI, –0.55 to –0.17) for ragweed and –0.42 (95% CI, –0.58 to –0.26) for tree.\nThe magnitude of these improvements in overall RQLQ results is comparable with improvements reported for other SLIT tablets, the authors wrote.\nThe authors also categorized the overall RQLQ results as consistent with pooled analyses across the seven domains in the questionnaire for all four allergens, significantly favoring active treatment.\n“The most surprising and significant results were that all the domains of the RQLQ were significant: activities limitation, sleep problems, nose symptoms, eye symptoms, non-nasal-eye symptoms, practical problems and emotional function,” Blaiss said. “This points to the high value of SLIT tablets for appropriate allergic rhinitis patients.”\nSpecifically, P values by domain for grass treatment included less than .001 for nasal, ocular, emotional, practical problems and activities alike, as well as .004 for non-nose/eye and .009 for sleep.\nFor ragweed treatment, P values by domain included .002 for nasal; less than .001 for ocular, non-nose/eye, sleep and activities; less than .001 for emotional, and .003 for practical problems.\nP values for tree treatment and house dust mite treatment both included less than .001 for all seven domains.\n“To me, the most surprising [finding] is that all domains of the RQLQ showed significant improvement, especially sleep problems and emotional function with SLIT tablets,” Blaiss said. “These two domains contribute much of the underlying misery that encompasses allergic rhinitis in our patients.”\nOverall RQLQ scores remained significant with little variation in sensitivity analyses based on age and sex as well, the authors said.\nThe authors further noted that these significant improvements were seen among patients who had free access to antihistamines and oral and nasal glucocorticosteroids that relieved symptoms during the trial period.\nPrevious research has found that these medications can improve quality of life based on RQLQ results, the authors wrote, indicating that the significant improvements found in this review were “compelling” as patients experienced a reduced need for symptom-relieving medication with SLIT.\n“As we know, many of our patients with allergic rhinitis do not get the relief that they need with medications, have side effects with medication, or are just tired of having to take medications,” Blaiss said. “This study shows us that SLIT tablets don’t only improve clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis but truly demonstrate improvement of quality of life in those patients.”\nConsidering the positive impact on sleep in particular, with potential improvements in productivity, the authors said that they are not surprised that SLIT tablets are considered an effective and socioeconomically attractive option for allergic rhinitis.\nBased on these findings, the authors concluded that SLIT tablets can be used more frequently to ease symptom burdens and improve quality of life for patients with allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis.\n“Patients with allergic rhinitis need to be made aware of this therapy, which can have important major benefits for their condition,” Blaiss said.\nFor more information: Michael S.

    "text": "One of the rare ‘ [Alfa Romeo](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/alfa-romeo/) Racing’ variants of the potent Giulia Quadrifoglio is heading to auction on January 31 and if pre-auction estimates prove to be accurate, it will sell for between €70,000 (~$76,000) and €90,000 (~$98,000). While [the Giulia Quadrifoglio](https://www.carscoops.com/2023/12/dealer-mechanic-crashes-alfa-giulia-qv-onto-porsche-911-into-mercedes-during-test-drive/) has never sold in the same numbers as the likes of the [BMW](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/BMW/) M3 and Mercedes-AMG C 63, it remains a very impressive high-performance sports sedan and of all the versions introduced, the Alfa Romeo Racing model is one of the most eye-catching. Sure, it is no GTAm, but it is significantly rarer. [The car](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/alfa-romeo-giulia/) was introduced to celebrate Alfa Romeo’s return to the Formula 1 grid and capped at just 10 units worldwide. Alfa Romeo also built 10 examples of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio in the same configuration. This car, like all others, has a white and red paint scheme similar to the C38 that competed during the 2019 F1 season. The hood of the limited-run model is particularly dramatic with bright red racing stripes, blue accents, and a large Alfa Romeo logo in the center. advertisement scroll to continue Read: [Alfa Romeo Giulia And Stelvio QV Racing Editions Reflect Bond With F1](https://www.carscoops.com/2019/03/alfa-romeo-giulia-and-stelvio-qv-racing-editions-reflect-bond-with-f1/) [](https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Quadrifoglio-15.jpg) Alfa Romeo also went to the trouble of equipping the car with a handful of carbon fiber accessories, including canards on the front bumper and carbon fiber elements on the rocker panels. There is also a carbon fiber lip spoiler at the rear. Various performance upgrades were also made to the car. The most obvious is the fitment of an Akrapovic titanium exhaust system but there are also carbon-ceramic brakes and tweaks made to the 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 so it now delivers 512 hp, a 10 hp gain over the regular Giulia Quadrifoglio. It also weighs 28 kg (61 lbs) less, not that drivers will notice the difference. [RM Sotheby’s](https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/PA24/Paris/lots/r0056-2020-Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Quadrifoglio-Alfa-Romeo-Racing-Edition/) notes that this example has been driven 5,990 km (3,722 miles) since new.",
