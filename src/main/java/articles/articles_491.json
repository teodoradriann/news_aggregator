    "title": "5 extra minutes of exercise may help lower blood pressure, study says",
    "text": "Just five more minutes of exercise doesn’t sound so bad, right? Especially when such a small amount may improve your blood pressure , according to a new study.\n“Incorporating even a few minutes of higher-intensity physical activities like brisk walking or cycling into daily routines can make a difference for (blood pressure) levels,” said lead study author Dr. Jo Blodgett, senior research fellow at the Institute of Sport, Exercise & Health at University College London.\nResearchers analyzed data from nearly 15,000 people who wore activity monitors and had their blood pressure tracked, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Circulation.\nThe day’s activities were broken down into six categories: sleep, sedentary behavior, slow walking, fast walking, standing, and more vigorous exercise, according to the study. Researchers used the data to estimate the impact of replacing sedentary time with the other activities.\nAs little as five more minutes a day of exercise was associated with lower blood pressure, and just 10 to 20 minutes more as linked to a clinically meaningful change in blood pressure (defined as a reduction of 2mmHg of systolic blood pressure or 1mmHg of diastolic blood pressure), Blodgett said.\nClinically meaningful changes in blood pressure can mean reduced risk for heart disease and stroke, said Dr. Susan Cheng, professor and vice chair of research in the department of cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was not involved in the research.\n“The study offers some very detailed information on the fact that even though most of us (are) relatively inactive for most of the day, even small changes can make a big difference,” she said in an email.\nToo much sitting around Decades of previous studies have shown that more physical activity is associated with more optimal blood pressure levels, Cheng said.\nThe latest study stands out in its observation of people’s everyday lives, rather than putting them through a prescribed exercise program, said study coauthor Dr. Mark Hamer, professor of sport and exercise medicine at the Institute of Sport, Exercise & Health at University College London.\n“The difficulty with these types of studies is that although they work to reduce (blood pressure), when people finish the programme they usually revert back to their sedentary habits,” he added in an email.\nAnd this study’s data showed that people are highly sedentary, Cheng said.\n“The data show that the average middle-aged adult is sedentary for about 11 hours per day, spending on average 3 hours standing, 1-2 hours walking slowly, and about an hour walking fast — but importantly spending on average about 15-16 minutes doing any kind of exercise like activity,” she said via email.\n“It’s important for us to recognize that this pretty consistent picture of relative inactivity is one that can be seen well across the population at large.”\nMore than just a walk in the park The study is observational, meaning that it can show associations but can’t say for sure that the increased activity causes better blood pressure levels.\nThat said, the results are “compelling enough that I would refer to this study when talking to my own patients about ways they might increase their daily dose of exercise to make an impact on the health of their blood vessels and on their longterm cardiovascular health,” Cheng said in an email.\nThere was a slight difference in the data, showing that sedentary time might be worse for blood pressure in women than men, she added.\n“This makes me think that while the overall takeaways from the study are important for all adults, they may be especially important for women,” Cheng added.\nThe answer for better blood pressure may be more than just a walk in the park, however.\nWhen sedentary time was replaced with non-exercise behaviors –– like sleep, standing, or slow walking –– there was little to no benefit, Blodgett said.\n“Replacing sedentary time with non-high intensity activities such as sleeping, standing or walking requires significant reallocation of time each day to have an impact on BP (if at all),” Blodgett said in an email. “Focusing on replacing sedentary time with small amounts of higher intensity activity or exercise each day may be a more achievable strategy.”\nA good rule of thumb for exercise is to get breathless to the point where it is difficult to speak in full sentences, said Dr. Shaan Khurshid, cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the research.\nFortunately, the biggest impact was seen in those with the lowest amount of activity, meaning you can start off gradually, Blodgett added.\n“If you are currently doing no or a very little amount of higher intensity activity, aim to increase this by 5 minutes a day and increase when you are able,” she said.\nYOUR VOICE\nABC Action News anchor Paul LaGrone went out to get Your Voice after another divisive election.

    "title": "Winter Pollution: 5 Tips To Boost Lung Health",
    "text": "Anti-inflammatory and citrus foods are good for your lungs Several parts of northern India are witnessing the harsh cold weather. Along with the cold wave, high pollution levels have also been recorded in Delhi. The government has imposed several restrictions in the national caption to control increasing pollution levels. Usually, air pollution becomes worse during the winter season. Cold air is denser and moves slower than warm air. Therefore, the trapped air pollutants remain in place for much longer. Both pollution and cold weather affect lung health. Poor air quality and extreme cold weather can pose a range of challenges for respiratory health. To help you keep your lungs healthy, here we have a list of practices that can help boost overall lung health. Some specific nutrients and foods can be beneficial to your lungs. Add anti-inflammatory and citrus foods to your diet. Beetroot, apples, turmeric, tomatoes, green tea, olive oil, yogurt and lentils are good for your lungs. Air purifiers can help keep indoors safe and pollution-free. Therefore, consider investing in air purifiers to provide cleaner air for your family. You can also try installing air-purifying plants. Several dietary and lifestyle changes may help strengthen your body's natural defences. Eat vitamin C-rich foods, exercise regularly, drink enough water, control stress levels, get enough sleep and quit smoking to boost immunity. The cold weather can trigger dry air both indoors and outdoors. The humidity levels also drop drastically during winter. Overexposure to dry air can cause a variety of issues like respiratory conditions, sinus, skin issues, sore throat and more. You can use a humidifier to moisten the air. Inhaling steam can help you breathe better. Steam helps improve respiratory health by eliminating congestion and sore throat. It also helps in loosening mucus. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com When pollution levels are high, it is wise to stay indoors. Also, wear a mask before stepping out.

    "text": "Freedom From Religion Foundation’s television showsheds light on a Catholic organization that has had a pernicious influence on the United States — and globally.\nGareth Gore’s new book is called “Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking and Right-Wing Conspiracy inside the Catholic Church.” Publishers Weekly, in a starred review, calls the work a chilling debut exposé. Gore is a financial journalist based in London who has reported from more than two dozen countries. He’s been published by Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and International Financing Review.\n“What Opus Dei tries to do is, get its members into positions of power and then encourages them to use the positions of power to basically push forward the Opus Dei reactionary agenda, to push back on any kind of progressive forces in society,” Gore tells “Freethought Matters” co-hosts Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor. He also discusses Opus Dei’s influence on some members of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n“Freethought Matters” airs the weekend in:\n-\nChicago, WPWR-CW (Ch. 50), Sundays at 9 a.m.\n-\nLos Angeles, KCOP-MY (Ch. 13), Sundays at 8:30 a.m.\n-\nMadison, Wis., WISC-TV (Ch. 3), Sundays at 11 p.m.\n-\nNew York City, WPIX-IND (Ch. 11), Sundays at 10 a.m.\n-\nSan Francisco, KTVU/KICU-IND (on broadcast Ch. 36 and Cable 6), Sundays at 10 a.m.\n-\nWashington, D.C., WDCW-CW (Ch. 50 or Ch. 23 or Ch. 3), Sundays at 8 a.m.\nIf you don’t live in any of the marquee towns where the show broadcasts on Sunday, you can already catch the interview on FFRF’s YouTube channel. New shows go up every Thursday.\nUpcoming shows include an interview with religious trauma counselor Janice Selbie. You can catch interviews from earlier this season and from previous seasons here, including with Gloria Steinem, Ron Reagan, author John Irving, actor John “Q” de Lancie and award-winning columnist Katha Pollitt.\nPlease tune in to “Freethought Matters” . . . because freethought matters. And spread the word to freethinking friends, family or colleagues about a TV show, finally, that is dedicated to providing programming for freethinkers — your antidote to religion on Sunday morning! Plus, during Halloween weekend, it will be a good way to recover your wits.\nP.S. Please tune in or record according to the times given above regardless of what is listed in your TV guide (it may be listed simply as “paid programming” or even be misidentified).

    "text": "On February 22nd, Montana families across the state will be checking their email with bated breath, in hopes of receiving notification of a coveted private party permit to float the treasured Smith River. Each year, tens of thousands of Montanans and guests to the Big Sky state apply for just a handful of available permits. The annual permit lottery, established by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks in the early 1990s, helps protect this iconic Montana waterway’s many values from its history to its wildlife, its renown wild trout fishery to it deep cultural resources.\nUnfortunately, the Smith River needs and deserves protection from more than keenly managed recreational use. The Smith watershed’s cultural, ecological, recreational, and revenue-driving assets, which benefit all Montanans, are being threatened by industrial-scale mining on both private and public lands, putting fragile populations of wild and native fish, golden eagles, and game animals at risk.\nMining has long been woven into the fabric of Montana and employs many hardworking Montanans. Minerals extracted from Montana soil are used in our daily lives. Clean water and healthy ecosystems are also an intimate and defining part of Montana, and what it means to be Montanan. Some places are just too special to risk even a slim potential from possible mining contamination. The Smith River is one such place.\nThe same Australian-owned company that has proposed a major copper mining operation on the banks of Sheep Creek, the most important coldwater, trout spawning tributary to the Smith River, has also filed nearly 700 mining claims on the public lands adjacent to Sheep Creek. The company has told Montanans it has no plans to mine these public lands, where grazing allotments, invaluable riparian habitat, and public recreation abound. Meanwhile, the company tells its investors of plans for a 50-year mining district spanning to public lands in the Smith watershed.\nCurrently, Montana Trout Unlimited and the Mountain Mamas are working with other organizations, businesses, and individuals to encourage the United States Forest Service (USFS) to withdraw certain federal, public lands within the Smith River watershed from hardrock mineral claims. This “mineral withdrawal” effort needs YOUR help.\nWe are collecting petition signatures to present to agency decision-makers in hopes of obtaining a mineral withdrawal in the next six months. Please visit: https://montanatu.org/smith-mineral-withdrawal/ and sign your name today.\nThe public lands within the Smith have been used for millennia by Montana’s first peoples, with some of the best examples of Native American pictographs in the state. In fact, the Fort Belknap Indian Community and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes have already passed resolutions in support of a mineral withdrawal. We need our decision makers and the USFS to do the same.\nMontana families haven been casting for trout in the honey holes beneath Canyon Depth and telling spooky stories under the moonlight at Parker Flat for generations. The Smith River gives us the opportunity to unplug and reconnect, which precious few places still do. The Smith is a place where you can still wonder at the beauty and secrets of pictographs, peep osprey, watch black bears amble through sloping wildflower meadows, sleep under stars far from the nearest road, listen to nothing but the wind blowing and eagles calling…and have the same experience from one generation to the next. For Montana families, places like the Smith are sacred, and worth protecting.\nSign our petition today, and make your voice heard for a Montana icon.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters David Brooks is the executive director of Montana Trout Unlimited, living in Missoula.

But with Ms. Haley now his last remaining opponent, the machine has turned her way.\nOnline personalities have in recent weeks circulated vicious attacks through memes, posts and videos that often center on her race, gender and identity, including some that malign her for saying she was “teased for being brown” and others that falsely claim she is ineligible to serve as president because her parents were immigrants. Some of the most disturbing material has been generated by artificial intelligence, and digitally manipulates her voice and likeness. Much of the content is rife with crude sexual innuendo.\nJoan Donovan, a disinformation researcher and assistant professor of journalism at Boston University, said the threats and insults were indicative of the form of low politics and “network harassment” that Mr. Trump and his online admirers ushered in.\n“These are people who see themselves as participants in Trump’s troll army,” Ms. Donovan said. “Other politicians haven’t been able to activate online audiences in the same way.”\nAs Ms. Haley and Mr. Trump head into a heated primary showdown on Saturday in South Carolina, her home turf, the online smears are likely only to intensify. And in an era when campaigns wage war online as well as off, not all the efforts have been confined to the internet.\nLaura Loomer, an internet activist close to Mr. Trump who has lobbed harsh personal attacks at Ms. Haley on social media, has also tried to ambush her at campaign events, shouting questions at her staff and surrogates and filming their responses. Alex Stein from BlazeTV has confronted some of Ms. Haley’s young female volunteers.\nFor the better part of the election cycle, Trump staff members, his allies and MAGA fans online directed their energies at Mr. DeSantis, who was subjected to wave after wave of social media posts and videos depicting him, his wife, his staff and his surrogates in deeply unflattering ways. The attacks against the governor focused on his\nmasculinity, loyalty and competence, helped crater his poll numbers and deflated his image among Republican primary voters as a confident warrior for conservative causes.\nThe tide against Ms. Haley began soon after the Iowa caucuses, when it became clear that she, not Mr. DeSantis, represented Mr. Trump’s strongest challenger. At first, the content focused on her foreign policy stance, accusing her of being a “warmonger” and attacking some of her policy decisions as South Carolina’s governor. Although Ms. Haley mostly sought to stay above the fray, her son, Nalin, was willing to hit back at her rivals on social media platforms with\nhis own memes and quips.\nThe tone of the attacks changed drastically after The Daily Mail published a story on Jan. 19 that dredged up old allegations that Ms. Haley had engaged in two extramarital affairs in 2008, two years before she was first elected governor. Ms. Haley has long denied the accusations, but the article prompted a blitz of content on X and other social media platforms depicting her in highly sexualized ways.\nThe posts, often obscene and employing artificial intelligence to manipulate images or mimic Ms. Haley’s voice, did away with traditional political critique, trying instead to cast an opponent as someone with loose morals. Some posts were created by a team of internet trolls that\ncalls itself Trump’s Online War Machine.\nKaren Kedrowski, the director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University, said the content captured the combination of sexist and racist overtones meant to rob targets of authority and convert them into objects of ridicule. The type of harassment, she and other analysts said, can be particularly damaging for female candidates.\n“It reduces women down to being sexual objects,” she said. That can open the door to more dangerous threats or physical violence, she added, pointing to how Ms. Haley\nhas been a target of “swatting,” hoax emergency calls that have sent the authorities scrambling to her door.\nInterest in Ms. Haley appeared to wane this month as Mr. Trump began looking past the primaries toward the general election and MAGA’s internet gladiators pivoted to attacking President Biden and Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney responsible for bringing criminal charges against Mr. Trump that accuse him of\ninterfering with the 2020 election in Georgia. But with the South Carolina primary just days away, Ms. Haley has come back into focus.\nMs. Haley’s supporters and allies see Mr. Trump and his staff as responsible for helping fuel the online vitriol. As Ms. Haley first\nstarted to climb in the polls last year, the former president began calling her “birdbrain.” His top advisers have followed suit and often describe her as “stupid” in online posts. Mr. Trump himself, on his social media site, amplified a report sowing doubt about her citizenship.\nMs. Haley has fired back at some of the attacks coming from Mr. Trump, albeit with mixed results. Her campaign, whose top staff members are women and which has a national coalition of highly active female volunteers, initially and gleefully pointed to the “birdbrain” insults as evidence that the Trump camp was worried about her momentum. Lately, she has stepped up her criticism of the former president,\nblasting him as “unhinged” and a grumpy old man. Her attacks on Mr. Trump’s age and mental fitness have not always landed with some of her supporters, who have said they prefer her previous refusal to get personal.\nMs. Haley’s use of social media tends to be fairly traditional and scripted, as does that of her team, focusing on promoting events, policy and news media appearances. Unlike Mr. Trump, she does not seem to have a wide base of deeply loyal and highly online messengers. And\nan attempt by her campaign to make anti-Trump memes several weeks ago was roundly mocked. Still, some on her staff have engaged directly with Mr. Trump’s team.\nAn online back-and-forth erupted Tuesday after Ms. Haley delivered a speech\nvowing not to drop out, despite a string of early losses and no matter the outcome in South Carolina on Saturday.\nSteven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump well known for slinging insults at the former president’s rivals, said on X that Ms. Haley would “drop down” and praise Mr. Trump once the primary was over. Olivia Perez-Cubas, Ms. Haley’s spokeswoman, responded with a kissing emoji and “xoxo.”\nIn a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Cheung again referred to Ms. Haley as “birdbrain” and said she had yet to name a state that she could win. In response, Ms. Perez-Cubas cited a line from Ms. Haley, who has said that she “attracts all the voters Donald Trump chased out of the party,” a reference to Republican losses in recent elections.\nWith regard to the uptick in content generated by fans of Mr. Trump, Ms. Perez-Cubas said it underscored why “the tone at the top matters.”\n“We need someone who can bring civility back and heal this country,” she said. “You can be tough and strong without being hateful.”\nSome of the offline efforts to troll Ms. Haley’s team have prompted a backlash. Outside the upscale honky-tonk in Dallas where Ms. Haley spoke last week, Mr. Stein, the BlazeTV personality, harangued some of her young female staff members on camera, calling them “hoes” and asking for information about their accounts on OnlyFans, a subscription-based website mainly used by sex workers.\nThe move was criticized online by Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a Republican who had been one of Mr. DeSantis’s top backers, and other conservatives.\n“I debate elevating this behavior, but it must be called out,” Mr. Roy wrote on X. “I have no problem with out-of-the-box efforts to challenge the status quo. But attacking a young, particularly female, campaign staffer or volunteer like this deserves blunt repudiation. Be better, @BlazeTV.”\nMr. Stein has since apologized.\nThe post\n Pro-Trump Internet Trolls Escalate Ugly Attacks on Nikki Haley appeared first on New York Times.",
