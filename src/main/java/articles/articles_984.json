    "title": "Top 5 Japanese SUVs for Off-Road Driving: Daily-Motor.ru Rankings & Reviews - World Today News",
    "text": "Japanese cars have always been unrivaled in terms of reliability, but not the best in terms of off-road capabilities. In recent years, many automakers from the “land of the rising sun” have significantly expanded the line of their crossovers and SUVs, but have not forgotten about their special versions, aimed at overcoming all kinds of obstacles. Daily-Motor.ru has compiled a list of the top five Japanese SUVs that perform well away from the asphalt. Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro Designed specifically for Off-Road, the 4Runner is capable of going where a regular SUV can’t. And all thanks to Fox shock absorbers, as well as a ground clearance of about 23 cm. All this comes in addition to an advanced all-wheel drive system and a multi-link rear suspension that improves on-board comfort. Subaru Outback Wilderness Subaru has always been known for its excellent all-wheel drive system. And the Outback is no exception. But the Wilderness version makes these figures even better thanks to an increased ground clearance of up to 24 cm, as well as good approach/departure angles and the presence of “toothy” tires. Toyota Sequoia TRD Pro Another member of the Toyota TRD Pro family, which is designed to go where a regular Sequoia shouldn’t go. It has an independent rear suspension equipped with a limited-slip differential and a fully locking rear differential. The icing on the cake is the 5.7-liter V8 engine, which produces almost 400 horsepower. Nissan Navara Pro-4X A special version of the popular Nissan pickup truck, which is able to cope with its task (off-road driving) even better than its usual version. Read more: \"Besix-MBL Joint Venture Awarded Contract for Three Kilometers of Quay Walls in Neom's Futuristic Port City\" The vehicle is equipped with shock absorbers from Bilstein, underbody protection, and front towing hooks. Ground clearance exceeds 25 centimeters, and all-wheel drive is virtually trouble-free. Toyota RAV4 Adventure Offroad Package II The slightly raised version of the best-selling RAV4, adapted for off-road use, differs from simple crossovers by the presence of a special plastic body kit, protected from damage in the form of small scratches. The car will definitely not catch stars from the sky on an “Off-road” vehicle, but its owner can more actively “attack” obstacles without fear of causing unpleasant damage to the appearance of the SUV.

    "text": "French Senate backs move to ban headscarf in sport\nFrance's right-dominated Senate has backed a bill to ban religious symbols including the Muslim headscarf in all sport competitions – professional and amateur – sparking accusations of discrimination from the left, and rights advocates.\nIssued on: Modified:\nThe upper-house Senate voted 210 to 81 this week to ban \"the wearing of any sign or outfit ostensibly showing a political or religious affiliation\" in competitions at regional and national level organised by all the country's sports federations.\nThe bill still needs a majority of votes from the lower-house National Assembly to become law, but the right-leaning government has thrown its weight behind the measure.\nUnder France's brand of secularism, civil servants, teachers and pupils cannot wear any obvious religious symbols such as a Christian cross, Jewish kippa, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf, also known as a hijab.\nWhile such a sweeping ban does not yet exist across all sports in France, several federations have already prohibited religious clothing including in football and basketball.\nThe draft law also bans outfits that might \"contravene\" principles of French secularism in France's swimming pools.\nFrench collective seeks to overturn ban on wearing Islamic veils during football matches\nGovernment's support\nCritics see the headscarf worn by some Muslim women as a symbol of creeping Islamisation after deadly jihadist attacks in France, while others say they are just practising their religion and should wear what they want.\nMichel Savin, the senator from the right-wing Republicans (LR) party who put forward the draft law, said \"communitarian temptations\" had overrun sports arenas.\nJunior interior minister Francois-Noel Buffet, also from LR, said during the vote that the \"government forcefully supports\" the bill, describing it as a welcome move \"against separatism\".\nThey were opposed by several senators on the left, who called the bill a violation of the 1905 law to protect freedom of conscience.\n\"By using this founding principle to serve your anti-Muslim rhetoric, you are only fomenting confusion... and stereotypes,\" Socialist senator Patrick Kanner said.\n'Discriminatory'\nMathilde Ollivier, a Greens party senator, accused the right of \"directly and gutlessly targeting Muslim women\" in order to \"exclude\" them from sport.\nAmnesty International, ahead of the vote, said such a law would only \"exacerbate the blatant religious, racial and gender discrimination already experienced by Muslim women in France\".\n\"All women have the right to choose what to wear,\" said Amnesty researcher Anna Blus.\n\"The sports hijab bans in France are yet another measure underpinned by Islamophobia and a patriarchal attempt to control what Muslim women wear.\"\nActivists slam France hijab ban saying 'sports should be inclusive'\nUN experts in October said that the football and basketball federations' rules as well as the French government's decision to prevent French athletes from wearing the headscarf while representing their country at the Paris Olympics, were \"disproportionate and discriminatory\".\n(with AFP)\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\nSubscribe",

    "text": "Jaci Yula (Courtesy photo)\nJulie Burton (Courtesy photo)\nShow Caption 1 of 2 Jaci Yula (Courtesy photo)\nExpand A new school year means new faces and Ayres Elementary has quite a few, nine to be exact.\nJaci Yula Jaci Yula is a new second grade teacher. She was born and raised in Sterling and education has always been in her family with both of her parents teaching in the district for a combined 65 years. Yula taught for three years at the college level and loved every minute of it.\n“Truly I’ve been ‘teaching’ and educating since high school, however; whether it be choreography, trainings for communities and behavioral health populations, or coaching. Now, I’m excited to educate our future leaders,” Yula said.\nWhile she has been in marketing and advertising all of her professional career, she wanted to do something where she truly felt she was making a difference in the lives of children, so she turned to teaching. She also thought the school schedule would be very nice so that she has the opportunity to spend more time with her own two children.\nAs for why she decided to join the staff at Ayres, Yula said it’s simple, she loves kids. She works in the community with Sterling Miracle Players and the SHS Theatre Program and loves spending time getting to know each student.\n“I am blessed to have amazing educational mentors from my husband John, both of my parents, Bernie and Melverie Mathis, and also my mother-in-law Mary Yula. Your advice, mentorship, and keys for success have been heard and will be used now and in the future. Even if you don’t think I’m listening,” Yula said.\nJulie Burton Another new face is first grease teacher Julie Burton. She is from Sterling but grew up in Akron. Her primary education is in soil and crop sciences/agronomy.\nBurton quietly wanted to go into the education field for years. Countless professional assessments steered her toward teaching, however, she found herself securely in a position in the banking world for 20+ years.\n“It made me a little unsure about making the move to education,” she said.\nBut after several summers of discussions with the RE-1 Valley administration, she decided to take the plunge and apply. She was offered a position at Ayres quickly after her interview and everything fell together.\n“I love teaching in general. Seeing someone have those ‘ah ha moments’ is incredibly fulfilling for me,” Burton said, adding that she chose elementary education because she loves children, the way they absorb things like a sponge and love unconditionally with no ulterior motives. “Education allows me something with the time I have on Earth that truly impacts others. The future of our world is in our classrooms today!”\nTori Karr\nAlso joining the staff is kindergarten teacher Tori Karr. She is from Wyoming and is currently enrolled in the T-Prep program through Northeastern Junior College seeking her bachelor’s degree in elementary education.\nKarr chose to go into education to give back. Growing up she had many amazing teachers who truly shaped who she is today.\n“I hope that I can encourage my students to dream and find a true love for learning,” she said.\nKarr decded to join Ayres because she was ready for a career change.\n“I wanted to do something that would make a difference and I’ve always loved working with children. It’s an amazing opportunity to get to teach while going to school and I’m blessed to be a part of the awesome team at RE-1 Valley,” she said.\nOthers joining the staff are kindergarten teacher Micaela Prettyman, librarian Kyra Essman, teacher assistants Ally Seriani and Aaliyah Ingram and social emotional learning specialist Joyce Vasquez and new to the school but not new to the district is Kaitlin Kirschbaum who transferred over from Sterling Middle School to teach second grade.",

    "title": "ÚLTIMA HORA GUERRA RUSIA UCRANIA | Directo y última de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania: Zelenski, Trump, Putin...",
    "text": "El presidente ruso Vladímir Putin ordenó a sus tropas invadir la vecina Ucrania el 24 de febrero de 2022. Desde entonces, la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa. Sigue al minuto las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta de Kiev. Estados Unidos impulsa vías para alcanzar el fin de la guerra. La tregua está más cerca.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 9:00\nUcrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022 El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022. \"Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará\", aseguró Sibiga en la red social X. El ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere \"más que nadie\" que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes. \"Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor\", reclamó.\n12 JUN 2025 - 8:30\nAl menos 14 heridos en un nuevo ataque nocturno ruso contra Járkov Al menos 14 civiles resultaron heridos este jueves en un ataque nocturno con drones rusos contra la ciudad de Járkov, en el noreste de Ucrania, y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, un día después de que murieran tres personas y otras 60 fueran heridas en circunstancias similares. \"Por la noche, el enemigo atacó Járkov con drones. Se produjeron incendios en los distritos de Saltivski, Slobodski y Shevchenkivski de la ciudad; ardieron viviendas, locales comerciales y coches. 14 personas fueron heridas, incluidos cuatro niños\", informaron los servicios de emergencia del Estado en Telegram. Las labores de rescate y de apagado de incendios todavía continúan.\n11 JUN 2025 - 15:59\nSistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot Rusia afirmó este miércoles haber recibido aclaraciones de lsrael acerca del supuesto envío de un sistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot a Ucrania, que le permiten desmentir esta información. \"Hemos recibido aclaraciones del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Israel que indican que estas declaraciones no se corresponden con la realidad\", señaló en rueda de prensa la portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores de Rusia, María Zajárova.\n11 JUN 2025 - 13:26\nRusia dice que sus tropas avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk Unidades de dos agrupaciones militares del Ejército ruso avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk tras cruzar la frontera de la región de Donetsk , según informó este miércoles el Ministerio de Defensa de este país. \"Unidades de la agrupación militar Este salieron a la frontera occidental de la República Popular de Donetsk y están llevando a cabo una ofensiva en el territorio de la región de Dnipropetrovsk\", señala la nota castrense. Según el parte militar, en esta dirección los ucranianos contaron con 225 bajas desde el último comunicado durante combates en las localidades de Shevchenko, en la región ucraniana de Donetsk, Guliáipole y Malínovka, en la región de Zaporiyia, a unos 100 kilómetros entre las capitales de ambas regiones.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:55\nEl presidente de Serbia viaja a Ucrania por primera vez desde el inicio de la invasión rusa El presidente de Serbia , Aleksandar Vucic , aterrizará este miércoles en Ucrania en la que es su primera visita al país desde que comenzó la invasión rusa del territorio, un viaje que se enmarca en la cumbre que tendrá lugar en la ciudad de Odesa y en la que participarán más de una decena de líderes del sureste de Europa. Así lo ha confirmado la Presidencia serbia en un comunicado, en el que ha matizado que la visita de Vucic, que mantiene buenas relaciones y lazos históricos con Rusia, durará únicamente un día.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:11\nRepatrian a Ucrania los restos mortales de más de 1.200 soldados caídos Los restos mortales de un total de 1 .212 soldados ucranianos caídos cuyos cadáveres estaban en manos de las autoridades rusas han sido retornados a Ucrania , según anunció este miércoles en un comunicado el órgano del Estado ucraniano que se ocupa de los prisioneros de guerra. Se trata del primer retorno de cadáveres que se anuncia desde que ucranianos y rusos acordaran el 2 de junio en Estambul canjear los restos mortales de 6.000 soldados de cada bando que están en posesión del enemigo.\n11 JUN 2025 - 8:33\nAl menos dos muertos y 60 heridos en un nuevo ataque ruso contra Járkov Al menos dos personas murieron y otras 60 resultaron heridas en un nuevo ataque con drones lanzado anoche por las fuerzas rusas contra la ciudad de Járkov , en el noreste de Ucrania y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, según ha informado la Policía ucraniana en un comunicado. Entre los heridos hay, según la fuente, cinco niños, de los que tres han tenido que ser trasladados a un centro médico. Los dos muertos son una mujer de 47 años y un hombre de 65.\n10 JUN 2025 - 22:53\nFelipe VI llega a Eslovaquia para visitar a las tropas españolas del despliegue de la OTAN ante Rusia El rey Felipe VI llegó hoy a Eslovaquia para visitar este miércoles a las tropas españolas que lideran la brigada multinacional que la OTAN tiene desplegada en este país como parte de las medidas disuasorias ante Rusia en Europa del Este.\nEn rey, que llegó a Bratislava acompañado por la ministra de Defensa, Margarita Robles , fue recibido por el presidente eslovaco, Peter Pellegrini, en su residencia oficial en la capital, el Palacio Grassalkovich.\nEslovaquia es miembro de la Alianza desde 2004 y de la Unión Europea (UE) desde 2007.\n10 JUN 2025 - 21:40\nEl ataque ruso contra Kiev provoca daños en una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía El ataque ruso de anoche contra la capital ucraniana dañó una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía , un monumento histórico protegido por la UNESCO cuyos orígenes se remontan al siglo XI.\nSegún explicó la directora del complejo que alberga la catedral, el daño sufrido por la cornisa, que fue construida en el siglo XVII, tardará en ser reparado alrededor de un mes y medio.\nEl daño en el edificio fue causado por la onda expansiva de una de las múltiples explosiones que sacudieron la pasada madrugada el centro y otras zonas de Kiev, debidas a la caída o las interceptaciones de los drones y misiles lanzados por Rusia.\n10 JUN 2025 - 20:19\nUcrania evalúa limitar la red móvil para contrarrestar la amenaza de drones rusos Ucrania estudia introducir restricciones temporales en los servicios de telefonía móvil para perturbar el uso que Rusia hace de las redes móviles ucranianas para recabar información durante los ataques cada vez más masivos con drones, según deliberaciones en el seno de la comisión de Defensa del Parlamento ucraniano.\nLos drones rusos de largo alcance, incluidos los Shahed de fabricación iraní, están cada vez más equipados con tarjetas SIM ucranianas de prepago para recoger y transmitir datos críticos durante los vuelos, según informan los expertos que analizan los restos de drones.\nEsta inteligencia ayuda a Rusia a perfeccionar sus operaciones con drones y amenaza con hacer sus ataques cada vez más eficaces.",

    "text": "'Jesus in the rubble': Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem cancelled At Christmastime, the world comes to Bethlehem. The rooftop of the city hall is packed with camera crews from around the globe to capture a towering tree in Manger Square as the bells toll for midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity, built upon the grotto where, by tradition, Jesus was born. This year there will be no tree. No parades, bands or music. No lights. No markets, no feasts, no carols. No Santas handing out candy to the children. And no pilgrims. No tourists. In place of traditional holiday decorations, one church here has created a simple Nativity scene for Christmas 2023: Jesus enters the world amid a pile of Gazan rubble. The atmosphere in Bethlehem on the eve of Christmas this year is sombre, dark, sad - and political. The mass of Boy Scouts who traditionally accompany the Latin Patriarch's procession into the city - 28 troops' worth, blasting bagpipes - has been pared down to a single silent troop. The boys will hold aloft Bible verses on peace and, perhaps, photographs of Gazan children. Christian leaders here are careful to condemn the surprise Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, when Hamas killed 1200 people and took about 240 more hostage, triggering current hostilities. But they appear most focused on the war since. The Israel Defence Forces, fighting to eradicate Hamas, have killed more than 20,000 people in Gaza, the enclave's health ministry said Friday. With water, food and shelter all short, international aid groups warn a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding. The Holy Land is home mostly to Jews and Muslims. But 2% of the Palestinian population of the West Bank is Christian, with many of them proudly tracing their roots back a millennium or more. There also exists a tiny remnant of Christians - maybe a thousand people, no more - in Gaza. In his annual Christmas message, Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Hanania spoke this year of mourning - and condemned Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza as \"ethnic cleansing\" and \"genocide.\" So did the head of the chamber of commerce. \"I am sad and upset at the moral failure of the West\" to stop the killing of civilians in Gaza, Samir Hazboun said. Christian clergy here use similar language, blaming the failure to protect the innocent on world leaders including US President Joe Biden. The Reverend Munther Isaac, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, stood beside the small Nativity scene in his chapel. The baby Jesus sat amid flickering candles atop a pile of busted cement and dirty stone. \"This is what Christmas looks like in Palestine,\" Issac said. \"This is the true message.\" At first, he said, the idea of placing the birth of Jesus in a war zone \"was shocking - it was hard for even our own people. But it left a strong impression because the image is very real, it confronts you with the reality - then and now - in a very powerful way.\" \"If Jesus were born today,\" he said, \"he would be born in Gaza amid the rubble.\" \"Who can sing 'Joy to the World' today?\" Photos of the scene have gone viral. A similar installation is to be placed in Manger Square before Christmas Eve. Today, Isaac said, the Christmas story feels more contemporary than ever. In the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph, a Jewish man living in Palestine under Roman rule, is forced to report to Bethlehem for a census. He takes his young, pregnant wife, Mary. Unable to find lodgings - there's no room at the inn - they settle in a stable. There, in a manger - a feed trough for animals - Mary gives birth to the child who the faithful believe is the son of God. King Herod of Judea, learning of the birth of a rival, orders that all male children under 2 be killed: the Slaughter of the Innocents. Jesus, Mary and Joseph flee to Egypt. \"So the story is Jesus is born into hardship, lived under occupation, survived a massacre, and became a refugee,\" Isaac said. \"This is a story we Palestinians can understand.\" Bethlehem is just a few miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank. There are 19km of high wall and fencing. There are Israeli checkpoints to get in and out of the city, where Palestinians on foot pass through scanners and answer questions by Israeli border guards. Many of those check points are closed now, or only open a few hours a day, because of the Gaza war and the rise in violence in the West Bank. Hanania said he \"cannot believe what we are watching in Gaza. These are the worst days that Palestinians have ever seen.\" In the lead-up to the holiday this year, the painstakingly renovated Church of the Nativity, which dates back to the 6th century, has seen almost no visitors. A few journalists wandered about. A Danish priest and his daughter came. A local family marvelled at the graffiti from the Crusades and the restored 12th-century mosaics depicting hovering angels. \"It's like the Covid times, but worse,\" custodian Nicola Hadur said. In a normal year, he said, pilgrims and tourists would wait in multiple lines for hours to see the cave in which Jesus is said to have been born. There are 78 hotels and 5700 rooms in Bethlehem today. In normal times, 6000 tourists come daily - you can't move for the tour buses. There were only 624 foreign visitors during the entire month of November, according to the tourist police. Most were from Indonesia. Behind the Church of the Nativity, Victor Tabah's souvenir shop sat empty. \"I do not blame anyone for this situation, not Hamas or anyone,\" the 77-year-old grandfather said. \"We have to blame ourselves, we need to be strong and have to keep going.\" This year? \"Christmas is finished, we do not see Christmas anymore, it is supposed to be for our children, but we do not have a Christmas anymore,\" said Tabah, who has three children and seven grandchildren. Rami Asakrieh, a Franciscan friar, is pastor of St Catherine's Church, where midnight Mass is to be celebrated. (Masses by the Orthodox and other Christian faiths will follow.) \"They say that we are cancelling Christmas,\" Asakrieh said. \"But we have only cancelled the celebrations of Christmas. We will say Mass.\" \"It's impossible to celebrate when so many - on both sides - have lost so much,\" he said. \"We cancelled the festivities as a sign of solidarity with the victims of the war.\" Asakrieh joined the other clerics of Bethlehem last month in sending a letter to Biden and to Congress. \"God has placed political leaders in a position of power so that they can bring justice, support those who suffer, and be instruments of God's peace,\" they wrote. \"We need the Christmas message more than ever,\" Asakrieh said. \"We need the peace and love. We need the light.\" The Washington Post",
