    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards By Ramishah Maruf, CNN New York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission [ issued several warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/magnetic-ball-recall-warning/index.html) for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death. Walmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy. Earlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s [small parts cylinder](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Small-Parts-for-Toys-and-Childrens-Products) (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.” The agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States. The recall affects about 4,240 units. [The CPSC said](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/High-Powered-Magnetic-Balls-Recalled-Due-to-Ingestion-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-on-Walmart-com-through-Joybuy) customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.

    "title": "John Laurinaitis' Lawyer Says Laurinaitis Victim to Vince Mcmahon",
    "text": "[wrestling](/wrestling/) / [News](/wrestling/category/News/) Attorney for John Laurinaitis Claims Laurinaitis Was a ‘Victim’ to ‘Predator’ Vince McMahon [VICE News](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epv757/co-defendant-in-vince-mcmahon-sex-trafficking-lawsuit-says-he-was-a-victim-too) reports that the lawyer for former WWE executive John Laurinaitis has appeared to corroborate central claims in the lawsuit against himself and former Chairman of the Board for WWE parent company TKO Vince McMahon. Laurinaitis’ attorney is even going so far as saying that Laurinaitis was a “victim” to the “predator” Vince McMahon. Attorney Edward Brennan reportedly corroborated the claims against McMahon, but has disputed Laurinaitis’ role in the complaint. [As noted](https://411mania.com/wrestling/vince-mcmahon-accused-sex-trafficking-lawsuit/), former WWE staffer Janel Grant filed a lawsuit against McMahon and Laurinaitis, accusing them of sex trafficking and misconduct. Brennan added on his client, “The truth will come out.” In reaching out to Brennan regarding his representation to Laurinaitis, the attorney confirmed that he’s representing Laurinaitis and also denying the allegations. Brennan stated to VICE, “Mr. Laurinaitis denies the allegations in the misguided complaint and will be vigorously defending these charges in Court, not the media. Like the Plaintiff, Mr. Laurinaitis is a victim in this case, not a predator. The truth will come out.” In asking for clarification that Brennan was stating that McMahon was a predator, and that Laurinaitis was being victimized by him, Brennan wrote to the publication, “Read the allegations. Read the Federal Statute. Power, control, employment supervisory capacity, dictatorial sexual demands with repercussions if not met. Count how many times in the complaint Vince exerts control over both of them.” Grant claims in her lawsuit that McMahon trafficked her to Laurinaitis and other men in the company. She also alleged that McMahon and Laurinaitis once locked her in a room and took turns sexually assaulting both her in WWE’s corporate offices. McMahon resigned from his post as Executive Chairman of the Board of TKO last Friday (Jan. 26). He denied Grant’s allegations, saying, “Ms. Grant’s lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth.” Laurinaitis was [reportedly terminated](https://411mania.com/wrestling/john-laurinaitis-terminated-by-wwe/) by WWE in August 2022 when reports of the scandal involving McMahon and Grant, along with Laurinaitis’ involvement, initially emerged. VICE News reports that TKO did not immediately respond to requests for comments on Brennan’s statements earlier. Also, a spokesperson for Janel Grant, reportedly declined to comment.",

    "text": "Everyday Products We’re All Guilty Of Buying But Are Actually Useless\nWe all want to make our lives easier, healthier, or more stylish, and companies know exactly how to target these desires. However, some everyday products that seem like essentials are nothing more than clever marketing ploys. From items that overpromise and underdeliver to those that outright take advantage of our trust, it’s time to take a closer look. Here’s what people are saying about the most overrated products you’re better off skipping.\n1. Detox Teas\nDetox teas have been marketed as miracle solutions for weight loss and cleansing, but many are nothing more than glorified laxatives. Not only are the supposed health claims unproven, but they can also lead to dehydration and other health risks. Experts agree that your body already has a natural detox system, your liver and kidneys. Save your money and opt for a balanced diet instead.\n2. Extended Warranties\nExtended warranties sound like a safe bet, but they’re often a waste of money. Most products either don’t break during the warranty period or repairs cost less than the warranty itself. Plus, manufacturers’ standard warranties usually cover the same issues. Instead of paying extra, consider setting aside an emergency fund for unexpected repairs.\n3. Fancy Water Bottles\nDesigner water bottles with claims of advanced filtration or enhanced hydration benefits have gained massive popularity. But in reality, most of them don’t offer anything that a simple reusable bottle with a regular filter can’t provide. Often, the markup is for aesthetics rather than performance. Stick to an affordable, functional bottle and avoid falling for the hype.\n4. Premium Cables\nWhether it’s HDMI, USB, or charging cables, premium brands often charge outrageous prices for products that perform no better than cheaper alternatives. Most electronics stores rely on these high-margin items to boost profits, but the truth is, a $10 cable often works just as well as a $50 one. When buying cables, look for certified, budget-friendly options instead.\nRelated Articles\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the promises of flashy products, but a little skepticism can go a long way in protecting your wallet. Many of the everyday items we think we need are either unnecessary or overpriced. Next time you’re tempted by clever marketing, remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Choose wisely, and you’ll save money while avoiding disappointment.",
