Picture: The Siberian Times The KGK Group of companies, a global leader in gems and jewellery, aims to employ up to 500 people at their new facility near Vladivostok. The company has already found a location in the city, which it aims to use before a new factory is complete. The Indian investors were granted a certificate of residence for the newly-created Free Port of Vladivostok, which will give them tax and customs preferences, and lower costs for ships in the port. The first work will begin in July this year with the factory completion slated for the end of 2019. KGK also plans to open a training centre for staff.

In September 2016 Alrosa opened its Eurasian Diamond Centre, a one-stop facility with traders, diamond and jewellery manufacturers, gemological laboratories, banks, insurance companies, specialised transport companies, customs checkpoint and state control gathered under one roof. The KGK group has branches in Moscow and the diamond region of Yakutia, and sees its new facility in Vladivostok as a gateway to the markets of Asia-Pacific region. With China's capital Beijing being just two hours flight away, and South Korea close by, the Indian investors envision the Russian Far East as a prime location. The company plans to cut up to 9,000 carat a month. Scheme would allow epic journeys from London to the Japanese capital with major international crossing between Sakhalin and Hokkaido. Delegation of 69, including the representatives of 32 private companies, state and municipal structures arrived in the Southern Kurils.

    "text": "WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Conservative news outlet Newsmax Media defamed Dominion Voting Systems with its false reporting accusing the voting machine company of rigging the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a Delaware judge ruled Wednesday.\nDominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages to be determined by a Delaware jury in a trial scheduled to begin on April 28 in Wilmington, said Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis.\nA Dominion representative said in a statement that the company was gratified by the court's thorough ruling.\nA Newsmax representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\nShares of Newsmax were down more than 10% in late Wednesday trading while broader stock indexes were posting their biggest rally in years. The company made a stellar debut on the New York Stock Exchange after an initial public offering that raised $75 million last month.\nDenver-based Dominion sued Newsmax in 2021 for broadcasting false claims that Dominion machines stole the election from President Donald Trump, who was defeated by President Joe Biden.\nTrump spent weeks after the vote claiming the election had been stolen without ever presenting credible evidence of fraud.\nDavis said that Newsmax statements that Dominion aided in election fraud, manipulated votes using an algorithm, was linked to Venezuela, paid kickbacks to government officials and was tied to voting irregularities in Dallas were false and amounted to defamation.\nDavis said in addition to damages, jurors must decide if Dominion is entitled to punitive damages, which can be awarded if Newsmax conduct was \"willful and wanton.\"\nNewsmax's stock began publicly trading last month and surged to more than $200 a share from its debut at $10 per share. It closed at $34.71 on Wednesday.\nNewsmax last year agreed to pay $40 million to settle defamation allegations brought by Smartmatic, a voting machine company that brought similar defamation allegations.\nDominion settled a similar defamation lawsuit against Fox News in 2023 for $787.5 million just as the case was about to go to trial two years ago in front of the same judge.\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware and Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Chris Reese and Sonali Paul)\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

    "text": "Premier Li Qiang pledged on Thursday to enhance ties between China and the Solomon Islands, and expressed Beijing's commitment to working with Pacific island countries to build an even closer community with a shared future. Li made the remarks during his talks in Beijing with Jeremiah Manele, prime minister of the Solomon Islands. Manele is making a weeklong official visit to China that started on Tuesday. China will continue to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equality, mutually beneficial cooperation and common development to promote the steady development of comprehensive strategic partnerships with Pacific island countries, including the Solomon Islands, Li said. During the meeting, Li highlighted the robust growth of bilateral relations over the past five years since the two countries established diplomatic ties, saying that political mutual trust between China and the Solomon Islands has continuously deepened and their exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been fruitful. China supports the Solomon Islands in independently choosing a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to work together to firmly support each other's core interests, he said. China is ready to share more development experiences with the Solomon Islands and strengthen cooperation in infrastructure, rural development, communication and low-carbon transformation, Li said. He also noted that the nation is also willing to import more high-quality agricultural products from the Solomon Islands and encourage eligible Chinese enterprises to invest in the country. Both sides should enhance exchanges and cooperation in education, healthcare, culture, sports and youth development, deepen subnational partnership, and further facilitate people-to-people exchanges, in order to solidify the foundation of public support for bilateral cooperation, he added. Manele expressed his appreciation for the fruitful cooperation between the Solomon Islands and China over the past five years, and thanked China for its strong support for the economic and social development of his country. The Solomon Islands steadfastly adheres to the one-China principle, supports President Xi Jinping's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and highly appreciates China's contributions to promoting world peace and development, he said. It is willing to deepen cooperation with China in the fields of economy and trade, infrastructure construction, healthcare, culture and poverty alleviation, and jointly address global challenges such as climate change, he added. Following their talks, the two leaders witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation agreements on jointly building of the Belt and Road, economy and trade, education, the digital economy, green development, and inspection and quarantine. Egyptian leader greeted In another development, Premier Li congratulated Mustafa Madbouly on his reappointment as Egyptian prime minister on Thursday. In a congratulatory message sent to Madbouly, Li highlighted the deep-rooted friendship between China and Egypt, emphasizing the robust development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations in recent years, which he said has brought tangible benefits to the people of both countries. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of Sino-Egyptian relations, and is willing to work together with the new Egyptian government to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries to deepen political mutual trust and enhance friendly cooperation in various fields to drive bilateral relations to new heights, Li said.",

    "title": "Smart nanoprobe illuminates prostate cancer cells",
    "text": "Newswise — Biomedical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have revolutionized the ability to detect and track the progress of many cancer types. However, the difficulty of obtaining detailed images of cancer cells buried deep within normal tissues has slowed the usefulness of imaging technology for improved, personalized cancer care. An approach biomedical engineers are pursuing to overcome this limitation involves building nanoprobes that are designed to travel throughout the body, accumulate in cancer cells, and send a signal that illuminates the tumor. NIBIB-supported researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a smart nanoprobe designed to infiltrate prostate tumors and send back a signal using an optical imaging technique known as Raman spectroscopy. The new probe, reported in Advanced Science , has the potential to determine tumor aggressiveness and could also enable sequential monitoring of tumors during therapy to quickly determine if a treatment strategy is working. “We are excited about the potential for improving diagnosis and treatment of many common cancers,” explained the project leaders Jeff Bulte, Ph.D., and Ishan Barman, Ph.D. “We are combining self-assembling nanoprobes with Raman spectroscopy to achieve precise, single-cell resolution images required for eventual practical use in the clinic.” The engineering team constructed a nanoprobe that is sensitive to its local microenvironment: it is activated only after it encounters legumain, a tumor-associated enzyme that is produced by aggressive prostate cancer cells. Once it encounters the nanoprobe, legumain splits it into pieces that can self-assemble to create an optically active nanoparticle. These nanoparticles emit specific wavelengths of light that can be detected with Raman spectroscopy to visualize the tumor. Postdoctoral fellows Swati Tanwar, Ph.D., and Behnaz Ghaemi, Ph.D., spearheaded the design and synthesis of the nanoprobe, called nanoSABER (for Self-Assembling Bioorthogonal Enzyme Recognition)—an apt name that reflects the surgical precision of the smart molecule. “We have chosen Raman reporters that are specifically active in the 'cell silent' region of the near-infrared spectrum to avoid interference with the signal from normal tissue,” explained Barman. “This selective activity is crucial for our imaging technique, as it allows for precise detection by Raman spectroscopy without reacting with or being obscured by the surrounding biological material.” The researchers used two prostate cancer cell lines exhibiting varying levels of legumain expression—one high and one low—alongside a non-cancerous prostate epithelial cell line, which produces a negligible amount of the enzyme. NanoSABER was tested in laboratory cell cultures and in an experimental mouse model. In both settings, the prostate cells expressing legumain activated the nanoprobe and emitted a signal with an intensity that corresponded to the amount of legumain produced by the cancer cells. The non-legumain cell type did not activate the nanoprobe, demonstrating that the nanoSABER system performed as designed, emitting a signal that correctly indicated the presence and amount of the cancer-associated enzyme. “The work by this group is a significant step towards better care for men afflicted with prostate cancer,” explained Tatjana Atanasijevic, Ph.D., a program director in the Division of Applied Science & Technology at NIBIB. “It is an excellent example of the type of innovative technologies NIBIB supports that have the potential to dramatically impact health care.” The team believes they have engineered a molecular system with the potential to not only identify tumors using optical imaging but to also rapidly assess tumor aggressiveness—potentially without the need for painful biopsies that are the current standard of care. In addition, as profiles of enzyme secretion by different types of cancers are discovered, additional nanoSABER probes can be synthesized that will allow a level of precise diagnosis of tumor types and characteristics that is not currently possible, including sequential imaging of tumors to determine whether therapies are working in real time. This work was supported by grants from NIBIB (R01EB030376, P41EB015871, and P41EB024495), the National Cancer Institute (NCI; R01CA238025), and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS; R35GM149272 and DP2GM128198). This science highlight describes a basic research finding. Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology, which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Science is an unpredictable and incremental process—each research advance builds on past discoveries, often in unexpected ways. Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic research.

The often deadly quest for civil rights for Black Americans was a battle well worth fighting. The tragedy of Vietnam for those of us in uniform, (personally, I was on active-duty Navy and Marines from '65 to '75), tore a generation asunder [snip] However, the one truly unifying pride all felt during that fractious decade was the world class and very public and dramatic American scientific and engineering quest to meet the great challenge of President Kennedy: Comments: Watch the video, and note the relatively large steering angles on the rocket exhaust and the relatively high tilt angles of the rocket body necessary to make the large, yet precise corrections to put he rocket where it needs to be then the rocket throttles up to stop it's descent and come to a hover as the arms grab it.

    "title": "¿Por qué nos fascinan tanto los eclipses de sol?",
    "text": "La fascinación por los astros y nuestra relación con ellos es algo que podría asegurar que está escrito en nuestro código genético, bien dicen los astrobiólogos que somos polvo de estrellas, ¿será esa la resonancia interna que nos hace mirar al cielo con tanto interés? Sentada en una roca que perteneció al mar de Tetis, rodeada de corales y flores del desierto, me preparaba para recibir al eclipse de sol este lunes. Eran las 11:07am, cuando un ave cantó anunciando su inicio. Este gran fenómeno ha movilizado personas de todo el mundo para visitar Coahuila, un místico desierto que dialoga con el majestuoso espectáculo solar. Así es como llegó el grupo de exploradores de Kosmica Institut, integrado por artistas y científicos de México, Alemania y Francia, entre otros. Creo fuertemente que el binomio arte-ciencia es una piedra fundamental para evolucionar nuestra forma de comprender y habitar nuestros territorios. Pues necesitamos con urgencia renombrar las relaciones territoriales, evolucionar la forma en que las comprendemos y habitamos. Aquí recae la importancia de proyectos como Kosmica Institut, una organización que tiene más de 10 años de actividades, enfocándose en desarrollar propuestas que unifican las artes con la ciencias espaciales. Su fundador, Nahum Romero, quién lleva el Instituto en Europa, nos comparte que inició en 2011 en Londres, junto con Arts Catalyst, cuando estaban iniciando el Comité para los usos Culturales del Espacio en la Federación Internacional de Astronáutica. Cuando le pregunto cuál es su visión respecto a la relación entre arte y ciencia, comenta: “Mi visión sobre arte y ciencia, es que son lenguajes distintos, que pueden compartir una fascinación por hacer sentido sobre un tema en específico, y generar diálogos muy interesantes para poder enriquecer nuestro entendimiento sobre el mismo”. En México las actividades, son coordinadas por Manuel Díaz, a quién he conocido en el Museo del Desierto, pues el grupo de exploración ha hecho una breve parada en Saltillo, para conocer más del territorio, antes del eclipse. “Me atrevo a decir que nos consideramos herederos de la gran gran cultura de observación astronómica que se ha vivido en esta tierra en el Anáhuac y lo estamos manifestando de otras maneras como corresponde este tiempo”, agregó. Tanto Nahum como Manuel, mencionan que trabajar con el tema arte-cosmos, no es una novedad, pues las artes espaciales son la expresión más ancestral del arte, siendo las culturas originarias quienes las plasmaron desde tiempos remotos. Esto coincide con el reciente artículo que nos compartió Claudia Luna, Directora de Divulgación Científica del Museo del Desierto. Ahí el investigador José Flores Ventura, nos muestra los hallazgos encontrados en los petroglifos de Narigua, sobre cómo los nativos de Coahuila, documentaron los eventos astronómicos. Como parte del grupo de exploradores se encuentra Bernard Foing, quién ha trabajado 25 años con la Agencia Espacial Europea, y fue el científico principal del Proyecto SMART-1, la primera misión europea a la Luna. Todos nos hemos preguntado, ¿por qué tanta fascinación por el eclipse? ¿por qué es relevante para la vida de los seres humanos?, Bernard responde: “Uno se da cuenta que nosotros somos parte del espacio, no es sólo algo exterior, sabemos que por ejemplo la vida está hecha de condiciones de nuestro planeta, pero también de ingredientes que vienen del cosmos, que estamos muy vinculados con el espacio”. Nuestro destino también es ir allá de donde venimos, sabemos que por ejemplo los átomos de nuestro cuerpo vienen del corazón de las estrellas,y nuestro hidrógeno del Big Bang. Estamos vinculados al cosmos y tenemos el privilegio por primera vez, de poder entender la historia del universo. Estos momentos de Eclipse nos permiten compartir este sentido de pertenencia, además del interés por la ciencia y la tecnología. TE PUEDE INTERESAR: Del cielo al lienzo: Los eclipses solares en el arte y la literatura Así que con el llamado de la danza cósmica entre los astros, decidí irme al desierto, guiada por Jacqueline L. Palma, artista digital, pero además una mujer de desierto, cada espacio que transitamos del territorio, lo conocía, me platicaba los nombres de los lugares, las reliquias, los mitos y leyendas.Una exploradora nata, capaz de ver los detalles, donde otros, tal vez sólo ven rocas y arena. Por fin llegó el gran momento, el sol irradiaba intensamente antes de comenzar la danza, la luz comenzó su tránsito. Cantó el pájaro, y yo veía de vez en cuando a través de los filtros, de pronto, en aquellas rocas, entre nopales, flores, y gobernadoras, la luna imponente miró directamente al astro rey. No puedo explicar la reacción del cuerpo, es algo que mientras les escribo sigue cimbrando mi ser, jamás olvidaré esa sensación. Cuando por fin el eclipse fue total, volteé a ver el cielo, ese anillo como diamante, las nubes transitando, esa imagen que tanto vi en la pantalla, frente a mi. Me supe pequeña, pero también parte de un gran todo. El misterio del desierto se revela solo frente a quién se entrega a él, y en aquél desierto, estoy segura, muchos volvimos a nacer como el sol.",

    "title": "The American Dream is collapsing, and it’s knocking billionaires off their pedestals",
    "text": "Whether it be Bill Gates or Elon Musk, Americans are starting to fall out of love with their billionaires. Though, as fellow high-net-worth individual Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook once wrote, it’s complicated. Amidst surging inequality, many Americans simply aren&#039;t buying the innate worth of the mega-rich, per Harris Poll&#039;s recently released survey of more than 2,100 U.S. adults. As privileged households’ finances balloon, so does criticism of those who hoard wealth. Of course, the nation’s founding myth focuses on said rich figures who climb their way to the top through hard work. But as belief in said American Dream wanes, many Americans are grasping onto a new goal: holding billionaires to task. Americans are increasingly trying to hold billionaires accountable, though hold mixed-emotions towards them. “These findings reveal a society that admires wealth but also demands greater accountability and equity,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer at The Harris Poll. “It&#039;s a call for a more balanced and fair economy where success benefits everyone, not just a select few,” she continued, explaining that while America is “obsessed with tales of overnight millionaires and ventures that promise substantial returns,” that shine has dulled as economic disparities widen. Indeed, Americans are increasingly feeling wary of billionaires’ growing net worth and its ripple effects. More than half of Americans (59%) believe that billionaires are creating a more unfair society. And said society is unfolding in front of our eyes, as a whopping 71% deem wealth inequality a serious national issue, especially BIPOC and Hispanic respondents. That represents a 5% increase from 64% in 2022, when Harris Poll last issued its survey. The one percent has had an especially good run of it as of late, as nonprofit Oxfam points out in its report, Inequality Inc. The five richest men’s worth has skyrocketed by 114% since 2020, while in America alone, billionaires are $1.6 trillion wealthier than they were during the early pandemic. And Fed data shows that payday is nowhere near reaching everyone equally. While the share of wealth held by the one percent has increased by a third since 1990, the share of wealth for the poorest 50% has plummeted by around a quarter, an Oxfam spokesperson noted. “People are understandably fed up with struggling to get by and being unable to cover their basic needs while billionaires flaunt unimaginably lavish lifestyles,” Rebecca Riddell, policy lead for economic and racial justice at Oxfam America, told Fortune. “Runaway wealth concentration at the very top and persistent poverty are two sides of the same coin, so it’s no surprise that we’re seeing increasing awareness of that troubling dynamic.” What’s more, most Harris Poll respondents—58%—blamed billionaires for accelerating inflation. Some 62% agreed that “America has become a backyard” for said rich people. While many (46%) Americans don’t believe in limiting wealth, even more suggest taxing the rich (69%). Younger adults are at the forefront of this movement, with 80% of Gen Zers in favor of taxing the wealthy. Even so, many adults hold mixed and perhaps even contradictory views on billionaires. In other words, despite souring on them, Americans still can’t figure out how they regard the rich. A fair amount say that billionaires are good for the economy (61%) and society (62%). This runs a bit against previous sentiment that these high-net-worth individuals stoke inequality and inflation, both which put dampers on the economy. And despite their mistrust of the richest, most Americans still dream of one day joining their ranks. While 39% of respondents report despising billionaires, 61% look up to them. Six in 10 Americans report wanting to be billionaires one day, a desire held most by millennials, Hispanic Americans, and Black Americans. That number has remained unchanged since 2022, “which highlights a core part of the American dream: the pursuit of success and prosperity,” per Rodney. Another growing sentiment: Since they have so much money, billionaires might as well be doing more. People are looking for billionaires to get out of the media and into philanthropy, as 71% report that the ultra-wealthy are not “doing enough with their fortunes to better our society.” Some 2 out of 3 Americans don’t think billionaires are taxed enough, and believe that additional money could go to programs like affordable healthcare, housing, and food security. More Americans are calling for billionaires to give their money to the common good than in 2022. “This shows a rising expectation for the wealthy to take on more social responsibility,” explained Rodney. “There is an inherent expectation, perhaps a moral plea, for those who have benefitted extraordinarily from the American economic landscape to extend their support to the broader community that furnished their success,” said Rodney. “This is not merely a financial imperative but a call to foster a more inclusive economy where the success of the few does not eclipse the potential of the many,” she added, characterizing Americans’ regard for billionaires as aspirational resentment. Americans have a lot of unpacked feelings, to say the least, when it comes to the privileged few that have immense power and money. They’re swallowing a tough pill, after all. “Trickle-down economics promised to deliver the American Dream for everyone,” said Oxfam’s Riddell. “Instead, billionaires have benefited from policies deliberately designed to reward the ultra-wealthy, and this resulting inequality has come at the expense of ordinary families.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",
