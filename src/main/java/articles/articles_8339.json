    "title": "Frontline report: Months of strikes set stage for latest missile onslaught on Crimea - Euromaidan Press",
    "text": "Today, there is a lot of news from the south. Yesterday, Ukrainian forces conducted a [concentrated missile strike on Crimea.](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/02/01/radar-station-likely-hit-in-ukraine-strike-on-belbek-airfield-in-russian-occupied-crimea/) The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that Ukrainian aviation launched 20 missiles in the direction of Sevastopol and claimed that all of them were intercepted. Local residents, however, reported hearing 6 explosions in the northern part of Sevastopol. Judging by the footage, the target of the missile strike became the Russian airbase [Belbek]. Some sources claimed that apart from the airfield itself, at least one missile hit the underground headquarters, similar to what we saw near Mariupol last year. [Radar station likely hit in Ukraine strike on Belbek airfield in Russian-occupied Crimea] The 31 January missile strike should not have been a surprise because yesterday, Ukrainians conducted a successful drone strike. Most of the drones were operating near Rozdolne, which is exactly where Ukrainians managed to destroy a Russian air defense system radar station. The destruction of the radar undermined air defense in this region and opened a window for today’s missile strike. And these latest developments serve as a direct extension of the much broader Ukrainian strike campaign in Crimea, which reached its peak intensity in the previous several weeks. In fact, connecting all these strikes together reveals an unbelievable scale and far-reaching implications of the operations because Ukrainians are not just aiming to destroy whatever equipment they can but rather exploit and exacerbate systematic weaknesses of the Russian military. First stage of operations: finishing off Russian Black Sea Fleet The first stage of the operation happened in the first half of January when Ukrainians focused their fire on the remnants of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. As you remember, Russians have already relocated much of it to Novorossiysk, causing the evolution of the Ukrainian goals. Nonetheless, Ukrainians did not want to reveal their new goals and designed the operation to make it seem like they were still chasing the Russian fleet. The strikes involved a lot of marine and aerial drones. Ukrainians even put to use the newest marine drones that were equipped with missiles and could damage Russian ships from afar. Interestingly, Ukrainian partisans from the Atesh Group recently revealed that one of the smaller ships sank in the bay, possibly due to this strike. Such development served as a great distraction, forcing Russians to focus on protecting the ships. Ukrainians reinforced this decision by launching anti-ship missiles from Odesa. In the meantime, Ukrainians detected that some of the drones managed to get very close to Saky without being shot down, signaling that there was a weakness. Second stage: exploiting gaps in Saky air defense Ukrainians immediately followed up with a comprehensive missile strike involving Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles, as well as various anti-radar and decoy rockets and drones. Based on the satellite footage, Ukrainians managed to destroy a Russian command post near Sevastopol, ammunition warehouses near Pervomaiske, and most importantly, an air defense radar system and a communications center in Yevpatoria responsible for coordinating Russian air defense operations. Russian analysts concluded that the real goal all along was degrading the Russian air defense umbrella. And this was correct because the destruction of the radars and communication centers created a massive hole in the Russian airspace, which Ukrainians immediately started to take advantage of. In a matter of weeks, Ukrainian strikes started reaching not only eastern Crimea but also [Tuapse](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/01/25/russias-black-sea-port-oil-refinery-engulfed-in-flames-after-another-drone-raid/), Krasnodar, and Rostov. Third stage: destroying A-50 AWAC aircraft In order to plug the hole, Russia began constant sorties of A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft. Moreover, Russian commanders ordered to fly closer to the northern shore of Azov to cover possible strikes from the north. Ukrainians noticed that the aircraft usually reached Berdiansk and relocated the Patriot system to launch a hunt on it. As you know, the hunt was successful, and apart from [destroying an extremely rare A-50,](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/01/15/russia-reportedly-loses-valuable-awacs-a-50-aircraft-over-azov-sea-updates/) of which Russians have less than 10, Ukrainians also severely damaged an Il-22 airborne command post aircraft. This temporarily created an even bigger hole in the sky, and Ukrainians immediately launched a series of missile and drone strikes. The targets became a chemical plant in Rostov, a massive oil refinery in Tuapse, and a speed boat factory near the same city. In Crimea, Ukrainians focused on Sevastopol and Tarkhankut and sometimes reached Hennichesk via the empty skies of Crimea. So, yesterday’s destruction of yet another radar station and today’s strike on the airfield is a continuation of this intense month-long campaign. In fact, the situation with air defense and strikes in Crimea is so dire that the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed that Ukrainians are making Crimea simply untenable. This is in line with the statements of Ukrainian military and political leaders. For example, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Crimea will become the center of some of the most intense battles in 2024. The Head of Ukrainian Intelligence similarly stated that Ukrainian forces will continue to press Russian forces through operations that target Russian logistics in Crimea and beyond. The continuous strike campaigns in the south are destabilizing the situation and preventing Russians from developing solid logistics. And it seems like the campaign will not stop as French President Emmanuel Macron stated that France will send 40 SCALP missiles, while the Pentagon stated that Ukrainians will have GLSDB rockets with a 150 km range already tomorrow.

    "title": "Powered by readers: How a Berlin newspaper thrives without a paywall | International Journalists' Network",
    "text": "“Free access to information is essential for a democratic society”, says Aline Lüllmann, CEO of the Berlin-based daily taz. die tageszeitung. In times of war, social and economic crises, rampant disinformation, and tech giants pulling the plug on fact-checking programs, her words couldn’t ring more true. Yet, in this dystopian media landscape, taz has seemingly carved out something close to a news utopia and takes a radically different approach: It trusts its digital readers to pay voluntarily – no paywall, no restrictions, “taz I pay” (German: “taz zahl ich”). And so far, 42,000 readers have committed and stepped up, many of them supporting taz since voluntary contributions began in 2011.\nThe average contribution size is six euros per month, but there’s others who give 150 euros on a monthly or yearly basis. This is how community is fostered, Lüllmann reckons: “We know our contributors very well. The taz team calls them regularly, they’re getting newsletters and are being invited to many events.” This has brought in around three million annually, accounting for nine percent of their total revenue.\n“We could not imagine introducing a paywall and economically we don’t have to”, adds taz’s editor-in-chief Barbara Junge. While the leading team doesn’t approve of the fact that more and more other media are raising paywalls, they also recognize that the competitors’ prices are approaching what their readers are willing to pay voluntarily. The New York Times for example offers a subscription for its European readers at eight euros a month, while German Spiegel Online prices its digital subscription model at six euros per week. But don’t be mistaken: taz’s regular voluntary contributors aren’t its subscribers. The left-wing paper relies on multiple revenue sources. Digital subscribers pay for access to a PDF version of the print edition, while voluntary contributors simply read the same online articles available to all and choose to donate to support the paper.\nIf you have less, you give less\n“Our information stands out from others and it’s therefore all the more important that it’s freely accessible”, says Lüllmann, emphasizing taz’s left-leaning perspective and its commitment to transformative reporting. This journalism is also reflected in the character of their readers and contributors, who pay not only for themselves, but also for others who have less – always promoting the solidarity motive of the newspaper on which it was founded.\nEstablished in 1978 as a grassroots alternative to mainstream media, taz. die tageszeitung has always been politically independent and collectively minded. In 1992, it took a radical step to secure its future by becoming a cooperative, owned by its readers and supporters. Today, 24,000 members ensure taz remains ad-free and financially independent, with each member having an equal vote – no big investors, no corporate influence. Becoming a cooperative member requires a one-time share purchase starting at 500 euros. Each member, regardless of contribution size, gets one vote in key decisions about the newspaper’s future.\nPrint and digital subscriptions are another revenue source and “solidary motive”, deeply ingrained in the paper’s history and identity, also carries across the pricing. Always driven by the idea that if you have less, you give less, because others will step up and make up for it with a larger contribution. Hence the “political price” as taz calls it stands at 62.90 euros per month while you can also sign up for a reduced fee of 41.80 euros without providing bank statements. Print subscriptions account for for 67 percent of total revenue, roughly 23 million euros.\nKeeping a newspaper afloat, navigating a media crisis, and paying fair salaries to 300 permanent employees is no small feat, especially for taz. “It’s not easy to afford an apartment in Berlin on our salary”, Junge admits.\n“Of course that’s not the norm but we do hear from some subscribers that they don’t even read us but continue to pay so others can and because they find it important that we exist”, says Junge, who co-leads the editorial team since 2020.\nConnecting generations to invest in the future\nOne small dent in taz’ utopia is that, like anyone else, their supporters are aging. Their average print reader is nearly 65 years old, so are their cooperative members. Even though their voluntary contributors are about ten years younger on average, the really young generations – we’re talking Gen Z and younger Millennials – haven’t taken enough interest into paying for quality news yet.\n“We recognize this and are running our first big cooperative campaign this year aiming to connect generations”, Lüllmann announces. The idea is that older cooperative members are buying shares for younger readers who would then also be able to participate in voting for the publication’s future. “When they turn 30 we will ask them if they want to take over the share and continue contributing”, Junge adds. Parents and grandparents can also gift younger family members shares and there’s an option to pay off the 500 euros in installments.\nBe a love brand\nNevertheless, veteran journalist Junge concedes, it is also the forms of produced journalism which have to be reevaluated to attract future generations: paperwise taz added a new “future” section to their weekly with constructive journalism at its heart, focused on “climate, science and utopia” in 2022. In 2019 they had already started a climate offensive to focus on young people’s concerns and livelihoods. The paper is also ramping up its presence on social media and invests in video content. Like this they have already been able to make significant gains, Junge says: “Two thirds of the people signing up for a subscription through socials used to come from our Facebook page, which is mostly used by an older age group. Now we see significantly more signups through Instagram which makes us think these readers are younger.” After the German election which saw significant gains for far-right extremist and conservative parties, taz offered subscriptions at ten euros for ten weeks. “Compared to the same months last year our share of readers in the age group 25 to 34 years of age doubled from ten to 19 percent”, Lüllmann proudly announces.\nAll the more reason for Junge and Lüllmann to stick with their voluntary and solidary model and push bold changes because according to them, the paper has never been as successful as in the past three years. Taz will seize its daily print operations starting in October, only offering digital subscriptions to the daily paper and a weekly print edition – although this might cost them up to 18 percent of current subscribers as surveys have shown. And: the paper’s income still heavily relies on print, accounting for more than two thirds of total revenue. “For some older readers it’s really hard to change habits”, explains Lüllmann, who will soon depart on a national tour together with Junge and basically the whole editorial staff in turns to assist people in making this switch they call the “page turn” (German: “Seitenwende”). The decision to deprioritize print was made because of rising shipping costs but made possible by voluntary contributions.\nBut could this model work for other media with a different founding history? “Even though we can be a tough read, it is still a love brand – if you’ve been with for us a while, you definitely have strong feelings towards the paper and I would say that’s necessary for the model to work – even if your paper’s DNA isn’t inherently left-wing”, the CEO summarizes. In the past there have been talks with The Guardian, which has adopted the same strategy since 2016. Yet, taz remains unique in how deeply its readers are embedded in its funding model – not just through voluntary contributions, but also as cooperative members who help shape its future.\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\nThis article was originally published by The Fix and is republished on IJNet with permission.",

    "text": "By Mohd Iswandi Kasan Anuar\nJAKARTA, July 3 (Bernama) -- The director of the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, was killed along with members of his family in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Tal al-Hawa, southwest Gaza City, on Wednesday, according to an Indonesian humanitarian organisation.\nThe Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER‑C), a Jakarta-based non-governmental organisation that operates the hospital, confirmed the deaths in a statement citing information from its local team in Gaza.\n“With deep sorrow, we announce the death of Dr Marwan and members of his family, following a direct airstrike on their residence,” a local MER‑C volunteer said.\nAt least nine Palestinians were killed and several others injured in the attack, the organisation said.\nDr Marwan, a Palestinian, was described as a “highly dedicated medical professional” who had served the people of Gaza for many years, particularly during repeated crises and armed conflicts.\n“His passing is a profound loss, not only to his colleagues but also to his patients and the wider Gaza community who knew him. May he and his family be granted the best place in the hereafter,” MER-C added.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a “heinous crime” against medical personnel.\n“Every crime against medical and humanitarian personnel confirms the bloody methodology and the premeditated insistence on directly and deliberately targeting them,” the ministry stated in a statement.\nThe Indonesian government also expressed its condolences and strong condemnation.\n“Indonesia expresses its deep condolences over the passing of Dr Marwan along with his family on July 2, and strongly condemns the Israeli attack,” the Foreign Ministry posted on X.\nThe statement praised Dr Marwan’s “service, commitment, and struggle in the name of humanity and for peace in Palestine,” and said Indonesia was continuing to closely monitor developments at the hospital.\nIndonesia reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to what it described as “Israel’s atrocities”.\nThe Indonesia Hospital in northern Gaza, funded by Indonesian civil society, has provided critical trauma care since 2016, with Dr Marwan playing a central role in sustaining its operations amid ongoing conflict.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2025 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",

Ele deu a declaração em Goiana (PE), em inauguração de fábrica da Hemobrás. \"Queremos um país soberano, capaz de ter uma indústria da saúde, porque nós temos o órgão consumidor que é o SUS. Que pode comprar as máquinas que a gente produzir, os remédios que a gente produzir, as vacinas. A gente não tem por que não acreditar que a gente pode ter um polo industrial na área da saúde para competir com qualquer outro país do mundo\", declarou o presidente da República. Além disso, Lula voltou a falar sobre inteligência artificial. Disse, dirigindo-se à ministra da Ciência e Tecnologia, Luciana Santos, que quer ver um projeto brasileiro para o setor até junho. O petista afirmou ter dado a seguinte declaração em uma reunião com a ministra e cientistas: \"Vamos criar vergonha, vamos ter uma Conferência Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em junho, e até junho vocês estão desafiados a me apresentar um projeto brasileiro de inteligência artificial para a gente não ter que copiar de outro país as coisas importantes que nós precisamos.\" Créditos Agência de notícias Produção e distribuição de informações, com o melhor conteúdo de notícias, vídeos e o maior acervo de fotojornalismo do País.

El crédito para la obra será de USD 43 millones. La canciller Gabriela Sommerfeld y Kelichiro Morishita, embajador de Japón, realizaron la suscripción del proyecto energético, en un evento que contó con la presencia de Antonio Goncalves, ministro de Energía y Minas; Juan Carlos Vega, ministro de Economía y Finanzas; y Fabián Calero, gerente de la Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC). \"Hoy, nos reunimos para celebrar la firma y el intercambio de las notas reversales que oficializan el contrato de préstamo para el Proyecto Geotérmico Chachimbiro, el cual indudablemente será el primero de varios proyectos energéticos de este tipo en el Ecuador”, resaltó la canciller Sommerfeld. El proyecto energético se realizará en el cantón Urcuquí, con el propósito de aprovechar los recursos naturales renovables de la zona, como una alternativa para no depender de la energía hidráulica, que se genera a través de las centrales hidroeléctricas. Por su parte, el embajador japonés indicó que el crédito contribuirá al fortalecimiento de las energías renovables y la mitigación del cambio climático.

    "title": "Father beats son as Stephen Kenny enjoys winning return to Dundalk",
    "text": "Stephen Kenny enjoyed a winning return to Oriel Park thanks to second half goals from Tom Grivosti and Mason Melia after his son Eoin had briefly threatened to spoil the party. This was just a second away win of the campaign for St Patrick’s Athletic and their first since beating Galway Utd on the opening day. While it is a huge boost to their hopes of getting back into Europe following their run to the Europa Conference League play-offs, the defeat leaves Jon Daly’s Dundalk rooted to the bottom. While this game in hand could have seen them leapfrog neighbours Drogheda Utd, the Co Louth club have perhaps more pressing concerns ahead amid local reports that owner Brian Ainscough is set to pull his investment just over nine months after acquiring the keys to Oriel Park. It’s a far cry from the heights Dundalk reached under Stephen Kenny’s reign with the former Republic of Ireland boss guiding the Lilywhites to four league titles, two FAI Cups and the group stages of the Europa League prior to departing for the international setup almost six years ago. This was his first time back managing against his old side but his return threatened to be spoiled when his son Eoin fired the home side in front after just 79 seconds. Dan Pike’s long throw was helped on by Hayden Cann allowing the 18-year-old to nod past Joseph Anang from close range. Despite that bright start, it was the visitors who had the bulk of chances to level in the period afterwards with Felix Goddard flirting with disaster on a number of occasions with Brandon Kavanagh, Aidan Keena and Jake Mulraney all going close to catching out the on loan Blackburn Rovers goalkeeper following unforced errors. St Pat’s finally found a way past him within 10 minutes of the restart as a free kick was headed down by Joe Redmond for his centre back partner Grivosti to hook the ball to the net past a statuesque Goddard. The visitors then hit the front on 68 minutes when Mulraney’s cross from the right was bundled over the line by Melia.

    "text": "Crime and Courts Man found guilty in connection to murder of Bradley police sergeant By Sun Times Wire and NBC Chicago Staff • Published 5 hours ago • Updated 2 hours ago NBC Universal, Inc. A man who was accused of killing a suburban Bradley police sergeant with her own weapon in December 2021 was found guilty in her murder by a Kankakee County jury Thursday after approximately 70 minutes of deliberation.\nDarius Sullivan, who was 25 at the time of the killing, was found guilty on counts of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer and three counts of endangering the life of a child.\n📺 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are\nSullivan shot Bradley Police Sgt. Marlene Rittmanic to death after officers responded to a noise complaint regarding barking dogs inside a parked car near a hotel on Dec. 29, 2021.\nRittmanic's partner, Officer Tyler Bailey, discovered the vehicle belonged to Xandria Harris, a person who was with Sullivan at the time of the killing and also faced charges.\nHarris was an acquaintance of Bailey's, and met Rittmanic in the hotel lobby and asked if any rooms were booked under Harris' or Sullivan's names.\nThe hotel employee sent the officers to room 308, which was booked by Sullivan, who was wanted on outstanding warrants for failure to appear in court and had previously fled from Bradley officers who had tried to detain him on the warrants, Rowe said.\nThe officers didn’t receive a response from the room after their initial knock around 10:13 p.m. About a minute later, officers knocked again — this time with Bailey loudly saying, “It’s the Police Department” and asking Harris to exit the room to address the complaint about the noisy dogs, Rowe said. Harris allegedly responded, “Yes,” and indicated she would be coming out of the room.\nLocal\nSouth side 16 mins ago 9 injured, 3 critically, in crash involving van transporting patients with disabilities on Chicago's South Side Dolton 49 mins ago ‘Obscene': Dolton homeowner gets $2,500 ticket for loose dog The officers knocked on the door at least three more times over the span of several minutes, telling Harris to come out, Rowe said. Each time, she responded saying she was coming.\nAfter about 14 minutes of waiting, Harris tried to squeeze herself through the door and close it allegedly in an attempt to prevent officers from taking Sullivan into custody.\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter . Rittmanic and her partner both repeatedly asked Harris to stop blocking the doorway, Rowe said. Eventually, Sullivan came around the corner in the hotel room armed with a 9mm handgun equipped with a drum clip, prosecutors said.\nAs Harris struggled with the officers, Sullivan pointed the gun and shot Bailey in the head, Rowe said. He then allegedly turned the gun to Rittmanic and shot at her as she tried to run away.\nSullivan allegedly chased Rittmanic down the hallway before pinning her against a door. Sullivan struggled to unjam his gun using his right hand and mouth while also trying to disarm Rittmanic with his left hand, Rowe said.\nAs the scuffle ensued, Sullivan called out to Harris, telling her to “cock the gun, cock the gun,” prosecutors said. Harris joined Sullivan, helping him successfully disarm Rittmanic.\nThe two then stood over Rittmanic pointing guns at her as she laid on the floor, already shot once, Rowe said. She begged Sullivan not to shoot her.\n“Sgt. Rittmanic was pleading with them to, ‘Just leave, you don’t have to do this, please just go, please don’t, please don’t,’” Rowe said. “She was desperately pleading for her life.”\nWith Harris holding Sullivan’s gun, Sullivan allegedly fired two shots from what prosecutors believe to be Rittmanic’s gun, striking the sergeant in the neck area.\nAfter the shooting, Harris handed Sullivan keys and told him, “You have to go,” Rowe said. Sullivan fled down the hotel’s stairwell before leaving in a vehicle. Meanwhile, Harris retreated to the hotel room, where she gathered her belongings and got her two children, who were in the room at the time, before fleeing, Rowe said.\nRittmanic, 49, and Bailey, 27, were taken to hospitals in critical condition, and Rittmanic later died, police said. Bailey remained in intensive care until late January 2022.\nSullivan was arrested without incident about 9 a.m. by the U.S. Marshals Great Lakes Fugitive Task Force after he walked out of a home in North Manchester, Indiana, a town about 35 miles west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.\nHarris, accompanied by her attorney, surrendered at the Bradley Police Department about seven hours after Sullivan’s arrest.\nDuring her bond hearing, Rowe said Harris “actively assisted and enabled Darius Sullivan throughout the course of the murder of Sgt. Rittmanic and [attempted] murder of officer Bailey, and she is equally responsible.”\nThis article tagged under: Crime and Courts on now 7PM: NBC 5 News Trending Stories Hurricanes Hurricane Helene now an ‘extremely dangerous' Cat. 4 storm.
