    "title": "Hunter MP Dan Repacholi's 2023 gifts: NRL, NBL, Melbourne Cup, AFL",
    "text": "Hunter MP Dan Repacholi could be the most popular politician in the country if his register of interests is anything to go off. An Olympic pistol shooter before entering politics, the first-term politician's love of sport has clearly continued into his new role judging by dozens of gifts from voters and industry representatives. This year he was given tickets to NRL, NBL, the Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix, the Matildas, the Melbourne Cup and the AFL grand final. He also received a Foxtel subscription for his office and a high-performance mountain bike. The Hunter MP was invited to multiple luncheons at Hunter Valley wineries, and two local artists donated artworks for his Canberra office worth a combined $2600. The Mining and Energy Union also allowed the Hunter MP to use its office space while his electorate office underwent a seven-week renovation. Mr Repacholi's benefactors provide a snapshot of the major industry within his electorate, with Linfox Transport, Australian Hotels Association, Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Treasury Wine Estates all bestowing gifts. The sports theme continued with Shortland MP Pat Conroy, who was gifted tickets to the Newcastle Knights and the NRL Magic Round in Queensland. Mr Conroy's love of rugby league crossed over into his role as Pacific Minister, receiving a Tongan national rugby league jersey from the NRL's Tongan development manager. The Shortland MP has spent a lot of time in the Pacific this year as the Albanese government looks to strengthen relationships with its island neighbours. The strategy appears to be working, with Mr Conroy receiving a wooden carving of an octopus and fish from the Tongan Health Minister, a carved wooden storyboard from Palau's version of the National Broadband Network and a framed shell money necklace from a developer in the Solomon Islands. Paterson MP Meryl Swanson got four tickets to Elton John's concert at McDonald Jones Stadium courtesy of Newcastle Airport Corporation and was a guest of Tabcorp to the Magic Millions VIP marquee on the Gold Coast. In April, she was part of a bipartisan defence industry delegation to the United States. The trip was funded by Pyne & Partners, a defence industry lobby firm owned by former Liberal defence minister Christopher Pyne. Ms Swanson also received a dozen bottles of wine from Treasury Wines Estate that went to the Parliamentary Friends of Viticulture, which Ms Swanson co-chairs. Newcastle MP Sharon Claydon got the gift of travel... and work. In April, she was among a delegation of MPs to visit Dharamshala, an Indian city in the Himalayas that hosts the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, which was facilitated by the Tibet Information Office. In August, she joined a delegation to Denmark to study the country's offshore wind industry, with the six-night trip covered by the Danish government. Labor Dobell MP Emma McBride had nothing to declare for 2023 on her gift register, which has not been updated since mid-2022. Politicians are required to disclose any gifts over $300 from the public and anything more than $750 from official sources, such as a foreign dignitary. ",

    "title": "Man Wearing Hijab and Lipstick Insists: ‘I am Muslim. Not a Fake Woman.’ PJ Media",
    "text": "What did anyone expect would be the outcome of teaching young people to hate their own culture and heritage? The Islam craze that began with brainless young TikTokers reading Osama bin Laden’s 2002 letter to America and praising it for its anti-Americanism and Jew-hatred is showing no signs of abating, even as it ventures ever more deeply into the flood waters of abject absurdity.\nAdvertisement The latest specimen of that absurdity is bespectacled fellow wearing bright red lipstick and a full hijab. In a video that began circulating Tuesday, he responds to critical messages in a voice that he does his level best to keep soft and delicate. “Salaam, everyone,” he begins, and points to a message that reads, “why they [sic; there is only one guy in the video, but no one knows how to use pronouns in this mad, mad age] cosplaying a female Muslim.” It’s a pertinent question, as the man in this video looks as if he had lived in a saner and healthier culture, he could have been a lumberjack or a steelworker.\n🤡: “One, I am Muslim. 2 I am not a fake woman, I’m a real woman… just as any other woman out there.”\nHe also supports surgeries & gender affirming care for everyone, no matter the age. pic.twitter.com/xICXWdmyZG\n— L G B (@L__G__B) December 19, 2023 He answers: “I just gotta ask, who’s cosplaying? See, cosplaying is when you dress up as something that you aren’t, or someone you aren’t.” Attempting, while maintaining his quiet voice, a tone of outraged defiance, he continued: “I am a Muslim woman. I wear what a Muslim woman wears. I dress like that. So who’s cosplaying here?” You are, buddy, but it looks as if you have already gone well beyond any rational appeal, and entered the realm of fantasy and delusion so comprehensively that you may never get out.\nAdvertisement And so he moves on to another message: “You can’t be Muslim and a fake women [sic]!!! Lol might want to read the torah! Just quit.” What the reference to the Torah, which is holy to Jews but not to Muslims, is all about is unclear, but in any case, the hijab-wearing man answers: “One, I am Muslim. Two, not a fake woman, I’m a real woman, just as any woman out there.” He goes on to insist: “We should have access to health care, we should have, you know, access to our surgeries, therapists, hormones, other gender-affirming care, for everybody, no matter the age.” So he’s a real woman, as much as any woman, but he needs surgeries, therapists, and hormones to make that clear to the world.\nThen, with an air of satisfaction as if he has hit upon a game-changing argument clincher, he says: “Let me ask you this: how do we classify sports? We classify them between men and women. Not male and female.” This is a tacit admission that he himself is a biological male, even as he insists that he is a woman. So how would his hijab and newfound Islamic faith go over in Tehran, Riyadh, or Gaza City?\nIt is likely that he himself thinks that he would be received with joy and hospitality, welcomed as an “ally” in the struggle against oppression. We live in an absurd age, and the ridiculous has become commonplace. This fellow is just a symptom of a much larger malady. He has been told for decades that Islam is peace and tolerance, and that those who say otherwise are racist, bigoted “Islamophobes.” He has seen Muslims play a key role in the Left’s coalition. So he assumes that Islam and Sharia are fully compatible with his trans madness. If he travels to a Sharia state, he will be in for a multitude of rude awakenings, but the only people who will tell him that are those whom he would dismiss as “racists” and “Islamophobes.”\n Leftists and Antisemites Are Discovering That Islam Is Just the Thing for Them\nA hadith depicts Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, specifying the punishment for homosexual activity: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.’” (Sunan Abu Dawud 4462) The “action of the people of Lot” is refers to homosexuality. In many Sharia-adherent societies today, homosexual activity is punishable by death, in accord with Muhammad’s words, and wearing a hijab and insisting you’re a real woman won’t get you off the hook.\nThe left today is addicted to fantasy. Men can become women and vice versa, there will be no adverse consequences from skyrocketing inflation or unrestricted mass migration, Old Joe Biden is a capable and competent president — the delusions just keep coming. Reality, however, has a tendency to crash through even the most persistent fantasies, often in a manner that the fantasists will find unpleasant. If this guy does go to a Sharia-adherent country, he’ll find that out firsthand.",
