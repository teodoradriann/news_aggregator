    "title": "Meet the CDMX architect transforming the Met's modern art wing",
    "text": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City recently revealed the design for its new contemporary art wing — a project in the hands of acclaimed Mexican architect Frida Escobedo.\nEscobedo’s design of the Met’s modern and contemporary art wing marks the first time in the museum’s 154-year history that a woman has been chosen to lead the design of a major wing.\nEscobedo’s planned design for the Met prioritizes accessibility, sustainability and seamless integration with the museum’s labyrinthine and sometimes disorienting campus. (Frida Escobedo/Instagram) Her vision reimagines the wing’s modern and contemporary galleries, doubling exhibition space to 70,000 square feet within the existing footprint.\nThe design features a textured limestone façade inspired by traditional Mexican celosías — architectural screens, or lattices — that blend influences from multiple cultures.\nNow to be named after lead donors Oscar L. Tang and H.M. Agnes Hsu-Tang Wing, the wing’s transformation will include expansive outdoor terraces on the fourth and fifth floors, offering sweeping views of Central Park and Manhattan’s skyline, in addition to connecting the galleries to the rest of the museum.\nEscobedo, 45, was tapped to lead the now-US $550 million project in early 2022 , following an extensive search by the largest art museum in the Americas and one of the world’s most prestigious. She beat out older and more experienced architects, major studios and winners of the esteemed Pritzker Architecture Prize.\nEscobedo’s portfolio also includes the design of the Serpentine Pavilion in London in 2018 and the upcoming renovation of Paris’ Pompidou Center.\nLast year, she was named the world’s 2024 Architect of the Year by Architectural Digest España (AD).\nAnother upcoming feather in Escobedo’s cap is the redesign of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, which was awarded to the Moreau Kusunoki agency in association with the Frida Escobedo Studio. (Pompidou Centre) “If the Met in New York and the Pompidou Centre in Paris have placed their trust in her talent, there must be a reason,” the publication wrote.\nEscobedo’s design for the Met prioritizes accessibility, sustainability and seamless integration with the museum’s expansive, eclectic, labyrinthine and sometimes disorienting campus.\n“The wing is in New York, yet of the world,” Escobedo said in a statement. “It reflects the global nature of this great collection and also draws inspiration from the Met’s unique surroundings.”\nConstruction is slated to begin in 2026 and conclude in 2030. It is part of a larger $2 billion overhaul of the Met, which also includes renovations to the adjacent Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.\nA rising star in global architecture, Escobedo studied architecture at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, then earned a master’s degree in art, design and the public domain at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. In recent years, she has taught at Columbia, Harvard, Rice and Yale.\nEscobedo was born in Mexico City in 1979 to a doctor father and sociologist mother, and as a youth was always drawing or making models, though she didn’t decide to study architecture at university until “the last minute,” according to AD.\nShe began her professional career collaborating with Alejandro Alarcón, a Mexican architect whose designs reflect Mexico’s the cultural and social contexts of Mexico. Together, they founded the Perro Rojo studio in 2003 (when she was only 24), then in 2004 designed Casa Negra, a house in Valle de Bravo, México state, that is mounted on four tubes above the ground and is celebrated for its dark, geometric design and integration with the surrounding natural environment.\nIn 2006, she founded her own firm, which includes a studio in Colonia Juárez, in the center of Mexico City, where she spends about half her time — when not traveling or working in her other studio in New York in 2022. One of her first projects was the renovation of La Tallera, the residence and studio of Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros in Cuernavaca, Morelos.\nEarlier this month, she was the subject of a 2,000-word article in the New York Times , in which Laurent Le Bon, the Pompidou president, said, “She’s not like those starchitects. She wants to learn about the story of the building.”\nEscobedo’s portfolio includes the annual design of the Serpentine Pavilion in London and the upcoming renovation of Paris’ Pompidou Center. Her 2018 design of the former — “a delicate exercise in concrete brick,” including lattice walls that “played with space and changing light,” according to AD — earned her international recognition.\nIn 2019, she was named an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and her studio was named one of the world’s “100+ Best Architecture Firms” by the magazine Domus.\nKnown for her minimalist yet poetic style, Escobedo draws on Mexican vernacular traditions while addressing contemporary needs. She has been labeled a trailblazer in the field, celebrated for bridging historical influences with innovative design.\n“Frida Escobedo’s extraordinarily inspired, deeply thoughtful and dynamic design cements her standing as one of today’s most relevant architects,” said Met Director Max Hollein.\nIn addition to the Met and the Pompidou Centre, she is also working on residential buildings in Harlem and Brooklyn.\n“The most beautiful thing about architecture is that you are always doing things for the first time in your life,” Escobedo told the newspaper El País last year.\nWith reports from Architectural Digest , Architectural Record , Curbed , El Economista and El País",

    "text": "Un adolescente muere tras sufrir un ataque de un tiburón en el sur de Australia Sídney (Australia).- Un adolescente, cuya edad no fue precisada, ha muerto este jueves a raíz de un ataque de un tiburón en una recóndita zona costera del sur de Australia, informó la Policía. El ataque ocurrió alrededor de la 13:30 hora local (3:00 GMT) en la playa Ethel, cerca del Parque Nacional Innes, en el estado de Australia del Sur, explicó en un comunicado la Policía de esta jurisdicción australiana. En un primer momento, las autoridades apuntaron que los servicios de emergencia habían sido movilizados hasta el lugar para atender a la víctima que sufría heridas de gravedad. Sin embargo, horas después indicaron que el varón, cuya edad no fue precisada, falleció por las lesiones y “el cuerpo del adolescente fue recuperado del agua”. En octubre se registraron dos ataques de escualos en aguas de esta región, con resultado de la muerte de un surfista de 55 años y otro que ocasionó heridas en la pierna de una nadadora que sobrevivió al ataque. En mayo, otro hombre, de 46 años, perdió la vida mientras surfeaba al sufrir un ataque de tiburón en una playa de la ciudad costera de Elliston, también en Australia del Sur, mientras que en febrero una adolescente de 16 años perdió la vida a raíz de un ataque de un tiburón en un río de Australia Occidental. Pese a ello, los ataques de tiburones contra los seres humanos no son habituales y, según el último informe anual del Archivo Internacional de Ataques de Tiburones (ISAF, en inglés) de la Universidad de Florida), en 2022 se registraron 57 ataques no provocados de tiburones en todo el mundo, la cifra más baja de los últimos diez años.

([KPTV](https://www.kptv.com/2024/09/26/captain-missing-6-rescued-after-boat-capsizes-columbia-river/)/Gray News) - The captain of a fishing guide boat is the only person missing after the ship capsized Wednesday on a river in Oregon. The Hood River County Sheriff’s Office along with other law enforcement agencies responded to a call of a capsized boat in the Columbia River near the mouth of the White Salmon River around 11:30 a.m. Officials said six people on the boat were pulled from the water and taken to shore. Two of those rescued were taken to the hospital. The captain of the ship was the only other person on board. He is still missing, according to Hood River Police. Investigators said the boat was a 24-foot North River fishing boat last seen in the area of the green navigation buoy near the White Salmon inlet. The sheriff’s office has not released the names of the people involved out of respect for the families. The investigation and search for the captain will continue.

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Lucknow | Updated: 12-07-2024 13:52 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 13:52 IST - Country: - India BSP chief Mayawati on Friday welcomed the decision of the Delhi University to reject the proposal to teach 'Manusmriti' to law students. Delhi Univeristy Vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh had on Thursday said that suggestions to teach 'Manusmriti' (Laws of Manu) to law students of the university have been rejected. ''Strong opposition to the proposal to teach Manusmriti in the Law Department of Delhi University, which went against dignity and honour of the Indian Constitution and its egalitarian and welfare objectives, is natural and the decision to cancel this proposal is a welcome step,'' Mayawati said in a post on X. ''The most revered Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar created the universally accepted Indian Constitution, keeping in mind self-respect and self-esteem of the neglected and women as well as humanism and secularism, which does not match Manusmriti at all. Therefore, any such attempt is not at all appropriate,'' the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said. The Faculty of Law had sought approval from the DU's highest decision-making body to revise the syllabus of its first and third-year students to teach them 'Manusmriti'. According to the proposed revisions, two readings on Manusmriti -- Manusmriti with the Manubhasya of Medhatithi by G N Jha and Commentary of Manu Smriti - Smritichandrika by T Kristnasawmi Iyer -- were proposed to be introduced for the students. The decision to suggest the revisions was unanimously approved in a June 24 meeting of the faculty's Course Committee headed by its dean Anju Vali Tikoo, according to the minutes of the meeting. Objecting to the move, the Left-backed Social Democratic Teachers Front (SDTF) has written to the DU Vice-Chancellor stating that the manuscript propagates a ''regressive'' outlook towards the rights of women and the marginalised communities and that it is against a ''progressive education system''.

    "text": "Offshore wind farm could be boon to two Groton businesses\nJuly 04, 2024 2:00 pm • Last Updated: July 04, 2024 7:38 pm By Greg Smith\nDay Staff Writer g.smith@theday.com Workers in the offshore wind industry, in yellow, emerge from the modular egress training simulator after it was lowered under water and rolled over and they had to swim their way out while at Survival Systems USA Friday, June 21, 2024 in Groton. The Groton company is one of two promised more work by a company vying for a contract with the state. (Dana Jensen/The Day) Buy Photo Reprints One of the four offshore companies vying to be next in line to add offshore wind power to the state’s electrical grid is promising more work for at least two eastern Connecticut companies.\nVineyard Offshore said on Tuesday that it has a memorandum of understanding for work with Groton-based companies ThayerMahan and Survival Systems USA, contingent on the state choosing Vineyard Offshore from the four companies that have proposed offshore wind projects.\nBoth companies have performed work for Vineyard Offshore, the company that developed Vineyard Wind — a 806-megawatt, 62-turbine wind farm under construction about 15 miles off Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind 1 lays claim to being the first operational commercial scale offshore wing farm in the country.\nThayerMayhan provided an acoustic monitoring system early on in the project for seabed surveys and acoustic mitigation and monitoring. Later, the company used bubble curtain technology to dampen the sound during installation of offshore wind turbine foundations.\n“Vineyard Wind 1 gave us a chance to enter the offshore wind industry and establish our Big Bubble Curtain business in New England. We are excited about continuing our partnership with Vineyard Offshore and Vineyard Wind 2,” Richard Hine, president of ThayerMayhan, said in a statement.\nVineyard Offshore also plans a continued partnership and has entered a memorandum of understanding with Groton-based Survival Systems, a company that is training people in the offshore wind industry in water safety and survival. In a statement released on Tuesday, Vineyard Offshore said the agreement with Survival Systems will “support the build-out of training facility infrastructure, equipment procurement, certifications, workforce training, and capacity.”\nSince 2020, Survival Systems USA has trained more than 1,500 people working for members of the Global Wind Organization, a nonprofit association of wind turbine manufacturers and renewable energy developers. Last month, the company celebrated its 25th anniversary in Groton and held a ceremonial ribbon cutting for a new building housing a 33-foot training tower.\nKeith Wille, program manager for Survival Systems USA, said his company has worked with numerous offshore wind companies — teaching everything from how to survive a helicopter crash to how to safely transfer workers from a boat to an offshore wind turbine.\n“We look forward to continuing our work with Vineyard Offshore on this new project. Offshore wind has become an important part of our business and Vineyard Offshore has become a great partner,” Survival Systems President and CEO Maria Hanna said in a statement.\nWork for both of the Groton companies is contingent on Vineyard Offshore being selected to construct the proposed 1,200-megawatt Vineyard Wind 2 project in the federal lease area 29 miles south of Nantucket, Mass. The company promises construction work in Salem, Mass., secondary manufacturing in Providence, operations and maintenance in New Bedford, Mass., and electricity delivered to the grid in Montville via New London.\nVineyard Wind 1 is jointly owned by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of Avangrid, Inc. Vineyard Wind 2 is jointly owned by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Iberdrola, through a subsidiary of Avangrid Renewables.\nVineyard Offshore was one of the four companies that put forward bids in response to a multi-state solicitation from Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Connecticut is seeking up to 2,000 megawatts of new offshore wind, which would be in addition to the 304 megawatts it is buying from Ørsted and Eversource’s Revolution Wind project, which is now under construction and will supply power to Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nAlong with Vineyard Offshore, Ørsted, SouthCoast Wind and Avangrid have submitted bids under the memorandum of understanding between Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\nThe state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection has said it expects to make an announcement in the third-quarter of this year whether any projects had been accepted to move forward with power purchase agreement negotiations.\ng.smith@theday.com\nComments are limited to 200 words in length.\nPost your comment Cancel reply We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that does not contribute to an engaging dialogue.
