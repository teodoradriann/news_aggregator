    "title": "Palm Bay man survives car fire explosion, runs into burning home to save pets",
    "text": "A Palm Bay man escaped a car fire on Monday and then ran into an inferno to save his pets.The home on Hallmark Street SE is a total loss, and the newly married couple is starting over from scratch.Blake Garrett’s BMW was parked in the garage, and he was sitting in the driver’s seat.When he tried to start it, he saw a flame spark from the hood, and the rest is history.The fire quickly engulfed the garage and spread to another car parked in the driveway. After Blake escaped the explosion, he didn’t run away from the fire. Instead, he ran inside to save what he could.\"I was sitting in the driver’s seat when everything kicked off,\" said Blake, showing FOX 35 around the home exclusively on Friday.He realizes days later how the flames could have been the end for him.\"The only way I can explain it is a miracle, really. Five seconds more, and I wouldn’t be standing here today with you,\" said Garrett.After narrowly missing death in the driveway, he put himself in danger again to save his three pets still trapped inside.\"I was just ripping through here,\" he said showing FOX 35 exclusively the route he took through the backyard into his bedroom.\"He ran into a burning fire and got my best friend’s dog and cat after almost losing his life,\" said his wife Elissa.She was home when the fire broke out on Monday, but she’s thankful she can still hold her husband’s hand.\"It is a miracle that he wasn’t at least in the hospital,\" she said.Two pets made it, but sadly, they lost their 2-year-old kitty cat.\"Stuff’s replaceable, but you know it just tears your heart out,\" said Blake.The Palm Bay Fire Department says the car that caught fire had a mechanical failure and was full of fuel which added to the severity of the blaze.Blake says it was a freak accident he probably shouldn’t have survived.\"I believe the hand of God was there to keep the flames off of me,\" he said. \"I walked away with a little bit of singed leg hair.\"Elissa posted their story on Facebook, and the support’s been overwhelming for the newly married couple.\"I’m just eternally grateful for such a wonderful community we live in,\" the couple said with gratitude.Clothes, donations and messages from perfect strangers are now helping the couple process the loss and move forward from the flames.The list of community organizations that have stepped in to help includes CenterPointe Church, East Coast Christian Center, Holy Trinity Episcopal, American Legion Post 394, and Royal Palm Charter School.As for the cause of the fire, it&apos;s unknown to Blake and the fire department, who say, they have no reason to investigate any further.The couple started a GoFundMe to help them rebuild.",

    "title": "'Giant' creature was lost to science for 126 years. It's just been found in Madagascar",
    "text": "When a new species is discovered in the depths of the rainforest or on top of a mountain, it can be years before the creature is cataloged again.\nSeparated from science by elevation, water or tangled branches, the species lives undisturbed, its populations existing in an almost-separate world.\nSometimes, so much time passes, scientists can’t be sure whether the animals still exist. That’s when they send out an expedition.\nRe:wild, a project funded by anti-extinction laboratory Colossal, is working to rediscover these species “lost to science,” according to a July 17 news release.\nThis includes species that aren’t extinct and may have been observed by local communities, but they have not been identified in a scientific study for an extended period of time.\nIn a recent expedition to Makira, the largest rainforest in Madagascar, researchers, entomologists and trail guides searched the trees, ground and rivers for 30 different “lost” species, according to the release.\n“In the past the Search for Lost Species has primarily looked for one or two species on each expedition, but there are now 4,300 species that we know of around the world that have not been documented in a decade or more,” Christina Biggs, a Re:wild officer, said.\n“Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot and Makira is an underexplored area within the country, so we decided to pilot a new model for lost species searches there. We convened a group of scientists to search for as many species as possible, and it proved successful.”\nOf the 30 species on the need-to-find list, there were three mammals, three fish, seven reptiles, 12 insects and five spiders, according to the release.\nThey searched for five days before local guides and fishers helped to identify all three fish species. The guides walked for days to local communities and discovered a Makira rainbow fish that was brought back to camp, as well as photos of a fish with “iridescent scales and red highlights,” according to the release.\n The team also rediscovered several species of insects, some of which weren’t on the initial list, before something “most unexpected” caught their eye.\n“I personally was most surprised and pleased by the fact that the giant millipede Spirostreptus sculptus, not uncommon in Makira Forest, appeared to be another lost species known only from the type specimen described in 1897,” entomologist Dmitry Telnov said. “The longest specimen of this species we observed in Makia was a really gigantic female measuring (10.8 inches) long.”\nSpirostreptus species can live up to five years and regularly reach longer than six inches, according to Ant’s Kingdom. They are also called “olive-striped” millipedes.\nDespite 21 species being rediscovered, many couldn’t be confirmed.\nThe Masoala fork-marked lemur, not documented since 2004, evaded the research team, as well as a large chameleon species missing since 2006, according to the release.\nA dusky tetraka, a type of bird rediscovered on another expedition in December 2022, lives on both sides of Makira, and researchers were hoping to find it in the forest, but were unsuccessful, researchers said.\n“Though Makira is the largest forest in Madagascar, it is still facing pressure from agriculture,” Re:wild said. “The expedition team worries that species in the underexplored forest could face steep population declines before scientists have an opportunity to study them.”\nThe Makira forest is in northeastern Madagascar, an island nation off the east coast of Mozambique.",

    "text": "Italy bears severest weather on record in 2023: reports ROME -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday. According to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths. On the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula. In its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat. Legambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia. Among the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said. Much of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy. Meanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side.",
