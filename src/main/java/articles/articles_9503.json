    "text": "By Olivia Land ,\n5 hours ago\nA Massachusetts mom-to-be was stabbed to death hours after accusing her boyfriend of punching her in her pregnant belly — allegedly by the boyfriend’s homeless brother, whom they’d taken in, according to authorities.\nBrianna Welsh, 25, was found dead with “multiple sharp force” injuries at her home in Lynn on July 31, according to the Essex County District Attorney’s Office . She was around three months pregnant at the time.\nBrianna Welsh, 25, was fatally stabbed in her own home. Brianna Welsh/Facebook Just a day earlier, the mom-to-be called 911 accusing her boyfriend, Brendan Vozzella, of punching her in the stomach, NBC10 reported.\nVozzella, 24, was arrested around 2 p.m. — and held overnight — while Welsh was treated at a nearby hospital.\nShe returned around 6:15 p.m. to their apartment — when officials believe Brendan’s 26-year-old brother, Zachary Vozzella, stabbed her to death before fleeing, prosecutors said.\n‘Disgruntled client’ stabs 17-year-old volunteer at NYC soup kitchen in spat possibly over juice: cops\nZachary Vozzella was homeless and staying with the couple at the time, Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall said in court last week.\nZachary Vozzella has been charged with the brutal murder of his brother’s girlfriend. WHDH Welsh’s body was discovered on the floor of her bedroom the next day when her mother asked building maintenance to check on her, NBC10 explained.\nShe had cuts to her neck, legs and abdominal area, prosecutors said, according to MassLive . Her boyfriend was in custody at the time.\nBrianna Welsh called 911 on her boyfriend Brendan Vozzella one day before her body was found. Brianna Welsh/Facebook The brother, Zachary, initially claimed that he’d been at a Dunkin’ Donuts all day. But when investigators proved that wasn’t true, he admitted that he went to his brother’s apartment between 2 and 8:30 p.m. — but claimed he did’t see Welsh, NBC10 said.\nInvestigators later found Welsh’s key fob in a backpack at a relative’s home where Zachary was also staying, along with clothes and a knife that tested positive for blood.\nNYC stabbing spree leaves two wounded as homeless suspect caught hiding under subway platform: sources\nKey fob data proved that Welsh used her key around 6:15 p.m. on the evening she was last seen, and that whoever last left the apartment was gone by about 8:30 p.m., investigators said.\nVideo footage also showed Zachary going to his other relative’s home with a backpack and a trash bag in tow.\nZachary Vozzella pleaded not guilty on Aug. 1 to one count of murder and one count of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, the DA’s office said.\nKey fob data showed that Brianna Welsh returned to her apartment by 6:15 p.m. July 30. WHDH He is being held without bail pending a probable cause hearing on Sept. 10.\nDuring the court proceedings last week, MacDougal said there was “some indication” that Welsh had wanted Zachary to move out of the apartment before she died.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nZachary’s lawyer, Francisco Napolitano, told WHDH that his client insisted he did not kill Welsh.\nBrendan Vozzella was arraigned on charges of assault and battery on a pregnant victim and assault and battery on a family member on Wednesday.\nJudge Ina Howard-Hogan deemed him a danger to the community and ordered for him to be held for the next 120 days, MassLive reported.\n“The tragic violence that has taken the life of Brianna Welsh and her unborn child has created an unbearable loss for her family,” Essex County District Attorney Paul Tucker said in a statement.\n“While their loss cannot be repaired or remedied, I hope that our efforts to seek justice on her behalf assures them that we and the community support them.”\nWelsh’s family set up a GoFundMe for her funeral expenses, which noted that the mom-to-be was set to find out the sex of her baby shortly after she was killed.\n“Tragically, she has been taken from us, murdered in her own home. We are all lost without her,” the page read. “She was a bright shining star that went out before her time.”\nAs of Thursday, the fundraiser had raked in over $16,600 of its $18,000 goal.\nFor top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "With only a handful of days remaining until the end of the year, we are confident that 2023 will be the hottest year recorded in Texas.\nWhat You Need To Know 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded in Texas\nMany cities experienced their hottest summer on record\nHot afternoons and very warm mornings likely led to above-average temperatures, climate change likely the cause\nWhile it is too soon to tell if it will be just as hot in 2024, scientists say it is possible In an end-of-summer analysis , Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said the summer of 2023 was the second-hottest on record in the state with an average temperature of 85.3 degrees. This year fell short to the blistering summer of 2011 when the average temperature hit 86.8 degrees.\nFor some cities across the Lone Star State, this was the hottest summer on record. San Antonio experienced its hottest summer on record with an average temperature of 88.7 degrees. It also tallied the most triple-digit days at 64 and the most 105-plus degree days at 17.\nWe experienced no reprieve as we entered fall. In fact, many locations stayed hot through October. When you consider the steamy summer and warm end to the year, you have a historically hot year.\nBy the numbers Heat waves in Texas are becoming more common. In Corpus Christi, for example, eight of the ten hottest years on record have been since 2011. Nielson-Gammon says this summer’s extreme heat was evident in the triple-digit afternoon heat, but also in the mornings.\nAccording to The National Weather Service in Fort Worth , DFW broke its record for the longest duration of temperatures at or above 80 degrees this past summer. For 359 hours, North Texans couldn’t escape the heat.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at Dallas/Fort Worth International. While the summer of 2023 wasn't the hottest on record for the Capitol City, we were shy by only 0.1 degree from the hottest on record–2011. In many ways, 2023 looked a lot like 2011.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at Austin-Bergstrom International. For San Antonians, the average temperature for the year reached 73.0 degrees. This beats the previous record of 72.2 degrees set in 2006 and 1933. This previous summer was the hottest on record for the Alamo City. We hit the most triple-digit days at 64 and the most triple-digit days above 105 degrees at 17.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at San Antonio International. Is extreme heat expected in 2024? It is certainly possible.\nScientists will be paying close attention to El Niño . But this teleconnection that explains the relationship between the warmer waters of the equatorial Pacific and our weather in Texas is only one factor.\nTypically, El Niño brings more warmth to the Lower 48, but the current strong pattern isn't typical. With limited data and many other factors to consider, it's far too early to determine how hot the summer of 2024 will be or if it rivals the intense heat of the past year.\nOur team of meteorologists dives deep into the science of weather and breaks down timely weather data and information.

    "text": "Portugal.- El delantero portugués Cristiano Ronaldo alcanzó los 900 goles en su carrera, al marcar el segundo tanto de Portugal en el partido de la Liga de Naciones ante Croacia. El gol, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. El delantero suma 900 goles en 1238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting (5), del Manchester United (145), del Real Madrid (450), del Juventus (101) y del Al-Nassr (67). A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que ha firmado con la selección de Portugal. La afición lusa recibió el gol de Cristiano con su ya famoso \"Siuuu\" y coreó el nombre del delantero de Madeira, que para celebrarlo se tiró al suelo en la línea de fondo con las manos en la cara y una sonrisa.

Antes del partido de Liga de Naciones entre Portugal y Croacia, disputado en el Estádio da Luz de Lisboa, el presidente de la FPF, Fernando Gomes, entregó al exjugador una camiseta con el número 141 a la espalda. El ya exinternacional luso-brasileño, de 41 años, puso fin a su carrera tras disputar la Eurocopa de Alemania y es el tercer jugador con más partidos con la camiseta de las 'quinas', tras Cristiano Ronaldo (212) y João Moutinho (146). El antiguo central fue nombrado esta semana embajador de las selecciones nacionales de Portugal.",
