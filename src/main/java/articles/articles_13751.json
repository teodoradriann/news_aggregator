    "title": "These teens are learning to use fire to stop B.C. burning | Canada's National Observer: Climate News",
    "text": "Jaci Gilbert was only 13 when wildfire thrust itself into her life. It was 2017 and her community, the Tsq̓escén̓ First Nation, near 100-Mile House in the B.C. interior, was being evacuated ahead of flames sweeping across the territory.\nCommunity members piled anxiously into school buses to wait in nearby evacuation centres for the fire to pass. For some, concern about the fate of their homes and land was exacerbated because the buses and cots triggered traumatic memories from residential schools, she recalled in a recent interview with Canada's National Observer .\nGet daily news from Canada's National Observer Email *\n\"You're putting all of these factors [together] and it's like, “How do we not get traumatized by an evacuation?,\" she said.\nThe fire's impact on her community left her determined to learn how her people's ancestral cultural burning practices could help prevent a repeat disaster.\nCultural burning is the use of controlled fire to generate new growth and prevent large, destructive wildfires. Long used by Indigenous people throughout what is now B.C. and other parts of Canada, the practice was criminalized in 1874 and remains tightly regulated by provincial laws.\n\"[We need] more cultural burning on the ground ... [We need] to make the area safe from wildfire because of climate change. It's getting worse and worse — drier, hotter, windier — and the only thing we can control is the fuel.”\nHowever, as Canada suffers record-breaking wildfires, a growing number of Indigenous people and wildfire advocates are calling for those restrictions to be removed and cultural burning supported as a key tool to prevent disasters by reducing the amount of deadwood in forests.\n\"[We need] more cultural burning on the ground,\" said Joe Gilchrist, a member of the Skeetchestn First Nation and one of B.C.'s top experts on the practice. \"[We need] to make the area safe from wildfire because of climate change. It's getting worse and worse — drier, hotter, windier — and the only thing we can control is the fuel.”\nWhile Indigenous cultural-burning practices have been severely restricted by colonial laws, even the use of prescribed burns by industry and government to create wildlife habitat and tree plantations has plummeted since the late 1990s, fueling larger and more destructive fires. That’s a problem, experts say, with many calling for governments to support widespread cultural burning to mitigate dangerous wildfires.\nBut legal restrictions aside — and there are many — roughly 150 years of criminalization means there are few people who know how to practice cultural burning. It's a problem Gilchrist is trying to fix, most recently by organizing a canoe trip to teach Indigenous youth — including Gilbert — how to work with fire.\nWith support from Outward Bound, which provided canoes and guides, and Simon Fraser University's Centre for Dialogue, the journey saw Gilchirst and six young people from First Nations across the B.C. interior paddle and camp for a week in Átl'ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound , near Vancouver, B.C.\nTwo years in the making, the trip was canceled last year due to wildfires. Even this year, weather threatened to scupper Gilchrist's efforts as extreme July heat in the B.C. interior forced the group to relocate to the coast at the last minute.\nWhile Gilbert said she supported the shift, “we don’t want anyone to overheat,” she remarked. She hopes to one day learn from Gilchrist in the interior, where he best knows the land.\n“It would have been really interesting to see what he was talking about, around us,” she said. “I hope we can one day do it somewhere [Gilchrist] can really show us what he means on the landscape.”\nThe trip was meant to help \"the kids to change their mind about fire and cultural burning\" and teach them \"how the land was really supposed to be stewarded,\" Gilchrist explained. The group paddled a few hours each day, then spent the afternoons and evenings learning about everything from wildfire mitigation and firefighting to how fire can support traditional medicines and foods like huckleberries.\nHis lessons also focused on making Gilbert and her fellow students more comfortable with the flames and aware of what the B.C.'s fire-managed ecosystems looked like when cultural burning was commonplace. He hopes to make the trip an annual event, with the goal of teaching up to 30 youth each season.\n\"I was really happy with the response from the young ones. They're really enthusiastic about learning. They made it really easy.\" He added that the act of canoeing and the time it offered to connect with the land without cell phones — or even cell coverage — was also \"really great.\"\nAppreciation for the lessons and each other, without phones, was a common theme among participants who spoke with Canada's National Observer.\n\"This trip has been amazing — I loved every second of it. Even early mornings before I had my coffee,\" joked Maliki Williams, another participant.\nFor Gilbert, who also works for the First Nations Emergency Services Society, the trip left her brimming with ideas for future programs.\nWildfire fighting is overwhelmingly dominated by white men, she said, leaving scarce safe spaces for women and LGBTQIA+ people. Moreover, hiring practices have long favoured young and athletic people. Wildfire fighting agencies have also tended to prioritize short-term contracts, making it difficult for people to build a career in the field.\n\"It's so enlightening to see people be so open to learning about fire, believe that fire should be on the landscape and specifically stewarded by Indigenous people,\" she said. \"And now we're building these programs to [help make] our entire province safer. And hopefully, we can keep going into a national scope.\"",

    "text": "Believing that the [Eucharist](https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/special_features/eucharist/documents/eucharist-homilies_en.html) is God and adoring Him in what looks like a piece of bread requires becoming like children. Perhaps these simple prayers will help you to do this, as Jesus told us. These prayers are from children whom today the Church recognizes as saints or blessed, or who perhaps soon will be. Anyone of any age can pray them and listen to them easily. They express the spiritual childhood of those who recognize their littleness and trust in Jesus and his Church. That is why it’s easy to make them our own and let what we feel and need flow through them … because we’re all children before God! 1 BLESSED CARLO ACUTIS “Jesus, take a seat! Make yourself at home!” Blessed ( [soon to be saint](/2024/05/23/carlo-acutis-to-be-canonized-after-2nd-miracle-recognized/)) [Carlo Acutis](/2021/10/12/bl-carlo-acutis-his-life-his-miracles-and-his-legacy/) is said to have prayed upon receiving Communion. He used to say that the Eucharist was his highway to heaven. From the time he made his First Communion, he went to Mass every day until his death at only 15 years old. 2 LAURA VICUÑA “O my God, I want to love You and serve You all my life. I give you my soul, my heart, my whole self.” [Laura Vicuña](/2017/01/19/how-to-love-the-parent-who-loves-us-imperfectly/) wrote these words for her First Communion. This little girl offered her life in sacrifice to Jesus asking especially for her mother, as she confessed to Him before dying at the age of 12. 3 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDS OF FÁTIMA “My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love you! I ask your forgiveness for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope, and do not love you!” Francisco, Jacinta, and Lucia, the three little shepherd seers of [Fatima](/tag/fatima/), prayed this prayer on their knees with their foreheads on the ground, as they claimed an angel had instructed them to do. [This is what it’s like to see an angel](/2017/05/13/this-is-what-its-like-to-see-an-angel/) 4 ST. JOSÉ SÁNCHEZ DEL RÍO “Long live Christ the King!” The last words of the Mexican boy [St. José Sánchez del Río](/2024/02/09/the-young-mexican-who-gave-his-life-for-christ-the-king/) — like those of many martyrs — can become a simple praise before the Blessed Sacrament. 5 ST. DOMINIC SAVIO “I need nothing from this world in order to be happy. I need only to contemplate you in Heaven, Jesus, whom I now see and adore on the Altar, with the eyes of faith.” This prayer is an adaptation of some words from the personal diary of little [St. Dominic Savio](/2022/05/27/st-dominic-savio-the-four-resolutions-of-a-15-year-old-saint/), who spent hours in ecstasy before the Eucharist. 6 JOSEPH RATZINGER “I would like to be always with you … but above all, be always with me.” [Benedict XVI](/tag/pope-benedict-xvi/) made this prayer to Jesus the first time he received Communion, when he was 9 years old. 7 ST. THERESE OF LISIEUX “Living Bread, Bread of Heaven, divine Eucharist, soul-stirring mystery that produced love! Come and dwell in my breast, Jesus, my white host, just for today!” [St. Therese of the Child Jesus](/tag/therese-of-lisieux/), teacher of spiritual childhood, wrote these words which belong to a longer poem she dedicated to her older sister for her saint’s day.

    "text": "( MENAFN - EIN Presswire)\nWith a Powerful and Impressive Resume, Unparalleled Qualifications, Many Accomplishments, Unmatched Business and Life Experiences Goldfarb Is Very Formidable.\nDanger...It must spring up amongst us...If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its authors and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” - President LincolnHOLLYWOOD, FL, US, July 11, 2024 /EINPresswire / -- Eddie Goldfarb, describes himself as the first \"Constitutional Independent\" running against incumbent Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Goldfarb would also be the first write-in candidate to be elected to a federal office in Florida and the most senior congressional member elected to a Congressional seat. He would bring unparalleled qualifications and a fervent love for America to Congress. With a distinctive, impressive career and vigorous spirit, Goldfarb will go outside the box when necessary to deliver on promises and will bring a fresh, out-of-the-box approach to representation.\nUpholding the Constitution and Conservative Values, Goldfarb asserts his undying commitment to the Constitution, recalling his oath as a Naval Officer to protect it against all enemies, foreign and domestic. \"My oath is as enforced today as it was then.\"\nWith the ability to remove himself and his bias, he can view matters objectively. He's fiscally moderate and advocates for re-centering social issues to a rational, sane middle ground. Unaligned with any political party, pledging his loyalty to the will of the majority and the Constitution. \"I can't be intimidated, bought, sold, or compromised. My campaign is about re-centering America and restoring its Constitutional values.\"\nGoldfarb defies age with boundless energy. At 79, Goldfarb is the epitome of the adage, \"Age is just a number.\" An imposing, powerful physique, fast reflexes, a sharp mind, and an infallible memory fortified by years of accumulated knowledge and wisdom, Goldfarb possesses tireless energy which enables him to work long hours, make sound decisions and solve complex problems. His diplomatic style will be invaluable in assisting him in relating to and working with his constituents and Congressional colleagues. Without question, he will stand out as an effective Representative as he easily draws on his common sense, street smarts, intellect and style to get things done.\n\"While I maybe the same age as Trump and Biden, I credit my physique, fitness, and mental sharpness to proactive healthy habits, which include a regimen of five-day-a-week workouts and healthy eating,\" said Goldfarb. \"My doctor recently describe me with the word \"incredible\"; I still do 40+ push-ups and 7+ pull-ups regularly.\"\nGoldfarb would bring synergistic energy, a diplomatic style, an impressive wealth of diverse experiences and accomplishments to the U.S. House of Representative, allowing him to relate to people on all levels and the asset of drawing from careers as a Navy Fighter Pilot, Deputy Sheriff, Senior Manager at Fortune Corporations, 34-year successful Realtor, Business Owner, Author, Entrepreneur, and Inventor. His startup company, SOPO Dispenser Corporation, underscores his ability to fulfill his promises.\n\"I've accumulated years of wisdom, knowledge, and common sense from accumulated life and business experiences. Experiences that helps me relate to all people, negotiate complex deals, and solve problems efficiently and effectively,\" said Goldfarb. \"My candidacy emerges from sheer frustration with current Washington politics. I'm fed up with the incompetence and lack of accountability in Washington. I firmly believe I can represent the people more effectively due to my unique qualifications.\nGoldfarb summarizes his write-in candidacy as, \"I would have loved to run a traditional campaign, but I was faced with the choice of gathering 7,000 signatures in a few days or paying over $7,000 to appear on the ballot. My only choice was the write-in route. \"When I was young, liberal and naive, I would say to myself, oh, I recognize that name and I voted by name recognition, only without knowing what was behind the name. Same holds today. Too many people cast their vote on name recognition without knowing anything about the person behind the name. I may not have hundreds of thousands of flyers, thousands of signs, or dozens of television commercials, but I do have a solid mission, and my life and business experiences, qualifications and character behind my name. Despite not having a million dollar plus war chest, I'm hoping for voters to look beyond the signs, commercials, flyers and for news networks, anchors, commentators and look to grassroots support. My message is clear and powerful, \"I want America re-centered, returned to the people and legislation passed to make it a crime for a media outlet or politician to lie, deceive, manipulate or propagandized the public.\n.Edward Goldfarb 0\nGoldfarb For U.S. Congress\n+1 954-605-8427\nemail us here\nVisit us on social media:\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nMENAFN11072024003118003196ID1108432629",

    "text": "Trauernder Witwer von Anita Kupsch offenbart: „Hat mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“\nNach jahrelanger Krankheit verstarb Schauspielerin Anita Kupsch mit 85 Jahren. Ihr Mann erzählt nun von den letzten Tagen, die sie miteinander teilten.\nBerlin – Als Arzthelferin Gabi Köhler in der ARD-Vorabendserie „Praxis Bülowbogen“ zauberte sich Anita Kupsch (†85) in die Herzen der Zuschauer. In ihren letzten Lebensjahren kämpfte die Schauspielerin unter anderem gegen Demenz und wurde liebevoll von ihrem Mann Klaus-Detlef Krahn (79) gepflegt. Der trauernde Witwer spricht nun über die letzten Tage, die er mit seiner Frau verbrachte.\nMann von Anita Kupsch war ihr wichtigster Halt\nAm 3. Juli starb Anita Kupsch in einer Berliner Pflegeeinrichtung. „Sie hat sich ja nur noch gequält und war ganz abgemagert“, offenbarte ihr Mann am Tag ihres Todes im Gespräch mit Bild. Beide waren ab 1987 verheiratet, für den TV-Star war es die zweite Ehe. Das plötzliche Ableben von Anita Kupsch kam für den Innenausstatter jedoch nicht unerwartet: „Es war absehbar, aber wenn es dann soweit ist, tut es unfassbar weh.“\nJahrelang pflegte Klaus-Detlef seine Anita, war ihre größte Stütze. Auch während ihrer Zeit in der Pflegeeinrichtung stand er ihr immer zur Seite. Er besuchte sie jeden Tag, so der Witwer gegenüber Die Aktuelle. Die letzten Tage mit seiner Liebsten waren aber auch für ihn nicht einfach – wegen der Demenz „hat sie mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“, verrät er mit Tränen in den Augen.\nNicht nur Anita Kupsch: Witwer trauert um weiteres Familienmitglied\nAufgrund der Krankheit hatte Anita Kupsch lange zu leiden. „Die Demenz ist eine ganz schreckliche Krankheit“, klagt Klaus-Detlef. Seine Frau „war organisch in Ordnung, nur diese Demenz hat sie kaputtgemacht“. Für den Witwer ist der Tod seiner geliebten Frau aber nicht der einzige Verlust. „Erst am 7. Mai musste ich von meinem Bruder Abschied nehmen und jetzt von meiner Frau“, offenbarte er Bild.\nIn diesem Jahr mussten sich TV-Zuschauer bereits von einigen Promis verabschieden, darunter von NDR-Legende Carlo von Tiedemann (†81). Kürzlich fand seine Trauerfreier in Hamburg statt. Verwendete Quellen: bild.de, Die Aktuelle (29/2025)",
