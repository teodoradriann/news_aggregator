    "title": "African Development Bank, World Food Programme (WFP) project boosts wheat production in war-torn Sudan amid soaring hunger",
    "text": "An emergency wheat production project in Sudan financed by the African Development Bank ( www.AfDB.org ) and executed by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has increased wheat production in the country by up to 70% in targeted project locations across five states within the past year.\nThe African Development Bank provided a total of $75 million to WFP for the implementation of the Sudan Emergency Wheat Production Project over the course of two years.\n“This development comes at a critical time for Sudan, which is facing a looming hunger catastrophe due to the ongoing conflict, that has slowed down production in the past agricultural season,”Nnenna Nwabufo, the Bank’s Director General for Eastern Africa region said.\n“Given the great potential that agriculture offers even under circumstances of active conflict, and with famine in Sudan on the horizon, threatening millions of lives, this project has brought a lot of hope.”\nShe added: “This year alone, 22 percent of the national wheat demand was met through the project. Its impressive performance has demonstrated that there are viable solutions to increasing domestic production to address the rising levels of hunger and acute malnutrition in the country. We are pleased that the scaled-up delivery of certified climate resilient wheat seed varieties and fertilizers to smallholder farmers in the target areas across the country was timely, and saved a number of lives, under the prevailing challenges of conflict.”\nMary Monyau, the Bank’s Country Manager for Sudan explained the scope of the project. “This wheat production project financed by the African Development Bank became the heart of production at this critical moment in Sudan. It provided food security, yielding 645,000 metric tonnes of wheat this year, and also became a critical crisis response intervention to the internally displaced persons,” she stated, adding, “More than 30% of the beneficiaries in the Northern State are IDPs”.\nShe went on: “The project was anchored on earlier game-changing wheat production initiatives under the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation project implemented in 2018 to 2021, providing a clear example of how a longer-term development intervention can meet short-term emergency and humanitarian needs with forward-looking resilience building. We thank our development partner, the World Food Program, for implementing this project and ensuring positive outcomes in at least 5 states, namely Gezira, Kassala, River Nile, White Nile, and Northern States, despite the active conflict in the country.”\nSummarising the scenario, WFP Sudan Representative and Country Director, Eddie Rowe, said: “The ongoing conflict in Sudan has had a devastating impact on agriculture. Sudan produced merely half the wheat it would have produced in a typical year. Thanks to funding from the African Development Bank, WFP was able to mitigate some of the impacts of this war on wheat production.”\nThe project distributed climate-adapted wheat seeds and fertilizers to over 170,000 smallholder farmers in the five states during the 2023-2024 agricultural season, covering areas largely located in the relatively stable northern and eastern states of Sudan where conflict has not yet spread, as well as conflict-affected areas such as Gezira and White Nile states.\nThe yield of 645,000 metric tonnes of wheat this year accounted for 22 percent of the total wheat consumption needs of Sudan. On average, farmers reported a 44 percent increase in productivity per hectare as compared to the previous season. Around 16,000 of the farmers who received support had been newly displaced by conflict in the last 13 months. The project offered support and resources for these farmers to rebuild their livelihoods. In addition, 12 harvester machines were provided to farmers' associations in River Nile and Northern states to enable them harvest more efficiently to significantly reduce losses.\nSudan, which is facing an unprecedented hunger catastrophe, risks becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis. A new WFP analysis has identified 41 hunger hotspots, noting that about 2.1 million people are at high risk of falling into IPC 5 (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) if they do not urgently receive humanitarian assistance.\nInvestments in agricultural productivity in Sudan are critical to increasing crop yields and food availability in the face of devastating levels of violence and hunger.\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB).\nContacts:\nJoyce Mulama\nCommunication and External Relations\nemail: media@afdb.org\nTechnical contact:\nMaurice Wanyama\n+254722370853\nemail: m.wanyama@afdb.org",

    "text": "Firefighters prevent explosion during TN house fire with 20 lbs. of gunpowder in garage\nThere are simple steps people should take to protect their weapons and explosives during a fire, officials said.\nROBERTSON COUNTY, Tenn. (WSMV) - Quick work by firefighters averted a highly dangerous situation in Robertson County when a home caught fire with explosives inside.\nPleasant View Volunteer Fire Department Lt. Drew Akin said they were called to the home along Stroudville Road on Wednesday evening that had multiple guns, ammunition and 20 lbs. of gunpowder inside.\nPhotos from our partners at Smokey Barn News showed flames shooting out of the attic of the home when firefighters first arrived on scene.\nThe owner told WSMV off camera he was asleep when the smoke alarms started going off. He grabbed their cats and ran outside to call 911.\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: TN home damaged in fire that left one injured\nAkin said he sent a crew into the garage first because that’s where the gunpowder was being stored. They then worked towards the other areas of the house that were on fire to prevent an explosion.\n“The structure will likely be a loss, but like I told the family, they’ll be able to at least get inside and get some things out,” Akin said. “A lot of people don’t have that opportunity. I’m proud of the work that our team did.”\nHere are instructions on how to watch WSMV4 live on various platforms.\nFirefighters are used to dealing with guns and bullets going off in homes, but Akin said it is very important for people to have them stored properly. Explosives only further fuel a fire and pose a risk for crews in a house.\nThis family helped firefighters by having much of their weapons secured in safes and closing doors before they went outside. The door to the garage was covered with black smoke and char marks but was not burnt through.\n“Definitely close the doors in your house,” Akin said. “I know it’s crazy. The house I live in, we try to keep the doors open to keep the air circulating. It can be tough especially when you are sleeping at night, but you’ve got to close those doors. Closing the doors could potentially save your life and it can stop the spread of the fire and the smoke.”\nAkin said people should also consider storing explosives somewhere outside of their main house, so they are insulated and have more time for firefighters to get to them.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV.

    "title": "Air Canada se enfrenta a fuerte negociación con sus pilotos que podría paralizar los vuelos | La Nación",
    "text": "La aerolínea Air Canada mantiene en curso un proceso de negociación con su sindicato de pilotos, el cual, de fracasar, podría llevar a la cancelación de vuelos que afectaría a 110.000 clientes de la compañía en todo el mundo, a partir del próximo domingo, según confirmó la empresa por medio de un comunicado. El pasado lunes, Air Canada informó de que se prepara para suspender la mayor parte de sus vuelos, en medio de negociaciones que se encuentran cerca del estancamiento con sus pilotos. La aerolínea calificó las exigencias del sindicato como “reivindicaciones salariales excesivas”. Ahora, la compañía solicitó al Gobierno canadiense que ordene un arbitraje vinculante para evitar una interrupción significativa de los viajes aéreos en caso de que las negociaciones fracasen. Hasta el momento, han transcurrido 100 días de reuniones entre la empresa y la Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas (ALPA, por sus siglas en inglés), que representa a 5.200 pilotos de Air Canada. Según la aerolínea, ha ofrecido aumentos salariales sin precedentes, pero el sindicato los ha rechazado, exigiendo públicamente los niveles salariales vigentes en Estados Unidos, lo que ha bloqueado las negociaciones. Según reportó el medio Toronto Star, en un gráfico proporcionado por el sindicato se logran apreciar diferencias salariales importantes a través de la frontera de ambos países, con pilotos estadounidenses que llegan a ganar más del doble que sus homólogos de Air Canada en algunas categorías. Incluso donde la brecha es menor, existen amplias diferencias, dice el informe: para los capitanes con 12 años de experiencia volando Boeing 777, los pilotos de United, Delta y American Airlines ganan un 76% más en salario que homólogos de Air Canada. LEA MÁS: Llegada de turistas de Estados Unidos y Canadá compensa caídas en mercados de Europa y Suramérica La Nación consultó a Air Canada si la posible afectación de sus vuelos impactaría las operaciones en Costa Rica. El pasado martes, la aerolínea respondió que, hasta el momento, estaban preparando planes de contingencia, pero que no contaban con más detalles para compartir. De acuerdo con datos del Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (ICT), hasta agosto de 2024, Costa Rica recibió por vía aérea 184.749 turistas canadienses, quienes en su mayoría visitan el país entre noviembre y abril. Según información del Itinerario de Vuelos del ICT, para este 2024, Air Canda ofreció vuelos directos desde Montreal y Toronto, con llegadas al aeropuerto Daniel Oduber y al Juan Santamaría. Sin embargo, la dinámica es distinta según la temporada de turismo. Por ejemplo, entre enero y marzo, meses de temporada alta, la ruta entre Montreal y Liberia tiene una frecuencia de cuatro vuelos semanales, mientras que la conexión con el Santamaría era de tres veces por semana. Los viajes entre Toronto y Costa Rica (tanto a Liberia como a San José) eran diarios. Para setiembre, la aerolínea disminuyó considerablemente sus vuelos hacia Costa Rica, de acuerdo con el documento del ICT. Este mes solamente ofrece tres viajes directos entre Toronto y San José, los días martes, jueves y sábado. Tras una consulta de La Nación, el ICT informó de que hizo un seguimiento con la aerolínea y los dos aeropuertos internacionales de Costa Rica, y que hasta el momento no se reporta afectación para el país, dado que los vuelos se mantienen según la programación original. Sin embargo, la institución indicó que, si llegara a producirse una suspensión o afectación, tomará “medidas para mitigar cualquier impacto negativo y mantener el flujo de visitantes canadienses”. LEA MÁS: Air Canada planifica suspensión de vuelos por conflicto con pilotos Air Canada afirmó que comenzaría a aplicar la suspensión de vuelos una vez se emita un aviso de huelga o cierre patronal de 72 horas, el cual puede ocurrir en cualquier momento a partir del domingo 15 de setiembre. En un comunicado emitido este jueves, Michael Rousseau, presidente y director ejecutivo de Air Canada, señaló que las negociaciones están cerca de estancarse y el tiempo se agota, lo que pone en riesgo los planes de cientos de miles de clientes. “Estamos tomando todas las medidas para mitigar cualquier impacto, pero la realidad es que incluso una breve interrupción del trabajo en Air Canada podría, dada la complejidad de nuestro negocio a escala mundial, causar una interrupción prolongada para los clientes”, afirmó. La compañía explicó que las partes han mantenido reuniones durante 100 días en los últimos 15 meses, tiempo en el que se han negociado 1.110 temas. Durante este periodo, las partes acordaron provisionalmente modificar más del 70% de los artículos para mejorar y modernizar su convenio colectivo. Entre ellos, se incluyen un aumento salarial del 30% para los pilotos, mejoras en los planes de pensiones y en la atención médica. Además de Air Canada, tres aerolíneas más vuelan de manera directa desde Canadá a Costa Rica: WestJet, Sunwing y Air Transat, conectando con las ciudades de Calgary, Toronto y Montreal.",
