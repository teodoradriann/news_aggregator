El evento, programado para llevarse a cabo el 30 de octubre, fue suspendido de manera sorpresiva, según un comunicado emitido por el Pepsi Center. “En Pepsi Center, nuestro compromiso con la integridad, el respeto y la dignidad de todas las personas es inquebrantable”. Se puede leer en el comunicado. Chumuel Torres apoya a Adrián Marcelo trás cancelación de su show en CDMX El productor del show de Adrián Marcelo y La Mole, conocido como \"Bandido\", expresó en redes sociales su deseo de presentarse en CDMX y mencionó una supuesta censura por parte del gobierno y una empresa multinacional. Chumel Torres mostró su apoyo al productor y a los presentadores, comentando que ha enfrentado situaciones similares en el pasado y también interactuó con el productor en redes sociales. “V3rg4, pin... mamilas qué pedo. Lo mismo me pasó en varios venues pro-Morena en mi gira del año pasado. Chingao we. En lo que pueda apoyar, andamos al brgazo carnal”, escribió Chumel Adrián Marcelo respondió al comentario de Chumuel. “Te queremos Chumi, eres la hostia hermano!! Gracias x todo!!”, escribió Marcelo. La cancelación del evento Hermanos de Leche en CDMX, junto con la suspensión de otro show en Zapopan, ha generado especulaciones sobre una posible censura. No obstante, se ha mencionado que la baja venta de boletos, que no alcanzó el 50% de capacidad en el Pepsi Center, podría haber influido en la decisión.

    "text": "Holiday season could bring life-threatening injuries to four-legged family members\nPRINCETON, W.Va. (WVVA) -While the Christmas season is a time of giving, for your four-legged family members the holiday season can be life-threatening.\nOne local veterinarian says that this time of year visits to the vet office are heightened due to treats given to pets, holiday decoration dangers and changes of schedules.\nAlthough you might feel like your pet deserves a special treat from the dinner table there are major risks involved.\n“You know, just food off the table that we kind of treat our pets with, that we shouldn’t would be, things that are salty may be very bad for a dog in heart failure, fatty food from what, you know, ‘we’re not going to eat the fat, give it to the dog’ and that can cause pancreatitis and things. That’s very common this time of year, with the holidays as well,” said Gary Brown, Veterinarian for Animal Care Center and Willowbrook Cremations.\nFor Christmas decorations, while they can light up a room, chewing cords, swallowing decorations, or holiday plants can lead to burning mouths or obstructions.\n“We all like those decorations. I mean, they’re beautiful, but our pets also think they are. So, they can go after those things, just like any shiny object, so to speak, and so our options are a couple. One is not making it available to them. So, kind of keeping them away from that, or maybe use different decorations that are a little less problematic for our pets,” said Dr. Brown.\nTable food and decorations can be dangerous, but changing schedules and atmospheres can cause problems as well.\n“You may be traveling you may not have the normal things that you would normally take care of your pet with, and so that can be problematic. So, just think ahead and kind of, if you have to stand there in the middle of the room and just take a look, ‘what could they get in to, what could they get into,’ and that would be, that would be very beneficial,” continued Dr. Brown.\nSo, for your pets this holiday season, remember to continue giving them their normal treats in moderation, check decorations including plants and make sure there are none accessible, and when traveling, plan ahead.\nCopyright 2024 WVVA.

    "title": "Slam Corp returns $176 million ahead of proposed Lynk Global merger",
    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — Former professional baseball player Alex Rodriguez’s shell company got more time from investors to merge with Lynk Global, but has to give $176 million back to those opting to redeem shares rather than a potential stake in the direct-to-smartphone satellite operator. Slam Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $575 million by listing shares on Nasdaq in February 2021 to search for an investment opportunity, now has less than $99 million in its trust account following a separate batch of shareholder redemptions earlier this year. The high redemption rate is a blow for Lynk’s hopes to use the funds to grow its constellation — currently enabling intermittent texting and other low-bandwidth services to unmodified phones outside cellular networks [in three countries](https://spacenews.com/lynk-global-starts-initial-direct-to-device-services-in-solomon-islands/) — although extra financing could come from other sources as merger talks continue. Lynk declined to comment. Slam originally had until February 2023 to merge with another company and faced its first wave of redemptions when it extended this deadline to February 2024. Announcing [a non-binding letter of intent](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001838162/000119312523304043/d682221d8k.htm) Dec. 18 to merge with Lynk, Slam said it needed permission to extend the deadline up to Dec. 25, 2024, because any deal with the Falls Church, Virginia-based venture would likely close in the second half of that year. Investors representing around 87% of the voting power of Slam’s ordinary shares that took part in a meeting for its latest deadline extension supported the move, the SPAC said in a Dec. 27 regulatory filing. Those who have not redeemed their shares will get another chance to do so once Slam and Lynk finalize their merger and seek shareholder approval for it. SPAC redemption rates [have been high across space](https://spacenews.com/space-spacs-look-to-rebound-in-2022/) and other industries as shareholders jump on the chance to recoup their investment amid broad stock market declines in recent years. According to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a law firm offering advisory work on these mergers, the redemption rate for SPAC deals closed in 2022 exceeded 80% on average, double the rate for 2021. The average SPAC trust was over $320 million in 2021 but fell to just $248 million in 2022, the law firm added. Declines continued in the first half of 2023, with investors on average opting to redeem 95% of the capital in a SPAC trust in March. Lynk has not disclosed how much funding it hopes to raise from merging with Slam, although the companies have said they are working on a deal that would value the combined group at $800 million. The operator currently has three one-meter-squared satellites in low Earth orbit, and plans to deploy two more early next year via SpaceX’s next Falcon 9 rideshare mission. Ultimately, Lynk envisages a constellation of 5,000 satellites to provide continuous connectivity services worldwide through partnerships with terrestrial cellular operators. Competitors include SpaceX, which plans to launch its first batch of satellites with an experimental direct-to-smartphone payload Dec. 30, and Texas-based venture AST SpaceMobile, which is seeking more funds after raising $417 million by merging with a SPAC in 2021. - SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.

    "title": "Obispo Salvador Rangel reaparece en misa; fiscalía insiste en hipótesis de secuestro e identificó a un presunto responsable",
    "text": "Salvador Rangel Mendoza , obispo emérito de la Diócesis de Chilpancingo-Chilapa , reapareció este jueves 23 de mayo en una misa en la catedral de Chilapa, a casi un mes de su desaparición y posterior localización en un hospital de Morelos. “Oremos por el monseñor Salvador Rangel que lo teníamos perdido y afortunadamente está con vida”, dijo el obispo de la diócesis José de Jesús González Hernández, quien estuvo presente en la misa. Lee: Localizan con vida a Salvador Rangel, obispo que había sido reportado como desaparecido en Morelos En una breve transmisión de video en vivo, a través de las redes sociales de la Diócesis, se observa a Salvador Rangel en la celebración eclesiástica; sin embargo, no tomó la palabra durante todo el oficio. Días antes de su reaparición, el Obismo dio a conocer que no presentará ninguna denuncia en contra de sus agresores. “En ejercicio de mis derechos constitucionales, no presentaré ninguna denuncia contra las personas que tanto mal me han hecho”, informó en un comunicado el pasado 8 de mayo. Un día antes de la reaparición del obispo, Uriel Carmona Gándara, fiscal de Morelos, dio a conocer que ya identificaron a una persona que posiblemente esté involucrada en la desaparición del prelado. “Ya tenemos una persona a la que estamos buscando para cuestionarlo en relación a esos hechos”, dijo. El funcionario insitió en que Salvador Rangel fue víctima de un delito, por lo que continuarán con la línea de investigación sobre el presunto secuestro. “Hasta donde vamos, el obispo emérito fue víctima de un delito y vamos a dar con el responsable”, explicó. Lee: Fiscalía y Seguridad de Morelos se contradicen respecto a lo que ocurrió con el obispo de Guerrero; Episcopado pide no especular Carmona aseguró que la línea de investigación sobre el secuestro está fundamentada en investigaciones, informes periciales, videos, declaraciones y otros datos verificables. El obispo Salvador Rangel Mendoza desapareció la tarde del 27 de abril . Dos días después fue localizado con vida en un hospital de Morelos. Tras darse a conocer la noticia, el fiscal de Morelos dijo que una de las líneas de investigación era un probable secuestro exprés. Sin embargo, el caso de la desaparición y posterior localización con vida del obispo tuvo contradicciones de las mismas autoridades, particularmente de la Fiscalía y la Comisión Estatal de Seguridad Pública de Morelos. Las versiones respecto a lo que pudo haber ocurrido con el religioso cambiaron de manera radical, ya que tanto el gobernador interino de Morelos, Samuel Sotelo, como el titular de la Comisión Estatal de Seguridad Pública (CES), José Antonio Ortiz Guarneros, dijeron que no hay indicios de un secuestro. Según el titular de Seguridad Pública, el obispo supuestamente entró, de manera voluntaria, a un motel con otra persona. “Hasta donde sabemos entró voluntariamente a un motel, con una persona del mismo sexo, esa persona después se retiró”, explicó el titular de seguridad. Posteriormente, el gobernador interino coincidió con Ortiz Guarneros respecto a que no hay evidencia sobre un posible secuestro. “No tenemos, hasta el día de hoy, un solo elemento para determinar que haya sido privado de la libertad como tal; los datos que se tienen objetivos es que hubo dos retiros, de dos cajeros, uno en la mañana del sábado y otro en la tarde noche, pero no hay una cámara que haya visto que lo hayan privado de la libertad”, aseguró el gobernador. Con información de Amapola Periodismo El tipo de turbuelncia que sufrió el vuelo de Singapore Airlines es de las más peligrosas. Te contamos por qué, y por qué se estima que habrá más en el futuro. Tras 10 horas de travesía, el vuelo SQ321 de Singapore Airlines sufrió el martes una turbulencia extrema que dejó un saldo de un muerto y decenas de heridos. En pocos minutos, el avión se elevó y cayó repetidas veces hasta descender por cerca de 1.800 metros. Imágenes de la aeronave, así como de los pasajeros y tripulantes a bordo, muestran el impacto de la violenta sacudida. Las turbulencias son un fenómeno frecuente en los vuelos. Es casi de rutina que el anuncio que indica que debes ajustarte el cinturón de seguridad (además de durante el despegue y el aterrizaje) se encienda varias veces a lo largo del viaje. Sin embargo, la turbulencia que sacudió al vuelo que se dirigía de Londres a Singapur –y que se conoce con el nombre de turbulencia de aire claro, o en cielos despejados o CAT, por sus siglas en inglés- es un fenómeno extremadamente raro. ¿Pero qué son exactamente estas turbulencias, en qué se diferencian del resto y por qué son tan peligrosas? La mayoría de las turbulencias se producen en las nubes, donde hay corrientes de viento ascendentes y descendentes, según explica Simon King, del Servicio del Clima de la BBC, y exintegrante de la Fuerza Aérea Real de Reino Unido. Estas suelen ser relativamente leves, aunque en nubes más grandes los movimientos del aire pueden ser más caóticos y generar turbulencias moderadas o incluso severas. La diferencia de las turbulencias de aire claro es que ocurren en cielos despejados y claros, y por ello no pueden vistas con antelación. Este tipo de turbulencia ocurre alrededor de la corriente en chorro, un “río” de aire que fluye rápidamente y que normalmente se encuentra a una altura de entre aproximadamente 12.000 metros y 18.000 metros, señala el académico de aviación y piloto comercial Guy Gratton. Según explica Gratton, es fácil que exista una diferencia de velocidad de 160 km/h, entre el aire en la corriente en chorro y el aire circundante. Y esa fricción alrededor de la corriente en chorro entre el aire más lento y más rápido es lo que provoca estas turbulencias. Su peligrosidad radica en gran medida en que, como no se ven, para los pilotos son difíciles de detectar. No obstante, asegura Paul Williams, científico atmosférico de la Universidad de Reading, en Reino Unido, hay un gran porcentaje que sí es detectable. “Un 75% son detectables. Podemos predecirlas con precisión hasta con 18 horas de antelación”, dice. “Pero es ese 25% que actualmente no podemos predecir en lo que nos tenemos que concentrar”. “Ese es de algún modo la meta de mi carrera: acabar con ese 25% y hacer que se convierta en historia, para que ninguna aeronave vuelva a encontrase jamás con una turbulencia”. Aún así, reconoce que se trata de un desafío. “La turbulencia es el problema más difícil de la física y la física en sí es muy difícil. Estamos trabajando muy duro con la investigación sobre qué está realmente generando la turbulencia y cuáles son los mecanismos de esa dinámica”. El científico cree que se logrará, pero llevará su tiempo. Williams enfatiza que la muerte a causa de una turbulencia severa es una ocurrencia rara: la última que recuerda sucedió en 2009 y antes de eso, en 1997. Sin embargo, recalca la importancia de investigar el fenómeno dado que el cambio climático está aumentando la frecuencia con que se producen. “He estado estudiando las turbulencias en los últimos 20 años y en la última década hemos recabado evidencia de que el aumento de turbulencias severas ha crecido un 55%”, asevera el investigador. “Y, en el futuro, podríamos ver que se dupliquen o tripliquen en algunos lugares del mundo para la década de 2060, por el cambio climático”. Entretanto, la recomedación para los pasajeros es mantener los cinturones de seguridad abrochados durante todo el vuelo. Haz clic aquí para leer más historias de BBC News Mundo.

    "title": "Pelo menos 11 mortos em ataque israelita que atingiu escola no norte de Gaza",
    "text": "Um ataque aéreo israelita atingiu hoje uma escola que albergava palestinianos deslocados no norte da Faixa de Gaza, matando pelo menos 11 pessoas e ferindo 22, incluindo mulheres e crianças, informou o Ministério da Saúde local, controlado pelo Hamas. O Exército israelita confirmou ter atingido o edifício da escola situada no campo de refugiados de Jabalia, indicando que tinha como alvo membros do movimento islamita palestiniano Hamas que se encontravam no seu interior e que planeavam ataques às tropas israelitas - uma afirmação que não foi possível confirmar de forma independente. Imagens captadas da Escola de al-Faluja mostram as equipas de salvamento a retirar as vítimas do recinto, no meio dos escombros e de uma multidão. Um vídeo mostrava homens a envolver um tronco mutilado numa película de plástico e a colocar partes do corpo numa caixa térmica. O Ministério da Saúde da Faixa de Gaza não forneceu de imediato uma estimativa de quantas vítimas mortais eram mulheres e crianças. As forças israelitas têm repetidamente atacado escolas, afirmando que os combatentes do Hamas as utilizam como \"centros de comando\" para planear ataques. Os militares dizem utilizar armas de precisão para evitar fazer vítimas civis, mas os seus ataques têm causado um elevado número de mortos entre a população civil. Dezenas de milhares de palestinianos vivem em escolas apinhadas de toda a Faixa de Gaza, depois de terem fugido das suas casas devido aos bombardeamentos e às ofensivas terrestres israelitas. De acordo com as Nações Unidas, mais de 1,9 milhões dos 2,4 milhões de habitantes de Gaza viram-se obrigados a abandonar as suas casas e a deslocar-se, muitos deles mais que uma vez, durante o conflito que dura há quase um ano. Na cidade de Khan Yunis, no sul do território, as autoridades enterraram hoje numa vala comum os cadáveres de 88 palestinianos que Israel devolveu à Faixa de Gaza no dia anterior. Um `bulldozer` abriu uma vala num dos cemitérios da cidade e os corpos foram colocados dentro de sacos de plástico azuis antes de o `bulldozer` os cobrir com terra. O Ministério da Saúde de Gaza condenou aquilo a que chamou a forma \"desumana e imoral\" como Israel tratou os corpos, dizendo que foram enviados de volta empilhados num camião, sem qualquer informação que permitisse a sua identificação. Ao longo das ofensivas israelitas em Gaza, as tropas israelitas têm exumado vários cemitérios, bem como valas comuns improvisadas criadas em hospitais com os corpos de palestinianos mortos durante os ataques às instalações, e levaram um número desconhecido de cadáveres para Israel, afirmando procurar potenciais corpos de reféns ou combatentes israelitas. Israel declarou a 07 de outubro do ano passado uma guerra na Faixa de Gaza para \"erradicar\" o Hamas, horas depois de este ter realizado em território israelita um ataque de proporções sem precedentes, matando 1.205 pessoas, na maioria civis, incluindo reféns em cativeiro. Desde 2007 no poder em Gaza e classificado como organização terrorista pelos Estados Unidos, a União Europeia e Israel, o Movimento de Resistência Islâmica (Hamas) fez também nesse dia 251 reféns, 97 dos quais continuam em cativeiro, 33 dos quais entretanto declarados mortos pelo Exército israelita. A guerra, que hoje entrou no 360.º dia e continua a ameaçar alastrar a toda a região do Médio Oriente -- com uma segunda frente de batalha no Líbano -, fez até agora na Faixa de Gaza mais de 41.500 mortos (quase 2% da população) e de 96.000 feridos, além de mais de 10.000 desaparecidos, na maioria civis, presumivelmente soterrados nos escombros, de acordo com números atualizados das autoridades locais, que a ONU considera fidedignos. A contagem do Ministério da Saúde de Gaza não distingue entre civis e combatentes, mas mais de metade dos mortos são mulheres e crianças, entre as quais cerca de 1.300 com menos de dois anos. Israel culpa o Hamas pelas mortes de civis em Gaza, porque os combatentes do grupo operam em zonas residenciais e utilizam infraestruturas civis. O sobrepovoado e pobre enclave palestiniano está mergulhado numa grave crise humanitária, com mais de 1,1 milhões de pessoas numa \"situação de fome catastrófica\" que está a fazer \"o mais elevado número de vítimas alguma vez registado\" pela ONU em estudos sobre segurança alimentar no mundo.",

    "text": "Santa Cruz SANTA CRUZ La Iglesia exhorta a no abusar del poder y condena los feminicidios Monseñor René Leigue condenó la violencia y pidió a las autoridades seguir las enseñanzas de Cristo, dando testimonio y no abusando del poder. El obispo auxiliar Dowlascewicz dijo que la soledad es más cruel que cualquier dolencia física “Jesús nos da muestra del amor a Dios y al prójimo”, destacó monseñor René Leigue, arzobispo de Santa Cruz, durante la celebración de la última cena que se realizó en el atrio de la catedral. Repitió el gesto de Jesús que lavó los pies a sus discípulos, demostrando su amor con humildad y servicio. Manifestó que, con este gesto, Jesús nos enseña el amor, el perdón, el respeto a la vida y a la dignidad. “Perdona a tu prójimo, ámalo, respétalo (...) ¿Qué significa el amor al prójimo? perdonar, respetar la vida y la dignidad ¿Lo hacemos?”, reflexionó. Lamentó que hay tantas exigencias y problemas en la sociedad, y es triste escuchar sobre los feminicidios. “¿Por qué tanta violencia, por qué tanto desamor a la otra persona, por qué estamos insoportables? Porque no queremos que nos digan nuestras verdades y no queremos ser corregidos”. También llamó a las autoridades a que den testimonios cumpliendo las normas y no abusando de su poder. Recordó que Jesús, siendo maestro, se sentó y lavó los pies a sus discípulos, “y de esta manera enseñó cómo amar al otro, cómo tomarlo en cuenta, cómo considerarlo prójimo”. “Ahí está dando la muestra del amor de Dios que se derrama en nosotros. No hay amor más grande que aquel que da la vida por el otro y eso lo hizo Jesús”, resaltó. El arzobispo dijo que el amor al prójimo se muestra en el respeto a los demás y a las normas que ayudan a la buena convivencia. La misa se realizó en el atrio de la catedral, donde asistieron cientos de feligreses que participaron de la celebración de la última cena, en la que Jesús instituyó la eucaristía. Ayer, los actos religiosos comenzaron por la mañana con la celebración pascual para ancianos, enfermos y personas con capacidades especiales. Monseñor Estanislao Dowlascewicz reflexionó sobre el amor incondicional de Jesús con su muerte en la cruz y habló del sufrimiento que padeció en soledad, como muchos ahora la sienten con el abandono. “Puede ser que muchos de ustedes lo experimentan cuando los suyos, los hijos, los familiares los dejan a su suerte. El mayor sufrimiento no es muchas veces el dolor físico, sino sufrir solo, no tener a nadie a quien mirar ni con quien conversar”. Recordó que Jesús en el último momento de su vida nos trasmitió su amor aceptando la cruz y muriendo en ella. En Roma El papa Francisco llegó a la cárcel femenina de Rebibbia, donde recordó que, con el gesto del lavatorio de los pies, Jesús nos hace comprender la vocación de servicio y ante la traición de Judas nos recuerda que Dios perdona todo. “Jesús perdona siempre. Solo pide que le pidamos perdón”, dijo el papa en su homilía de este Jueves Santo en la misa celebrada bajo una gran carpa en el patio de la prisión. El Santo Padre presidió la misa en presencia de unas 200 personas, entre las que se encontraban reclusas, ex reclusas, personal penitenciario y algunas familias. La cárcel de mujeres de Rebibbia cuenta con 370 internas y es uno de los dos centros más importantes del este de la capital italiana. “Jesús se humilla, Jesús con este gesto nos hace comprender lo que había dicho: “No he venido a ser servido, sino a servir”. Nos enseña el camino del servicio”, dijo al explicar el gesto del lavatorio de los pies. “Pidamos hoy al Señor la gracia de no cansarnos. Siempre, todos tenemos pequeños y grandes fracasos, y cada uno tiene su propia historia. Pero el Señor siempre nos espera con los brazos abiertos y nunca se cansa de perdonar”. Inmediatamente después de la homilía, el Papa procedió a lavar los pies de doce reclusas, de entre 40 y 50 años, de Italia, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Ucrania, Rusia, Perú, Venezuela y Bosnia. La emoción era evidente en los rostros de las mujeres. “Es un gesto que llama la atención sobre la vocación de servicio. Pidamos al Señor que nos haga crecer a todos en la vocación de servicio”, insistió. Procesión con el Santo Sepulcro En la capital cruceña, hoy se realizará la meditación de las siete palabras, a las 12:00. A las 17:00 será la celebración de la pasión y a las 18:30 saldrá la procesión con el Santo Sepulcro por las calles del centro. Se cortarán algunas vías para el vía crucis.",
