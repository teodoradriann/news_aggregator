    "text": "PodcastHoy en El Debate\nLa burbuja tras el apagón: así se han encarecido las radios y los hornillos\nHoy El Debate hace una ruta por varias tiendas y establecimientos de electrónica en las que venden radios, hornillos, pilas o linternas para comprobar los precios y cómo ha subido la demanda de estos productos durante la última semana.\nAunque la mayor parte de los vendedores niegan haber aumentado los precios, algunos sí que admiten que lo han hecho. Si se compara en internet, los precios de las radios de hace unos meses con los actuales de algunas tiendas en el madrileño barrio de Chamberí, estos precios se han duplicado.\nUna radio Aiwa RS-44 en la glorieta de Quevedo la venden a 44,90 euros. Al buscar su precio, online es bien diferente: 26,95 en Miravia o 29,29 en Amazon, y si se hace una comparativa de su precio con el mes de febrero en estas páginas web era entonces de 22,99 euros.\nEn el caso de una Sanyo KS102P su precio en este mismo establecimiento es de 32.90 euros, mientras que en Correos Market la venden a 16,49 euros. En el caso de los hornillos con una búsqueda rápida en internet se comprueba como también han subido de 22 euros en los meses de febrero y marzo, a 50 euros esta semana en Amazon.\nAsí es la imagen unos días después del apagón histórico sufrido en España, subida generalizada de precios de los productos de subsistencia y una amplia demanda tanto online como en las propias tiendas.\nEpisodios anteriores\nHoy en El Debate - 04:30\n¿Tiene Sánchez razón cuando asegura que las nucleares son parte del problema?\nEl Debate de la Economía - 13:09\nSi España no se rearma, perderá credibilidad internacional, estiman los expertos\nEl Debate de la Economía - 04:30\n«Los aranceles nos llevan a una espiral económica peligrosa que ya salió mal en los años 30»\nEl Debate de la Economía - 04:30\n«El retorno de La Caixa a Cataluña no es tan importante.

However, with the scandals associated with Hillsong NYC Lead Pastor Carl Lentz in November 2020 over \"leadership issues\" and moral failures, including being unfaithful to his wife, Laura, the mega church now only has 5 American campuses left.\nHillsong Church Global Senior Pastor Phil Dooley has this to say, \"After much prayer and thoughtful consideration, we're announcing that Brenden and Jacqui Brown will be taking on the leadership of our church community in San Francisco as a separate church, so separating from what has been part of Hillsong California.\"\n\"We believe the time is right for this. This is an exciting season for the Browns and for our church in San Francisco, and we want to say how much we love Brenden and Jacqui, and we value their dedication, their sacrifice, and their commitment to pastoring and leading the Hillsong San Francisco community,\" he added.\nHillsong San Francisco leaders, who have served the Evangelical megachurch network for 24 years, has this to say about leaving the Hillsong brand. \"We're stepping into a new season as a new church! God has been faithful in every step of our journey, and we believe He's leading us into something fresh and full of purpose. While our name is changing, our heart remains the same-to love people and connect them to Jesus.\n\"We are so grateful for our @hillsong Church family, whose faith and investment have laid the foundation for this next season. A special thank you to our Global Senior Pastors @philldooley_ and @lucindadooley , California Lead Pastors @samlopez and @courtneylopez , and the Global Board for their leadership, love, and support.\"\nThe church will be announcing their new name next week. \"Join us next Sunday as we reveal the new name of our church and unpack the vision for what's ahead! We can't wait to step into this new season together. \"",

The Nadi Weather Office says an active trough of low pressure, with associated cloud and rain, continues to affect the entire Fiji Group. They say heavy rainfall may result in flash flooding in low-lying, flood-prone areas and small streams. The National Disaster Risk Management Office is urging the public to remain vigilant for possible flash flooding in low-lying areas, informal settlements, small streams, and Irish crossings, which could disrupt traffic flow. They advise drivers to exercise extra caution when driving, as roads have deteriorated due to the continuous rainfall experienced over the past few days.",
