    "title": "50 years ago, 'Blazing Saddles' broke wind — and box office expectations | Connecticut Public",
    "text": "50 years ago, 'Blazing Saddles' broke wind — and box office expectations Fifty years ago, [Mel Brooks](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1061836388/mel-brooks-all-about-me) released Blazing Saddles to gales of laughter and a mighty roar of flatulence jokes. Also to mixed reviews from harrumphing critics. [Typical](https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/08/archives/screen-blazing-saddles-a-western-in-burlesque.html)was Vincent Canby, whose New York Times review lamented the film's \"desperate, bone crushing efforts to be funny.\" The critics eventually came around, though it took a while. By the film's 30th anniversary, NBC's Today Show was [acknowledging](https://www.today.com/popculture/blazing-saddles-still-has-big-laughs-wbna5263487)that its laughs were in the service of a plot that \"skewers just about every aspect of racial prejudice.\" And in 2006, when NPR's Linda Wertheimer reported that Blazing Saddles was being added to the National Film Registry, she was clearly [feigning incredulity](https://www.npr.org/2006/12/30/6700144/blazing-saddles-makes-national-film-registry). \"Who could have imagined a film featuring a bunch of cowboys sitting around the campfire, eating beans and breaking wind, to be enshrined in the Library of Congress?\" By then, of course, everyone could imagine. Brooks had subsequently made a slew of genre-spoof classics (Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men in Tights) and even riffed on history itself (History of the World: Part I), not to mention the 2000 Year Old Man routines he created with [Carl Reiner](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/30/510434234/carl-reiner-actor-director-writer-producer-and-mensch-dies-at-98). The man was a legend. But in 1974, he was significantly less well-known, having made a couple of mildly successful comedies (The Twelve Chairs and The Producers) and worked in [Sid Caesar](https://www.npr.org/2013/07/10/200755247/sid-caesar-who-got-laughs-without-politics-or-putdowns-dies-at-91)'s joke-writer stable for TV. So what he was doing in this western parody got, in the words of another of that era's funnymen, \"no respect.\" Upending Hollywood's version of the Old West Blazing Saddles starts out like many a Western before it: Big Sky country, a wide open prairie in the 1870s being tamed by a railroad. The foreman is white, his workers mostly African American, and he expects them to be singing as they sweat. \"When you were slaves you sang like birds,\" he smirks. \"How about a good ol' n work song.\" Brooks worried about using the racial epithet I've just elided. But his co-screenwriter [Richard Pryor](https://www.npr.org/2014/12/11/369641000/richard-pryor-a-comedy-pioneer-who-was-always-whittling-on-dynamite) insisted he use it — and use it often — consciously putting it the mouths of evil or unthinking characters, so that star Cleavon Little could comically mock or demolish them. Which he does. Repeatedly. And hilariously. So, Blazing Saddles is not really \"like many a Western before it.\" Brooks was upending Hollywood's version of the Old West, much as [Robert Altman](https://www.npr.org/2006/11/21/6520822/film-world-mourns-director-robert-altman)'s dark, land-grab drama McCabe & Mrs. Miller had, three years earlier. He just took a different tack. To set his comedy in motion, he had [Harvey Korman](https://www.npr.org/2008/05/30/90981454/comedic-actor-harvey-korman-dies-at-81)'s scheming politician come up with the idea of hiring a Black sheriff to scare the townsfolk of Rock Ridge away from their town, so he can buy it on the cheap before any of them learns the rail line will soon be coming through. His ploy works. When Cleavon Little's Sheriff Bart rides into view, they are indeed less than welcoming. But they are also less than bright – foiled in their plan to shoot their new sheriff, for instance, when he points his gun at his own head and takes himself hostage. 'He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands' Bart then teams up with [Gene Wilder](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/30/491944275/in-this-2005-interview-gene-wilder-explains-how-he-learned-to-get-laughs)'s Waco Kid, a hung-over gunslinger, at which point the film adopts the rhythms of a black/white buddy comedy. Until, that is, it turns into a spoof of The Blue Angel, as Madeline Kahn's seductress-for-hire Lili Von Shtupp croons a gloriously off-pitch \"I'm Tired\" and sets about seducing Sheriff Bart. \"He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands,\" she purrs in an accent that suggests she got vocal coaching from both Marlene Dietrich and Elmer Fudd. To satirize 1970s racial prejudice using 1870s characters, Brooks opted to become an equal-opportunity shredder of genres and conventions. A horse gets punched, as does an old lady. Even Busby Berkeley musicals come in for a brief ribbing when a brawl literally breaks the fourth wall and the cast crashes into a dance number on a nearby soundstage. And of course, there's that campfire scene: cowboys consuming pots of coffee and platefuls of baked beans, with predictable — though unusual for film — results. 'Bury it.' When studio executives first saw Blazing Saddles, they were not amused. One distributor [suggested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv7L6Hrlj58&t=99s)they \"bury it.\" Others wanted rewrites. But Brooks' [contract gave him final cut](https://ew.com/article/2014/05/01/blazing-saddles-mel-brooks/), and he flat-out refused to make changes. So on Feb. 7, 1974, the studio opened the film as a test in three cities — NYC, LA, Chicago — considered the most likely to get Brooks' Borscht Belt sense of humor. Critics were dismissive, but even the most negative reviews conceded that audiences were howling. And word got around. By the time the weather had warmed, Blazing Saddles was playing to long lines in suburban cinemas across the country. It ended up the biggest box-office hit of 1974, seen by some 63 million moviegoers in North America (more than would, decades later, see any of the Lord of the Rings movies in U.S. theaters). Blazing Saddles became, in short, a pop culture touchstone. And 50 years later, that's what it remains. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "title": "(Crónica) El Arsenal falla ante el West Ham y el Tottenham cae en Brighton",
    "text": "El Arsenal encajó su primera derrota en casa esta Premier al caer (0-2) contra el West Ham, cediendo así el liderato que asaltó el Liverpool en el 'Boxing Day', mientras que el Tottenham sufrió otro correctivo (4-2) ante el Brighton. Los de Mikel Arteta se vieron superados por un West Ham que sacó petróleo a sus pocas ocasiones y se defendió con uñas y dientes. El derbi londinense se lo quedaron los 'hammers' con el tanto a los 13 minutos de Tomas Soucek, mal defendido por los locales y validado con suspense por el VAR, y el cabezazo de Konstantinos Mavropanos. El Arsenal dominó y tuvo muchas ocasiones, sin acierto en especial Saka, y se vio con ese 2-0 en el minuto 55. Areola bajo palos mantuvo la renta de un West Ham que salió sexto de casa de su vecino y fallando de penalti el tercero. El Arsenal se queda en 40 puntos, por los 42 del Liverpool, con 39 Aston Villa y 37, pero con un partido menos por el Mundial de Clubes, el Manchester City. En el turno anterior, el Tottenham sufrió otro traspiés que le dejó fuera de la zona de Liga de Campeones (36), al final de la primera vuelta de liga. El equipo londinense cedió al sur de Inglaterra en una gran actuación de los locales en el Amex Stadium. Jack Hinshelwood y Joao Pedro pusieron un 2-0 a los 20 minutos y el tercero fue de Pervis Estupiñán en el 63'. Una losa para unos 'Spurs' que habían mejorado en el segundo tiempo, con un Richarlison sin puntería eso sí. Un nuevo penalti de Pedro supuso el 4-0, que maquilló el Tottenham en los últimos 10 minutos.

    "title": "Pope Francis denounces the weapons industry as he makes a Christmas appeal for peace in the world",
    "text": "ROME — Pope Francis on Monday blasted the weapons industry and its “instruments of death” that fuel wars as he made a Christmas Day appeal for peace in the world and in particular between Israel and the Palestinians. Speaking from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica to the throngs of people below, Francis said he grieved the “abominable attack” of Hamas against southern Israel on Oct. 7 and called for the release of hostages. And he begged for an end to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the “appalling harvest of innocent civilians” as he called for humanitarian aid to reach those in need. Francis devoted his Christmas Day blessing to a call for peace in the world, noting that the biblical story of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem sent a message of peace. But he said that Bethlehem “is a place of sorrow and silence” this year. Francis’ annual “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and the World”) speech typically offers a lament of all the misery facing the world, and this year’s edition was no different. From Armenia and Azerbaijan to Syria and Yemen, Ukraine to South Sudan and Congo and the Korean peninsula, Francis appealed for humanitarian initiatives, dialogue and security to prevail over violence and death. He called for governments and people of goodwill in the Americas in particular to address the “troubling phenomenon” of migration and its “unscrupulous traffickers” who take advantage of innocents just looking for a better life. He took particular aim at the weapons industry, which he said was fueling the conflicts around the globe with scarcely anyone paying attention. “It should be talked about and written about, so as to bring to light the interests and the profits that move the puppet strings of war,” he said. “And how can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?” Francis has frequently blasted the weapons industry as “merchants of death” and has said that wars today, in Ukraine, in particular, are being used to try out new weapons or use up old stockpiles. He called for peace between Israel and Palestinians, and for the conflict to be resolved “through sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community.” Vatican officials said about 70,000 people filled St. Peter’s Square for Francis’ noonday speech and blessing. They included many people flying Palestinian flags, as well as some Ukrainian ones. Francis’ address from the loggia marked his main appearance for Christmas Day, though he is expected to deliver a blessing on Tuesday, the feast of St. Stephen, which is also a holiday in Italy. Rounding out the holiday, he is to celebrate a New Year’s Eve vigil in the basilica and Mass the following day. Despite his recent bout of bronchitis, the 87-year-old Francis appeared to hold up well Monday and during Christmas Eve Mass the previous night, though he occasionally coughed and seemed out of breath.",
