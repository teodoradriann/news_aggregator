    "title": "Hillsong San Francisco Splits Off, Leaving Only 5 US Hillsong Campuses",
    "text": "On Sunday, Feb. 16, the global leadership of Hillsong Church announced that Pastors Brenden and Jacqui Brown , leaders of Hillsong San Francisco , are transforming that campus into a separate, independent faith community. The name of the new church will be announced on Feb. 23.\nSam Lopez, lead pastor of Hillsong California, told congregants that “nothing happened” in a negative sense. Instead, he said, the Browns are “an incredible couple [who] have a vision…and God has asked them to take a step of faith.”\nHillsong leadership backs the move “100%,” Lopez added, and is “releasing them with full blessing and in unity and excitement.”\nRELATED: ‘A New Era’—Phil and Lucinda Dooley Named Hillsong Church’s Global Senior Pastors\nThe move was announced on Hillsong’s annual Mission Sunday. This year’s theme is Taking Another Step by Faith.\nSan Fran Split Leaves 2 Hillsong Campuses in CA With the loss of its San Francisco campus, Hillsong Church now has just five U.S. locations: Los Angeles and Orange County in California, as well as New York City, New Jersey, and Boston. Before a series of high-profile scandals rocked the Australia-based megachurch, it had 16 campuses in America.\nChurchLeaders has reported extensively on Hillsong’s trouble-filled past few years. Various scandals were also featured in the docuseries “ Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed .”\nPhil Dooley, global senior pastor of Hillsong, acknowledged during his Feb. 16 sermon that “we’ve faced some challenges as a church.” Using biblical lessons from the life of Joshua, Dooley encouraged congregants to keep taking steps of faith and not to get discouraged.\nDooley then discussed the next step for Hillsong California, calling the announcement “kind of happy/sad but I think mainly happy.” He described the San Francisco campus as “healthy,” saying the Browns’ “leadership has made a lasting impact on our church.”\nRELATED: UPDATE: Brian Houston Announces Dallas Hillsong Closing After Pastors’ Misuse of Funds\nTo the couple and the church, Dooley said, “We love you, and we are committed to remaining in close relationship with you as we embark on this faithful journey together.”\nPastors Brenden & Jacqui Brown Separate From Hillsong Lopez, who has overseen all three Hillsong California campuses, offered more context about the move, saying it’s been under discussion for two years. The Browns approached him with their “fresh vision,” he said, and Hillsong leaders were just waiting for “the right time” to move forward.\nFor anyone who doubts his explanation or thinks it’s “too good to be true,” Lopez said, “That’s genuinely the full truth. We’re just excited, and part of my job is not to keep and to hoard and to try to build a little empire. My job is to see especially our staff step into the call of God on their life.”\nOn social media, Brenden and Jacqui Brown shared their excitement about “stepping into a new season as a new church!” They wrote, “God has been faithful in every step of our journey, and we believe He’s leading us into something fresh and full of purpose. While our name is changing, our heart remains the same—to love people and connect them to Jesus.”\nThe Browns thanked their church family as well as local and global Hillsong leaders. They encouraged worshipers to return on Feb. 23 “as we reveal the new name of our church and unpack the vision for what’s ahead!”",

    "text": "Police red flag rogue beer outlets\nFreeman Razemba Crime Reporter\nPOLICE have identified and are conducting investigations on some unscrupulous beer outlets and individuals countrywide who were allegedly selling alcohol to juveniles on Christmas Day.\nAccording to police, the law will take its course on some of these beer outlets, including having their licences cancelled.\nThis comes after there are several videos circulating on social media in which children can be seen abusing alcohol. In one of the incidents which occurred in the city, police have since identified two of the children while investigations to identify the other eight are still in progress.\nIn an interview, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed that they had received reports on some beer outlets who were letting children buy and consume alcohol.\nHe said the beer outlets owners were likely to face prosecution once investigations have been completed.\n“There are allegations that there were some beer outlets who were letting in children to buy alcohol at their premises and we are investigating such cases,” he said.\nOn Wednesday, police said they had identified two minors aged 13 and 11 years who were part of a group of children seen abusing alcohol in a video clip that has gone viral on social media.\nThe footage was taken in central Harare and investigations into how the minors got the alcohol have intensified.\nTheir parents have also been located while investigations are also in progress to identify the other children.\nPolice said investigations have also revealed that these children had earlier on been seen interacting with some women who were sitting nearby and they suspect that they could have been their mothers.\nAlthough it is still not clear, police suspect that their mothers could have been the ones who have been bringing them to the city to conduct street begging, vending and other misdemeanours.\nIn most cases their mothers are the ones who benefit mostly from such activities.\n“We strongly suspect that the women these children were interacting with, could have been their mothers who sometimes send their children to beg for money and we are investigating all these issues,” Asst Comm Nyathi said.\nIn a statement this week, Asst Comm Nyathi confirmed that some of these children have been identified.\n“Reference is made to the social media videos which went viral on 26th December 2023 showing minors drinking alcohol in Harare Central Business District and subsequent police investigations into the incident.\n“The Zimbabwe Republic Police reports that the identity of two minors aged 13 and 11 years is now known. Their mother and father have also been identified.”\nHe said the father and mother separated in November 2022 with the two minors being taken into the custody of their mother in the Epworth area, Harare.\nIt is alleged that they later left home and engaged in street begging, vending and some misdemeanours in Harare Central Business District with other “street kids”.\nAsst Comm Nyathi said on Christmas Day, the two minors who were in the company of eight other children, obtained alcohol through a person who is yet to be identified by the police.\n“The minors sat on the veranda of a cellphone shop along Inez Terrez near a prominent food outlet. They consumed alcohol openly in public. The Zimbabwe Republic Police has also identified a local businessperson who recorded the viral social media video. He is currently assisting the Police to get full facts on the incident.\n“The Zimbabwe Republic Police is still pursuing the identity of the other minors who were in the company of the two and allegations that there were some women who were seated at the corner of Speke and Inez Terez Street who interacted with the minors.\n“It has also been confirmed that the minors were drinking alcohol while eating some chips and chicken,” Asst Comm Nyathi said.\nThe Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance in Zimbabwe (SAAPA ZW) this week also said it was deeply concerned about the video circulating on social media showing children drinking alcohol in the streets of Harare on Christmas Day.\nThis is a grave violation of the Liquor Act, which regulates the trade in liquor in the country.\nThey called upon the authorities to take swift action and enforce the Liquor Act and also demanded that the authorities should uphold the law and punish the offenders.\nAn appeal was also made to the parents, guardians, teachers, religious leaders, and community members to play their role in educating and protecting the children from alcohol harm.",

    "title": "Amazon Workers to Strike Globally on Black Friday | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Jim Thomas | Thursday, 28 November 2024 04:50 PM EST\nAmazon workers worldwide are launching coordinated strikes and protests on Black Friday to highlight the global retail giant's employee demands for fair wages, union rights, and environmental accountability, Breitbart reported.\nCoinciding with one of the year's busiest shopping weekends, thousands of Amazon workers across more than 20 countries prepare to strike and protest during Black Friday. Coordinated by the Make Amazon Pay campaign, the demonstrations aim to push the retail giant to improve working conditions, recognize unions, address tax fairness, and prioritize environmental sustainability.\nThe Make Amazon Pay campaign unites over 80 trade unions and advocacy groups, including the Swiss-based UNI Global Union and Progressive International. Protests and strikes will occur across the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, and other nations. The campaign's fifth anniversary underscores the growing discontent among Amazon's workforce and its allies.\n\"Amazon's relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment, and democracy,\" said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union. She added that despite the company's significant investments in anti-union efforts, workers' demands for fair treatment and union representation remain undeterred.\nIn the United Kingdom, demonstrators plan to gather outside Amazon's headquarters in Bishopsgate, London. A coalition of tax justice activists and trade unionists will deliver a petition signed by over 110,000 people, urging the government to eliminate tax breaks for Amazon and other major corporations. The event will culminate in a march to 11 Downing Street, and the GMB union will host an online rally to amplify worker solidarity.\nGermany, a critical market for Amazon, is expected to see significant disruptions as members of the Ver.di Union strike at warehouses in cities including Dortmund, Leipzig, Koblenz, and Bad Hersfeld.\nSimilarly, in France, the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and Citizens' Action will lead protests to advocate for corporate tax fairness.\nAmazon has a history of opposing union efforts and alleged labor rights violations.\nLast year's Black Friday demonstrations included widespread strikes and rallies, with workers joined by international trade unionists. Organizers hope to build on that momentum by pressuring Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, to comply with their demands.\nJim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

    "text": "Thomas Jolly, the homosexual activist who insulted Christians with his opening ceremony antics, is ready to roll out the closing ceremony. It is scheduled to begin August 11 at 3:00 p.m. ET.\nThere will be the traditional athletes’ parade and medal ceremony. It will be held indoors at France’s national stadium, involving hundreds of singers, performers, acrobats, dancers and circus artists. Jolly says it is his “ambition” to “celebrate in suspended time, with conscience, and with the idea that together we can make a difference.”\nHow he will suspend time remains a mystery. But at least it is being done with a conscience, which is better than the alternative.\nJolly has already made a difference. He has joined the ranks of anti-Christian bigots. Will he give us Round 2 of his obscene portrayal of Christianity, or will the guy who grew up playing with dolls tap the brakes and be a good boy? If he does, it will show that our protest was not in vain.\nOur protest was aimed at many parties to the Olympics. We contacted Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee; the fifteen major sponsors of the Olympics; leading Republicans and Democrats; and the U.S. Olympic Committee. We not only protested what happened in the opening ceremony, we asked that they make sure that the closing ceremony is not a repeat.\nThe Catholic League was the only Catholic organization to register a formal protest. Moreover, by supplying contact information, we were the only one to give Catholics a voice in registering their objections. And unlike others, who did next to nothing, we didn’t try to hustle our supporters by asking for a donation.\nWe are happy that so many contacted Bach in July about what Jolly did. You can contact him again about the closing ceremony.\n Contact: media@paris2024.org",

    "text": "El Al Nassr de Cristiano Ronaldo, que no jugó al estar en fase de recuperación de una lesión, goleó por 6-0 y humilló al Inter de Miami de Leo Messi, que en principio no estaba convocado por unas molestias, después figuró en el banquillo, y finalmente jugó los últimos minutos, en el segundo partido de la Riyadh Season Cup. El conjunto de Arabia Saudí pasó por encima de los estadounidenses y eso que no contaron con el astro portugués, pero en su ausencia brilló en el Kingdom Arena de Riad el brasileño Anderson Talisca, que marcó tres tantos y fue un auténtico torbellino en ataque.El Al Nassr salió decidido a resolver el partido por la vía rápida con una presión atosigante ante un Inter de Miami que vive un calvario en la pretemporada, que no conoce la victoria y que ha perdido los dos partidos disputados en Riad.A los 12 minutos del primer periodo, el conjunto de Luis de Castro ya ganaba por 3-0 gracias a los tantos de Otavio, Talisca y del internaciona l español Aymeric Laporte , que marcó una falta desde más de 60 metros.El Inter de Miami era una marioneta en el campo, sin dirección ni ritmo, y solo inquietó en algunas llegadas del uruguayo Luis Suárez y con 3-0 se llegó al descanso, donde Cristiano Ronaldo disfrutó desde el palco de autoridades.El segundo tiempo fue una copia de los primeros 45 minutos y el Al Nassr supo marcar los tiempos y frenar una posible reacción del equipo entrenado por Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino , máxime cuando en el 50 Talisca logró el 4-0 al transformar un penalti. Mohamed Maran marcó el 5-0 en el 67 y seis después Talisca cerró su gran noche con el tercer tanto en el 73.El público, que llenó el estadio, empezó a rugir cuando Leo Messi, descartado en un principio por unas molestias, salió a calendar y después salió al campo para jugar los últimos 8 minutos, pero la goleada ya estaba decidida con un éxito de Cristiano Ronaldo desde la grada.6.Al-Nassr: David Ospina (Abdullah, minuto 31); Sultan Al-Ghanam, Abdulelah Al-Amri (Ali Al-Hassan, min. 60), Aymeric Laporte (Khaled Kamal, min.7, Alex Telles (Marzouq Tambakti, min.79); Alsulaihem (Ali Al-Hassan, minuto 60), Marcelo Brozović; Anderson Talisca (Muhammad Sahlouli, min. 79), Otavio (Meshari Al Nemer, min.79), Mohammed Maran, y Alalewa.0.
