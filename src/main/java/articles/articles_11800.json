    "text": "Friday, December 29: Residents of Central India may have to alter any outdoorsy plans they have made for the Near Year, for the region looks set to enter 2024 on a surprisingly wet note. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), lower-level easterly winds blowing in from the Bay of Bengal will trigger the incursion of moisture over India’s east-central states. Accordingly, light rainfall has been forecast at isolated locations across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh from this Sunday to next Tuesday, December 31 to January 2. Thunderstorm activity may also accompany the drizzling, due to which the IMD has placed yellow watches (meaning ‘be aware’ of the weather situation) over Madhya Pradesh’s northern districts. The advisories for Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are yet to be updated. The wet weather will also bring warmer nights to Central India. While the minimum temperatures in the region have already been 1.6°C to 3°C higher than normal for this time of the year, they will further rise by 2-3°C during the next three to four days. Meanwhile, IMD observations from this morning indicate the presence of very dense fog in isolated pockets of Uttar Pradesh and shallow to moderate fog in isolated areas of West Madhya Pradesh. While cold and fog are normal meteorological features for Central India at this time of the year, rainfall isn’t. Since the start of this December, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have recorded excess rains worth 179% and 462%, despite receiving precipitation worth a mere 17.9 mm and 28.1 mm, respectively. Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, has registered 5.9 mm rain, marking an excess of 22%. ** For weather and science updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

Nova Minerals identifies gold up to 20.9 g/t gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects of the Estelle Gold Project NVA +3.99% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Add to Watchlist Add Position Position added successfully to:\nPlease name your holdings portfolio Type: BUY SELL Date: Amount: Price Point Value: Leverage: 1:1 1:10 1:25 1:50 1:100 1:200 1:400 1:500 1:1000 Commission: Create New Watchlist Create Create a new holdings portfolio Add Create + Add another position Close Nova Minerals Ltd (ASX:NVA, OTCQB:NVAAF) has identified more gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects, just north and west of the new Wombat prospect of the Estelle Gold Project in the US.\nThe company has used a combination of field observations and assay results from surface samples to confirm the presence of gold-bearing quartz veins at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects.\nThe samples included 43 rock and 35 soil samples which showed anomalous gold, copper and antimony mineralisation with six rocks of more than 5 g/t with a high of 20.9 g/t gold.\nThere were also five rocks of over 2% copper with a high of 10.5% copper, and nine rocks of more than 0.1% antimony with a high of 2.6% antimony and six soils of more than 0.5 g/t gold with a high of 1.3 g/t gold.\n“Mineralisation identified at Trundle and Tomahawk contribute to the developing 35km long Estelle gold trend,” Nova Minerals head of exploration Hans Hoffman said.\n“Chasing the large veins at Wombat led us straight north to Tomahawk, and the iron-stained intrusive rocks at Trundle was an obvious target just west of Wombat.\n“With a long list of prospects from Korbel in the north to RPM in the south, these new results warrant follow-up reconnaissance mapping and sampling.”\nHighly mineralised prospects\n“These results now confirm Trundle and Tomahawk as highly mineralised prospects in not only gold, but copper, silver and antimony as well,” Nova Minerals CEO Christopher Gerteisen said.\n“These prospects have always been an area of interest for us exhibiting all the indicative features of mineralisation, including striking surface colour, alteration, and vein density anomalies, which is now confirmed through sample analysis.\n“This shows us the value of our systematic surface exploration programs which continue across the Estelle Project.\n“The claim block is 513 square kilometres and we have only scratched the surface. As we proceed into 2024 and beyond with further exploration work, we expect additional prospects to be discovered with both gold and critical and strategic element potential.\n“This aggressive ongoing exploration approach, which to date has identified over 20 known mineralised prospects, provides the company with decades of project longevity, with a pipeline of potential resources for future production scenarios.\n“As we move forward, we will prioritise this prospect portfolio for advancement towards resource definition.”\nNova says both prospects contain dominant northwest striking, steeply dipping vein orientation as seen elsewhere on the project.\nRead more on Proactive Investors AU\nDisclaimer\nNova Minerals identifies gold up to 20.9 g/t gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects of the Estelle Gold Project",
