    "text": "TAIPEI (TVBS News) — The Central Weather Administration (CWA, 氣象署) warned on Friday (Nov. 1) that Typhoon Kong-rey (康芮) continues to impact Taiwan with its peripheral circulation, raising the likelihood of localized heavy rain in mountainous areas of Miaoli County (苗栗縣), Taichung City (臺中市), and Nantou County (南投縣).\nAccording to the latest CWA data, Typhoon Kong-rey has weakened in the past three hours, with its storm radius shrinking. The administration urged residents to remain vigilant against potential landslides and debris flows.\nThe typhoon's center currently lies northeast of Matsu (馬祖) as it moves in a northeasterly direction. Although Matsu has exited the storm zone, northern Taiwan's coastal waters still face threats from the typhoon.\nThe bureau issued a heavy rain advisory at 2 p.m. for the mountainous regions of Miaoli County, Taichung City, and Nantou County. Due to the persistent rainfall, authorities advised caution when entering mountainous areas and rivers. The typhoon's intensity is expected to continue decreasing, along with a further reduction in its storm radius.",

    "title": "In Nigeria and Much of Africa, Catholic Same-Sex Couples See No Blessings Soon",
    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much.\n\"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n\"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said.\n\"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\"\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Africa , Christianity , Sao Tome and Principe , Nigeria\nRead More",

    "title": "Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer: New Global Monument Tells Testimonies of Divine Intervention",
    "text": "A new global monument dedicated to answered prayer is under construction in the United Kingdom.\nComplete with a million interactive bricks, the\nEternal Wall of Answered Prayer will be visible from six miles away.\nOrganizers are asking people to send in their testimonies to contribute to the project.\n\"I never let facts get in the way of Truth,\" Richard Gamble, founder of the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer, told CBN News. \"I've been presented with so many facts about why this can't happen. And I believe in the truth that God can do it.\"\nFor 19 years, Gamble has pursued an audacious goal to build a monument to remind the world God still works through answered prayer and healing broken hearts. He explained how it all started.\n\"I was walking along here – and this flash just popped through my mind to build a wall where every brick represented a story of answered prayer,\" he said.\nTowering over 167 feet tall, the wall, modeled on a giant infinity loop, will be displayed at Coleshill in Birmingham. The national landmark's one million bricks will link to an answered prayer.\nGamble said, \"People can come and point their phones at the bricks – even at the ones miles away – and the phone will light up and it will tell them the story of hope that lies within.\"\nMichelle Heritage, Head of Partnerships for the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer, says she witnessed the power of prayer as a single parent after God provided for her and her child.\n\"And it was really amazing to see how provision came in, how the work that I'd lost was actually replaced in a much better way – with work that had better pay. That was actually better suited to our lifestyle as a family in a new situation,\" Heritage said.\nHer story is just one example of the answered prayers that will rest in the monument.\nGamble said, \"The power of that – this is going to stand for hundreds of years.\"\nAfter two decades of planning, Gamble plans to break ground in 2024 and hopes to be operational in 2026. Now, Gamble is asking for your help by simply sharing your story of answered prayer.\n\"We got this funded, we have planning permission – I've got approval from the Prime Minister's office,\" he said. \"The hardest thing is getting Christians to give five minutes of their time – to actually share a story of what God has done.\"\nHeritage said, \"So, if you have a story of answered prayer, I would really encourage you, write it down and be ready to share it because your story of hope can be a stepping-stone for the next person's breakthrough.\"\nGamble also hopes this landmark will help break negative perceptions against faith, especially in the U.K. There, some surveys show only 31% of adults attend church.\n***First published in June 2023\nDid you know?\nGod is everywhere—even in the news.

    "text": "Guwahati: The Meghalaya Cabinet on Thursday approved two major policy decisions, one allowing women to work night shifts across the state, and another regulating the rental of private bikes and vehicles to tourists.\nChief Minister Conrad K. Sangma , who chaired the cabinet meeting, announced that the government had partially amended its earlier notification (No. LE&SD.62/2024/84 issued on January 16) to permit women to work night shifts throughout Meghalaya.\nHe emphasized that this move aligns with national and state-level labor policies and addresses a long-pending demand related to gender equality in the workplace.\n“This policy ensures women can choose to work night shifts voluntarily, with full safeguards in place,” the Chief Minister stated on social media following the cabinet meeting.\nHe confirmed that the government will implement stringent safety protocols, including CCTV monitoring and secure transportation options, to create a safe working environment.\n“No woman will be forced to work night shifts; participation will be entirely based on consent,” he added.\nIn a separate decision, the cabinet approved new regulations for renting private vehicles and two-wheelers to tourists. According to Sangma, the move aims to enhance tourist safety and bring proper structure to the growing rental market in the state.\nThe new policy requires all individuals offering rental services, for either motorcycles or four-wheelers, to register with the transport department.\n“We’ve introduced two distinct policies, one for motorcycles and another for vehicles, to ensure better oversight and service quality for tourists,” Sangma said.\nThese policy changes mark a significant step toward empowering women in the workforce and ensuring safe, regulated transport options for visitors exploring Meghalaya.",

    "text": "A thick blanket of fog has enveloped the northern plains of India, causing a significant drop in day temperatures, and raising concerns about cold day conditions in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and parts of Uttar Pradesh. This persistent fog, initially concentrated over Pakistan's Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, North Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, has now spread to parts of Jharkhand and Bihar as well. While minimum temperatures have risen slightly in the past two days, the plummeting day temperatures have brought a noticeable chill to the region. Cold day conditions, characterized by a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius or less and a maximum temperature departure from normal of -4.5°C to -6.4°C, are likely at many places. If the maximum temperature falls even further, below -5.5°C, it would be classified as a severe cold day. The dense fog, which disrupts visibility and transportation, is expected to persist for at least the next three days, although its intensity may decrease. This extended period of foggy conditions could exacerbate the cold day situation, leading to further discomfort and potential health concerns. People in the affected areas are advised to take precautions against the cold weather by wearing warm clothing, avoiding prolonged exposure to the fog, and staying updated on weather advisories. The elderly, children and those with respiratory illnesses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather and should take extra care during this period. It is important to note that Skymet is closely monitoring the situation and issuing regular updates. Following their guidance and taking necessary precautions will help residents of the northern plains navigate this foggy and chilly spell safely and comfortably. Image Credit: livemint",

Charlotte Fuller, mother of former jump jockey Page, is also involved and said: “The racecourses have been brilliantly supportive, offering tickets and boxes.”\nFollowing the closure of the forum, Phillips was seeking another suitable platform to host the hunter-chase sponsorship and a relationship with Ben Atkins of the Pointing Pointers podcast was formed.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic Atkins was asked to host the live stream at his local point-to-point and following that the Pointing Pointers podcast took off. Pointing Pointers were able to promote Phillips’ ideas through their podcast and eventually the Pointing Pointers forum was launched and many people followed the move.\nFellow podcaster Nick Luck, a pointing enthusiast himself, was keen to become involved and has put up a £5,000 bonus to any horse who has ran in a point-to-point during the current season and that can win the races staged at Catterick on March 5 and Kempton on April 1. These races will be titled ‘The Nick Luck Daily Podcast Pointing Pointers Hunter Chase’.\nLuck said: “I have a point-to-point background, Tweseldown was a favourite course to visit, my parents were involved and my brother trains the odd one or two. I hope this initiative is the start of something bigger and better, I'm very keen to support the amateur sector of our sport. This has the potential to provide a healthier and more successful link to jumps racing”.\nWeekend preview\nSouthfield Theatre, a once useful rules performer when trained by Paul Nicholls, recently celebrated his 17th birthday and will be bidding to gain his 30th career victory under his regular partner Lily Bradstock at Larkhill, Wiltshire on Saturday in the members race.\nBradstock, daughter of trainer Sara, will be hopeful he can yet again prove that age is no barrier. She says: “He is a legend, he is a total lunatic at home, he goes flat-out everywhere and being a racehorse is his job. He will only run a couple of times this season.”\nAcey Milan, trained and owned by jumps trainer Anthony Honeyball, is the pick in the novice riders race. Honeyball said: “It's brilliant to have these old horses for the lads in the yard to ride. Chad Bament won three point-to-point races on him and now Will Higgs takes over. It's important to encourage the lads that want to race-ride and it gives them a less-pressured stage at a point-to-point. It also encourages them to work hard within the team at home.”\nCourse specialist Grace A Vous Enki will be bidding to win his eighth race at Larkhill in the men's open. My Drogo, now trained by Devon's Ed Walker, ran a promising third here in December. Others to note are Duc De Bourbon who won here at the last meeting and Oscars Moonshine from the Olive Nicholls yard.\nAt Friars Haugh in Scotland connections of Dusart, who ran in high profile races such as the Cotswold Chase and the Scottish Grand National when trained by Nicky Henderson, will be hoping he can make amends for unseating at Alnwick in December in the mixed open race.\nMusic Drive, trained by Kelly Morgan in Leicestershire is an eyecatching entry and a likely runner in the mixed-open race at Revesby Park.\nPreviously trained in Ireland by Gordon Elliott, the eight-year-old hasn’t run since December 2022 and Morgan said: “The weather has been frustrating and we have had a stop-start prep, but I hope he can do himself justice.”\nSaturday\nLarkhill, Wiltshire, SP4 8QR.

    "text": "BY ALEXANDER HERNANDEZ GONZALEZ JANUARY 23, 2025\nFounder and creative director Alexandre Mattiussi captured the authentic essence of Parisian chic at AMI’s Fall/Winter 2025 runway show. Celebrating everyday luxury by elevating everyday silhouettes while maintaining comfort was the main priority for this season’s collection. Mattiussi referenced numerology and how the number 2025 represents the boldness and serenity that his lucky number, nine, also does. This feel-good collection combines modernity and heritage, empowering both men and women to feel optimistic about the future. Here are the five things you need to know about AMI’s latest collection.\nSLOUCHY SUITS\nIt’s official: suits can be an everyday type of outfit. Whether you want a dark green wool suit to wear to a coffee date or a multi-chromatic look consisting of gray, olive green, brown, mustard yellow, and black, this silhouette makes a traditionally professional look into an oversized yet tailored style for anyone to wear.\nPLAID IS BACK, BABY\nA caramel and black plaid came down the intimate runway, allowing for a well-known print to take shape within the AMI world. Skirts, blazers, and a stunning trenchcoat take on the pattern, adding a bit of eye candy to monochromatic tops and bottoms. These three small but mighty looks show the versatility that plaid can bring to a wardrobe.\nWORKWEAR IS NOT JUST FOR WORK\nWith pieces of clothing such as blouses, dresses, and the classic button up shirt, AMI redefined what workwear can be transformed into on a daily basis. Short-sleeved blazers, luxurious gray shearling coats, and flowy turtleneck shirts are not just office-attire; rather, these workwear essentials easily belong in every space.\nBROWN SUEDE IS FASHION’S COZIEST\nEven though brown and suede are traditionally associated with the fall season, why not mix them together to create fall’s new favorite duo. Button-up jackets and slouchy handbags are great pieces to add to your wardrobe. Yet, a rich yet sophisticated brown skirt paired with the classic oversized brown wool jacket, dark brown handbag, and oxblood boots show what brown suede can and will bring to the public during the colder seasons.\nSILK IS NOT JUST FOR THE BED\nWhen we think of silk, we usually associate it with nightwear and the breathability that it brings to our bodies. But, silk can be worn out on a daily basis, regardless of what the day may have in store. Eye-catching muted silk dresses and blouses, dress shirts with silk panels, and a stunning muted chartreuse wrap coat with a silk collar demonstrate how to fashionably style silk on a daily basis.\nScroll through the gallery below to see every look from AMI’s Fall/Winter 2025 collection.",

    "text": "‘God is good!’ Jamaicans in Florida happy to escape Hurricane Milton’s wrath NEW YORK, United States — Jamaicans in Florida have escaped major damage from Hurricane Milton which slammed into the state late Wednesday night, packing winds of more than 145 miles an hour, and causing historic rainfall and flooding. “God is good,” Joan Edghill, president of the Jamaican Association of Central Florida, told the Jamaica Observer, noting that “there [was] no serious damage in the Ocoee area near Orlando. There [have] been no reports of damage from the winds or flooding but people are out cleaning up whatever little debris there is.” She acknowledged, though, that for some, the passage of the hurricane had been a nerve-racking experience. Miramar resident Juliet Mattadeen had a similar story. She told the Observer that “the hurricane caused no issues and, in fact, people relocated from other areas of the state to stay with friends and relatives”. Damion Thompson, a West Palm Beach resident, said that while many Jamaicans were well-prepared for the storm, it passed without any major damage. He said that except for some heavy rains and winds there was nothing to be concerned about. Miami-based retiree Alman Bailey was among those who told the Observer that the hurricane had no direct impact on him. “Heavy rains was the only problem,” he said. In Lauderhill, which has a big Jamaican population, Denise Grant, who is seeking to be elected the city’s mayor, said the area was spared any serious damage as a result of the storm although it was under tornado watch. She, too, noted that there was a lot of rain and that several lost electricity, which she said has since been restored. It was not all good news for everyone, however. In Tampa and nearby Tampa Bay which were among the worst-hit areas, some Jamaicans were among those who had their homes damaged by flood waters,” said Peter Gracey, Global Jamaica Diaspora Council (GJDC) representative for the southern United States. He said, however, that “it is not possible at the moment to provide detailed information on the situation as some [Jamaicans] had relocated elsewhere and may only now be beginning to return home to assess the situation.” However, he stated that most people within the Jamaican community seemed to be alright based on the feedback so far. Grant told the Observer that “some Jamaicans in Palm Beach suffered some damage. I don’t know to what extent, but I am working to get some information.” The GJDC’s Gracey said, in the meantime, people who may need assistance should call the state’s helpline at 833 438 4673.",
