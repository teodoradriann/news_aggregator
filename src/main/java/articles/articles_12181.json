    "title": "Gobierno de Biden amenaza con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración",
    "text": "(CNN) -- El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos amenazó con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración en una carta enviada este jueves, según una copia que CNN obtuvo del documento. Esto supone la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y el gobernador de Texas, el republicano Greg Abbott, sobre la gestión de la frontera entre EE.UU. y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de detener a los inmigrantes y a los jueces la capacidad de emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de \"increíblemente extrema\". Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEn una carta dirigida a Abbott, el Departamento de Justicia argumentó que la medida \"se antepone y viola la Constitución de EE.UU.\" y también amenaza con afectar la capacidad del gobierno federal para hacer cumplir la ley de inmigración.\n\"En consecuencia, Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para impedir la aplicación de la SB4 a menos que Texas acceda a abstenerse de implementar la ley. Estados Unidos se ha comprometido tanto a asegurar la frontera como a garantizar el procesamiento de los no ciudadanos de conformidad con la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA). La ley SB4 es contraria a estos objetivos\", afirma la carta, firmada por el subsecretario adjunto Brian Boynton.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nLa amenaza legal de este jueves se produce después de que el Departamento de Justicia demandara a Texas por el uso de boyas flotantes en el río Grande. La demanda sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Call it ‘Swiftonomics’: How Taylor Swift brought a gold rush to Kansas City | KMUW",
    "text": "Call it ‘Swiftonomics’: How Taylor Swift brought a gold rush to Kansas City The Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City estimates that Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour this summer had an economic impact of $200 million. Then Swift kept coming back to the city because of her relationship with Travis Kelce. Local business owners and even the city’s tourism board say they're reaping the benefits. 2023 was a big year for Kansas City. The Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl in February. Taylor Swift’s two-night Eras Tour performance in July included an additional song in her set and a new music video debut to accompany her release of \"Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).\" The city went all out for her stop, creating a lineup of Swift-themed events. But perhaps the most unexpected high for the city was when Swift showed up at a Chiefs game in September, making her relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce public. Swelce — or Traylor, or Tayvis — brought renewed worldwide attention to Kansas City. Mayor Quinton Lucas says Swift’s given Kansas City a big reputation — one that doesn’t have anything to do with the Wizard of Oz. With this relationship, he says Kansas City is in its superstar era. “I happened to be in Paris this year for the Rugby World Cup. There was a woman from the Foreign Service in New Zealand who said, ‘Oh my gosh, you're from Kansas City,’” Lucas said. “She's like ‘Taylor Swift, right? And she's dating some not-very-famous footballer.’ Like, actually, he's kind of a big deal for us.” VisitKC says the city made about $48 million from Swift's Eras Tour this summer, while the Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City estimates her Kansas City shows had [a $200 million impact](https://edckc.com/economic-showdown-taylor-swift-vs-the-nfl-draft/) on the U.S. economy. Then, after her relationship with Kelce went public, StubHub reported that [ticket sales for all Chiefs home games tripled for the rest of the season](https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article279778669.html). Derek Byrne, a spokesperson for VisitKC, says it’s opened a lot of doors for the city to promote itself. “Even if Taylor Swift’s name isn’t in some of the work we’re doing, it is still giving people a reason to think of us a little more seriously,” Byrne said. According to an analysis by Google Trends, searches asking, “Where is Kansas City?” more than doubled in the U.S. over the past three months and search interest in local restaurants skyrockets each time the couple visits one. Even searches for flights based on the pair’s travel patterns out of Kansas City, are rising. “I feel like it's so much more in the zeitgeist,” Sarah Armstrong, a trends expert with Google, said. “Whenever Taylor Swift visits Kansas City, we see a huge spike in searches for ‘Is Taylor Swift in Kansas City?’” Armstrong says searches for Kansas City were at their highest after the Chiefs' Super Bowl wins, but the Swift-Kelce relationship is a close second. It’s too early to tell if the relationship will have a major impact on travel and economic activity in the city, but Kansas City business owners say the newfound attention has been a boon for them. Chris Harrington, the owner of [Westside Storey](https://thewestsidestorey.com/), suspected that he sold some vintage Chiefs gear to Swift herself. After she wore a vintage sweatshirt from the store to one of her latest Chiefs excursions, a video of them packing the order, including a shirt that said “Who’s Travis Kelce anyway? Ew” got nationwide attention, and business soared. It soared again at another Chiefs game when Swift was seen wearing a hand-crocheted hat from Kathryn Cacho, Westside Storey’s social media manager who also runs [Kut the Knit](https://www.instagram.com/kuttheknit/), a vintage knitwear business. “It will be part of our legacy in some sense, as weird as that sounds that one person just buys a sweatshirt and that's like a moment,” Harrington said. “But for us, being a small shop in Kansas City, that is our moment.” [Arts & Life](https://www.kcur.org/arts-life) [Welcome to Kansas City, Taylor Swift! We made you a guide for getting to know our city](https://www.kcur.org/arts-life/2023-12-09/taylor-swift-kansas-city-chiefs-travis-kelce-guide-things-to-do) [Gabe Rosenberg](https://www.kcur.org/gabe-rosenberg) Harrington said on a typical day about 10 people will be browsing their website. After their viral Swift moment, the store had about 500 people buying merchandise. Swift’s attention has doubled the sales from their previous biggest day, the Super Bowl. And those crocheted hats are currently [sold out](https://www.kansascity.com/article283161608.html). At Made in KC, a collective of Kansas City vendors, co-owner Keith Bradley has noticed a lot more Swift and Kelce-related foot traffic. “It's definitely something that I think the city is really proud of,” Bradley said. “Whether you're a diehard fan or just getting to know Taylor Swift or have never heard of her, you can't escape her celebrity.” Bradley says the relationship has inspired the vendors at his stores to create Swift and Kelce-centric merchandise — like a pair of earrings with both of their faces or a sweatshirt in Chiefs colors that says “I’m just here for Taylor.” There’s no telling whether the Taylor Swift magic will continue to rub off on Kansas City, but it’s a relationship residents and businesses here eagerly support. Lucas said the relationship is also changing how the city promotes itself to tourists: What else can people do and see here while hoping to catch a glimpse of Swift at a football game? “It's making it a lot easier for me to sell Kansas City,” he said.

    "text": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - June 27, 2024) - American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTCQB: AAIRF) (\" Aires \" or the \" Company \"), a pioneer in innovative technology designed to safeguard against electromagnetic radiation and enhance human well-being, issues this news release in order to clarify certain financial disclosure contained in its news release dated June 18, 2024 (the \" June 18 th Press Release \").\nIn the June 18 th Press Release, the Company disclosed year-over-year (\" YoY \") order volume figures for April and May 2024 expressed as percentage increases compared to the same months in 2023. For ease of comparison, the Company is pleased to further report that it achieved order volume:\nin April 2024 of US$561,206, representing a 47% increase in order volume realized in April 2023 of US$380,616;\nin May 2024 of US$940,695, representing a 98% increase in order volume realized in May 2023 of US$475,114; and\nbetween June 1, 2024 and June 25, 2024 of US$477,691, representing an 18% increase in order volume realized between June 1, 2024 and June 25, 2024 of US$406,323.\nAires tracks order volume figures in US dollars, as this is the principal currency of the Company's online store and therefore enables investors to compare YoY results excluding the effect of foreign exchange conversions. When the YoY order volume figures given above are converted into Canadian dollars, the Company's order volumes:\nin April 2024 were C$767,393, representing a YoY increase of 50% from the same month in 2023;\nin May 2024 were C$1,285,929, representing YoY increase of 100% from the same month in 2023; and\nbetween June 1, 2024 and June 25, 2024 were C$654,898, representing a YoY increase of 21% from the same period in 2023.\nThe Company has chosen to provide order volume figures (a non-IFRS metric) rather than revenue figures (an IFRS metric) because order volume figures are more readily available than revenue figures, but still represent a consistent, accurate metric to measure growth in the Company's sales for YoY comparison. Order volume is a reflection of demand for the Company's products and ability to generate sales to the end user. Order volume figures are derived from the Company's Shopify store reports by taking gross sales and deducting discounts. Revenue figures are based on same order volume figures, but are subsequently adjusted to: (1) subtract refunds, (2) add shipping revenue, and (3) add or subtract any adjustment caused by the timing differences between when an order was placed and when it was shipped (as IFRS requires revenue to be reported when orders are shipped, whereas order volume is reported when orders are placed). Due to the time it takes to make the adjustments required to obtain revenue figures, the Company chooses to report revenue on a quarterly basis only. The Company does not expect order volume and revenue figures to be materially different for any given period.\nIn Q1 of 2024, the Company's advertising and promotion expenses represented 53% of the Company's revenue generated during Q1 of 2024. Although the Company's advertising and promotion expenses for June 2024 are not yet available, to their best estimation, management expects that advertising and promotion expenses for Q2 of 2024 will represent approximately the same percentage (53%) of the Company's revenue generated during Q2 of 2024.\nThe information contained in this press release constitutes Corrective Disclosure as defined in OSC Staff Notice 51-711 (Revised) Refilings and Corrections of Errors , and was requested to be disclosed by staff of the OSC (\" Staff \") in connection with a Staff review.\nAbout American Aires Inc.\nAmerican Aires Inc. is a Canadian-based nanotechnology company committed to enhancing well-being and environmental safety through science-led innovation, education, and advocacy. The company has developed a proprietary silicon-based resonator that protect against the harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR).

    "text": "[Verdaderofalso](/user/Verdaderofalso)a [eldesmarque.com](/go/link/3953652)\nHay españoles nativos con apellidos españoles como peleteiro o españoles hijos de inmigrantes como Nico Williams que llevan el nombre de España a lo más alto, nos engrandecen y son un orgullo para mí país.\nAhora bien, hay otros hijos, como los hijos de puta racistas de mierda, que son una lacra y un puto cáncer para España y no hay manera de librarse de ellos. Bueno, si hay maneras.\n[#24](c24#c-24) Según el baremo de algunos los requisitos son: ser mala persona, perseverar en la ignorancia y dar vergüenza ajena.\n[#24](c24#c-24) Lo que ponga en tu NIE. Ser españól es básicamente una situación administrativa. Más allá de eso, nadie te debería poder imponer de dónde te sientes, si es que te sientes de algún lado.\nEl gran problema de las redes sociales actuales es el efecto altavoz que provocan.\nQuien es el Alberto Caliu este y por qué debería importarme\n[#27](c27#c-27) Cualquier gilipollas irrelevante se tira un pedo en Twitter y crea tendencia. No creo que eso aporte nada bueno al desarrollo social de un país.\nVaya por delante que si twitter tuviera un mínimo de filtro, la cuenta del calio ése debería probablemente haber sido suspendida hace años, habría que hacerse responsable de comentarios xenófobos en redes sociales y deporte.\nPero tampoco estoy de acuerdo con Peleteiro. Si nos ponemos a buscar gilipollas en twitter, red que parece dedicada a ese perfil en concreto, necesitariamos más mano de obra en ir denunciando twitts que en construir 10 nuevos estadios Bernabeus. No creo que sea razonable encontrar algún tarado en twitter para hacer un \"no quiero generalizar pero...\".\n[#15](c15#c-15) un insulto racista es un insulto racista, aunque la gente se escude en el anonimato para demostrar lo saco de mierda que es.\nLas cosas no son menos graves porque ocurran a través de las redes sociales.\nPorque por esa regla de tres, el bullyng que sufren cientos de adolescentes en España a través de ellas y que tantos estragos hacen a su salud mental, quedaría minimizado. Y estamos seguros de que nadie quiere eso.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Nació y estudió en Pamplona, y su familia vive allí. Para algunos es vasco y para otros, no. Por tanto, puede jugar con la selección española, o con la de Ghana, de donde son sus padres. Su hermano Iñaki juega con Ghana, creo.\nUn abrazo muy fuerte de un vecino suyo de la Rotxapea\n[#3](c3#c-3) No todos pueden jugar donde le de la Ghana.\nJo, vaya día que llevo. Esto no se lo merece nadie, ni yo mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) A mi ver a personas con rasgos de cualquier otra parte, pero con un acento típico de una región de España me saca la sonrisa, ya que es signo de que desde pequeño vive aquí como uno más, y en la mayoría de los casos es nacido aquí.\n[#1](c1#c-1) \"Yo no soy racista. Yo prefiero a un negro, negro, que hable euskera que a un blanco que lo ignore\"\nXabier Arzalluz.\nLo jodido para Arzalluz es que Williams ni es blanco ni habla euskera, que yo sepa. Y si tenemos en cuenta sus comentarios sobre el RH vasco, ya queda claro que el problema de Williams, como siempre, son los rancios de derechas de toda la vida.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Con el PNV hemos topado, otros que no son ni de izquierdas ni de derechas ...\n\"Aita\" Arzallus era de los últimos que enseñaban la patita en público, pero son todos iguales. Es lo que tiene la endogamia ...\n[#13](c13#c-13) El comentario de Arzallus fue bastante manipulado. De hecho el tenía el RH positivo, al contrario que el típico RH negativo vasco.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Medir el patriotismo en si pagas o no impuestos tela... ¿Quienes pagan más impuestos son más patriotas que los que pagan menos impuestos? ¿El que se va a Alemania para tener buenas condiciones de trabajo ya no puede ser patriota?\n[#42](c42#c-42) Sí, pero el que dice que vive en Suiza para no pagar impuestos en España, además de no ser patriota es un delincuente.\n[#37](c37#c-37) A mí mientras vivan de verdad en Andorra, nada que objetar. El problema es que muchos de ellos siguen viviendo en España, y en Andorra simplemente se han comprado una casa para declararla (falsamente) como su residencia.\nPara mí está noticia es una buena noticia\nNico Williams ha recibido UN comentario racista en Twitter.\nAna dice que jamás se ha encontrado con un comentario racista.\nLos infrahumanos siempre existirán, pero mientras sean cuatro gatos...\nVaya, seguramente el que ha hecho ese comentario tenga bastantes genes \"moros\", como muchos españoles",

    "title": "Joel Klatt Says Jim Harbaugh Rumors Will Loom Over College Football Playoff Game",
    "text": "While many college football fans are tuning into College Football Playoff coverage to see who might have the advantage in either of the two semifinal games, others are watching to hopefully get a clue into the future of one of the coaches leading a playoff team. Jim Harbaugh is no stranger to flirting with a possible exit from Michigan to head to the NFL, and once again, rumors are swirling. Fox college football analyst Joel Klatt says these rumors are already looming over Michigan’s game against No. 4 Alabama in the Rose Bowl. “He was successful at every level he’s been at. He was successful in the National Football League, he’s been successful now in college, and he’s going to be the number one candidate on any NFL coaching search,” Klatt said on Thursday’s episode of The Joel Klatt Show. Reports recently revealed the Wolverines have a ten-year extension worth $125 million on the table for Harbaugh. One of the big hurdles is a stipulation that he won’t seek an NFL job in the 2024 cycle. With all the current prime NFL openings and potential NCAA penalties in the coming years, this could be why Michigan has yet to secure its head coach’s signatures. “So now that’s looming over this game. He’s in L.A. to play the Rose Bowl against Alabama and everyone’s going to be thinking about the Chargers. Is he going to be the Chargers next head coach? Why hasn’t he signed the extension with Michigan if it’s $125 million? Can he get $20 million [per year] to go to the National Football League?” Klatt said. Harbaugh dodged questions about his college football coaching future while speaking to members of the media on Wednesday while on a team bonding trip to Disney Land. We’ll likely have to wait until after Jan. 1 when the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines and No. 4 Alabama Crimson Tide kickoff in the Rose Bowl at 5:00 p.m. ET on ESPN.",
