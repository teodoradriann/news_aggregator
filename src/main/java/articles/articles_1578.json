    "title": "Vizhinjam Port a perfect example of PM Modi's 'Maritime Amrit Kaal 2047' vision: Karan Adani",
    "text": "Thiruvananthapuram, July 12 : Vizhinjam Port is a perfect example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's triple focus - Ports for Prosperity, Ports for Progress and Ports for Productivity -- Karan Adani, Managing Director of Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ) said on Friday, adding that the company has fulfilled the promise to convert Vizhinjam into a world-class port. Addressing the gathering after officially receiving the first mothership at the country's first trans-shipment port near Kovalam Beach in Kerala, Karan Adani said that every aspect that they had planned for \"is coming together\". \"We are privileged to have been given this opportunity to use our expertise to transform this part of India, in line with 'Maritime Amrit Kaal 2047', our Prime Minister's vision for the maritime sector,\" said the Adani Ports Managing Director. He said that today is the day when a 33-year-old dream has finally come true for \"Vizhinjam, for Kerala and for India\". The company has already created over 2,000 direct and indirect jobs in construction, operations and other segments and now, with these wide-ranging developments, \"we will create more than 5,500 additional direct and indirect employment opportunities right here in Vizhinjam\". On Thursday, 'San Fernando', a vessel of the world's second-largest shipping company Maersk, arrived at the port country with over 2,000 containers on it. With the arrival of the first mothership, Adani Group's Vizhinjam Port has catapulted India into the world port business as globally this port will rank 6th or 7th. Speaking in the presence of Union Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, and state Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Karan Adani said that 'San Fernando', is a symbol of a new, glorious achievement in Indian maritime history. \"It is a messenger that will tell the world that India's first automated container transhipment port and largest deepwater port has begun commercial operations,\" said Karan Adani. In 1991, when this port project was first announced, Vizhinjam was just another village with ordinary prospects. \"At that time, no one could have imagined that it would become a world-class port - and, let me tell you in all humility, this port is going to be one of the world's top destinations for global container shipping,\" he noted. The 300-metre-long San Fernando, operated by Maersk which is one of the world's leaders in shipping and logistics, is the first commercial container cargo vessel to call at this port. \"We can all be confident that this ship is just the first of many thousands of very large container ships that will berth in this port in the years ahead,\" Karan Adani noted. He extended his deep gratitude on behalf of the Adani Group to Chief Minister Vijayan and Union Minister Sonowal, along with the state and central governments. \"The people of Kerala are known for their resilience, intellect and progressive outlook. To the world, Keralites or Malayalis represent educated human capital. That gives us the confidence that the people of Kerala want this port to be a global leader - a port that will become a beacon of progress and prosperity for Kerala and beyond,\" Karan Adani emphasised. As soon as the Adani Group receives the environmental clearance and other regulatory approvals, the company will begin work immediately on the port's remaining phases - and this could begin as early as October this year. \"We already have 600 metres of operational quay length and we are preparing 7,500 container yard slots to accept cargo. While we are expected to handle 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per annum in Phase 1, we are confident that we will handle 1.5 million TEUs – 50 per cent more,\" said Adani Ports MD. By 2028-29, when all four phases of this project are completed, the Kerala government and Adani Vizhinjam Port will have invested a total of Rs 20,000 crore in \"this outstanding example of a large-scale PPP project\". Through the Adani Skill Development Centre, the company will equip thousands of young women and men with advanced specialised skills relevant to the maritime sector. \"When we took on this project, our Chairman Gautam Adani promised to make Vizhinjam, India's Port of the Future'. That is what it has become,\" said Karan Adani. --IANS sg-na/svn",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "Avalanche Creek Gorge 4.23.16. (Photo by NPS / Jacob W. Frank) Three visitors to Glacier National Park are in stable condition after falling into Avalanche Creek on Sunday, park officials said Tuesday in a news release. Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, park dispatch received multiple satellite SOS reports stating that individuals had fallen into Avalanche Creek, and CPR was being performed on two of the individuals. A group of four visitors from Florida were gathering for a photo on the rocks above Avalanche Gorge when one individual slipped and fell into the water, and a second and third person trying to help also fell in, according to Glacier. Two of the individuals were swept through the gorge while one was able to grab ahold of tree branches in the gorge, waiting for help, the release said. Rangers who responded found both individuals who had been swept through the gorge to be responsive, as bystanders performing CPR were successful in resuscitating them, the park said. It wasn’t immediately clear how the individuals were removed from the creek or the number of bystanders on scene who came to their aid. The first ranger on scene was informed of the individual who was trapped in the gorge. The ranger was able to rappel to the individual and secure them while the technical rescue team was assembled and retrieved both the individual and the ranger, according to Glacier. All patients were transported to Logan Health in Kalispell, the park said. One patient was transported by ALERT, the second patient by Three Rivers Ambulance, and the third patient by Whitefish Ambulance. All members involved are in stable condition, according to the release. Drowning is the number one cause of death in Glacier National Park, according to park officials, and visitors are reminded to watch their surroundings near water. “Swift, cold glacial streams and rivers, slick rocks or slippery logs all present dangers. Never walk, play, or climb on slippery rocks and logs, especially around waterfalls,” the news release warned. In the news release, park officials thanked visitors “for their heroic efforts” that saved two lives, as well as Three Rivers Ambulance, ALERT and the Whitefish Fire Department.",

    "text": "[U.S. News](../) Boeing workers overwhelmingly reject contract, prepare to strike Boeing Co. workers and supporters hold signs outside the Aerospace Machinists Union District 751 Hall ahead of a vote on the union contract in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty Images More than 30,000 [Boeing](//www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/) workers were set to strike Friday, halting production of most of the company’s aircraft after staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract. It’s a costly development for the manufacturer that has struggled to ramp up production and [restore its reputation](//www.cnbc.com/2024/07/18/boeing-path-forward.html) following safety crises. Workers in the Seattle area and in Oregon voted 94.6% against a [tentative agreement](//www.cnbc.com/2024/09/08/boeing-and-union-reach-a-labor-deal-potentially-averting-a-strike.html) that Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers unveiled Sunday. They voted 96% to strike, far more than the two-thirds vote required for a work stoppage. “We strike at midnight,” said IAM District 751 President Jon Holden at a press conference where he announced the vote’s results. He characterized it as an “unfair labor practice strike,” alleging that factory workers had experienced “discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance and we had unlawful promise of benefits.” He said Boeing needs to bargain in good faith. Boeing didn’t immediately comment. A worker walks outside the Boeing Co. manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty Images The tentative proposal included 25% wage increases and other improvements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had sought raises of about 40%. Workers had complained about the agreement, saying that it didn’t cover the increased cost of living. The vote is a blow to [CEO Kelly Ortberg](//www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/new-boeing-ceo-kelly-ortberg.html), who has been in the top job for five weeks. A day before the vote, he had urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery. The ultimate financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts. Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a 30-day cash impact from a strike could be a $1.5 billion hit for Boeing and said it “could destabilize suppliers and supply chains.” She forecast the tentative agreement would have had an annual impact of $900 million if passed. Boeing has burned through about $8 billion so far this year and has mounting debt. Production has fallen short of expectations as the company works to stamp out manufacturing flaws and faces other industry-wide problems such as supply and labor shortages. A blowout of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 at the start of the year has brought additional federal scrutiny of Boeing’s production lines.

From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? [Let us know!](#Section1) This story was supported by a statehouse coverage grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Wilmington resident Constance Johnson sits in atTAcK addiction’s Resource Center, putting together hygiene bags to give to people trying to get sober or in recovery. Her son Camille died of a fentanyl overdose in 2022. “It’s important to me that we erase the stigma,” she said. New data from the state’s Division of Forensic Science brings a sign of hope in the fight against drug overdoses. The state has struggled to contain the spread of deadly narcotics, including fentanyl, cocaine and the animal tranquilizer xylazine. Findings released Thursday by Lt. Governor Bethany Hall-Long and the Department of Health and Social Services show that overdose deaths have dropped for the first time in a decade from one year to the next. In 2023, there were 527 accidental drug overdose deaths, representing a 1.8% decrease compared to 2022. “I was extremely pleased with the decrease in the number of fatal overdose deaths in our state,” Hall-Long said. “It is so meaningful to all the amazing partners and individuals and advocates, who’ve leaned-in with our state agencies, our commissions and consortiums for the first time to really see this difference. It really matters.” The Forensic Science division reported 537 deaths in 2022 from drug and alcohol intoxication, an increase of about 4.3% from the 514 deaths in 2021. Joanna Champney, director of the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, said in a statement that their strategy has been to erase the stigma of addiction, encourage more healthcare providers to screen for substance abuse disorders, get people into treatment and make sure they are treated regardless of income or ability to pay. The state has also focused on ensuring Narcan, a medication that can reverse an overdose, is available throughout the state. Jill Fredel sits on the board of atTAcK addiction and directs its communications. A former communications staffer for DHSS, she said one year is not enough for it to be seen as a trend and points out that OD deaths are still four times as high as Delaware’s traffic fatalities. More than 140,000 Delaware adults are living with a substance use disorder, the news release said. And some trends are going the wrong way. Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health statistics show rising fatal overdoses and drug use in Black and Hispanic/Latino communities. “We are seeing this trend line whereas the state is reporting, there are more Black people who are fatally overdosing, and there are more Hispanic people who are dying from fatal overdoses,” Fredel said. “So we really have to look at that and see what’s happening. We need to do outreach to those communities as well. This is no longer a white suburban issue, it is fanning out into more communities.” Hall-Long chairs the Delaware Behavioral Health Consortium and co-chairs the Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission with Attorney General Kathy Jennings. The Consortium aims to be a national model focused on addressing prevention, education, treatment and recovery for mental health, substance use, and co-occurring disorders. The commission is charged with distributing over $250 million in opioid settlement funds to expand access to substance use treatment services. It has distributed more than $10 million to date.

    "text": "Theatre & Music\nStephanie Gregoire Joins UIC as Clinical Assistant Professor of Music Education\n“I’ve been training for this job my whole life.”\nStephanie Gregoire doesn’t just teach music—she builds spaces where students belong.\nThis fall, she joins the University of Illinois Chicago as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Music Education, bringing with her a decade of experience that spans middle schools, community programs, and university classrooms. For Gregoire, music education is inseparable from questions of identity, equity, and inclusion. “All of my experiences point to the humanization of teaching,” she said. “You’re teaching the people, not just the music.”\nOriginally from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Gregoire moved to Chicago in 2014 to join the Chicago Children’s Choir (now Uniting Voices) as a conductor. “I grew up in a small, close-knit town with very little diversity,” she said. “Chicago was the opposite—big, expansive, and incredibly diverse. But what I learned working in neighborhood schools was that every school, no matter where it is, is a reflection of its community.” Performing across the city—from the Art Institute to national conferences—Gregoire deepened her belief that music is a vehicle for connection and representation.\nGregoire is currently completing her PhD at Northwestern’s Bienen School of Music, where her research focuses on gender, sexuality, and intersectionality in choral spaces. She explores how collective identity shapes who feels welcome in music classrooms—and who doesn’t. “We join choirs to sing, but also to belong,” she explained. “So what happens when people don’t see themselves in the way choirs are structured? My research asks how we can build more inclusive choral models.”\nAt UIC, she sees an opportunity to help build a music education program that reflects and serves the city. “When I read the job description, I thought, ‘I’ve been training for this job my whole life,’” she said. “Every part of my journey—musically, educationally, personally—has led to this moment of preparing teachers to teach in urban schools like those in Chicago.”\nGregoire is especially excited about UIC’s collaborative, interdisciplinary approach. “Music educators need to be ready for everything—from teaching a choral warm-up to managing a musical theater production,” she said. “I want to help build a program that disrupts the norm, that fuses students’ life experience with their school experience. We need programs that challenge the status quo and ask future teachers to think critically about who they are and who they serve.”\nWith 40% of UIC’s undergraduates coming from Chicago Public Schools, Gregoire sees the program as uniquely positioned to shift the national music education landscape. “We can change the pipeline,” she said. “Most music educators in this country are still white, and most teacher training programs are designed around traditional models. But at UIC, we’re building something new. We’re preparing students to be both great musicians and transformative educators.”\nThat mindset is also central to how Gregoire teaches. “I want my students to walk away with curiosity and critical thinking skills. I want them to feel mentally prepared—not just musically trained—to build programs that are excellent and responsive to their communities,” she said. “To do that work well, they have to bring their whole selves into the classroom, and make space for students to do the same.”\nHead of Music, Brent C. Talbot is “beyond thrilled to welcome Stephanie to our music department!” Dr. Gregoire brings the energy and expertise to complement the skillsets of our other hires like Dr. Tiffanie Waldron. Stephanie’s years of experience teaching in Chicago and the deep connections she has forged with school administrators will be a huge asset to our students and our music degree program. With Stephanie Gregoire, Tiffanie Waldron, and me at the center of our music education program, along with our team of dedicated faculty and staff and community partners, we have rapidly positioned UIC to become a national leader in urban music education. In the next few years our goal is to create visible change in the city of Chicago and the field of music education.”\nWhen she’s not teaching or researching, Gregoire finds balance on the ice. A former hockey player, she returned to the sport this year by joining the Evanston Tigers women’s league. “It’s been transformative,” she said. “Playing hockey gives me a space completely outside of music and academia. It demands my full physical and mental focus, and that separation actually helps me show up better at work. It’s all about setting boundaries and protecting joy.”\nStarting in Fall 2025, Gregoire will help usher in the next generation of Chicago music educators at UIC.",

Si bien está logrando adaptarse por ahora, es probable que muera pronto de agotamiento y hambre, dicen los expertos. Imágenes aéreas tomadas con un dron muestran que a la ballena jorobada (Megaptera novaeangliae) le falta su icónica aleta caudal lobulada, que es responsable de la propulsión mientras nada. Es probable que haya perdido su aleta caudal debido a un prolongado enredo en líneas de pesca u otros desechos.\nEtiquetas\nballena jorobada\ncola\npedúnculo\nred\naparejo de pesca\naleta caudal\nmenéalo\n3\nDE3C548D-E347-406A-A60F-E6BBD322CAB7\n36\n1\nCopiar enlace\nCompartir en X\nCompartir en facebook\nCompartir en telegram\nEmbed\nImagénes...\nMás información\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-OTROS-ROBA1 –>\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-OTROS-MEGA1 –>\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-OTROS-ROBA1 –>\nLoguéate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
