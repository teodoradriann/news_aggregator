    "text": "Off-road drivers were swept away by river, says man who tried to save them\nEmergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday.\nA man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river.\nEmergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday.\nA 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said.\nChris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane.\nThe river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said.\nIt came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday.\nMr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said.\nHe and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said.\nPolice said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment.\nMr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards.\n“They were part of an off-road club.\n“I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "title": "Buttah Skin: The Brand Changing the Face of Skincare for Melanin-Rich Skin",
    "text": "[\n]( https://beautymatter.com/articles/motif-skincare-science-over-trends\n)\nDorion Renaud is a name that resonates with many, not just as a television personality and actor, but as a visionary entrepreneur who has made an indelible mark in the beauty industry. Known for his roles in BET’s College Hill and as a host on Extra, Renaud’s most loved and latest venture, Buttah Skin, has positioned him as a trailblazer in the world of skincare, particularly for melanin-rich skin. His brand, Buttah Skin, was built to serve not only as a testament to his entrepreneurial grit but also to become a beacon of inclusivity in an industry that has often overlooked the unique needs of [people of color](https://beautymatter.com/articles/politics-of-beauty-colorism).\nIn recent years, Buttah Skin, which kicked off in 2018, has grown from a passion project into a major player in the beauty world, securing spots on shelves at retailers like Ulta Beauty, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and HSN. Buttah Skin stands out in a crowded market because it was designed to cater to specific skincare concerns for people with darker skin tones like hyperpigmentation—concerns that many mainstream brands either ignore or fail to address adequately. In navigating this journey, Renaud’s personal experiences with problematic skin, his commitment to representation, and his determination to build a brand that speaks directly to Black and Brown consumers have all played a vital role in Buttah Skin’s success.\nRenaud’s journey into the world of skincare wasn’t a planned career move. It was born out of personal necessity. Growing up in Beaumont, Texas, Renaud struggled with skin issues, particularly as a young man trying to find his place in the world of entertainment. “I was dealing with acne, dark spots, uneven skin tone, all the things that come with having darker skin,” Renaud shares with BeautyMatter. “I was constantly in front of the camera, and I remember feeling embarrassed about my skin. It was tough, especially because I didn’t see a lot of products out there that were made for someone like me.”\nThis [lack of representation](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/black-representation-in-the-beauty-industry) in the beauty aisles struck a chord with Renaud, who, like many other Black men, found it difficult to find skincare solutions tailored to his specific concerns. Renaud’s early experiences in front of the camera—where every imperfection was magnified—pushed him to experiment with different products, eventually landing on a formula that worked for his skin. His personal concoction of shea butter [sourced directly from Ghana](https://beautymatter.com/articles/how-hanahana-beauty-built-a-community-led-brand), a vitamin C serum, and a gentle cleanser, became the foundation for what would later become Buttah Skin. “I thought, ‘Why not take what worked for me and make it available to people like me?’” Renaud said. “It was never just about selling products. It was about creating a solution for people who’ve been overlooked for so long. I knew there was a gap in the market, and I wanted to fill it.”\nThis focus on inclusivity is not just skin-deep. Buttah Skin’s product line is formulated specifically for melanin-rich skin, which tends to be more prone to hyperpigmentation, dryness, and uneven skin tone. For Renaud, addressing these concerns head-on was crucial to the brand’s success. “It’s not just about making products for the sake of it. It’s about solving problems that have been ignored by the larger beauty industry,” Renaud shared. “I wanted Buttah to be a celebration of melanin and to give it the glow it deserves.” One of the brand’s standout products is its Vitamin C Serum, which has garnered rave reviews for its ability to brighten the skin and fade dark spots—issues that disproportionately affect people with darker skin tones. By incorporating [natural, effective ingredients](https://beautymatter.com/articles/indigenous-african-ingredients-take-a-spot-on-beautys-global-stages) like [shea butter](https://beautymatter.com/articles/inside-africas-global-shea-butter-phenomenon), cocoa butter, and vitamin C, Buttah Skin has built a reputation for offering high-quality solutions for its target audience.\nNavigating the beauty industry as a Black entrepreneur comes with its own set of challenges, and Renaud was no stranger to the skepticism and pushback that often accompanied his business decisions. A notable example was when he decided to feature rapper 2 Chainz in one of Buttah Skin’s earliest campaigns. “There was a lot of resistance to that,” Renaud recalled. “People didn’t understand why I would put a Black rapper in a skincare campaign, but for me, it was about showing that there are so many different types of Black men, and they all deserve to be represented.”\nFor the brand, this decision wasn’t just about selling products. It was about changing the narrative around Black men and skincare. Historically, skincare has been predominantly viewed through the lenses of women, but Renaud saw a clear demand from Black men who were interested in taking care of their skin but didn’t always feel comfortable asking questions or seeking advice. “I saw so many men gravitating towards Buttah,” he said. “They wanted to take care of their skin, but they didn’t always have the confidence to ask. I wanted to shift the culture around men and self-care, especially for Black men.” This push for inclusivity and representation has been a cornerstone of Buttah Skin’s marketing strategy. By creating campaigns that feature a diverse range of skin tones, body types, and genders, Buttah has been positioned as a brand that truly embraces all facets of Black and Brown beauty. “Representation matters. When you see yourself reflected in a brand, it makes a difference. It tells you that you matter, that your skin and your concerns are valid,” Renaud says.\nUnlike many skincare brands that rely heavily on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements, Buttah Skin’s growth has been largely organic. Renaud’s hands-on approach to building the brand has resonated with consumers, many of whom first heard about Buttah Skin through word of mouth or personal interactions with Renaud himself. “In the beginning, I’d give products away for free. I’d leave boxes at hotels, or if I was traveling, I’d hand out products at the airport,” Renaud says. “I’d even go to Macy’s and sign boxes. It felt like album signings back in the day, but for skincare. People can tell when a brand is real, and they can tell when it’s just about money. For me, Buttah is personal. I’m not just selling products. I’m sharing my journey, my story, and my struggles with people who can relate.” This grassroots approach helped Buttah Skin build a loyal following, particularly among Black and Brown consumers. Today, the brand has built a cult following of over 300,000 followers on media platforms like Instagram.\nAs Buttah Skin continues to expand, Renaud has begun to rethink his role within the company. After several years of being deeply involved in every aspect of the business, from product development to marketing, he made the difficult decision to step down as CEO in October 2024, to focus on his personal life and future ventures. “I was wearing too many hats,” Renaud admitted. “I was trying to be the CEO, the face of the brand, and everything in between. It got to a point where I needed to step back and let the brand grow on its own.” Despite stepping down from the day-to-day operations, Renaud remains closely tied to Buttah Skin, remaining its founder and visionary. However, stepping back from the operational grind was essential for him to regain balance and explore new creative ventures. “I’ve given so much to Buttah, and I’ll always be a part of it,” Renaud explained. “But I needed to take a step back for my peace, my sanity, and to allow myself space to think about what comes next. Sometimes, we think we have to be in control of everything for it to succeed,” he adds, “but the reality is, if you’ve built something strong, you have to trust it to grow without you.”\nAs for what’s next for Renaud, the possibilities seem endless. He has already begun working on new projects, including a book about reinvention, a theme he is intimately familiar with. “I’ve had to reinvent myself so many times in my career—whether it was from acting to hosting to now being an entrepreneur,” Renaud said. “It’s a journey, and I want to share what I’ve learned with others, especially people who may be going through similar transitions.” The founder also hinted at expanding his footprint in the beauty industry, teasing the possibility of another skincare line in the future. “There’s still so much work to be done in terms of serving people of color in the beauty space,” he says. “I’m not done yet—I’ve just scratched the surface.”\nDorion Renaud’s story is one of resilience, reinvention, and representation. His journey from a small-town boy from Beaumont to building a skincare empire that celebrates melanin-rich beauty is not just about business but also of purpose and pride. With Buttah Skin, Renaud has proven that the beauty industry can and should be more inclusive, and that real change happens when people step up to fill the gaps they see in the world.\nWant to continue reading this article and others just like it?\nSubscribe to BeautyMatter and access the most current beauty intelligence and news updates.\nAlready a member, [login here](https://beautymatter.com/account/login).",

    "title": "The Motive for Haley’s Civil War Question: To Prove That Republicans Are Bigots",
    "text": "Courtesy of an obvious plant for the Democrats or a GOP rival who appeared at Nikki Haley’s recent town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, the new gotcha question for GOP political candidates is this: “What caused the Civil War?”\nAnd as Haley just learned, any answer but “slavery” will blow up like a plugged Confederate Howitzer at Vicksburg. And so the former South Carolina governor revised her remarks at another town hall. Why, yes, she said, “of course the Civil War was about slavery.”\nWell no, it wasn’t, but no other answer is possible in post-\nFloyd Hoax America. And the point of such a question is for GOP candidates to prove they are sufficiently “anti-racist.”\nAn incorrect answer proves quite the opposite.\nThe Question and Answers\nHaley’s initial answer was a rambling, libertarian non-answer.\n“Well don’t come with an easy question,” Haley began. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.”\nShe went downhill from there:\nI think it always comes down to the role of government. And what the rights of the people are. And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure we do all things so that individuals have the liberties, so that they can have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the way.\nHaley’s interlocutor was nonplussed. “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word ‘slavery,’”\nhe said.\n“What do you want me to say about slavery?” Haley replied.\nThe clip went viral. The damage was done. And Haley retreated.\n“Of course the Civil War was about slavery,” she said at another town hall. “We know that. That’s unquestioned. Always the case.”\nWe don’t know that, it isn’t unquestioned, and it isn’t always the case, but let Historian Haley go on:\nWe know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing, and whether government, economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more.\nBut the lessons of what that bigger issue with the Civil War are is that let’s not forget what came out of that, which is government’s role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way. That should be the goal of what we always try and take away from that, right, because we never want to return back to that place. But we always want to remember the the lesson of what it means to be a free individual, and that everyone deserves to be a free individual.\nSo we stand by that. I say that as a Southerner. I say that as Southern governor who removed the Confederate flag off the statehouse grounds, and I say that as a proud American of how far we have come.\nTraitor Joe Biden chimed in with one sentence over an X post of Haley’s video: “It was about slavery.”\nThat probably wasn’t the smart thing to say for a president from Delaware, a\nslave state through the Civil War, but anyway, the leftist media dutifully dashed off to Haley rival Ron DeSantis. He gave the right answer, and for good measure burbled a customary Conservatism, Inc., talking point.\n“Of course, you have the issue of slavery,” DeSantis said, noting that Southern states worried that President Lincoln would interfere with or eliminate it:\nThey viewed it as a states’ rights issue, not as a federal issue and they were concerned.… This Republican president may come in and get rid of the institution of slavery.… You know it’s interesting, because the Republican Party was founded to put a stop to the growth of slavery in this country. And the abolition of slavery was, to this day, remains the party’s top achievement. And it was a partisan achievement, because the people that were fighting Lincoln, the people that wanted to preserve [slavery] they were Democrats and so the Republican party did that. And that’s something that you should acknowledge and be proud of as a Republican.\nWhat Lincoln Said\nThe unfortunate truth for Haley, DeSantis, and Traitor Joe is that Lincoln’s principal object in waging the brutal, unnecessary war\nthat killed more than 600,000 Americans was preserving the Union. Or better yet, forcing the South to stay in it. Here is Honest Abe in a letter to Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune, who had complained that Lincoln had not announced Emancipation in 1862.\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the Union will be “the Union as it was.” If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. [Emphasis added]\nEnding slavery only became a war measure in 1863 when\nLincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in the hope that slaves would rebel in the South. The proclamation, which also permitted Lincoln to disingenuously claim that the war’s object was ending slavery, did not touch slavery) in the North, including, again, in Biden’s home state. Lincoln was a member of the American Colonization Society, wanted blacks shipped to Africa, and said so to a delegation of black leaders he met at the White House on August 14, 1862.\nDeSantis omitted those facts in his Democrats-are-the-real-racists rendition of history.\nAs for Haley, “as a Southerner,” she bragged about removing the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol. Let us not debate the question of whether the daughter of\nPunjabi Indian immigrants is a real “Southerner,” and simply observe that anyone with a brain sees that remark as a cynical, desperate attempt to prove her “anti-racist” bona fides.\nWhich returns us to the original point. That seems to be what every GOP candidate — and indeed what every Republican — must prove in\npost-Floyd Hoax America.\nProblem is, no such proof is possible.",
