    "title": "Tracking the Tropics: Invest 97L could develop before bringing heavy rain, potential flooding to Florida",
    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. - A tropical system known as Invest 97L is expected to bring heavy rain and wind to the Bay Area, with the strongest impacts starting Sunday. The National Hurricane Center says the system has a 60 percent chance of development over the next two days and a 90 percent chance in the next seven days. If it gets a name, it would be Debby. FOX 13 meteorologist Dave Osterberg says the system remains \"very, very disorganized\" as of Friday morning since it&apos;s moving over land. Once it moves into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, though, it will have a chance to develop as it approaches Florida. Osterberg says whether the disturbance develops or not, impacts will be felt statewide Sunday and Monday, with several inches of rain, potential flooding and tropical storm force wind gusts expected. Most computer models show a tropical storm near Florida&apos;s west coast around Sunday evening, but the storm&apos;s exact path and intensity could quickly change depending on how well organized it becomes and how much time it spends over water, according to Osterberg. Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for most Florida counties, including throughout the Bay Area. Sandbags are being offered beginning Friday in several locations, including in the City of St. Petersburg from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday through Sunday, weather permitting: Lake Maggiore Park Shelter Area – 3601 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. St. S.

    "text": "MOSCOW (AFP): President Vladimir Putin praised the Russian army in his New Year’s Eve address Sunday, calling for “unity” in a scaled-back speech that did not explicitly mention the conflict in Ukraine.\nIn stark contrast to last year, when the Kremlin chief was flanked by soldiers in uniform, Putin described 2024 as the “year of the family” in front of the traditional backdrop of the Kremlin.\n“We have repeatedly proved that we are able to solve the most difficult tasks and will never back down, because there is no force that can separate us,” Putin said in the address, aired on state TV.\n“To all those who are on duty, on the front line of the fight for truth and justice,” Putin said, “you are our heroes. Our hearts are with you. We are proud of you, we admire your courage.”\nThe televised New Year’s Eve speech, which continues a tradition started by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, is a holiday staple in Russia, watched in millions of households.\nIt is aired just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones, and is usually a summary of events of the past year as well as wishes for the year ahead.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#8](c8#c-8) Cuando esta misma justicia condena a los de alsasua, o a los titiriteros, o a los 6 de Zaragoza, etc., algunos aplaudís con las orejitas. Cuando pasa esto, ya es \"justicia\".\nPues la LIVG la firmaron TODOS, incluido el PP...\n[#11](c11#c-11) ¿en base a que me incluyes en ese grupo? Vaya un “y tú más” más patético, que lástima que tu mejor defensa sea inventarte lo que pienso, que además de ser mentira es una bobada doble, porque además de ser una burda mentira haces como si una injusticia más otra injusticia sumasen justicia, cuando lo que suma es doble injusticia.\nQue lamentable colega, en serio.\nTodo el neofeminismo gira en torno a esta idea: puesto que las mujeres tienen un miedo constante a que un hombre las viole o las maltrate, la igualdad que se busca es que todos los hombres tengan miedo también a encontrarse con una loca que les denuncie y vayan a la cárcel.\nPara ello se anulan los derechos que haya que anular, presunción de inocencia, necesidad de pruebas, etc...\nDe este modo se impone el criterio de una minoría de mujeres aterrorizadas sin justificación por los hombres que sólo quieren venganza disfrazada de una supuesta igualdad que es de todo menos eso.\nQue vayan saliendo todos los mierdecillas que siempre dicen que es falso que basta la palabra de una mujer para que te comas 10 años de trullo... No, que sigan escondidos como ratas que son, me conformo con que les pase a ellos y a su familiares.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Has escogido el caso más desafortunado posible para decir ese comentario. El tipo fue condenado, y solo ha conseguido la absolución cuando ELLA HA RECONOCIDO LA DENUNCIA FALSA.\nHa sido su palabra la que le metió en prisión y ha sido su palabra la que le ha sacado de ahí.\nHermano, date cuenta... al menos, en esta noticia, los mierdecillas esos de los que habla tienen más razón que tú\n[#15](c15#c-15) no creo que sea así. Si los jueces lo condenaron fue unicamente por la palabra de la tiparraca... y esto le puede pasar a cualquiera, los jueces no tienen en cuenta más que eso. La confesión posterior, que puede ocurrir o no, dependiendo de muchos factores, lo unico que hace es dejarlo más claro todavía. Los jueces solo tienen en cuenta la palabra de una loca, porque no pueden existir otras pruebas al ser una denuncia falsa. Si la tipa no tiene remordimiento o teme simplemente las consecuencias de haber mentido al tribunal, o el miedo a que familiares y amigos sepan la verdad ... el tio se come los 10 añitos, que es lo que estara pasando en la mayoría de los casos.\n[#0](c0#c-0) no es esta?\nHe podido leer la sentencia del TSJ que ha absuelto a este hombre de violación",

    "text": "MMRDA to levy daily fines on contractors for labour shortage\nEffective immediately, the new policy would be applicable for all MMRDA worksites, though priority would be given to Metro rail corridors, especially lines 9, 4, 4A and 2B which are slated to be commissioned by year-end\nMumbai: With four metro rail projects scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2025, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Wednesday introduced a new penalty policy, whereby contractors will be fined ₹1-2 lakh per day for shortage of manpower at worksites.\n“We have appointed dedicated team leaders for each metro package, which has made a measurable difference in site progress. This new policy is the next logical step,” said Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA.\n“We have observed that currently, most infrastructure and metro rail projects have 40-60% of the sanctioned labour force working. So we have framed this penalty policy,” an MMRDA official told Hindustan Times.\nEffective immediately, the new policy would be applicable for all MMRDA worksites, though priority would be given to Metro rail corridors, especially lines 9, 4, 4A and 2B which are slated to be commissioned by year-end.\nA 25-50% shortfall in manpower will attract a penalty of ₹1 lakh per day while a shortfall above 50% will attract ₹2 lakh per day as penalty, an MMRDA official told Hindustan Times. “No prior notice or exceptions would be made and delivery timelines would be non-negotiable,” the official said. Fines for shortage of manpower would be levied in addition to fines for missed deadlines, the official clarified.\nAll ongoing metro projects have been assigned to senior officials who will be responsible for monitoring them and ensuring their timely completion, said sources in the planning authority. Designated officials will conduct periodic site audits and manpower reviews to identify any labour shortfall, besides scrutinising reports submitted by general consultants overseeing the projects, they said.\nLabour shortage was a major problem during the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected construction work for the metro 2A and metro 7 corridors, said MMRDA officials.\n“Recently, there was a shortage of workers for Metro 2B, for which fines were levied. Metro corridors 9, 7A, 5 and 4 too have labour shortage problems, especially during the summer when workers return to their hometowns. Contractors will have to find ways to manage such situations,” said a senior MMRDA official.\nBut contractors were sceptical about the new policy.\n“With infrastructure works including metro rail corridors being built across the country, there is no doubt that there is a shortage of workers in the market,” a contractor with several projects in the Mumbai metropolitan region told Hindustan Times. “Besides, workers go home during the festival seasons, which further delays work. These factors need to be considered rather than simply levying fines.”\nThe MMRDA has, in the past, levied penalties worth ₹1.29 crore on contractors for delays in civil works, roofing and structural works for the metro 2B corridor. In 2024, penalties worth ₹2.75 crore were levied for leakages in metro projects, missed deadlines and accidents on site.\nExplore now!\nStay updated with all the\nBreaking Newsand\nLatest Newsfrom\nMumbai.

[Calling](https://x.com/Ssanchez_16/status/1836626294504849664) Sánchez \"an incredible human being...[who's] a pleasure to coach,\" Wave boss Landon Donovan [told the post-match press corps](https://x.com/sandiegowavefc/status/1836810106639733070) that his entire team was \"awesome\" last night. \"To go down two goals and just continue to believe and keep playing and putting them under pressure was awesome.

The sixth-place Thorns have yet to earn a point on the [NWSL table](https://www.nwslsoccer.com/standings/regular-season) since returning from the Olympic break. When asked about the usually dominant Thorns’ [recent downfall](https://justwomenssports.com/reads/unbeaten-orlando-pride-make-nwsl-history-washington-spirit-clinch-playoffs-spot/#:~:text=Portland%20Thorns%20continue%20late%2Dseason%20NWSL%20losing%20streak), Portland's [new permanent head coach](https://www.thorns.com/news/portland-thorns-fc-name-rob-gale-as-head-coach) Rob Gale [said](https://x.com/tayvincent6/status/1836624667060387855) \"We need to get healthy bodies available for 90 minutes.\" With forward Morgan Weaver on limited minutes as she works back to full form following a May knee surgery, and Smith joining her in being pulled at halftime last night with what Gale [called](https://x.com/tayvincent6/status/1836619877567860970) \"some lower body problems,\" Portland's attack suffered in the tilt. That said, the lopsided affair also saw mental errors, with the Thorns scrambling for possession and excessively fouling — mistakes Portland hopes to eliminate before hosting San Diego in NWSL play in nine days. Where to watch Concacaf W Champions Cup group play tonight Halfway through the international club tournament’s four-match group stage, the Wave now leads Group B while Portland sits in third. The top two teams in each group will advance to May’s semifinals.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save PENDLETON, Ore. -- It seems every town in America has at least one iconic hamburger drive-in. And in Pendleton, locals will tell you theirs is Hal's Hamburgers.They made their first burger in 1952 and they've been sizzling ever since. For more than 70 years, Hal's has been at its location on Pendleton's SE Court Street, serving traditional drive-up food with a side of nostalgia.If you close your eyes, you can almost imagine the Fonz and Richie Cunningham munching on some fries here.\"Predominantly hamburgers. We have chicken, like fried chicken, crispy chicken, grilled chicken, salads, sandwiches, anything,\" said Cindy Spiess, owner of Hal's Hamburgers.RELATED: Oregon Grain Growers Brand Distillery in Pendleton offers farm-to-table spiritsRELATED: Phodery in Phoenix brings a food truck lot feel, but with so much moreThat kind of thing is sometimes exactly what we crave. But don’t call Hal’s Hamburgers fast food.\"But we get to have a good conversation with them while they're here waiting for their food, because everything's made to order. So it's not Taco Time. Not to throw other people under the bus, but it's not a fast food restaurant. So we have a little bit of time with the customers, and I think they enjoy that. When they leave, they feel good,\" Spiess explained. \"They like their food and they've had a fun conversation with the staff.\"When Hal's opened in 1952, Court Street was a narrow little roadway. As the town and the road have grown, the restaurant now sits closer to the roadway. In fact, it looks much like it did back in the day because the city of Pendleton says if they modify any part of the building, they have to move the entire restaurant back. That’s no easy feat. So it remains as is.\"The restaurant itself, as you can see, is super small,\" Spiess said. \"A little tiny lobby for like six people to sit down.\"RELATED: This is the go-to place for breakfast in Ashland, OregonRELATED: Grateful Bread in Pacific City combines breakfast, baked goods and a Deadhead vibeI remember coming by as a kid with my grandparents. We’d stop, and we’d get an ice cream or a milkshake. And Hal's is really known for the milkshake.\"Oh, yes. We had a gentleman come through last week, and he traveled the whole world. He said, ‘I’ve been through Europe and Malaysia, everywhere around the world.’ He said, ‘These are the best milkshakes we’ve ever had.’ And I thought, ‘Wow, that’s saying something, right?’” Spiess said.The milkshakes: 52 flavors to choose from, or you can make your own combo.\"And then you can combine flavors. You can get two flavors together or three flavors together. And then we have a quart-sized shake, which always surprises me. Somebody will get like a monster burger and a quart-sized shake. And I’m thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that shake would fill you up for like two days,’” Spiess said.What’s the top-selling item?\"Probably just the bacon cheeseburger and Huckleberry Shake,\" said Spiess.Hal’s Hamburgers is open daily, closed only on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The next time you find yourself driving through Pendleton, swing by Hal’s Hamburgers. It’s right where it has been for more than 70 years.

Около 22:15 на улице Лебедева возле дома №5 из-под земли начал бить фонтан воды, что потребовало экстренного отключения водоснабжения.\nБез холодной воды остались девять многоквартирных домов по улицам Лебедева и Ключевской, три коммерческих объекта и центральный тепловой пункт. Аварийная бригада МУП \"Водоканал\" оперативно выехала на место и за час с небольшим устранила повреждение на стальной трубе диаметром 200 мм, установив специальный ремонтный хомут. Уже к 23:30 водоснабжение было полностью восстановлено, а на время ремонта жителям организовали подвоз питьевой воды.\nПараллельно с этим пришлось ограничить подачу горячей воды в нескольких домах и социальных учреждениях, включая детский сад \"Колокольчик\" и медицинский центр \"Нефро Диал\". Это было связано с необходимостью проведения ремонтных работ на сетях, питающих ЦТП-21/1. Однако и здесь коммунальщики справились оперативно - уже через час горячая вода снова пошла в краны жителей.\nДанные о правообладателе фото и видеоматериалов взяты с сайта «MK.RU Улан-Удэ» , подробнее в Правилах сервиса Источник: MK.RU Улан-Удэ Темы: ЖКХ",
