    "text": "AMERICANS can score up to $48,000 from a massive $92.5 million lawsuit settlement. The compensation comes from New York City after claims that plaintiffs were held in custody longer than legally allowed. Anyone who was detained by the New York City Department of Correction past their scheduled release date may be able to cash in from the settlement. The lawsuit covers people held past their scheduled release between April 1, 1997, and December 21, 2012, solely due to ICE detainer requests. ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - enforces immigration laws and handles the detention and removal of individuals in the US. If all other conditions for release were met - yet you were held solely due to an ICE detainer - you may be entitled to compensation. Several requirements must be fulfilled to be eligible to get a portion of the funds. The settlement identifies two main groups: the Statute of Limitations Group and the Recent Group. The Statute of Limitations Group includes those detained past release from April 1, 1997, to January 31, 2007. The Recent Group includes those detained past release between February 1, 2007, and December 21, 2012. According to the class action lawsuit, the Department of Correction allegedly detained individuals longer than legally allowed based solely on ICE detainer requests. The New York City Department of Correction oversees the city's prisons and rehabilitation programs. Plaintiffs say that, based on ICE’s own guidelines, the department only had the authority to hold someone for up to 48 hours due to an ICE detainer - but often exceeded that time limit. Although New York City denies any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the $92.5 million settlement to resolve the allegations. Exact payouts will vary depending on how many days a person was unlawfully held and how many people submit valid claims. According to the settlement website, Recent Group members may get between $20,000 and $48,000 on average. Statute of Limitations Group members are expected to get between $10,000 and $24,000 on average. The deadline to request exclusion from or object to the settlement is May 15, 2025. The final court hearing to approve the settlement is October 6, 2025. To receive compensation, you must submit a valid claim form by May 15, 2025.",

    "text": "The number of global terrorist attacks planned by Iran against Jews and Israelis since October 7 has more than doubled compared to the previous year, according to sources from the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency. The Jerusalem Post reports that Mossad has prevented more than 50 attempted attacks worldwide in recent months, significantly up from the 27 incidents thwarted in 2023.\nMany of these foiled attacks have not been made public, demonstrating Iran’s heightened efforts to target Jews and Israelis across the globe. Tehran has been increasingly motivated, pouring extensive resources into planning such attacks.\nMossad has often worked in collaboration with foreign intelligence agencies, sometimes even in countries that do not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel. In other instances, the Mossad has acted independently. Some of the countries where these efforts have taken place include Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, and Turkey. In May, Mossad also revealed it had helped prevent attacks in Sweden and Belgium.\n( YWN World Headquarters – NYC )",

A maximum number of road accident fatalities, accounting for 26 per cent of the total accident fatalities in the state, were reported between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. in 2022, while, at least 75 per cent of the accident fatalities occurred in rural areas of the state. As per the socio-economic cost analysis, in Punjab the accidents accounted for a loss of Rs 21,517 crore in 2022. The decline in road fatalities in the state is against the countrywide trend, which has witnessed an increase of 9.4 per cent in road fatalities in 2022, resulting in 1,68,491 road accident fatalities in India. DGP Yadav, while launching the Annual Report on Punjab Road Crashes and Traffic-2022, said this declining trend is likely to be accelerated with the launch of the first-of-its-kind Sadak Surkhiya Force (SSF), a special police team dedicated towards road safety and effectively chasing criminals. \"The SSF, a brainchild of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, is expected to hit the roads soon, which will not only help in saving precious lives by reducing mishaps but will also streamline the traffic movement in the state,\" he said. The DGP urged the public to follow road safety rules and regulations to make the roads of Punjab safer. Divulging more details, ADGP (Traffic) A.S. Rai said this annual report on Punjab Road Crashes and Traffic -- 2022 is an initiative taken by the Punjab Police and Punjab Road Safety and Traffic Research Centre. It comprises an in-depth analysis of road accidents, traffic violations, and road safety measures in Punjab, he added.",
