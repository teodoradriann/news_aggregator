    "text": "New Delhi: The El Nino weather phenomenon, which led to the erratic monsoon in 2023 that hit India’s agricultural sector, is still active in the Pacific Ocean where it originates, but is expected to withdraw during April-June this year which is a good sign for the Indian economy.\nThe US’s Climate Prediction Centre has stated in its latest forecast on January 11 that “collectively, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system reflected a strong and mature El Nino”.\nHowever, it concluded: “El Nino is expected to continue for the next several seasons, with ENSO-neutral favoured during April-June 2024 (73 per cent chance).”\nEENSO neutral refers to normal surface sea temperatures (75-80 degrees Fahrenheit) and is generally associated with fairly normal weather patterns. The Climate Prediction Center carries out regular reviews of the complex ocean-atmosphere system for its forecasts.\nEl Nino is viewed with concern in India as it disrupts the monsoon leading to drought in certain parts of the country and often excess rain in others as happened in 2023.\nAlthough the exact impact that the ocean currents in the Pacific will have on the Indian monsoon will become clearer in the months ahead, news of El Nino turning neutral during April-June could mean that this phenomenon would abate and not disrupt the monsoon.\nHistorically, more than half of El Nino years have caused droughts during the monsoon, with all-India rainfall falling below 90 per cent of the long-period average.\nA normal monsoon is critical for India’s agricultural sector, with 52 per cent of the net cultivated area depending on it. The monsoon rains also play a crucial role in replenishing the water levels in the country’s reservoirs across states which can be used for irrigation for the next crop season.\nRain-fed areas produce nearly 90 per cent of millets, 80 per cent of oilseeds and pulses, 60 per cent of cotton and support nearly 40 per cent of India’s population and more than half the livestock.\nIn 2023, India experienced ‘below normal’ rains and an abnormally dry August largely due to El Niño conditions. The monsoon had got off to a delayed start in June after which there was excess rain in July followed by a deficit in August and then excess rains in September again in certain parts of the country, such as Punjab and Haryana, which hit the standing crop.\nThis resulted in a sharp increase in the prices of vegetables, especially tomatoes and onions that triggered a spike in inflation and stretched household budgets.\nThe erosion in farmers’ incomes has a cascading effect on industry as well since the demand for tractors sold by companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra and two-wheelers marketed by auto majors like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj comes down.\nRising prices of rice, wheat, pulses and spices push up the rate of inflation and stretch household budgets leaving less money to spend on industrial goods.\nThe government also intervened to keep prices in check by banning exports of wheat and non-basmati rice and onions. This again leads to a drop in farm incomes and also exports which earn vital foreign exchange.\nThe high inflation rate caused by a spike in food prices also forces the RBI to increase interest rates, which, in turn, has a dampening impact on economic growth as loans for industry and consumers turn costlier.\nIANS\n[Suggest A Correction](javascript:void(0);)",

    "text": "Local woman with rare disease spearheading effort to educate more people about handicapped parking spots\nCLINTON, CT. (WFSB) - A local woman with a rare disease is leading an effort to draw awareness to an issue that’s important to her and others who need access to handicapped parking spots.\nAlex Bode started a charity called “Peace, Love, and Accessibility.” It will receive some of the funds raised in Saturday’s Denise D’Ascenzo Foundation Walk to Fight Rare Diseases.\nShe has a rare condition known as “Friedrich’s Ataxia.” Her brother Sam also has it.\n“Alex has been living with Friedrich’s Ataxia for I don’t even know how many years. You’re 34. 35. And really was diagnosed at age 6. And was determined. And what is amazing to me is Friedrich’s Ataxia is a slowly progressive illness which is good and it’s bad,” said their mother, Mary. “Bad because it’s progressive. It’s good because as you’re losing abilities, you know, as a family we would mourn that loss, gather ourselves up, and move on.”\nDespite her physical challenges, Alex’s mind is sharp and her desire to advocate for others in situations like hers is strong.\n“She has her Master’s Degree in social work. And she always wanted to help people. So we sat down one day and we decided that she needs to think about what she could do to help others. And we came up with the idea. Accessibility is really important to her,” continued Mary.\nThe first thing Alex did when she founded the charity was create a survey about access to handicapped spots and people’s understanding of how they are and should be used.\n“One of the first things Al did was send out a survey, um, to placard users, non-placard users, police departments and physicians. To try to gather information,” said Mary.\nCaptain Ken Cain of the Clinton Police Department was one of those who Alex asked to take the survey.\n“Surprisingly when I took it there was a lot of information in there that I wasn’t aware of. So it kind of piqued my interest and they asked for some help and I how to, how to get into police departments to get some information across and right away I thought it was a great idea and decided to sit down and hear them out,” he said.\nHe agreed to pilot a program in town to educate his officers on the handicapped spots and to bring awareness about who should and shouldn’t be using them.\n“So the officers were able to observe that some of these placards were not valid. They were there’s lifetime placards that are no longer in use that we saw on people’s vehicles. Temporary placards. We, we found people using placards that didn’t belong to them. They belonged to a deceased relative and they were continuing to use these placards,” continued Cain.\nInstead of tickets, most often those who are improperly parked will get a courtesy card put on their car that Alex created, specifying the reason they are not allowed to park in the handicapped spot.\nIt could be because the vehicle has a placard that’s expired, a lifetime placard that is no longer valid, no placard at all, or they’re blocking cross-hatched lines that offer space for the ramps to extend to allow for wheelchairs to roll out.\nSo far, Alex, her mom, and her brother have visited a dozen police departments to educate them about the parking challenges they face. Sam is part of those conversations, sharing his experiences and frustrations.\n“I help Alex with whatever she needs so I go to different police with her and my mother. And I’m very, I’m very proud of both of them,” he said.\nMary said that people using expired or borrowed placards is a bigger problem than people parking in the spots who don’t have placards.\nAny placard with a wheelchair sitting up straight means that it is expired. Also, the lifetime placards that were issued more than a decade ago are no longer valid.\nThe updated placards being issued now have a wheelchair featuring a person leaning forward.\nAlex and her team from the foundation will be at the walk Saturday and will also benefit in part from the funds raise.\nTo sign up, click HERE.\nCopyright 2025 WFSB.

    "text": "Prosecutors want a reversal after a Texas woman's voter fraud conviction was overturned\nProsecutors in Texas asked the state’s highest criminal appeals court on Thursday to reverse a ruling that overturned a Fort Worth woman’s voter fraud conviction and five-year prison term for casting an illegal provisional ballot\nFORT WORTH, Texas -- Prosecutors in Texas asked the state's highest criminal appeals court on Thursday to reverse a ruling that overturned a Fort Worth woman's voter fraud conviction and five-year prison term for casting an illegal provisional ballot.\nLast month, Crystal Mason's illegal voting conviction was overturned by the Second Court of Appeals. Now the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office is asking the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to reverse that ruling.\nMason was convicted in 2018 of illegal voting in district court. Prosecutors maintained that Mason read and signed an affidavit accompanying the provisional ballot affirming that she had “fully completed” her sentence if convicted of a felony.\nBut the Second Court of Appeals ruled that even if she read the words on the affidavit, she may not have known that being on probation for a previous felony conviction left her ineligible to vote in 2016.\nTommy Buser-Clancy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has been one of Mason's representatives in the case, said in a statement that the request for further review of Mason’s case was “disappointing,” but they were “confident that justice will ultimately prevail.”\n“The court of appeals’ decision was well reasoned and correct. It is time to give Ms. Mason peace with her family,” Buser-Clancy said.\nThe ACLU of Texas said Mason wasn't doing interviews on Thursday.\nMason, a former tax preparer, had been convicted in 2012 on charges related to inflating refunds for clients and served nearly three years of a five-year sentence in prison. Then she was placed on a three-year term of supervised release and had to pay $4.2 million in restitution, according to court documents.\nMason’s long sentence made both state Republican and Democratic lawmakers uneasy. In 2021, after passing a new voting law measure over Democrats’ objections, the GOP-controlled state House approved a resolution stating that “a person should not be criminally incarcerated for making an innocent mistake.”\nTexas is among dozens of states that prevent felons from voting even after they leave prison.",

    "text": "Although Israel remains at war as with combat ensuing deep in the Gaza Strip, IDF soldiers contribute on all fronts of the war, Kan 11 reported on Thursday.In a series of interviews with the Israeli public broadcaster, soldiers from the Nahal Brigade tell their stories from October 7, fighting in Gaza, and the joys and challenges of picking grapefruit on Moshav Zimrat in southern Israel. ;Ron, a soldier from the Nahal Brigade's 50th Battalion, speaks of the ongoing struggle of farmers and agricultural workers. &ldquo;Since October 7, manpower has decreased and the trees continue to bear fruit, which needs to be taken care of. If we have the chance to help out, we will. Why not?\"console.log(\"BODY2. CatId is:\"+catID);if(catID==120){ console.log(\"BODY.

On Moshav Zimrat, there are 1,500 dunams of agriculture and cultivation to be worked. Kahlon said that &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pick all of my crops, so our soldiers come to us to help when they get breaks.&rdquo; ;The Nahal Brigade's commitment to volunteering ;The Nahal Brigade has storied ties to kibbutzim and moshavim in Israel, with many of the Brigade's soldiers having volunteered with agricultural movements. The symbol of the Nahal Brigade is the sickle, which suggests a long-standing connection of fighting in the IDF alongside working the lands of Israel. ; The funeral of Col. Sharon Asman, Nahal Brigade commander who died after collapsing during fitness training last week, in Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery, July 4, 2021. (credit: AVSHALOM SASSONI/FLASH90)The soldiers from the Nahal Brigade who came to volunteer that day were successful in picking fruit that fill 40 containers &ndash; all before lunch break. They told Kan 11 of how they&rsquo;d learned lots about agriculture, and ; joked about how many fruits they had eaten in the process.However, the soldiers also discussed the difficulties they&rsquo;ve faced in combat. In December, soldiers from the Nahal Brigade waged fierce battles against terrorists in an orchard in the Gaza Strip, and just last week, they were fighting in northern Gaza. They also touched upon their difficulties in being far from home. Liam, a Nahal soldier, confided in Kan 11 about the agricultural labor, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit difficult, but we know that important work is being done here, and it&rsquo;s a good way to decompress after being in Gaza. What is difficult is the uncertainty &ndash; are we going home or not? We&rsquo;re not going home tomorrow. Are we going to see our parents? We won&rsquo;t see them. That&rsquo;s the hardest part.&rdquo;Difficulties in the wake of October 7The soldiers spoke of those they&rsquo;d lost from their battalion on October 7 and since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. For them, it is difficult to leave Gaza and go home, as they feel torn about going out to see friends and have fun, but also going to visit graves of those they had lost. ;Another soldier opened up that he left Gaza after an extended period in combat to visit home in Ra&rsquo;anana, when there was a terrorist attack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not safe, there is always a threat of one kind or another. We&rsquo;re always alert.&rdquo;In the coming days, the soldiers will return to their missions in Gaza, but they will also put their weapons aside to pick grapefruit in the orchard. ;",
