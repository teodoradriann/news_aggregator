    "title": "Extraño comportamiento de ardillas ha causado preocupación en California, algunas se han vuelto «carnívoras»",
    "text": "Un estudio reciente sorprendió a los científicos al documentar un comportamiento inesperado en las ardillas terrestres de California (EEUU): cazan y devoran ratones.\nEste hallazgo, publicado en el Journal of Ethology, reveló que el 42 % de las interacciones observadas entre ardillas y ratones implicaban caza activa.\nLEA TAMBIÉN: [PARA VER VARIAS VECES: EL IMPRESIONANTE ESPECTÁCULO DE DRONES EN EEUU QUE ROMPIÓ UN RÉCORD GUINNESS](https://caraotadigital.net/usa/para-ver-varias-veces-el-impresionante-espectaculo-de-drones-en-eeuu-que-rompio-un-record-guinness/)\nLa autora principal del estudio, Jennifer E. Smith, de la Universidad de Wisconsin-Eau Claire, describió el descubrimiento como «impactante» y destacó que nunca antes se había visto este comportamiento en estas criaturas tan familiares.\nLas observaciones se realizaron durante el verano boreal en el Parque Regional Briones, donde los investigadores registraron 74 interacciones entre ardillas y ratones entre junio y julio.\nEste comportamiento carnívoro alcanzó su punto máximo en las primeras dos semanas de julio, coincidiendo con un aumento en la población de ratones.\nSonja Wild, coautora del estudio e investigadora posdoctoral en la Universidad de California en Davis, admitió que inicialmente se mostró escéptica ante las observaciones de los estudiantes universitarios. Sin embargo, señaló que al investigar más a fondo, confirmó que las ardillas cazaban activamente.\nEste comportamiento sugiere que las ardillas son omnívoras oportunistas, capaces de adaptarse a cambios en su entorno.\nLa capacidad de cazar y consumir carne podría ser una estrategia clave para su supervivencia en áreas urbanas donde la disponibilidad de alimentos varía.\nLos investigadores esperan que este estudio ayude a comprender mejor la historia natural de las ardillas y su impacto en los ecosistemas locales.",

    "text": "Detectives have released more details about a Lauderhill Police officer who has been charged with video voyeurism .\nLauderhill Police Officer Johnny Alejandro Mateo was arrested at work on Tuesday by Sunrise Police. He faces one count of digital voyeurism.\nInvestigators said they received a complaint from his live-in girlfriend.\nAccording to the arrest report, she told police that she met the suspect several years ago in the Dominican Republic, and he offered to help her with her immigration status.\nThe report states Mateo and the woman moved into a house in Sunrise, and she told detectives that the two had been on and off for several years.\nThe report further states the woman had a suspicion that “Johnny was cheating on her,” and “she found two USB drives in the kitchen.”\nWhen she looked at the drives, the report states there was a video of the two of them having sex in the master bedroom that “was recorded without her consent.”\nThe woman stated that her boyfriend has asked to record her several times, and she said no.\nThe police report states one of the USB drives shows Mateo “turning on the camera” while the victim is also in the room and is “oblivious” to the recording device.\nFurthermore, the police report states, Mateo’s girlfriend said “there were numerous other women in separate videos on the two USB jump drives,” adding that “she doesn’t know them personally or have their names.”\nMateo has worked for Lauderhill Police since 2017. Several years ago, he was promoted to detective of the department’s traffic homicide division.\nMatwo was booked into the Broward County Jail and released on a $5,000 bond.",

    "title": "Healthy Relationships: What Makes a Relationship or Marriage Happy?",
    "text": "When it comes to love, many wish for a happy relationship. A partner of full respect, understanding and harmony. But a loving relationship is a two-way street, which means that both parties need to work hard. Countless things have been written about how to recognize a bad relationship... you need to get away from manipulative behavior, a partner who controls you too much, belittles you and doesn't respect your boundaries. One should get away from the one who does not encourage your ancestor and who does not support you. Of course, you are also expected not to have such problematic behaviors. It's not enough to just 'find' each other, you have to make an effort, and every happy couple has gone through some storms. Maybe it wasn't always a fairy tale, but just such situations made them stronger. The concept of a healthy relationship is quite broad because people have different expectations. Over the years, priorities may change. However, there are several clear indicators that a relationship is healthy. Honest communication Couples in happy relationships are willing to talk about a variety of topics. They like to share what happens to them - even if it's bad. They do not know taboos, they are casual and open. It's hard for them to imagine a day when they don't talk about small things from work, plans, stress or interesting anecdotes. In short: they share the little things of life and know that their partner will not judge them even if they have opposite opinions. It is desirable to talk with your partner about (almost) everything and strive to be friends first and foremost. When a problem arises, it should be communicated without drama. On the other hand, it is desirable to get to know each other again and again and plan together. Confidence What is a relationship without trust? And without openness and honesty, there is no trust. Trust is built over time and through words and actions. Happy couples have no secrets, trust each other at their word and are not jealous or suspicious. They feel comfortable and safe and know that their partner will not hurt them. They are very supportive of each other and always respect each other's wishes. Autonomy Both parties have the right to make decisions and feel equal. No belittling or imposing. Couples in happy relationships appreciate quality time spent and bonding moments, but they are aware that they both need to have some time for themselves. The relationship does not suffocate them but fills them up. They cherish social lives and know how to judge when it's time to separate for a while. They have their own society and hobbies. Although they are together, they are still individuals who respect the space of freedom and boundaries. Playfulness Regardless of life's troubles, it's great when your partner is the one you laugh with. Time together could relax you and remind you that life is beautiful. So don't forget about yourself and try to get out of the routine at least for a while. For example, try a joint sports activity or go on a trip. Laugh and try to get closer. Teamwork Happy couples function like a team. They respect each other and strive to progress together. In short, they have each other's backs. They know that their partner is there for them, but that they both need to contribute. A healthy sex life Of course, sex is also an integral part of a healthy relationship. It is not good when the relationship is reduced to sex, but it is also not good when there is no sex, because it often leads to frustrations. Happy couples try to talk about everything, including intimacy. They freely discuss their wishes and mutual satisfaction is important to them. They respect the moments when one party is not interested in sex and try to keep the passion alive. With them, there is no pressure that intercourse has to happen. Boundaries are respected. They don't forget about gentle touches, kisses or joint activities that remind them that they care. Conflict resolution Not everything is always perfect, so the couple must know how to solve the problem. Although they don't always agree, they don't turn their heads away from the problem. They try to settle the dispute peacefully. Partners who resolve conflict without judgment or contempt can often find a compromise or solution. And that is the most important thing. And - are you in a happy relationship? If you find yourself in this, you're on the right track. Bonus video:",

Así se decide”, reza la sentencia que la leyó presidenta del Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela (TSJ), Caryslia Rodríguez. El Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela ratificó el 2 de agosto la victoria del presidente Nicolás Maduro con cerca del 51,95 por ciento de los votos frente al 43,18 por ciento obtenido por el opositor Edmundo González Urrutia. Tras el anuncio de los resultados preliminares que dieron como ganador al candidato del Gran Polo Patriótico, la ultraderecha venezolana, liderada por la cabecilla opositora María Corina Machado, llamó a sus partidarios a desconocer el triunfo del actual mandatario, lo que dio lugar a protestas violentas y actos vandálicos en varias ciudades del país sudamericano. Por su parte, los Gobiernos de Estados Unidos y de otros países latinoamericanos han cuestionado la legitimidad del proceso y han reclamado la victoria del abanderado de la extrema derecha. En este escenario, el Gobierno venezolano ha denunciado los intentos de Washington y sus aliados de promover un golpe de Estado, al considerar como ganador en los comicios a González Urrutia.",

    "text": "INGRAM, Texas — Ingram Fire Department has transitioned from emergency flood response to long-term rebuilding efforts after an overwhelming community response met their immediate disaster relief needs, Chief Diana Baccus announced.\nThe change follows what Baccus described as a “tidal wave of love, support and generosity” from people both locally and from afar. The department’s Amazon wishlist has been updated from emergency response items to essential everyday supplies needed for ongoing operations and community service.\n“Over the past few days, we have been overwhelmed — not just by the floodwaters that shook our community, but by the tidal wave of love, support and generosity that followed,” Baccus wrote in the department’s newsletter.\nDespite the personal and operational challenges caused by the devastating flood, Baccus emphasized the department’s commitment to serving its community.\n“We are not just firefighters. We are sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, friends and neighbors. And this community? It is everything to us,” she said.\nThe department has established official donation channels to help supporters contribute safely. Information about legitimate donation links and the updated Amazon wishlist has been pinned to the top of their social media page, along with warnings about fraudulent accounts trying to exploit the disaster.\n“Unfortunately, there are fraudulent accounts trying to take advantage of your kindness,” Baccus said, urging people to report suspicious activity directly to the department.\nThough it is difficult to ask for help, Baccus expressed gratitude for the community’s response.\n“Though it is never easy for us to ask for help, we have been flooded — this time with kind offers and messages asking how to donate or support our mission,” she wrote.\nBaccus called the flooding “devastating” for both the department and local families but praised the community’s resilience.\n“This event has been devastating, not just to our department, but to our families and neighbors. Still, through the heartbreak, through the exhaustion, and through the tears — we continue to rise together,” she said.\nThe department continues to receive messages from supporters asking how to help during what Baccus called “this unimaginable time.” Those interested in supporting rebuilding efforts can find official donation information pinned to the top of the department’s social media page.",
