    "text": "El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, ordenó este jueves una \"acción defensiva\" en el océano Atlántico en respuesta a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a las costas de Guyana, lo que ha disparado nuevamente la tensión entre los países suramericanos por su disputa territorial. \"He ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB) sobre el Caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensivo como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país\", dijo el mandatario. El anuncio lo hizo frente a la cúpula militar, durante una reunión que fue transmitida de manera obligatoria en la radio y televisión, en la que se comunicó con un grupo de efectivos castrenses que concretaron \"la primera fase\" de esta operación, lo que consistió en un despliegue sobre tierra y aguas del estado Sucre (noreste). Maduro no dio detalles sobre el alcance y duración de esta operación pero insistió en que la llegada del HMS Trent británico es una \"amenaza inaceptable\" que supone una \"ruptura\" de los acuerdos que suscribió con su homólogo guyanés, Irfaan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre, cuando se comprometieron a no amenazarse mutuamente y evitar incidentes relacionadas con la disputa. \"Venezuela no se puede quedar de brazos cruzados frente a una amenaza, estamos respondiendo en la medida proporcional\", aseguró tras reiterar que apuesta por la diplomacia y la paz. El líder chavista criticó que Guyana haya desoído las peticiones de Caracas de no aceptar la llegada del barco británico a sus costas. Minutos antes, el Gobierno venezolano había condenado este hecho en un comunicado, en el que pidió a Georgetown \"tomar acciones inmediatas para el retiro del buque y abstenerse de seguir involucrando potencias militares en la controversia\". La disputa escaló después de que Venezuela aprobara el 3 de diciembre, en un referendo unilateral, anexionarse la zona bajo pleito, un área de casi 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados que está bajo control de Guyana y que actualmente discute la Corte Internacional de Justicia.

    "text": "First severe bird flu case in the US reported\nDoctors across the country are growing concerned about the spread of bird flu.\n\"The concern comes today because we've checked one of those boxes, the severity of illness, and that's something that we had not seen in the prior cases this year,\" said Dr. Jeremy Faust, a Harvard emergency medicine professor.\nA patient in Louisiana is hospitalized in critical condition with the nation's first known severe illness from bird flu.\nHealth officials report the patient is older than 65, has underlying medical problems, and was exposed to a backyard flock of sick birds.\nSo far, more than 60 people in eight states have experienced mild illness related to the virus.\nAnd while it's named \"bird flu,\" it's really affecting dairy cows, infecting at least 866 herds in 16 states since March.\nMore than half of those cases are in California, where the governor declared an emergency.\n\"We have lots of ways we're monitoring it. We're hopeful that the emergency declaration will make some of those ways more streamlined,\" said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, deputy public health officer for Solano County, California.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people in contact with dairy cows, commercial poultry, or backyard birds are at higher risk.\nThere has been no person-to-person transmission identified.\nThe virus can also spread in raw milk.\n\"I think, given this situation, it makes sense to have a heightened scrutiny on those products and to be careful,\" said Dr. Jeremy Faust.\nThe Food and Drug Administration says pasteurized milk is safe because the heat treatment kills the virus.\nJust this week, the United States Department of Agriculture started testing raw milk in 13 states to help detect and contain bird flu.",

    "text": "The legal actions are coming in fast with Jane’s Addiction.\nMembers of the influential alt-rock band on Wednesday sued their former lead singer, Perry Farrell, after a fight broke out between Farrell and guitarist Dave Navarro during a show in September, The Guardian reports.\nIn response, Farrell, 66, filed a legal complaint against the band, claiming he was the victim of the incident, Variety reports.\nAccording to Deadline, Navarro, 58, the band’s guitarist, bassist Eric Avery and drummer Stephen Perkins sued Farrell for $10 million Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Farrell of a “brutal and unprovoked” onstage attack on Navarro.\nThe lawsuit says the incident led to the canceling several tour dates and the loss of millions of dollars, Deadline reports.\nThe incident occurred during a Jane’s Addiction show in Boston. Reports say Farrell attacked Navarro as the song “Ocean” came to an end. Video reportedly shows Farrell intentionally shoulder-bumping Navarro, then yelling and pushing toward the guitarist. Navarro tried to hold him back, but Farrell threw a punch across Navarro’s chest.\nThe band’s crew members rush onto the stage and, along with bassist Eric Avery, restrain Farrell, who struggles with them before finally being escorted away.\nFarrell’s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said in a post on Instagram after the incident that “Clearly there had been a lot of tension and animosity between the members.”\n“Perry’s frustration had been mounting, night after night, he felt that the stage volume had been extremely loud and his voice was being drowned out by the band,” Etty Lau wrote. “Perry had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat every night. But when the audience in the first row started complaining up to Perry, cussing at him that the band was (playing) too loud and that they couldn’t hear him, Perry lost it.”\nDeadline reports Farrell’s legal motion accuses Navarro playing loudly during the concert in Chicago as part of “a longstanding pattern of harassment and bullying [Farrell] has suffered at the hands of the other members of the band, and the various passive aggressive, or sometimes just aggressive ‘tricks’ they would use to undermine his performances on stage.”\nThe motion accuses Navarro of attacking Farrell and his wife backstage following the show. Farrell also says he was given no say in ending the tour.\n“This is yet another clear example of the group uniting to isolate and bully frontman Perry Farrell,” a representative of Farrell said in a statement to People Magazine. “The timing of this baseless lawsuit is no coincidence — it was filed only after they caught wind of legal action coming from our side. It’s a transparent attempt to control the narrative and present themselves as the so-called ‘good guys’ — a move that’s both typical and predictable.\"",
