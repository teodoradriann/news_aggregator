    "title": "Chiang Rai's Rivers Threatened By Arsenic Contamination from Myanmar Gold Mines",
    "text": "CHIANG RAI – Authorities in Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand, are urgently investigating elevated levels of arsenic and other heavy metals detected in the Mae Kok, Sai, Ruak, and Mekong rivers.\nThis toxin, along with mercury, zinc, and other harmful metals, has been traced to gold mining operations upstream run by Chinese interests with support from the United Wa State Army (UWSA).\nThese pollutants have spread through the Kok and its main tributary, the Kham River, both of which feed into the Mekong. The result has been harm to public health, damage to local economies, and growing anxiety among fishers and farmers.\nThe Living River Siam Association , a group focused on protecting local rivers, has warned that this pollution threatens not just the environment but also the lives and well-being of millions across the Mekong Basin.\nSomkiat Khuanchiangsa , who leads the group, spoke at a recent Chiang Rai meeting, explaining, “The rivers are dying, and with them, people’s way of life. We’re finding contaminated fish, and now no one feels safe eating from these waters.”\nContamination Originates in Shan State The Kok and Kham rivers begin in Mong Hsat, a remote part of Myanmar’s Shan State near the Thai border. Once covered in thick forest and home to the Shan people, the area has seen huge changes over recent decades.\nThe UWSA, with backing from Myanmar’s military and Chinese investors, pushed out residents and invited Chinese companies to open large gold mines near these rivers. Mining activity picked up further in 2021, with five or six new mines opening in the Wa-controlled area since 2024.\nUnlike regulated mines, these operations follow few environmental rules. Workers use water to wash gold from the soil, which releases arsenic, a natural part of gold ore, into the rivers. Wastewater from these mines is dumped straight into the Kok and Sai rivers, turning the water cloudy and dangerous. Thai environmentalist Paskorn Jumlongrach recalled, “Last year, the Sai River turned milky white. If testing had started sooner, we might have caught the problem earlier.”\nRecent testing highlights just how bad things have become. In March 2025, Thailand’s Environmental and Pollution Control Office found arsenic in the Kok River at 0.026 mg/L in Chiang Mai’s Mae Ai district—over twice the World Health Organisation’s safe level of 0.01 mg/L. Mercury reached 0.076 mg/L, above the 0.05 mg/L safety limit.\nThe Sai River also showed high arsenic and zinc, with zinc levels 18 times what’s considered safe. Sediment samples at the Thai-Myanmar border revealed arsenic readings of 33 mg/kg, a level that threatens fish and other river life.\nFish Tainted, Markets Collapse The pollution has deeply affected fishing communities along the Kok and Kham rivers, which have long supported local families. Reports surfaced of tainted fish, including Asian redtail catfish found near the river mouths.\nThe Living River Siam Association, working with local agencies and universities, has been keeping track of river life. While initial checks suggested most green catfish were still healthy, finding polluted giant catfish set off alarm bells. Somkiat Khuanchiangsa stressed ongoing testing, noting the risk that heavy metals could build up in the food chain.\nLocal fish markets have suffered. “No one wants Kok River fish anymore,” said Jamrat Kampangkham of the Kok River Boat Operators’ Club. “Buyers hear about arsenic and leave.” Fishers in Chiang Saen, where the Kok joins the Mekong, have seen the same pattern.\nTests at the Golden Triangle—where the Ruak River meets the Mekong—showed arsenic levels at 0.19 mg/L, 19 times above the safe limit. This raises concerns about pollution spreading to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\nWith sales already battered by last year’s floods, which buried parts of Mae Sai and Tachileik in mud, the fear of toxic fish has only made things worse. Supin Kamjai, a 63-year-old fisher from Ban Huai Kum, said, “We used to supply restaurants and markets across Chiang Rai.\nNow, no one will take our catch.” Many also worry that crops irrigated with river water might contain toxins, putting food safety at risk.\nHealth Hazards and Uncertainty Arsenic is a known cancer risk, and long-term contact through water or food can cause skin problems, cancer, nerve damage, and slow development in children. Mercury from the mines poses similar dangers.\nIn Chiang Rai, some people have developed skin rashes, and many fear what might come next. Sai U, a farmer in Shan State near the mines, shared, “My cattle collapsed after drinking from a stream. If it’s killing animals, what’s it doing to us?”\nThe Chiang Rai provincial government has banned the use of water from the Kok and Sai rivers for drinking or farming, but enforcing the ban is hard. Many rural areas still depend on these rivers, and there are worries about whether tap water and crops are safe. Taweesak Maneewan, from the Mekong Rainbow Foundation, said, “People are scared, but they have no other options.”\nTourism, a key part of Chiang Rai’s economy, has also suffered. Long-tail boat operators at CR Pier say passenger numbers are way down, with over 30 boats sitting idle. The region’s well-known elephant camp has lost 80% of its visitors since reports of arsenic contamination. Thawat, a 56-year-old boat operator, said, “The river used to be our pride. Now it brings only trouble.”\nNeed for Regional Cooperation The heart of the problem is in Myanmar, where years of conflict and weak leadership have let mining go unchecked. The country’s junta relies on mining money but has little control over Shan State, leaving the UWSA to act on its own.\nChinese investors benefit from this situation and face no pressure to limit pollution. Penchom Saetang, director of the Ecological Restoration Foundation, explained, “Thailand can’t fix this by itself. We need talks with Myanmar and China, backed by solid evidence.”\nThai officials are stepping up. Chiang Rai Governor Charin Thongsuk has ordered more water and sediment tests, with plans to set up a heavy metal monitoring centre involving local universities.\nThe Royal Thai Army is building embankments along the Sai River to help control flooding, which spreads contaminated soil. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has spoken with Myanmar’s ambassador, but progress has been slow. Phasakorn Boonyalak, who leads Thailand’s disaster agency, noted, “Myanmar is working on embankments, but they’re not doing enough dredging.”\nLocal groups, including the Living River Siam Association, want a cross-border panel to address pollution. Somkiat Khuanchiangsa calls for monthly water testing and talks among Thailand, Myanmar, China, and ethnic groups like the Wa. “Pollution needs to be traced back to the source. The mines must take responsibility,” he said.\nMekong Basin Faces Uncertain Future This crisis shows how fragile the Mekong Basin is. About 1.2 million people in Thailand and millions more in neighbouring countries depend on these rivers. Without quick action, Chiang Rai could become one of Thailand’s most polluted places, facing long-term damage to its economy, public health, and environment.\nAssociate Professor Sathian Chantha of Chiang Rai Rajabhat University put it simply, “This isn’t just about the Kok or Kham. Every Mekong community downstream is at risk.”\nWith the rainy season coming, people worry that floods will carry even more toxins downstream. For now, Chiang Rai’s residents wait, unsure if they can trust the river that once meant life and prosperity. The Kok and Kham, once symbols of plenty, now stand as a warning: when environmental care is ignored in one place, it can harm a whole region.\nRelated News: Chiang Rai’s Growing Crisis: Toxic Rivers and Cross-Border Neglect",

    "text": "Adrián Foncillas\nPekín 15 NOV 2024 12:30 Actualizada 15 NOV 2024 13:31 Corea del Norte ha abrazado a los drones con la fe del converso. Tras décadas atareado en perfeccionar misiles y demás armamento de guerras convencionales ha anunciado que sus fábricas despacharán sin pausa esos pequeños artilugios voladores que se muestran tan útiles en Ucrania . Lo ha anunciado su líder, Kim Jong-un , tras atender a un ensayo militar resuelto con aparente éxito.\nLas imágenes de la KCNA, la agencia oficial norcoreana, muestran a Kim y sus oficiales paseando entre dos modelos diferentes de drones , pixelados para no darle pistas al enemigo. Otras fotografías muestran una berlina alemana y varios tanques despanzurrados. Los drones, detalla la agencia, \"golpearon con precisión los objetivos\" durante la prueba. Permiten ajustar la distancia del ataque y están diseñados para alcanzar al enemigo en tierra y mar.\nKim ha ordenado ya un sistema de producción en serie tan pronto sea posible. El viraje, aclara, supone la actualización de la teoría militar vigente en su país. Lo justifica el tercer eslabón de la dinastía en \"los éxitos que están logrando los drones en pequeños y grandes conflictos\". No sólo cuenta su acrisolada capacidad asesina: sus costes de producción son infinitesimales en comparación con los de un misil de largo alcance y no exigen ninguna tecnología compleja. Los drones, lanzados en oleadas para dificultar su neutralización, permiten causar daños enormes a enemigos bien armados.\nInminente cargamento Corea del Norte no había mostrado un especial interés en los drones hasta ahora. Esta es sólo la segunda prueba publicada en la prensa, tras la de agosto, y en sus desafíos periódicos a su vecino del sur sólo consta el envío de cinco unidades a la isla de Ganghwa dos años atrás. Pionyang lamenta con vehemencia que grupos de ultraderecha surcoreanos esparzan sobre su territorio propaganda cargada en drones lanzados desde la frontera. Ha respondido siempre con globos y esperado que los vientos hicieran el trabajo. Es un método con el encanto de lo artesanal que ahora podría afinar con el inminente cargamento de drones.\nNadie ha mencionado a Ucrania en la prensa nacional pero es el destino más probable de los artilugios voladores. Kim ya ha enviado millones de municiones y unos 10.000 hombres a Vladímir Putin desde que ambos firmaran en julio un acuerdo de defensa que incluye el auxilio mutuo si alguno de los países era atacado.\nEn Pionyang sellaron una alianza con consecuencias imprevisibles en la península coreana y que también inquieta a China . Kim calificó a Putin como el \"más querido amigo del pueblo coreano\" y le mostró su \"absoluto apoyo y solidaridad\" en la guerra en Ucrania . El segundo le agradeció que ese apoyo fuera \"constante e inquebrantable\". \"Me refiero a nuestra lucha contra la política hegemónica impuesta durante décadas, la política imperialista de Estados Unidos y sus satélites contra la Federación Rusa\", añadió.\nEn combate en Ucrania Washington y Kiev han desvelado que las tropas de élite norcoreanas enviadas semanas atrás a la frontera ya han entrado en combate. No serán decisivas para el signo de la guerra pero sí influirán en zonas concretas como la de Kursk , donde están acuarteladas. En ellos confía Putin para acelerar la liberación de ese territorio invadido por Ucrania. Supone la primera misión en el extranjero de tropas norcoreanas y sobre su función y relevancia sólo hay hipótesis.\nCorea del Norte ha regresado al desenfreno: amenazas semanales a Seúl, lanzamientos de misiles de largo alcance, ninguna esperanza de diálogo y un vínculo cada día más férreo con Moscú. Pionyang será el asunto más relevante cuando esta semana se reúnan en la cumbre del Asia-Pacífico el presidente surcoreano, Yoon Suk Yeol, el estadounidense, Joe Biden, y el primer ministro japonés, Shigeru Ishiba.\nTEMAS",

    "title": "Eco-Friendly Waste Disposal Solutions for a Greener Future",
    "text": "Most aspects of people’s lives have recently become environmentally friendly due to solutions for daily problems that are environmentally friendly, especially in the area of waste disposal. Environmentally friendly waste disposal is meant to solve problems such as emitting greenhouse gases at very unsafe levels, climatic changes, and many more. These policies help build and create a sustainable future.\nThey have played an important role in shaping this future. Those who are curious about environmentally friendly ways to dispose of garbage can read this article. Choose local skips for hire right now because you want to breathe In a toxic environment. They can help you with that, so just make sure to help yourself and your neighbours.\nWhat Are Recycling And Waste Disposal? Recycling and waste disposal are the two important functions imperative to environmental sustainability. Waste is a process that collects waste, transports it, processes, and finally disposes of it. Waste disposal encompasses all recycling, reuse, and reduction. This calls for appropriate waste disposal from processing to disposal. Recycling is the conversion of waste into useful products. This minimises the amount of waste ending up in landfills.\nEnergy Conversion from Waste Disposal: Waste-to-energy is one of the most promising approaches to sustainably manipulating waste. Organic waste can be converted into biogas or power through processes which include anaerobic fermentation and incineration, lowering the want for fossil fuels and their terrible impact on the environment.\nCutting-Edge Recycling Technologies: Technology advancements in recycling are completely changing how we handle waste. These innovations improve the effectiveness of recycling processes, guaranteeing a better rate of component recovery and reducing the need for merchandise removal. Examples of these innovations include robotic separating technologies and the recycling of chemicals.\nIdeas For Sustainable Living: Reducing one’s environmental effect is the goal of a wide variety of behaviours that make up sustainable dwelling. Choosing reusable things over disposable matters, recycling, composting, and leading a lifestyle that minimises waste are crucial concepts. Another factor is environmentally pleasant furniture, which also discourages the tree cutting trend. And emphasises resilience and regional workmanship and is constructed from recycled or renewable substances. Appliances that eat an awful lot less power are a number one detail in reducing strength use, and buying used items is a greener option than buying new, reducing waste and the need for brand-spanking new sources. Composting: Organic wastes include materials like food waste and grass clippings. They may be used in creating compost that is nutrient-rich. Composting decreases landfills from which wastes are taken as it also produces the best amendment to the soil by reducing the need for chemical fertilisers.\nTo start composting at home, everything you want is a compost bucket or pile, a few organic substances, and a little bit of persistence. Your compost will develop into a valuable aid to your vegetation or garden given sufficient time and the perfect circumstances.\nUtilising Waste-To-Energy: The process of converting solid waste into heat or electricity is called waste energy. This includes various materials such as paper, paper, food waste, grass clippings, leaves, wood and leather goods, biogenic materials (of plant or animal origin) non-biogenic combustible materials such as metals and in addition to glass, it also includes plastics and other non-combustible materials.\nZero Waste: Zero Waste is an integrated approach to waste administration that minimises waste production and maximises resource recovery through system and process redesign. The goal is to eradicate waste. A closed-loop system with little waste, and product reuse, recycling, or composting is the aim.\nThe two significant primary objectives of zero-waste strategies are to reduce waste output, reuse goods and material, and to compost or recycle all leftover garbage. Its importance lies in the development of products and its use of such manufacturing techniques that minimise waste and encourage the use of sustainable resources.\nRepurposing: Though it is comparable to recycling, upcycling is distinct. It examines repurposing waste materials to give them an almost “better” life. It’s well-liked by artists and anyone who wants to turn rubbish into something useful.\nUpcycling’s upscaling qualities make it a successful environmentally friendly disposal technique. Waste is portrayed as having potential during the process of transformation to be something more useful rather than being a commodity that needs to be tossed away.\nOne well-liked e-waste disposal strategy is upcycling. Valuable resources are frequently thrown away before they reach their full potential. Resources from the earth as well as valuable waste materials are frequently found in electronic waste. These can be repurposed to create a useful product.\nFinal Words – Waste Disposal Solutions: New technology is emerging to assist solve the waste disposal problem as humans realise they want sustainable solutions. Pyrolysis is a system that produces gases that can be used as gas or transformed into different merchandise by way of heating waste merchandise without oxygen.",

    "text": "di Pierluigi Fagan. La società demo-liberista tende a deviare la rabbia e lo scontento su tutto ciò che è per lei innocuo ed anzi, proficuo. Ecco allora l’ampio e coinvolgente gioco di società delle guerre culturali. Ve ne sono diverse versioni per diversi gusti e profili socio-psico-culturali. Uno scenario che va molto è quello conservatori vs progressisti. Si tratta di due varianze dello spettro liberale classico, dai tempi dei tories e whigs inglesi del XVII secolo o repubblicani vs democratici americani. L’impianto della società è comune e ben accetto, si tratta solo di interpretarlo in chiave culturale più tradizionale o innovativa. Un altro scenario è quello dei generi sessuali e dei sessi. Qui la varianza è su due livelli: c’è quello sessuale maschi vs femmine (o viceversa) o c’è quello dell’interpretazione sessuale arrivato ormai ad acronimo da codice fiscale: LGBTQIA2S ovvero Lesbiche, Gay, Bisessuali, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual e Two-Spirit. Ma credo ne esistano anche versioni più complesse, basta andare su un sito porno che sono lo shopping mall (ipermercato) del settore. Ancora un altro scenario vede i maggioritari indigeni contro vari tipi di minoranze etniche, con una variante anche rispetto alle credenze religiose. C’è anche quello anagrafico sebbene sia poco frequentato, quello tra anziani e giovani. S’è un po’ rivitalizzato durante il Covid con gli anziani più preoccupati della possibile infezione e sue conseguenze che imponevano come standard generale restrizioni delle sacre libertà giovanili, immuni o più resilienti verso il virus o convinti di esser tali. Riguardo il contesto generale, troviamo la guerra climatico-ambientale e quella dell’opinione sulle guerre reali. La guerra culturale sull’ambiente è oscurata da quella specifica sul clima: il clima sta cambiando? Sì, no? Perché, cosa o chi ne è la causa? L’importante è fare finta di occuparsi della realtà e soprattutto ridurre la complessità del tema eco-logico a slogan ed obiettivi deviati ed innocui per un modo economico la cui natura entropica è autoevidente dato il Secondo principio della termodinamica. Quanto alle guerre di opinioni sulle guerre reali, abbiamo avuto due grandi festival in sequenza, quello ucraino-russo e quello israelo-palestinese. Sul primo, filo-americani, filo-russi, filo-pacifisti a priori o a posteriori, si sono dati sanguinosa battaglia per qualche mese, poi il filone della passione combattente si è esaurito. La guerra in quanto tale è andata avanti e soprattutto è andata sempre peggio per i filo-ucraini che non avevano mai sentito parlare di Ucraina e forse neanche sapevano dove trovarla sulla cartina. Poiché le guerre culturali sono mosse da posizioni morali effimere, l’attenzione si consuma presto, se poi il corrispondente concreto va anche male, meglio dimenticarle. Anche per non fare i conti di responsabilità con la tonnellata di stupidaggini che si sono dette, anche urlando con rabbia ed arrivando ad un niente dal voler mettere le mani addosso all’avversario d’opinione. Il secondo festival è esploso in una baraonda di opinioni etno-religiose con nazisti, antisemiti, Shoa, minaccioso islam armato, grandi satana, civiltà vs barbarie et varia. A soli sessanta giorni dall’inizio del festival abbiamo: 1200 morti e 5000 feriti israeliani, 16.000 morti e 45.000 feriti stimati tra i palestinesi. Come inascoltati sostenevano all’inizio della tempesta, è oramai certo che -ovviamente- i vertici di Israele sapevano in anticipo dell’azione di Hamas&Co. È altrettanto chiaro come inascoltati sostenevano sin dall’inizio che il problema per Israele non era affatto Hamas, ma i palestinesi in quanto tali, quelli di Gaza in particolare. Forse le due cose sono collegate (far finta di non sapere nulla così da avere la scusa per perseguire il secondo scopo), ma fare abduzioni è complottismo. Così i 2,3 milioni di abitanti della striscia prima sono stati spinti verso sud, ora vengono attaccati proprio lì dove li si è concentrati così da fargli capire che semplicemente, se ne debbono andare. Dove, non è un problema di Tel Aviv. L’opinione morale filo-palestinese ha esaurito impeto per impotenza, lo scandalo è palese, sotto gli occhi di tutti, nessuno fa niente, per salvarsi dalla frustrazione da impotenza meglio volgere lo sguardo da altra parte. A sua volta, l’opinione morale filo-israeliana ha tolto lo sguardo perché vabbè, una reazione anche forte si capisce e si giustifica, una vera e propria guerra etnica magari no. Entrambi gli schieramenti però possono cambiare scenario ed entrare in uno di quelli descritti sopra. Come nel ponte ologrammi di Star Trek, gli scenari sono infiniti. Intendiamoci, non è che il sottostante di queste guerre culturali sia inesistente, esiste. Tuttavia, non è affatto detto che sia correttamente rappresentato negli stereotipi culturali degli schieramenti d’opinione. Uno dei grandi vantaggi di queste guerre culturali è proprio sublimare le contraddizioni reali in un mondo di rappresentazione nette da offrire allo sdegno morale, suggerendo esiti deviati. Ad esempio, non domandarsi che mondo sarebbe se la metà del Cielo avesse avuto ed avesse davvero la possibilità di esprimere il suo specifico (che è di origine bio-psichico evidente), ma offrirgli l’opportunità di diventare generale di corpo d’armata come fanno i maschi. O domandarsi cosa mai ce ne dovrebbe fregare di come si innamorano o si eccitano o fanno sesso gli umani e perché mai qualcuno di tipo A dovrebbe esser meglio al tipo B. O porsi davvero il problema di come convivere con complessi culturali diversi, né esagerando, né minimizzando il problema. O definire meglio cosa significa “convivere”, se accettiamo l’Altro o si può evitare “aiutandolo a casa sua” e nel caso, come. O magari scoprire che non sarebbe male importarne qualcuno visto che siamo in profondo inverno demografico che ci porterà a contare 10 milioni di connazionali in meno tra trenta anni. Ma “qualcuno” chi e come? O domandarci come mai un problema continentale non viene trattato a livello europeo. O riflettere su quale è lo stato dell’assistenza sanitaria in Italia, la disponibilità ospedaliera, il rapporto tra pubblico e privato, gli occupati, la medicina di prossimità e la condizione ed organizzazione delle case per anziani quali siamo sempre di più (dove abbiamo primati mondiali). O non ridurre la questione ecologica e climatica ad automobili elettriche che poi abbiamo anche scoperto che non sappiamo o possiamo produrre per via dello sbilancio tra costi di produzione e costi di acquisto, nonché scoprire che hanno bisogno di materie prime cinesi che però è il nostro nuovo grande nemico nello scontro tra democrazie ed autocrazie. Quest’ultimo scontro foriero di altra guerra culturale che ha la stessa forma imposta al dibatto sessuale. Cosa mai ce ne dovrebbe fregare, ad esempio a noi europei, se i cinesi vivono in un paese dalla forma imperiale che però si definisce “comunista”? Perché potrebbero invadere Taiwan? Ma chi l’ha detto? Intanto Taiwan va ad elezioni presidenziali tra un mese e nei sondaggi il partito relativamente più filo-cinese è in testa sebbene di poco, quello più filo-americano o anti-cinese recupera ma siamo lì, un terzo che sulla questione è equidistante e si dedica più a questioni interne potrebbe fare da terzo incluso poggiandosi un po’ di qua o un po’ di là. La Cina dichiarò che la provincia ribelle doveva esse reintegrata entro il 2049, non c’è alcuna fretta ovvero non c’è alcuna attualità. Così per le ragioni concrete sottostanti il conflitto ucraino che ci è costato non poco sotto molti punti di vista, pare inutilmente visto lo scontato esito e sul quale dovevano semmai domandarci perché non abbiamo fatto nulla per impedire che accadesse. Che poi vale anche per l’annosa questione israelo-palestinese. Salvo domandarci magari perché ci eccitiamo per l’autonomia dei taiwanesi e non di quella dei palestinesi che sono lì ad un tiro di schioppo. O che fine ha fatto l’eccitazione per questione curda? O magari domandarci perché non c’è una questione armena nel Nagorno-Karabakh oggetto di pulizia etnica in corso ad opera degli azeri che poi sono i principali acquirenti di armi israeliane e base per tutte i nefandi commerci d’armi a base NATO, come ormai noto da tempo. Il concetto di guerra culturale si deve ad un sociologo americano, non tutti gli americani hanno perso la ragione. Lo presentò in un libro del 1991 come lettura della struttura culturale a forte base morale riconducibile al mondo delle credenze spirituali. «Le visioni progressiste e ortodosse sono principalmente sistemi di comprensione morale. Identifica l’ortodossia come un punto di vista attraverso il quale la verità morale è statica, universale e sanzionata attraverso poteri divini; in contrasto al progressismo, che vede la verità morale come in evoluzione e contestuale. Questi due gruppi sono bloccati in un’eterna “guerra culturale” per affermare il dominio sulle varie entità istituzionali e sistemiche influenzate dalla prassi culturale contemporanea, in particolare i rami governativi dell’America.». Si tratta, in sostanza, di un gioco sociale con valenze politiche tipicamente americano che noi abbiamo importato o ci è stato imposto a seguire Halloween, il Black Friday, l’NBA e Taylor Swift. Nel catalogo delle guerre culturali manca quella tra i tanti sempre meno ricchi ed i pochi sempre più ricchi, quella è vietata, davvero amorale, scandalosa, abbietta. Poiché fine di ogni gioco è intrattenere e divertire, si dice che l’importante non è vincere ma partecipare. Ma credo che dovremmo invece domandarci se partecipare o meno. Questi giochi di importazioni a volte attecchiscono a volte no, ci fu anche la sfuriata delle sale Bingo poi diventate deserti spettrali e patetici per mancanza di allocchi. Forse prima di imbracciare la tastiera per urlare al mondo il nostro sdegno o la nostra accorata passione per l’opinione A o B, dovremo domandarci perché ci vogliono intrattenere e far divertire quando ci sono tante cose nel mondo concreto intorno a noi che non vanno affatto bene. Astenersi, a volte, è meglio che partecipare. Non cambia nulla lo stesso, ma almeno si salva la dignità di non contribuire a tenere in piedi queste macchine del nonsenso in cerca di consenso per fini non nostri.
