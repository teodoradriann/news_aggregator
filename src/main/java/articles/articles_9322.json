    "title": "Drought: Morocco mobile desalination units quench remote areas’ thirst",
    "text": "BEDDOUZA (Morocco), Oct 4 (NNN-AGENCIES) — In the small fishing village of Beddouza in western Morocco, locals have turned to the Atlantic to quench their thirst, using mobile desalination stations to combat the kingdom’s persistent drought.\nSince 2023, Morocco has built some 44 of these desalination stations, also called “monobloc” — compact, transportable units that have come as a boon against the increasingly tangible effects of climate change.\nThe potable water is distributed with tanker trucks to remote areas in the country, currently grappling with its worst drought in nearly 40 years.\n“We heard about desalinated water in other villages, but we never expected to have it here,” said Karim, a 27-year-old fisherman who did not give his last name, gathered among dozens with jerrycans to collect his share of water.\nHassan Kheir, 74, another villager, described the mobile stations as a godsend, as groundwater in the region “has dried up”.\nSome 45,000 people now have access to drinking water directly from the ocean in Beddouza, about 180 kilometres northwest of Marrakesh, as a result of three monobloc desalination stations.\nThese units can potentially cover a radius of up to 180 kilometres, according to Yassine Maliari, an official in charge of local water distribution.\nWith nearly depleted dams and bone-dry water tables, some three million people in rural Morocco urgently need drinking water, according to official figures, and the kingdom has promised to build 219 more desalination stations.\nMonobloc stations can produce up to 3,600 cubic metres of drinking water per day and are “the best possible solution” given the ease of distributing them, said Maliari.\nFor cities with greater needs, like Casablanca, larger desalination plants are also under construction, adding to 12 existing national plants with a total capacity of nearly 180 million cubic metres of drinking water per year.\nBy 2040, Morocco is poised to face “extremely high” water stress, a dire prediction from the World Resources Institute, a non-profit research organisation.\nWith coasts on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the North African country has banked on desalination for water security.\nIn Beddouza, the population is relatively better off than those in remote areas further inland.\nAbout 200 kilometres east, in Al-Massira, the country’s second-largest dam has nearly dried up.\nThe dam has filled up to an alarmingly meagre 0.4 percent, compared to 75 percent in 2017, Abdelghani Ait Bahssou, a desalination plant manager in the coastal city of Safi, said.\nThe country’s overall dam fill rates currently average 28 percent but are feared to shrink by 2050 as drought is expected to persist, according to the agriculture ministry.\nOver that same period, official figures project an 11-percent drop in rainfall and a rise in temperatures of 1.3 degrees Celsius.\nAs the country grapples with the increasingly volatile effects of climate change, King Mohammed VI has pledged that desalination will provide more than 1.7 billion cubic metres per year and cover more than half of the country’s drinking water needs by 2030.\nThe lack of water also threatens Morocco’s vital agriculture sector, which employs around a third of the working-age population and accounts for 14 percent of exports.\nCultivated areas across the kingdom are expected to shrink to 2.5 million hectares in 2024 compared with 3.7 million last year, according to official figures.\nIn 2023, 25 percent of desalinated water was alloted to agriculture, which consumes more than 80 percent of the country’s water resources.\nAgainst this backdrop, authorities in Safi were in a “race against time” to build a regular desalination plant which now serves all of its 400,000 residents, said Bahssou.\nThe plant is set to be expanded to also provide water by 2026 for Marrakesh and its 1.4 million residents, some 150 kilometres east of Safi, Bahssou added. — NNN-AGENCIES",

A nomeação foi feita pelo secretário Guilherme Schleder, com o aval do prefeito Eduardo Paes.\nEm entrevista, Arar adiantou as prioridades de sua gestão. “Essa subsecretaria é voltada para o mundo das lutas, para as atividades físicas e para o bem-estar da população de um modo geral”, afirmou.\nEntre os projetos destacados está a continuidade do ensino de artes marciais para os estudantes das escolas municipais e a revitalização da Calçada da Fama, equipamento criado por ele durante seu mandato como vereador. “Além de preservar a história e a cultura da luta, pode se tornar um grande ponto turístico”, disse.\nNa área de atividades físicas, o foco será o fortalecimento das academias públicas de musculação e a promoção de exercícios ao ar livre, aproveitando programas já existentes na cidade.\nA subsecretaria também pretende atuar na capacitação profissional no setor esportivo e incluir a ioga como ferramenta de saúde mental. “Vamos aumentar o conhecimento de todos aqueles ligados ao esporte e preparar milhares de cariocas para o mercado de trabalho, gerando bem-estar social”, declarou Arar.\nO ex-vereador expressou entusiasmo com o novo desafio. “Depois de quatro mandatos como vereador, estou empolgado com essa oportunidade de estar do outro lado do balcão, no poder executivo. Vontade de fazer pelo carioca não me falta”, concluiu, em tom descontraído.\nAinda de acordo com Arar, a pasta sob seu comando terá como meta aliar esporte, qualidade de vida e inclusão social, dando continuidade a projetos que ele defendia em sua atuação parlamentar.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbians basked in a balmy December that was warm enough for five communities to set or equal temperature records for the month. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor says the mean temperature at Vancouver International Airport last month was 7 degrees Celsius, tying with 1939 as the city's warmest December on record. The mean temperature was 3.4 degrees higher than what is considered normal for the month. Proctor says warm weather records for December were also either set or tied in Victoria, Comox, Campbell River and Abbotsford. The month was also very dry and Proctor says there wasn't enough rain or snow to alleviate long-standing drought concerns in the province. He says the first full week of January is expected to get cooler with some snow possible at higher elevations This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2024. The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said December wasn't warm enough to break records in British Columbia. In fact, Environment Canada now says multiple communities either broke or tied heat records.",
