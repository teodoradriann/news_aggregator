    "text": "Chennai Couple Spends Rs 70,000 A Month To Raise Baby. Here’s How Much They Save\nThe couple, who earn ₹78,000 per month, spend ₹46,500 on rent and daycare alone.\nManaging finances while raising a child can be incredibly challenging, especially with a limited income and no additional support. A Chennai-based couple recently shared how they navigate their monthly expenses while caring for their 8.5-month-old baby on a combined income of ₹78,000. They revealed that they made a conscious decision to rent a safe home located close to a reputable daycare for their daughter.\nAs a result, they spend ₹46,500 each month on rent and daycare alone. Despite the steep cost, the couple believes these essentials are non-negotiable when it comes to their child’s safety and well-being.\nRecommended Stories\nIn a now-deleted Reddit post, the couple said, “We are a couple living in Chennai with a combined monthly income of Rs 78,000 (after tax). We have an 8.5-month-old baby, and we’ve chosen a good daycare and a safe rental house very close to it. We chose them with utmost care because our baby is very small and we want to ensure safety, cleanliness, and proximity.\"\nAfter spending most of their monthly income on rent and daycare, they then use around Rs 10,000 for food, including groceries, fruits, vegetables and milk. They spend Rs 8,500 on travel, which includes auto rides, metro and petrol. Baby diapers cost them another Rs 3,000. For electricity and gas, they pay Rs 1,000 each. All these regular expenses cost Rs 70,000 every month. This leaves them with just Rs 8,000 at the end, which they try to keep aside for savings or any emergency.\nThe couple shared that they don’t get any help from their families as they got married without their approval. Now, the wife is trying to find part-time or online work that she can do from home. She only has one free hour each day, so she is looking for something that fits into that time frame.\nIn another such example, Meenal Goel, a startup founder from Bengaluru, spoke about how expensive it has become to raise a child in Indian cities. She said that the total cost of raising a child in today’s time can go up to Rs 45 lakh. Meenal pointed out that many parents are finding it hard to handle added expenses, especially in metro cities where everything, from school fees to basic daily needs, costs more than before.\nAbout the Author\nBuzz Staff\nvideos, and memes, covering quirky incidents, social media\nbuzzfrom\nindiaand around the world, Also Download the\nNews18 Appto stay updated!\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nTerms of Useand\nPrivacy Policy.",

Unas elecciones no son una cuestión de fe. Papelitos hablan. La oposición hizo públicas las actas que obtuvieron sus representantes al final de cada votación del 80% de las mesas.\nMaduro y la CNE tienen las actas del 100% de las mesas, porque igual tenían sus representantes que las recibieron al final de cada votación del colegio.\nTodo parece indicar que las actas de González son auténticas. Porque si no lo fueran Maduro mostraría las suyas. Pero ni una sola ha mostrado que difiera de la de la oposición.\nBueno si. Fueron a mostrar una a la TV que difería de las publicadas. Y resultó que olvidaron falsear el QR, el cuál tiene codificados los resultados que coincidían con los publicados por la oposición jajaja\n[#25](c25#c-25) Las otras veces el pucherazo no sería tan descarado y torpe. Ahora todo el mundo sabe que Maduro es un fraude porque no puede demostrar con hechos creíbles que ha ganado.

Simplemente lo reafirman una y otra vez.

    "title": "US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as monopoly penalty",
    "text": "The US justice department and a group of states asked a federal court late Wednesday to force Google to sell Chrome, its web browser, a move that could fundamentally alter the $2 trillion company's business and reshape competition on the internet. The request follows a landmark ruling in Aug by Judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia that found Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search. Judge Mehta asked the justice department and the states that brought the antitrust case to submit solutions by the end of Wednesday to correct the search monopoly.Beyond the sale of Chrome, the govt asked Judge Mehta to give Google a choice: either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or bar Google from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the govt could force the company to sell Android at a later date.The govt also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on phones and in browsers. Google should also be required to allow rival search engines to display the company's results and access its data for a decade, the govt said. The proposals are the most significant remedies requested in a tech antitrust case since the justice department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000. If Judge Mehta adopts the proposals, they will set the tone for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths, including Apple, Amazon and Meta.Being forced to sell Chrome and Android would be among the worst possible outcomes for Google. Chrome, which was introduced in 2008 and is free to use, is the most popular web browser in the world, with an estimated 67% of the global browser market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Android is the world's most popular mobile software, with an estimated 71% of the market, according to Statcounter. The system is open-source, meaning that Samsung and other phone manufacturers do not have to pay Google for its use. But most Android devices come with Google's apps already installed.Google is set to file its own suggestions for fixing the search monopoly by Dec 20. Both sides can modify their requests before Judge Mehta is expected to hear arguments on the remedies this spring. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, called the govt's proposal \\\"extreme.\\\" \\\"DOJ's wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court's decision,\\\" he said. \\\"It would break a range of Google products - even beyond Search - people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\\\"",

    "text": "By Cian O’Connell Clubs from all four provinces participated in St Mary's Inaugural U11 Festival of Hurling. The event held last Saturday in Carnaun featured St Joseph’s Doora-Barefield (Clare), Monaleen, Na Piarsaigh (Limerick), James Stephens, St Patrick’s/Fenians (Kilkenny), Naas (Kildare), and Dungannon Eoghan Ruadh (Tyrone). Organised with Go Games rules the matches centred on enjoyment with St Mary's, Athenry juvenile chairperson Leonard Fay highlighting the contribution of those who made the day a real success. “Everything went well logistically, a lot of work and preparation went into it by a lot of volunteers,” Fay says. “With teams from four provinces, it was nice to see it. “Eoghan Ruadh from Dungannon are a wonderful hurling team, I think they've got Féile in their mind, that is the standard they're at, to be fair. “As a club we probably didn't have the facilities in the past. We've done a lot of work with that, new pitches and the development in Carnaun. That affords us an opportunity to give invites back to these clubs. It is all about the kids, these are U11s.” The reaction in the club was very positive according to Fay. “Our senior hurling team were involved, helping out, our minor hurling team helped out,” he adds. “They met all of these young kids, we were all 11 once, you look up to these older hurlers. You aspire to be them, it was brilliant the way it all worked out.” Damien Sheridan, part of the organising committee, who is also Games Manager for Longford GAA, was delighted how it unfolded. “There was a lot of trepidation at the outset leading into it, the first time doing something, we wanted to do a good job,” Sheridan says. “We had a lot of good people involved, pretty much no stone left unturned. The teams that came, the clubs were unanimous really with the positive compliments flying around on Saturday when mentors were heading home, messaging on buses. “Even the referees were messaging to say it was a really well ran event, lots of really good stuff like that. Everybody involved was delighted on Saturday night, it set the benchmark for going forward and running successful events every year.” The connection between the past, present, and future of Athenry mattered deeply. “We had one piper, he led the parade before the games,” Sheridan explains. “We had a minute silence for past members of the club and Ámhran Na bhFiann. We had one piper, five pitches, seven official referees - that was a big thing we wanted, we had breaks built into their days so they wouldn't be fatigued. “We had eight clubs from four provinces, 20 teams between the eight clubs with 40 matches, and almost 100 volunteers. “That was from the committee to the parents, who made food boxes for the kids, to the parking stewards, and minor players, who did umpires and line officials at every pitch.” Ultimately, hurling and fun were on the agenda. “We tried to make sure every base was covered for the 260 kids, it was one great event, and no trophies,” Sheridan says. “Nobody needed to have a trophy, it was just good hurling with a lot of respect and goodwill. People just enjoyed the game of hurling.” That is what it was all about.",

    "title": "Texas Heat Index Rising Faster Than Temperature, Study Finds",
    "text": "A new study of summer weather in Texas finds the heat index — an indicator of how hot it feels outside — is rising much faster than the temperature.\nThe reason, scientists say, is that warming is leading to a rise in humidity. Historically in Texas, the relative humidity would fall when the temperature rose, making it possible to cool off by sweating. But now Texas is seeing high heat and high humidity together. On hot, muggy days, the air is so saturated with water that sweat sticks to the skin rather than evaporating. As a result, the weather feels much warmer than a thermometer alone would suggest.\nIn 1979, physicist Robert Steadman developed the heat index to indicate how such weather actually feels. But Steadman did not calculate the index for the high levels of heat and humidity routinely seen today. In 2022, scientists at UC Berkeley\nrecalculated the heat index to account for more extreme weather. And in 2023, Berkeley physicist David Romps applied the updated heat index to the summer heat in Texas.\nHe found that while Texas has warmed by around 3 degrees F (1.5 degrees C) on average since the preindustrial era, on some scorching summer days last year it felt up to 11 degrees F (6 degrees C) hotter than it would have without climate change. His\nstudy was published in Environmental Research Letters.\nRomps wrote that, compared to the temperature, the heat index offers “a more accurate picture of the extent to which global warming has increased heat stress.”\nALSO ON YALE E360\nNations Are Undercounting Emissions, Putting UN Goals at Risk",
