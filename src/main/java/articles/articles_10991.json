    "title": "La inflación interanual oficial en Cuba se ubicó en el 30,48 % en julio",
    "text": "La Habana, 15 ago (EFE).- La inflación interanual del mercado formal de Cuba se situó en julio en el 30,48 %, prácticamente la misma tasa del mes anterior, según informó este jueves la Oficina Nacional de Estadística e Información (ONEI). La variación del índice de precios al consumo (IPC) con respecto a junio fue del 0,83 % y la acumulada en lo que va de año se sitúa en el 18,78 %. El mayor incremento interanual por categorías fue en Bebidas alcohólicas y tabaco (50,48 %), seguido por Restaurantes y hoteles (36,71 %), Alimentos y bebidas no alcohólicas (35,17 %) y Transporte (32,58 %). Como sucede habitualmente en los reportes mensuales sobre la inflación, prácticamente todos los rubros experimentaron subidas interanuales por encima del 10 %. Solo hubo tres excepciones: Recreación y Cultura (9,32 %), Comunicaciones (0,75) y Salud (0,72 %). En los dos últimos casos se trata de monopolios estatales. Por tercer mes consecutivo, algo que no había sucedido hasta entonces, en el informe se subraya que las cifras incluyen al sector privado, aún minoritario pero con un claro auge desde la legalización de las pymes en 2021. La institución afirmó que el 80,41 % de los 8.176 establecimientos en los que se levantó la muestra pertenecen al sector privado, cuando el grueso de comercio minorista en el país están aún en manos de empresas estatales. Cuba se encuentra sumida en una grave crisis económica desde hace cuatro años, evidente en la escasez de básicos (alimentos, medicinas y combustible), la inflación galopante, la dolarización parcial de la economía y los frecuentes apagones. La combinación de la pandemia de la covid-19, el endurecimiento de las sanciones estadounidenses bajo la Administración de Donald Trump (2017-2021) y los errores en políticas económicas y monetarias han agravado problemas estructurales de la economía cubana. La situación ha provocado desesperanza y un gran descontento social, visible en varias inusuales protestas y en una oleada migratoria sin precedentes por su escala y duración. (c) Agencia EFE",

    "title": "Welcome to Samdal-ri Season 1 Episodes 11 & 12 Recap",
    "text": "Summary Episode 11 and 12 are Welcome to Samdal-ri as its best thus far, expanding on multiple personal subplots and delivering many emotions. Episodes 11 and 12 of Welcome to Samdal-ri welcomely expand focus, taking in more of Jeju Island’s inhabitants without losing sight of the leads, while also delivering a rollercoaster of emotions. Episode 12, in particular, is one of the strongest single installments of Season 1. Table of Contents Welcome to Samdal-ri Season 1 Episode 11 Recap First, the theme park. This subplot has a wider scope than just Yong-pil and Sam-dal, so it’s indicative of how the episodes are branching out and covering more bases. In essence, Dae-young’s decision to move the park from Namdal-ri to Samdal-ri goes down like a lead balloon, causing all kinds of issues for him with his former in-laws, though they are, to be fair, understandable. The parent company has a long history of interfering in the family’s lives and stifling opportunities, and the risk of having them return to Samdal-ri and continue that is high. And then there’s the sea pollution to consider. This does allow us more insight into Jin-dal and Dae-young’s marriage, though, and their relationships with each other’s respective families. Their separation and Dae-young just dropping off the map was painful for everyone, not just Dae-young and Jin-dal. Their attitudes were just incompatible. However, Dae-young actually shifted the location of the theme mark for the benefit of Mi-ja. With the park’s construction, diving would be banned, and the compensation would be significant. Dae-young had already paid Mi-ja’s hospital bill, so this was another gesture along those lines. Jin-dal tells him to go back to Namdal-ri, though. Following on from the end of [Episode 10](https://readysteadycut.com/2024/01/01/welcome-to-samdal-ri-season-1-episodes-9-10-recap/), Sam-dal literally flees from Yong-pil in embarrassment. She recalls everything that happened the night before, but Yong-pil isn’t willing to let the matter go. Of course, there’s also Sang-do to consider, and things to come to a bit of a head in that regard, with pointless bickering over who has done more for whom, all because two grown-ups are fighting over a crush. It’s easy to imagine some viewers being put off by all this, but there’s a certain charm to it nonetheless. How does Samdal-ri Season 1 Episode 11 end? Episode 11 ends by really interrogating the likelihood of Sam-dal and Yong-pil being able to succeed as a couple given all the water that has passed under the bridge since the first time they tried. While waiting for a natural phenomenon that Sam-dal plans to photograph to occur, they consider who was to blame for their breakup, and how couples who have been together and then been apart tend to linger on the reasoning behind their separation. Yong-pil thinks they can overcome the difficulties they experienced the first time – primarily Sang-tae’s fury – and be okay. But can they? Welcome to Samdal-ri Season 1 Episode 12 Recap The subplot with Jin-dal and Dae-young continues in Episode 12. The former accompanies the latter to a meeting about the theme park and fields concerned questions that stump him. This protective dynamic seems to have been essential to their marriage in the past, but it was one-way traffic. Dae-young didn’t stand up for Jin-dal when it counted, leaving her to shoulder the burden of mistreatment and remain quiet about it to protect him. Welcome to Samdal-ri doesn’t strictly need a villain, but it does sort of have one in the form of the obsessive Eun-ju, who decides in this episode that she’s going to come to Samdal to take advantage of picturesque locations. Her own shoot was a failure, but this is, of course, just obsession, following attempts to reignite the scandal around Sam-dal. However, it isn’t easy for Sam-dal to respond since her reputation is on tenterhooks as it is. However, Eun-ju’s arrival in town is nonetheless met with extreme hospitality, and Sam-dal on her home turf seems as though she isn’t to be trifled with. The core question following on from the previous episode is, obviously about Sam-dal and Yong-pil’s relationship. Now official, more or less, but keeping it quiet, mostly out of fear of Sang-tae. Mi-ja supportively tries talking to him, but he’s having none of it. Luckily, Mi-ja has had quite enough of her daughter being mistreated, whether it’s by Eun-ju – Mi-ja makes that point very clearly – or Sang-tae. She resolves not to allow it to continue in any form any longer. How does Welcome to Samdal-ri Season 1 Episode 12 end? The episode ends, somewhat predictably, with Sang-tae learning of Yong-pil and Sam-dal being together again. In a rage, he marches over and confronts Sam-dal about why she returned after he begged her to break up with his son. However, he does this in front of Yong-pil, who apparently had no idea of these previous circumstances and is livid to discover them in this way. This week’s pair of episodes ends on this note of high drama. What did you think of Welcome to Samdal-ri Season 1 Episodes 11 and 12? Let us know in the comments.

    "title": "Judge Aileen Cannon Finds ‘Ridiculous’ Way to Delay Trump’s Case—Again",
    "text": "By Josh Fiallo ,\n1 hour ago Reuters/Marco Bello Judge Aileen Cannon has cooked up yet another way to slow-walk Donald Trump ’s classified documents case, handing the ex-president a partial win Thursday as his lawyers work overtime to delay his trial until after the election.\nCannon wrote in an 11-page order that she’d indulge Trump’s lawyers and hold more pre-trial hearings in which they can challenge evidence gathered against Trump in relation to his alleged pilfering of classified documents.\nThe Florida-based district judge, who was appointed by Trump after he lost the 2020 election but before he left office, wrote that “further factual development is warranted” regarding the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago, suggesting she may be receptive to claims from Trump’s lawyers that something is off about the case.\nIt’s a clear win for Trump’s team, who’ve fought tooth and nail to have each of his criminal trials be delayed and delayed again. It’s been nearly two years since FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago, allegedly uncovering more than 100 classified documents, including in a bathroom, a ballroom, and stashed under dirty golf clothes.\nSince that raid, Trump has contested that the search warrant was faulty, that agents had no authority to search his South Florida estate, and that investigators improperly breached attorney-client privilege.\nNow, Trump’s defense will be permitted to make those same arguments in front of Cannon in a hearing. Thursday’s ruling did not list a date for the additional hearings, which likely only adds to prosecutors’ frustration as the trial’s start date has been put on ice indefinitely.\nThursday’s decision came just days after Cannon concluded another three-day hearing over prosecutors’ gag order request and Trump’s challenge to the validity of special prosecutors—an issue that had already been ruled on by other courts in the past. She is yet to issue a ruling on either.\nCannon, who reportedly refused to recuse herself from the case despite entreaties from two more senior judges, has been repeatedly accused of doing Trump’s bidding.\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that Cannon is in over her head. “She’s delayed this case and ruled in Trump’s favor at almost every possible turn. She’s entertained arguments that no other judge would,” he said.\nJoyce Vance, a former U.S. prosecutor, shared similar thoughts in a post to X on Thursday.\n“The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing after a hearing on legal arguments?” he wrote. “Hard to see that as anything other than sheer delay. Ridiculous.”\nSteven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, unsurprisingly praised Cannon’s order in a statement on Thursday, saying she’s a “highly respected” judge and that Trump’s charges are a “political sham.”\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Ao Link Podcast, André abriu o jogo sobre o período em que foi preso por falta de pagamento de pensão alimentícia\nAtor relembra prisão por dívida de pensão alimentícia Em entrevista concedida ao Link Podcast, o ator André Gonçalves abriu o coração sobre a prisão por dívidas de pensão alimentícia com suas filhas, Manuela Seiblitz e Valentina Benini. O vice-campeão de A Fazenda 15, inclusive, admitiu o erro.\nO marido de Danielle Winits relembrou que chegou a dormir na cadeia. “Eu acabei pagando essa pena que me entristeceu bastante, eu fiquei preso, dormi uma noite na prisão, fiquei 60 dias em casa com a tornozeleira eletrônica, aquilo acabou um pouco comigo”, lamentou.\n“Eu tinha acabado de produzir um espetáculo e sempre com dinheiro do bolso, aquilo foi dando muito ruim para mim. Eu fui ficando triste, fui perdendo a esperança, cheguei a dizer publicamente que iria parar de trabalhar como ator já que não tinha condições de fornecer aquele valor”, prosseguiu.\nO artista ainda contou que sua condição financeira começou a mudar quando deixou a Globo, depois de 27 anos de casa. Com a chegada da pandemia, a situação piorou.\nAndré Gonçalves fala sobre convite para reality “Eu tive que mudar os pagamentos das pensões que eu tinha, a pandemia veio e isso degringolou de uma maneira muito forte. Teve um erro da minha parte e não dos meus filhos. Eu não consegui cumprir aquilo que era um direito deles”, explicou ele.\nEm final, André Gonçalves termina A Fazenda em segundo lugar. Reprodução: Record.\nAndré Gonçalves também disse que não hesitou em aceitar o convite para participar do reality rural. “Eu estava em um momento lascado, eu estava em um momento triste de alma, mas sem esperanças”, revelou.\n“Quando o convite de A Fazenda veio, eu não pensei duas vezes. Eu poderia abrir um leque na minha vida de possibilidades. Eu entrei triste, eu queria fazer qualquer coisa, em um determinado momento eu me entreguei ao reality”, finalizou.
