    "text": "28 Dec 2023 | 08:42 PM UTC Syria: Suspected Israeli airstrikes reported in Damascus area late Dec. 28 Syrian air defenses respond to suspected Israeli airstrikes in Damascus area late Dec. 28. Additional cross-border attacks possible. Syrian air defenses have reportedly activated in the vicinity of Damascus amid suspected Israeli airstrikes in the area late Dec. 28. While the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately issue a public acknowledgment of the suspected cross-border attack, alleged Israeli airstrikes have regularly targeted bases of Iran-affiliated groups, such as Hizballah, across Syria. Military forces in Syria and northern Israel will almost certainly maintain a heightened security posture over the coming days. Further airstrikes, retaliatory attacks, and exchanges of cross-border fire are possible over the short term. Exercise caution and avoid all military sites in Syria. Heed the instructions of local security forces. If airstrikes, artillery fire, or warning sirens are reported in the general vicinity, take cover in the nearest bomb shelter and remain there until given further instructions by authorities. Tensions between Syria and Israel remain extremely high. Israel has repeatedly expressed concerns about Iranian proxies in southwestern Syria and aims to prevent a major build-up of Iran-backed forces in the region. Since 2017, the IDF has launched hundreds of preemptive strikes in Syria, targeting suspected Hizballah and Iran-led fighters, weapons caches, and supply convoys, primarily in the country's southwestern governorates.",

    "text": "In his latest book,\n\"Magic Words,\" Wharton marketing professor Jonah Berger delves into how the specific words and grammar we use directly affect our persuasiveness.\nPulling from his latest research, titled\n\"How Verb Tense Changes Persuasion,\" published in January of this year with Grant Packard of York University and Reihane Boghrati of Arizona State University, he argues that making a change as small as choosing present tense verbs over past tense increases persuasiveness.\nBerger's research and other emerging studies in the field demonstrate why you should use the present tense if you wish to be more convincing.\nPresent tense conveys objectivity\nThe researchers conducted a total of eight studies to find that using present tense when giving your own opinions or experiences makes them seem truer.\nExperiences are subjective and a past tense really underlines that subjectivity, Berger said, whereas a present tense makes the experience seem more factual and universal. The present tense implies that the speaker's experience can be generalized, perhaps to the listener themselves, and makes you seem more certain and confident in the claims you are making.\nFor example, simply saying \"That restaurant is great\" persuades your audience to think highly of the restaurant more than saying \"that restaurant was great.\"\nMoney Report\nIt's also more vivid and immediate\nA similar\nstudy published in the latest volume of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology supports Berger's findings: University of Toronto researchers found that Amazon product reviews that were written in the present tense were viewed by others to be more helpful than those written in the past tense. They found the effect persisted beyond Amazon reviews, as well. Participants were 10% more likely to donate to a charity when the donation proposal was made in the present tense rather than in the past or future tense.\nThe study argues that the present seems more vivid to us than the past or the future, and this adds to your ability to convince, University of Toronto professor and co-author of the study Sam Maglio\ntold the University of Toronto Scarborough news.\nWriters, and increasingly fiction writers, have long used present tense as a method to increase impact and vividness for the readers. Using present tense to describe events is often employed to make the content of the story seem more immediate and intense, author David Jauss\nwrote in Writer's Digest back in 2014.\n\"We're all writers; we may not write books or novels or plays, but we're writing all the time,\" Berger told the \"\nKnowledge at Wharton\" podcast in October 2023. \"Every day we're writing emails, PowerPoint presentations, and Word documents in a variety of contexts.\"\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?\nSign up for our new newsletter!\nGet\nCNBC's free Warren Buffett Guide to Investing, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.",

    "text": "Neuropatía del nervio óptico: así es la enfermedad que sufre Laura Matamoros y que podría dejarla ciega\nEste artículo ha sido realizado y revisado para garantizar que la información sea lo más rigurosa posible y cumpla los estándares de calidad. Parte de estudios científicos que tienen su propio proceso de validación por parte de revistas especializadas en salud, fuentes confiables que son líderes de opinión de Sociedades Científicas, Colegios Profesionales, Universidades y Hospitales de prestigio, entre otros. La información que encontrará a continuación está acreditada en la bibliografía y en otras fuentes enlazadas en el texto.\n[Más información](#)\nLaura Matamoros fue diagnosticada en 2019 de una neuropatía del nervio óptico, igual que la enfermedad que sufe su padre y por la que podría perder la visión. Te contamos en qué consiste esta patología y qué síntomas deben hacernos sospechar.\nActualizado a: Viernes, 22 Noviembre, 2024 07:04:04 CETLa neuropatía del nervio óptico es una condición que afecta al nervio óptico, “fundamental para la transmisión de información visual desde la retina hasta el cerebro. Esta patología puede resultar en la pérdida de visión y se caracteriza por el daño o deterioro del nervio óptico debido a diversas causas, como isquemia (falta de flujo sanguíneo), inflamación, compresión por tumores, traumatismos o enfermedades autoinmunes”, explica en detalle [Andrés Fernández-Vega](https://fernandez-vega.com/equipo-medico/dr-andres-fernandez-vega-cueto-felgueroso/) Cueto-Felgueroso, especialista de la Unidad de Glaucoma del Instituto Oftalmológico Fernández-Vega.\nEsta enfermedad se produce por diferentes factores que pueden dañar o deteriorar el nervio óptico. Entre las causas más comunes se encuentran “la isquemia, una reducción en el flujo sanguíneo que priva al nervio de oxígeno y nutrientes; inflamaciones provocadas por enfermedades autoinmunes; compresión por tumores u otras masas que ejercen presión sobre el nervio; traumas físicos que dañan el nervio; y ciertas infecciones o intoxicaciones”.\nEn algunos casos, añade el experto, “condiciones como el glaucoma, asociado con un aumento de la presión intraocular, también pueden llevar al desarrollo de neuropatía óptica”.\nEsta presión elevada “puede causar una pérdida progresiva de las fibras nerviosas del nervio óptico, llevando a una disminución en el campo visual y, eventualmente, a la ceguera si no se trata adecuadamente”.\nQuiénes tienen más riesgo de sufrir una neuropatía\nEn cuanto a qué personas tienen más riesgo de sufrir este problema, Andrés Fernández-Vega Cueto-Felgueroso, “las personas con glaucoma tienen mayor riesgo de sufrir neuropatía del nervio óptico, ya que la presión intraocular elevada puede dañarlo”. Además, “personas con enfermedades cardiovasculares como hipertensión y diabetes, enfermedades autoinmunes y adultos mayores, también están en riesgo”. Por otro lado, añade, “el consumo de tabaco y alcohol también puede incrementar la probabilidad de padecer esta patología”.\nEl experto recuerda que esta condición no sólo afecta a personas mayores sino que también puede “presentarse en personas jóvenes, aunque las causas tienden a ser diferentes de las que se observan en adultos mayores”.\nEn este caso las más comunes son los “traumas oculares, que se refieren a lesiones físicas en los ojos o en la cabeza que pueden dañar el nervio óptico y un historial familiar de neuropatía óptica, infecciones que puedan inflamar el nervio óptico y el consumo de sustancias tóxicas o ciertos medicamentos, que puedan causar daño en esta zona”.\nSíntomas de una neuropatía del nervio óptico\nLos síntomas más comunes son:\n-\nVisión borrosa o nublada\n-\nDolor ocular,\n-\nPérdida de la percepción del color\n-\nReducción del campo visual o pérdida de visión, que puede ser súbita o progresiva.\nLa detección y el diagnóstico de este problema visual “se realiza a través de un examen de agudeza visual para determinar la claridad de la visión, pruebas de percepción del color y evaluación del nervio óptico”. Además, “se pueden usar técnicas como Tomografía de Coherencia Óptica (OCT), que proporciona imágenes detalladas de la retina y el nervio óptico; y pruebas de imagen como la resonancia magnética (RM) o la tomografía computarizada (TC). Además, se puede medir la presión intraocular si existen sospechas de glaucoma.\nCuál es el tratamiento\nEl tratamiento de la neuropatía del nervio óptico depende del origen. Por ejemplo, informa el experto, “si es causada por glaucoma, el tratamiento se enfoca en reducir la presión intraocular, generalmente mediante medicamentos, terapia láser o cirugía”.\nEn casos de “neuritis óptica asociada con enfermedades autoinmunes, se pueden utilizar corticosteroides para reducir la inflamación y acelerar la recuperación visual. Mientras que, en situaciones de neuropatía óptica tóxica, se debe identificar y eliminar la exposición a la toxina responsable”.\nDe igual forma, añade, “en todos los casos es necesario una detección temprana y pautar un tratamiento oportuno para minimizar el daño al nervio óptico y poder preservar la visión”.\n¿Se puede prevenir?\nLa prevención de esta neuropatía se enfoca principalmente en “controlar los factores de riesgo y tratar las diferentes condiciones que pueden contribuir a su desarrollo”, explica. Por ejemplo, “mantener un control estricto de enfermedades como la hipertensión y la diabetes es esencial para reducir el riesgo de daño al nervio óptico”. Asimismo, “las visitas periódicas al oftalmólogo pueden facilitar la detección temprana y permitir un tratamiento oportuno para evitar la progresión del daño”.\nSi bien no todas las causas de neuropatía óptica pueden prevenirse, “mantener un estilo de vida saludable y revisiones oftalmológicas regulares, son claves para reducir el riesgo y cuidar la salud ocular”.",
