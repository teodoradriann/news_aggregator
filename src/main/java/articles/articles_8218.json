    "title": "Significant Ukrainian Successes Against Russian Forces: NATO Admiral’s Assessment",
    "text": "2024-01-19 08:31:00\nKremlin troops “not effective” NATO admiral sees “significant Ukrainian successes”\nJan 19, 2024, 9:31 a.m. Listen to article\nThis audio version was artificially generated. More info | Send feedback\nThe failed summer offensive by the Ukrainian armed forces and the minimal advance of Russian troops give the impression that Moscow’s troops have the upper hand on the battlefield. However, NATO does not believe these successes have had a major impact.\nThe chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, assesses the current fighting in Ukraine as “fierce”. “Russia’s recent attacks are devastating, but not militarily effective,” Bauer said at a press conference after a meeting with Ukrainian Major General Salkutsan. “At the same time, we are seeing significant military successes on the Ukrainian side.”\nBauer assumes more than 300,000 Russian deaths and injuries. The Ukrainian troops also destroyed thousands of tanks and armored vehicles as well as hundreds of aircraft. “They were able to liberate significant parts of their territory and push the Russians back from around 50 percent of the areas occupied at the beginning of the war,” said Bauer.\nAnother advantage was that the Ukrainians were able to carry out “severe attacks to destroy important Russian capabilities.” “The fact that Ukraine, without a real navy, was able to push back the Russian Black Sea Fleet and open a grain corridor is another big win.”\nNATO: Negotiated solution through a strong Ukraine\nThe only way to a lasting negotiated solution is to strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield, Bauer said. The Kremlin, on the other hand, is said to be of the opinion, according to the Institute for War Studies (ISW), “that Russia can occupy more territory the longer the war lasts, and that the course of the war will increasingly weaken Ukraine’s negotiating position,” as it said in a statement Analysis is called.\nDespite the NATO admiral’s positive assessment of the course of the war for Ukraine, Kiev is also struggling with high casualties of soldiers and military equipment as well as exhausted troops. They are also constantly reporting that their motivation is dwindling due to the lack of ammunition at the front.\nIt is currently suspected that the Kremlin troops could soon increase their offensive efforts. “A key indication is that the Russian regional commands along the front are obviously trying to pull together additional forces,” said military expert Colonel Reisner to ntv.de. The deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Vadym Skibitskyi, recently stated the number of Kremlin troops in his country at 462,000.\n“Ukraine needs a change in strategy from important supporters”\nThe Ukrainian armed forces have increasingly gone on the defensive in recent weeks and have massively expanded their defenses along the front. The goal of Kiev’s military is to gain air superiority this year, including through the new F-16 fighter jets from the West. Ukraine is currently trying to get 45 helicopters from Australia that have been decommissioned there.\nTechnological advances, such as jamming enemy drones, should also help push back the Russian occupiers. There is still hope for a delivery of Taurus long-range missiles from Germany.\n“Ukraine needs a change of strategy from important supporters. With help for military assertiveness instead of pure survival and long-term security commitments including the prospect of NATO membership, a path to peace would be possible in 2024,” writes military expert Nico Lange on X.\n1705656578\n#Kremlin #troops #effective #NATO #admiral #sees #significant #Ukrainian #successes",

    "text": "Con toda la expectativa intacta de seguir escribiendo la historia de la Sociedad Rural de Rafaela esta mañana de jueves se inició la 117° ExpoRural de Rafaela y la Región. Con tiempo primaveral y la presencia de autoridades locales, regionales, provinciales y a nivel nacional el acto inaugural abrió las cintas del portón del predio de la avenida Brasil, para dar inicio a una edición que será a la vez la 52ª Exposición Internacional de Ganadería, Agricultura, Industria y Comercio, el 103º Concurso de Vacas Lecheras, el 66º Concurso de Dibujo y Pintura el 33º Remate de Genética de Jerarquía, las 23° Olimpíadas Agrotécnicas, la 7ª Competencia de Vacas a Campo, destacándose el 80° aniversario de la Asociación de Criadores de Holando Argentino, teniendo lugar así la Fiesta Nacional del Holando. Quien tuvo a su cargo las palabras de bienvenida fue el vicepresidente de la institución, Horacio Albrecht, con la intención de “celebrar nuestras tradiciones y éxitos en el campo, también reflexionar sobre los cambios que está experimentando nuestro mundo y cómo estos impactan en nuestra comunidad rural”. Con una mirada a futuro, habló de una profunda transformación sectorial en la que “la tecnología avanza a pasos agigantados y con ella se presentan tanto retos como oportunidades. La agricultura, la ganaderia, la lechería y todas nuestras actividades rurales están siendo reconfiguradas por las innovaciones que emergen cada día. Es nuestra responsabilidad adaptarnos a estos cambios, aprovechar las herramientas que el progreso nos brinda y seguir fortaleciendo nuestro sector”. Enfocado en las próximas generaciones indicó que “debemos inspirarlos a que se involucren en el campo, a que traigan nuevas ideas y enfoques, y a que mantengan viva la pasión por nuestras raíces”. “Cuidar nuestro ambiente no es una opción, sino una obligación. La combinación de prácticas sostenibles con el conocimiento tradicional puede garantizar que las generaciones futuras disfruten de un entorno saludable y productivo”, en tanto, “integrar la sabiduría del campo con la educación moderna nos permitirá formar personas más completas y comprometidas”, integrando a la vez a la industria, como “una sinergia” para pontenciar la economía y fortalecer las comunidades. Albrecht concluyó que con este acto, “alzamos nuestras voces juntos por un futuro donde la tradición y la modernidad se encuentren. Por un futuro donde nuestros jóvenes se sientan orgullosos de ser parte de esta tierra y su gente. Juntos, construiremos un camino sostenible y lleno de esperanza”. Fue el presidente de la SRR, Leonardo Alassia, junto a la titular del Grupo de Ayuda Mujeres Agropecuarias, Romina Romero, junto al intendente de la ciudad, Leonardo Viotti; el director Nacional de Lechería, Sebastián Alconada; y el director Provincial de Lechería, Carlos De Lorenzi, habilitaron la muestra que hasta el domingo tendrá una completa agenda de actividades para productores y público en general. Con la entonación del himno nacional y el izamiento de la bandera, a cargo de Laura Grosso, en representación de los expositores comerciales; Oscar Lungo, por los expositores de ganadería; y Rubén Davicino por la SRR. Rindiendo como cada año un sentido homenaje a los héroes de la guerra en las Islas Malvinas, el acto formal le dio paso a la recorrida de las autoridades por la muestra.

    "text": "ROME - Pope Francis, who often pleads for compassion to prisoners, washed the feet of 12 incarcerated women in Rome on Thursday in a rite marking Holy Thursday before Easter. The Argentinian Jesuit visited the Rebibbia women's prison in the northeastern outskirts of the Italian capital, where he performed the same rite in 2015. Thursday, however, was the first time the 87-year-old pontiff had dedicated his annual ritual during Holy Week solely to women. Seated in a wheelchair, the pope washed the feet of each of the prisoners, some of them in tears, before drying them off with a towel and kissing them. \"We all have small failures, big failures,\" said the pope in an impromptu homily during a mass held in the courtyard of the prison that holds some 370 women. \"But the Lord is always waiting for us, with open arms, and he never tires of forgiving,\" he added. The washing of feet is \"a gesture that draws our attention to the vocation of service,\" said Francis, who as a priest in Buenos Aires had already begun visiting prisoners. A few minutes earlier, the pontiff was all smiles as he shook hands with the inmates. Last month, the pope caught a flu that caused him to cancel some public meetings. During his subsequent recovery, he has on several occasions asked others to read his speeches. In the Christian tradition, Holy Thursday commemorates the day when Christ washed the feet of the apostles at the Last Supper. It is a highlight of Holy Week, which commemorates Christ's final days before his resurrection on Easter. Since becoming pope in 2013, the head of the Catholic Church has often visited prisons and refugee centres, including last year on Holy Thursday when he visited a juvenile detention centre and washed the feet of 12 young men. On Good Friday, he is due to preside over the \"Way of the Cross\" prayer service at Rome's Coliseum, which he was unable to attend last year as he recovered from a bronchial infection. cmk/ams/imm",

    "text": "Patriots Pursue Four-Time Pro Bowler Amari Cooper for Offense\nThe New England Patriots are actively exploring options in free agency to strengthen their offense, particularly focusing on adding talent to their receiving corps. With the highest salary cap space in the NFL this offseason, they have already made significant moves defensively, including acquiring Milton Williams. ESPN's Bill Barnwell mentioned the Patriots as a potential landing spot for four-time Pro Bowler Amari Cooper, who had a standout season with the Cleveland Browns, posting 1,250 receiving yards. Cooper's ability to play alongside various quarterbacks and achieve consistent performance has increased his value as a target for teams seeking a physical outside receiver.\n- Amari Cooper recorded 1,250 receiving yards last season, making it his career high.\n- He averaged 1.6 yards per route run, which aligns with the league average.\n- The Patriots have one of the highest salary cap spaces in the league.\n- They have already made defensive additions but need to focus on acquiring offensive help.\nAs free agency progresses, the Patriots are likely to intensify their pursuit of experienced receivers. With Cooper being linked to them, expectations may rise for a potential signing that would benefit their offense and support quarterback Drake Maye.\nBottom LineThe Patriots must capitalize on their salary cap space to enhance their receiving options, with Amari Cooper emerging as a strong candidate. Strengthening the offense is crucial for improving their competitive edge in the upcoming season.\nRead more at www.sportingnews.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "OpenAI lanza GPT-4.5: el nuevo hito en inteligencia artificial conversacional",
    "text": "OpenAI presentó este jueves GPT-4.5 , su modelo de inteligencia artificial más avanzado hasta la fecha. Según Sam Altman, CEO de la compañía, interactuar con GPT-4.5 “se siente como conversar con una persona”, destacando la capacidad del modelo para generar respuestas más naturales y contextuales.\nDisponibilidad para usuarios Plus y Pro Altman ha confirmado que GPT-4.5 estará disponible a partir de la próxima semana para los suscriptores de ChatGPT Plus y Pro . Esta estrategia busca ofrecer a los usuarios premium acceso anticipado a las últimas innovaciones en inteligencia artificial, permitiéndoles experimentar de primera mano las mejoras en comprensión y generación de lenguaje que ofrece GPT-4.5.\nGPT-4.5 is ready!\ngood news: it is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person to me. i have had several moments where i've sat back in my chair and been astonished at getting actually good advice from an AI.\nbad news: it is a giant, expensive model. we…\n— Sam Altman (@sama) February 27, 2025 “Realmente queríamos lanzarlo en los niveles Plus y Pro al mismo tiempo, pero hemos estado creciendo mucho y nos hemos quedado sin GPU. Agregaremos decenas de miles de GPU la próxima semana y lo lanzaremos al nivel Plus entonces. (cientos de miles llegarán pronto, y estoy bastante seguro de que todos usarán cada uno que podamos reunir)”, publicó Altman en su cuenta en X.\nEl desarrollo y despliegue de GPT-4.5 no han estado exentos de desafíos. OpenAI ha tenido que enfrentar una notable escasez de unidades de procesamiento gráfico (GPUs), componentes esenciales para el entrenamiento y funcionamiento de modelos de inteligencia artificial a gran escala. Esta limitación ha obligado a la compañía a optimizar sus recursos y buscar soluciones creativas para garantizar el rendimiento y la disponibilidad del nuevo modelo.\n“Este no es un modelo de razonamiento y no superará los puntos de referencia. Es un tipo diferente de inteligencia y tiene una magia que no había sentido antes. ¡Estoy muy emocionado de que la gente lo pruebe!”, añadió.\nEnfoque más allá de los benchmarks tradicionales A diferencia de versiones anteriores , GPT-4.5 no ha sido diseñado específicamente para sobresalir en pruebas de rendimiento estándar . Altman enfatiza que este modelo ofrece “una forma de inteligencia diferente”, enfocándose en una comprensión más profunda y contextual del lenguaje, lo que se traduce en interacciones más fluidas y humanas.\nEsta aproximación busca redefinir cómo se mide la eficacia de los modelos de inteligencia artificial, priorizando la calidad de la interacción sobre métricas tradicionales.\nGPT-4.5 representa un avance significativo en la escalabilidad del aprendizaje no supervisado. Al ampliar la capacidad de procesamiento y los datos de entrenamiento, el modelo ha mejorado su habilidad para reconocer patrones y generar respuestas creativas sin depender exclusivamente del razonamiento lógico.\nAdemás, se ha logrado una eficiencia computacional diez veces superior en comparación con GPT-4, lo que implica una reducción en las “alucinaciones” o respuestas inexactas generadas por el modelo.\nUn paso hacia la inteligencia artificial general Aunque GPT-4.5 no introduce capacidades revolucionarias, sienta las bases para futuros desarrollos en inteligencia artificial. OpenAI ya tiene en su hoja de ruta el lanzamiento de GPT-5, previsto para finales de mayo , que incorporará el nuevo modelo de razonamiento o3. Este avance alineará las tecnologías de OpenAI con el objetivo de crear una inteligencia artificial general (AGI), capaz de realizar tareas de manera similar o superior a los humanos.\nInvitación a la comunidad investigadora OpenAI ha lanzado GPT-4.5 como una vista previa de investigación, con el objetivo de comprender mejor sus fortalezas y limitaciones. La compañía invita a la comunidad de usuarios y desarrolladores a explorar las capacidades del nuevo modelo y a descubrir aplicaciones innovadoras que puedan surgir de su interacción. Este enfoque colaborativo busca acelerar el desarrollo de soluciones prácticas y éticas en el ámbito de la inteligencia artificial.\nEl lanzamiento de GPT-4.5 marca un hito en la evolución de los modelos de lenguaje de OpenAI , ofreciendo interacciones más naturales y una comprensión más profunda del contexto. A pesar de los desafíos técnicos y de recursos, la compañía continúa avanzando hacia su visión de una inteligencia artificial más unificada y eficiente, sentando las bases para futuros desarrollos que podrían transformar la manera en que interactuamos con la tecnología.",
