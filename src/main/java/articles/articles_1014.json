    "text": "Assam: RSS Chief Expresses Happiness over Treaty with ULFA A meeting took place at the Keshab Bhawan from 9 AM to around 9:45 AM on Saturday morning in the presence of several leaders. DIBRUGARH: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat who is currently in Assam, expressed happiness over the recent developments regarding the signing of a treaty with the United Liberation Front of Assam. Mohan Bhagwat, head of the [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh](https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/arunachal-news/security-forces-apprehend-ulfa-i-nscn-k-ya-rebels-in-arunachal-pradesh-629337) is on a visit to Assam. After a peace treaty was signed between the government and the United Liberation Front of Assam on Friday, a meeting was organised at the head office of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Dibrugarh. This meeting took place at the Keshab Bhawan from 9 AM to around 9:45 AM on Saturday morning. This meeting was attended by several key leaders including the Union Minster of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and AYUSH for the Government of India. The principal of the Assam Medical College Dr Prasanta Kumar Dihingia also attended this event. After this meeting, a senior member conveyed the opinions of the chief to the members of the media present at the Keshab Bhawan. He mentioned that this is a very positive step, which will encourage the growth of the state of Assam. Soon after the meeting, the head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh moved towards the Dibrugarh airport from where he was scheduled to travel to Kolkata. He had reached Dibrugarh late on Friday after attending a meeting of the organisation in Majuli. Addressing the Luit Subansiri Samavesh organized by the RSS’ Majuli unit on Friday, Bhagwat said, “We have to develop our nation on the basis of Bharat’s time-tested selfhood.” He questioned the audience: despite achieving her hard-earned independence, had Bharat been able to retain the “Swa” or selfhood, in it? “Also, a pertinent question is valid forever: without patriotism and unity among ourselves, long-lasting independence will be at stake. The main reason behind the formation of the RSS is to awaken our society towards making it patriotic and organized.” Also Read: [Assam: Peace accord signed with United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) ](https://www.sentinelassam.com/topheadlines/assam-peace-accord-signed-with-united-liberation-front-of-asom-ulfa-683784#google_vignette) Also Watch:",

    "text": "This topic was written by Sultan Al-Qahtani – The price of the Oral-B iO Series 7 smart electric toothbrush has dropped to $149 on the Amazon store after a $71 discount. This deal comes as part of a larger sale that includes a 55 percent discount on Oral-B toothbrushes. The iO Series 7 is a top pick for smart toothbrushes because it strikes a good balance between features and affordability, especially if you can get it at the current price. The toothbrush has a black and white LED display that tells you useful information such as mode, battery life, and how much time is left on the two-minute timer. The brush head comes with strong vibration, but it does not cause numbness to the lips like other smart toothbrushes. The illuminated ring also indicates whether you are pressing too hard or not hard enough. If you want to brush your teeth while looking at your phone, you can watch an entertainment animation of a set of teeth slowly turning from blue to white as internal sensors track the brush’s position and movement. The brush comes with a replacement head, case and charging base which you should only need to use twice a month. Source",
