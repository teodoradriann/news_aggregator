    "title": "Chances of '15 day snow bomb' as forecaster says 'risk is growing'",
    "text": "Reports that a '15-day\nsnow bomb' could hit the UK in early January should be \"treated with caution\", the Met Office has said. Exacta Weather had predicted severe snowfall in early 2024.\nThere has even been talk of a second Beast from the East. Officially known as anticyclone Hartmut, the Beast from the East saw heavy snow and freezing conditions strike the UK in 2018.\nBut Met Office forecasters are urging caution over claims snowfall could hit the UK after Storm Gerritt sparked chaos across the country during\nChristmas week, as BirminghamLive reports. The Exeter-based weather forecaster said that it is too early to give any real details, but said models indicate that a SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event could occur on January 4 or 5.\nRead More:\nThousands heading for Cornwall festive dip will swim in sewage-dumped waters, Lib Dems say\nRead More:\nMystic Baba Vanga's predictions she got right - and what 2024 has in store\nJames Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, had said: “The risk is growing for a prolonged cold and snowy spell as we head into the early part of January. This is due to the risk growing for another SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event within this period, and this could bring the threat of another Beast from the East in early 2024.\n“There are now strong indications for a major SSW to occur during the early part of January, and if it does, many parts of the UK can expect to end up in the freezer with snow events and severe cold weather.”\nBut in response, a Met Office forecaster said: “Models are indicating there could be one (SSW) on 4 or 5 January. But it’s too early to give any real details and we have to wait to see if one actually happens. If it does then we would possibly see the effects towards the end of January.”\nIn recent years some extreme cold, winter snow events have all been connected to the surface effects of sudden stratospheric warming. An SSW was to blame for the infamous Beast from the East weather blast back in 2018. The term sudden stratospheric warming refers to what is observed in the stratosphere:- a rapid warming (up to about 50 °C in just a couple of days), between 10 km and 50 km above the earth’s surface.\nOn its website, the Met Office explains: \"Usually a few weeks later, we can start to see knock-on effects on the jet stream, which in turn effects our weather lower down (in the troposphere). However, the stratospheric sudden warming doesn’t happen every year, and it doesn’t always affect our weather when it does.\"\nIt means that northern Europe, including the UK is likely to get a long spell of dry, cold weather, whereas southern Europe will tend to be more mild, wet and windy. \"On the boundary of these areas, cold easterly winds develop and in some cases the drop in temperatures leads to snow,\" the Met Office says.\nIn its long-range forecast on their website, the Met Office say: \"Into the new year it now looks finely balanced whether near or slightly above temperatures will be in place across the south, with periods of rain, wind, and showers. Or if the slightly below average temperatures in place across the north; where showers will remain wintry, will manage to filter southwards or not. If the colder air filters southwards wintry showers could be seen across parts of England and Wales, and it is possible some more significant snowfall could occur along the mild / cold air boundary.\n\"Thereafter, more settled conditions are expected to gradually develop more widely, increasing the risk of frost and fog. If this were to occur day on day net cooling would lead to below average temperatures, with an increased threat of winter hazards, including ice/snow.\"\nFrom January 11 to January 25, it adds: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled / milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic. Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"",

    "title": "Google nest smart learning thermostat 3rd gen not heating",
    "text": "49m ago\nI bought my Google nest smart learning thermostat third GEN a couple months ago and everything has been fine until it started getting cold here in Florida. We started using the heat and I noticed when I woke up the last few mornings that it was very cold in the house The temperature was 67° but the thermostat was set to 72. It says it’s on and running and has a countdown until it reaches 10 but neverachieves temperature. I went outside and noticed that the outside unit is not coming on. If I turn the air conditioning on the outside unit kicks on and when I turn the heat on right after it kicked on after a delay yesterday, but now after trying the same thing again this morning when it did it again it’s not coming on at all now. It has to be the thermostat I can get the air conditioning to work but not the heat. I reversed the wires in the system to blow heat on the air conditioning and it seems to be working but now there’s no way to control the temperature. Anybody have any ideas on how to fix?",

    "title": "Geraldine Jennings takes on singing and acting",
    "text": "Geraldine Jennings takes on singing and acting\nMANILA, Philippines — When someone is primed for the big time, talent will always out.\nBritish-Filipina singer-actress Geraldine Jennings displayed her talent even when she was still a child. In the UK, where her family moved to, she joined singing contests and got exposed to talent contests early on.\nShe attended the British School Manila when she was younger before the family moved to the UK in 2009.\nLater, the Jennings also moved to Edinburgh in Scotland, where Geraldine attended Fettes College and Loretto School in her last year in high school.\nEven if the family resides abroad, Geraldine makes it a point to visit the Philippines at least three times a year during her vacation and school breaks. The Jennings have a second home in Manila. Her mom, Gina Cariaga, goes with her whenever Geraldine returns to Manila.\nShe idolized Miley Cyrus when she was growing up and sings Miley’s songs like Flowers and earlier, even Party in the USA. “Miley is my inspiration, musical-wise,” Geraldine said. “I love her musical style, how she sings, how she performs and how she improved a lot.”\n“Acting-wise, I also love Gal Gadot, one of my favorites in Wonder Woman, as well as Margot Robbie,” Geraldine added. “She was amazing in Barbie and Wolf of Wall Street. Very versatile.”\nGeraldine is still in school in the UK and has two more years to finish her studies. While she is on a break, she made it a point to do an original recording and started principal photography of her launching movie with a working title, La Isla Babuyan.\nGeraldine, who is half-Filipina, half-European, is paired with young actor Jameson Blake in La Isla Babuyan. She also gets to work with Urian winning actress Lotlot de Leon, as Rose, her mother.\nThe film shows the relationship of mother and daughter and their interaction with society, as well as their relationship with the men in their lives.\nGeraldine essays the character of Anastasia, who meets and falls in love with the handsome Jordan, portrayed by Jameson, the scion and heir of a wealthy family. The latter’s stepmother (Nathalie Hart), Margot, however, can’t accept Anastasia and will do everything to keep them apart.\n“Acting is really challenging,” admitted Geraldine. “It was really different from merely studying it. It was really natural to me. I love acting. Last September, I did an acting workshop before I started La Isla Babuyan.\n“I learned a lot from actually being on the set and doing it. I got to feel the vibe, feel the scene. You’re actually the character. It’s not acting. I learned a lot from my co-stars.”\nGeraldine has a language coach and a Tagalog tutor whom she sees even online once a week.\nCompleting the cast of La Isla Babuyan are Marco Gumabao as Javier, the expert matadero in their town, James Blanco as David, the ambitious political father of Jordan, Dave Borneo as Caloy, the boy smitten with Anastasia’s charms.\nAlso introducing in La Isla Babuyan is Samantha da Roza as Jasmin, the adopted daughter of Rose. Samantha comes from the known Diaz family. She is the grandchild of actress Gloria Diaz.\nMegged by Abdel Langit, La Isla Babuyan is bankrolled by Solid Gold Entertainment Production. The screenplay was written by Jessie Vilabrille from a story conceptualized by Leo Dominguez, Jessie Villabrille and Barn Salvani. Line producer is Dennis Evangelista. Co-producers are Gina Jennings and Yohann Soyangco.\nBorn in the Philippines to a Northern Irish/British father and a Filipina mother, Geraldine is the second in a brood of four girls. Geraldine enrolled early on in singing classes when her family was still in Los Angeles. “I got to love the craft,” she attested. “My first love is singing and playing the guitar. I am also passionate about acting.”\nFor the past three years, Geraldine has been asked by talent manager Leo Dominguez to try singing professionally.\n“I joined a singing competition, Teenstar UK (United Kingdom) in 2018 and reached the finals,” Geraldine shared. “Finally, I was able to give singing a try. I also won the prestigious future music award in the Open Mic singing competition in the UK and got to perform at the O2 Arena in London.”\nGeraldine also tried to appear in TV commercials in the Philipines. “I did the Creamsilk commercial when I was six years old,” she shared. “That was where I started.”\nAt this point, Geraldine finds it hard to choose between singing and acting. “I actually love both equally,” she asserted. “Singing is my first love, but I’m starting to love acting more and more as I do it. I love being versatile. I love learning. It’s hard to choose.”\nRecently, Geraldine recorded an original song, If I Will Ever Love Again, penned by Ogie Alcasid. “It’s a really beautiful, sweet love song,” Geraldine said. “The song will be out on Spotify and I am shooting a music video soon.”\nThe song will be released under the Leo’s LBD music label.",
