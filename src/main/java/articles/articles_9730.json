    "text": "With its December 6 release date on the horizon, Marvel Rivals has already gotten fans excited. The 5v5 team-based shooter from NetEase Games has brought a fresh take on the hero shooter genre. If you were hoping to pick it up on your Nintendo Switch though, you’ll be disappointed.\nThe developers have made it clear that, as of now, there are no discussions about bringing the game to the popular handheld console. This news is not entirely unexpected given the technical demands of the game. The Switch is also notoriously underpowered so it makes sense.\nMarvel Rivals Looks Promising But Switch Users Won’t Get To Play It ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ × Marvel Rivals , developed by NetEase Games, is set to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This choice of platforms is tied to the game’s use of Unreal Engine 5, which powers its impressive visuals and intense, chaotic battles.\nI’m sure we can talk about a Switch 2 port in a year or so, but yeah, I don’t see Marvel Rivals running adequately on the current Switch.\n— Lethal Cadence (@LethalCadence) August 28, 2024 Expand Tweet During an interview with Pocket Tactics at Gamescom, game director Thaddeus Sasser was candid about the possibility of a mobile or Switch version, stating flatly that “ there are no discussions ” regarding these platforms.\nThe lack of a Switch port is disappointing, but understandable to many, especially considering the game’s massive appeal. Despite this, the game has gotten a lot of praise before its release and fans are only excited to see more of it.\nRELATED Marvel Rivals’ Two Newest Characters are a Masterclass in Superhero Craft However, Sasser’s comments indicate that the game’s technical demands outweigh the benefits of a handheld version, at least for now. Maybe the successor to the Switch that may or may not be coming could be a better candidate in the future.\nThe Game Just Seems To Get Everything Right Marvel Rivals has the potential for greatness. | Image Credit: NetEase For now, those eager to dive into NetEase ‘s next game will need to do so on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S. The game promises a rich roster of Marvel characters, from Captain America and Winter Soldier to Spider-Man and Hulk, all of whom will be available at launch without the need for microtransactions.\nThat’s disappointing for Switch fans, but fingers crossed they’ll consider it in the future! The Switch would be perfect for a game like #MarvelRivals .\n— Rajali (@b_rajaliyar) August 28, 2024 Expand Tweet This approach is a refreshing change in a genre often criticized for its monetization strategies. Marvel Rivals focuses on delivering an authentic Marvel experience, complete with team-up moves between characters that are flashy and powerful.\nRELATED NetEase Will Encounter the Same Issue Every Superhero Game Before It Has, Meaning We Won’t Be Getting At Least One Hero in Marvel Rivals Despite this, there is still hope for a future Marvel Rivals release on a handheld platform. Speculation is already mounting about the next-generation Nintendo console, often referred to as the “ Switch 2 .”\nWith more powerful hardware expected, a port might be possible once the new console is released.\nThis speculation, however, remains just that—speculation. As of now, there is no official word on whether NetEase Entertainment plans to revisit the idea of a Switch or mobile version once the new hardware becomes available.",

    "title": "Hope through art: Glenn's Easter message and how Jesus has inspired his artwork - Glenn Beck",
    "text": "An Easter message from Glenn: I think Holy Week is the most important week of the year, both religiously speaking and as a human being. The problems that we face in America today, and quite honestly, in the entire Western world, are due to a lack of forgiveness, a lack of grace, and a lack of an understanding of the atonement. Suicide rates are up. People think there's no need to live anymore, that nothing is real. They don't realize that they're not a human having a spiritual experience. They're a spirit having a human experience. They don't realize that you are here, at this time, for a reason. No matter what you've done, it doesn't matter. You are here for a reason, and the atonement is for you. It took me a while to believe that. I used to believe in those lies, and it's what made me drink and become an alcoholic. I couldn't live in the world that I had created with so many things that I was ashamed of. Everything just piled on, and the mountain I created seemed insurmountable. It wasn't until I stopped drinking and went to AA that I began to find hope again, but I still couldn't let go of the past—not until I was baptized. When I was baptized, I remember calling out to God in my head while I was in the water, saying, \"You promise! You cease to be God if you don't live up to your promise, and that promise is to live the way you ask me to live and to do the things you ask me to do to the best of my ability, and you will take all the things from my past away from me.\" I'm telling you, my life changed overnight. It's real. A lot of people who even profess that it's real don't act like it is. It's something that you have to put into practice every single day and be grateful for. It is the greatest gift ever given. And that's what we're supposed to celebrate on Easter: the resurrection. Our world is always on the razor's edge between the beautiful and the broken. As Glenn so powerfully said, people are struggling to find the will to live, to find ultimate purpose and hope in a world that repeatedly shouts that there are none. We are considered material beings who have pseudo-spiritual experiences rather than spiritual beings who are enfleshed in human bodies. If we are no more than flesh and bones, what ultimate hope do we have? This is exactly where Glenn was before he found God. That's why he turned to things like alcohol—to blunt the pain of not having ultimate hope and purpose. Don't we all do the same? We all have our ways of alleviating the nearly unlivable burden of life without God or coping with the fear that this world is all there is, that we have no ultimate hope beyond our temporal successes and failures. Thankfully, that wasn't the end of Glenn's story, and it doesn't have to be the end of yours either. On [Easter](https://www.glennbeck.com/blog/glenn-beck-good-friday-fast), we celebrate the atonement of our sins given to us through the life and death of Jesus. [His atonement](https://www.glennbeck.com/radio/glenns-vital-easter-message) means that our lives become his, and the shame and guilt of our past are washed clean. Glenn has been inspired by the life and work of Jesus [in his art](https://glennbeckart.com/). Here are six of Glenn's paintings inspired by Christ and the work He continues to do through His followers. If you consider purchasing any one of Glenn's prints or giclees, all proceeds go to the [American Journey Experience](https://americanjourneyexperience.com/). Shroud of Turin This is Glenn's rendition of the “Shroud of Turin,” the burial cloth that many believe to have been wrapped around Jesus in those sorrowful days in the tomb following the cross, miraculously imprinting our Savior’s face into the fabric. Glenn literally sanded down his painted rendition of Jesus' face to create the same effect that you would see on the shroud. Glenn had Oxford Ph.D and pastor Jeremiah Johnson on his show to discuss the historicity of the Shroud of Turin, and the evidence for it is nothing short but breathtaking. Johnson mentioned how C.S. Lewis had a painting of the Shroud in his home to always remind him that \"my God has a face.\" Glenn's painting could be the same reminder of hope in your home. Jesus A message from Glenn: While painting the Shroud [of Turin], it made me wonder, “What did Jesus’ face look like at the very moment of His resurrection? What if we had a shroud capturing the very moment when Jesus arose from death to life?” The painting of the Shroud captures the tired countenance of Jesus, having endured the suffering of the cross and peacefully awaiting His glorious resurrection. In contrast, the resurrected face of Jesus in this painting is happy now that the pain and suffering of the cross is over. His mouth is firm with determination to see His Father’s mission complete, yet His eyes compassionately gaze into those of the viewers, beckoning them to accept the joy and peace that He offers. His overall countenance is peaceful and relieved, that by His suffering, others can be saved and redeemed. That is what inspired this painting. Praise In All Things This painting shows Corrie Ten Boom and her sister Betsie in the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp. The Ten Booms, a devout Christian family from Amsterdam, were caught by the SS protecting Jews in their home, and they were all sentenced to concentration camps. There was a lice infestation in their bunker, and Betsie asked her sister of what good God could possibly bring out of such a situation. Corrie encouraged her sister to have faith—and God worked. Due to the lice infestation, Corrie and Betsie's bunker was quarantined, and they were able to host nightly Bible studies with the inmates. Glenn purposefully depicted each of the inmates' faces to convey a particular emotion we may feel on our journey toward God. Some inmates express anger and resentment. Others express disillusionment and hollowness. Others show signs of curiosity yet trepidation. Some are down right tired and weary. Chances are, you've experienced some or even many of these emotions throughout your journey to God. But God is present, even in the deepest of affliction, and it is there that His atonement is offered to us. Chinese Jesus This painting was inspired when Glenn heard about the atrocities in Maoist China, especially one is particular. The Chinese Communist Party would make individuals stand up in the public square and denounce every affiliation except their loyalty to the state. If they refused, they would be beaten, tortured, or even worse. Glenn's painting depicts Jesus standing in the public square, accused, beaten, tortured, but he refuses to denounce who He is and who His father is. The sign written in Mandarin hanging around Jesus' neck says, \"Son of a King.\" Holocaust Jesus A message from Glenn: This painting is very personal for me. I painted this one because the Lord scolded me one day. I was complaining to Him about my job. I was complaining, “Please Lord, I can’t look at this stuff anymore. There’s so much suffering and evil in the world. Give me an answer on how to turn it around. Anything.” The Lord has made it very clear to me over the years, “You’re supposed to warn. That is your job.” But in that moment, I was so weary, and I asked Him, “What else can I look at? What else can I report on? Is there anything else?” This is how the Lord answered me: “You can look in a lot of places. But I am always in the center of every place you do not want to look. I am always in the center of the darkest places, because I am always comforting those in those places. I am with them. You can turn your face away from suffering, but you won’t find me there. You will find me in the suffering.” I tried to bring what the Lord told me to life on the canvas. This painting pictures Christ if he had lived in Nazi Germany. He would likely have been in a concentration camp—as He would have wanted to. He delights in comforting those in the deepest suffering. His prison uniform features the letters, “TCXC,” which are the Greek letters for “Jesus Christ.” I’m not good enough to paint the face of Christ, but I wanted to remember the scolding that He gave me, reminding me that leading and encouraging people through suffering and darkness is where the heart of Christ dwells.",

    "text": "GlobeNewswire Curex Revolutionizing Allergy Immunotherapy with Telehealth and Home-Delivered Allergy Drops Read full article Curex 29 December 2023 at 1:00 am · 3-min read Curex\nNew York,NY, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allergy sufferers looking to treat their allergies without the pain and inconvenience of weekly visits to their doctor now have an ally in an at-home allergy offering developed by Curex.\nCurex Allergy Immunotherapy, Allergy Drops Online allergy clinic, Curex, is transforming how allergies are treated in the US with its affordable convenient alternative to allergy shots.\nAllergy immunotherapy is a proven approach to treating allergies, offering the promise of long-lasting relief. In contrast to traditional allergy medication that focus merely on alleviating symptoms, immunotherapy aims to tackle the root cause of allergies by desensitizing the body to specific allergens. However, conventional allergy immunotherapy often involves frequent in-person visits to an allergist's office, adding a time-consuming and inconvenient aspect to the treatment. Studies have shown that up to 75% of allergy sufferers discontinue allergy shots due to these challenges. But now, there is a better way.\nCurex offers an improved method of desensitization from allergies through its safe, effective, and convenient at-home alternative to traditional allergy shots. Curex's allergy immunotherapy treatment ensures long-term relief and includes the same composition as allergy shots, with the sole distinction being that it's administered sublingually (under the tongue). Moreover, Curex is competitively priced, with an average cost 62% lower than that of shots. Curex accepts major insurance plans and offers a self-pay option as well. The convenience of this approach results in three times better adherence to the treatment, and Curex anticipates that this will eventually yield significantly improved outcomes compared to allergy shots.\nAllergy sufferers seeking relief through Curex must first share some details about their symptoms, allowing Curex’s doctors to facilitate an allergy test. Most people can undergo testing conveniently at home, either with the assistance of a medical professional who visits them or by using a testing kit shipped to their home for the collection of a small blood sample. Once the lab concludes the test, patients will receive personalized treatment recommendations, including a prescription for allergy immunotherapy.\nStory continues\nUpon beginning treatment, a pharmacy will formulate personalized sublingual allergy drops for the customer and dispatch them directly to the customer's home.\nSublingual immunotherapy is gluten-free and formulated from all-natural clinical-grade allergen extracts. Suitable for adults and children aged 5 years and older, it effectively addresses allergies triggered by pollens, cats, dogs, molds, dust mites, grasses, and weeds. The treatment is versatile, allowing administration anywhere, and optimal results are achieved through consistent usage.\nCurex was founded by Gene Kakaulin and Charles Jacoby, who both suffer from allergies. Like many allergy sufferers, Charles and Gene were averse to allergy shots. Motivated by their need for a superior alternative, they realized that allergy immunotherapy extended beyond shots. The sublingual immunotherapy program was developed from extensive research and collaboration with pharmacists and allergists. Since then, the company has served over 150,000 satisfied users. Among those customers is Kelly, who suffered from cat allergies. Faced with the challenge of dating a man with a cat, she turned to Curex for relief, envisioning a future with him. Within three months, her symptoms were alleviated, allowing her to interact with the cat without any allergic reactions. Today, they're happily married.\nAnother Curex customer, Lauren, said: \"Curex fits my life way more than allergy shots, especially since I travel frequently. I've already noticed an improvement in my symptoms compared to where I started, and it's a relief not to be on any allergy medications for once.\"\nIn the spirit of transformative relief, Curex continues to redefine allergy management, providing solutions that resonate with individuals like Kelly and Lauren, fostering not just symptom alleviation but the creation of fulfilling, allergy-free lives.\nFor more information about Curex, visit getcurex.com .\nWebsite URL: getcurex.com\nCONTACT: Gene Kakaulin Curex hi at getcurex.com\nTRENDING 1.
