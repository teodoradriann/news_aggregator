    "title": "Michel Wieviorka, sociologist: ‘Jews are the scapegoat par excellence’ | Culture | EL PAÍS English",
    "text": "Members of this French sociologist’s family died in the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism is not something abstract for him, it is history and family memory. But Michel Wieviorka was lucky enough to grow up in another era, in a secular and progressive, cultured and republican environment in the post-war period. And throughout his life he has “almost never” been personally confronted with hatred of the Jews. When asked what place his Judaism occupies in his identity, he says: “It’s not what generally comes to mind first, but I don’t hide it. I don’t minimize it.” We spoke in an office at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS), his academic home. It is a place steeped in history. There is intellectual history: Fernand Braudel and his teacher Alain Touraine, among others, taught here. And national history: the building was on the location of the Cherche-Midi prison, which was used by the Germans during the occupation. From the window you can see the Hotel Lutetia, where the Jews who survived the Nazi camps returned. The veteran intellectual has just published Antisemitism explained to young people (Spanish translation by Agustina Blanco) and The last Jewish joke. Golden age and decline of Jewish humor (in French). Question. Has a new anti-Semitism been unleashed since Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7? An increase in anti-Semitic acts has been recorded in France and other countries. Answer. I would not say that it is a new anti-Semitism, but that an anti-Semitism that already existed has been amplified. Q. What happened? A. It has given sectors of the left the opportunity to allow what I would call a soft, muffled denial to appear. It is not the denial that says that the gas chambers did not exist. It is a denial to the extent that there are those who say: ‘I’m keeping quiet about what happened on October 7. It is not important. It does not deserve to be commented on, and Hamas are the resistance. They are freedom fighters.’ It is not an explicit anti-Semitism that says: ‘I want the death of the Jews, or to destroy them.’ It is anti-Semitism to the extent that a very violent, criminal, terrorist act is covered in silence. Q. Is it surprising that anti-Semitism, which was associated with the extreme right, is now found on the left? A. In France, the classical left is very weak. On the other hand, the much more radicalized hard left is strong, and this left tries to woo the immigrant electorate, who are often of Arab origin or of the Muslim faith, but not necessarily. In this universe, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is seen differently than in other universes. Q. And the extreme right denies anti-Semitism. A. It is the paradox. The institutional extreme right presents itself as hostile to anti-Semitism. Marine Le Pen has made clear decisions in this regard by saying that she rejects it, but from the political space in which anti-Semitism existed. Q. That’s good news, right? A. It’s good news, which doesn’t mean it’s totally true. Furthermore, this party allies itself with other far-right parties in Europe in which anti-Semitism is more active or visible. It’s a fragile positioning, and we may wonder what lies beneath. And secondly, this does not prevent there from being an extreme right with skinheads, neo-Nazis, or anti-Semitic intellectuals. This is the political landscape. Q. And what about beyond politics? A. There is the infrapolitical landscape of violence and hatred. Violence is anonymous and we must incriminate — in part and with great caution — the world coming from Arab-Muslim immigration. In this universe there is anti-Semitism, in the form of prejudices and anti-Semitic acts. On the other side of the board, but an infrapolitical board, there are those who desecrate graves in Jewish cemeteries. This is the landscape. To which we must add one last thing: they are people with the idea that Jews want to control the media and control opinion, and limit freedom of expression. Q. There is a slogan in pro-Palestinian demonstrations since October 7 and since Israel’s attack on Gaza began: “From the river to the sea.” The idea is that there should be a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean and, therefore, Israel should disappear. What do you think? A. When it is said that a state recognized by the UN must disappear, it is saying something different than criticizing a political regime. I hate Netanyahu. If I just say that I hate Netanyahu and that I hope Israel changes its government and policies and takes the path of peace, very good. I think so. But if I say that the problem is not Netanyahu, but the existence of the State of Israel, with or without Netanyahu, then I get into anti-Semitism. The idea that there cannot be a state because it is Jewish. If I tell you “from the river to the sea there should not be a single Jew in this part of the world, this state must disappear”, this is anti-Semitism. Q. How do you define yourself? Are you a Zionist or a non-Zionist? A. I like the word I once heard [former environmentalist deputy and May 1968 youth leader] Daniel Cohn-Bendit say: a-Zionist. I am not interested in debating whether I am for or against the existence of the State of Israel. It exists. Asking for its destruction is out of the question. That’s it. This does not mean that I will defend Netanyahu’s policies. Having said that, I will explain something to you. I feel a bit like Camus during the Algerian war. One day he wrote a letter to his friend Jean Sénac. He told him: “I’ll shut up. I can’t talk anymore.” He felt torn. Well, in this conflict I feel torn. I cannot support Israel 100% and I cannot defend Hamas. What can I do? Around me I see mostly people who are in one camp or another. I don’t want to be in a camp, I want to be with those who want peace. It is not easy. So I don’t say much. Q. Was October 7 a pogrom? A. It had the dimensions and the logic of a pogrom. But not only that. It also had a military logic. The pogroms did not have a military purpose. They consisted of throwing spears at the population to kill Jews in a town. In general, there was a more or less explicit agreement in central Europe between the power and the population. But it was not for military purposes. There is a mix here. Q. How have you experienced what happened since that day? A. I am part of those who find the way in which Israel carries out its war today shocking. Shocking. I can«t defend this war. Even less because it causes tens of thousands of victims on the Palestinian side and because, furthermore, it is Israel»s denial of a principle to which its citizens feel attached: «Everything for the hostages.» Q. Anti-Semitism began at least two millennia ago. Will it ever end? A. It transforms. Anti-Semitism, in fact, is a word that dates back to the late 19th century. Before there was anti-Judaism. It is true that the Jewish people are the only ones to have known 2,000 years of persecution, hatred, destruction, but also resilience, resistance, and the ability to create humor. Will anti-Semitism endure in a renewed form? Unfortunately, I think so, and what we are experiencing at this time rather feeds it. Q. What do you mean? A. The behavior of the Israeli Army and the Israeli Government generates hatred towards Israel and hatred towards the Jews, who many people think that [Jews around the world] are the allies of this government. But anti-Semitism is not born from this government action. Anti-Semitism has found something to feed on. You can detest a government without having to detest the affected population, especially when it does not depend on it, as is the case of the Jews in the diaspora. Q. Anti-Semites do not need Israel to do what it does to be anti-Semitic. A. No, of course not. The spread of anti-Semitism is fueled by context, but it is irrational, it works by creating scapegoats. There is no society that, at one time or another, does not seek an explanation for its misfortunes or its difficulties or its crises, and the Jews are formidable because it can always be said that they conspire, or that they act in the shadows. They are the scapegoat par excellence and there is no reason, unfortunately, for that to disappear.

    "title": "At DNC, Republican Adam Kinzinger Says Trump ‘Suffocated the Soul’ of GOP",
    "text": "As one of only two Republicans who served on the Jan. 6 Committee, Adam Kinzinger gave credibility to the congressional investigation of the insurrectionist riot. Now the former Illinois congressman is brandishing his Republican roots to elevate Kamala Harris’ campaign for President.\nIn a short speech at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night, Kinzinger offered a full-fledged endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket. “I’m proud to be in the trenches with you as part of this sometimes awkward alliance,” he said, “to defend truth, democracy, and decency.”\nBut much of Kinzinger’s remarks were aimed at his longtime adversary: former President Donald Trump, whom he excoriated as a toxic force in American politics. “Donald Trump has suffocated the soul of the Republican Party,” he said. “His fundamental weakness has coursed through my party like an illness. Sapping our strength. Softening our spine. Whipping us into a fever that has untethered us from our values.”\nAfter a violent mob attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Kinzinger became one of Trump’s most vocal and vociferous GOP critics. He was one of 10 Republican House members to vote to impeach Trump after the assault. He and former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney were the only Republicans to serve on the panel that ultimately recommended criminal charges against Trump. Not coincidentally, neither of the two are still in Congress. Kinzinger chose not to seek reelection, and Cheney lost to a Trump-backed primary challenger.\nA former lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, Kinzinger invoked his national security bona fides to lambaste Trump for abandoning the muscular internationalism that has defined decades of U.S. foreign policy. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” he said. “How can a party claim to stand for liberty if it sees a fight for freedom in Ukraine, an attack pitting tyranny against democracy, a challenge to everything our nation claims to be?”\nLast February, Trump petrified America’s traditional allies by saying at a campaign rally that Russia could “do whatever the hell they want” to a NATO country he believes doesn’t spend enough on collective defense. He’s also suggested he might not maintain aid to Ukraine’s defense against Russia. “I wouldn’t give unless Europe starts equalizing,” Trump told TIME in April “If Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay?”\nKinzinger portrayed Trump’s behavior and policies as a disqualifier, whereas Harris would uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, he said. “I know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and democracy,” Kinzinger said. “Whatever policies we disagree on pale in comparison with those fundamental matters of principle.”\nTo that end, Kinzinger encouraged his fellow Republicans to reject the party to which he devoted much of his adult life. “I urge you: Make the right choice,” he said. “Vote for our bedrock values. Vote for Kamala Harris.”\nThe post At DNC, Republican Adam Kinzinger Says Trump ‘Suffocated the Soul’ of GOP appeared first on TIME .",

    "text": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests.\nHere is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nSome forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate.\nNot all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end.\n– Avon & Somerset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nThe force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

    "text": "Man dies at illegal de-addiction centre, mother alleges torture\nAmarjit Singh (35) of Patel Nagar in Malout town died at an illegal de-addiction centre at Sarawan Bodla village near here under mysterious circumstances.\nAmarjit’s mother Manjit Kaur alleged in a police complaint that her son was tortured and brutally thrashed on Monday. Acting on the complaint, the Kabarwala police have registered a case against unidentified persons.\nManjit Kaur alleged that her son was a drug addict and he was admitted to the de-addiction centre being run at a “dera” about five months ago. “We were not allowed to meet Amarjit, but always told to pay monthly fee. On Monday, when we went to bring Amarjit back home, he told us that he was thrashed because we failed to pay the fee on time. He had become very weak. He was taken to the Civil Hospital, Malout, and later to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, where he passed away,” she said.\nMeanwhile, deceased’s wife Kamaljit Kaur has demanded a stern action in the case. The deceased had a daughter and a son. His relatives said nearly 50 more addicts were admitted to that de-addiction centre.\nDr Jagdeep Chawla, Chief Medical Officer, Muktsar, said, “The de-addiction centre is not approved by the Health Department. We are writing to the Deputy Commissioner to form a committee to look into the matter.”\nMeanwhile, the body has been sent to the Government Medical College and Hospital in Faridkot for a post-mortem examination.",

    "text": "Pistons get scheduling blow from NBA amid record losing streak\nAs if 27 in a row wasn’t enough, the Detroit Pistons are taking another L.\nThe NBA announced in a release on Thursday that the Pistons are now getting one less home game. Their scheduled contest on Feb. 26 against the New York Knicks (originally supposed to be played at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit) has now been moved to Madison Square Garden in New York. The league says that this is because of “unique scheduling complications associated with the In-Season Tournament.”\nThe following was released by the NBA:\n[pic.twitter.com/rqeH5ibTGF]\n— NBA Communications (@NBAPR)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThat reasoning makes perfect sense since the NBA’s inaugural In-Season Tournament put this season’s schedule in flux leaguewide (depending on which teams advanced to the later stages). As a result, the Knicks ended up with 40 home games and the Pistons got 42 (a discrepancy that the NBA has now fixed with this move).\nBut the timing of the announcement just makes it feel like the league is kicking the Pistons while they are down. The team just punched their ticket to the Hall of Shame with a defeat Tuesday to the Brooklyn Nets, their all-time NBA record-setting 27th loss in a row. But perhaps this is actually a show of mercy from the NBA in sparing the Pistons from having to hear\nthose savage chants from their own fans for an additional game.",
