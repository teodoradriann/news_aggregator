    "text": "'Click-to-cancel' rule makes it easier to opt out of subscriptions The Federal Trade Commission today announced a [final “click-to-cancel” rule](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/negative-option-rule-final-rule) that will require sellers to make it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up. Most of the final rule’s provisions will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register. “Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” said Commission Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.” The commission’s updated rule will apply to almost all negative option programs in any media. The rule also will prohibit sellers from misrepresenting any material facts while using negative option marketing; require sellers to provide important information before obtaining consumers’ billing information and charging them; and require sellers to get consumers’ informed consent to the negative option features before charging them. The final rule announced today is part of the FTC’s ongoing review of its 1973 Negative Option Rule, which the agency is modernizing to combat unfair or deceptive practices related to subscriptions, memberships, and other recurring-payment programs in an increasingly digital economy in which it’s easier than ever for businesses to sign up consumers for their products and services. Commission approval and publication follows the [March 2023 announcement of a notice of proposed rulemaking](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring) which resulted in more than 16,000 comments from consumers and federal and state government agencies, consumer groups, and trade associations. While negative option marketing programs can be convenient for sellers and consumers, the FTC receives thousands of complaints about negative option and recurring subscription practices each year. The number of complaints has been steadily increasing over the past five years and in 2024 the Commission received nearly 70 consumer complaints per day on average, up from 42 per day in 2021. FTC staff has developed a [fact sheet](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/NegOptions-1page-Oct2024-v2.pdf) summarizing the changes to the rule. The primary staffer on this matter is Katherine Johnson in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and [protect and educate consumers](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection).

    "title": "San Antonio police release video of persons of interest in killing of pregnant Texas teen Savanah Soto and boyfriend Matthew Guerra - CBS News",
    "text": "Persons of interest sought in Texas shooting deaths Police seek 2 persons of interest in shooting deaths of pregnant Texas teen and her boyfriend 01:22 The San Antonio Police Department on Thursday released video of two persons of interest in the shooting deaths of a pregnant teenager and her boyfriend .\nSavanah Nicole Soto, 18, and her boyfriend, Matthew Guerra, 22, were both reported missing last week before they were found dead in Guerra's car on Tuesday. The couple disappeared a day before Soto, who was 9 months pregnant, was scheduled to be induced to give birth.\nThe medical examiner's office confirmed Thursday that the bodies found in the car belonged to Guerra and Soto. Police said each of the victims had a gunshot wound.\nThe video released Thursday shows a person of interest driving a dark pickup truck, described by Police Chief Bill McManus as a Chevy Silverado with a bed cover, and another person driving Guerra's Kia Optima. The video was taken \"nearby where the bodies were found,\" the police department wrote on Facebook.\nOn 12/26/23, two victims were found deceased in a vehicle at the 5900 block of Danny Kaye. The Medical Examiner’s office identified one of the victims as 22-year old Matthew Guerra. The second victim has yet to be named, but is identied as a full-term pregnant female. Below is video footage taken from a nearby location of where the bodies were found. In the video, are two persons of interest, one driving a dark colored pickup truck, the other driving the victims’ Silver Kia Optima. Anyone with any information on this dark colored pickup truck, with a bed cover, or the two persons of interest seen in this video, is encouraged to call SAPD Homicide at (210) 207-7674 or (210) 207-7440. You can remain anonymous when providing any information on this case.\nPosted by San Antonio Police Department on Thursday, December 28, 2023 McManus did not elaborate on the exact location of the video other than to say it was recorded \"very close to\" where the bodies were found and that it was recorded a few days before the bodies were discovered. Police had previously said they believed the victims had been in the car for several days before being found.\nAt a briefing Thursday afternoon, McManus said police believe the video shows the driver of Guerra's Optima using something to wipe down the side of the car, but \"we can't be 100% certain of that.\" He said he did not know if the two people in the video had any connection to the victims. He said police do not believe the person seen driving the Optima was Guerra or Soto.\nPolice currently believe Guerra and Soto were killed somewhere else and then taken to the location they were eventually found, McManus said. He would not say if he believed the two were still alive at the time the video was recorded.\nMcManus said Guerra died from a gunshot wound to the head, and that the manner of death still hasn't been determined, but both his and Soto's killings are being investigated as a capital murder case. McManus said police could not fully rule out the possibility of a murder-suicide, but as of Thursday, he said they do not believe that is what happened.\nSoto's family claims there was a history of abuse Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, previously told CBS News that she believes her daughter was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\"I think it had something to do with [Guerra] and things that he was doing, not my daughter,\" Cordova said. \"My daughter just was there with him and they didn't want ... they didn't want someone to say what happened, somebody that's going to say it's so-and-so or this is what he looked like. She just was there at the wrong time.\"\nInvestigation continues into the shooting death of pregnant Texas teen 01:48 Both Soto's mother and aunt claimed the relationship between Soto and Guerra was abusive, although police have not commented on or confirmed those allegations.\n\"He used to abuse her,\" Cordova said. \"And I told her to get out of the relationship, but she — she was hard-headed, she wouldn't listen. But I think this time she was going to leave him already. That's what I'm hearing.\"\nSoto's aunt, Laura Cordova, said Guerra \"would hit [Soto] throughout her pregnancy\" and that her niece had bruises.\nGuerra's father told CBS affiliate KENS his son had a criminal history, including an assault charge involving Savanah last year.\n\"He didn't hang around the best crowd,\" Guerra's father told the station.\nBut he said the two had been doing well since moving in together and were looking forward to becoming parents.\n\"They were inseparable. Was it a perfect relationship? No, but she definitely was not a prisoner there,\" he told KENS. \"Her and Matthew were both overjoyed and couldn't wait for Fabian's arrival.\"\nLaura and Gloria Cordova also told CBS News Soto was excited to give birth, with Laura Cordova saying her niece was \"counting the days.\"\n— Kerry Breen contributed reporting.",
