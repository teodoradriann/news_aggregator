    "text": "Officers were called to the 2500 Philmont Avenue store on Dec. 4, Lower Moreland police said in a release. They arrived to find 42-year-old Armand Xhelo holding a bat and arguing with a group of people, according to officials. Witnesses told police that Xhelo had caused the accident and was now threatening others in the parking lot, authorities said. Xhelo \"immediately became combative with police,\" the release says, and he allegedly grabbed onto his car's roof rack to avoid being handcuffed. Police said he kicked at them, knocking a TASER device from one officer's hand. Authorities also said he tried to kick out the window after he was handcuffed and placed in the squad car. Xhelo, of Huntingdon Valley, was charged with aggravated assault, disarming a law enforcement officer, terroristic threats, and related counts, police said. His bail was set at $25,000 and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 12, records show. He has a second active case in Montgomery County for allegedly receiving stolen property and other charges that stem from a May incident in Rockledge Borough, according to court records. to follow Daily Voice Montgomery and receive free news updates.",

    "title": "Hundreds of homes in Scotland without power for second night as Storm Gerrit clean up under way",
    "text": "Hundreds of homes in Scotland faced a second night without power after Storm Gerrit battered the country with heavy rain, wind and snow. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. “As of 7.45am this morning, SSEN Distribution has reconnected over 45,000 customers. Work this morning is progressing to reconnect 750 of our customers still off supply,” a spokesperson said. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” As part of SSEN’s support package, customers who will be without power for more than 12 hours are entitled to £30 per person for every day without power to cover the cost of food and drink. Customers on SSEN’s Priority Service Register can also claim “reasonable” costs for alternative accommodation if it is expected they will be without power for more than 24 hours. Network Rail confirmed on Friday morning that all lines which had previously been closed following the adverse weather had now reopened, with the exception of Dumfries – Kilmarnock. The final route is expected to open later on Friday morning. Traffic Scotland said that the A82 between Invergarry and Invermoriston remains closed due to fallen trees on the carriageway on Friday. The A96 has reopened in both directions at Huntly. And six people were rescued from vehicles stuck in flood water in Banchory. Ferry operator CalMac announced a series of cancellations, delays and time changes to a number of services on Friday. Passengers are advised to check for updates on CalMac’s X account.

É fake.\"\nMinistro do Trabalho e Emprego, Luiz Marinho, criticou proposta de mudança no seguro-desemprego - Rafaela Araújo/Folhapress Na quarta-feira (23), uma nota da Secom (Secretaria de Comunicação Social) da Presidência da República também tratou como informações falsas notícias divulgadas pela imprensa a respeito das mudanças na multa do FGTS.\nA mudança no seguro-desemprego é uma das principais medidas estudadas na revisão de gastos, como revelou a Folha . Uma das propostas prevê descontar das parcelas do benefício o valor da multa sobre o FGTS.\nA avaliação é que, quanto maior o salário do trabalhador, maior tende a ser seu saldo no fundo de garantia e, consequentemente, o valor da multa —que seria abatido das parcelas, segundo a proposta.\nA medida é vista por ala do governo como uma forma de desestimular trabalhadores que \"cavam\" a própria demissão, além de manter o efeito punitivo a empresas que demitem muito.\nLINK PRESENTE: Gostou deste texto?

Además, las comunidades de Andalucía, Cataluña y Comunidad Valenciana se mantienen en alerta naranja, mientras que Baleares y Extremadura están en nivel amarillo. Las lluvias también afectarán al suroeste, Levante, Aragón, Cataluña, y al suroeste de Castilla y León, pero no se esperan o son muy poco probables en el norte de Galicia, Cantábrico, norte de la meseta Norte y Alto Ebro, aunque en el resto de las zonas no se pueden descartar. Las temperaturas máximas aumentarán en el oeste peninsular, pero sufrirán un descenso en el resto, mientras que las mínimas subirán en el suroeste y en el área cantábrica, pero no cambiarán en el resto. En la Península y Baleares predominarán vientos de componente este y serán flojos en zonas del interior. Sin embargo, serán más intensos en los litorales, y vendrán con posibles intervalos fuertes en zonas de Cádiz y Baleares. En cambio, en Canarias soplarán los vientos flojos. Además, la Aemet recomienda mantenerse informados sobre las predicciones meteorológicas y seguir las recomendaciones de Protección Civil. El tiempo este sábado Este sábado, la Aemet prevé que en la Península y Baleares se produzca una transición hacia una situación de mayor estabilidad. Sin embargo, la situación podrá seguir siendo adversa y todavía se esperan lluvias en el sur de Andalucía, Levante, medio-bajo Ebro, este de Cataluña y Baleares, sin descartar extensas zonas aledañas. Además, podrán darse chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, Castellón, Valencia y el archipiélago balear. En Canarias hay posibilidad de precipitaciones débiles, dispersas y ocasionales en las islas montañosas. En cuanto a las temperaturas, las máximas incrementarán en el oeste peninsular y las mínimas tendrán una bajada en general. Predominarán vientos flojos de componente este en la Península y Baleares y serán más intensos en litorales, con posibilidad de algún intervalo de levante fuerte en el Estrecho. En Canarias soplarán vientos variables flojos. El tiempo este domingo Este domingo, en la Península y Baleares, se espera que continúe una transición hacia una mayor estabilidad, pero todavía son probables precipitaciones en Levante, medio-bajo Ebro, litorales catalanes, Estrecho y Baleares, sin descartar otras zonas del tercio oriental. A su vez, podrá haber chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y persistentes en el entorno del Bajo Ebro. En Canarias hay posibilidad de que tengan lluvias débiles, dispersas y ocasionales en las islas montañosas. Aunque las temperaturas no experimentarán grandes cambios en general, predominarán aumentos ligeros de las máximas. Con respecto al viento, predominarán flojas rachas de viento de componente este en la Península y en el archipiélago balear. Podrán ser más intensos en litorales, con probables intervalos de fuerte en los de Estrecho y Alborán y vientos variables flojos en Canarias. *Sigue las últimas noticias sobre El tiempo y la previsión meteorológica en [RTVE.es](https://www.rtve.es/eltiempo/)",
