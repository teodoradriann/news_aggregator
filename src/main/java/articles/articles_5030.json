    "text": "Climate change DC is ahead of some sustainability goals — and not slowing down anytime soon Oana Leahu-Aluas, an analyst with the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment, is smiling, knowing D.C. is ahead of schedule in many areas. By Mark Segraves, News4 Reporter • Published 1 hour ago • Updated 1 hour ago NBC Universal, Inc. The District has more trees, more bike share options and fewer carbon emissions than it had 10 years ago.\nAlong the Anacostia River, Oana Leahu Aluas is excited to talk about the progress D.C. has made in its 20 year goal to become more environmentally sustainable.\n📺 Watch News4 now: Stream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now.\n\"We're doing well on a lot of fronts,\" said Leahu-Aluas of the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment.\nSustainable D.C. was launched 10 years ago, setting environmental goals to be reached by 2033. And Leahu-Aluas is smiling, knowing D.C. is ahead of schedule in many areas.\n\"Last year, Capitol Bikeshare had its biggest ridership in all of its history,\" Leahu-Aluas said. \"And we'll see if that gets outdone this year.\"\nAnother benchmark is the number of trees across the city.\n\"We do plant more than 10,000 trees every year,\" Leahu-Aluas said. \"And we also want to make sure that those trees are planted in the areas where they're needed most. So areas without a lot of shade currently, areas where there's extreme heat, a lot of asphalt really creating that urban heat island effect.\"\nAnd the District isn't slowing down anytime soon.\n\"We've also gotten more funding coming in to plant more trees in specifically those types of areas,\" Leahu-Aluas said.\nMaryland Dec 22, 2023 Centenarians and good Samaritans: The DC area's good news highlights from 2023 Climate change 5 hours ago Hurricane Helene brings climate change to forefront of the presidential campaign changing climate Jun 18 ‘Show Your Stripes Day' showcases changing temperature trends With clear effects of climate change in the news as the death toll after Hurricane Helene climbs, it's a reminder of how important sustainability efforts are.\n\"If you look at the climate section of our sustainable D.C. progress report, you'll see accomplishments in areas like through our flood smart homes program, how people can get assessments to learn what they would need to install to make sure their homes are more flood proof,\" Leahu-Aluas said.\nWhile most of the goals in the Sustainable D.C. plan are on track, there are some areas where the District is behind schedule, like what we do with our trash. Leahu-Aluas says that's where residents and businesses can help.\n\"We're trying to recycle or compost 80% of the waste we generate away from landfills and incinerators. And right now we're closer to 30%.\"\nLeahu-Aluas says one way people can help is by participating in programs, like the curbside compost collection program. Local farmers' markets often have compost collection sites available to visitors, with more options on the way.\n\"There soon will be sites all around the city where people can drop off their compost 24-7,\" Leahu-Aluas said. \"And businesses can certainly initiate better recycling and composting programs as well. So that's a place where people can really help.\"\nAs for the big goal for D.C. and the entire U.S., reducing carbon emissions, the District is on track to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by the year 2030, three years ahead of schedule.",

    "text": "Jaipur: Heavy rains brought a plethora of problems for commuters who faced lack of public transport, while cabs and auto drivers, taking advantage of the situation, tried to fleece them.Fares on app cabs were almost twice to thrice the normal rates, and auto drivers also started asking for hefty fares from commuters. Passengers arriving or heading towards the railway station and city airport were among the worst hit.“From city airport to Calgiri Marg, the fare on Thursday morning was showing around Rs 350 on different app cab platforms. On normal days, it hardly costs Rs 150. The worst thing was I had to wait for around 25 minutes outside the airport terminal even after agreeing to pay such an exorbitant fare,” said Amit Prasad Sanghvi, a Malviya Nagar resident, who arrived from Mumbai on Thursday morning.App cab drivers claimed mainly two reasons prompted companies to increase fares on Thursday. First, because of incessant rainfall, there were no bike services available. Second, the demand increased owing to huge traffic congestion on city roads.“On Thursday, it was taking at least 30 to 45 minutes more to drop a passenger than on normal days. This further increased the demand, and the app cab services took the opportunity to increase the fare,” said Ramchandra Meena, an app cab driver.Charanjeet Pal Singh, a student from Hanumangarh, said he had a tough time reaching his Malviya Nagar accommodation from his coaching centre on Gopalpura Bypass road. “No bikes were available on app cabs. Fares for cabs were extremely high. Even auto rickshaws were charging almost twice,” he said. We recentlyYatri Sathi AC cabs from airport to cost 70 more from today in KolkataFrom Friday, passengers booking AC Yatri Sathi cabs at Kolkata's airport would pay an additional Rs 70 per trip as parking fees are now being charged. A recent meeting between the airport authorities and involved parties prompted this change. Non-AC yellow cabs under Yatri Sathi remain unaffected by these new charges.112205479Gadkari intervenes to enable smooth cab service at rly stnPrisha Tours & Travels in Nagpur, despite securing a contract to operate cabs from Nagpur railway station, faced numerous challenges including inadequate support from authorities and competition from unauthorized operators. Despite investing significantly, the company earned only 10% of its investment and sought an extension for the contract and licence fee payment from Nitin Gadkari.112121056Cab driver returns missed bag with Rs.9.9 lakh valuables with the help of police in TirupatiA cab driver in Tirumala displayed commendable honesty by returning a bag containing Rs. 9.9 lakh worth valuables, including cash and gold jewelry, that had been forgotten by a family of devotees.

Travel is likely to be impacted.\nThe snow will begin very early Saturday, between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Several types of precipitation will continue the day, wrapping up between 10 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sunday.\nThis storm will be a big dump of snow in the mountains — 8-14 inches or more of light, powdery snow. Twenty inches or even 2 feet of snow is not out of the question in isolated spots.\nFor the foothills through portions of central Maine, sleet or freezing rain will cut into snow totals. Five to 9 inches of sloppier snow expected is expected there.\nFor the coastal plain, 3-6 inches of snow is most likely before a switch to mix and then plain rain. Along the coast, only a couple inches or so expected as it will quickly switch to rain. Things will turn very slushy as the snow changes over to rain.\nQuieter weather looks to return for Sunday with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s for the afternoon. The weather looks good for any maple festivities going on across the state.\nSuccess. Please wait for the page to reload.
