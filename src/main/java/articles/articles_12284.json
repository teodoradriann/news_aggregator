    "text": "Samsung will not soon be able to replicate Huawei’s clamshell with three screens”/>\nThe South⁤ Korean ​company Samsung, according to ​industry insiders, is preparing to release a smartphone with ⁤a flexible display that can fold in three. This ⁢innovative ‌product is expected to hit⁢ the market in⁣ 2025. However, there have been no official statements from the Samsung⁤ Mobile Experience‌ division, which is⁣ responsible for the production of foldable smartphones. This was ‍reported by GSMArena, Day.Az reports ⁤with reference to Gazeta.ru.\nAccording ​to sources, Samsung⁤ has cut orders for foldable OLED panels by 10% due to low demand for ‌the Galaxy ‌Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 smartphones. Samsung⁢ Display plans to ship 12 million foldable OLED ⁢panels this year, ‍a ‍40% decrease than last year.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 ⁣account for about 8 million displays, which⁢ is less than the original target of 10 million smartphones. The ‌decline in device sales has been observed for several⁤ years‍ now. As a possible solution to⁤ change the situation, ⁤Samsung could consider releasing a more affordable Galaxy Flip, which would make the flexible display form factor accessible to a wider ⁣audience.\nHuawei was the⁤ first to introduce a tri-fold smartphone with a⁤ continuous screen. In China, the new ⁢product was released in‌ the ⁣fall of ⁢2024⁢ under the name Huawei Mate XT.\nWhat are ‍the latest innovations introduced by Samsung in their ‌consumer ​electronics‌ lineup? Interview between Time.news Editor and Samsung⁣ Expert\nEditor: Welcome‍ to Time.news! Today, we’re diving ‍into the innovations of one of the⁤ tech giants of our time — Samsung. Joining us is ‌Dr. Emily Chen, a leading expert in consumer electronics and technology‍ trends. Thank you for ⁤being here, ⁢Dr. Chen.\nDr. Chen: Thank ⁤you for having me! I’m ​excited to discuss this fascinating industry.\nEditor: ‍Let’s ‌start​ with the recent developments at Samsung. There’s been ‍much ⁢buzz around ‍their latest products. What are some key advancements that you’re excited ‌about?\nDr. Chen: Absolutely! Samsung has been at the​ forefront of⁣ innovation, particularly with their latest devices which emphasize not‍ only cutting-edge technology but⁣ also user-centric designs. For⁢ instance, their new lineup of ⁢smartphones boasts enhanced camera systems and features powered by advanced AI. The focus on ⁣providing a seamless user ⁣experience is evident.\nEditor: That’s intriguing! AI seems​ to ‍be a ⁢game-changer in many aspects of technology today. ⁣How exactly⁢ is Samsung integrating‌ AI into their products?\nDr. Chen: Great question! Samsung utilizes AI in various forms, ‌from voice assistants capable of learning ⁣user⁣ preferences to⁣ camera systems that adapt to shooting conditions automatically. For example, their Smart‍ Camera ‌feature analyzes the scene to optimize settings, delivering stunning photographs with ‍minimal effort from the user.\nEditor: Impressive! In addition to​ smartphones, Samsung is known ​for its advancements in other categories, like displays and home‌ appliances. Can you ⁣elaborate on some ‍standout innovations ‌there?\nDr.⁤ Chen: Certainly! Samsung’s QLED display technology continues to redefine cinematic experiences⁢ at home.​ Their new Smart‍ Home ⁣appliances, integrated⁣ with⁤ IoT technology, allow for unprecedented control and energy efficiency.​ Imagine adjusting your appliances remotely via your smartphone‍ –⁣ this is not‍ just a vision; it’s ⁤a reality with Samsung.\nEditor: With ‌all these advancements, how‍ do you think Samsung stays competitive in such ‌a crowded market?\nDr.⁣ Chen: It’s about constant innovation ‍and understanding consumer ⁣needs. Samsung invests heavily in​ R&D, pushing the ‍envelope in technology ‍and design. They also excel at marketing,‍ creating products that⁢ resonate‌ with consumers ‌on an emotional level while maintaining ​a strong brand presence globally.\nEditor: All this talk about innovation and technology⁢ makes me wonder ⁤about sustainability. How‍ is Samsung addressing the growing demand for eco-friendly products?\nDr. Chen: ​Samsung is increasingly prioritizing sustainability.‌ They’ve ‍initiated programs to reduce plastic use in packaging and have committed to ⁣using more recycled materials in their products. Furthermore, their energy-efficient devices not⁢ only help reduce carbon footprints but also⁤ save consumers ‌money in the⁣ long run.\nEditor: That’s reassuring ‍to hear. As a final thought, where do you see Samsung heading in the next few years within the tech ‍landscape?\nDr. Chen: I believe⁢ Samsung will continue to lead in technology by⁤ further integrating AI and⁤ IoT across all their product ⁤lines. With the ⁣rise⁣ of the metaverse and augmented reality, I wouldn’t be surprised if they expand into developing new platforms that bridge ‍physical and ‍digital⁤ experiences. It’s an ‌exciting future!\nEditor: Thank you, Dr.‌ Chen, for ‌your⁣ insights into Samsung’s ⁤innovations and future directions. It’s clear why they ⁣remain a pivotal player ​in the‌ tech ‍industry.\nDr.⁤ Chen: My pleasure! Always happy to ⁣discuss the extraordinary world of technology.\nEditor: Thank you to our audience for joining us⁤ in this enlightening discussion.

    "text": "A nurses’ strike scheduled for Friday is on at Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women & Children after talks failed to yield a new contract.\nThe Hawaii Nurses’ Association and hospital management today held another round of negotiations in a last-ditch effort to avert the scheduled, one-day strike and subsequent lockout. There was no resolution.\nHNA OPEIU Local 50 said Friday’s strike is an “unfair labor practice” strike to protest the hospital’s retaliation for reporting unsafe staffing conditions. Kapi‘olani management has said it has a strong policy against retaliation at the hospital.\nHNA, which represents about 600 nurses, had notified Kapi‘olani on Sept. 3 that it intended to hold the one-day strike , and hospital executives responded the following day by saying they would impose a lockout to encourage the acceptance of its fair and generous offer.\n“This is a sad day for Hawaii,” said HNA President Rosalee Agas-Yuu in a news release. “Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women and Children know they are the only specialty hospital for women and children and play a crucial role in our state and the Pacific. They know children and families count on their services, yet the hospital’s leaders have chosen to lock out the nurses for advocating for safe staffing standards to improve patient care.”\nHPH has enough assets to increase nurse staffing levels, she said, but has chosen instead to spend its resources on travel nurses, who do not have the same level of experience or cultural competence as Kapi‘olani nurses.\n“We cannot remain silent and agree to a contract that skirts the core issue of patient safety,” she added. “Unfortunately, Hawaii’s patients have become innocent bystanders in this battle being waged against the nurses.”\nGidget Ruscetta, Kapiolani’s chief operating officer, has said the hospital will bring in a temporary workforce during the labor dispute, and that it will remain fully staffed.\n“We are extremely disappointed that the Hawai‘i Nurses’ Association decided to end talks early, which will lead to a strike and lockout for our nurses,” said Kapi‘olani Chief Operating Officer Gidget Ruscetta in an emailed statement. “Our Kapi‘olani negotiation team came prepared to stay as long as possible today to reach a deal that would immediately benefit our nurses. Unfortunately, after less than three hours, HNA ended negotiations for the day. We want to reassure everyone that Kapi‘olani has secured a highly skilled temporary workforce and will be fully staffed in order to provide uninterrupted care.”\nHNA has filed an injunction to stop the lockout with the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB, however, will not make a decision on the injunction before Friday, said Agas-Yuu.\nThe Kapi‘olani nurses have been without a contract since Dec. 1, and Friday will mark one year since negotiations began.",

    "text": "Influenza has been declared “prevalent” across New York state, with flu cases in New York City surging by over 70% within a single week, just as airports in the region brace for what is expected to be record-setting holiday travel.\nDr. James McDonald, New York State’s health commissioner, made the announcement on Wednesday, urging everyone aged six months and older to receive a flu vaccine. He emphasized the importance of vaccination as a critical measure to combat the spread of the illness.\nRecent health department statistics, dated through December 14, reveal a total of 23,313 confirmed flu cases spanning 60 counties since the start of the season.\nIn New York City alone, the number of lab-confirmed flu cases has seen a staggering 72% increase compared to the previous week, jumping from 2,501 to 4,300 cases. Similarly, outside the city, flu cases rose by 75%, climbing from 2,058 to 3,603 over the same period. Hospitalizations linked to the flu have also spiked significantly, with a 48% rise statewide, increasing from 270 to 399 in just one week.\nThe state’s update coincided with an announcement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials there are projecting that 13.8 million travelers will pass through the region’s airports and vehicular crossings during the year-end holiday travel period, which runs from December 21 through January 2. This includes an estimated 5.2 million passengers at JFK, Newark, LaGuardia, and Stewart airports, alongside 8.6 million vehicles using the bridges and tunnels.\nTypically, flu activity reaches its peak in January or February. For those seeking the most recent data, the state health department provides flu reports and a tracking tool online.\nWith the designation of the flu as “prevalent,” unvaccinated healthcare workers in state-regulated healthcare and residential facilities are now required to wear surgical or procedural masks, officials noted. This measure aims to curb the transmission of the virus within vulnerable populations.\nHealth officials continue to strongly recommend flu vaccinations for all individuals aged six months and older. Describing the vaccine as “a safe and effective way to protect against infection and lessen the symptoms if you get sick,” they underscored its importance in safeguarding public health.\nThose at the greatest risk of severe flu-related complications include people aged 65 and older, individuals with certain chronic medical conditions, young children, and pregnant women. Such complications can result in hospitalization or even death, making preventive measures all the more crucial.\n{Matzav.com}",

    "title": "Chamber of Commerce Sues the FTC to Stop Its Overreaching Ban on Non-Compete Agreements – RedState",
    "text": "Wednesday, a sharply divided Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to ban non-compete clauses in employment contracts. “Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once noncompetes are banned,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.” The ban affects an estimated 30 million U.S. workers who are subject to non-compete agreements, but the exact number is uncertain. A Labor Department study published in June 2022 estimated that non-compete agreements bind 18 percent of Americans, while other research suggests it could be closer to 50 percent. BACKGROUND: Federal Trade Commission Votes to Kill Employers' Ability to Use 'Non-Compete' Agreements on Employees Almost simultaneously with the FTC press release, the US Chamber of Commerce and allied business groups filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas challenging the legality of FTC action. But the chamber contends in its lawsuit that the agency lacks the authority to issue such a sweeping and consequential rule, and it is asking the court to overturn it. The chamber has opposed the rule since it was proposed 16 months ago, arguing that it would hurt businesses’ ability to protect proprietary information and reduce their incentive to invest in workers to prevent them from jumping to a rival employer. “The Commission’s astounding assertion of power breaks with centuries of state and federal law and rests on novel claims of authority by the Commission,” the lawsuit states. The Chamber is taking two distinct lines of attack against the FTC rule. First, the Chamber argues that the FTC lacks statutory authority because it involves a \" major question .\" The major questions doctrine is a principle of statutory interpretation applied in United States administrative law cases, which states that courts will presume that Congress does not delegate major political or economic issues to executive agencies. Looking at the FTC's own summary, it is hard to get around the idea that a rule that affects 30 million workers is a \"major question.\" This is the objection of the two votes on the FTC against the rule . The two dissenting commissioners in Tuesday’s vote, Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson, questioned the FTC’s authority to issue the noncompete rule. The FTC lacks “the power to nullify tens of millions of existing contracts,” Ferguson said. “The administrative state cannot legislate because Congress declines to do so,” he said. Second, the Chamber claims that the FTC rule invalidates existing contracts that may cost the employer money and leave them with no way to recoup their losses, thereby depriving them of the property interest in the agreement. For instance, if you've tied the non-compete agreement to a deferred compensation plan as a quid pro quo, you lose the non-compete, but you're still on the hook for the deferred compensation payment. I'm deeply conflicted on this subject. I am entirely on the side of employers who don't want employees walking off with intellectual property or clients. But some agreements seem more abusive than anything else. Capital has been stealing labor's lunch money the past 15 years, and, in related news, sandwich-makers at Jimmy John's sub chain now have to [sign non-compete agreements]. That's right: Jimmy John's workers have to promise not to take any of the trade secrets they learned assembling subs to any nearby sandwich shop for at least two years, [according]to Huffington Post. This is what happens when workers have zero bargaining power. Even janitors and homecare aides have been required to sign non-compete agreements. When a home care agency asks a low-wage worker to sign a noncompete, it’s usually because it doesn’t want to lose him, says William Dombi, director of the Center for Health Care Law, a public interest law firm established by the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, an industry group. “Those workers are very hard to come by,” he said. The left thinks that labor shortages mean higher wages and better working conditions for workers. It doesn't. Historically, societies have reacted to labor shortages with slavery, serfdom, and peonage. Locking a home health care aid into working for a particular company resembles how coal mines worked before the Mine Wars . There has to be some way to allow maximum mobility of labor while keeping that labor from walking off with trade secrets, pricing information, intellectual property, and customer or client lists and using them to start a business or negotiate a better deal with a competitor. Some states have taken action . Noncompete agreements have been prohibited in three states — California, North Dakota and Oklahoma — for more than a century. In recent years, 11 states and D.C. have passed laws that prohibit the agreements for hourly wage workers or those who fall below a salary threshold. Other kinds of agreements have some of the same effects as non-competes but would not be covered by the FTC rule. “The uncertainty created by these rules and the future litigation creates a risky landscape for businesses as they try to protect their most valuable trade secrets and confidential information,” said Berman, co-chair of her firm’s practice for business litigation, trade secrets and restrictive covenants, in an email. “I think we’ll see rapid movement by businesses to implement alternatives to noncompetes — such as non-solicitations agreements and deferred compensation plans — because they won’t take a gamble on protecting their proprietary information.” Maybe that is the answer. The courts need to tell the FTC to fu... I mean, get lost and leave employment contracts up to the states.",

Estados Unidos.- El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, ha restado importancia a las voces que piden que ponga fin a su campaña para la reelección en las elecciones de noviembre, mostrando confianza en su capacidad para vencer nuevamente al exmandatario Donald Trump: “Lo vencí una vez y lo haré otra vez”. En una esperada rueda de prensa, Biden señaló que no es “inusual” que haya dudas sobre su candidatura en este punto de la carrera presidencial y afirmó que todavía queda un “largo camino” por delante. La conferencia generó gran expectación, con todas las miradas puestas en el desempeño de Biden tras las dudas expresadas por miembros del Partido Demócrata sobre su capacidad para gobernar durante otros cuatro años, especialmente después del debate del 27 de junio contra [Trump ](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2024/07/12/donald-trump-busca-anular-condena-en-nueva-york-que-argumenta-su-defensa/)(2017-2021). Sin embargo, Biden no comenzó con buen pie, sufriendo un lapsus al llamar por error “Trump” a su vicepresidenta, Kamala Harris, al inicio del evento. “No habría elegido al vicepresidente Trump como vicepresidente si creyera que ella no estaba calificada para ser presidenta”, dijo, refiriéndose a una pregunta sobre si Harris estaría lista para ocupar la presidencia en caso de ser necesario. Biden también fue cuestionado sobre otro lapsus ocurrido durante un acto público, en el que se refirió al presidente ucraniano, [Volodímir Zelenski,](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2024/07/11/joe-biden-llama-por-error-presidente-putin-a-zelenski-en-la-cumbre-de-la-otan-en-washington/) como “Putin”. Visiblemente molesto, Biden minimizó el error: “¿Has visto una cumbre más exitosa? Estaba hablando de Putin y dije ‘Putin’, no, lo siento, Zelenski”. “Sé que suena demasiado egoísta, pero otros líderes, jefes de Estado, al agradecerme, dicen: La razón por la que estamos juntos es por Biden (…) Creo que fue la cumbre más exitosa a la que he asistido en mucho tiempo”, afirmó. Después del debate Durante el debate contra Trump, Biden mostró una actuación débil, hablando con voz ronca y mostrando dificultades para concluir algunas frases. La campaña había propuesto celebrar ese debate meses antes de lo habitual en campañas presidenciales con el objetivo de tranquilizar a los votantes preocupados por sus 81 años. Sin embargo, el encuentro tuvo el efecto contrario, generando dudas entre legisladores de su partido y en prestigiosos medios sobre si será capaz de aguantar o si debería dar paso a otro candidato que se enfrente a Trump en noviembre.

Biden es el presidente de mayor edad en la historia de Estados Unidos y el primer octogenario en ocupar la Casa Blanca. Si gana a Trump en las elecciones del 5 de noviembre y sirve los cuatro años de mandato, dejaría el poder con 86 años. El Partido Republicano ha argumentado que votar por Biden en noviembre significaría en realidad elegir a Harris, quien, como siguiente en la línea de sucesión, asumiría la presidencia si le ocurriera algo al mandatario.
