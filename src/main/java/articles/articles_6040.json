The State Department has reportedly also authorised voluntary departures from missions in Bahrain and Kuwait.\nThis precautionary approach led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to update the global travel advisory on Wednesday, stating, \"On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions.\"\nNote that earlier, CBS reported that U.S. officials received information indicating that Israel appears to be preparing to launch an attack soon on Iran.\nAccording to Axios, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a phone call on June 9 not to take such a step.\nIran’s defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, raised alarms on Wednesday with a warning that, in the event of a conflict following failed nuclear talks, the United States would suffer heavy losses. “America will have to leave the region because all its military bases are within our reach and we will, without any consideration, target them in the host countries,” he told reporters.\nElon Musk asks 'Is it time to create new political party?'

Nur an einem Tag gibt es Fleisch oder Fisch. Dagegen gingen die Eltern gerichtlich vor.

    "text": "Jeremiah Donati has been named the 31st Director of Athletics at the University of South Carolina, President Michael Amiridis announced on December 5, following a meeting with the Board of Trustees. Donati joined USC after serving as athletics director at Texas Christian University (TCU) since 2017. Under his leadership, TCU achieved significant success, including eight national championships, 11 Big 12 Conference titles, and the school’s first appearance in the College Football Playoffs. TCU’s men’s basketball team has reached three consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and its baseball team won back-to-back Big 12 championships and appeared in the College World Series. \"I’m honored to join the University of South Carolina, a school with a rich history of athletic excellence and passionate fans,\" said Donati. \"I look forward to working alongside our exceptional coaches, student-athletes, and staff to continue building on the tremendous success of Gamecock Athletics. Our goal is to be a national leader in both competitive excellence and student-athlete experience. We will compete for championships while ensuring our student-athletes are supported in all aspects of their college careers.\" Donati’s experience at TCU includes overseeing significant facility upgrades and enhancing the student-athlete experience, with nearly $500 million invested in athletics facilities. He also helped raise record levels of donor support for TCU athletics and led fundraising initiatives like the Tomlinson Student-Athlete Development Endowment Fund. \"I am thrilled to welcome Jeremiah Donati to Gamecock Nation,\" said USC President Michael Amiridis. \"Jeremiah's accomplishments at TCU speak for themselves. His leadership will be invaluable as we continue to build on the successes of Gamecock Athletics and ensure that our student-athletes have the support and resources they need to compete at the highest level.\" Before becoming TCU's AD, Donati held various roles at TCU, including Deputy Athletics Director, where he was instrumental in fundraising and project development. He also has experience working with Leigh Steinberg Sports & Entertainment and in fundraising for the University of Arizona, Washington State, and Cal Poly. Donati succeeds Ray Tanner, who served as USC's Athletics Director since 2012 and will become athletics director emeritus and senior advisor to the president. Donati holds a bachelor’s degree in politics and government from the University of Puget Sound and a law degree from Whittier Law School. Under Donati, TCU saw record donor support for its athletics program. In the four years he led fundraising for the Frog Club, TCU achieved its three highest totals in athletics donations. The school also set records for men's basketball attendance and reached new highs in ticket and licensing revenues. In March 2019, Donati partnered with TCU football legend LaDainian Tomlinson to create the Tomlinson Student-Athlete Development Endowment Fund, aimed at helping TCU student-athletes prepare for life and careers after graduation. Donati and his wife, Nicole, have two daughters, Colette and Naomi. The search for the new Director of Athletics started in September 2024, with help from Funk Associates executive search firm.",

    "text": "Eddie Gonzales Jr . – MessageToEagle.com – Sleep is critical for all sorts of reasons, but a team of international scientists has discovered a new incentive for getting eight hours of sleep every night: it helps the brain to store and learn a new language.\nImage credit: CDD20 / – Pixabay A study led by the University of South Australia (UniSA) and published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed that the coordination of two electrical events in the sleeping brain significantly improves our ability to remember new words and complex grammatical rules.\nIn an experiment with 35 native English-speaking adults, researchers tracked the brain activity of participants learning a miniature language called Mini Pinyin that is based on Mandarin but with similar grammatical rules to English.\nHalf of the participants learned Mini Pinyin in the morning and then returned in the evening to have their memory tested. The other half learned Mini Pinyin in the evening and then slept in the laboratory overnight while their brain activity was recorded. Researchers tested their progress in the morning.\nThose who slept performed significantly better compared to those who remained awake.\nLead researcher Dr Zachariah Cross, who did his PhD at UniSA but is now based at Northwestern University in Chicago, says sleep-based improvements were linked to the coupling of slow oscillations and sleep spindles – brainwave patterns that synchronise during NREM sleep.\n“This coupling likely reflects the transfer of learned information from the hippocampus to the cortex, enhancing long-term memory storage,” Dr Cross says.\n“Post-sleep neural activity showed unique patterns of theta oscillations associated with cognitive control and memory consolidation, suggesting a strong link between sleep-induced brainwave co-ordination and learning outcomes.”\nUniSA researcher Dr Scott Coussens says the study underscores the importance of sleep in learning complex linguistic rules.\n“By demonstrating how specific neural processes during sleep support memory consolidation, we provide a new perspective on how sleep disruption impacts language learning,” Dr Coussens says. “Sleep is not just restful; it’s an active, transformative state for the brain.”\nThe findings could also potentially inform treatments for individuals with language-related impairments, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and aphasia, who experience greater sleep disturbances than other adults.\nResearch on both animals and humans shows that slow oscillations improve neural plasticity – the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to experiences and injury.\n“From this perspective, slow oscillations could be increased via methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation to accelerate aphasia-based speech and language therapy,” Dr Cross says.\nIn future, the researchers plan to explore how sleep and wake dynamics influence the learning of other complex cognitive tasks.\n“Understanding how the brain works during sleep has implications beyond language learning. It could revolutionise how we approach education, rehabilitation, and cognitive training.”\nSource\nPaper\nWritten by Eddie Gonzales Jr. – MessageToEagle.com Staff Writer",

The Hamas leader also discussed the situation with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the two agreed to continue talks with the aim of reaching an agreement.\nHamas is a designated terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union.\nIsrael said it will only consider joining cease-fire talks if Hamas responds to the latest internationally mediated proposal for a temporary truce and release of hostages taken by the group during its Oct. 7 invasion. The conflict has been raging in Gaza for the almost seven months since, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.\nRelated Articles World News | European court upholds Italy’s right to seize prized Greek bronze from Getty Museum, rejects appeal World News | US and Saudis near defense pact meant to reshape Middle East World News | Death toll climbs to 48 from highway collapse in China World News | 4 Americans face 12 years in prison for bringing live ammo to Turks and Caicos World News | The US is building a pier off Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid.

More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in the subsequent Israeli onslaught, according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.\nEarlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to quickly reach a decision on terms for a pause in hostilities, describing the offer as “extraordinarily generous.”\nThe U.S. is seeking the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, alongside a pause that could pave the way to an end to the war.\nHaniyeh stressed “the positive spirit” in which Hamas is approaching the latest proposal, and aims to reach an agreement “in a way that achieves the demands of our people and stops the aggression against them.”\nHamas has previously called for Israeli forces to withdraw entirely from Gaza. Israel has refused to go that far, and is instead preparing to invade the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge.\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "Ce fruit de saison est un excellent allié minceur, parfait pour détoxifier le foie avant l’arrivée de l’étémis à jour le jeudi 4 avril 2024\nCertains aliments, plus que d’autres, peuvent contribuer à notre bien-être. Et ce fruit serait parfait pour détoxifier notre foie et perdre nos kilos superflus avant l’été. Découverte.\nÀ l’approche de l’été, nombreux sont ceux qui aspirent à affiner leur silhouette et à perdre du poids après les excès de l’hiver.

C’est pourquoi il est important de chercher des alternatives plus douces et naturelles pour retrouver la forme et la vitalité.\nHeureusement, certains aliments, facilement trouvables dans nos placards, peuvent nous aider à atteindre nos objectifs de bien-être et de santé. En les intégrant à notre alimentation quotidienne, nous pouvons stimuler notre métabolisme, favoriser la digestion, et même détoxifier notre organisme après les excès de la saison hivernale. C’est le cas d’un agrume particulièrement prisé en cuisine : le citron.\nLe citron est idéal pour perdre du poids et détoxifier son foie avant l’été\nEt oui ! Si vous le saviez pas, le\ncitron se révèle être le complice parfait pour celles et ceux désireux de retrouver une silhouette affinée avant l’été. Doté d’une richesse exceptionnelle en vitamine C, en antioxydants et en composés végétaux bienfaisants, cet agrume déploie une palette de vertus insoupçonnées pour notre bien-être. Le citron, par sa consommation régulière, est reconnu pour dynamiser le métabolisme. Ce phénomène favorise la combustion des graisses et participe ainsi à l’allégement de la silhouette.\nMais ce n’est pas tout ! Grâce à ses propriétés détoxifiantes, le citron agit également en profondeur. Ce dernier aide à purifier notre organisme des toxines accumulées. Son effet revitalisant contribue à éliminer les impuretés et à donner un coup de pouce à notre santé.

Commencez par boire chaque matin un verre d’eau tiède avec le jus d’un demi-citron frais. Cette première action stimule le foie dès le réveil et favorise la production de bile, élément clé de la\ndétoxification.\nEnsuite, tout au long de la journée, ajoutez quelques gouttes de jus de citron dans une tasse d’eau pour maintenir l’hydratation. Et soutenir les processus de nettoyage du foie. Vous pouvez également agrémenter vos salades, infusions ou smoothies avec des tranches de citron pour une touche de fraîcheur et d’énergie. Vous pouvez également accompagner ce fruit d’autres aliments réputés pour la perte de poids, tels que le concombre ou le gingembre.",

    "title": "¿Cuáles son los beneficios del agua de limón con piña en los riñones?",
    "text": "No solo el agua mineral natural cuenta con beneficios en los riñones, hay muchas bebidas saludables que pueden impactar de manera positiva en este par de órganos, tal como el jugo de arándanos; sin embargo, una de las opciones más populares es el agua de limón con piña.\nEl jugo de piña combinado con el limón es un ‘ganar-ganar’, debido a que ambos ingredientes son ricos en vitamina C, cuentan con algunos minerales como el magnesio, fósforo y potasio; y tienen un efecto antioxidante en el cuerpo, de acuerdo con Medical News Today y Healthline.\nY aunque es cierto que el agua de limón con piña cuenta con beneficios en la salud, hay quienes deciden beberla con el objetivo de prevenir la aparición de los cálculos renales y por las supuestas propiedades diuréticas, pero, ¿qué tan ciertas son estas bondades?\n¿Qué efecto tiene el agua de limón con piña en los riñones?\nTanto el agua de piña como el jugo de limón, forman parte de las bebidas preferidas para preservar la salud renal, ya que son deliciosas, se llevan bien con la comida corrida o hasta con unos tacos de pastor y son muy sencillas de preparar.\nEs por este motivo que hay quienes optan por combinar ambos jugos en una bebida, te contamos qué tan beneficiosos pueden llegar a ser para tus riñones.\n¿Cómo afecta el agua de piña con limón a los riñones? Tiene un efecto antiinflamatorio\nUno de los principales componentes de la piña es la bromelina y una investigación publicada en la revista científica Biotechnology Research International encontró que este compuesto tiene propiedades antiinflamatorias e incluso puede llegar a ser tan eficaz como los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos.\nA pesar de ello, Healthline explica que la investigación no está hecha directamente sobre el jugo de piña, por lo que hasta ahora se desconoce si beber el zumo tendrá el mismo efecto en el organismo y se requiere más investigación.\nMedical News Today agrega que el jugo de limón es rico en compuestos vegetales llamados flavonoides, los cuales actúan como un potente antiinflamatorio en el organismo, lo que posiblemente ayuda a combatir la inflamación crónica.\nEstos efectos son relevantes, debido a que una investigación publicada en la revista científica Elsevier asegura que la inflamación “y fibrosis son el motor de toda alteración del daño renal”, con esto coincide la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, quien explica que “la enfermedad renal crónica (ERC) se relaciona con un estado de inflamación crónica”.\n¿El agua de limón con piña es buena para los riñones? Esto pasa cuando la bebes\nUno de los beneficios de tomar jugo de piña es que algunos estudios hechos en laboratorio y animales presentados por el portal Healthline encontraron que la bromelina, presente en la piña, puede ayudar a reducir la presión arterial alta; sin embargo, se requiere más investigación.\nLos limones también tienen este efecto positivo, ya que un estudio publicado en la National Library of Medicine encontró que las mujeres japonesas que comían limones todos los días y caminaban, tenían una presión arterial más baja.\nAunque estos efectos son positivos para la prevención de enfermedades cardiacas, también tienen beneficios en la salud renal, debido a que la hipertensión también puede dañar los vasos sanguíneos presentes en los riñones, de acuerdo con los National Institutes of Health.\nCuando esto ocurre, los riñones dejan de trabajar correctamente, lo que impide que filtren los desechos de la sangre, según con la institución, quien agrega que “la presión arterial alta es una de las causas principales de insuficiencia renal“.\nAdemás de estos beneficios, Healthline explica que “la piña puede ser un dulce capricho para personas con problemas renales”, ya que esta tiene menos fósforo, potasio y sodio que las naranjas, los plátanos o los kiwis, a pesar de ello, si padeces alguna enfermedad renal, antes de beberla, te recomendamos consultar a un médico.\n¿Cómo tomar el agua de limón con piña ayuda a limpiar los riñones? Las propiedades diuréticas\nTal como sucede con los efectos del agua mineral en los riñones o los presuntos beneficios de tomar la infusión de diente de león, hay quienes consideran que beber el jugo de piña con limón cuenta con propiedades diuréticas.\nSobre este beneficio, la doctora López Marín, entrevistada por el portal Europa Press, explica que la piña ayuda a eliminar líquidos y toxinas del organismo, es decir, tiene propiedades diuréticas; sin embargo, no hay investigaciones que lo comprueben.\nIncluso, Mayo Clinic agrega que \"hay poca o ninguna evidencia científica para probar que los alimentos tienen efectos diuréticos, así que es posible que no te parezcan eficaces“.\nEl caso del limón es el mismo, ya que Medical News Today explica que no hay evidencia que demuestre que esta bebida tiene efectos diuréticos: “la mayoría de las afirmaciones sobre la capacidad de los alimentos o bebidas para limpiar o desintoxicar los órganos no tienen base científica”.\n¿El agua de limón con piña ayuda a prevenir los cálculos renales?\nLos National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explican que beber agua con limón puede ayudar a prevenir los cálculos renales; al respecto, Medical News Today explica que se debe a que esta bebida es rica en citratos.\nLos citratos, un componente también presente en la piña, impide que las sales de calcio se cristalicen y se formen los cálculos renales, también conocidos de manera coloquial como “piedras en los riñones”, explica la Facultad de Medicina de Chile.\n“Una de las alteraciones metabólicas más frecuentes en los pacientes formadores de piedras es la disminución de este compuesto en la orina, o sea, sus riñones producen poco citrato“, explica el doctor Felipe Águila para el portal de la universidad.\nAdemás de ello, beber el agua de limón con piña te ayuda a mantener buenos niveles de hidratación, cuando se toma de manera ocasional, y la National Kidney Foundation explica que “los cálculos en el riñón se forman con menos facilidad cuando hay suficiente agua para impedir que los cistales se unan unos a otros”.\n¿Cómo se prepara el agua de limón con piña para los riñones? La receta de la bebida\nPara hacer el agua de piña con limón necesitarás los siguientes ingredientes:\n- 1 taza de piña picada\n- El jugo de 4 limones\n- 1 litro de agua\nAzúcar o miel de abeja(al gusto)\nPara la preparación deberás colocar la piña, el jugo de limón y medio litro de agua en la licuadora. Si endulzarás la bebida, este es el momento para colocar el azúcar o la miel. Tras ello muele muy bien. Cuando acabes, pasa el zumo por un colador y agrega el jugo al agua restante.\n¿El agua de limón con piña tiene efectos secundarios?\nComo cualquier bebida natural, como el agua de papaya o el jugo de manzana, el agua de limón con piña cuenta con algunos efectos secundarios en la salud. Estos son los siguientes.\n- Malestar estomacal: debido a que el jugo del limón es muy ácido, este puede ocasionar acidez y reflujo en personas con\nla enfermedad por reflujo gastroesofágico, explica Medical News Today; Healthline agrega que comer mucha piña verde causa malestar estomacal, náuseas y diarrea. - Alergias: aunque la piña no es uno de los alérgenos más comunes, la bromelina puede ocasionar ardor en la lengua, picazón o náuseas, según con Healthline.\n- Úlceras en la boca: Medical News Today afirma que el jugo del limón puede provocar picazón y úlceras en la boca.",

    "text": "El Lenovo Tenerife logró su octava victoria de la temporada y se jugará sus opciones de disputar la Copa del Rey en la última jornada de la primera vuelta, al vencer este jueves en el Palacio de los Deportes de Granada por 68-80 al Covirán Granada, que pone fin a su racha de buenos resultados aunque sigue fuera de los puestos de descenso. El Lenovo Tenerife empezó mejor el partido (4-8, m.3) ante un Covirán Granada que tomó la delantera con su acierto cerca del aro (14-10, m.7) y que fue capaz de acabar por encima en el marcador el igualado primer cuarto (18-17). El acierto del serbio Dusan Ristic dio ventaja a los visitantes (23-28, m.15 tras once puntos seguidos del balcánico), renta ampliada porque a los locales les costaba un mundo anotar ante la buena defensa tinerfeña (28-38, m.18 y segundo tiempo en el cuarto pedido por Pablo Pin). El Lenovo Tenerife llegó al descanso mandando en el partido por 30-38 tras ser mejor y estar más acertado en ataque que el cuadro andaluz. La gran defensa sobre el estadounidense Joe Thomasson, la estrella local, y la buena lectura del juego en ataque con un gran Marcelinho Huertas permitió al Lenovo Tenerife ampliar aún más su renta en el tercer cuarto (35-50, m.24). El Covirán Granada reaccionó con un parcial de 10-0 (45-50, m.29), aunque los de Txus Vidorreta se repusieron levemente para entrar en el cuarto final con nueve puntos de ventaja (45-54). La buena defensa de los locales les metió del todo en el partido (57-59, m.34), con los visitantes agarrados a los puntos del estadounidense Elgin Cook para poder respirar (57-64, m.36). El Covirán Granada falló los triples que podían haber provocado un final igualado y el Lenovo Tenerife controló a la perfección los minutos definitivos y supo jugar con su ventaja guiados por un sensacional Marcelinho Huertas. -- Ficha técnica: 68 - Covirán Granada (18+12+15+23): Rousselle (4), Thomasson (10), Tomás (7), Cheatham (16), Felicio (7) -quinteto inicial- Díaz (5), Kramer (7), Martínez (2), Kairys (10), Iriarte (0). 80 - Lenovo Tenerife (17+21+16+26): Huertas (20), Salin (8), Cook (12), Doornekamp (7), Shermadini (8) -quinteto inicial- Fernández (4), Fitipaldo (2), Ristic (11), Sastre (0), Abromaitis (8).
