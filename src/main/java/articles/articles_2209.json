    "title": "Mini-Splits Vs. Wall Furnace: Why Mini-Splits Are The Energy-Efficient Solution For The Home",
    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- GetNews) As homeowners increasingly seek energy-efficient and environmentally friendly heating solutions, Temp Air Heating & Cooling highlights the growing popularity of mini-split systems as a superior alternative to traditional wall furnaces. Offering significant advantages such as zero emissions, enhanced energy efficiency, improved indoor air quality, and added safety features, mini-splits are becoming the go-to option for residential and commercial heating needs. Key Advantages of Mini-Splits Over Wall Furnaces: Zero Emissions One of the primary benefits of mini-split systems is their environmentally friendly operation. Unlike wall furnaces, which often rely on natural gas or other fossil fuels, mini-splits run entirely on electricity. This means they produce zero emissions, making them a cleaner, greener option for heating. By eliminating the combustion process, mini-splits reduce the carbon footprint of your home, contributing to a more sustainable future. Improved Energy Efficiency Mini-split systems are designed to be highly energy-efficient, utilizing inverter technology to regulate heating output based on the specific needs of the room. This allows mini-splits to maintain a consistent temperature without wasting energy, in contrast to the on-and-off cycling of traditional wall furnaces. Homeowners can see substantial savings on their energy bills while enjoying more precise temperature control in individual rooms. No Ductwork Required Mini-splits are a ductless system, making them an ideal choice for homes without existing ductwork. This not only simplifies installation but also improves energy efficiency by eliminating the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for up to 30% of heat loss in a home. Mini-splits are easy to install and maintain, providing both flexibility and efficiency. Better Indoor Air Quality Wall furnaces can introduce contaminants such as dust, allergens, and combustion byproducts into the air. Mini-splits, on the other hand, come equipped with advanced filtration systems that remove dust and allergens from the air, improving indoor air quality. The absence of combustion also means there is no risk of harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, entering the living space. Safety for Children and Families Mini-splits offer a safer heating solution for households with children. Unlike wall furnaces, which can become hot to the touch and pose burn risks, mini-splits operate without exposed heating elements or open flames. This makes them a safer option for homes with young children, providing peace of mind while maintaining comfort. Quiet Operation Unlike traditional wall furnaces, which can generate noise as they operate, mini-splits are designed for quiet performance. The outdoor condenser and indoor air handler work together to provide near-silent heating, making mini-splits ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, and other areas where peace and quiet are important. Zoned Heating Mini-split systems allow for zoned heating, meaning homeowners can control the temperature in individual rooms or areas of the home. This feature reduces energy waste by allowing occupants to heat only the spaces they are using, unlike wall furnaces that heat entire sections of a home, even if those areas are unoccupied. For homeowners looking to upgrade their heating systems, mini-split provide a modern, efficient, and eco-friendly alternative to wall furnaces. With zero emissions, increased energy efficiency, enhanced safety for children, and better indoor air quality, mini-split systems represent the future of home heating. Temp Air Heating & Cooling is proud to offer expert installation and maintenance services for mini-split systems, helping homeowners transition to this superior heating option. Whether you're looking to upgrade your current system or install a new one, Temp Air is here to help.

    "text": "King cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes. Videos of snake catchers often go viral on social media because they perform a job that most people would find terrifying. These rescuers frequently amaze us with their skill in capturing potentially dangerous serpents. Recently, a massive 12-foot-long King Cobra was rescued and released into the forest by wildlife officials in Agumbe, Karnataka. Ajay Giri, field director at the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station (ARRS), posted the rescue video on Instagram , which was later shared on X by Indian Forest Service officer Susanta Nanda. ''King Cobra in Agumbe Ghat in western ghat of South Karnataka. Rescued & released safely,'' Mr Nanda wrote on X while sharing the video. Watch the video here: King Cobra in Agumbe Ghat in western ghat of South Karnataka.\nRescued & released safely🙏 pic.twitter.com/NAQvaHnc67 According to Mr Giri's Instagram post, local villagers noticed the cobra crossing a main road, after which it took refuge in a bush within the compound of a house. The owner of the house spotted the snake and quickly alerted the forest department and ARRS officials. Mr Giri rushed to the location with his team, while instructing locals over the phone on the dos and don'ts involving the snake. After a quick inspection, the officials quickly got to work, using a rod to carefully bring the snake down from the bush. They then placed the cobra into a rescue bag and released it into the wild in the presence of the locals and forest department officials. Internet users were fascinated with the video and lauded the snake catchers for their skill and expertise. One user said, ''What a gorgeous cobra. Thank you for saving him.'' Another wrote, ''So professionally done as compared to so many videos online!!'' A third commented, ''it is so satisfying to watch him go back to his natural habitat, rescue team.'' Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com A fourth added, ''What an incredibly majesticking Cobra this is! Not only have saved him. You have probably saved about 10 snakes nearby'' A fifth said, ''Well handled. Minimum or no stress to the King. No bash display of the King to the World...a rarity after scores of SM posts gloating the same.'' According to National Geographic, King cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes. These snakes can literally \"stand up\" and look a full-grown person in the eye. The amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite is enough to kill 20 people.",

    "title": "To reduce injuries to cops and suspects, Torrance’s Gracie University brings Brazilian jiujitsu to police",
    "text": "Tucked into the corner of a business plaza only a minute’s drive from downtown Torrance, an unassuming building is headquarters for Gracie University, a martial arts academy that local to federal officers arrive to learn defensive techniques.After the severe beating of Rodney King by officers in 1991, the Los Angeles Police Department brought in Ultimate Fighting Championship co-founder Rorion Gracie as an expert consultant to teach tactics of Brazilian jiujitsu suitable for interactions with civilians in a nonviolent way, said Rener Gracie, one of Rorion’s sons and now Gracie University’s CEO.Other departments followed.“We’ve been here for 25 years doing this but it wasn’t until post-George Floyd that we saw a massive surge in terms of interest from agencies trying to get their officers better trained,” said Rener Gracie, who is in partnership with brother Ryron. “They were desperate for a solution, civilians were desperate for a solution, and jiujitsu is where they landed.”Rener, 40, is the grandson of Helio Gracie, who along with his older brother Carlos Gracie, modified and adapted the techniques of Japanese jiujitsu into a form called Brazilian jiujitsu, a grappling martial art that teaches practitioners to utilize their leverage, grip, and position to control a resistant opponent — including those who may be larger or stronger.Rorion Gracie left Brazil for for America in 1978 and began teaching classes out of his Hermosa Beach garage. As demand for classes increased, the Gracie family opened its first jiujitsu academy, in 1989, in Hermosa Beach. By the early 2000s, the demand paved the way for Gracie Survival Tactics, a specialized law-enforcement training program now based in Torrance. The course aims to create a de-escalation culture among police departments, fostering calm decision-making to reduce injuries to officers and civilians alike.(Overall, the Gracie brothers mostly teach those who just want to learn the sport. “We (Gracie University) are comprised of a global network of over 250 Certified Training Centers, all of which are operated by instructors who’ve been personally certified by my brother and I in Torrance,” Rener Gracie said. The extended Gracie family has opened up various other training facilities in Southern California that are separate entities.)“Historically, and today, it remains true in many agencies: Officers in America are disastrously under-trained,” Rener Gracie said. “It’s shocking how few hours they get. Some states have zero annual training requirements for a police officer who is interacting with the public physically on a daily basis.”Police in California are only expected to complete a minimum of four hours in the use of reasonable force per year, according to the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), although individual agencies can require more.“We don’t teach any real striking,” said Tom Chuckerel, a Gracie University instructor. “We’re very, ‘Manage the distance, manage the damage.’ If you can manage the distance between the suspect, you can manage the damage.”The course doesn’t teach neck restraints as a use-of-force option, in compliance with POST, the state agency that sets training standards for police officers. But officers do learn how to defend against neck restraints if they were to be placed in one by a suspect, said Charlie Fernandez, director of Gracie Survival Tactics.Agencies that have sent employees to Gracie University include Homeland Security, the New Jersey Police Training Commission, the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, Gracie officials said.Attendees, usually police-defense instructors from their respective departments, spend five days at Gracie University, training a total of 30 hours. The cost is $1,200, usually picked up by the department but sometimes by the officer. The cops often return to their agencies and teach the techniques to personnel there.Techniques taught in Gracie Survival Tactics factor in weapon retention and handcuffing procedures and take into account the chance an officer’s mobility is limited because of his or her uniform and equipment.Peter Hanink, an assistant professor in the Sociology Department at Cal Poly Pomona who studies interactions between police and the public, said there are no official statistics for how often police force results in a death, or how often force is used at all.“Is it better to use submission holds than bullets? Of course!” he said. “But will that make excessive force less common? That’s much less certain.”Hanink said it seems more likely that cases involving unnecessary deadly force were the result of poor judgment, such as using force longer than it was required, rather than inadequate training. Many police agencies across the country require other officers to step in and stop an officer from using excessive force, he added.Placentia Sgt. Jason Alcala took an interest in the program after seeing how effective martial arts was for his son.To the sergeant, the biggest takeaway from bringing jiujitsu fundamentals to policing is a safer environment for suspects and officers.Sgt. Alcala intended to introduce jiujitsu training to his department. He hopes to inspire other officers to train on their days off.“Using jiujitsu is a much more humane way of taking people into custody and keeping them under control,” Alcala said. “By and large, you don’t have to strike suspects, it minimizes damage to both the officer and suspect, and it’s a good conditioning tool.”",

    "text": "Keith Lee’s D.C. Reviews Spark Controversy: Restaurant Owner Shares Her Side in Exclusive Interview When ultra-popular food critic Keith Lee comes to a new city, it can be a [revitalizing moment for any restaurant ](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/arts-culture/pop-culture/2023/12/07/471718/the-puddery-keith-lee-pearland-temporarily-closes-spike-in-customers/)looking for serious exposure. His “everyman” approach to food criticism is brutally honest yet extremely personable, and that’s why he can garner millions of followers across various social media platforms. Lee is not only known for his viral video thoughts on various local restaurants but has been known to give out significant tips or pay for other patrons' food. That was witnessed again when the former mixed-martial arts fighter announced last week that he [would visit the DMV area](https://www.tiktok.com/@keith_lee125/video/7404723075721317663). Though Lee had found some respectable spots in Virginia and Maryland, Washington, D.C., disappointed him. After giving lackluster reviews to two D.C. area eateries and criticizing the city's focus on alcohol over food, he announced that only six of the 12 restaurant reviews [ he recorded would be posted online.](https://www.tiktok.com/@keith_lee125/video/7407640489001880863?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7293728976932046379) In the video, Lee highlighted health code violations at unnamed restaurants, noting that sharing the full videos would be \"not constructive\" and could harm the business owners, so he chose not to post or name them. Many were reminded of his time criticizing [Oakland’s food scene](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13950363/keith-lee-tiktok-oakland-sf-bay-area-struggles). One of the videos involved one restaurant not having running water. D.C. locals with eagle eyes noticed that the brown bar top and lime-green walls were from Omari’s Music Bar & Agave Lounge. According to owner Kia Williams, it was the ultimate case of Murphy’s Law, as the visit coincided with a day when her water was cut off due to a billing error. Someone even called the health department on her, and she was ultimately cleared following the visit. \"It was the worst experience of my life,\" Williams recalled the situation to Lee that felt like a lost opportunity. \"I really wanted him to experience my food and see what we offer. I explained to Keith Lee, I showed him the receipt. I let 'em know this was an error and it was beyond my control. It was even people coming in and I told them that I couldn't serve them and other people that were sitting and they wanted to order food. And I said, I can't serve you anything else because our water is not working.” Entrepenurialship has been a tough road for Williams over the past decade. In 2013, she was forced into opening a business after losing her job due to an injury. Williams turned her side gig of hosting events into her main source of income. Split between creating a scratch kitchen and a sauce line, she was inspired by her daughter to adopt a pescatarian diet, which further influenced her culinary direction. \"I wanted to show people that good food can be healthy, vegan, and fun,\" she said. In 2020, Williams and her business partner signed a lease for a new location for Shaleafa Kitchen, only to discover severe issues with the property, including mold and leaks, which the landlord had yet to disclose. \"We lost all our life savings,\" Williams said, expressing her frustration with the legal battles and lack of support from local authorities. Despite these setbacks, she continued to pursue her dream, opening a second restaurant, Omar's Music Bar, in 2022. \"We have been open since July 2022, but it's been a struggle to keep it running,\" she admitted. The financial strain of running two businesses and the high overhead costs in D.C. have taken a toll on her and her partners. \"We haven't paid ourselves in years, and we're constantly in debt,\" Williams shared, highlighting the challenges of sustaining a small business in the city. She also expressed her concerns about the broader issues facing small Black-owned businesses in D.C. \"It's frustrating that small places like mine don't get any light. The overhead costs are killing us, and we don't get the same opportunities as big corporations,\" she stated. She pointed out the systemic barriers that prevent small businesses from thriving, such as gentrification, high rents, and lack of financial support. Local D.C. natives around social media echoed the same sentiment, including [Ousanas B Jabulani](https://www.facebook.com/2346133/posts/pfbid02Dh48TAcpR4n2g3RTjwBsWadWLUGCVZXGzyrN6mE4f6X31oAsWfuhw5xcyRtut3zPl/?mibextid=cr9u03), who highlighted how gentrification has driven out many of the city's beloved mom-and-pop shops. He noted that [many local businesses have been \"priced out, voted out, and shut down,\"](https://dcist.com/story/23/09/11/h-street-gentrifying-anc-liquor-licenses-kitchencray/) making way for Michelin-starred restaurants and pop-ups that often leave once they've had their run. While Jabulani agreed with Lee's critiques, he emphasized that the decline in food quality is rooted in the displacement of D.C.'s vibrant cultural and culinary heritage by outside forces that \"never cared\" about the city's original character. “I think it's important to understand why the food he's seeking sucks,” Jabulani wrote on Facebook. Williams is also getting help from local D.C. food vloggers like [Big Schlim Food Reviews, who gave Omar's Music Bar rave reviews](https://www.instagram.com/big_schlims_tastetest/?hl=en). The local influencer was a fan of the food offerings, including the complimentary popcorn featuring blue organic kernels topped with local scallions and a sweet agave-infused herb sauce, Jerk Chicken Bankroll, Salmon Bankroll, Agave Fries, Strawberry Mocktail, Jeriyaki Noodles, Shaleafa’s Noodles, and Salmon Tacos. As she looks to the future, Williams is exploring new opportunities, including relocating her business outside of D.C. \"We're in court with our landlord, and we're looking for a new space, but it won't be in D.C. We've been through too much here,\" she concluded. BET.com contacted Keith Lee's team for a response, but have not heard back.",

    "text": "El destacado\nCarlos López (8)\nSeguro. Mantuvo firme Pellicer su apuesta por Carlos López y cumplió a la perfección. Muy pronto no solo será el guardameta de esta competición. Apunta a ello. No pudo hacer nada en el gol en propia de Galilea. Estuvo muy firme tanto por arriba como por abajo. Espectacular la que le saca a Oyarzabal. Gran partido.\nEl equipo\nMurillo (5)\nJugó como lateral derecho y se notó mucho que venía haciéndolo como central. A la hora de cubrir espacios hacia atrás se le vio lento. Firme en el uno contra uno, pero con espacios a la hora de subir.\nMoussa (7)\nOtro de los que sale muy reforzado del partido de Copa. Hizo muchas cosas y casi todas ellas bien. Con personalidad a la hora de sacar el balón desde atrás y también muy seguro en el cuerpo a cuerpo.\nEinar Galilea (4)\nUn rechace mal despejado acabó siendo el único tanto de la Real Sociedad. En líneas generales, bien. Sacó un gol en la línea de meta en los últimos minutos. Algo errático en la salida de balón.\nVíctor García (6)\nHizo temblar sin éxito los cimientos de La Rosaleda. ¿Si hubiera entrado ese disparo al palo? Muy cerca se quedó. Bien en ataque. Tuvo mucho trabajo atrás con los extremos de la Real, obligando a Sangalli a ayudarle.\nJuanpe (6)\nSe marcha del partido con sabor a poco porque solo una tarjeta amarilla le retiró del encuentro. Se le pudo ver en un gran momento, dando aire en todas las partes del campo.\nLuca Sangalli (7)\nQué gran noticia es tenerle de vuelta. Es el faro del Málaga CF en los mejores y en los peores momentos. Peleó con garra ante su exequipo. Actuó impecable como capitán animando a sus compañeros.\nJokin Gabilondo (7)\nEmpezó jugando más como interior, por delante de Murillo en la banda derecha. Se gustó mucho, se le vio alegre en ataque y peligroso. Acabó el partido trabajando como lateral en el barro.\nAntoñito Cordero (6)\nSe fue apagando con el paso de los minutos, pero es una nota muy reseñable. Tiró de desparpajo para hacer frente a cualquier jugador de la Real Sociedad. Muy bien peleado en defensa.\nAarón Ochoa (7)\nEl verso libre de este Málaga CF. Actuó como mediapunta y se hizo grande en todas las zonas del campo. Creó peligro entre líneas. Tendrá muchos minutos con el primer equipo.\nRoberto (7)\nLe Normand se acostará con dolor de cabeza después de pasar una noche infernal con Roberto. Fue el punto de referencia del Málaga CF. No encontró el gol, pero sirvió un nivel de trabajo de sobresaliente para abrir huecos.\nSuplentes\n- Kevin Medina (6): Tenía enfrente a un rival de Champions y lo notó con el paso de las jugadas. No brilló en su banda, se tuvo que conformar con un disparo.\n- Dioni (7): Partido magistral para enseñar en escuelas. No se puede interceder más con menos posesión. El cerebro de este equipo. Lo hizo todo bien.\n- Dani Lorenzo (6): Con el dominio de la Real Sociedad disfrutó de poco balón. Tuvo que zafarse ante futbolistas como Mikel Merino o Brais Méndez.\n- David Larrubia (6): Tuvo un zurdazo para empatar la eliminatoria. De cada 10 intentos, le hubieran entrado seguro más de 4. No tocaba.\n- Manu Molina (6): Adelantó las líneas del equipo para ‘ahogar’ a la Real Sociedad al final.",

    "text": "A freshman at Towson University studying to get a communications degree. You wouldn't know it now, but growing up Brett Burch faced an obstacle that made him silent.\nWalking around the rented three-seater plane, 19-year-old Burch is completing his safety checks. It's how he starts every one of his flights.\nCool, calm, and collected. He's ready to enter the plane and prepare for take-off.\nAs a child he dreamt of this day, but something stood in the way, \"I suffered drastically from severe stuttering,\" said Burch.\nAn obstacle that followed him through elementary, middle, and even the beginning of high school. His mom, Melody Burch, exhausted all options in hoping to tackle his speech impediment.\n\"I could see sometimes that he would just silence himself,\" said Melody. \"I would try to tell him just breath, take your time. When that wasn't working, I told him lets try speech therapy. The school even asked if I wanted an IEP.\"\nIt came down to Burch having to find his own way. With becoming a pilot in mind, he knew communication was key to being in the sky. That's when he became his own encyclopedia.\n“You just have to know multiple meanings to multiple words and be able to swap it at lightning speeds, so you don't stutter,” said Brett.\nA pattern that took practice every night,\"I just talked in front of a mirror at night, just talk, talk, talk. When I would watch a movie, I would just try to immolate the people in the movie,” Brett said.\nSomething he still does to this day, and it works. But then he faced another obstacle, the cost of flight school. But Brett was not going to let that stand in his way.\n\"He just happened to apply to the Steve and Marjorie Harvey foundation, they have a mentoring program for young black boys that come from single parent households,\" Melody said,\nNot only was Brett chosen for the program, he got a scholarship that helps pay for his flight school.\n\"I started flying in high school, it was before COVID, but then COVID happened, and I had to stop flying\" said Brett. “But after high school I picked it back up and got my private.”\nA determination his flight instructor Tony Ipina saw from the beginning.\n\"He actually excelled through the flight training more than usual,\" said Ipina.\"He took himself as a leader in the aircraft.\"\nBrett said he flies three times a week, working now to get his commercial license, but the scheduling can be hectic.\n\"As a college student, I have late classes so the only time that I can actually fly is pretty much at night,\" said Brett.\nWhile he can't rent a car, he can fly a plane. The goal is to one day fly for one of the major airlines. With one message to those who feel something may be in the way of achieving their dreams.\n\"Don't ever let anything silence you, keep working hard. You work hard, you're going to get it,” said Brett.",

    "text": "The National Park Service has leases being targeted for termination on top of the recent staff cuts, advocacy group says.Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Over 30 National Park Service leases could be canceled, advocacy group NPCA said. The NPCA said the canceling the leases could impact visitor experiences and safety. The potential lease terminations are part of the Trump administration's push for spending cuts. ADVERTISEMENT The NPCA, a nonprofit that advocates for the national parks, compiled a list of leases that have been targeted for termination by the Trump administration. If approved, the terminations would take effect at various times this year or next depending on the locations, according to the list.\n\"Whoever's making these decisions is not making them in the best interest of the park service or park visitors,\" Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA, told Business Insider. \"Sure, you could be saving some money, but at the expense of public safety.\"\nThe potential cancelations are part of the Trump administration's push for efficiency and spending cuts across the federal government, which has included mass firings as well as lease terminations by various agencies.\nADVERTISEMENT Park advocates and employees have already expressed concern about staffing cuts — around 1,000 NPS employees were believed to have been fired last month while an additional 700-plus opted into the deferred resignation program, according to an internal NPS memo viewed by BI. They said the staff cuts would make the parks less safe and less enjoyable for visitors. NPCA said canceling these leases would have a similar effect.\n\"The Department of the Interior and its bureaus are committed to upholding federal responsibilities to communities and tribes,\" a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which includes NPS, told BI, adding that the department is working with the General Services Administration, or GSA, \"to ensure facilities or alternative options will be available for the continued delivery of Interior services as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management.\"\nThe GSA, which sent a memo to various agencies last month requesting lease terminations, did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\nSo what could that mean for travelers headed to National Parks for their vacations? The facilities being targeted include at least eight visitor centers, including some that have no apparent alternative location, Brengel said. The visitors centers on the list include the Fairbanks Alaska Public Lands Information Center, the visitor center for Little River Canyon National Preserve in Alabama, the visitor center for the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in Minnesota, and the visitor center for the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in Seattle.\nADVERTISEMENT Brengel said visitor centers are the first stop for many park-goers, who rely on park rangers at those centers to get information on what to do or see, park history, and how to stay safe while exploring, as well as any trail closures or potentially dangerous weather conditions.\nOther facilities that NPCA found could have their leases terminated include those used for law enforcement or search and rescue, or SAR. One facility in Utah is located centrally to several national parks and houses staff and equipment, including some used to address wildfires and for SAR. NPCA said it's currently unclear where these resources would be relocated if the lease was terminated.\nThe list also includes facilities focused on science, like water quality testing, and that house delicate artifacts that require specific conditions to be safely stored, like the Southeast Archeological Center in in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe potential impacts are compounded by the staffing cuts, which advocates and park service employees said could lead to overflowing trash cans and poorly maintained bathrooms and other facilities, as well as long entrance lines to enter parks or closed off areas.\nSome park service employees are making the case that the leases are necessary and are appealing to the GSA for exceptions, Brengel said. It's unclear when the appeals would be granted or when the final termination orders would be issued.\nADVERTISEMENT Brengel said it seems like these only reason these particular leases were targeted was because they were considered \"soft-term,\" meaning they were in a period of their contract in which they could more easily be terminated.\nIf the superintendents of the parks had been consulted in advance of proposing cuts, she said, they would have found NPS has been \"underfunded and understaffed for 15 years.\"\nHave a tip?
