    "title": "Putin builds on Prigozhin's foundations in Africa",
    "text": "On August 21, 2023, two days before he died when his jet crashed, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who hadn't been heard from since his aborted rebellion against the Kremlin two months earlier, posted a video on social media. \"All is well. I'm in Africa. We're recruiting real heroes and continue to carry out the tasks that have been set,\" said the head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, seen stony-faced, standing in a desert landscape. Dressed in fatigues and a bulletproof vest and holding an automatic weapon, Prigozhin called on volunteers to join Wagner to \"make Africa more free.\" The message also seemed to be addressed to his former ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, as if to signal to the man who now called him a \"traitor\" that his disrepute stopped at Russia's borders. In Africa, his military, commercial and media empire, built up since 2017 in four countries – Sudan in the east, Libya in the north, Mali in the west and the Central African Republic – was firmly entrenched. Little did he know that this trip to Africa would be his last. The Kremlin waited just two days after Prigozhin's funeral to claim ownership of his most valuable legacy. On August 31, 2023, a military aircraft took off from Moscow bound for the African continent. On board were Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov and General Andrei Averianov, a commander in the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Both men had been commissioned by Putin. The Wagner method: How Russia crept into Africa The instructions they had been given took past mistakes into account. \"In order not to lose operational control over an armed formation (...), the Russian authorities decided to clearly separate structurally the business, propaganda and military components of the former 'Prigozhin empire,'\" wrote researchers Filip Bryjka and Jedrzej Czerep, co-authors of a report on Russia's African strategy at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. Under the Russian Ministry of Defense's aegis, three intelligence services were tasked with recovering and developing Wagner's various branches: the GRU for the paramilitary, the FSB security services for the propaganda network, and the SVR exterior intelligence service for cultural influence. Burkina Faso was high on the Kremlin's agenda. On August 31, Yevkurov and Averianov landed at Ouagadougou airport. At the presidential palace, Captain Ibrahim Traoré, a coup leader in power since September 2022, was waiting for them. The two delegations held an amiable meeting in one of the VIP lounges. Saving private \"IB\" – as he is known in Burkina Faso – had become crucial. This African ally pushed to the fore by Moscow at the Russia-Africa summit held in Saint Petersburg at the end of July 2023 was in a tight spot. He had narrowly escaped several coup attempts. Yevkurov and Averianov proposed to the captain an offer consisting of deploying Russian paramilitaries to protect him, while assuring him of the support of propagandists who would be tasked with selling his popularity.

    "text": "The revolutionary achievement in treating cancer patients with first indigenous CAR T Cell therapy NexCAR19, has been dedicated to the nation by the Hon'ble President of India Droupadi Murmu while addressing at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) on Thursday.\nThe Hon&apos;ble Governor of Maharashtra Ramesh Bais, who was the guest of honour was present along with the IIT Bombay Director Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri, Director of Tata Memorial Centre Professor Sudeep Gupta, and the key contributors led by Professor Rahul Purwar, Department of Bioscience and Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Dr. Hasmukh Jain and Dr. (Surg Cdr) Gaurav Narula from the Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai. Moreover a few cancer survivors who were successfully treated with the CAR-T cell therapy were also present.\nIIT Bombay and Tata Memorial Centre&apos;s Indigenous CAR T-Cell Therapy\nIn his address, Institute&apos;s Director Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri presented an overview of the Institute&apos;s research work and ecosystem and its growth over the years, with a focus on the contributions by Prof. Rahul Purwar, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, who developed this therapy along with his team at IIT Bombay, at the startup ImmunoACT which he cofounded with his students, and with doctors at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.\nNavi Mumbai: Cancer treatment with proton therapy at ACTREC Kharghar soon Prof. Chaudhuri said that the low-cost CAR T-cell therapy, is a huge achievement for our country and for cancer patients in India, and it places India firmly on the global map of cell and gene therapy. He said that we can take pride in the fact that India is now one of the very few countries in the world that can make its own gene therapy for treating cancer. This is a testament to the efforts of several scientists, doctors, nurses and others who worked together relentlessly over the last decade to achieve this goal for our patients\".\n712 Students From IIT Bombay Yet To Get Placed, Placement Season To End In May Director of Tata Memorial Centre Dr. Sudeep Gupta said, \"The collaboration between IIT (B) and Tata Memorial Centre to develop the first indigenous CAR T Cell Therapy product has been extremely fruitful and satisfying. This CAR-T Cell Therapy product will save many lives at much lower cost compared to the cost of such products available outside India. We hope that in years to come, our collaboration will lead to the development of other Cell and Gene Therapy products that will help our patients with various cancers\".\nPresident Congratulates Team Of IIT Bombay\nThe Hon&apos;ble President of India Smt. Draupadi Murmu congratulated the team of IIT Bombay, Tata Memorial Centre and ImmunoACT for their efforts in making CAR-T therapy available to people. In her address, Hon&apos;ble President Smt. Murmu said.\n\"CAR-T cell therapy is considered to be one of the most phenomenal advances in medical science. It has been available in the developed nations for some time, but it is extremely costly, and beyond the reach of most patients around the world. What is new about the therapy being launched today, as I understand it, is that it costs 90 percent less than what is available elsewhere. This is the world&apos;s most affordable CAR-T cell therapy. Moreover, it is also an example of the &apos;Make in India&apos; initiative; a shining example of the &apos;Atmanirbhar Bharat&apos;,\" said President Murmu.\nGuv Ramesh Bais Congratulates IIT Bombay\nGovernor of Maharashtra Ramesh Bais also congratulated the team of IIT Bombay, TMC and ImmunoACT for the dedication of India&apos;s first indigenous Gene Therapy (named CAR-T cell therapy) to fight against Cancer, to the nation.\nBais said, \"In any advanced country, academia-industry collaboration is the key cornerstone. Academia leads in R&D, especially in basic sciences. These R&D provide potential breakthrough applications which need to be translated for commercialization by the industry. The collaboration between the academic institutes of IIT Bombay, Tata Memorial Hospital with industry partners like SINE, Laurus and others is a sterling example on how this can be achieved with benefits to all parties concerned\".\nMumbai: CAR T Cell Therapy Innovative Immunotherapy A Game Changer For Treating Cancer Advancing Healthcare In Viksit Bharat: Ramesh Bias\nViksit Bharat will also need to entail that our healthcare services are at par with the best in the world. Healthcare itself will go through a major transformation in the coming decades with new breakthrough innovations. Cell and gene therapy will be an important aspect of it from treating cancers, to genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia and many other challenges that come with ageing population.\nNot only do we have to ensure that we are able to innovate and provide the best technology to our population but also do it in a way where all segments of the society can access it\", he added.",

After opening fire on Farhan Qamar, 20, the youngest of four siblings, the intruder held the entire family hostage at gunpoint for nearly 40 minutes, preventing them from going near the fatally injured youth. According to the slain man's father, Ul Qamar:\n\"My son was struggling for his life, bleeding profusely from the bullet wounds, but his murderer, Muhammad Zubair, did not allow us to even give him some water, let alone comfort him. He repeatedly called us 'Jews' as he cursed and waved his weapon at us. We all watched helplessly, pleading with him to leave, but he wouldn't go.... Finally, before Muhammad left the murder scene, he] pointed the gun towards my wife and ordered her to unlock the main gate. He sat on his motorcycle that was parked outside, fired three shots in the air with his pistol, and shouted, 'Allahu Akbar ['Allah is greatest'] two-three times before speeding away.\"\nOnce Muhammad left, the family gathered around their blood-soaked son and brother and started crying for help, but \"None of our neighbors intervened even after they heard the first three shots fired on Farhan by Zubair.\" Farhan died on the way to the hospital.",

    "title": "No Christmas in Bethlehem, Breakthrough in Vatican, and Himalayan Declaration – The Island",
    "text": "by Rajan Philips\nIn Bethlehem where it all began, there is no Christmas this year. Bethlehem is located in Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine. Palestinian churches have reportedly cancelled Christmas celebrations and some of them have set up nativity scenes showing the symbolic Baby Jesus lying in a manger of rubble destruction. Death and destruction now define life in Gaza less than 100 km to the west, but Palestinians on the West Bank are also subject to unchecked attacks by illegal Jewish settlers and retaliation by the Israeli army against Palestinian protests.\nIt is all Christmas in the US but in a climate of national political confusion in spite of a robustly performing economy. The confusion about the war in Israel, not to mention the one in Ukraine; the hysteria over antisemitism, with the US Congress declaring opposition to Zionism as antisemitism; the for and against moves centered on Donald Trump; and competing expectations and forebodings for the great election year of 2024.\nThere will be little Christmas time in Washington for the Biden Administration, which is literally on the horns of its own dilemma of simultaneously supporting and restraining the Israeli government’s devastation of Gaza.\nAt the last UN General Assembly vote on October 12 when 153 countries called for a ‘humanitarian ceasefire,’ 20 countries abstained, and the US voted against the resolution along with Israel and eight other minions. But the US encouraged its allies (e.g., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, three of the Five Eyes along with the US and the UK) to take up a united position and support the resolution.\nAt the time of writing (Thursday evening, New York / Friday morning, Colombo), the US is finally trying to give support to a UN Security Council resolution calling for “suspension of hostilities” and “scaled-up humanitarian aid access to Gaza.” Unlike the General Assembly resolutions, Security Council resolutions have legal teeth.\nThe Security Council vote has been delayed several times at the US’s asking to find acceptable wording to support it and not veto it. If the resolution passes, that would be the first in the current crisis. With Hamas insisting that there will be no more release of hostages until Israel completely stops its attacks on Gaza, the US and its Middle East allies are looking for alternative avenues to bring about a ceasefire, howsoever it might be called.\nAs Canadian academic and international relations expert Janice Stein observed after the UN General Assembly vote, the US has “significant influence over what comes next … Starting in 1956 the United States has frequently forced Israel both to stop the fighting, accept the ceasefire and at times to pull back.” So, this will not be the first time that the US might use its influence to bring about a ceasefire.\nHow soon the US will be able to do it this time is the question. Otherwise, there is no immediate end in sight to this conflict even well into the New Year. With Yemen’s Houthis emboldened to attack merchandise ships in the Red Sea, the whole conflict may take a different turn. The other conflict in Ukraine has entered a stalemate favourable to Russia, with fatigue setting in among Ukraine’s sponsors about continuing their material support of the war.\nBreakthrough in Vatican\nLost in the din of war is what otherwise would have been an excellent Christmas gift and news. Last Monday, a week before Christmas, Pope Francis, the Jesuit Pope, issued a landmark authorization for priests to administer blessings on same-sex couples but outside the Church’s regular mass or formal rituals. This is a reversal of the Church’s 2021 declaration disallowing such blessings in keeping with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The change is considered as providing a “simple blessing” and not the sacrament of (heterosexual) marriage. Yet, it is a huge step for the Vatican.\nThe change will have its supporters and decriers, and more so in the US than anywhere else. American Jesuit Father James Martin who works among LGBT communities, has welcomed the change as “a major step forward in the church’s ministry” to them. Many same sex-couples are delighted. The conservatives in the Church are obviously opposed to it. Ulrich L. Lehner, a US theology professor, reflecting his nation’s penchant for culture wars, has called it “an invitation to schism”.\nThe Vatican breakthrough comes two months after the conclusion of the historic synod that Pope Francis had convened to guide the future of the Catholic Church. For the first time in its history the Church convened an official gathering of 364 members that included non-clerical members of the Church including 54 women. The Pope called for the meeting in 2021 as part of his efforts to reform the church and to bring the superstructure of the Church into alignment with the base of its faithful followers. Preparations over two years included consultations among Catholics around the world. Women’s role in the Church emerged as a central question with almost universal call for opening up opportunities for women to take on decision-making roles in the Church.\nAfter nearly a month of deliberations the Synod issued a Synthesis Report of 41 pages with each paragraph voted separately and receiving over two-thirds majority. The synod process and experience were based on listening and formulating positions rather than receiving top down resolutions. The report covered all the current challenges facing the Church including clerical sexual abuse, women’s roles in the church, outreach to poor and the concept of “synodality” itself.\nThe report noted that throughout the synod process, “many women expressed deep gratitude for the work of priests and bishops. They also spoke of a Church that wounds. Clericalism, a chauvinist mentality and inappropriate expressions of authority continue to scar the face of the Church and damage its communion.” “A profound spiritual conversion is needed as the foundation for any effective structural change,” it said. “Sexual abuse and the abuse of power and authority continue to cry out for justice, healing and reconciliation.” The same issues will be in focus again when the synod reconvenes in October 2024.\nA Himalayan Declaration\nSri Lanka has its problems, a continuation of the economic crisis that began last year, and unprecedented in its own historical parallels. Yet it is fortunate enough to be where it is unlike many of the other world’s troubled spots. And all of a sudden the country received a shot in the arm, so to speak, aimed at addressing its most chronic problem involving the political relationship among its communities. The shot came literally entitled as the Himalayan Declaration, and it became public after it was formally presented by its authors to President Wickremesinghe. More presentations to other notables are reported to be in the offing. But what difference the declaration is going to make is too early to tell.\nThe grand sounding name Himalayan Declaration is apparently derived from the small town of Nagarkot in Nepal, where the signatories to the declaration gathered and reached their six-point agreement as the basis for yet another initiative to resolve Sri Lanka’s national question. After the experiences of Thimphu, Oslo, and numerous other gatherings and consultations in many parts of the world including many cities in India, one can only wish heavenly blessings for the latest initiative coming down from the Himalayas to finally succeed. Most of us can only wish and watch, but the success of the initiative will ultimately depend on who among Sri Lanka’s current political actors will take over the initiative and cross the finish line.\nThe signatories to the new initiative portray an interesting coalescence comprising all Buddhist Priests from among the Sinhalese, and all Tamil expatriates living in western countries seemingly acting on behalf of the Tamils.\nOne would think the involvement of the Buddhist Priests, all of whom appear to be at the higher echelons of the Sangha hierarchy is intended to maximize the declaration’s purchase among the Sinhalese. Conversely, if their presence in the declaration can dampen the usual rabble rousing against such initiatives, that in itself would be a significant contribution.\nThe expatriate Tamil signatories to the declaration and others who worked on it are not household political names in Sri Lanka or among the Sri Lankan diasporas. But they have been in the business of ethnic politics for all their adult lives, and their intervention at this stage deserves due commendation. Unlike the interlopers who used to pop up during the Rajapaksa and Sirisena years, the present group is obviously not looking for handouts from the government. But that is not going to save them from brickbats that will be flung at them from their far flung compatriots, which seem to have already started.\nThere is never going to be unanimity among the Tamils on any proposal(s) for reconciliation. That is not in their collective DNA. But if there is substantial support among the Sinhalese for a significant initiative that is also championed by the government in power, then the collective Tamil response will be equally positive. Otherwise, even if the Tamils are unanimous in their support for an initiative it will not go anywhere without sufficient purchase among the Sinhalese. One shortcoming of the initiative is the absence of Muslim and Indian Tamil participants and signatories. Obviously, it could not have been an intended omission, but in ethnic relationships inadvertent omissions can be as damaging as deliberate ones.",
