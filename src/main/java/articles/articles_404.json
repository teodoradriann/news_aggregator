    "text": "Church of England General Synod\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has warned against division within the Church of England, as he described “expressions of hatred” in correspondence sent to his London home.\nMr Welby said such expressions were “normally coming from within the church”, and gave another example of someone who had been working on a project for the church and had feared opening their emails “because of the bitterness and abuse” they faced.\nIn his presidential address to the General Synod as it opened on Friday, he said the fear and suffering which arise from division can make people see each other as enemies, something he said must be resisted.\nAt Lambeth (Palace), the brilliant member of staff who deals with the endless correspondence that comes in, is worn down by the expressions of hatred, normally coming from within the church\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\nHe said: “Causes of fear, which leads to a sense of enmity, are well-disguised as uncertainty, unpredictability and uncontrollability of life and, like barnacles on the hull of a ship, they attach themselves to make us see other people as our enemies, and that is the devil’s work.\n“Enemies make us afraid. Fear makes us suffer.\n“Someone the Archbishop of York and I met recently from outside the church said that while they were working on a project for the church, they grew to fear opening their emails, because of the bitterness and abuse they were subject to.\n“At Lambeth (Palace), the brilliant member of staff who deals with the endless correspondence that comes in, is worn down by the expressions of hatred, normally coming from within the church.”\nLambeth Palace is the London home of the Archbishop of Canterbury, his family and two religious communities, and is also described as the centre of his ministry, worship and hospitality.\nAs Lord Cameron said recently, when he looks around at the world today as foreign secretary, all the lights are flashing red\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\nThe church has been divided on issues such as blessings for same-sex couples, which were approved at Synod, the church’s parliament, last year, but are still strongly opposed by many church members.\nMore recently it has faced scrutiny from politicians over the conversions of asylum seekers to Christianity.\nThe case of Clapham alkali attack suspect Abdul Ezedi, believed to have been supported in his UK asylum claim by someone from a Baptist church rather than the Church of England, prompted debate on the overall issue of the involvement of faith leaders in conversions and asylum applications.\nThe Church of England has repeatedly said it is the “duty of the Home Office, not the churches, to make decisions on asylum applications”, but has said it is considering an update on its 2017 guidance document for clergy on supporting asylum seekers.\nElsewhere in his speech Mr Welby spoke of the suffering raging across the world, with the war in Ukraine “frozen”, and the “havoc and horror” being experienced in the Middle East, as well as devastation in places including Myanmar, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and poverty in the UK.\nHe said: “As Lord Cameron said recently, when he looks around at the world today as foreign secretary, all the lights are flashing red.\n“We live in a world of suffering and, unlike in the past, it is a world where we are aware of the suffering.”\nRegister now for one of the Evening Standard’s newsletters.

    "text": "Manitoba Court orders shared parenting plan in high-conflict case involving family violence The decision comes after the mother refused to move the children back to Winnipeg as recommended\nBy Angelica Dino 13 Jun 2024 Share The Manitoba Court of King's Bench resolved a high-conflict parenting dispute involving two young boys exposed to family violence by mandating a shared parenting plan following the mother's refusal to move the children back to Winnipeg.\nThe issue in M.I.M. v. B.S.D. , 2024 MBKB 80 involves a family conflict exacerbated by the mother’s unilateral relocation of the children an hour from the father’s home. Both parents accused each other of domestic violence during and after their relationship, with both providing evidence of physical and verbal altercations. The father presented a narrative of the mother’s violent behaviour, supported by digital evidence, while the mother claimed that the father had been physically and verbally abusive.\nThe family evaluator, Elaine Garrett, concluded that the best interests of the children would be met by a shared parenting schedule, provided the parents lived closer to each other. Garrett’s assessment found that the current arrangement, involving lengthy travel, was not optimal for the children. She recommended that the mother move closer to Winnipeg to facilitate the shared parenting schedule. Alternatively, if the mother refuses, the children should live primarily with the father.\nMost Read Husband's transfer of matrimonial home to wife fraudulent: Ontario Court of Appeal BC Supreme Court awards damages in ICBC privacy breach class action How to spot ChatGPT output masquerading as legal analysis During the trial, both parents testified extensively about their troubled relationship and their respective parenting abilities. The father emphasized his desire for a stable, conflict-free environment for the children, while the mother highlighted the positive impact of the relocation on the children's social lives.\nThe Court of King’s Bench noted the need to minimize the children's exposure to ongoing parental conflict. The judge highlighted that both parents exhibited coercive and controlling behaviour, with the mother particularly noted for her threats and attempts to manipulate the father. The court also acknowledged the father's efforts to avoid conflict and the stepmother’s role in maintaining a peaceful environment.\nThe court recognized the children's Indigenous heritage, as they have Metis heritage on their mother's side and Nigerian heritage on their father's side. The parents were encouraged to incorporate the children's cultural backgrounds into their upbringing.\nIn terms of decision-making, the court granted the father final decision-making authority on major issues if the parents could not agree. The court ordered both parents to attend counselling and parenting programs to address family violence and improve their co-parenting skills. Ultimately, the court’s decision prioritized the best interests of the children.\nRelated stories NS Supreme Court refuses to give parenting time to mother who tried to poison her son N.L.

    "text": "( MENAFN - Daily News Egypt) The South African government has warned its citizens that they could face prosecution at home if they join the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) to fight in Gaza, where President Cyril Ramaphosa has accused Israel of committing“genocide” against the Palestinians.\nThe foreign ministry said it was“gravely concerned” by reports that some South Africans have joined or are planning to join the IDF in the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n“Such action could potentially violate international law and amount to further international crimes, making them liable for prosecution in South Africa,” the ministry said.\nThe ministry said that South Africans need prior government approval to legally fight in Israel. It also said that naturalised citizens risk losing their South African nationality if they engage in a war that the country“does not support or agree with”.\nSouth Africa has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often comparing it to its own struggle against apartheid. It has strongly condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza, which have killed more than 10,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has also recalled all its diplomats from Israel. On Monday, Ramaphosa denounced the“genocidal onslaught and slaughter of the people of Palestine” at a press conference with pro-Palestinian groups in Johannesburg.\nMENAFN28122023000153011029ID1107666107\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "Heiwa (TSE:6412) Has Announced A Dividend Of ¥40.00",
    "text": "Heiwa Corporation (TSE:6412) has announced that it will pay a dividend of ¥40.00 per share on the 10th of December. The dividend yield will be 3.9% based on this payment which is still above the industry average.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nHeiwa's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Heiwa's dividend was only 60% of earnings, however it was paying out 131% of free cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n See our latest analysis for Heiwa\nHeiwa Has A Solid Track Record\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 10 years. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Heiwa has seen earnings per share falling at 3.8% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.\nIn Summary\nIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Heiwa's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

    "text": "PUBLICIDAD\nEste 9 de enero, el país perdió a uno de sus más grandes científicos. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo. Su muerte ha conmocionado al país y ha generado una ola de reacciones de instituciones y figuras públicas que destacan su legado.\nEn primera instancia, la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, donde Patarroyo fue docente del Departamento de Patología, recordó algunos de los premios más importantes que recibió a lo largo de su vida, entre ellos el Premio Leon Bernard de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica, el Premio Nacional de Ciencias Alejandro Ángel Escobar, y el Doctorado Honoris Causa de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia. \"Resaltamos y agradecemos su aporte a la ciencia y la salud de nuestro país\", destacó la universidad.\nLeer:\n[¡Pilas! La Dian informó que ahora el RUT tiene vigencia indefinida, no se vence](https://www.elnuevodia.com.co/nuevodia/colombia/524407-pilas-la-dian-informo-que-ahora-el-rut-tiene-vigencia-indefinida-no-se-vence)\nEl Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación también se sumó al homenaje a Patarroyo, calificándolo como \"una figura destacada de la ciencia en Colombia\". En su mensaje, el ministerio reconoció la importancia de su trabajo y la dedicación que marcó avances significativos en la investigación y la academia.\nAsimismo, Alejandro Gómez, exsecretario de Salud de Bogotá, rindió homenaje a Patarroyo, señalando que fue \"inspiración de varias generaciones\". En su cuenta de X, Gómez destacó que, aunque su trabajo generó debates, su rol protagónico en la ciencia colombiana nunca debe ser olvidado. Cabe recordar, que Patarroyo estuvo en el foco de la polémica por experimentar con monos nocturnos, sin tener los permisos requeridos de investigación.\nLeer:\n[Por 'exponer' a su esposa en redes, suboficial de la Policía del Meta enfrenta cargos](https://www.elnuevodia.com.co/nuevodia/colombia/524386-por-exponer-su-esposa-en-redes-suboficial-de-la-policia-del-meta-enfrenta-cargos)\nJosé Manuel Restrepo, rector de la Universidad EIA y exministro de Hacienda, expresó su tristeza por la partida de Patarroyo. \"Hoy Colombia pierde a un grande de la ciencia\", comentó, agregando que \"el profesor me enseñó mucho, y siempre le estaré agradecido por su amistad\".\nEsta redacción envía un sentido mensaje de condolencias a sus dolientes.

    "title": "Comunidad de Informática UACh celebró 43 años de vida",
    "text": "Su 43° aniversario cumplió la Escuela de Ingeniería Civil en Informática de la Universidad Austral de Chile y este nuevo año de vida fue celebrado con diversas actividades en que participó la comunidad académica, estudiantil y funcionarios.\nComo ya es tradición, la primera actividad fue el “tortazo”, un encuentro de camaradería en que se apagan las velas de una torta en el frontis del edificio 10.000 que alberga al Instituto y Escuela de Informática UACh.\nEste año, sin embargo, el momento más significativo de las actividades aniversario fue el acto de reconocimiento al ex académico Luis Álvarez González quien se acogió a jubilación tras cumplir 41 años de servicios.\nEl profesor Luis Álvarez es Ingeniero Civil Electricista y Magíster en Ingeniería Informática. Ingresó al Instituto de Informática el 01 de marzo de 1983 y entre las diversas responsabilidades asumidas a lo largo de su carrera académica fue director de ese instituto entre los años 2000 y 2012, periodo en que con tesón y perseverancia lideró el proceso que permitió la construcción del edificio 10.000, que fue inaugurado el año 2010.\nPor este motivo, el Instituto de Informática, dirigido en la actualidad por Eliana Scheihing, preparó un simbólico acto de reconocimiento que incluyó la instalación de una placa recordatoria en el acceso al edificio 10.000 en honor al profesor Luis Alvarez.\nLa actividad contó con la participación de miembros de los tres estamentos de la comunidad de informática, instancia que permitió que algunos de sus integrantes recordaran anécdotas y momentos vividos junto al Prof. Álvarez, destacando su compromiso y perseverancia para sacar adelante el proyecto de construcción del edificio que hoy acoge a alrededor de 400 personas.\nEl académico compartió también algunos recuerdos de los inicios de la carrera e instituto que en sus primeros años funcionó en el Campus Isla Teja hasta que un incendio ocurrido en 1996 destruyó el espacio que ocupaban y motivó el traslado al Campus Miraflores.\nEn sus primeros años en este campus, recuerda el profesor Álvarez, ocuparon las dependencias del edificio 400, un recinto de material ligero que no soportaba la carga eléctrica de los equipos de los laboratorios. Las condiciones del recinto hacían urgente contar con un edificio acorde a los requerimientos y crecimiento de la comunidad estudiantil. Por lo anterior señaló “creo que hice simplemente lo que me correspondía hacer en ese momento, por el cargo que ocupaba”.\nHistoria y desafíos de Informática UACh\nEn noviembre de 1981 por Decreto de Rectoría N° 438 de la Universidad Austral de Chile nace el Instituto de Informática y Métodos Cuantitativos y la Escuela de Ingeniería Civil en Informática, ambas unidades dependían de la Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Administrativas. Posteriormente, el 25 de febrero de 1994 ambas unidades se adscriben a la Facultad de Ciencias de la Ingeniería.\nLa creación de esta carrera en la UACh representó un enorme desafío puesto que en los inicios de los 80, la informática aún no se consideraba una disciplina autónoma. Fue entonces que un grupo de profesores visionarios de distintas especialidades comenzó a definir lo que sería esta nueva disciplina, la que fue creciendo con el aporte de los mismos estudiantes que se convertirían en los primeros informáticos del sur de Chile.\nAsí lo relata el Director de Escuela Jorge Maturana, quien precisa que “el primer gran desafío fue justamente crear la carrera”. En la actualidad la vigencia de la informática como disciplina, y la constante demanda del mercado de profesionales que se desempeñan en áreas cada vez más diversas plantea otros múltiples desafíos, entre ellos está el aumento de la matrícula.\nEl año 2024 los matriculados en la carrera superaron los 100 estudiantes en primer año, mientras que en años anteriores no sobrepasaba los 80.\nEl acelerado avance tecnológico además implica “hacerse cargo de la rápida evolución de la disciplina, incorporando nuevas metodologías y tecnologías que son requeridas en el mercado, sin olvidar los conocimientos fundamentales que sirven de base a la informática como ciencia. Otros desafíos lo constituyen la incorporación de más estudiantes mujeres a la carrera, esto en circunstancias que en algún momento de la historia incluso hubo generaciones en las cuales las mujeres eran mayoría” añade Jorge Maturana.\nLa comunidad informática es activa y fraternal, está conformada por cerca de 400 personas entre estudiantes, académicos y funcionarios y acorde a las exigencias de los tiempos actuales, el trabajo interdisciplinario es lo que ha marcado los cambios en esta profesión. “Estudiantes de informática colaboran en proyectos de las más diversas disciplinas, incluyendo otras áreas de la ingeniería, tales como mecánica, acústica o electrónica, así como también en proyectos relacionados con medicina o pedagogía” concluye el director de escuela.",
