    "text": "Woman grateful for Valley City volunteers after deadly tornado\nVALLEY CITY, N.D. (Valley News Live) - For weeks, volunteers in Valley City have been helping homeowners literally pick up the pieces following last month’s tornado.\n“It kind of knocked me out. That’s when I crawled to the basement,” said Homeowner DeDe Hejtmanek as she described the moment the tornado caused glass to break and push her onto the floor the night of June 20th.\n“The crazy thing is when I got up and got my dogs in the one room, I came outside and was like ‘Oh my gosh, it really was a tornado.’”\nThursday morning, dozens of volunteers made their way to Hejtmanek’s, including Valley City Teacher Matt Nielson.\n“Coaches are asking them to come, but no one’s forcing them to come. So just to see how many kids care about our community, that’s more important than anything you’re going to learn in a book.”\nA summer day, some students say, is well spent, including 8th-grader Taylor Spanier: “Instead of lying in bed or sitting at home, being here and helping is worth my time.”\nHailley Grenz, a Senior, agreed: “You can be doing so much more. We could be doing other things right now, but we’re out here and everything, and I’d rather be out here and helping out. Yeah.”\nHejtmanek moved out to the area three years ago and now has to start over.\n“It’s a total loss. It’s destroyed, yeah. Because all of the windows broke out, so the tornado just went through the whole house and everything.”\nPicking up the literal pieces of what was once a well-kept yard,\n“It’s like, where do you even start? Honestly, it’s just so overwhelming. There’s no possible way I could do it myself. It would take me months. So yeah, it’s very helpful. Super helpful. I couldn’t have done it without any of them.\n“It’s wonderful. It makes me want to cry. People really show up when you need them.”\nFor volunteers, it’s her reactions that make them realize the impact they’re making.\n“Everybody that we’ve helped out has been so gracious. It helps all of us feel really good about what we’re doing. I don’t know how many thousands of hours that our school volunteers have put in, but it’s absolutely amazing,” added Nielson.\n“It’s gone. But it’s just a house, you know?” said Hejtmanek.\nHejtmanek shared photos of her yard after volunteers were done for the day on Thursday.\nShe says her animals, including pigs, chickens, cats, and dogs, did make it out of the storm. She’s unsure of what the future holds, including whether she’ll rebuild on the property.\nAs for volunteering, Organizer Josh Johnson says they were able to hit four of the five families hardest hit in the area.\n“That’s a wrap! We were able to help 4 of the 5 families in our community that were hardest hit by the tornado. Super proud of our students, school, and community.”\nRelated Coverage:\nCopyright 2025 KVLY.

Ограничения мобильного интернета возможны на некоторых территориях Новосибирской области, предупредил замруководителя администрации губернатора и правительства региона Сергей Нешумов.\n\"В целях обеспечения безопасности жителей и объектов инфраструктуры на некоторых территориях Новосибирской области возможны ограничения предоставления услуг мобильного интернета операторами связи. При этом голосовая связь, sms-сообщения и проводной интернет будут работать в штатном режиме\", - цитирует Нешумова антитеррористическая комиссия региона.\nОтмечается, что специалистами министерства цифрового развития и связи региона подготовлены рекомендации для находящихся в зоне замедления или отключения мобильного интернета. В частности, жителям Новосибирской области рекомендуется заранее позаботиться о доступе к документам и важной информации в бумажном виде или в мобильном устройстве, а не только в облаке. Например, скачать или распечатать электронные билеты на поезд, самолет, концерты, бронь на гостиницы, офлайн-карты, маршруты поездок, сделать скриншоты нужной информации из интернета и сохранить в телефон расписание автобусов, график работы заведений.",

    "text": "The Future of Stress: Beyond “Adrenal Fatigue” and Towards Personalized Resilience Nearly half of Americans report feeling stressed “a lot” of the day, according to a recent Gallup poll. But the conversation around stress is shifting. While online searches for “high cortisol levels” and “adrenal fatigue” continue to surge, experts are increasingly focused on the nuanced interplay between our bodies, our environments, and our individual responses to pressure. The future of stress management isn’t about eliminating stress – an impossible feat – but about building personalized resilience and understanding the long-term implications of chronic activation of the stress response.\nDebunking “Adrenal Fatigue” and the Reality of Chronic Cortisol The term “adrenal fatigue” – the idea that the adrenal glands become exhausted from prolonged stress – has gained traction in wellness circles. However, mainstream medical science largely dismisses it as a scientifically unsupported diagnosis. As the source material highlights, true adrenal insufficiency, like Addison’s disease, is rare. The real concern isn’t a failing of the adrenal glands themselves, but the sustained overproduction of cortisol in response to ongoing, unmanaged stressors. This prolonged exposure can disrupt sleep, exacerbate anxiety and depression, contribute to digestive issues, and even impact cognitive function.\n“We’re seeing a growing recognition that it’s not about the hormone itself being ‘bad,’ but about the duration of its elevation,” explains Dr. Emily Carter, a neuroendocrinologist specializing in stress response. “The body is remarkably adaptable, but constant activation of the stress response system eventually takes a toll.”\nThe Rise of Personalized Stress Management One key trend shaping the future of stress management is a move towards personalization. Generic advice – “just relax!” – is often ineffective. Instead, we’re seeing a growing emphasis on understanding individual stress profiles. This involves considering factors like genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and even gut microbiome composition.\nCortisol , while often vilified, is a vital hormone. The future lies in learning to modulate its release, not eliminate it.\nSeveral emerging technologies are facilitating this personalization:\nWearable Sensors: Beyond tracking heart rate and sleep, advanced wearables are now capable of monitoring cortisol levels through sweat or saliva, providing real-time data on stress responses. Genetic Testing: Companies are offering genetic tests that can identify predispositions to certain stress-related vulnerabilities, allowing for targeted interventions. AI-Powered Stress Tracking Apps: Apps are leveraging machine learning to analyze user data – including sleep patterns, activity levels, and even social media usage – to identify stress triggers and recommend personalized coping strategies. Did you know? Research suggests that individuals with a specific variation in the NR3C1 gene (which codes for the glucocorticoid receptor) may be more sensitive to the effects of cortisol, requiring more proactive stress management techniques.\nBeyond Traditional Techniques: Novel Approaches to Resilience While established stress-reduction techniques like meditation and exercise remain crucial, the future holds exciting new possibilities:\nVagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) The vagus nerve plays a key role in regulating the nervous system and reducing inflammation. Non-invasive VNS devices are gaining popularity as a way to promote relaxation and improve emotional regulation. Early studies suggest VNS can help lower cortisol levels and reduce anxiety symptoms.\nMicrobiome-Gut-Brain Axis Interventions The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a critical player in stress response. A healthy gut microbiome can help regulate cortisol levels and improve mood. Future interventions may involve personalized probiotic formulations or dietary changes designed to optimize gut health.\nVirtual Reality (VR) Therapy VR is being used to create immersive environments that promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. VR therapy can simulate calming natural settings or provide exposure therapy for specific phobias, helping individuals develop coping mechanisms in a safe and controlled environment.\nExpert Insight: “The gut-brain connection is a game-changer in our understanding of stress,” says Dr. Sarah Chen, a gastroenterologist specializing in the microbiome. “What we eat directly impacts our brain function and our ability to cope with stress. Focusing on a diverse, plant-rich diet is a powerful tool for building resilience.”\nThe Corporate Stress Landscape: Proactive Prevention The workplace remains a major source of stress for many individuals. However, forward-thinking companies are beginning to prioritize employee well-being as a strategic imperative. This includes:\nMental Health Benefits: Expanding access to mental health services, including therapy and counseling. Stress Management Training: Offering workshops and programs on mindfulness, resilience, and emotional intelligence. Flexible Work Arrangements: Providing employees with greater control over their work schedules and locations. Biometric Monitoring Programs: (With appropriate privacy safeguards) Utilizing wearable sensors to track employee stress levels and identify potential burnout risks. Key Takeaway: Investing in employee well-being isn’t just the right thing to do; it’s good for business. Reduced stress leads to increased productivity, improved morale, and lower healthcare costs.\nFrequently Asked Questions Q: Is cortisol always bad?\nA: No, cortisol is essential for life. It helps regulate metabolism, sleep, and inflammation, and provides energy during times of stress. The problem arises when cortisol levels are chronically elevated.\nQ: What are the symptoms of chronic stress?\nA: Symptoms can include anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, digestive problems, difficulty concentrating, and increased susceptibility to illness.\nQ: Can I self-treat high cortisol levels?\nA: It’s generally not recommended to self-treat. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your stress and develop a personalized treatment plan.\nQ: What is the role of diet in managing stress?\nA: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help regulate cortisol levels and improve overall well-being. Avoid excessive sugar, caffeine, and processed foods.\nThe future of stress management is about moving beyond simplistic solutions and embracing a holistic, personalized approach. By understanding the complex interplay between our biology, our environment, and our individual responses to pressure, we can build resilience and thrive in an increasingly demanding world. What steps will you take today to prioritize your well-being and manage your stress effectively?\nExplore more insights on hormonal balance and mental health in our comprehensive guide.",
