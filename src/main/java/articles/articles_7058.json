    "title": "‘If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble’: Bethlehem set for forlorn Christmas",
    "text": "Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images\nAt Bethlehem’s Lutheran Evangelical church, the nativity scene looks very different this Christmas. Instead of a cot in a hay-filled manger, the baby doll has been wrapped in the famous black and white keffiyeh associated with Palestine, and lies among broken breeze blocks and paving slabs.\nChristmas celebrations have been cancelled across the Holy Land this year as the region mourns the Palestinians – now more than 20,000, according to Hamas – killed in the Gaza Strip. Munther Isaac, the pastor of the Lutheran church, said he wanted to send the world a message with this year’s nativity scene. “This is the reality of Christmas for Palestinian children,” he said. “If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble of Gaza.”\nBethlehem, 10 miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, is one of the most important centres of Christianity; the Church of the Nativity, today shared by several sects, was built by Emperor Justinian 1,500 years ago above the grotto where it is believed Christ was born.\nToday, the majority of Bethlehem’s population is Muslim but the town is still home to a thriving Christian community and many Christian orders, and the area relies heavily on the tourism and pilgrimage sector. Around 70% of the Bethlehem economy depends on international visitors, said the mayor, Hana Haniyeh.\n“This period is usually very active. We get 1.5 – 2 million visitors a year, but now we have zero,” he said. “Israel has made it very difficult to get here through the checkpoints and our economy has crashed, but we could not celebrate anyway. We are in mourning for the people of Gaza.”\nSince the occupied Palestinian territories do not have an airport, most international visitors enter through Israel, crossing checkpoints in its West Bank barrier wall that keeps the two holy cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem separate from one another, despite the fact that they’re only six miles (10km) apart.\nManger Square in the heart of Bethlehem, outside the Church of the Nativity, is usually thronged with tourists in December. There are festive lights, a giant Christmas tree, and the town’s alleyways and restaurants are filled with music. This year though, Manger Square is grey and empty. No one the Observer spoke to in Bethlehem on Friday could recall a time that there was no traditional tree. Outside the Bethlehem Peace Center, a banner said in Arabic and English: “Stop the genocide, stop the displacement, lift the blockade”.\nThe busy December programme includes hosting international delegations and performances from artists and singers before the festivities culminate with a parade and midnight mass on Christmas Eve. But attendance is expected to be so low this year that the Franciscan order that assigns tickets and deals with security for the event has scrapped the usual protocols; instead, the prayer service will be open to anyone who can make it.\nWeathering the pandemic was a challenge, but last year Bethlehem’s 5,000 hotel rooms were once again fully booked over Christmas, and were set to do good business again in 2023 before the war broke out.\n“I would get 50 tour groups a month in my shop. All the hotels were reserved again this year and we expected it to be great but that dream was shattered because of the conflict. Everyone cancelled,” said Nabil Giacaman, a third-generation woodworker, and owner of the Il Bambino arts and sculpture shop. His was the only shop open on Friday; he said he had come by just to keep himself busy.\n“I have 12 employees but I don’t think I can pay them at the end of the month,” he said. “We desperately need the tourists.”\nMillions of pilgrims usually visit every year, but very few Christians live in the Holy Land. A century ago, they made up a quarter of Jerusalem’s population but now represent less than 2%. The community struggles to afford housing, and the West Bank security wall has isolated them from their brethren in Jerusalem.\nToday there are just 182,000 Christians in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and 1,300 in Gaza, according to US state department estimates. When the Islamist group Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007, 3,000 Christians were registered as living there. In the besieged territory, the already tiny Christian community has been decimated by the new war, sparked by the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas that killed 1,140 people.\nThe Catholic Holy Family church in Gaza City has become a makeshift shelter but has been repeatedly hit by Israeli airstrikes. Last week, the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had placed the church under siege, and snipers shot and killed two Christian women, a mother and daughter, who had ventured outside for food and water. Pope Francis condemned the attack, which the IDF denied knowledge of.\nThe Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran, has said she worries that her family members and the other 300 people trapped at the church will not survive until Christmas.\nIn Jerusalem, too, Christmas festivities were cancelled by heads of the major churches. The ancient passageways of the Old City, normally full of tourists and pilgrims throughout the year, have been quiet since October. Most shops and restaurants are closed, with business owners saying they are too scared to come to work.\nIsraeli settlers in the Old City – like the rest of East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1980 – have used the chaos of the war to their advantage. There have been attempts by Israeli developers to seize land in the Armenian quarter that belongs to both the church and individual Armenian Christians; members of the 800-strong community are now camping out 24 hours a day on sites they believe are under threat.\nBoth the Muslim and Christian presence in the Old City and its surroundings were steadily being eroded anyway, owing to efforts by settlers as well as the Israeli government. Over the last few years, the state has accelerated its campaign to demolish increasing numbers of Palestinian homes on the grounds they lack building permits, and displace the community with development projects.\nChristian leaders in Israel and Palestine have been refraining from entering politics or current affairs, but the outpouring of grief and condemnation of the war from the patriarchates this year shows the depth of the anger many of the churches feel.\n“We are sad at seeing all the victims, especially women and children, and we are sad that the international community hasn’t taken serious action to end the massacre, as they did when Russia invaded Ukraine,” said Father Rami Askarieh, the parish priest of Bethlehem’s St Catherine’s church.\n“We pray each day for Gaza and for the victims of the war on both sides,” he said. “Israelis, Palestinians; we are all human, we are all the children of God.”",

    "title": "Alderney Unveils 2024 Nature and Agriculture Strategy: A Vision for Sustainability and Community Engagement",
    "text": "In the quaint island community of Alderney, an inspiring initiative is on the horizon as the local government unveils the 2024 draft Nature and Agriculture Strategy. This forward-thinking plan sets out to harmonize the island's agricultural productivity with the preservation of its natural landscapes, ensuring a sustainable future for both its residents and the environment. At the heart of this strategy lies an invitation to the islanders: a call to actively participate in shaping the future of their home through a comprehensive public consultation process that kicked off today, February 16, 2024.\nA Vision for Sustainability and Self-Sufficiency\nThe 2024 draft strategy is not just a document; it's a vision. It aims to reinvigorate the island's relationship with its land by focusing on sustainable food production and encouraging residents to embrace the concept of growing their own fruits and vegetables. This initiative is designed to nurture a culture of self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship among the community, ensuring that the natural beauty and biodiversity of Alderney are preserved for generations to come. The strategy's emphasis on citizen science further empowers the locals, inviting them to contribute to the island's environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.\nEngaging the Community\nThe heart of this strategy's success lies in its community engagement. Recognizing the importance of public input, the General Services Committee (GSC) has organized a drop-in session at the Island Hall, providing a platform for residents to voice their opinions, ask questions, and offer suggestions. This inclusive approach ensures that the final strategy will reflect the collective aspirations and concerns of the Alderney community. The feedback collected during this four-week consultation period will be meticulously reviewed by the GSC before the strategy is presented to the full States of Alderney meeting in May.\nA Blueprint for the Future\nThis proactive approach by the Alderney government, combining agricultural innovation with environmental conservation, serves as a blueprint for small communities worldwide. The 2024 Nature and Agriculture Strategy acknowledges the vital role that local ecosystems play in our daily lives and the importance of sustainable practices in securing a prosperous future. By placing the community at the heart of its environmental and agricultural policies, Alderney is not just planning for the next year but is laying the groundwork for a sustainable legacy.\nAs the consultation period progresses, the residents of Alderney have a unique opportunity to contribute to a strategy that balances the nurturing of their island's natural resources with the enhancement of agricultural productivity. This initiative is a testament to the power of community involvement in shaping a sustainable future, ensuring that Alderney remains a beacon of environmental stewardship and agricultural innovation. The outcomes of this consultation and the subsequent decisions by the States of Alderney in May will determine the trajectory of the island's environmental and agricultural policies for years to come, setting a precedent for how small communities can effectively manage and protect their natural heritage while fostering economic resilience.",

Put another way, they make performance apparel for people who don’t mind going for a hike on a day they already went for a run. In recent years, as Vuori’s added a stable of ambassadors, the brand’s made inroads into activities like yoga, tennis, strength training and surfing.\nThis is all great for Kudla and the folks at Vuori — but it also means that their shop is bigger than ever, and potentially a bit confusing for consumers. Fortunately for you, I’ve been doing yeoman’s work over here at IH HQ, sampling five of Vuori’s best workout shorts. That’s them right up there, hanging from the laundry rack in my kitchen.\nNotice, also, my preference for blue hues and subtle tones, even though Vuori shorts come in a variety of colors and patterns. Put together, these shorts basically constitute a brand-new workout wardrobe for me, and have made my exercising life more comfortable and functional in the process. Below, I discuss the benefits of every short, along with the workout I believe each is best suited for.\nRunning\nI put down about 20 miles a week, almost all of them in the morning, and I tend to finish my runs near the grocery store or coffee shop, so I can pick up supplies. That means I have a credit card on me as I run — and at the very least, I carry my keys, so I can get back into my apartment. Suffice to say I like pockets, and the Qualify Run Short has a few convenient options, including a perfect stash pocket above the butt. (Minimal jangling.) Plus: in an era of 5″ and 7″ inseams, I love the compromise on 6″ — [you can see where it hits my leg here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBeFTpCxkT-/?img_index=1); I’m third from the right, back row.\nFinally, and most importantly, the lining in these shorts is crazy comfortable. Vuori calls it a “boxer brief liner,” which tracks. I hate when lined running shorts invoke the constricted feeling of contact sports: compression shorts, jockstrap, the whole nine yards. Running should feel fluid and functional, especially if you do it everyday. That starts with choosing the right shoe, but wearing the right shorts is a close second.\nStrength Training\nI’d consider this pair Vuori’s answer to those popular [Ten Thousand shorts](https://www.insidehook.com/style/the-15-new-activewear-brands-every-guy-should-know) that you see everywhere. The inseam feels appropriate for a workout class or gym floor (at 6.5″) and the fabric is a mix of recycled polyester and elastane. Some people online have complained that the quality is off, citing pilling on the pant and fraying on the drawstrings, but I’ve yet to notice any cons after several washes. (For what it’s worth, I wash my workout clothes as delicates and then air-dry them.)\nWhether or not the shorts can handle the laundry room, are they worth that top-market price? One of the Domain’s biggest pros is, again, Vuori’s boxer brief liner. I haven’t traditionally hit the gym with lined workout shorts, but lately [I’ve been doing more HIIT and circuit classes](https://www.insidehook.com/fitness/athletic-clubs-aussie-squad-training-nyc). HYROX stuff. And when you’re jumping on boxes, doing side planks, pulling on the SkiErg and knocking out 25 burpees in a minute, it’s nice to have a pair of shorts that don’t chafe or ride up on the waist.\nYoga\nWhile yoga isn’t my favorite exercise on this list — in fact, it’s my perennial “I gotta make more time for that” activity — the Elevate Kore Shorts are my definitive favorite from this sampling of Vuori workout shorts. This beefed-up iteration of the brand’s internet-darling Kore Shorts (more on them in a second) is worthy of the hefty price tag.\nCompared to the Domain short, the weave on these is a little thicker, the inseam a little longer and the fit a little more relaxed, which is why I rate them for yoga, Pilates or whatever stretching routine you (hopefully) cobble together on a weekly basis. They just feel right when you’re rolling around on a mat. And no surprises here: these shorts once again feature a liner. It’s breathable, yet keeps the bits and bobs secure. Lastly, while I haven’t doled out style points yet, I’m a fan of the understated Vuori crest on this pair.\nSports\nThis is Vuori’s famous short, the one that launched a thousand Instagram ads. It’s as good as the plaudits say, and I’ve happily worked out in a previous pair of Kore Shorts for years. Ironically, if you wanted to go back to that time where adult men only owned one pair of shorts, this one could do a pretty great job. Vuori offers it in three inseam (5″, 7″ and 9″), six sizes (XS-XXL) and 16 different colors.\nBut Vuori makes better shorts for specific activities, as I’ve already established, and besides, I don’t love running in these. The back pocket features Velcro instead of a zipper, while the side pockets are traditional plunge pockets. I recommend using the pair in an all-day activity sense. They’re a good option for games: hoops, soccer, racquet sports (those side pockets come in handy for tennis or pickleball). I’d also recommend the Kore Short for casual Zone 2 activities, like cycling around town.\nHiking\nThis is an interesting short from Vuori; it’s sort of like a dressed-up board short. It can pass for linen shorts at a distance (the style above is literally called Sky Grey Linen Texture), but is actually made of a polyester blend, and dries quickly in a pinch.\nDepending on where you live — I’m based in New York — these might be a little out-of-season right now, as we march towards winter. The Banks Short is ideally leveraged for an entire day outside. I don’t want to fall prey to the swimming hole cliches (how many people are actually hunting swimming holes?), but it’s true, these would be great for a hike with a side of swimming holes. Or a coastal walk. Or less sexy: a walk to and from Trader Joe’s. The lack of liner works well here; the short feels more wellness than fitness, if that makes sense. It comes in two inseam options and a plethora of colors.\nWe've put in the work researching, reviewing and rounding up all the shirts, jackets, shoes and accessories you'll need this season, whether it's for yourself or for gifting purposes.

    "text": "Downpours have been hitting northern Kyushu and the Chugoku region in western Japan, triggering landslide and flooding alerts. They are also disrupting the operation of the Shinkansen bullet trains that run between Tokyo and Hakata in Fukuoka. The Japan Meteorological Agency says rain clouds have been developing mainly in western Japan due to exceptionally warm and damp air for the season flowing into a front and a low pressure system. Bands of rainclouds covered Nagasaki Prefecture before dawn on Saturday, and violent rain hit. The rain also intensified in the Chugoku region. A part of Shunan City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, saw rainfall of 35.5 millimeters in the hour through 9 a.m. In Imari City, Saga Prefecture, 296.5 millimeters of rain was recorded in the 24 hours through 9 a.m., more than double the normal precipitation for November. Weather officials say a total of 127 observation points in the Kyushu, Chugoku and Kinki regions recorded their largest-ever 24-hour rainfall for November. Landslide warnings have been issued for some areas in Fukuoka, Shimane and Hiroshima prefectures. Some rivers in Kumamoto, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures currently exceed flood danger levels. Weather officials say intense rain may continue to affect northern Kyushu and the Chugoku region on Saturday. They also say the front is expected to move to eastern Japan later in the day, possibly bringing heavy rain in wide areas in western and eastern Japan. The officials are calling for caution against mudslides, flooding in low-lying areas, as well as swollen and overflowing rivers. They are also warning against lightning strikes, hail and gusts, including tornadoes. Weather officials are calling on people to avoid driving on non-elevated roads along rivers during heavy rain as the risk of flooding is especially high there. West Japan Railway Company and Central Japan Railway Company say they had temporarily suspended Shinkansen bullet train operation between Tokyo and Hakata stations due to heavy rain and that operations of some trains remain disrupted.",

    "text": "T-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30\nNovember 7, 2024 - American Hockey League (AHL)Springfield Thunderbirds News Release\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. - The Springfield Thunderbirds are proud to announce that, for a second straight year, the club will wear specialty purple jerseys on Saturday, Nov. 30, at 4:05 p.m. against the Hartford Wolf Pack for the annual Hockey Fights Cancer game.\nIn addition to the return of the specialty jerseys, the team will continue its commitment to Bitsy's Army, a charitable cause established in 2021 by Thunderbirds forward Sam Bitten. Bitten tragically lost his cousin Martin Piche that year to a cancerous brain tumor at age 31, and ever since the Bitten family has been raising money and awareness for brain cancer research in their native Canada.\n\"With Sam Bitten back under contract with the Thunderbirds for two more seasons, it made too much sense as an organization to continue supporting a cause so close to the Bitten family's hearts,\" said Thunderbirds President Nathan Costa. \"We have no doubt our amazing fans will stand behind Sam in this endeavor, and we hope to top last year's donation totals in the name of finding the cure.\"\nLast season, following an inspiring 7-0 T-Birds win on Hockey Fights Cancer Night, which featured two goals by Will Bitten and the first AHL point of Sam Bitten's career, the T-Birds raised $26,000 toward cancer research via the postgame jersey auction. Portions of the proceeds were donated to the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, Bitsy's Army, and various cancer charities local to Springfield.\n\"Our family is so grateful to the entire Thunderbirds organization and the fans for the unbelievable support of Hockey Fights Cancer and Bitsy's Army over the years,\" said Sam Bitten. \"Maintaining Martin's legacy is deeply meaningful to us, and we hope his story can continue inspiring others who are going through the fight.\"\nFans attending the Hockey Fights Cancer game will also have the opportunity to purchase Hockey Fights Cancer and Bitsy's Army merchandise, the proceeds of which will also directly benefit brain cancer research.\nTickets for Hockey Fights Cancer can be purchased by calling the T-Birds at (413) 739-4625 or by visiting www.SpringfieldThunderbirds.com.\nSpringfield Thunderbirds Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the American Hockey League message board...\nAmerican Hockey League Stories from November 7, 2024\nT-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30- Springfield ThunderbirdsFive Goals by Griffins Secure Win over Iowa- Grand Rapids GriffinsWranglers Lead Battle of Alberta Series- Calgary WranglersGrand Rapids Scores Final Three Goals in 5-2 Iowa Loss- Iowa WildDelicious New Deals for Belleville Sens Fans Coming on Pizza Hut Fridays- Belleville SenatorsCapitals Loan Mike Sgarbossa to Hershey- Hershey BearsPanthers Assign Justin Sourdif to Charlotte- Charlotte CheckersWolf Pack Weekend Preview: November 7th, 2024- Hartford Wolf PackSilver Knights Sign Defenseman Lucas Johansen- Henderson Silver KnightsT-Birds Sign F Matt Luff to AHL Contract- Springfield ThunderbirdsBid Now on Hockey Fights Cancer Player-Used Sticks- Rockford IceHogsStars Reassign Goaltender Ben Kraws to Idaho- Texas StarsTransaction: Sawyer Boulton Recalled from Reading- Lehigh Valley PhantomsMonsters Sign Defenseman Grant Gabriele to Pro Tryout Contract- Cleveland MonstersMoose Unveil 25th Season Celebration Jersey- Manitoba MooseSchool Day Game, Military Appreciation Night Upcoming for Griffins- Grand Rapids GriffinsAnnual Hockey Fights Cancer Night Set for Saturday, November 16 against Laval- Rochester AmericansHartford Wolf Pack Community Foundation Opens Grant Application Process, Announces Numerous Changes to Board- Hartford Wolf PackReign Score Early, Double up Abbotsford- Ontario ReignCanucks Fall 8-4 against the Ontario Reign to Conclude Their Roadtrip- Abbotsford CanucksThree-Goal Second Period Leads Firebirds to Victory over Eagles- Coachella Valley FirebirdsFirebirds Rally for 3-2 Victory over Colorado- Colorado EaglesCondors Shutout by Calgary- Bakersfield Condors\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.\nOther Recent Springfield Thunderbirds Stories\nT-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30T-Birds Sign F Matt Luff to AHL ContractPeca Leads T-Birds' Comeback Triumph over IslesT-Birds, Springfield City Library to Expand Boomer's Reading Club for 2024-25 SeasonPhantoms Escape Ferocious Thunderdome with Triumph",
