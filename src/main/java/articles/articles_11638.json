Picture: FREDDY MAVUNDA\nEskom on Friday celebrated reaching 100 consecutive days without load-shedding, saying this signals a marked improvement in its generation and financial performance.\nThe last time the country enjoyed a prolonged period without load-shedding was from September 8 to December 11 2020.\nThis comes with a decrease in the use of open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) to supplement generation capacity. OCGTs are used to help meet high electricity demand during peak times.\n“The 100 days milestone includes around a R6.2bn reduction in OCGT diesel expenditure from April 1 to June 30 2024, compared to the same period last year. If we maintain our trajectory on reduced diesel spend, it will be a strong driver in a possible return to profit in [the 2025 financial year],” said Eskom CEO Dan Marokane.\n“Considering the intensity and levels of load-shedding in 2023, the ability to get to 100 days without load-shedding is significant, while acknowledging the risk of load-shedding continues to exist.”\nBheki Nxumalo, group executive for generation, said: “The achievement of 100 continuous days without load-shedding is the outcome of diligent execution of recovery plans and the tireless efforts of our 40,000 dedicated and skilled Eskom employees.\n“If we maintain a 70% energy availability factor (EAF) and add significant capacity within the country, we can ensure adequate available capacity to meet demand without a significant risk of load-shedding.”\nThe EAF has increased from 54.56% at the end of the 2023/24 financial year to a year-to-date achievement of 61.50%, an increase of 6.94% over the past three months.\nEskom said the reprieve was due to its generation operational recovery plan, initiated in March 2023, and aggressive planned maintenance, both made possible by financial support from the National Treasury debt relief scheme.\n“Our immediate focus remains on implementing the generation operational recovery plan, aiming to recover about 1,600MW from the generation coal fleet after the successful commercial operation of Kusile unit 5 and 930MW from Koeberg unit 2 before the end of the calendar year. This will significantly improve the EAF by the end of March 2025.”\nTimesLIVE",

    "text": "Scottie Scheffler Bravely Includes Ravioli on Masters Dinner Menu Despite Hand Injury\nAs is customary for the defending champion, 2024 Masters winner Scottie Scheffler has compiled a delicious-looking menu for the 2025 Masters dinner—and he included one dish that might make avid Scheffler heads chuckle.\nAmong the menu's many tasty bites, which include some of the same dishes from when he hosted the meal in 2023 (firecracker shrimp, cheeseburger sliders, and a chocolate chip cookie skillet, for example), Scheffler added three new foods to the mix: Texas-style chili, \"Papa Scheff's\" meatballs, and, quite fittingly, ravioli bites.\nIntentionally or not, the ravioli bites serve as a callback to the hand injury Scheffler suffered over the holidays last year; the two-time Masters champ cut his hand cooking ravioli for Christmas dinner and needed surgery to remove some of the glass.\nThankfully, Scheffler won't be in the kitchen in Augusta on April 8, so the only hazard he'll have to watch out for is stains on his outfit.\nTake a peek at the full menu, which also features the return of the ribeye steak and blackened redfish, below:\nThe 2025 Masters Tournament will run from April 10 to April 13 at Augusta National Golf Course. After playing host, Scheffler will, of course, be competing in the tourney for his third green jacket.",

    "text": "The\nU.S. Census Bureau didn’t properly administer or monitor contract orders worth hundreds of millions of dollars dealing with advertising to promote participation in the 2020 census, possibly wasting taxpayers’ dollars, according to the Office of Inspector General.\nBureau contracting officers failed to make sure standards were followed to measure the performance of a contractor and didn’t receive supporting documentation for paid media invoices totaling $363 million, according to an audit report released last month by the watchdog agency.\n“As a result, the bureau could have accepted substandard performance, potentially wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on advertising that did not fully meet program goals and reach intended audiences,” the report said.\nThe inspector general’s audit focused on $436.5 million worth of contract orders for paid advertising promoting participation in the once-a-decade head count that determines political power and\nthe allocation of $2.8 trillion in federal funding in the U.S.\nOne example was an order in May 2020 to spend $2.2 million on flyers placed on pizza boxes that promoted filling out the census questionnaire online during the early days of stay-at-home orders issued because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bureau couldn’t provide supporting documentation showing that the flyers had been delivered in ZIP codes where the intended audience lived, the audit report said.\nWhile the findings in the audit report are valid, the communications campaign was a success despite\nfacing many challenges, the Census Bureau said in a response. The agency promised to require documentation and agreed to provide necessary training to all contracting officers on how to monitor contractors.\nThe U.S. head count campaign was the first to encourage all participants to fill out the form online and also\nfaced unprecedented obstacles in reaching people from the pandemic, wildfires, hurricanes and social justice protests that sometimes hampered census takers’ ability to reach homes, according to the bureau.\nThe campaign “increased awareness of the census and encouraged self-response through a variety of communication channels, successfully pivoting to use innovative communication techniques in lieu of in-person local and national activities,” the bureau said.\nFollow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter:\n@MikeSchneiderAP.",

Le préfet appelle les habitants mal-logés à se rendre dans les centres d'hébergement du département.\nL'archipel de Mayotte sera placé en alerte rouge cyclonique ce vendredi à 22h (20h à Paris) en raison du passage du cyclone Chido, a annoncé le préfet de ce département français dans l'océan Indien. « C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h », a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse.\nLe préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, « seront ouverts à tous », a-t-il assuré.\nRafales, pluies intenses et vagues submersives\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un « cyclone tropical intense » explique Météo-France, qui prévoit « de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer ». Ces conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent « un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral » a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à « impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme ».\nAéroport et écoles fermés\nToute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22 heures et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20 heures (18h heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet. La dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17 h 30. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",

    "title": "¿Por qué Rusia no participa en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?",
    "text": "¿Por qué Rusia no participa en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?\nSofía Benavides\n(CNN) — El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) decidió en octumbre de 2023 suspender la participación en los Juegos Olímpicos de París que están a punto de comenzar al Comité Olímpico Ruso, lo que implicó la pérdida de financiamiento y el hecho de que el COI se reserva el derecho de decidir sobre la participación de atletas con pasaporte ruso en tanto deportistas neutrales.\n¿Por qué el Comité Olímpico Internacional suspendió a Rusia?\nTras la invasión rusa de Ucrania —apoyada por Belarús— en febrero de 2022, el COI recomendó que se prohibiera a los atletas rusos y bielorrusos competir en eventos deportivos internacionales. En enero de 2023, el COI anunció su intención de permitir que estos atletas compitan como neutrales, de forma similar a cómo se presentan los tenistas rusos y bielorrusos en otros eventos deportivos como ATP, WTA y Grand Slam, sin ninguna referencia a su nacionalidad.\nLuego, sin embargo, el COI suspendió por completo al Comité Olímpico Ruso en octubre de 2023, debido a que Rusia había absorvido a las organizaciones deportivas regionales ucranianas en Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia.\nCalendario de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024: horarios, competiciones y fechas\n“La decisión unilateral adoptada por el Comité Olímpico Ruso el 5 de octubre de 2023 de incluir entre sus miembros a las organizaciones deportivas regionales que están bajo la autoridad del Comité Olímpico Nacional (CON) de Ucrania (a saber, Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia) constituye una violación de la Carta Olímpica porque viola la integridad territorial del CON de Ucrania, reconocida por el COI de conformidad con la Carta Olímpica”, afirma el COI sobre el episodio de octubre.\nPese a esa dura decisión, la comisión ejecutiva del COI dictaminó que sería injusto castigar a los atletas basándose únicamente en sus pasaportes, lo que abrió la posibilidad de permitir que algunos compitan en París, aunque bajo condiciones muy estrictas.\nMariya Lasitskene, del Comité Olímpico de Rusia, ganó la medalla de oro en salto de altura femenino en los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio. (Noticias de Kyodo/Getty Images)\n“Sin bandera, himno, ni colores”\nUn “Atleta Neutral Individual” es el nombre utilizado para referirse a los atletas con pasaporte ruso o bielorruso que competirán en los juegos de este año. Se hace referencia a estos atletas con la abreviatura AIN, que proviene de la traducción francesa Athlètes Individuels Neutres.\n¿Qué significa AIN en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?\nA estos atletas se les permitirá competir siempre y cuando cumplan con los requisitos de elegibilidad.\n“Las sanciones contra los responsables de la guerra, los Estados y gobiernos de Rusia y Belarús, siguen vigentes para los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024”, afirmó el COI en un comunicado.\n“No se exhibirá ninguna bandera, ni se cantará el himno, ni se mostrarán colores ni ninguna otra identificación de Rusia o Belarús en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024, en ninguna sede oficial ni en ninguna función oficial”, continúa el comunicado.\nLa vestimenta de competición de los AIN aún no ha sido revelada, por lo que no está claro si llevarán los colores turquesa de la flamante bandera de los AIN, o si vestirán ropa deportiva básica. También se ha encargado un himno, sin letra, para su uso en ceremonias de entrega de medallas.\nAunque los AIN son elegibles para competir y ganar medallas olímpicas, no figurarán en el medallero de las naciones.\nLos AIN también serán excluidos del desfile de delegaciones en la Ceremonia de Apertura por ser atletas individuales y no un equipo, aunque el COI ha dicho que “se les brindará la oportunidad de vivir el evento”.\nLa versión final de la bandera de AIN asignada por el COI el 19 de marzo. (COI)\nCuáles son los requisitos para competir como AIN\nEn diciembre de 2023, la Junta Ejecutiva del COI decidió que los atletas rusos y bielorrusos que se clasificaron a través de los sistemas de clasificación existentes de las federaciones internacionales tendrían que cumplir requisitos estrictos para ser seleccionados como AIN.\nNo habrá representación rusa ni bielorrusa en las pruebas por equipos y la participación se limitará a la competencia individual.\nSegún el COI, los atletas que apoyen activamente la guerra o que estén contratados por el ejército o las agencias de seguridad nacional rusas o bielorrusas no serán elegibles para inscribirse ni competir. La misma estipulación se aplica al personal de soporte.\nComo todos los demás atletas, los AIN deberán cumplir requisitos antidopaje para ser considerados para la selección.\nLa elegibilidad de estos atletas será determinada por el recientemente establecido Panel de Revisión de Elegibilidad de Atletas Neutrales Individuales.\nEn los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio 2020 (aplazados hasta 2021 debido a la pandemia de covid-19) y en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de 2022 en Beijing, los atletas rusos compitieron bajo el nombre del Comité Olímpico Ruso (ROC) como resultado de un dopaje patrocinado por el Estado.\nCuántos AIN competirán en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024\nEl COI afirmó que, hasta el 28 de marzo, 12 AIN con pasaporte ruso y siete AIN con pasaporte bielorruso se habían clasificado para París 2024. “El número máximo, que es poco probable que se alcance, sería 55 y 28 respectivamente”, dijo el COI a CNN.\nEn comparación, Rusia envió 330 atletas a Tokio en 2021, mientras que Belarús envió 104.\nTambién está la cuestión de si Moscú aceptará realmente las condiciones establecidas por el COI. Es que Rusia planea organizar sus propios “Juegos de la Amistad” a finales de este año, un evento que ha sido condenado por el COI.\nLa identidad de los atletas aún no se ha revelado, pero es posible que el exnúmero 1 del mundo, el tenista ruso Daniil Medvedev, forme parte del campo. El excampeón del US Open dijo que estaría feliz de participar como un actor neutral.\n“Decidí por mí mismo que siempre que pueda participar en los Juegos Olímpicos, quiero estar allí y quiero representar lo que pueda representar”, dijo a los periodistas el mes pasado. “Si no es bajo la bandera, (igual) sé quién soy, sé por qué juego tenis y jugué así toda mi vida”.\nCon información de Sam Joseph, de CNN\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
