El hombre, identificado como Mohamed Sayel al Jundi, murió después de que el Ejército israelí disparara contra él cerca del puesto de control de Al Nafaq, al oeste de Belén, según ha recogido la agencia de noticias palestina WAFA. Esto se produce en el marco del recrudecimiento de la violencia en Cisjordania después de que Israel lanzara una cruenta contraofensiva contra la Franja de Gaza tras los ataques ejecutados el 7 de octubre por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás), que dejaron unos 1.200 muertos y cerca de 240 secuestrados. Las autoridades de Gaza, controladas por el grupo islamista palestino, han denunciado más de 21.300 muertos a causa de la ofensiva israelí contra la Franja. - item no encontrado",

    "text": "There is a video of the story of the execution of a brilliant army officer, Major Daniel Bamidele, circulating right now. My wife drew my attention to it two days ago and I told her that I was familiar with the story. Many news magazines had written about it in the 1980s when the tragic incident took place. The 1980s was the decade when the genre of news magazine flourished in Nigeria. The magazines carried reports and stories which were well researched, deep and detailed. It was the era of investigative journalism. The stories provided us history on the go. There was also the literary angle to the stories that were beautifully written by journalists that honed their writing skills beyond the ordinary. The stories were informative, educative and entertaining. We carry fond memories of Newswatch, African Concord, The African Guardian, This Week, and by the 1990s, TELL, The News, Tempo, and others joined the tradition. Newswatch founded by the quartet of Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu, Yakubu Mohammed and Dan Agbese clearly led the pack until after the death after Giwa. The tradition suffered some dull moments until TELL and later The News burst forth provocatively in the 1990s. The two decades of the 1980s and 1990s were tremulous for Nigeria and we are yet to exit the damning consequences of the political cataclysm that assailed the nation in those gory years. The Nigerian experience of those decades was tragically authored in blood. Major Daniel Bamidele, the subject of the video in circulation, was one of the many unfortunate victims of the gnarled era. As narrated in the video, the same narrative offered by Newswatch in 1986, the time of Bamidele’s execution, the young officer heard about a coup in late 1983 and patriotically reported to his boss. Instead of a pat on the back, Bamidele was arrested for coup-plotting and detained in Lagos. Eventually a coup took place on the last day of the year and Bamidele was surprised that his boss to whom he reported the coup was the new head of the state. Bamidele was released from detention and went back to his duty post. Two years later, 1985, he heard of another coup in the making and he kept quiet remembering what happened in 1983. When the lid was blown off the coup attempt, he was arrested for failing to report. He was tried along other coup plotters, found guilty, tied to the stake and executed by firing squad for failing to report the coup not that he was one of the plotters! The sad story of Bamidele should be taken beyond its individual context to reflect the tragedy of military rule in Nigeria as that which not only took lives, but traumatized relatives and left a deep and un-erasable scar on our national psyche. The coups and counter-coups that plagued Nigeria from the 1960s to the 1990s destroyed the foundation of this nation. The military became its worst enemy as espirit de corps was destroyed and in the words of Lt. General Ibrahim Salihu, who escaped the hangman’s noose at the time of Major Bamidele’s ordeal and later became Chief of Army Staff, the Nigerian army became “an army of anything goes”. Those calling for coup during the recent ENDBADGOVERNANCE protest, especially in the north, need to revisit our history to get acquainted with the complex ills of military rule. There is a consensus that it ought not to have been an option in the first place. Many of those who participated in the protest are young people who were born after 1999. Others were toddlers who were not old enough to understand what happened in the wake of the June 12 crisis that engulfed the nation from 1993 to 1998. What culminated in Bamidele’s tragedy and on a wider scale Nigeria’s ruin, dates back to 15th January 1966 when young military officers of the rank of major and below overthrew the administration of Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The administration which piloted Nigeria at independence was accused of corruption and other ills. The magnitude of the ills has been lucidly recounted in the satire A Man of the People by Chinua Achebe. Within six hours of action, the soldiers had murdered many leading political and military officers mostly of northern origin. Among the soldiers killed was a senior officer who had his marriage party on the night of the coup, a party where the coup plotters ate and drank and danced. Another senior officer was murdered alongside his pregnant wife! It was a bloody night. What followed was a more blood cuddling tragedy in the form of a revenge coup on 29th July 1966. The dogs of war were let loose on the nation and blood flowed. When the killing ceased temporarily, the head of state, Major General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi, had been killed. The same fate befell many officers and soldiers of eastern Nigerian origin. The Nigerian civil war that took an irreparable toll on the Nigerian psyche and from which we are unable to recover was the direct consequence of the two coups. The war devastated Nigeria for thirty months and its cost in human and material terms remains incalculable! The ugly side of the July 1966 coup was that it bequeathed to Nigeria a generation of coup merchants whose motivation wasn’t nationalism, but governance as mercantilism. The soldiers who executed the coup of July 1966 enacted a bloodless one again in the month of July in 1975, the exact day of the ninth anniversary of their earlier coup. Seven months later, a disgruntled faction turned blazing rifles on the new head of state and snuffed life out of him on his way to the office one Friday morning. The perpetrators were arrested, tried and executed in a most bloody manner. Later revelations indicated that some of those executed were innocent officers framed by those envious of their prospects and who saw them as obstacles to their future involvement in coups and political leadership. Widows and orphans emerged from the executions which traumatized the nation and the world. One of the widows, an Irish, got her four sons into a car, deliberately drove at a prohibitive speed and rammed into a stationary truck. The destabilizing character of military coups was again at play in 1983, the one that Bamidele reported. The only major casualty of that coup was one of the plotters, Brigadier Ibrahim Bako. The coup begot another coup that was plotted by a faction of the same officers in August 1985. It was given the elegant name of a “palace coup” and it was bloodless. If Nigerians thought they had seen the last of bloody coups, they were shocked into numbness between December 1985 and March 1986, when some military officers including the best friend of the then military president to whom he served as best man at his wedding sixteen years earlier were arrested, tried and executed for coup-plotting. It was here that Bamidele met his untimely death. Like the executions of 1976, opinions were expressed that there was no enough evidence to warrant the execution of Major General Vatsa for involvement in the coup. In April 1990 another coup bloodier in execution and consequence that the December 1985 coup took place. We felt the tremors of the coup across Urhoboland because the leading plotters were not only Urhobo officers, but old boys of Government College, Ughelli in the heartland of Urhobo. Besides the summary execution of the young officers implicated in the coup, their contemporaries made up of about one hundred sixty military officers perished in a plane crash on their way to a course in Jaji in September 1992. That tragedy was interpreted as a preemptive action. My father in law who was a captain in the army at the time was repeatedly interrogated in the middle of the night by the military police until convinced of his innocence he was let go, but compulsory retirement awaited him. We celebrate his survival or who else would have handed my wife to me during our marriage exactly twenty-one years ago when I married her? Major General Iliya Bisalla wasn’t that lucky in 1976. He was implicated on the day he was to be set free. He had to face the firing squad. He didn’t live to give his daughter, Salamatu, to Femi Gbajabiamila! The tensed political atmosphere of the 1990s threw up coups and countercoups. In 1995 and 1997 and even before then, many brilliant, but ambitious officers lost their lives for getting implicated in real and phantom coups. Coups have done Nigeria no good. Coups destroy and kill. Those who delegitimized history should see the grave danger such an act posed for our country. A generation with a sense of history will not be calling for a military coup when we have endured uninterrupted civil rule in the last twenty-five years. Obafemi Awolowo had been quoted to have said that the worst kind of democracy is better than the best form of military rule. Let Nigerians continue to engage the process of nation building by exercising civic responsibilities by voting during elections and by civil disobedience when necessary. May Nigeria not go through the dangerous valley of military rule again!",

    "text": "当品牌还在依赖亲朋同事的小圈子，通过人力手动搜索“盲测”AI提及率时，可曾意识到：面对单平台每日数千万次的AI搜索提问，这种原始方法的样本量无异于盲人摸象！正是因为市场缺乏科学系统的AI可见度监测方法，导致品牌在AI世界集体失语——GEO（生成式引擎优化）方向盲目、衡量标准空白，连效果汇报都举步维艰。\n生成式AI搜索：“第二页消亡”的颠覆性信息中介\nAI监测缺位的背后，是搜索机制发生了根本性改变。在传统搜索引擎中，品牌即使没有被算法优先推荐，但信息仍能在次级页面（如搜索结果第二页、信息流深处）被用户看见。然而AI搜索彻底删除了这个“第二页”，它的响应是唯一性、生成式、结论化的，基于对海量信息的理解和推理，直接生成一个“答案”。\n这带来一个残酷的现实：品牌面临的将不再是“排名靠后”，而是彻底的“消失”。未被AI模型有效识别并理解其价值的品牌，根本不会出现在这个唯一的答案中。用户没有翻页选项，品牌失去曝光与转化的机会。“不被AI认知”直接等同于“不被消费者看见”。\n难以监测的真相：生成式黑箱与认知逻辑的双重屏障\nAI生成式应答的运作机制，让传统监测工具彻底失效。传统工具依赖抓取搜索结果页（如链接列表、关键词位置）。而现在的AI回答只会输出一段整合的答案，没有列表可追踪，没有标签可计数，甚至没有固定模板可解析。\n此外，AI认知评估信息的逻辑也迥异于传统营销。在AI认知体系中，传统营销追求的“吸引眼球”（注意力）的内容很难被采纳。AI认知的关键在于“信息分辨率”，是否能够清晰、准确、结构化地呈现品牌本质、价值及与世界的关联。\n这正是GEO（生成式引擎优化）诞生的核心原因，推动搜索优化从传统SEO的关键词匹配，转向聚焦概念构建与关系锚定的认知升级：\n● 概念构建：清晰定义品牌的核心价值主张、关键技术优势、独特解决方案。避免模糊口号，聚焦“是什么”和“为什么独特”。\n● 关系锚定：深刻阐述品牌与具体用户需求、应用场景、待解决痛点之间的强关联。回答“为谁解决什么问题”和“在什么情境下最优”。\n基于iPowerAI iGeo可见度向量引擎的测量，一些拥有市场高认知度的品牌，并没有成为AI的首选推荐。目前，很多国际品牌已着手大量重写并替换互联网上关于自身的描述文案，以提升在AI世界的存在感。\n评估品牌的AI存在感，需要全新的测量维度\nAI可见度：当用户提出品类相关问题时，你的品牌被AI想起并主动提及的概率，这是品牌进入消费者视野的基本门槛。缺乏AI可见度监测的品牌，如同在黑暗森林中航行，不知自身位置，不明竞品方位。\nAI推荐度：当用户需求与品牌价值高度契合时，你的品牌成为AI首选推荐的比率，这直接关系转化潜力和市场份额的争夺。AI推荐本质是“决策短路器”，当用户接受“XX品牌是该品类首选”的结论时，比较环节被直接跳过。\nAI情感倾向：AI在提及品牌时，语言所传达的情感基调（积极、中性、消极）以及支撑评价的具体理由（被识别的优点、缺点），这深刻影响品牌声誉和用户信任。\n同时，不同生成式AI搜索引擎的后台模型不同，拥有各自独特的训练数据、响应逻辑和信息源。这让品牌在不同平台上的“认知表现”（可见度、推荐度、情感倾向）呈现巨大差异。举例，基于iPowerAI iGeo 的AI可见度向量引擎分析，某美妆品牌在A平台提及率达70%，在B平台却不足20%。因此，理解不同平台的AI模型，对于制定有效的GEO优化策略至关重要。\n综上所述，品牌想要精准监测品牌在AI世界中“存在感”困难重重，传统或者通用的监测工具难以捕捉AI动态生成场景的复杂性，缺乏细颗粒度、跨平台、语义化的评估能力。\niPowerAI iGeo AI可见度向量引擎，照亮品牌的AI认知坐标\niPowerAI iGeo 推出国内首个AI可见度向量引擎，基于十大AI Agent集群与不同生成式AI搜索引擎的大模型高频交互、数据解析、思维链推理及数十万次测试，为品牌绘制精细颗粒度的AI认知图谱：\n● 跨模型语义分析：突破单一平台限制，深度解析DeepSeek、元宝等主流AI引擎的生成逻辑与内容偏好。\n● 动态向量化建模：将抽象的“品牌提及”、“推荐倾向”等概念，转化为可量化、可比较的“认知能见度”向量。\n● 三维竞争力图谱：\n基于竞争力图谱，品牌可以快速分析自身在不同AI搜索引擎中的表现，提取关键词、情感倾向和趋势变化，更精准地预测市场动向并做出科学决策。\n当用户习惯向AI询问“该买什么”而非“哪里买”时，品牌的AI可见度已成为新时期的战略生命线。iGeo AI可见度向量引擎首次实现了对国内生成式AI搜索的认知测绘，让品牌清晰看见自身在AI认知坐标中的位置，更精准地优化投放，赢得每一次影响用户决策的机会。\niPower iGeo已正式商用！\n想即刻拥有您的专属AI智能体嘛？\n扫码即刻获取\n或者可以通过以下方式联系我们：\n公众号：\niPowerAI邮箱：business@ipowerai.cn\niPowerAI网站：www.ipowerai.cn",

    "text": "- Diario El Universal 28/12/2023 06:47 pm Caracas.- El Secretario General de Acción Democrática (AD), Bernabé Gutiérrez, detalló que esta tolda política rechaza contundente la llegada del buque británico HMS Trent a las costas de Guyana. \"Desde #AcciónDemocrática rechazamos de manera contundente, la provocación orquestada por parte del Reino Unido, al anclar en aguas de Guyana el buque HMS Trent de la Armada Británica\", escribió a través de la red social X (Twitter). Adicionalmente, cuestionó que se haya violado lo acordado en la reciente declaración de Argyle, la cual fue firmó el presidente de Guyana Irfaan Alí y su par venezolano Nicolás Maduro. \"Apenas han transcurrido 14 días del encuentro binacional entre Guyana y Venezuela, en San Vicente y Las Granadinas, cuando ya Irfaan Alí da una patada a la mesa de diálogo y vulnera la reciente declaración de Argyle, hoja de ruta para abordar por la vía diplomática y pacífica, la controversia territorial por la Guayana Esequiba\", escribió Gutiérrez. Asimismo, pidió al Gobierno Nacional a que actúe en defensa de la patria, al mismo tiempo que recordó que el 3 de diciembre el pueblo venezolano votó masivamente en favor de recuperar la Guayana Esequiba. \"Ante este acto de provocación diplomática, es menester que el gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro, actúe con contundencia, que nuestras Fuerzas Armadas se pongan al frente en defensa de nuestra soberanía nacional\" dice el post y prosiguió diciendo que \"Ya el 3 de diciembre el pueblo soberano de Venezuela habló y a través del voto ordenó la lucha y defensa de nuestro Esequibo. Pues bien, ahora a cumplir con los sabios designios de nuestro pueblo\". Por último recalcó que Venezuela no aceptará nunca la injerencia extranjera en los asunto internos. \"No aceptamos injerencias de potencias extranjeras que quieren pescar en río revuelto en la disputa territorial entre Venezuela y Guyana\", puntualizó.

    "title": "Without Clean Water, Pacific Islanders Turn To Sugary Drinks. Tackling This Could Reduce Obesity",
    "text": "Author: Pierre Levasseur ( MENAFN - The Conversation) One in two people in the Pacific Islands is classified as overweight (with a body mass index of 25–29) or obese (a BMI 30 or above). This is a problem because obesity increases the risk of health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, strokes and some cancers.\nWhile various factors contribute to obesity, limited access to clean drinking water plays an overlooked role . Without a safe drinking water supply, many households may turn to sugary drinks as an alternative. This type of substitution increases the risk of obesity.\nOur new research explored how water insecurity in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati correlates with sugary drink consumption. We used survey data, including more than 2,000 of households spread over 21 rural and urban islands, to track locals' water supply and their consumption of sugary drinks such as soft drinks and juice.\nWater insecurity is a big issue in Kiribati, with households relying mainly on unprotected groundwater (40%) and rainwater (28%) for drinking.\nWe found households that relied on unprotected groundwater and rainwater drank 381–406 grams more sugary drinks per week than those with access to a piped water system. For households with water insecurity, this brings their weekly consumption to more than 1.7 litres.\nDietary drivers of obesity Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Republic of Kiribati comprises 33 low-lying islands (with an average height of 3 metres above sea level) and a population of 133,000.\nThe Kiribati archipelago is spread across a wide maritime territory, neighbouring other Pacific countries such as Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. This makes our results relatively generalisable to other enclaved countries and small island developing states in Micronesia.\nNot all residents have access to safe drinking water. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , CC BY Households in the Pacific Islands are already grappling with the dietary changes globalisation and urbanisation have brought. Traditional diets of fresh fish, root vegetables and local fruits have been partially replaced by processed foods and sugary drinks. These are high in calories and low in nutrition.\nThese dietary shifts, combined with water insecurity, create an environment that exacerbates health challenges and contributes to obesity.\nWhat can be done about it? Only one-third of the population in Kiribati has access to a safe piped water system for drinking.\nThe rest of the population use unprotected groundwater and rainwater. But they cannot afford expensive tank kits, filters and treatment systems to remove harmful contaminants in water such as animal waste and chemicals. Locals are aware of these risks and therefore look to other options.\nImproving access to clean, safe drinking water can be a cost-effective public policy that reduces sugary drink consumption and addresses the broader public health challenge of obesity.\nTo achieve this goal, a number of interventions are needed, such as:\nensuring households that rely on rainwater harvesting have access to tank kits, filters and treatment systems to remove harmful contaminants developing seawater desalination plants that rely on clean energy sources. This would improve access to clean, piped water but comes at a significant cost\ntaxing sugary drinks to reduce consumption. In Mexico , a 10% increase in the price of sugary drinks led to an 11.6% decrease in their consumption.\nKiribati diets have changed dramatically with globalisation. maloff/Shutterstock Climate change will compound the problem Water insecurity in small island developing nations such as Kiribati are exacerbated by climate change . Rising sea levels are contaminating freshwater sources with salt, while more frequent and severe droughts are straining already limited resources.\nThese climate-related pressures make it increasingly difficult for communities to access clean drinking water, entrenching reliance on sugary drinks.\nThis phenomenon is similar in countries characterised by higher levels of sugary drinks imports and intakes such as in Niue, Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Palau, but also for Australia's remote Indigenous communities for whom access to safe drinking water isn't guaranteed and sugary drink consumption is high .\nAddressing water insecurity and obesity in tandem offers an opportunity to create sustainable solutions and build resilience against some of the adverse effects climate change can have on public health.\nMENAFN19122024000199003603ID1109014437",
