    "text": "[LUBBOCK, Texas](https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/lubbock-man-who-tampered-with-evidence-after-lakaria-moores-murder-pleads-guilty/) — Jermaal Riggins, 37, who was arrested in connection with the death of Lakaria Moore, 18, has pleaded guilty on Thursday to tampering with evidence and unlawful possession to a firearm. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. EverythingLubbock.com previously reported Moore was first reported missing on May 21, 2023. Her remains were found the next day in the truck of 40-year-old Christopher Carter’s car near North County Road 3000 and East County Road 6650. Carter, Moore’s boyfriend, was later identified as a person of interest and a warrant was obtained for his arrest. When police searched Carter’s home after Moore’s disappearance, officers found ammunition, shell casings, bleach and Pine Sol, among other items. Police also found a bloody blanket and towels in a dumpster behind Carter’s home. On July 31, Carter was found at the Stadium Motel in the 4100 block of 19th Street with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Lubbock Police Department said Riggins “altered, destroyed or concealed evidence with the intent to make it unavailable as evidence.” Along with Riggins, Tahdeejah Washington-Harris, 29, was also accused of helping Carter evade police. Washington-Harris admitted she helped Carter with hotel rooms and money while avoiding arrest. Riggins was scheduled to turn himself in on July 12 to face his prison sentence.

    "text": "There are some basic upkeep-type tasks that you need to do to maintain your vehicle in good working order. It's easy to put those automotive responsibilities off when you are very busy. Unfortunately, procrastination of this kind usually catches up with you. That is what a TikTok user named Emily sheepishly discovered when she failed to change the oil in her car for two years . Not good, Emily! If you don't take care of your wheels, they won't take care of you.\nShe posted about the major consequences of her lack of attentiveness to her car. Emily probably did that in hopes of sparing others the same unhappy fate. We are passing it along so you won't endure what she went through!\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nWhen Should You Change The Oil In Your Vehicle? This Is An Issue Definitely Worth Knowing About What Happened To Emily's Car? Unfortunately, It's Now Apparently Done For Emily's Car Was Smoking Badly It Understandably Alarmed Emily When Should You Change The Oil In Your Vehicle? This Is An Issue Definitely Worth Knowing About\nPer Consumer Reports , the traditional guidance of having an oil change \"every 3,000 miles or every three months\" does not really apply anymore. \"Many automakers have oil-change intervals at 7,500 or even 10,000 miles and six or 12 months,\" advises the publication.\nJohn Ibbotson, a Consumer Reports automotive expert , s tates , \" Your owner's manual has more detailed information about your car than any mechanic does. Don't get talked into too-often oil changes. Follow the manual and your car's engine should stay well-lubricated and perform well.\"\nHandy, common-sense advice!\nWhat Happened To Emily's Car? Unfortunately, It's Now Apparently Done For Emily acknowledged on TikTok via Unilad that she interpreted the warning lights on her dashboard as a mere \"suggestion.\" Big mistake! Those lights mean something. When they go on, you should promptly check out what they are indicating. It could be a minor issue or a significant one.\nShe also mentioned that in three years, she only had a single oil change.\nSo the stage was set for a problem....\n@emsinggg0 Its smoking and acting up?!? #brokencar #oilchange #valvolineinstantoilchange #carproblemsbelike? #mycarbrokedown\n♬ original sound - Emily ?\nEmily's Car Was Smoking Badly It Understandably Alarmed Emily Emily's husband told her to change the oil, but even that did not remedy the issue.

I was like, 'I think it's more than just getting my oil changed. There's something going on in here'.\"\nYup, there was. Smoke kept coming from the car to an extent that Emily was wary of driving it.\n\"I'm pretty sure I ruined my car,\"Emily conceded.\nThe lesson here is to always be current with your vehicle's maintenance.

    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard commemorated her first full day of freedom with a selfie. She took to Instagram Friday to mark her release from prison by snapping a quick pic of her smiling, writing “First selfie of freedom!” in the caption. Blanchard, who conspired with her then-boyfriend Nick Godejohn to kill her abusive mother in 2015 , was released from prison early Thursday morning. She pled guilty to a second-degree murder charge on Tuesday, July 5, 2016 and served about 85% of her 10-year sentence, spending a total of eight years behind bars for her role in the murder. She became eligible for parole in September. Blanchard also recently announced the release of an eBook titled “Release,” set to come out on Jan. 9. Here’s what we know about Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Gypsy Rose Blanchard coverage: Gypsy Rose Blanchard's release from prison latest twist in shocking Munchausen by Proxy case Gypsy Rose Blanchard , who is Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard’s daughter, was made to believe she suffered from a wide range of medical ailments including leukemia, asthma and muscular dystrophy thanks to her mother. Gypsy’s late mother was accused of having made her daughter appear to have a range of physical and developmental ailments, USA Today previously reported. Dee Dee Blanchard, later said to have Munchausen syndrome by proxy which is a mental condition in which someone makes another person ill for sympathy or gain received disability payments and gifts from charities all of Gypsy’s illnesses, that often led to painful treatment and procedures. Gypsy, who used a wheelchair before it was discovered she could walk , said she was desperate to escape her mother's abuse and sought help from her online boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn. Godejohn, who was was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing and killing Dee Dee Blanchard, traveled to Missouri on June 9, 2015 to help enact the escape plan. He was reportedly let into the home after Gypsy’s late mother fell asleep and used a knife handed to him by Gypsy to stab the sleeping woman 17 times, killing her before fleeing to his native Wisconsin, USA Today previously reported. Gypsy later told ABC 20/20 news she hid in the bathroom with hands over her ears during the act. Authorities were contacted about a post on Dee Dee Blanchard’s Facebook page dated June 14, 2015 that read, ‘That B*** is dead!’ before her body was found in her home with multiple stab wounds. Before Gypsy was publicly tied to the murder, many Springfield residents were worried that she was also in peril. The bizarre nature of the Springfield murder made national headlines and became the subject of documentaries and streamed television series . Gypsy and her boyfriend were arrested on June 14, 2015 in Big Bend, Wisconsin. The pair posted two updates on Dee Dee Blanchard’s Facebook page earlier that day to draw attention to her yet undiscovered body. Gypsy Rose Blanchard was born July 29, 1991, making her 32 years old in 2023. Dee Dee Blanchard was born May 3, 1967, making her 48 years old when she was killed in 2015. Gypsy married Ryan Scott Anderson in July 2022. Anderson is 37-year-old teacher based in Lake Charles, Louisiana, according to “ People .” The pair split after three months of marriage but eventually reconciled, the magazine reported. She shared with various news outlets that she planned on attending a Kansas City Chiefs game with her husband after her release, stating that she hopes she gets to meet superstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, USA Today previously reported.",
