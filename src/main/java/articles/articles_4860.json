    "text": "By Michael Hallisey ,\n1 hours ago DEC investigates release of 1,100 pounds of 2,6-Xylenol as residents report eye irritation, foul smells SABIC’s chemical spill raises concerns: no immediate threat, but public safety questions linger SELKIRK —It remains unclear whether there is a connection between the airborne odors residents have complained about since late November and the recently reported chemical spill at the SABIC plastic fabrication facility.\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 18, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) confirmed it is investigating reports of unpleasant odors near the SABIC facility following a chemical release earlier in the week. The investigation began after an inquiry by Spotlight News .\nAccording to the DEC, the incident occurred at approximately 7 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 16, when a malfunction at the SABIC plant caused the accidental release of about 1,100 pounds of 2,6-Xylenol, a chemical compound commonly used in manufacturing. The liquid was contained within the facility’s secondary containment system, where it solidified. SABIC is currently collecting the solidified material for proper disposal.\nAlthough local fire crews were not dispatched to the plastics plant during the spill, one unit in New Scotland did respond on Monday evening to a separate report of a noxious odor. A resident had complained of burning eyes. These incidents, along with the DEC’s subsequent report of the chemical release, appear to have been reported independently by residents.\nThe DEC stated that there is no immediate threat to public health or the environment. However, the agency is working with SABIC to determine the root cause of the malfunction and to implement corrective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The DEC is also monitoring compliance with environmental regulations.\n“While there is no immediate threat to public health or the environment, DEC is working closely with SABIC to investigate the root cause of the malfunction, implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents, and ensure compliance with all environmental regulations. DEC will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary,” the department stated.\nSABIC was contacted for comment but had not responded to email inquiries by Thursday afternoon.\nOn the night of the release, New Salem Fire Chief Steven Ayers said Albany County 911 received a call at 7:45 p.m. from a resident on Krumkill Road in the Town of New Scotland.\n“The caller said that the air smelled like iodine and it was causing their eyes to burn,” Ayers said. “I could smell it by our firehouse on Route 85.”\nThe fire department checked the area and attempted to trace the source of the smell.\n“We checked around the area all the way back [to Selkirk], but couldn’t find a source,” Ayers said. “We even called CSX to see what [trains] came through near that time, and there wasn’t any.”\nAyers said they could not confirm if the smell was coming from the SABIC plant but did notify county dispatchers, suggesting it might originate from that area.\nSelkirk Fire Chief Tom Neri stated that his department did not receive any notification of the release nor calls from the public. He noted that the SABIC facility has its own fire brigade to handle on-site incidents and local fire departments are only involved if assistance is requested.\nAlbany County Sheriff Craig Apple said he was unaware of any notification regarding the release. Bethlehem Town Supervisor David VanLuven similarly reported no knowledge of a notification but acknowledged receiving complaints about a chemical smell in the air over the past two weeks.\nIndustry data sheets indicate that 2,6-Xylenol is toxic if swallowed or in contact with skin, causing burns and eye damage. It is a key monomer in the synthesis of polyphenylene ether (PPE), a high-performance thermoplastic known for its durability and heat resistance.\nPPE is widely used in the production of automotive parts, electrical and electronic components, and industrial machinery.\nDespite the DEC’s statement, residents in Bethlehem have been reporting odors since late November. Most complaints were shared on social media, while some were directed to local volunteer firehouses.\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 20, residents described a foul odor and speculated that it originated from SABIC’s facility in Selkirk. However, the Delmar and Selkirk firehouses reported no evidence of a chemical spill. The smell was later attributed to brush fires in Massachusetts.\nThe National Weather Service in Albany confirmed that a developing low-pressure system off the East Coast caused easterly winds to carry smoke into the Capital District that day. Winds were recorded at approximately 7 mph from the east and northeast.\nAdditionally, Chief Ayers noted a persistent mulch fire on New Scotland South Road, which has been burning for two weeks and required multiple fire department responses.\nThe DEC has yet to establish a connection between the recent spill and the odors reported since November. However, past incidents involving SABIC suggest the potential for broader impacts. In 2020, over 22,000 pounds of styrene vapor were released from an improperly stored railroad tanker at the facility. Then-DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos reported smelling the vapor from his New Scotland home before receiving official notice of the release. SABIC was later fined $322,000 for mishandling the tanker.\nResidents are encouraged to report signs of contamination or chemical releases local 911 and to the NYS Spill Hotline at 1-800-457-7362.\nJohn McIntyre contributed to this report.\nThe post Connection between SABIC chemical spill and odor complaints still unclear as DEC investigates first appeared on Spotlight News .",

    "text": "Extreme Cold at -10°C, with Winds\nLower Feels-Like Temperature, Stay Healthy\nCold Wave Continues in Northern Gyeonggi\n[Cheonji Ilbo Gyeonggi=Kim Seojung] A cold wave warning has been issued for Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, and Paju in Gyeonggi Province, as extremely cold weather is expected to continue in northern Gyeonggi tomorrow (4th). The morning low temperatures in inland areas of northern Gyeonggi are forecasted to drop below -10°C, with strong winds further lowering the perceived temperatures.\nThe morning low temperatures in northern Gyeonggi are expected to range between -10°C and -5°C, while the daytime highs are forecasted to be between 3°C and 5°C. The skies will generally remain clear, although some clouds are expected to increase in the afternoon. The weather in the West Sea’s Five Islands (Seohae 5-do) will also remain partly cloudy.\nStarting early morning on the 5th, rain or snow is likely to fall in northern Gyeonggi. Significant snowfall of up to 3–8 cm is anticipated in the northwest and eastern regions of Gyeonggi, with some areas experiencing heavy, wet snow falling at a rate of 1–2 cm per hour. This will likely lead to icy roads, especially on bridges, elevated roads, and at tunnel entrances and exits, increasing the risk of accidents.\nTo ensure safety, residents are advised to prepare winter equipment for vehicles, check road conditions in advance, and use public transportation whenever possible.\nAccording to the Korea Meteorological Administration, northern Gyeonggi is expected to experience rain or snow due to an approaching trough of low pressure on the 5th. Subsequently, a cold continental high-pressure system is expected to expand, causing temperatures to plummet again significantly.\nResidents in northern Gyeonggi are strongly advised to stay informed about the latest weather updates, prepare for sudden temperature changes, and take precautions to ensure their health and safety.\n[제보하기](/jebo/)\n[costaricago@naver.com](mailto:costaricago@naver.com)\n[다른 기사 보기](/news/articleList.html?sc_area=I&sc_word=costaricago&view_type=sm)",

    "title": "Australian bishop Christopher Saunders arrested, charged with rape",
    "text": "Rome Newsroom, Feb 22, 2024 / 16:10 pm (CNA). Christopher Saunders, the bishop emeritus of Broome, Australia, has been arrested and charged with rape and other charges based at least in part on the findings of a Vatican investigation into allegations he abused vulnerable young men. Authorities announced Thursday that they were charging the 74-year-old prelate with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority, which reportedly occurred in the towns of Broome, Kununurra, and the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu between 2008 and 2014. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation [reported](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-22/former-broome-bishop-saunders-to-deny-19-criminal-charges/103496282) that Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him. Saunders was released on bail on a AU$10,000 ($6,500) bond on Thursday and has been ordered by the Broome Magistrates Court to reside at this home until the initial hearing in June. In a [press release](https://www.catholic.au/s/article/Matter-regarding-Bishop-Christopher-Saunders) published on Thursday, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said the allegations made against Saunders “are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations.” Noting that it is “right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated,” Costelloe expressed that the Church “will continue to cooperate fully with the police and take every necessary step to avoid any actions which may compromise the integrity and autonomy of the police investigation.” Saunders was ordained to the priesthood in 1976. Before he was appointed the bishop of Broome in 1996, he had several assignments with aboriginal parishes. The Diocese of Broome, a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Perth, is located in the remote northwestern region of Kimberley in the state of Western Australia and covers an area of approximately 297,000 square miles. Allegations were first made in 2020 against Saunders, who took a step back from the active governance of the diocese later that year. He formally resigned in 2021, citing “ill health.” After an initial police investigation did not result in any charges against Saunders, Pope Francis ordered a canonical investigation — the first of its kind in Australia — following his 2019 motu proprio [Vos Estis Lux Mundi](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/20230325-motu-proprio-vos-estis-lux-mundi-aggiornato.html), which established a new set of norms for the universal Church concerning the procedural handling of sexual abuse cases. The investigation was overseen by Archbishop Mark Coleridge of the Archdiocese of Brisbane but carried out by private investigators, culminating in a 200-page report. A new investigation was opened on the allegations brought against Saunders after the report was handed over to Australian police. In January, detectives from the Child Abuse Squad raided Saunders’ former home as part of “an ongoing investigation into historic child sex offenses.” Australian news outlet [7NEWS](https://7news.com.au/news/wa/wa-police-call-for-church-authorities-to-hand-over-vatican-report-into-bishop-of-broome-sex-scandal-c-11958237) in September 2023 obtained the investigative report, which detailed a pattern of grooming young men and occasions of coercing young men to undress and perform sexual acts. The report also noted that Saunders held “bunga-bunga” parties, which were attended only by young men. The bombshell report stated that Saunders “spent hundreds of thousands of dollars grooming vulnerable young Aboriginal males by supplying them with gifts of alcohol, telephones, cash, and travel.” “The bishop has been variously described by witnesses as … a sexual predator that seeks to prey upon vulnerable Aboriginal men and boys,” the investigative report said.
