    "title": "The Human Rights Commission’s moronic attack on Christmas",
    "text": "by Conrad Black\nIt is illustrative of the nonsense that now chronically afflicts our country and much of the Western world that the Canadian Human Rights Commission recently reported that statutory holidays for Christian celebrations, including Christmas, are “a form of discrimination” that is “deeply rooted in our identity as a settler colonialism state.” It is more accurate to say that the Human Rights Commission is a form of idiocy deeply rooted in our woke, politically correct foolishness.\nThe implication is the theory that the more extreme indigenous spokespeople are creeping up on, that the “settler-colonists” were invaders doing to the natives of Canada what Hitler and Stalin did to Poland. This is one of the initiatives in “a war on a Christmas,” a campaign for total secularization of all public life by a fusion of forces of atheism, anti-atheism, and of all those in revolt against any public, cultural or sectarian references to the Judeo-Christian heritage of our society. Of course, there is nothing remotely discriminatory about Christmas, as the birthday of the person traditionally recognized to be the only son of the Judeo-Christian God, in a time when monotheists were a small minority, a tradition of 2000 years that is now a holiday for all, and an occasion for the exchange of gifts and cordial greetings among all of society, as well as the renewal of religious faith for the majority of more than two billion Christians in the world. The theme, as everyone except the morons on the Human Rights Commission is aware, is peace on earth and goodwill toward everyone.\nWhat is discriminatory is violation of the prevalent concept in the Western world for several centuries, of a freedom of religious belief and practice, including those who commit the greatest act of faith of all and deny and disparage any spiritual forces, divine intelligence, or anything that transcends the world we know. This would enable a small minority to gag, stifle, and spiritually oppress the great majority of Canadians. It would be a monstrous act of discrimination, contemptibly disguised as a crusade against discrimination. No one in Canada who attaches a scintilla of credence to Christianity or anything related to Christmas seeks to coerce those who do not share their beliefs into observing Christmas.\nIt is a notorious fact that there have been many attempts in human history since the first Christmas 2024 years ago to outlaw Christmas and to persecute those who would celebrate it. No remotely receivable argument has ever been made or ever could be made to try to suppress that freedom. No sane Christian would ever try to enforce religious practice upon any adult. But Christianity does not enjoy reciprocity in these matters, and it is precisely the timeless indestructibility of that faith, or at least of its tradition, spontaneously in the minds of many hundreds of millions of people, that makes these claims of the Canadian Human Rights Commission unutterably stupid and an outrage against the beliefs and liberties of the majority of Canadians. This Commission has itself, become a battering ram being hurled against the rights and beliefs of the solid majority of Western Civilization for more than 1500 years, and will be no more successful than those who have undertaken the same maliciously quixotic mission over many prior centuries.\nIn practice, in contemporary times, such suggestions are usually made on behalf of Muslim organizations, as Dr. Peter Hammond alleges in his book cited last week in this space, ‘Slavery, Terrorism, and Islam.’ When Muslims are less than around two per cent of a country’s population, Hammond argues, they are generally peaceable and not a threat to institutions and practices. This is the case in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Italy, and Norway. As the Muslim population grows, so do demands for accommodation beyond what would normally be acceptable, such as request the applicability of sharia law in places. As the population grows further still, any non-Muslim action can be declared to be offensive to justify unreasonable reactions and even violence. For countries with majority Muslim populations, the persecution of non-believing “infidels” rises, as does the threat of terrorist attacks.\nNone of any of this is going to happen in Canada, but it should be noted that the organization chiefly discharging the mission to assure the freedoms and liberties of Canadians has adopted this Christmas season, the position that Christmas is oppressive, and must be abolished in a manner which elsewhere in the contemporary Western world, supports, precisely those religious and cultural forces, most implacably opposed to peace on earth and goodwill among men. Canada needs immigration to populate this large country, develop a distinctive national character, and exploit its resources responsibly (and cease to be ashamed of them). And instead of being ashamed of our admirable and enterprising pioneering origins, we should assure that those we admit to residency and citizenship accept and will not seek to overturn our institutions and will respect our liberties in the same measure that they enjoy them themselves.\nAs I wrote here last week, we must be both vigilant and tolerant. Merry Christmas and a happy new year to all, including the misguided boobs in the Human Rights Commission.\nFirst published in the\nNational Post.\n-\n-\nLike\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDel\n-\nTumblr\n-\nVKontakte\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n[Love This](#)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOdnoklassniki\n-\n-\nMeneame\n-\nBlogger\n-\nAmazon\n-\nYahoo Mail\n-\nGmail\n-\nAOL\n-\nNewsvine\n-\nHackerNews\n-\nEvernote\n-\nMySpace\n-\nMail.ru\n-\nViadeo\n-\nLine\n-\n-\n[Comments](#comments)\n-\nYummly\n-\n[SMS](sms:&body=The%20Human%20Rights%20Commission%27s%20moronic%20attack%20on%20Christmas%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newenglishreview.org%2Fthe-human-rights-commissions-moronic-attack-on-christmas%2F)\n-\n[Viber](viber://forward?text=The%20Human%20Rights%20Commission%27s%20moronic%20attack%20on%20Christmas%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newenglishreview.org%2Fthe-human-rights-commissions-moronic-attack-on-christmas%2F)\n-\n[Telegram](tg://msg?text=The%20Human%20Rights%20Commission%27s%20moronic%20attack%20on%20Christmas%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newenglishreview.org%2Fthe-human-rights-commissions-moronic-attack-on-christmas%2F)\n-\n[Subscribe](#)\n-\nSkype\n-\n[Facebook Messenger](fb-messenger://share/?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newenglishreview.org%2Fthe-human-rights-commissions-moronic-attack-on-christmas%2F)\n-\nKakao\n-\nLiveJournal\n-\nYammer\n-\n[Edgar](javascript:(function()%7B!function()%7Bvar e%3Ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")%5B0%5D,t%3Ddocument.createElement(\"script\")%3Bt.type%3D\"text/javascript\",t.src%3D\"//app.meetedgar.com/share.js%3F\"%2BMath.floor(99999*Math.random()),e.appendChild(t)%7D()%7D)()%3B)\n-\nFintel\n-\nMix\n-\nInstapaper\n-\n[Copy Link](#)",

The near-summery night temperatures prompted many of the women in the crowd to wear slipdresses and airy eveningwear in colorful hues with strappy sandals. The fashion quota might have been upped by the fact that Prada was back for the second year as the event’s sponsor.\nAlong with the MSK Society’s president Claudia Overstrom and the chair of the associates committee Austen Cruz, the designer-savvy attendees included Love Shack Fancy’s Rebecca Hessel Cohe n and Annie Taube, Vera Wang ’s Priya Shukla, J. Crew consultant Heather McAuliffe, Marcella Hymowitz, and Virginia Tomenson. They and a few hundred others turned up at the well-heeled gathering to support the MSK Society’s 2024 pediatric fundraising initiative — the MSK Kids Wellness Initiative. Some of the fresher faced under-30 attendees were junior members of the society, like junior event chairs Bates Crawford and Francesca Walton.

An interdisciplinary MSK Kids psychosocial support team focuses on individual and family care through programming that deals with emotional distress, resilience, and coping tools. Founded in 1946, the Society of MSK Cancer Center is a volunteer organization that raises funds for patient care. The center itself specializes in 400-plus cancer types and has nearly 2,000 clinical trials underway at any given time.

Earlier in the evening Cruz explained that the most challenging aspect of planning the event had been “figuring out the best way to showcase the MSK Kids Wellness initiative. We really want everyone in the room to understand how important it is and how we can all make a difference. Dr. Barnett has the best perspective of what these kids need.”\nOver drinks, many guests chatted about what the country needs post-election including Andrew Yang, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who attended the party with his wife Evelyn. The registered independent and cofounder of the third political party Forward, told WWD, “It’s a difficult day. It’s very sad. People around New York are still processing. I think folks realize that we need to do things differently and take a new approach, because what has been on offer isn’t working.”\nFrom his viewpoint, “The challenge is to address the four problems that the American people are experiencing in terms of affordability, their lives, their futures and feeling like their children don’t have as bright a time ahead as their parents had.”\nAs for whether Yang plans to make another run for president he said, “I get asked that every day. You always consider it.”\nTags J.

    "text": "La ministra colombiana de Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, alertó este jueves de un posible aumento de la deforestación en el departamento del Caquetá (sur), al tiempo que anunció que el Gobierno destinó siete helicópteros para atender los incendios que se pueden presentar en la Amazonía. “Estamos en el momento crítico, donde se suben los picos de deforestación y este cuarto trimestre (octubre, noviembre, diciembre) es fundamental, por las condiciones secas en la Amazonía (...) enviar la alerta a todas las autoridades locales”, señaló la ministra. [Le puede interesar: Minambiente lanza alerta: arrecifes coralinos presentan blanqueamiento](https://www.eluniversal.com.co/ambiente/minambiente-lanza-alerta-arrecifes-coralinos-presentan-blanqueamiento-XK9518617) Durante su visita a Cartagena del Chaira (Caquetá), aseguró que están listos siete helicópteros ‘Guacamayas’ para enfrentar incendios en la Amazonía colombiana. Además, advirtió a los deforestadores, que recurren a esta práctica para acaparar tierras, que están siendo vigilados por las autoridades para llevarlos a la Justicia. “Los acaparadores de tierra que creen que van a ir prendiendo fuego impunemente, pues les debo decir: los estamos observando”, aseguró al referirse a las acciones de la Fiscalía y del Consejo Nacional de Lucha Contra la Deforestación “para que quienes están acaparando tierras lleguen a rendir cuenta a la Justicia”. Al hacer referencia a lo que ocurre en el selvático departamento del Caquetá dijo que la deforestación ha disminuido este año 79 %, según cifras del Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales de Colombia (Ideam). En ese sentido, la ministra de Ambiente, con el respaldo de las entidades locales, ratificó el acuerdo firmado con los campesinos hace más de un año, que refleja resultados positivos, y aseguró que la lupa está puesta en no permitir que la deforestación aumente. “Cada hectárea de bosque que perdamos es una tragedia”, concluyó Muhamad.",
