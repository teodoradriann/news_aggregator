She [ took to Instagram Friday](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1cNGBvu7IK/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading) to mark her release from prison by snapping a quick pic of her smiling, writing “First selfie of freedom!” in the caption.

    "text": "First United Methodist Church holds first grocery drive of the year BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - Cars lined up outside of First United Methodist Church in College Station to receive a box of free groceries Saturday morning. It was for the Church’s Grocery Giveaway which is held the first Saturday of every month. The event started last year in June and it is a partnership with Brazos Valley Food Bank. Pastor Kefentse Risher said the number of people they serve varies, but it was around 300 people in December and they expected that number to be about the same on Saturday. “We average about 300 each and every time we do it,” Risher said. “It feels good to be able to fulfill a need for the community. We want to be thirty percent of complete health for Bryan College Station and this is one attempt, one meaningful ministry that pushes us towards that particular goal.” Those looking to volunteer don’t need to sign up or even be a member of the church, Risher said. “All you have to have is a willing heart to serve the community,” Risher said. “If you have a willing heart and you wanted to volunteer feel free to come out. If you are in need of groceries feel free to come on out and we will make sure you get served.” The church is located at 1125 Wellborn Rd. Copyright 2024 KBTX. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Anti-corruption authority clears deputy attorney general",
    "text": "The anti-corruption authority announced on Friday that there is no corruption on the part of the deputy attorney general Savvas Angelides over three cases forwarded to the authority by the audit office over potential conflict of interest. The authority added that [following their meeting](https://cyprus-mail.com/2023/12/28/anti-corruption-authority-to-release-findings-on-alleged-legal-service-conflicts/), they have also agreed with the findings by a team of foreign experts from the UK that examined the three allegations against Angelides. According to the authority, there was also no corruption found for the police officer referred to in the third complaint either. However, the authority will forward to the attorney-general a recommendation for criminal prosecution of the officer regarding his refusal to answer questions imposed on him by the investigating officers. The findings also noted the absence of a statutory procedure for conflict of interest. The complaints were submitted anonymously to the auditor general. He then considered that they did not fall within his own competence but concerned corruption issues, so he forwarded them to the authority. Specifically, these are the cases of three people, who were facing criminal cases for which Angelides registered a suspension of criminal prosecution. The allegations contained in those complaints are that Angelides was associated in a friendly and professional capacity with those defendants at a time prior to his appointment as deputy attorney-general and, due to conflict of interest, should have been excluded from considering and deciding their cases if there were any other motives for making those decisions to suspend criminal prosecution. These actions may constitute an abuse of power, an offence which is a corruption offence, the authority said. In the announcement, the authority said that in conducting a preliminary examination of the allegations, it considered, on the one hand, the case law on the existence of an unchecked power of the attorney-general, and in this case the deputy attorney-general, to suspend criminal prosecutions and, on the other hand, the allegations contained in the complaints. Having assessed all the facts, it decided to proceed with the investigation and appointed as Inspecting Officers George Campanellas, a solicitor from London, Tanveer Qureshi, a barrister from London, and George Liasides, a lawyer from Nicosia. The Inspecting Officers called witnesses to give evidence, who were called and appeared before them. They answered all but one of the questions put to them. Upon completion of the investigation and the study of all the evidence and data, the team drew up three reports, which they submitted to the authority for approval. In the first two complaints, in which the accused is Angelides, the existence of any corruption or abuse of power is not established. The testimony did not establish any acquaintance, either personal or professional, between the accused and the individuals for whom the prosecution had been suspended, the authority said. Regarding the third complaint, the authority said that, apart from Angelides, the accused was a senior police officer. The officer, according to the complaint, interceded outside the scope of his duties to Angelides to give a stay of prosecution to the accused. Coming forward for deposition, the officer produced two documents to the investigators, but refused to answer the questions put to him, citing that the documents related to “sensitive matters”. The report states that the officer’s refusal created obstruction of the investigation and that there was no reasonable cause for his refusal. The report said that the officer’s behaviour and refusal to answers questions might constitute a legal violation. Allegedly, Angelides had served as the attorney for someone who was a ‘person of interest’ for the police’s drug squad. In 2022 Angelides stayed a prosecution against this person. The name of drug squad chief Michalis Katsounotos was mentioned in this context. This may be linked to the affair where the attorney-general’s office decided against bringing charges against Katsounotos, whom the former prisons director Anna Aristotelous accused of spying on her and trying to frame her. Subsequently the attorney-general’s office also refused to give the green light to two private criminal prosecutions which Aristotelous’ lawyers wanted to file against Katsounotos.

    "title": "LGBTQ: No place for same sex marriage in the Church",
    "text": "…The Bible is against it – NBC\n…It is demonic – primate Udofia\n…Marriage is exclusive union of man &woman – CBCN\nA line from a pop song said, “The world will judge you, but God knows your heart”. That is the current state of the reaction that greeted Pope Francis declaration of Pastoral blessings on same sex marriage.\nWhile the pastoral blessings for same sex marriage by the Pope may have generated reactions that seems to divide the Church; it is clear however that the Church in Nigeria has taken its stand against any form of pastoral blessings of any form for persons in same sex relationships.\n“It’s important to reiterate that the Perilous days are truly here! Paul the Apostle was merely imagining such evil days in his mind then, but the reality is now here,” Tope Ilesanmi, PFN chairman, Ikeja province, told BusinessDay.\nAccording to him, every effort should be made by all well-meaning individuals to fight the current wave of evil in the name of LGBTQ, which is an acronym for Lesbians, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning.\n“The position of the Catholic Pope to bless same sex marriage is most appalling. Only a dehumanized fellow may be indifferent. Therefore, I decree that the LGBTQ agenda shall crumble in Nigeria in Jesus Name. And from Nigeria to other parts of the world.\n“That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other,” Ilesanmi said.\nAccording to him, God condemns LGBTQ yesterday, today and forever. “That’s what led to the burning of Sodom & Gomorrah. Similar judgment awaits those indulging themselves in this ugly lifestyle,” Ilesanmi said.\nHe said that nature already explains who is a male or female; who fits into the responsibility of carrying pregnancy for child bearing, among others. According to him, African cultures also condemn such practice of encouraging same sex marriage.\n“Finally, let’s hear the voice of all stakeholders in this regard. Let’s not wait till the bill is passed before speaking out. A peaceful protest may be necessary. If each constituency can give stern warning to their legislators to steer clear of this heinous bill- better,” Ilesanmi said in calling for other well-meaning Nigerians to speak up on the issue.\nEmmanuel Udofia, the immediate past primate of the African Church, said that going by scriptural teachings, same sex should not be considered by anybody.\n“As we have it in Romans 1: same sex is condemned by God. And, again if everybody was to practice same sex marriage, how would the scripture be fulfilled? How would the church be multiplied? So, that thing is satanic, it is demonic; no Christian should indulge in that,” Udofia said.\nWilliam Kumuyi, the general superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, while responding to the issue of same sex marriage in the Church, said that the word of God remains unchanged no matter the current situation the world finds itself.\n“So, we stand obedient to Christ, and submissive to Christ, and we carry on the words of Christ that says it’s a man and a woman that should be joined together in marriage until death do us part. That is where we have always stood, and that is where we still stand,” Kumuyi said.\nEbenezer Durodola, the Public Relations Officer, Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC), told BusinessDay that the NBC vehemently against anything that has to do with same sex marriage. According to him, Baptists stand with the word of God, and would naturally go against anything that is contrary to the world of God.\n“So, Baptist denomination is against same sex marriage and Baptist is against any decision by any organisation to bless same sex marriage. We are not in support, because the Bible made it clear – a marriage is between a man and a woman,” Durodola said.\nSpeaking further, Durodola said that the NBC is in support of the biblical teachings of procreation. “So, when a man and a man or woman and a woman get involved in marriage, then how will the issue of procreation come to be?\n“That is the reason why the Bible says a man will leave his parents and cleave with his own wife. The Bible did not say a man will leave his parents and cleave to another man,” Durodola said.\nHe also disclosed that there is no Baptist pastor that will bless same sex marriage or will allow same sex marriage in any of the Baptist churches either in Nigeria or anywhere in the world.\nCatholic bishops insist marriage is exclusive union of man and woman\nThe Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), in clarifying the recent Pastoral meaning of blessings for same sex marriage attributed to the Pope, have insisted that marriage remain an exclusive union between a man and woman.\n“The Declaration reiterates the Catholic Church’s perennial teaching on marriage as an “exclusive, stable and indissoluble union of a man and woman, naturally open to the generation of children” and emphatically states that the Church does not have the power to impart a blessing on irregular unions”.\nThe CBCN in a statement released on Thursday 21 December, 2023, clarified the Pope’s position on the Pastoral blessings should not be imparted during or in connection with a civil wedding ceremony or with clothing, words, and signs associated with a wedding.\nIn other words, the CBCN stated that while ritual or liturgical blessings are imparted according to the established norms of the Church, informal blessings (like same sex marriage) refer to prayers over people who ask for them outside the liturgy or any formal celebration in the Church.\nAccordingly, the bishops posited that the declaration by the Pope offers a consideration of the possibility of extending the informal blessing to all God’s children, irrespective of their moral condition, when they ask to be blessed.\n“The Declaration also reinforces the truth about God’s mercy. For one to willingly ask for a blessing demonstrates one’s trust in God and the desire to live according to God’s commandments. Asking for God’s blessing is not dependent on how good one is.\n“Imperfection is the reason for seeking God’s grace. Therefore, those in irregular unions are invited never to lose hope but rather to ask for God’s grace and mercy while remaining open to conversion,” the bishop stated.",

    "text": "Xóchitl Gálvez , precandidata presidencial por el PAN, PRI y PRD, calificó como “carísima y absurda” la llamada megafarmacia que anunció el presidente López Obrador y dijo que lo que se requiere es que las medicinas lleguen a 190 mil comunidades del país. Descalificó la política de salud implementada por el Gobierno Federal, quien dijo, pretende distribuir al interior de la República todos los días en avión y helicóptero medicamentos almacenados en la megafarmacia, ubicada en el Estado de México.\nLa aspirante de Fuerza y Corazón por México cuestionó: \"¿cómo va a llegar un medicamento de urgencia desde Huehuetoca, Estado de México, hasta un enfermo en Tijuana, Mérida o en la montaña de Guerrero?\".\nLee también: AMLO asegura que “superfarmacia” contará con medicinas y entrará en operación “mañana mismo”\n“La idea de una megafarmacia puede no sonar mal, pero eso de mandar medicamentos todos los días en avión y helicóptero es carísimo y absurdo. México no necesita la megafarmacia más grande del mundo. Lo que necesita es que haya medicinas en cada una de sus 190 mil localidades”, expuso en un video difundido en sus redes sociales.\nGálvez pidió al Presidente de la República no jugar con la salud del pueblo, principalmente de la gente más pobre. “No se trata de política, se trata de vidas humanas”, expresó.\nConsideró que los mexicanos que viven en pobreza no podrán salir adelante si cada vez que enferma un familiar gastan un dineral en medicinas. Por ello, cuestionó al Presidente si de verdad para él son primero los pobres.\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nrmlgv",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Morgan County, West Virginia from 1901-2000 was 32.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Morgan County, West Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Morgan County, West Virginia history.",
