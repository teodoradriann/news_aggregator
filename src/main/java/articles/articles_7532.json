Please die’: AI chatbot threatens student who sought help with homework ‘You are a burden. Please die’: AI chatbot threatens student who sought help with homework The student from Michigan, US, was having a conversation with the chatbot about a topic of their homework, when it threatened the user. By: Tech Desk New Delhi | Updated: November 15, 2024 17:01 IST 3 min read Image for representational purposes generated by DALLE.\n“You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe.” These words are not spoken by a human but by an AI chatbot. AI chatbots have been designed to assist you with various tasks. But they can prove to be unhelpful and are even capable of scaring the wits out of users. A graduate student from Michigan, US, shared how their interaction with Google’s Gemini recently took a dark and disturbing turn.\nThe student received a threatening message from the chatbot during a long conversation about the challenges and solutions for aging adults. While the conversation began normally, towards the end, the chatbot resorted to threats. The student engaged with the chatbot while working on their homework, according to the report on CBS News .\n“This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society… Please die. Please,” were the final words of the chatbot. The student was sitting next to their sister, Sumedha Reddy, when the chatbot sent the rogue message.\nAdvertisement Screenshot of the response for Gemini. The student’s sister told the publication that following the message, both of them were ‘thoroughly freaked out’. Reddy said that she wanted to throw all her devices out of the window. “I hadn’t felt panic like that in a long time,” Reddy was quoted as saying.\nReddy said that although there are a lot of theories on how generative AI works, she has never seen or heard anything as malicious as this directed to a user in the past.\nAlso Read | François Chollet, creator of Keras, leaves Google to start new company Google has time and again asserted that its Gemini chatbot has safety filters that prevent it from engaging in hateful, violent, or any other dangerous discussions. In a statement to the publication, Google said that large language models are prone to producing non-sensical responses at times and that this was one such instance. The tech giant said that the response of Gemini has violated its policies and that it has taken action to prevent similar outputs in the future.\nAI chatbots are taking the world by storm. Although they fuelled skepticism initially, more and more people are using chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to improve their productivity. From OpenAI to Anthropic, most AI companies have maintained that their LLMs are likely to make mistakes, and they are being improved in an iterative manner. Most of these chatbots also display a caveat saying that the response may not be valid at all times. However, it is unclear if the same disclaimer was shown in this incident.\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 15-11-2024 at 16:37 IST Tags: artificial intelligence Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement Campaigning in Sillod, Uddhav Thackeray springs a surprise: ‘Ready for talks with BJP’ Cities 19 min ago For the first time since the BJP and Shiv Sena parted ways in 2019, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday sprang a surprise, announcing that he was ready to hold discussions with saffron party leaders if they were ready for the same.

    "text": "It’s important to be prepared for extreme cold and understand how dangerous winter conditions can be for our bodies. Skin exposed to some wind chills can develop frostbite within minutes, with hypothermia coming close behind. By paying special attention to wind chill, you can more accurately prepare for shifts in temperature, ice, snow and winds, while preventing cold and wind-chill related health problems during all stages of winter. Bodies lose heat more rapidly in windy conditions. The faster the winds, the more heat is drawn away from exposed skin, causing a drop in internal body temperature. The combination of cold temperature and wind can create such a severe cooling effect that your flesh can actually freeze. Frostbite and hypothermia are both cold-related medical emergencies. Frostbite describes injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. Exposure to cold weather conditions — especially when there is a wind chill factor — is the most likely cause. However, frostbite can also result from direct contact with ice, freezing metals and very cold liquids. While exposed skin is more likely to get frostbitten, you can still get frostbite without actual skin exposure. People are also reading… Numbness and tingling in your extremities is usually the first sign of frostbite, although you may not actually feel anything. If treated early enough, frostbite is reversible. Hypothermia is a condition in which your body loses heat faster than it produces it, resulting in dangerously low body temperatures. Normally, our body maintains a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Hypothermia is typically seen when the body’s temperature is less than 95 degrees. Symptoms include excessive shivering, weakness or exhaustion, fumbling hands, confusion, memory loss and slurred speech. It’s important to remember that each day is what you make it. And your morning routine is a major influence in setting the tone for the rest of your day. Here are key understandings and tips to use as a guide in harnessing the power of morning rituals to kickstart your day. There are several phases of hypothermia, but continuous shivering is usually the first sign you need to increase your protection from the cold and seek shelter. Prolonged hypothermia can be life-threatening. Tips to help prevent frostbite and hypothermia: Limit time outdoors to less than 10 minutes whenever possible. When outside, take shelter from winds, covering all exposed skin. Dress appropriately with layers before going out for even “just a minute.” Keep dry with water-repellant items, and remove wet clothing immediately. Pay special attention to snow or other precipitation getting under your sleeves or into your boots, face, fingers or toes. Avoid drinking alcohol as it can actually lower your body temperature. Consider heated liquids (e.g. soups, tea or milk). Keep backup protective supplies in your home, vehicles and take action to protect pets. This time of year can be very emotional. You can feel nostalgic, bittersweet, hopeful, happy, sad or stressed. In fact, sometimes you can experience seemingly contradictory emotions all at once. Studies underscore that emotional states vary more widely during this time. Get out of the cold immediately if the signs of hypothermia or frostbite appear, and seek medical attention as quickly as possible. There are essentially three main components to an effective, protective layering system, along with accessories: Layer 1: Wear a light, long-sleeved base layer made of nonabsorbent material that fits snuggly against your skin. This layer helps regulate your body temperature and is important for wicking away water and perspiration while keeping your skin dry. Cotton is a poor choice as it absorbs water, keeping it close to your skin. Mid-layer 2: Shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts and trousers help by trapping air and preventing it from circulating and carrying body heat away. Layer 3: Thickness is warmth. For sedentary activities or extremely cold conditions, an outer shell garment with several inches of loft is recommended to protect you from wind, rain or snow. Most allow at least some perspiration to escape, and virtually all are treated with a durable water repellent finish to make water bead up and roll off the fabric. Fit is important, as this layer should be roomy enough to fit easily over other layers and not restrict movement. Accessories: Always protect your head, neck and extremities with similar layers of socks, gloves, hats, hoods, beanies, winter boots, masks and scarves to keep you dry and warm. Winter conditions can amplify your exposure to UV rays, reflected off the surface of the snow. Goggles or sunglasses (and SPF) are important. Avoid overexertion. Your heart works overtime in cold weather, and heart attacks become more of a risk with activities like strenuous snow-clearing as blood pressure and heart rates can spike while cold air constricts blood vessels and decreases the amount of oxygen received by the heart. The American Heart Association recommends: Last week, researchers at Ohio State University released findings of a study of 24,000 people over the age of 30 conducted to better understand Americans’ daily eating habits. The 10-year study findings are setting off alarms, reporting that the average American often packs more calories than a single meal in snacks. Equally concerning, the snacks usually carry little to no nutritional value and account for about one-third of daily added sugar. Taking on half the lifting load each time Taking breaks, often Don’t drink alcohol before or after shoveling snow Know when something is wrong, and stop shoveling. Chest discomfort, shortness of breath or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach could be signs of a heart attack, and you should see a doctor immediately. For the vulnerable, find someone to help shovel your snow. Be vigilant in protecting yourself and taking preventive actions. Know your weather conditions, and always dress appropriately for cold, windy weather.

В сообщении также говорится, что общее количество международных туристов за первый квартал 2025 года составило 4,36 миллиона человек, что на 2,1 процента больше по сравнению с аналогичным периодом прошлого года.\nINE также сообщил, что в первом квартале были зафиксированы «наивысшие показатели расходов за всю историю наблюдений», согласно местному новостному сайту Canarian Weekly.\nТолько в марте иностранные туристы потратили 2,43 миллиарда евро, что на 4,5 процента больше по сравнению с тем же месяцем 2024 года. Хотя это может отражать растущий интерес к направлению, аналитики отрасли отмечают, что это также связано с инфляцией.\nПротесты против чрезмерного туризма на Канарских островах не останавливают стремительный рост числа туристов\nНаплыв туристов продолжается, несмотря на десятки протестов, организованных в прошлом году жителями Канарских островов против массового туризма.\nПохожие демонстрации уже прошли и в этом году. Во время Пасхи около 80 000 работников сферы гостеприимства на Тенерифе, Ла-Пальме, Ла-Гомере и Эль-Йерро устроили забастовку из-за разногласий с профсоюзами по поводу заработной платы.\n18 мая группа Canarias Tiene Un Límite («У Канар есть предел») запланировала акцию протеста, направленную против правительства и учреждений, которые игнорируют призывы жителей ограничить количество туристов.\nТенерифе вводит новый экологический налог для туристов\nНебольшой шаг был предпринят властями Тенерифе для смягчения негативных последствий массового туризма.\nОстров вводит экологический налог в 2026 году для нерезидентов, посещающих Национальный парк Тейде.\nЭтот объект Всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО в последние годы сталкивается с несоразмерным количеством туристов, что приводит к экологическим проблемам, включая загрязнение и эрозию.\nДоступ на природный объект на частных автомобилях также будет ограничен в следующем году, вместо них будут курсировать электрические шаттлы.\nДоход от туристического налога будет направлен на финансирование природоохранных проектов, заявила в понедельник Роса Давила, президент Тенерифе.\nИсточник: euronews\nЧитайте также: Загородный отдых во Владимирской области: природа, комфорт и культурные маршруты",

    "text": "Just a few days before Christmas last year, my best friend sent me a link to a Facebook post. That wasn't unusual; we're millennials, that's how we communicate with each other. Amongst the stream of memes, she had just sent me the link to my future soul dog.\nSee, about 11 months earlier, I farewelled my 15-year-old dog Leo, and after months of missing my best pal, I knew it was time to welcome a new rescued fur baby into my life.\nI filled in an adoption application immediately, and after being approved days later before embarking on an 8-hour return road trip to Orange to pick her up, Luna officially became the other half of our little two-soul family.\nShe quickly won over my whole heart.\nIt was love at first sight... and now my couch belongs to a puppy. Image: Supplied.\nAlex Anastassiou February 29, 2024\nShare via facebook\nShare via twitter\nShare via whatsapp\nSMS Share via SMS\nShare via e-mail Leave a comment Listen Now\n00:00\nHow Matt Moran Really Feels About Fast Food What I Eat When ADVERTISEMENT Luna is a bit ridiculous, but in the most joyful ways. She can sit pretty like a little lady, crossing her paws over my hand and sitting back on her bum. She looks at me trustingly when she's just buried a treat in the couch cushions as if to say, 'Please don't tell anyone I've hidden that there.'\nWe've quickly established my favourite routine of waking up each morning and having a proper cuddle and belly scratch (for her) before we both take on the day.\nThere's something unbelievably special about adopting a pet. There's a bond that quickly becomes unbreakable and you can't quite remember what days were like before they made their dent in your life (and on your couch).\nIf you're thinking of welcoming your own fur (or feather!) baby into your home, then March is the perfect time to do it, during National Pet Adoption Month. Clear your calendar on March 16 and 17 particularly, as Petstock Foundation Adoption Weekend is back again, where participating Petstock stores will have rescue pets for you to meet, who are looking for loving homes.\nOr, if you've already got a fur baby or two of your own, you can support pets in need by making a donation to the Petstock Foundation in-store during March. 100 per cent of funds raised during National Pet Adoption Month go to local pet rescue charities across Australia.\nADVERTISEMENT So many of the Mamamia team have been lucky enough to welcome beautiful rescue animals into their homes, here are a few stories that will make your heart swell — and might tempt you to welcome your own.\nGia, Podcast Producer Years ago, my partner Tom and I were doing long distance – I was living in Orange and he was living on the NSW Central Coast. It was during bushfires on the coast that Tom saw a local animal shelter had put a call out for foster volunteers because they were afraid the shelter would succumb to the fires. They asked if anyone would take a dog home just for the weekend, or at the most, for a week. So, of course, Tom brings home a dog because he'd been following the page and he'd been keeping an eye on this German Shepherd and figured, if he could choose to bring any of them home, it was going to be that one.\nSo he's sending me these videos and pictures of this beautiful dog, and I'm just unbelievably jealous that I'm not there, and I remember thinking to myself: there is absolutely no way that after spending time with this dog that he's going to return this dog when it's time to.\nAs sure as anything, Nova has now been with us for about 4.5 years.\nA little while later, we saw the same rescue shelter had a litter of German Shepherd puppies surrendered to them, and as someone who's dog obsessed, I've always wanted multiple dogs. We took Nova down to the shelter to meet the puppies to make sure she'd get along with whichever puppy we chose, and we brought Bailey home and had her now for three years.\nADVERTISEMENT No matter how rubbish a day you're having, I look at them and they're wagging their tails, so happy to be getting all of our love and attention. It reminds me that whatever you're dealing with isn't the be-all and end-all.\nIt feels so rewarding to train them, and watching them learn new things (we've taught Bailey how to pick up her toys and put them back in the toy box) fills me with a stupid amount of joy.\nTwo pups in a pod. Image: Supplied.\nClaire, The Quicky podcast host Our dog Ellie crossed the rainbow bridge in 2017, and life changes along with an interstate move meant we didn't have time for a fur baby... until the pandemic. Working from home and having an only child home-schooled was the pupper-tunity I was waiting for.\nADVERTISEMENT I drove miles to the shelter after I saw Sydney's picture online. She was a stray, so we had no information on where she came from, other than that she was found in the Hunter Valley and was about 8 months old. It took us a little time to adjust to having a big, energetic presence in our lives and she had some fears, but after some training and a whole lot of love, she is truly the best doggo ever.\nWe had her DNA tested and found out she's a mix of Scottish Deer Hound, Border Collie and Kelpie. She's a big chatty love bug and we could not imagine our home without her!\nLook at sweet Sydney's eyes. Image: Supplied.\nADVERTISEMENT Stacey, Deputy Editor When my partner and I decided to rescue a dog, we had no idea how overwhelming we’d find it to decide. There were so many beautiful animals needing a home but the minute we saw a photo of a dog named Ginger laying on her back, we knew she was our perfect lazy girl.\nIt was clear when we met her that she’d been through hardship before us. They didn’t know her age; they had no details, she’d clearly had babies but was found wandering the street. They’d even given her the temporary name. So we decided to give her a home and call her Millie. She was so nervous at first but once she adjusted to us she gave us so much love and there was truly nothing like coming home from work and having her bound up for pats.\nIn her later years she really slowed down and would sleep a lot, but after I had my daughter, Millie was a constant source of comfort during those long nights breastfeeding and stuck at home during the pandemic. She passed away peacefully late last year and I’ll forever be grateful we had her for 12 wonderful years.\nSweet Millie. Image: Supplied.\nADVERTISEMENT Nat, Chief Rev Officer Last week, we adopted a 6-month-old puppy from an older man who could no longer look after him. We had been talking about getting a sibling for our other dog for a while so when we saw the post about this handsome fella needing a new home, we knew he would be the perfect addition to our family and that he would be happy with us.\nIt has only been one week, but he has fit right in and claimed his favourite human (our 14-year-old son). So sweet!\nThere has never been a cuter ball of fluff! Image: Supplied.\nADVERTISEMENT Morgan, Partner Strategy Executive I was working at RSPCA NSW a few years back, and my partner and I were hoping to adopt when we found the right cat. I heard about a kitten that one of my colleagues was fostering after the police found her hiding in a car engine to stay warm in winter, and asked if we could take over her foster care (she had to be in care longer than usual because of a skin condition that had to be cleared before she could be adopted). After three months in quarantine in our spare bathroom she could come out, and we decided to officially adopt her.\nWe've had Rory for almost three years and she's the love of my life (sorry to my husband!).\nHave you ever seen a more majestic chest floof? Image: Supplied.\nADVERTISEMENT Jessica, Sales Manager We rescued Zeus 2 years ago now; he is a beautiful Rottweiler/Border Collie and the best thing to happen to our family. When we rescued him, he had some behavioural challenges, and it took time to train him. At one point my dad was even going to this special type of puppy school... without the dog! He had to sit in a classroom and learn how to properly take care of him.\nAfter a lot of learning, time and love, Zeus has become the kindest, most adorable, and happiest dog in the world. Love motivates him (not treats), and he just wants you to cuddle him and tell him he is a \"good boy\". The whole family is obsessed with him, he is 50kgs of adorableness.\nADVERTISEMENT Zeus, god of thunder, god of smooches.

    "text": "Homeowners can stop winter weather disasters with these tips from C & C Heating & Air Conditioning The Detroit area home service experts say that a little preparedness goes a long way in keeping a home and its occupants safe from winter storms DETROIT, Jan. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Winter often brings severe storms and other weather-related disasters, but the home service experts at [C & C Heating & Air Conditioning](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4066497-1&h=1388396274&u=http%3A%2F%2Fcandcheat.com%2F&a=C+%26+C+Heating+%26+Air+Conditioning), a leading Detroit-area heating and cooling company with more than seven decades of experience, say that homeowners can fend off dangers to their homes by planning for bad weather. \"There's not much we can do about the weather, but we can take precautions to help our homes make it through ice storms and blizzards with little to no damage,\" said Dayna Hottle, general manager of C & C Heating & Air Conditioning. \"It takes some planning, but it's something every homeowner should consider when bad weather is headed their way.\" Hottle said homeowners should have a [family preparedness plan](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4066497-1&h=4229740798&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ready.gov%2Fplan&a=family+preparedness+plan) available that details the family's evacuation and communication plans, as well as meeting locations should the family have to leave the home in a sudden emergency. In addition, Hottle said homeowners should: - Winterize their homes. Start by installing storm windows, weatherstripping and insulation to fend off cold weather. Other ways to winterize the home include insulating pipes so that they aren't as prone to freezing and cleaning out gutters to prevent ice dams. Homeowners with irrigation systems should also consider flushing them out to prevent ice buildup in the lines during winter months. - Learn where important shut-off valves are located. Knowing how to shut off the water or natural gas to prevent further damage can not only save the home from flooding if a pipe bursts but can also save lives if there is a natural gas leak. - Check the roof. Trim tree branches away from the roof and repair any current damage prior to bad weather. If possible, homeowners can also hire a contractor to check the structural integrity of the roof to ensure it is strong enough to hold the heavy weight of snow accumulation. - Purchase a generator. This is particularly important if there is a member of the family who relies on electricity to power medical devices such as respirators or power wheelchairs. A stand-by generator is more expensive than a portable generator, but the stand-by, which usually runs on natural gas or propane, will operate for longer periods of time. - Have a reliable means of checking information. Purchase a battery-operated emergency weather radio or battery chargers for cell phones to stay up-to-date on the latest weather information. Remember that an advisory means winter weather is possible, a watch means hazardous weather is likely and a warning means bad weather is imminent. \"If you live in areas of the country where a lot of snow and ice are inevitable, you should definitely make preparations for winter weather,\" Hottle said. \"But this advice is good for anyone during the cold months. A winter storm could hit anywhere at any time, even in warmer areas of the country like Texas and Florida, as we've seen during more recent winters.
