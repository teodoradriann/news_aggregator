    "text": "Port Hueneme residents try to stay afloat following disastrous storms\nPORT HUENEME, Calif.—Luz Rodriguez has lost everything following the flooding from last week’s storm.\n“I've gone through whatever savings I had to pay for all this stuff. I have no money left,” said Rodriguez, who lives in Hueneme Bay.\nThe flooding, which followed a record level of rainfall in the area, destroyed cars, garages, and homes.\nResidents like Rodriguez are scrambling to mitigate further damage and mold by removing wet flooring and damaged walls.\n“The longer we sit in this and leave it, the more damage, the more is going to get out of control. So I'm been working day in, day out,” said Rodriguez.\nIn senior communities like Hueneme Bay where many people are evacuated, residents are left vulnerable to looting and burglary, but Luz says safety is the least of her worries.\n“If they break in, they break in. I mean, you know, where they can take everything is a loss as far as I'm concerned. I mean, I'm happy that I got my truck and I have my life. So I thank God for that. But as far as everything else, it's all gone,” said Rodriguez.\nStill, Port Hueneme Police Department is ramping up efforts to keep people safe. They’ve stepped up patrols not just with officers, but also with traffic enforcement, detectives, and administrative personnel utilizing both marked and unmarked vehicles.\nThey are already making progress after several reports came in regarding suspicious behavior.\nMike Federico, Chief of Police, Port Hueneme\n“There was one individual that the police officers and we arrested him on Christmas morning who is now being tied to several events that occurred in one neighborhood. We're tying that together with both video and eyewitness statements,” said Chief of Police for Port Hueneme Police Department Mike Federico.\nThe police department is urging residents to report any suspicious behavior.\nThe city also says it’s critical for residents to report all property and vehicle damages to Ventura county emergency services.\nThe website for that is www.vcemergency.com",

    "text": "UN plans to add nutrients to second round of Gaza polio vaccinations UNICEF says it will add essential vitamins and minerals to the second round of polio vaccinations in Gaza, adding there might also be further vaccinations added to the campaign. The second round of a vaccination campaign to protect 640,000 children in Gaza against polio will also deliver micronutrients - essential vitamins and minerals - and conduct nutritional screening, a senior UN Children's Fund official said. Discussions are also under way about the feasibility of adding further vaccinations to the campaign, including measles immunisation, said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director for humanitarian action and supply operations. \"There are over 44,000 children born in the last year and who haven't received their basic immunisation,\" he said on Thursday. The first round of the polio vaccination campaign, which began on September 1, reached its target of 90 percent of children under 10 years of age, the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Monday. It was carried out in phases over two weeks during humanitarian pauses in the fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas fighters. A second round of the polio vaccinations has to be carried out within four weeks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed last month that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. A high risk of famine persists across Gaza as long as the war continues and humanitarian access is restricted, according to an assessment by a global hunger monitor published in June. \"In the same way that we've been able to reach all children with polio vaccines, we need to move and use the same modality to reach children with their basic vaccines, with some of the nutrition and hygiene interventions that are essential to save their lives,\" Chaiban told reporters after visiting Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Israel. \"Those are lifesaving interventions and the parties have shown that they can line up when necessary. It needs to happen again,\" he said.",

    "text": "The Bolivian government had intelligence that a coup attempt could occur before the country’s top military commander and his troops forced their way into the presidential palace this week, a senior government minister said on Thursday.\nThe failed coup on Wednesday happened over just a few hours and provoked swift condemnations from world leaders, raising fears that democracy in the Andean nation remains at risk.\nIn an interview with Bolivian broadcaster Unitel, Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo said that President Luis Arce received reports about “destabilization attempts,” though he cautioned that the government did not know more at the time.\nThe mobilization of military units on Wednesday saw the country’s military commander gather troops in the main square of capital La Paz, ramming a palace door with an armored vehicle to allow soldiers to rush into the building.\nThe soldiers ultimately withdrew and police regained control of the square, with Arce slamming the coup attempt and swiftly naming a new top general.\nThe former commander, Juan Jose Zuniga, was arrested as well as former Navy commander Juan Arnez Salvador, del Castillo said. He later explained that 17 people had been detained so far, but there were “many more who had participated.”\nDuring a Thursday morning session of the Organization of American States (OAS) held in Paraguay, Bolivia’s ambassador said around 200 military officers took part in the short-lived operation led by Zuniga.\nElsewhere, calls for accountability for the attempted coup grew louder.\n“I urge the authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of violence and reports of injuries,” said U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Turk. “Those responsible must be held to account.”\nZuniga had recently said that Arce’s former mentor-turned-political-rival, ex-President Evo Morales, should not be able to run again for president and threatened to block him if he attempted to do so.\nThe commander had been told on Tuesday evening that he would be stripped of his position as his conduct “was not in line with the Constitution,” according to del Castillo.\nHe recalled that Zuniga reacted calmly to the news.\n“But no one could have imagined that the next day, before the official handover in posts, there would be a failed coup in our country,” he said.\nLate Wednesday, Minister of the Presidency Maria Nela Prada told reporters that Zuniga, in his confession to police, said the coup attempt failed because reinforcements did not arrive in time.\nAs he was being arrested, Zuniga said that he had been instructed to carry out the coup at Arce’s direction in order to boost the president’s popularity, which Prada later denied.",

    "text": "Oceaneering International, Inc. (\"Oceaneering\") ( NYSE: OII ) today reported first quarter 2025 results.\nRevenue of $675 million, a 13% increase year over year Operating income of $73.5 million, a 100% increase year over year Net income of $50.4 million, a 233% increase year over year Adjusted EBITDA of $96.7 million, a 57% increase year over year, which has not been adjusted for a $10.4 million inventory reserve taken in our Manufactured Products segment Cash flow used in operating activities of $(80.7) million and free cash flow of $(107) million, with an ending cash position of $382 million Share repurchases of 479,154 for approximately $10.0 million Rod Larson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oceaneering, stated, \"Oceaneering outperformed expectations this quarter due to resilient utilization of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and strong vessel activity predominately in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $96.7 million, exceeding both our guidance range and consensus estimates for the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, our consolidated first quarter 2025 operating income doubled on a 13% increase in revenue, driven by strong performances from our Subsea Robotics (SSR) and Offshore Projects Group (OPG) segments. In addition, our Aerospace and Defense Technologies (ADTech) segment was awarded the largest initial contract in Oceaneering's history, which is foundational to our 2025 guidance for significant growth in this segment. On behalf of our leadership team, I want to thank our Oceaneers worldwide who made these results possible.\"\nUpdated 2025 guidance\nMr. Larson continued, \"We reiterate our prior full-year 2025 guidance of EBITDA in the range of $380 million to $430 million. As discussed during our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call, we lowered the bottom end of our guidance range to $380 million, in acknowledgment of potential market uncertainties. Given our strong start to 2025, we still believe this range is appropriate, even with recent market developments.\"\nFull-year 2025 consolidated and segment guidance remains the same as provided in the fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and call, with the addition that the Manufactured Products book-to-bill ratio is expected to be in the range of 0.9 to 1.0 for the full year.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Segment Results\nAs compared to the first quarter of 2024:\nSSR operating income improved 35% to $59.6 million on a 10% increase in revenue. EBITDA margin expanded to 35%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 413 basis points. ROV fleet utilization was 67% and ROV revenue per day utilized was $10,788, reflecting year-over-year improvements. Manufactured Products operating income of $8.7 million declined 34% on a 4% increase in revenue, with operating income margin declining year over year to 6%. These results were impacted by a $10.4 million adjustment taken during the quarter related to an inventory reserve associated with our theme park ride business. Backlog was $543 million on March 31, 2025, a 9% decrease compared with the same period in 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.90 for the 12-month period ending on March 31, 2025. OPG results improved significantly year over year, due to the continuation of international projects that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2024, improved vessel utilization in the Gulf of Mexico, and the reduction in drydock costs and the associated loss of vessel days that impacted the first quarter of 2024. Operating income grew to $35.7 million, revenue increased to $165 million, and operating income margin expanded to 22%. Integrity Management and Digital Solutions (IMDS) operating income of $3.5 million, operating income margin of 5%, and revenue of $71.4 million were relatively flat. ADTech revenue was relatively flat at $97.2 million. Operating income decreased $2.1 million to $10.7 million and operating income margin declined to 11%, due to readiness costs to enable our role as a prime contractor on the recently announced large contract award. At the corporate level, Unallocated Expenses of $44.6 million were in line with guidance for the quarter. Second Quarter 2025 Guidance\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2024, consolidated second quarter 2025 revenue is expected to increase and EBITDA is projected to increase to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million.\nAt the segment level, for the second quarter of 2025, as compared to the second quarter of 2024:\nSSR revenue and operating profitability are expected to increase. Manufactured Products revenue is projected to be relatively flat and operating profitability is expected to improve. OPG revenue is forecasted to be relatively flat and operating profitability is forecast to improve significantly. IMDS revenue is expected to be relatively flat and operating profitability is expected to improve. ADTech revenue is projected to increase and operating profitability is projected to improve significantly. Unallocated Expenses are expected to be in the $45 million range. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and on a segment basis (as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins); and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impacts of certain identified items. Reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP measures are shown in the tables Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share (EPS), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and Margins, Free Cash Flow, 2025 Consolidated EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Estimates, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and Margins by Segment.

We have included Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share, each of which excludes the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. As a result, these amounts are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these are useful measures for investors to review because they provide consistent measures of the underlying results of our ongoing business. Furthermore, our management uses these measures as measures of the performance of our operations. We have also included disclosures of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), EBITDA Margins, 2024 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, and 2025 Consolidated EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Estimates, as well as the following by segment: EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins and related information by segment exclude the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. Due to the forward-looking nature of EBITDA for the second quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2025, we cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary line-items for the reconciliations to net income and, accordingly, have excluded such line-items in the reconciliation. EBITDA and EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins, and related information by segment are each non-GAAP financial measures. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by operating activities less organic capital expenditures ( i.e ., purchases of property and equipment other than those in business acquisitions). We have included these disclosures in this press release because EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, and Free Cash Flow are widely used by investors for valuation purposes and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies in our industry, and the adjusted amounts thereof provide more consistent measures than the unadjusted amounts. Furthermore, our management uses these measures for purposes of evaluating our financial performance. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, and Free Cash Flow (and the Adjusted amounts thereof) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as substitutes for our reported operating results, cash flows, or any other measure prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. The tables that follow provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP FINANCIAL

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA - December 28, 2023 - “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest. And most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. Where to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God. Dr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org Most of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct quotes from the Real Reality, and this is one such quote pertaining to war: \"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals … All the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?” And this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer: “Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\" The question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace. Dr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org). An example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website: \"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\" Media Contact Company Name: Ascot Media Group, Inc.

[Why trust us?](/extras/indybest/indybest-about-us-who-team-experts-how-test-review-products-b2229694.html) Fend off the chill this season with outwear that won’t compromise on style Whether there’s a light breeze or icy gales, finding the right coat at this time of year is on the top of most men’s wardrobe priority list. We all know the British weather, particularly during the winter, can be downright nightmarish, so wrapping up warm with a winter jacket or coat is essential. Whether you’re looking for a hardy down jacket from the likes of The North Face or lighter layers in the form of fleecy designs from New Look and Gramicci, we’ve found the best men’s winter coats for 2024. That’s not all, though, we’ve tried and tested styles to suit more formal outfits, including wool overcoats and warm blazers that keep the chill at bay. Choosing outerwear is an important decision because it completes an outfit during autumn and winter and it’s often the first piece that people see you in, so needs to be harmonious with your wardrobe and also practical. Keep reading for our pick of some of the best men’s coats and winter jackets that you’ll be reaching for throughout the chillier seasons. We have worn these coats through rain and wind, and, as the days got colder, we put them all to the test. We checked whether they kept us warm, made sure the price point was factored in and also assessed how well they fit into our winter wardrobe – do they go with our outfits? Are they practical for the office? We made sure we have included pieces that will work for an evening out, formal occasions, the office and pieces that will be the perfect companion during winter walks. Uniqlo is one of our favourite high street brands for its consistently high quality. The versatile coat is affordable and has kept us warm as the weather cools down. The classic style is easy to throw on over a casual outfit but works equally as well when completing an office or event look. Depending on your style, it comes in three different colourways. We opted for the navy, which is very dark, almost black in person. If this coat is like the other Uniqlo pieces we’ve tried, it will last for years and have a low cost per wear. The back vent is convenient for sitting down and lends stylish movement to the overall look. It’s made from a wool and polyester blend that provides warmth and a silky polyester lining for comfort. This is an oversized style with a drop shoulder. If you’re not into spending up to a grand on a genuine leather shearling jacket but want to get the look, this faux shearling aviator from New Look could be just the piece. The fluffy lining makes for a warm and comfortable option to throw on when the weather is nippy. We loved the look with the colour popped for neck warmth paired with an all black outfit. It is a regular fit but the furry lining had us sizing up for a bit of extra movement. Originating in California in the early 1980s, Gramicci has become a well-loved brand for outdoor clothing. The fleece jacket is now a menswear staple, having shrugged off its previously uncool image and Gramicci’s sherpa jacket is a wise choice to add to your wardrobe. We went for the natural colour, a cream with blue accents that we found ourselves using for trips to the shop, travelling in comfort on the train and lounging around the house too. The fleece is unlined so this is best used in conjunction with a thick knit for a colder day, but works perfectly during transitional periods between seasons and warmer winter days. We struggled choosing a colour as the five options are unique and enticing, with two patterned options and three solid colours. Natural and midnight navy will be the most versatile but for a pop of colour try the dusted lime or agate olive. Another great jacket that treads the line between formal and casual, this blazer from British brand Wax London is the perfect oversized fit. The chalk line pinstripe is a lovely detail against the brown woolly texture. Details that we love include the back vent, buttons on the sleeves that can be undone for a relaxed look, nice functional pockets and the double breast which creates movement when left open. It’s roomy enough to fit a thick jumper underneath on colder days and our tester loved creating unexpected looks, pairing loafers and vintage jeans with the blazer or a graphic tee underneath. A household name for outerwear, The North Face has firmly marked its place as a leader in high-quality puffer jackets. The 90s classic silhouette has been brought back with the nuptse jacket, but this time it’s made from recycled nylon and responsibly sourced down to insulate. The jacket kept us very snug and warm on colder days and will be the perfect lightweight and comfortable choice throughout the cold months. The oversized, boxy fit is perfect for our tester’s style and he found it so easy to pair with his outfits. The stowable hood is great for unexpected British weather changes and the whole thing can collapse into the right hand pocket. The waist is adjustable to keep draughts out too. The jacket comes in lots of different colours too. Rains has a range of jackets for protection against cold and rain, the familiar friends of British wintertime. This liner jacket is the perfect piece to layer under a heavy coat for extra warmth as it is minimal, fitted and cropped to keep concealed under your heavier winter coat. This is also a great option for running errands on a milder day. Use for heading to the gym, post office or over a jumper for after work drinks. This bomber shields against light rain and cold breezes and is lightweight and breathable. It attaches to Rains’ other jackets as an extra insulation layer. Concealed zip pockets are great for keeping your keys and cards safe. Giant coats are a huge trend for autumn and winter, and this coat is certainly oversized. Made with a wool blend, this coat is heavy and warm, and we really felt protected against biting winds. The double breasted front and notch collar created a tailored look that will smarten up a casual outfit. Details we loved include the button detailing on the sleeves and back vent for extra movement. The design makes this coat look more expensive than it is: which is a very reasonable £75. Go for sleek black trousers and some trainers for a smart casual outfit. Cuddly coats are in. You no longer have to sacrifice comfort for your winter coat with this AllSaints piece. The coat is super thick and soft and completely envelopes you for maximum cosiness. For the full teddy bear aesthetic, opt for the toffee brown colour. Sizing is true to size but opt for a larger size for ultra cosy vibes. Wear a slightly smarter outfit for an unexpected contrast or go full joggers and trainers with your cosy coat. You simply cannot go wrong with a puffer jacket – and Columbia’s really nailed it with this design, which is to be expected from a brand that has been creating outdoor gear since the Thirties. Having trailed this in various conditions – cold, crisp days, sub-zero mornings and damp, rainy afternoons – we’re very impressed with its performance. The water-resistant fabric meant we remained dry during a sudden downpour and we found the thick insulation great at trapping in the warmth, plus the hood was a much-appreciated feature. The teeming jacket from Mackintosh is a beautifully crafted quilted jacket in a relaxed cut. The corduroy colour is a lovely detail that contrasts with the dark wool in this colourway. There are chunky metal toggles to adjust the waistline at the hem in the same chrome colour as the pop buttons, which make the jacket feel easy to throw on and dash into the winter weather. We found this jacket to be really warm and oversized enough to fit thick jumpers underneath, essential for the cold winter days. This jacket comes in a range of colours with both wool and nylon shells in a variety of colours. Another great puffer option comes from sustainable brand Everlane. The renew short puffer is made with 100% recycled fabric and filled with recycled down feathers that have been repurposed from old pillows and duvets. This ultra warm puffer has kept us toasty for weeks and the contrast materials elevate the jacket. There is a big chest pocket and detachable hood that zips straight off. The jacket comes in two colours: black and green. If you want to invest in a warm, down-filled coat that will last you years, the North Face puffer coat is a great one to go for: it’s lightweight, packable and great for insulation during the cold winter days. For something more affordable, our best budget buy is New Look’s faux shearling jacket , for its cosy lined inners and stylish sleek black style, or opt for our affordable overcoat option, the Asos Design oversized wool mix coat .

    "text": "Arteta classifica derrota do Arsenal como \"decepcionante\" e despista sobre novos reforços\nNesta quinta-feira, o Arsenal desperdiçou a chance de reassumir a liderança da Premier League. Pela 19ª rodada, os Gunners foram derrotados pelo West Ham, em casa, por 2 a 0. Os mandantes acumularam 30 finalizações contra o adversário, e, por isso, o técnico Mikel Arteta classificou o resultado como \"decepcionante\".\n\"Quero parabenizar o West Ham e elogiar meus jogadores, é só isso que posso dizer. Isso é o futebol. Você vê o que fizemos durante o jogo, como criamos… e o resultado é decepcionante, mas eles foram melhores que nós em ambas as áreas. Eles tiveram dois chutes no gol, três se contar o pênalti, e nós tivemos 30\", afirmou o espanhol em coletiva pós-jogo.\nArteta ainda complementou: \"No futebol, você precisa fazer isso melhor (finalizar) se quiser vencer. Hoje, não ganhamos por conta disso. De resto, o time continuou tentando e teve uma ótima atitude novamente\".\nO comandante dos Gunners também disse que acredita que a má fase do ataque não esteja relacionada à falta de confiança dos atletas. \"Você chuta na trave, ou você finaliza e a bola não entra por meio centímetro, ou alguém bloqueia o chute e a bola não entra. Também perdemos muitas oportunidades na escolha do último passe. Isso faz a diferença para vencer os jogos\".\nQuando questionado se o Arsenal iria atrás de algum jogador para resolver os problemas de conversão de chances, o treinador despistou e deixou claro que está feliz com o elenco que tem em mãos.\n\"O que temos são estes jogadores, e são estes atletas que eu amo muito. O que temos que fazer é nos colocarmos em situações melhores e treinar mais. Temos que colocá-los lá e aumentar a confiança deles, porque eles já fizeram grandes coisas\", concluiu.\nO Arsenal foi ultrapassado pelo Liverpool, que venceu e alcançou 42 pontos no Inglês. Com 40, o time de Londres terminou a rodada na segunda colocação. O próximo desafio da equipe de Arteta será neste domingo, às 11 horas (de Brasília), contra o Fulham, em Craven Cottage.\n💬 \"We have to learn from it and make sure we get sharper and better in front of the goals.\"\nOur skipper on the missed chances tonight 👇\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal)\n[December 29, 2023]",
