    "text": "ELYRIA, Ohio (WOIO)- The Lorain County Health Department is taking a unique approach to combat illegal dumping with its new Nuisance Abatement Program. “Not only the debris that’s out here, but the public health issues also that exist,” says Mark Adams, Lorain County Public Health Commissioner. Adams is leading the charge against the growing problem of illegal dumping sites. The program partners with the municipal court to provide community service workers with double credit for their time cleaning up these sites. “The trailer I’m standing in was dumped here and then people proceeded to fill it with garbage and debris,” reports 19 News reporter Gabby Hart. “Mark tells me if it wasn’t for programs like the one we’re showing you, a lot of this would continue to sit here and fester, posing a hazard to the community.” “We’ve already taken 139 tires out of here... thousands of mosquitoes can live in those tires,” says Adams. “This is what mice do. This is why we clean things up. Mice spread disease, and it’s just been infested with mice and rats.” He continued. This site in Elyria is just one of hundreds. Trip after trip, load after load, crews are working to eliminate these health hazards. Adams believes this program could be a model for other communities struggling with illegal dumping. “That way we can make it clean in the communities and bring that pride back and say, ‘Hey, the government’s here to help,’” Adams says. The Lorain County Health Department encourages residents to dispose of trash responsibly through recycling centers or trash services. Copyright 2024 WOIO. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "IDC debuts AI-fueled software procurement analysis service - SiliconANGLE",
    "text": "Market research firm International Data Corp. today is releasing a new application aimed at helping enterprise executives simplify the software procurement process.\nIDC TechMatch uses generative artificial intelligence and IDC’s database of information about products and vendors to enable buyers to narrow buying criteria, evaluate vendors according to weighted preferences and generate draft requests for proposal.\n“One of the top pain points many CIOs cite is their process for selecting and purchasing software, which they describe as long, slow, complex and biased,” said Jim Spare, senior vice president and general manager of TechMatch. “This is an area we understand pretty well. Unbiased data presented when CIOs need it and in the way they need it can be a significant business opportunity.”\nTechMatch currently covers about 30 software categories but will quickly expand to more than 100 segments, Spare said. It leverages IDC’s research methodology called MarketScapes, which collects data from vendors on an ongoing basis. “It’s an always-on collection method; we have hundreds of MarketScapes available,” Spare said.\nUsers can investigate individual vendors and products and select multiple vendors within categories using weighting criteria ranging from inactive to critical. They can query the database in natural language and specify requirements that aren’t included in IDC’s research for direct response by vendors. IDC uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model and will support others in the future, executives said.\nAutomated RFPs RFPs are typically situation-dependent but with enough similarities between them that the process can be at least partially automated, said Adam Harris, vice president of digital product management.\n“For each of the markets we cover, we have a base set of information that is always valuable,” he said. “As you work through the platform and set requirements, we purposely put them inside of your RFP and suggest requirements you didn’t collect but might want to consider.”\nVendors can access and comment on the data IDC collects but can’t currently change any information. Users can grant selective access to buying committee colleagues. Each customer has a dedicated environment for security and privacy purposes and only anonymized customer data will be used in training, Harris said.\nCompanies don’t have to subscribe to IDC research to use TechMatch. The software is licensed on a sitewide basis with graduated pricing that “enables even small and midsized organizations to access the platform,” Spare said, without providing specifics.\nHe said early experience has shown that shared access to the service has collateral benefits.\n“In many organizations, there are software sourcing processes that are sanctioned by the IT organization and there are also people purchasing on their own outside the process,” he said. “By having a central place for coordinate purchases, CIOs can direct everybody to go through this platform. They have visibility into everything going on in the company related to software sourcing instead of myriad spreadsheets and web research.”\nPhoto: Pexels /Pixabay",

    "text": "„Let’s Dance“-Star muss RTL-Show verlassen – wer jetzt für sie einspringt\nDie Live-Shows von „Let’s Dance“ gehen nach Ostern in die nächste Runde. Doch für eine Kandidatin ist hier Endstation.\nKöln – Nach Folge sieben der RTL-Show „Let’s Dance“ verabschiedeten sich die Kandidaten und Profitänzer in eine kleine Osterpause. Ausgeruht und gestärkt geht es am Freitag (25. April) mit der nächsten Show weiter. Aber für eine Teilnehmerin ist die „Let’s Dance“-Reise unerwartet vorbei. Für einen Ersatz ist allerdings gesorgt.\nWegen Knieschmerzen: Sie muss „Let’s Dance“ verlassen\nIm Laufe der diesjährigen „Let’s Dance“-Staffel gab es schon einige Krankheitsausfälle. Das war aber nie so gravierend, dass es das komplette Show-Aus für den jeweiligen Kandidaten bedeutete. Eine Promi-Dame hat jetzt etwas weniger Glück und muss die RTL-Erfolgssendung, gemeinsam mit ihrem Tanzpartner verlassen, wie rtl.de jetzt verkündet. Die Rede ist von Schauspielerin Simone Thomalla (60) und Profitänzer Evgeny Vinokurov (34).\nBereits in der letzten Live-Show hatte Simone Thomalla mit Knieschmerzen zu kämpfen. Leider macht ihr das Knie immer noch Probleme, weshalb die Schauspielerin ihre Tanzschuhe an den Nagel hängen muss. Auch „Let’s Dance“-Fans sind traurig über das Aus von Simone Thomalla. „Sehr schade, aber Gesundheit geht vor!“, schreibt eine Zuschauerin auf Instagram, während ein weiterer Kommentar lautet: „Ich wünsche dir von Herzen gute Besserung und dass es deinem Knie ganz bald wieder besser geht. Und danke, für die schöne ‚Let’s Dance‘-Reise.“\nFans zwiegespalten: Diese Schauspielerin kehrt zu „Let’s Dance“ zurück\nMit dem „Let’s Dance“-Aus von Simone Thomalla verkündet RTL gleichzeitig, wer am Freitag wieder über das RTL-Tanzparkett wirbeln wird: Christine Neubauer (62) und ihr Tanzpartner Valentin Lusin (38) kehren zurück. Das Duo musste in der siebten Runde die Heimreise antreten, doch nun gibt es ein Comeback. Und was sagen die Fans dazu? Sie reagieren etwas gespalten. „Christine hat gut getanzt. Ich freue mich auf sie“, schwärmt eine Zuschauerin, aber jemand anderes findet: „Über die Rückkehr von Christine kann ich mich null freuen. Diese Frau ist einfach drüber.“\nDie Jury konnte Christine Neubauer mit ihrer tänzerischen Leistung stets überzeugen. Ob die Schauspielerin mit ihrer „Let’s Dance“-Rückkehr jetzt die Chance hat, ihr besonderes Ziel zu erreichen? Verwendete Quellen: rtl.de, Instagram/letsdance",

    "title": "The Skanner News - Burn Ban Lifted in the City of Portland",
    "text": "The burn ban that was issued in early July in the City of Portland has been lifted by the Fire Marshal effective immediately. Although the burn ban is being lifted, Portland Fire & Rescue would like to remind folks to only burn dried cordwood in a controlled setting by using a fire ring or elevated fire pit with an active hose line stretched to the location of your fire. Keep all flame lengths less than 24” and be certain to be a safe distance away from any structure and significant vegetation. In addition to the safety concerns with recreational fire pits, PF&R would like you to remain vigilant in your outdoor cooking activities as well. Residents are reminded to use extreme caution when using an outdoor cooking set up with open flame. When using charcoal briquettes, please properly dispose of the ashes in a covered metal container away from combustibles, and keep the ashes wet for a few days before properly disposing of them. Maintain at least ten feet between outdoor cooking and anything combustible such as siding, fences, shrubbery, etc. Ensure all cigarettes/cigars are extinguished prior to disposal. Those living in rural areas are asked to continue to maintain their defensible space by monitoring growth surrounding homes and structures as there is still a wildfire risk posed in our region, and to maintain adequate access for firefighting equipment in the event there is a response need. Contact Portland Fire & Rescue 503-823-3700 for additional information.",

    "text": "While tying up your little brother on an electric chair may be fun for Wednesday Addams, other kids need something less dangerous (but just as spooky!) to play with instead. Hey, sometimes a new toy is the best way to distract your kids from torturing each other! If you are looking for a toy that’s “creepy and kooky” to play with this Halloween, then you have to check out The Addams Family new toy collaboration with Polly Pocket . It’s frightfully cute!\nMorticia, Gomez, Wednesday, and Pugsley Addams are all included in The Addams Family x Polly Pocket compact , designed in miniature like the ‘90s toys we all know and love. The details are picture-perfect. Morticia has sleek black hair and a form-fitting black dress, while Gomez wears a blue pinstripe suit, with his dark brown hair parted in the middle. Pugsley has on his classic red-and-white striped t-shirt, and Wednesday is in all black with two black braids hanging over her shoulders.\nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY, from left: Jimmy Workman, Christina Ricci, 1991. ph: Melinda Sue Gordon / © Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection © Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection Although not every family member is included in the set — Cousin It and Lurch, you are missed! — but the most important person (part of person?) is there: The Thing! The creepy cool expressive hand never moves far from the Addams family, so of course it needed to be in this collaboration as well. It can clip on to any of the family members while you play.\nThe bottom part of the compact features the outside grounds, complete with a tiny coffin Puglsey can nap in, gravestones, and a Piranha plant. The top half features the inside of the mysterious home, complete with a knight-in-shining-armor, a crystal ball, a piano, a candelabra, and a bookshelf filled with interesting items. And just like ever great haunted house, there are hidden secrets and moving parts everywhere!\nThe Addams Family x Polly Pocket/Amazon The Addams Family x Polly Pocket/Amazon Even the outside of the compact holds a spot of magic! The four family members sit in front, and if you twist the top they slowly transform into skeleton-looking characters.\nShop this creepy toy (and cool collector’s item!) below.\nPolly Pocket Collector Playset 'The Addams Family' Compact $30 Buy Now The world’s kookiest family is so cute in Polly Pocket form!\nCheck out these sweet & spooky Halloween books for the kids!",

    "title": "Storm duo to wallop West Coast with rain, mountain snow and wind",
    "text": "By Alex Sosnowski ,\n8 days ago A pair of storms--likely the strongest in a train-- will affect areas from Central California to Washington and British Columbia with the risk of flooding rain, blizzard conditions and damaging winds to end this week.\nA pair of storms rolling ashore at the end of the week into the weekend have the potential to trigger significant power outages and travel problems from California to Washington, AccuWeather meteorologists say. One storm will precede the duo, and more are likely to follow.\nTwo storms will move ashore roughly at about the same time Saturday local time--one will move into Northern California and the other into Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Both storms will be rather potent, packing strong winds and heavy precipitation, but will likely fall short of becoming bomb cyclones .\nHeavy, wet, clinging snow that can weigh down trees and lines will increase the risk of power outages in the Sierra Nevada.\n\"Winds can become strong enough in portions of Northern and Central California and western Washington and southern British Columbia to trigger local to regional power outages,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.\nWind gusts averaging 40-60 mph are likely along the coast and in the mountains of Northern and Central California, as well as in western Washington and British Columbia through Saturday. Higher gusts between 60 and 80 mph are possible in the Sierra Nevada as the southern storm may be more potent than the northern storm. Top gusts over the ridges and peaks in the Sierra Nevada may exceed 100 mph. Breezy conditions with only sporadic wind problems are likely over much of Oregon.\nA firehose effect of moisture is likely to be aimed at portions of Northern and Central California. Snowfall rates up to a few inches per hour can occur in the northern Sierra Nevada and Siskiyous through Saturday, where several feet of snow will pile up over the high country and a general 1-3 feet of snow likely over the passes.\n\"Snow levels may be above the passes briefly at the onset but then drop significantly,\" Douty said.\nThunder and lightning can accompany the snow with blizzard conditions. The combined effects from snow and wind with the storm in parts of California may force roads to close for a time over the higher elevations.\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+ \"Rain will pour down in low elevations in Northern California and the southwestern part of Oregon as well from Friday through Saturday,\" Douty said.\nFrom 4 to 8 inches will fall on the western and southern-facing slopes of the Coast Ranges, with 2-4 inches in store starting near San Francisco to Redding and just east of Sacramento.\nRainfall totals of 1-2 inches are likely over the rest of the low elevations of Central California. Where the heaviest rain falls, there will be a risk of mudslides, other debris flows and slides and road washouts. Motorists should be prepared for flooded roads in locations that typically drain poorly.\nIn much of Southern California, winds will be light compared to the action up in the central and northern parts of the state with the storm this weekend. Still, breezy conditions may hamper fire-fighting efforts for the Franklin Fire .\nLittle to no rain is likely in Southern California from the storm farther north in the state this weekend.\nMeanwhile, the storm forecast to affect the Northwest will bring locally heavy rain and high country snow to western Washington and southwestern British Columbia from Friday to Saturday.\nThe strongest winds are likely from the western slopes of the mountains to the coast in Washington and southern British Columbia, where power outages are most likely with the northern storm.\nEnough rain can fall in low elevations of Washington to lead to sporadic urban flooding problems. From 6-12 inches of snow is likely to fall over the Cascades. Much heavier rain and mountain snow are likely to fall on British Columbia which could result in more significant urban flooding in Vancouver and the risk of temporary road closures in the mountains.\nAdditional storms will roll in from the Pacific Ocean after the duo through Saturday. However, there may be another break in the action later next week instead of the storm train running longer.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – Los católicos del sur de Florida se están uniendo en oración después de que el Vaticano confirmara el sábado que el Papa Francisco se encuentra en estado crítico mientras continúa luchando contra graves problemas de salud.\nEl Vaticano informó que Francisco, cuyo nombre legal es Jorge Mario Bergoglio, sufrió una crisis respiratoria asmática prolongada mientras recibía tratamiento por neumonía y una infección pulmonar compleja.\nLa Catedral de Santa María en Miami celebró varios servicios el domingo en múltiples idiomas. Uno en creole haitiano, otro en inglés y uno en español.\nEl Reverendo Robert Ayala, de la Iglesia Católica de la Natividad en Hollywood, compartió su profunda preocupación por el Santo Padre de 88 años con Cody Weddle de Local 10.\n“Ha sido un Santo Padre increíble”, dijo Ayala. “Ha guiado a la iglesia y como pastor del rebaño, obviamente queremos lo mejor para él”.\nEn un evento previo al carnaval en la iglesia, la salud del pontífice fue el tema principal de conversación entre los fieles.\nVirginia Stewart, una católica local, expresó su compromiso con la oración.\n“Rezo por él y rezo mi rosario por él todos los días”, dijo.\nRichard Amsden, otro feligrés local, reflexionó sobre la gravedad de la condición del Papa.\n“Tiene bronquitis, tiene 88 años y ahora con neumonía doble”, dijo Amsden. “Ciertamente siempre está en nuestras oraciones y sabemos que Jesús es el médico divino. Y rezamos para que lo cuide”.\nPara muchos católicos, Francisco es uno de los pocos papas que han conocido en sus vidas, y están reflexionando sobre sus casi 12 años de papado mientras mantienen la esperanza en su recuperación.\nAmal Khouzam, una joven feligresa, elogió el ejemplo del Papa.\n“Hay como una imagen de Cristo en él”, dijo. “Simplemente el hecho de que refleja a Cristo en lo que hace”.\nA pesar de la naturaleza repentina de su deterioro de salud, los fieles mantienen la esperanza de que la medicina moderna y sus oraciones ayudarán a revertir su condición.\nAyala hizo un llamado a la comunidad en general para unirse en oración.\n“Espero que quien esté viendo, quien esté escuchando, se una a nosotros sean católicos o no”, dijo Ayala. “Porque al final del día, él es un ser humano y si somos una familia bajo Dios, entonces nos cuidamos los unos a los otros”.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
