    "title": "Los riesgos del aspartamo: el edulcorante más popular perjudica la salud cardiovascular",
    "text": "El aspartamo, uno de los edulcorantes artificiales más comunes en refrescos dietéticos y alimentos sin azúcar, podría tener efectos negativos en la salud cardiovascular, según un estudio publicado en la revista Cell Metabolism . Investigadores del Instituto Karolinska de Suecia encontraron que el consumo de este sustituto del azúcar puede aumentar los niveles de insulina y favorecer la acumulación de lípidos en las arterias, lo que eleva el riesgo de ataques cardíacos o accidentes cerebrovasculares.\nEl estudio surgió cuando el autor principal, Yihai Cao , observó a uno de sus estudiantes bebiendo un refresco ‘light’. «Le dije: ‘¿Por qué no investigas eso?'», recuerda Cao, experto en enfermedades crónicas relacionadas con trastornos vasculares. «No creo que este mecanismo de inflamación vascular sea exclusivo de los edulcorantes », explica Cao a SINC. «Los azúcares con alto contenido calórico, incluidas las bebidas energéticas, podrían tener efectos perjudiciales similares».\nTres latas de refresco al día Para llevar a cabo la investigación, los científicos alimentaron a los ratones durante tres meses con dosis diarias de alimentos que contenían un 0,15 % de aspartamo , una cantidad equivalente a consumir aproximadamente tres latas de refresco dietético al día en humanos. Los resultados mostraron que, en comparación con los roedores que no recibieron una dieta con edulcorantes, los ejemplares alimentados con aspartamo desarrollaron placas arteriales más grandes y con mayor contenido de grasa , además de niveles más altos de inflamación , ambos indicadores de una salud cardiovascular comprometida.\nAl analizar la sangre de los ratones, el equipo encontró un aumento en los niveles de insulina después de que el aspartamo ingresara en su sistema. Este resultado se atribuye a que la boca, los intestinos y otros tejidos están revestidos de receptores que detectan la dulzura y guían la liberación de insulina. Sin embargo, el aspartamo, que es 200 veces más dulce que el azúcar , parecía engañar a estos receptores para que liberaran más insulina de lo normal.\nEl estudio también reveló que este exceso de insulina podría ser el vínculo entre el consumo de aspartamo y la acumulación de placa arterial. Además, los investigadores identificaron una señal inmunitaria llamada CX3CL1, que se vuelve especialmente activa con niveles elevados de insulina y contribuye a la inflamación y formación de placas. «Es cierto que las bebidas dietéticas bajas en calorías hacen que la gente piense que son menos dañinas, lo que lleva a un consumo elevado que ciertamente aumentaría el riesgo descrito en nuestro estudio », añade Cao. «Nuestros datos sugieren que los edulcorantes no son tan saludables como pensábamos».\nLimitaciones Sin embargo, los propios autores advierten de la necesidad de coger con pinzas estos resultados. «Hay una limitación en el estudio: el modelo de ratones o de animales puede ser no relevante para humanos », dice al SMC Rafael Urrialde, profesor en la facultad de Ciencias Biológicas de la Universidad Complutense. «Esta limitación es similar a muchos estudios realizados, por aspectos fisiológicos y por situación de adaptación de los procesos metabólicos en humanos por la ingesta de determinados nutrientes o compuestos».\nLa Agencia Europea de Seguridad Alimentaria (EFSA) ha evaluado y reevaluado en numerosas ocasiones al aspartamo, la última en 2013, considerándolo seguro. Sus consideraciones se han mantenido incluso después del posicionamiento de la OMS en 2023 , que incluyó al edulcorante en su grupo 2B (posiblemente carcinógeno) tras encontrar «evidencia limitada» de que su consumo podía aumentar el riesgo de cáncer.\nLos próximos pasos del equipo pasan por verificar si estos hallazgos se confirman en humanos y explorar si CX3CL1 podría ser un objetivo para tratar enfermedades crónicas como el accidente cerebrovascular, la artritis y la diabetes. «Los edulcorantes artificiales están en casi todos los alimentos, por lo que es crucial comprender su impacto a largo plazo en la salud», concluye el investigador.",

    "text": "Saigon Fuel JSC revealed in late December its cooperation with VinFast to survey gas stations for the installation of charging stations. If all requirements are met, the company, which currently operates 18 gas stations, will proceed with construction.A Saigon Fuel leader stated that fire safety approval is required before proceeding. Additionally, setting up charging stations takes up space, affecting sales activities and business performance, particularly at smaller stations.“The company will consider cooperation at larger premises that meet fire safety standards,” the representative said.Petrolimex and PV Oil have already launched hundreds of electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities at their gas stations nationwide for VinFast vehicles. At the end of November, Vingroup and PV Power signed an agreement to develop a nationwide EV charging system, with a network of 1,000 stations planned by PV Power before 2030.Elsewhere, Centre Mall Vo Van Kiet in Ho Chi Minh City’s District 6, which will soon open, will feature two areas for charging EVs and motorbikes.Two charging stations, each with four ports offering fast charging speeds of 60KW for VinFast EVs, are being built by Saigon Trading Group in collaboration with V-Green. Additionally, there is a 120KW superfast charging station from partner Eboost for other EVs.The EV charging station business also creates new opportunities for businesses and individuals as greener vehicles become popular. In September, VinFast introduced franchise charging stations with a fixed revenue-sharing rate for franchise partners, applicable for a minimum of 10 years. Within just over a month, VinFast received nearly 1,000 applications to open franchise charging stations.In the market, major enterprises have already joined VinFast’s franchise model. For instance, Vasia JSC has deployed 30 franchise charging points in the northern province of Bac Ninh, while Fast+ Charging Station JSC signed a cooperation agreement to install 5,000 stations nationwide at shopping centres, residential areas, public car parks, and highway rest stops.Nguyen Phi Long, director of Fast+ Charging Station, said, “Investing in and developing charging stations is not only a good business opportunity but also contributes to promoting green transportation and supporting the government’s net-zero commitments.” Exponential growth In response to rising demand, restaurants, hotels, resorts, and shopping malls are investing in EV charge stations. Some e-car users have reportedly cancelled trips or avoided destinations and services lacking charging facilities.An Dinh Nha, general director of GG Charging JSC, said the company offered various models, including franchise, joint investment, and self-funding by individuals and companies.“Recently, many clients such as supermarkets, shopping malls, restaurants, and office buildings have expressed interest in investing in charging stations for both customers and employees,” he said. “We are proactively seeking suitable premises in crowded areas to install small-scale charging stations with low investment costs and quick capital recovery.”Nguyen Hung Thuong, CEO of Solar Z Energy Investment JSC, which installs charging stations for restaurants, hotels, resorts, and highway rest stops, said demand was surging from foreign investment funds, domestic companies with technological expertise, and individual investors.“The demand for installing EV charging stations this year has doubled compared to last year and is expected to grow even more next year. Recently, a client commissioned my company to install a chain of over 70 charging points, while another restaurant and hotel system has completed nearly 20 charging points,” he said.The charging station market will become more dynamic in the coming years as more electric trucks, buses, and containers enter operation. The tax exemption and reduction roadmap under trade agreements is also improving EV affordability and boosting purchasing power, Thuong added. Chinese EVs cannot wait According to a report by market research firm Counterpoint Research in mid-2024, Vietnam has experienced impressive growth in this area, with battery EV sales increasing more than four-fold and contributing nearly 17 per cent of Southeast Asia’s regional sales. But most of them are VinFast models, while the Chinese EV wave seems to be slowing down in Vietnam due to lack of charging stations.In recent years, users have had more choice as EV models distributed in Vietnam are increasingly made available, with a variety of types, segments, and prices that have already been launched on the market.In addition to VinFast, Chinese companies like Wuling, BYD, and GAC Aion have also entered the market with several models. BYD is the Chinese company selling the most EVs in Vietnam, with six models. According to Chinese vehicle info service Yiche, this was the third best-selling brand globally at one point last year, only trailing behind Volkswagen and Toyota.Wuling, distributed by TMT Motors, introduced its Mini EV model into Vietnam in 2023. It has been the world’s best-selling mini EV since 2020. However, it has not been able to make a breakthrough in Vietnam.“Although the manufacturer did not announce sales figures, the business situation of this brand at dealerships has not shown signs of improvement. The main obstacle for BYD and Chinese EVs is the lack of a public charging station system,” said Truong Thanh Long, a Wuling salesperson.In Vietnam, VinFast is the only EV manufacturer to have developed a public charging station system that covers almost the entire country, and its continuing development is not being shared with other brands. Some third-party units such as EV One, Evercharge, and Eboost have built charging stations, but very few.“The disadvantage of this is that Chinese EV owners and non-VinFast users have to charge their vehicles at home. However, not all users have parking space at home to charge, especially in big cities with high housing density, and many small alleys,” Long said.Against these challenges, Chinese car manufacturers are leaning towards offering more petrol or hybrid cars in the Vietnamese market soon. A raft of new Chinese car models are set to enter Vietnam to welcome the new year. However, very few of them are to be battery EVs, with hybrid and petrol-engine cars still making up a larger proportion.Of the four models being launched in the Vietnamese market this month alone, DongFeng Motor will dedicate two models to EVs, and the others to petrol and hybrid vehicles.Meanwhile, the Jaecoo J7 with a plug-in hybrid engine is expected to be launched in Vietnam in mid-January, the MG G50 will be on sale in at least two versions, both of which are petrol-run, and Haval Jolion will announce the selling price in early 2025 of its Pro and Ultra hybrids.GWM’s Tank 300 will also be introduced in early 2025, with both a petrol and hybrid version.The petrol-engine Omoda C5 arrived in Vietnam last month, although previously, the manufacturer said that the first products in Vietnam would include a pure electric version of the C5. Indonesian officials have emphasised the importance of developing downstream industries, particularly in electric vehicle (EV) battery production, to enhance the country's economic value. China's leading electric vehicle maker PT BYD Motor plans to invest 11,700 billion IDR (754 million USD) to build a plant with a capacity of 150,000 units of electric vehicles (EVs) per year in Indonesia, a local official said on October 16. Air pollution is a global issue, with transportation as a major contributor. Reducing vehicle emissions is vital for environmental protection, and transitioning to clean energy vehicles, particularly electric vehicles (EVs), is vital for the industry.",

    "text": "Southern Charm's two new castmembers are spilling the sweet tea on their past plastic surgeries.\nSeason 10 newbies Molly O'Connell and Salley Carson have formed a bond over their many cosmetic procedures.\n\"Being a woman is so hard,\" Salley admitted while grabbing drinks with her costar during the Bravo series' Jan. 30 episode.. \"I'm sitting there getting my lips [done] today and my chin and I'm like, 'This hurts so f--king bad!'\"\nMolly echoed her costar, noting, \"I literally got chin filler two days ago. I did it here because I have a very short chin.\"\nBut a little filler is the least surprising nip/tuck Molly has on her list of past procedures. In fact, she's even had work done on her gums, as she added, \"I got my gums cut last year.\"\nThe Charleston locals went on to compare Botox stories, with Molly noting of her doctor, \"He put some in my jaw too. Like one of my jaws is gnarly and the other one's just like.\"\nIn a confessional, Molly explained her philosophy when it comes to going under the knife in order to keep up her appearance.\n\"I'm not trying to change how I look, I'm just trying to keep it somewhat stable,\" the former model shared. \"I wanna look a little younger than I actually am for as long as I can.\"\nAs for I think I started to do it because I was insecure, but then I realized it makes you feel good too. So, I'm gonna continue to do that.\nThen, Salley opened up about her plans to have her breast implants removed, which prompted Molly to make an unexpected confession about her own artificially enhanced boobs.\n\"These are fat transfer,\" she told Salley with a tap to her chest. A shocked Salley replied, \"I wanna see your boobs but I'm not gonna ask you to do that.\"\nAs for what Molly’s fat transfer entailed, she didn’t hold back in in her confessional.\n\"My ankles were a little thicker than your average person,\" she recounted. \"I was always a bit bothered by it. So, finally I got ankle and calf liposuction and then I shot the fat into my boobs because I had no boobies.\"\nAnd she's extremely happy with the results.\n\"People are not giving me bad feedback,\" she told Salley. \"Guys are saying 'you look great.'\"\nKeep reading to see more celebrities who have gotten candid about going under the knife or embracing cosmetic procedures.\nSouthern Charm airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.\n(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family)\nCheck out Peacock to binge your favorite NBCU TV shows and movies, live sports and more!",
