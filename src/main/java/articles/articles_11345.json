    "text": "在最近的交易期，伦敦交易所今年5月期货的罗布斯塔咖啡价格每吨增159美元，达到5645美元；7月期货的价格每吨增155美元，达5599美元。\n在纽约交易所，今年5月期货的阿拉比卡咖啡价格每磅增11.75美分，每磅达398.4美分；7月期货的价格每磅增9.5美分，每磅为387.7美分。\n据专家分析，美元贬值是因交易者考虑贸易紧张局势与经济活动疲软，而欧元保持稳定和美国暂停对乌克兰的军事援助。\n价格上涨还因巴西主要种植区降雨量减少，以及越南前两个月咖啡出口量下降。\n农业与环境部表示，今年前两个月，农林水产出口总金额近94亿美元，同比增长8.3%。\n在主要出口商品中，木材及木制品以逾25亿美元位居榜首，增12.4%。咖啡两个月出口28万4000吨、达近16亿美元，跃居第二位。尽管出口量下降逾28%，但由于价格同比上涨约74%，平均每吨达5575美元◆",

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs outplayed the Miami Dolphins 26-7 and the performance of the side immediately made all heads turn. But, it was not the playing team that was showered by appreciation from the HC’s side. So, who were Reid’s praises reserved for this time?\nAmerica’s Favorite Video Today\nIt was the support staff of the Chiefs that made Reid comment about their irreplaceable contributions to the game in a rather harsh weather situation. They immediately were thanked by the coach for their constant efforts during the clash and for putting in relentless work to make the match a possibility in such tough weather conditions.\nAndy Reid thanks the team for making the field playable ADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAndy Reid stepped onto the podium to answer the reporters’ questions after the staggering victory against the Dolphins. The very first thing he did was thank the support staff for making the unexpected clash a reality for the team and allowing them to play a full game during such challenging conditions. “Cleaning things up and making that field playable. They did a great job,” reflected the appreciation pouring in from Reid.\nThe Head Coach then went on to express his admiration for the Dolphins. It is a well-known fact that the weather down in Florida is as different from KC as it can be. The Dolphins team is more used to warm, humid temperatures, not the frigid temperatures of KC. “They beared with all the weather,” he said about them, praising the opposition for their commitment.\nTrending Divided by Divorce, United by Shelomi: Deion Sanders Joins Forces With Ex-wife Pilar to Become Daughter’s Pillar of Strength January 13, 2024 12:35 pm EDT\nWhat Is Patrick Mahomes’ 2024 Net Worth?

Yet, unlike several previous games, the offense did not step away from the show this time. Kicker Harrison Butker played a huge part in the Chiefs’ victory. He scored four field goals during the game, and that is a Chiefs postseason record! The Chiefs knew that the temperature would be cold, but they had their plans well set. As QB Patrick Mahomes revealed, their idea remained focusing on “Let’s come in with that fire.”\nUSA Today via Reuters\nDec 31, 2023; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) celebrates toward the fans against the Cincinnati Bengals at GEHA Field at prior to a game Arrowhead Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\nFor the Dolphins, however, things once again end earlier than they would have wished. Three weeks ago, they were the captain of their ship and it looked like they were unbeatable in this season. But then they lost two games in a row in Week 17 and 18, making the momentum shift subsequently for them. They were set for the No. 1 seed, but in the end, had to settle for the 6th seed. All unfortunate losses and twists finally ended with their second straight-away Wild Card game and another disappointing performance in it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAs the Chiefs progress onto the Divisional Round, which team will they have to take on?
