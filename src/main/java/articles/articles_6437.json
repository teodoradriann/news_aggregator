    "text": "Michigan DNR & South Shore Fishing Association partner for major projects on Lake Superior & Teal Lake\nMARQUETTE COUNTY, Mich. (WLUC) - The Michigan DNR has been growing its relationship with the South Shore Fishing Association in recent years. One project from their partnership will be adding an influx of walleye to Teal Lake in Negaunee and Ishpeming. The restocking will start this year and continue every other year for the next 10 years. The end goal is to add one million walleye.\n“They’re great with us supporting what we do in our event,” SSFA Vice President & Co-Tournament Chair Jesse Bianchi said. “We’re a fishing association. We’d like to put fish back in lakes.”\nWalleye are popular for anglers at Teal Lake.\n“In the state of Michigan, we’re pretty blessed to have so many great opportunities for many tasty fish,” DNR Lake Superior Unit Manager Cory Kovacs said. “But walleye is on that variety.”\nKovacs says the walleye will be stocked in the fry stage. He says the fry are about 5-10 millimeters in length. This will allow the DNR to add more fry to Teal Lake every other year. According to FishOnTips.com, the fry stage occurs right before the adult stage. Walleye become adults at 2-4 years of age.\nKovacs says the DNR will monitor the amount of walleye in Teal Lake with annual fall recruitment surveys in September or October.\n“You might see a boat out with some lights on,” Kovacs said. “We do sample at nighttime. We do sample age zero walleye. That will give us a better idea for how much success we had from that stocking year class but also what contribution we had from natural reproduction as well.”\nKovacs likens this 10-year deal to a prescription your doctor would give you for medicine.\n“We have that prescription in place for Teal Lake to say, ‘Hey, look, this is what the recipe is to make a fishery for walleye opportunity there, but then, we’re gonna monitor it,’” Kovacs said. “Just like when you do your regular checkup.”\nAlong with the walleye restocking project, the DNR and SSFA are also partnering on a brown trout genetic study in Lake Superior.\n“I’d say there’s either three to four different types that we’re looking at,” Bianchi said. “Now, we don’t know if it’s just because of water clarity, what they’re eating, but to find the species that is here is crucial.”\nBianchi says a grant from the DNR has helped push these projects forward.\nCopyright 2025 WLUC.

    "text": "Another major Israeli cybersecurity firm has been sold in a blockbuster deal. Following Wiz's $32 billion sale, CyberArk is now being acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $25 billion. Founded about 20 years ago by Israeli Nir Zuk, Palo Alto is the world's largest cybersecurity company.Palo Alto Networks on Wednesday said that it's agreed to buy Israeli cybersecurity firm CyberArk for around $25 billion in cash and stock. CyberArk stockholders will receive $45 in cash and just over 2.2 Palo Alto shares per CyberArk share, reports Axios. This is the year's second cybersecurity megadeal, following Google's $32 billion agreement with Wiz.“Today, the rise of AI and the explosion of machine identities have made it clear that the future of security must be built on the vision that every identity requires the right level of privilege controls,” says Palo Alto chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora. “CyberArk is the definitive leader in Identity Security with durable, foundational technology that is essential for securing the AI era.”Udi Mokady, Founder and Executive Chairman of CyberArk, said: \\\"This is a profound moment in CyberArk's journey. From the beginning, we set out to protect the world's most critical assets, with a relentless focus on innovation, trust, and security. Joining forces with Palo Alto Networks is a powerful next chapter, built on shared values and a deep commitment to solving the toughest identity challenges. Together, we'll bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what's next. This is more than a combination of technologies—it's an acceleration of the mission we began over two decades ago. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has built and deeply grateful to everyone who made this milestone possible.\\\"What does CyberArk do?According to a report in Times of Israel, Cyberark is an Israeli cybersecurity firm and is traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange since 2014 with a market cap of almost $22 billion. The company specializes in identity security, including privileged accounts on corporate servers, to help businesses protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure against external attackers and malicious insiders, the report suggests.CyberArk specializes in privileged access management, technology that helps organizations safeguard sensitive systems by limiting and monitoring access to critical accounts. Its customers include Carnival Corp, Panasonic and Aflac, Performance Food Group, State of Louisiana, Barclays, Coles Group, American Electric Power Company among others. \\\"Our mission is to secure the world against cyber threats so together we can move fearlessly forward,\\\" the company's website says. Analysts said Palo Alto could accelerate its AI security push by tapping its large salesforce to drive adoption of CyberArk's tools, seen as vital for securing AI systems. \\\"It helps broaden the portfolio since Palo Alto does not have any offering in the 'identity' space,\\\" said Imtiaz Koujalgi, Roth Capital Partners' managing director of software research.\\\"Palo Alto also has been seeing growth slow in its next‑generation security portfolio, so adding CYBR will be helpful in driving incremental traction.\\\"Global cybersecurity spending is set to grow 12.2% in 2025 as rising AI-driven threats push companies to adopt stronger defenses, according to International Data Corp. The buyout is expected to close in fiscal 2026 and will immediately add to Palo Alto's revenue growth and gross margin.(With inputs from Reuters)",

    "title": "Without better transit, living car-free in St. George is more pipe dream than reality | KUER",
    "text": "Without better transit, living car-free in St. George is more pipe dream than reality In the sprawling desert landscape of southwest Utah, life without a car is, if you’ll pardon the pun, full of roadblocks. The St. George bus system, [SunTran](https://sgcityutah.gov/services/suntran_bus_system/index.php), doesn’t reach large swaths of the city, with just [one stop](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/stgeorge/images/Suntran%20Routes/Suntran%20-%20complete%20map.pdf) south of the Virgin River. For people in those neighborhoods who don’t have a car, such as Vanessa Miller, everyday tasks quickly become frustrating and expensive. “I can't get to work. I can't get to probation. I spend almost $250 a week trying to get everywhere I need to go.” That money goes to rideshare apps, she said, when it could go toward saving for a car. “I pay my rent, pay my bills, I eat, and then I pay the Ubers,” Miller said. “I just want to be able to have my own vehicle and to be able to succeed in life.” Elaina Pitchford recently moved to St. George as a way to get closer to family and medical care. With the nearest bus stop two miles from her home, however, it’s been a struggle for her to get anywhere. “I've got six grandsons and a great-granddaughter … and I can't even go see them because there's no bus system.” Pitchford and Miller raised their concerns at an Aug. 28 public transit town hall in St. George. The meeting was the latest step in an [ongoing effort](https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2024-02-21/utahns-in-the-435-want-lawmakers-to-boost-public-transit-beyond-the-wasatch-front) dubbed The Committee for Public Transit in the 435, which is organized by the advocacy group [United Today Stronger Tomorrow](https://unitedtoday.org/). The goal is to bring together people who care about transit issues in communities outside of the Wasatch Front and to push local leaders to invest in more transportation options for Utah’s rural areas. Beyond expanding bus service, some residents also want to see St. George make it safer and easier for people to get around without a car by choice. Judith Rognli, of Conserve Southwest Utah, moved downtown specifically because it would allow her to access more places on her bike. After seven years of car-free life, however, her family gave in and bought a vehicle earlier this year. “It was just not feasible anymore,” she said. “It takes so much time and dedication here that even the most dedicated at some point are like, ‘OK, this is just too difficult.’” Thinking about active transportation — the way people move around without cars — is a vital element in planning a city that works for everyone, she said. For instance, St. George’s paved trail system provides many miles of protected biking space, but it often doesn’t connect with shops and businesses. To her, that’s a missed opportunity. “It is about connecting the dots … and really thinking about people who walk and people who bike and people who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids,” Rognli said. “I think if we started doing that, we could make a big difference.” St. George has been one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities in recent years. Washington County’s population has nearly [doubled](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UTWASH3POP) over the past two decades, from 104,317 residents in 2003 to 202,452 in 2023. That’s led to plenty of [concerns](https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2024-02-14/growth-remains-a-blessing-and-a-curse-as-st-george-takes-stock-of-the-last-year) about traffic and road infrastructure as new residents bring in more vehicles. The idea of enhancing public transportation in southwest Utah seems to be gaining some traction. St. George City Council Member Steve Kemp, who attended the town hall, said in order to grow transit, the city needs the county and neighboring communities to pitch in. “It boils down to money. The bottom line is: You have dollars, then you can buy new buses and you can put in new routes. … So it's just a function of funding.” And at least one upcoming regional transit development might offer some help. St. George is launching a [new regional bus line](https://www.kuer.org/business-economy/2024-07-19/bound-for-zion-here-are-the-details-on-a-new-bus-to-connect-st-george-and-springdale) that would connect the city with neighboring towns Washington, Hurricane and La Verkin on its way to [Zion National Park](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm). That route is planned to have a stop near the county’s Department of Motor Vehicles and the local probation and parole office. Southwest Utah’s Five County Association of Governments is also conducting its first [online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FiveCountyUtah) specifically focused on better understanding the area’s transit needs. The association wants to gather feedback about challenges facing older Utahns and people in rural areas, said Mobility Manager Scott Buys. “We already know there's gaps, and … the reality is it's a challenge to try to improve those services. But again, there's some good dialog going on.” The survey began in May and will remain open until November. The plan is to use the results to pinpoint where local governments should invest time and money in future transit projects. “It's hopefully going to provide some information that will give specific recommendations on how we can potentially improve those rural services — or lack thereof — to better meet the needs of those people.”",

They were all residents of the city.Police said Afroz, who runs a hotel in the Bariatu area in the city, was going to Ormanjhi in a Maruti Swift car at about 2 am to drop his staff, Raju, at his village. Afroz’s friends, Amir and Sabir, also accompanied him in the car, which was speeding. It then hit an electrical pole, jumped over a drain, and then crashed against a wall, police said.Lakshmi Kant, in charge of Sadar police station, said soon after receiving information about the accident, 2 police control room (PCR) cars rushed to the spot and began rescue operations. He said rescuers used a crane to hoist the car back on its wheels in order to extricate the 4 men out of the car. All 4 victims were rushed to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences by 3.30 am, Kant said.“We informed relatives of the victims after retrieving their mobile phones,” he said.“All the victims were unconscious when they were taken to the hospital.
