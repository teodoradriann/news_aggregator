    "title": "13-hour rescue: Family of kittens pulled from storm drain in 108-degree heat",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS ( KVVU /Gray News) - A Las Vegas family spent 13 hours in triple-digit heat to rescue kittens and their mother from a storm drain. And after the hourslong ordeal, they were able to reunite the mother cat with her babies. The situation happened near a neighborhood park in the northwest part of town this week. Dana Hernandez said her daughter and husband were on an early morning walk when they heard crying coming from a storm drain. “They saw the mama cat jump into the sewer. That caught my child’s attention, and my husband came over and saw the kittens,” she said. Hernandez and her mother, Julie Woodward, said they called Las Vegas Animal Control several times, as well as the police department and the fire department. As temperatures soared to 108 degrees Fahrenheit, the family members said they yanked off the storm drain to drop down water and food for the kittens and the mother. “The mommy was very emaciated. We gave her two cans of food and she ate all of it. She was starving,” Woodward said. Hernandez managed to crawl down the storm drain and pull out several of the kittens. The family took them to an emergency veterinarian, who said they were dehydrated and malnourished. Animal control arrived that afternoon and with a small trap, they tried to retrieve the other cats still inside the drain. Volunteers also stepped in to help and were able to pull out the additional kittens, but then the mother cat could not be found. Late Friday night, Animal control officers dropped off another trap to help find the mother. “They were probably in there for a couple of days. They’re very, very small,” Woodward said. The family didn’t give up their efforts, either, and during the overnight hours, their mission was complete by locating the mother cat and reuniting her with her five kittens. “She was very scared, but she is safe with all five of her kittens rescued. The babies cried all night long, but when we added momma into the room with them, they all stopped and started nursing,” Hernandez said. The family said they plan to adopt all of the kittens.

    "text": "KERR COUNTY, Texas — We are getting new glimpses of the devastation in Kerr County and the destruction left behind reflects just how quickly and ferociously the floodwaters came in late last week.\nA family of nine had gathered for what was supposed to be a fun-filled 4th of July weekend, which quickly turned into a fight for their lives.\n“It’s hell ... but we’re alive, God was with us every second and provided what we needed,” said 83-year-old Penny Deupree.\nAn incredible story of survival for this Hunt, Texas matriarch and her family.\n\"Right there's the escape hatch,” said Penny Deupree. \"I was the hardest one to squeeze. That was the problem. I couldn't diet fast enough to get out there, but anyways.\"\nPenny was the first to wake up and sense something wrong in the early morning hours of July 4th.\n“I got up to go to the bathroom. And when I went to the bathroom, I flushed it,” said Penny. “And it goes...And I went, again, you know, we're having plumbing problems, so I laid down for a few minutes and I went. You know, it's rained a lot. I think maybe I better check the front of the house. That's what... It was just flooding already.'\nHer daughter, Keri Wilt, who lives two miles down the road, explains how all nine people staying at the house managed to escape.\n\"So they gathered everybody up into the sleeping loft – this is where the grandkids slept, right, they all got up to there and you can see as you pan around where the water level was,” said Keri. “Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, each one of them had a buoy and we're just hitting it and trying to get out.\"\n\"Who was holding the babies,” CNN reporter Pamela Brown asked. \"This is insane. I can't believe they survived.\"\n\"Uh, their parents, so they had a whole system getting them to safety,\" said Keri. \"It's, it's not insane, it's a miracle.\"\nSeven adults, two babies, and two dogs, trapped in the attic with the water is rising quickly. They knew the only way to get out was somehow to burst through a wall and so they just grabbed something. All they had in the pitch black was a baby monitor light to guide them. The three men worked diligently to punch through the wall of the attic.\nThey knew that most of their possessions were gone, but they’re left with the most important thing.\n\"We have nine lives,\" said Keri. \"We have everybody safe. Everybody's healthy, not barely a scratch on anybody.\"\nAnd a connection to their family history... While a little battered and bruised, is another story to tell.\n\"My great-great-grandmother is Frances Hodgson Burnett,\" said Keri. \"She's the author of The Secret Garden, Little Boy, A Little Princess, and 50 other books, and my mother was the keeper of her stuff, so she remained actually hanging here throughout. She got waterlogged of course, but she's OK.\"\n\"A lot of laughter was had in this house...,\" said Keri.\nAnd plenty of laughter still to come... \"You’re exactly right,\" said Penny.\n\"We found my Dad's ashes,\" said Keri, pointing to a box with a few drinks sitting on top.\n\"Oh my gosh... should we move the Dr. Peppers off of him,\" said Brown. \"Give him some dignity here,\" said Penny.\nEven if it's sitting around in a circle by the rubble ... Because they’re still on this side of earth -- and together.\n\"He’d find that amusing I think,\" said a family member.\n\"You must’ve thought at one point that you were going to die?\"\n\"No... I didn’t... no. Cause that’s not an option, right? Is it,\" said Penny.\nPenny's house is unlivable after the flood.\nPenny has moved in with her daughter for now ... who says she's thrilled to have a new roommate.\nThe Deupree family does have a GoFundMe to help with the rebuilding process.",

    "text": "Once renowned for its high-quality Mandarin oranges, Darjeeling has seen a decline in orange cultivation over the past few years due to climate change and pest attacks. Frustrated by mounting losses, many local farmers abandoned orange farming.\nHowever, a renewed effort is now underway to revive this iconic crop, with the state government and international experts joining hands to support farmers.\nThe 2nd International Workshop on Climate-Resilient Orange Cultivation in the Eastern Himalayas, held today at Cluny Women’s College in Kalimpong, brought together experts from Nepal, Bhutan, the US, Iran, and China. Organised by the Directorate of Cinchona & Other Medicinal Plants, Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), and the department of food processing industries & horticulture, the two-day event aims to equip farmers with innovative techniques and global best practices to rejuvenate orange farming.\nMinister-in-charge of food processing industries and horticulture, Arup Roy, was also present at the workshop today after inaugurating it.\nGTA chief executive Anit Thapa, who attended the workshop, highlighted key focus areas, including strategies for disease-free saplings, climate-resilient farming techniques, and sustainable growth for the farming community. “This initiative marks a significant step toward securing the livelihood of our farmers and ensuring a thriving orange cultivation ecosystem in the Eastern Himalayas,” Thapa said.\nHe also emphasised the commitment to holding annual workshops to strengthen efforts in making orange farming more sustainable and prosperous. “Together, let’s work towards a greener, resilient, and prosperous future for our farmers,” Thapa added.\nThe workshop underscores a collective push to restore Darjeeling’s orange legacy, offering hope to farmers and revitalising a key agricultural sector in the region.",
