    "text": "Roebuck, SC, May 31, 2024 --( PR.com )-- “The Messiah Chronicles Part 1 From First Light to Darkness”: an intriguing journey through the annals of time, from the moment of creation to the present-day battleground of spiritual warfare. “The Messiah Chronicles Part 1 From First Light to Darkness” is the creation of published author, Douglas Robert Bodem, whose background includes teaching middle school in Malaysia, being married to his sweetheart of over fifty-one years, becoming an ordained minister, producing a weekly Christian radio program, ministering through the streets of Istanbul and the jungles of Peru, registered with the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, Manpower Training and Development Manager for CIBA-Geigy Pharmaceuticals (NOVARTIS), and working disaster relief and recovery for twelve years with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\nBodem shares, “Follow Wisdom as he narrates the creation of the universe with two angels at his side. The miraculous touch of God’s word flows out, making everything we see come into existence. It is now that the Creator starts the cosmic clock of time. Witness the creation of the most beautiful and enticing of all angels called MERIBEL (Satan) as it transforms into a false jealous god, attempting to create a “perfect” universe of its own. See angels fall and join in that false teaching, following their powerfully built and beautiful master. Your guide Wisdom reveals evil entering the world of humans, wreaking havoc along mankind’s history with stories of Adam and Eve, Noah, Jesus, Joan of Arc, and the US Civil War—eventually up to the present day. The fallen angels called Mites then prepare for what they think will be an eternity of keeping humans from knowing the truth about their Creator. After being indoctrinated and assigned to an area of planet Earth known as the Bible Belt, two little Mites attempt to destroy the faith of humans they contact. News reaches the duo of a galaxy-wide symposium by their dark leadership. They become concerned not having reached their assigned misguidance quota preventing humans converting to the truth by accepting the God of the universe. Our two Mites are fearful of the consequences of this meeting. Their trip to this conference proves most eventful when MERIBEL himself shows up.”\nPublished by Christian Faith Publishing, Douglas Robert Bodem’s new book offers a unique perspective on biblical events and spiritual warfare, inviting readers to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe and the divine plan for humanity.\nConsumers can purchase “The Messiah Chronicles Part 1 From First Light to Darkness” at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or inquiries about “The Messiah Chronicles Part 1 From First Light to Darkness,” contact the Christian Faith Publishing media department at 866-554-0919.",

    "title": "Al Mohler vs. Pope Francis on human nature – Baptist News Global",
    "text": "The papacy is an “unbiblical office” and Pope Francis is a heretic, according to Southern Baptist leader Al Mohler. Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., blasted the pope in his May 21 podcast called “ The Briefing .” This is not the first time Mohler has criticized Pope Francis. But this time, the disagreement is about the fundamental nature of humanity. Pope Francis sees humans as good at heart; Mohler sees humans as morally depraved from birth. A key tenet of the Calvinistic theology Mohler espouses is “total depravity,” the idea that since the fall of Adam and Eve, all babies are born with a sinful nature that condemns them before God from the first breath of life. The spark for the current debate began with Pope Francis being interviewed May 19 on the CBS news program 60 Minutes . At the end of the interview, CBS correspondent Norah O’Donnell asks: “When you look at the world, what gives you hope?” Pope Francis responds: “Everything. You see tragedies, but you also see so many beautiful things. You see heroic mothers, heroic men, men who have hopes and dreams, women who look to the future. That gives me a lot of hope. People want to live. People forge ahead. And people are fundamentally good. We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good.” Mohler considers that statement “absolute banality,” “a rejection of Roman Catholic doctrine” and an “abandonment of the gospel.” The Baptist seminary president begins his critique by declaring the papacy “an unbiblical office” now occupied by a man who is a “theological vacuum.” “We’re talking about a man who now inhabits that office who is the contradiction of at least many of the claims made by the Roman Catholic Church,” Mohler said. “He’s not the defender of even those Roman Catholic doctrines. Well, he relativizes them. He emotionalizes them. He is, in so many ways, the repudiation of the two popes who came before him, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who were known for their doctrinal precision, and also, for their brave defense of, for instance, the sanctity of human life.” Pope Francis has, in fact, been consistently “pro-life” in the tradition of modern Catholic teaching. However, he has expressed openness on other social issues traditional Catholics and conservative evangelicals share an alliance to oppose, such as immigration and welcome in the church for LGBTQ Christians. Even in the 60 Minutes interview, Francis clarified his statements on same-sex unions: “What I allowed was not to bless the union. That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament. I cannot. The Lord made it that way. But to bless each person, yes. The blessing is for everyone. For everyone. To bless a homosexual-type union, however, goes against the given right, against the law of the church. But to bless each person, why not? The blessing is for all. Some people were scandalized by this. But why? Everyone! Everyone!” Mohler has been an outspoken critic of homosexuality as a naturally occurring phenomenon and teaches that being gay — or transgender — is a sinful choice, not the way anyone is created by God. Thus Mohler began his latest broadside against the pope by saying: “Pope Francis represents the absolute worst of theological irresponsibility. And he often does so not so much by what he says, but well, just honestly, what he doesn’t say. And what he doesn’t say is in so many cases, even the defense of the classical Christian doctrines that the Roman Catholic Church still officially holds when it comes to such issues as, for instance, the person of Christ, when it comes to the doctrine of the Trinity. You’re just not going to hear things like that, not to mention on the moral issues related to human sexuality and abortion.” But it was Francis’ comment on human nature that set Mohler on a new tangent against the pontiff. He quoted the pope’s statement that “people are fundamentally good. We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good.” “Not only did the pope utter absolute banalities and empty words, he directly, repeatedly refuted the direct teachings of Scripture.” Mohler declared: “Now, in that case, not only did the pope utter absolute banalities and empty words, he directly, repeatedly refuted the direct teachings of Scripture.” He explained: “The Bible says that the heart is desperately wicked, and that’s clear language, as clear as it gets. And furthermore, you have this statement that is completely devoid of Christ, that you don’t even find Christ here. The pope claims to be and has claimed to be the vicar of Christ, but this is Christless. Now, I want to be very clear here. I’m talking about the abandonment of the gospel, and the Pope is not alone in this. And the Roman Catholic Church, let’s remember in its official doctrine, contradicts the Protestant understanding of the gospel as revealed in Scripture. That’s just a very honest statement.” Mohler continues by saying Pope Francis “is really on the side of the Protestant liberals who abandoned the faith, and that’s the point. And as you look at the Protestant side, we have a distinction between the Protestant liberals who have abandoned every single Christian doctrine, undermined the authority of Scripture, and quite frankly, created a new religion. Pope Francis, on the Catholic side, is pretty much just doing the same thing. “One lesson here is that theological liberalism ends up as the same mush, whether it’s Catholic mush or Protestant mush. It’s mush,” he concluded.

    "title": "Commentary: Empowering older adults in Orange County through nutrition - Los Angeles Times",
    "text": "Recent data show that 29% of seniors in Orange County are experiencing food insecurity, which means they do not have enough food, especially for a healthy and active life. This number is drastically rising, partially because older adults are the fastest-growing demographic, creating a “silver tsunami” of residents reaching the age of 65 and older. This surge is fueled by the swell of seniors projected to represent nearly a quarter of the county’s population in just a few decades. Inflation and the jump in grocery store prices by 25% since 2020 — with no sign of receding — are also contributing to this challenging scenario. April marks Senior Hunger Awareness Month, and the pressing need to address seniors' nutritional well-being demands sustained attention and action. Amid this growing need, organizations like Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County and Meals on Wheels Orange County play a crucial role in addressing senior hunger. Sharing a common goal to provide nutritious food to this vulnerable population, these nonprofits meet seniors where they are and ensure they are able to access the vital nutrition necessary for their health and vitality. In collaboration with its partners, Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County provides dignified, equitable and consistent access to nutritious food, creating a foundation for community health. To address this need among older adults, Second Harvest has pioneered the Park-It Market program as a key component of its Senior Grocery Program. The Park-It Market program debuted in 2018 as a national first: a mobile walk-up market housed within a refrigerated trailer for seniors to select fresh produce, protein and dairy, free of charge and right from their doorstep at senior centers and senior apartment communities across the county. Second Harvest also recently released a “proof-of-concept” Park-It Market 2 trailer — lovingly dubbed “Granny’s Market” in honor of the mother whose family foundation’s generous contribution helped to launch the vehicle — double-sided and equipped with shelving that allows seniors to grab the food that they want. Meals on Wheels Orange County is committed to erasing hunger and loneliness for at-risk seniors through nutritious meals, therapeutic care, social connections and other services that help them maintain their independence and quality of life. Meals on Wheels OC is advancing the vision, overall strategic initiatives and priorities, and is a deeply committed advocate of senior health in Orange County. Nutritious recipes are planned by a registered dietician and distributed through Meals on Wheels’ Lunch Café programs and Adult Day Health Care centers or the Meals on Wheels’ home-delivered program, thus meeting 100% of the daily nutritional value this vulnerable population needs. Ensuring that low and fixed-income seniors receive food deliveries is just one aspect of senior nutrition. Equally crucial is the provision of nutritious foods essential for maintaining their health. It is important that seniors make every bite count and prioritize protein and fiber-rich foods like oatmeal, beans, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Appetite can also diminish with age, so it is important that seniors have three meals a day and drink lots of water to stay hydrated. In Orange County, where one in four older adults grapples with food insecurity, the looming \\\"silver tsunami\\\" and surging grocery prices underscore the critical role of organizations like Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County and Meals on Wheels Orange County. To access support or aid a senior in need, individuals can visit feedoc.org/need-food or call 211 or the Orange County Office on Aging toll free at (800) 510-2020. Financial support is indispensable to sustain these essential programs, ensuring no senior goes hungry or feels forgotten in our community. You can also give your time by volunteering for Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County or Meals on Wheels Orange County. Together, let's recognize Senior Hunger Awareness Month with a reaffirmed commitment to senior nutrition and well-being and to safeguarding the health and dignity of Orange County's cherished elders. Holly Hagler is the president and CEO of Meals on Wheels Orange County, and Claudia Bonilla Keller is the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County.",
