    "text": "Husker team receives $5M grant to reduce methane emissions from cattle By Eric Buck University of Nebraska-Lincoln A Husker research team has received $5 million from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) to research more sustainable dairy and beef production. The research team is composed of [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) faculty members from the Department of Animal Science and Department of Biological Systems Engineering, along with researchers from the [U.S. Meat Animal Research Center ](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/clay-center-ne/marc/)in Clay Center, Nebraska. The team will study the interrelationships among animal genetics, the gut microbiome and nutrition, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and management practices that can lower methane emissions from livestock. The funding, which is through the USDA’s [National Institute of Food and Agriculture](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/), is part of the U.S. government’s $10 million investment toward projects reducing intestinal methane emissions from ruminant animals. The response aligns with President Joe Biden’s Global Methane Pledge made in September 2021. The project is led by Paul Kononoff, along with fellow Husker faculty Samodha Fernando, Matt Spangler, Galen Erickson, Jessica Sperber, Richard Stowell and Tammy Brown-Brandl. Additional researchers include James Wells and Bryan Neville from the Meat Animal Research Center. Ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep and goats have a digestive system containing microbes that break down plant materials and feed byproducts through fermentation. This process supplies vital nutrients to the animal while converting plants and other materials that humans are unable to digest into an important protein source. However, a byproduct of rumen fermentation is the creation of methane, a greenhouse gas. Cattle may produce between 200 and 500 liters of methane daily. Once produced, methane is then belched into the environment. The volume produced highly depends on an animal’s size and the feed consumed, as well as on its genetics and unique gut microbiome. “We’re developing a better understanding of the role of animal genetics and gut microbiome on not only methane production, but energy use and feed efficiency,” Kononoff said. Kononoff and his team will also investigate ways to establish a healthy microbiome in young animals that supports normal growth and production while reducing the amount of methane an individual animal produces. “This work will ensure that young animals get off to an even better start in life,” he said. The research results will be used to develop new tools and practices for producers to continue producing food while reducing methane production from the animals that they care for. It will also help producers make better breeding decisions and improve feed efficiency for their animals. These science-based solutions will be delivered to producers through university extension programs, aiding in the profitability and sustainability of family dairy and beef operations. “This is innovative, high-impact research that is going to point us in a direction where we will have a better understanding of the interconnected factors that impact methane production in cattle and build a more comprehensive understanding of cattle nutrition and performance,” said Derek McLean, dean and director of the Agricultural Research Division at Nebraska. Ultimately, Kononoff hopes the research improves efficiency and profitability for livestock producers, too. “Beef and dairy products are some of the most healthy, nutrient-dense and best-tasting foods we can enjoy,” he said. “This research should further support the many sustainable practices that beef and dairy producers currently employ in delivering food to consumers, opening new doors so that this food is produced in a manner that lessens the effect on the climate and Earth we all live on.”",

    "text": "Over the past two decades, the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) population has plummeted from more than 1,000 birds in the wild to less than 100, making it the most endangered bird in the continental United States. A turnaround may be in their future: The 1,000th captive-bred sparrow has just been released back into the wild. Before 2012, these unique birds were restricted to a few conservation areas and private ranches near the Kissimmee River. Federal and state agencies, universities, breeding facilities, and nonprofit organizations like Audubon responded by improving management activities, increasing research devoted to the sparrows, and starting a captive breeding program. At long last, the captive breeding program has been successful enough that Audubon and partners celebrated the release of the 1,000th Florida Grasshopper Sparrow on July 16 at Avon Park Air Force Range. “This is a hard-won milestone in Florida Grasshopper Sparrow conservation, and indeed in dry prairie conservation,” says Paul Gray, PhD, Everglades science coordinator for Audubon Florida. “I am immensely proud of our diverse team who, through thick and thin, have worked together to get here.” Audubon staff have been crucial team members throughout the reintroduction process, providing technical support to the agencies, funding field technicians, and securing funds to maintain captive breeding activities. The recently released juveniles give us hope that we can recover this wonderful endemic Florida bird and pave the way for further support of this critical program.",

    "text": "By Reuters ,\n2 hours ago\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -China's newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank earlier this year, a senior U.S. defense official said on Thursday, a potential embarrassment for Beijing as it seeks to expand its military capabilities.\nChina already has the largest navy in the world, with over 370 ships, and it has embarked on production of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines.\nA senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said China's new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June.\nA Chinese embassy spokesperson in Washington said they had no information to provide.\n\"We are not familiar with the situation you mentioned and currently have no information to provide,\" the Chinese official said.\nThe official said it was not clear what caused it to sink or whether it had nuclear fuel on board at the time.\n\"In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA's internal accountability and oversight of China's defense industry - which has long been plagued by corruption,\" the official said, using an acronym for the People's Liberation Army.\n\"It's not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal\" the sinking, the official added.\nThe news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nA series of satellite images from Planet Labs from June appear to show cranes at the Wuchang shipyard, where the submarine would have been docked.\nAs of 2022, China had six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a Pentagon report on China's military. That submarine force is expected to grow to 65 by 2025 and 80 by 2035, the U.S. Defense Department has said.\nOn Wednesday, China said it had successfully conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, a move likely to raise international concerns about the country's nuclear buildup.\nThe United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time earlier this month, amid efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings, especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Deepa Babington)\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

This innovative research aims to advance the study of oncology by creating synthetic patient data, thereby leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to overcome critical challenges, particularly in the study of rare cancers where traditional patient data is often unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nThe study, entitled, \"External Control Arm with Synthetic Real-world Data for Comparative Oncology using Single Trial Arm Evidence (ECLIPSE): A Case Study using Lung-MAP S1400I\" is led by Dr. Winson Cheung, Medical Advisor at Inka Health and Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, and brought together an esteemed team of oncology experts, including Inka Health co-founders Dr. Paul Arora and Dr. Alind Gupta, along with a consortium of world-renowned cancer researchers and private sector partners (Subsalt and Quantify Health). This exciting initiative seeks to develop synthetic patient cohorts using AI technology, a core element of digital twin technology, to address gaps in oncology research and accelerate clinical trial design by quickly generating comparator arms for trials. The Company believes that this is particularly critical in the rare cancer setting where randomizing patients to control arms (comparison groups without the new treatment)2 is often infeasible. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the pace and effectiveness of cancer treatments.\nThis study, led by Inka Health, has the potential to impact not only Onco-Innovation's cancer research but also the broader healthcare landscape by providing a scalable, data-driven solution to the challenges of studying rare and hard-to-treat cancers. As part of this ongoing initiative, Inka is working to expand its proprietary AI-driven platform, SynoGraph, which enhances patient stratification, improves clinical trial efficiency, and advances precision oncology solutions. By incorporating synthetic real-world data, SynoGraph aims to offer the pharmaceutical and biotech industries a powerful tool to speed up drug development and regulatory processes.\n\"The ability to create synthetic patient models using AI is an exciting milestone for oncology research. Traditional data limitations have long hindered progress, especially for rare cancers where patient data is scarce. With this technology, we can simulate diverse patient populations, with the potential to improve how clinical trials are designed,\" said Paul Arora, CEO of Inka Health.\n\"AI-driven synthetic patient models represent a potentially major leap in oncology research. By generating high-fidelity digital replicas of real patients, we can overcome data gaps that have historically slowed advancements, particularly for rare cancers and underrepresented populations. This approach has the potential to enhance clinical trial design, optimize treatment strategies, and accelerate the development of life-saving therapies, \" said Winson Cheung, Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary and Medical Advisor at Inka Health.\nAbout Onco-Innovations Limited\nOnco-Innovations is a Canadian-based company dedicated to cancer research and treatment, specializing in oncology.
