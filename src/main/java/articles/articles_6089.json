    "text": "Every couple of years and every major election cycle, voters are inundated with political ads, the usual talking points, and ballot measures. While some ballot measures are necessary, the default position we as voters should take is ‘Why am I being asked to vote on this now?' We should always assume that ballot measures are a last resort to circumvent the normal political processes we have in place and rely on, to serve our community day in and day out. In the case of a vacancy tax, our very own city council, the one we elected, decided to not move forward and voted it down earlier this year. Now, with Measure N on the ballot, a select group in our community is telling us that everyone must be wrong, including our own elected city council, everyone except them. I vote for my elected officials to do the job they campaign for - create and pass legislature as a group. They rightfully voted down a vacancy tax earlier this year, and I trust that they will continue to do the work we elect them to do, so we don’t have to waste our time legislating for them. Vote no on Measure N. - Brett Richardson A politically exhausted full time resident of South Lake Tahoe",

    "text": "Newswise — A new study shows thousands more patients diagnosed with\ncolorectal and endometrial cancers could benefit from immunotherapy than are currently offered it. Researchers showed the importance of looking at DNA Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMR-D) as a guiding marker for treatment decisions using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). MMR-D is associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer.\nThe study, which published in\nCancer Cell 00420-8)on December 28, compared two lab testing methods to diagnose cancers— traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) (a lab technique that uses antibodies to detect antigens in tissues) — and next-generation sequencing (NGS) — a new technology used for DNA sequencing that can detect specific patterns of mutations. The researchers discovered that NGS offers a more accurate assessment of MMR status.\n“We found that 1% of patients with colorectal cancer and 6% of patients with endometrial cancer are functionally mismatch repair-deficient but are still missed by IHC, the current standard of care testing,” said\nAmin Nassar, MD, the senior author of the study and member of Yale Cancer Center. “However, these cancers are detected by NGS. Importantly, we showed that these patients (missed by IHC and detected by NGS) achieved long-term benefit from immunotherapy. We recommend revisiting guidelines for mismatch repair testing to include both this NGS and IHC.”\nResearchers estimate that implementing NGS alongside IHC could identify an additional 6,000 patients in the United States annually who could benefit from life-extending immunotherapy. These patients would not be offered immunotherapy if IHC was used alone.\nThe researchers call for larger studies to further validate these findings in patients with colorectal and endometrial cancers and explore the application of NGS in other cancer types.\nNassar is a clinical fellow at Yale Cancer Center who did much of the work while he was a resident at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He was joined by first author Elias Bou Farhat, MD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\nMEDIA CONTACT\n[Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)",
