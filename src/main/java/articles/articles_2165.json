    "text": "As non-alcoholic beverages are on the rise, Drizly's head of consumer insights Liz Paquette joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the bullish trend. She points out that non-alcohol purchases on the platform are up 62% in 2023, solidifying “a trend that's here to stay” after the rapid growth.\nPaquette believes continued socialization after the pandemic will continue to drive demand. Since drinking alcohol is often associated with hosting and celebrations, consumers want options. She highlights non-alcohol beer as the top performer in the broader non-alcohol category, while spirit options are also starting to become popular.\nPaquette says consumers are looking for value, saying it's “extremely important to a purchase.”\nFor more expert insights and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\nvideo transcript\n[AUDIO LOGO]\nJulie Hyman: As we approach New Year's Eve, you may be checking your liquor shelves to stock up for parties, but a big trend in the refreshment space this year is non-alcohol beverages. There is increase. Drizly, the online ordering and delivery platform, is seeing its share of alcoholic beverages grow 62% from last year.\nFor more on this and what's happening in this area, we turn to Liz Paquette, Head of Consumer Insights at Drizly Liz, good to see you. I want to delve deeper into non-drinking, but first I want to ask you about the bigger picture, what has surprised you the most this year? I don't drink alcohol, I have noticed a big change. When you reflect on the year, what are the trends that surprise you the most?\nLiz Paquette: Sure, and thank you so much for having me. So in terms of what has surprised me the most this year, non-health is definitely one of those that has turned from an upcoming trend to a trend that is here to stay. This is something that consumers will continue to look for when they are hosting, celebrating, celebrating everyday occasions with friends and family.\nSo last year, non-ALC sales were up about 34%, this year they're up about 62%. And the thing that's largely driving this, interestingly, is that non-ALC beer is actually the number one subcategory specifically within the non-ALC category. However, we are seeing a huge uptick in spirits this year with sales in that category up 162%. Hence it has been found that consumers are looking to make more mocktails at home, which is largely a trend that is in line with the overall consumption within the Bev ALC category as well. Consumers have continued to make cocktails at home even after the pandemic, as they have created this new behavior.\nJosh Lipton: And Liz, I'm interested in consumers on your platform right now. How are they spending Liz? Are they– are they spending for more expensive beverages or turning to less expensive beverages?\nLiz Packett: Yes, absolutely price is a big indicator for consumers this year and something that is extremely important to purchasing. We see the delivery of the Bev ALC category to remain strong this year. However, consumers are citing value for money as one of the main indicators of what is important to them when making a purchase, and again we are seeing this reflected in average unit prices as well.\nSo specifically in the spirits category, while it's our number one best-selling category on the platform and we've actually seen some growth in the category year over year, we're seeing the average unit price actually increase year over year by almost 3%, and we're finding two variations within the price points that consumers are buying at.\nSo whereas in previous years, it was especially last year, it was over 40 that we had higher sales or a higher percentage of sales in this category. We are seeing consumers trading up a little bit more this year, particularly in the spirits category. And interestingly, in wine, we're seeing that people are actually trading a little bit more in this category than in spirits, so the average unit price in wine in particular is fairly stable year over year, and we Consumers are looking to buy at higher prices overall.\nSource: www.bing.com",

    "text": "Lightning is raining down on the UK for the second day in a row today, with humid weather cooking up severe conditions in the upper atmosphere that have unleashed across multiple regions. The Met Office has warned that, while the warnings for this week have expired, it may still impose short notice alerts as the warm weather that sparked earlier storms remains. The agency said earlier this week that there is a risk of &quot;isolated thunderstorm activity&quot;, with lightning maps capturing the leftover chaos sparked on Wednesday and Thursday. In a statement on Monday, the agency warned:&quot; It is likely that some warnings may need to be issued at short notice ahead of the development of the most intense thunderstorm activity. Hot conditions will remain, until a fresher and cooler influence begins from Friday.&quot; Follow where the lightning is now by look at this map Lightning map &quot;There is still the risk of isolated thunderstorm activity in the east or southeast of England but the frequency and impacts will be much reduced compared with Wednesday and Thursday.&quot; Charts from lightningmaps.org show that, over the last day, hundreds of flashes have been seen across the country as the stormy weather continues to swirl around England. The maps show that storms have touched the outskirts of London, in areas like Crawley, Guildford and Croydon, with systems largely skirting the city to the southwest and moving around Reading and Oxford. The map shows a major cluster around Basingstoke and Winchester, where several dozen lightning flashes have been reported. Beyond Oxford, lightning has been spotted towards the Midlands, around Peterborough, Northampton and Coventry, with other flashes seen briefly in and around the southwest. Storms produced some limited lightning around the border of England and Wales, to the west of Gloucester and as far west as Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. As the new month progresses, the Met Office has said that the early weeks will likely see &quot;changeable&quot; weather, with Atlantic-powered pressure powering rainy systems in the north, while the south sees &quot;fine, settled weather&quot;. The long-range forecast covering August 6 to 15 suggests there remains the possibility of further thunderstorms in the south. The forecast states: &quot;Areas further to the south are more likely to see ridges of higher pressure, bringing more in the way of fine, settled weather, though still with the potential for some wetter, thundery or more generally unsettled interludes.&quot;",

    "text": "« Depuis deux ans et demi, plus précisément depuis la formation du gouvernement actuel, les prix des matières premières et des produits de base pour notre industrie n’ont cessé de grimper». L’alerte est de nouveau donnée par la fédération nationale des propriétaires des cafés et restaurants au Maroc. Rien ne va plus dans le secteur, relève le quotidien L’Economiste dans son édition du vendredi 9 août.\nLa situation est qualifiée « d’insupportable», aussi bien pour les professionnels que pour les bourses de leurs clients. « Le prix de la viande rouge a augmenté de 60 à 140 dirhams le kilo, celui du poulet de 11 à 28 dirhams. Les tarifs du beurre sont passés de 35 à 120 dirhams, ceux des olives de 12 à 40 dirhams et de l’huile d’olive de 25 à 110 dirhams. Les prix des fruits ont aussi doublé », s’indignent les professionnels.\nDe même, le prix du café, produit de base dans leur activité, a augmenté de 100% en moins de 3 mois, ajoute la fédération. Celle-ci dénonce également la flambée des prix des carburants et autres produits essentiels. Pour certains, il n’y a plus de marge de bénéfice. « Pour d’autres, les recettes ont baissé de 40%», indique son président Noureddine El Harrak, cité par L’Economiste.\nLes propriétaires des cafés et restaurants alertent aussi sur la hausse de la taxe communale sur l’occupation de l’espace public dédié aux terrasses.\nDans un courrier, l’organisation professionnelle précitée interpelle le président du Conseil de la concurrence. Ils demandent une explication de cette flambée des prix qui se maintient. Des lettres seront envoyées aussi aux ministères des Finances et de l’Industrie et du Commerce. L’objectif est d’attirer l’attention des responsables gouvernementaux sur la crise que traverse le secteur.\n«La question suscite débat et inquiétude. Certains établissements ont augmenté leurs prix, d’autres sont dans l’expectative. Ces derniers attendent un retour à la normale de la situation économique. Ils ne veulent pas répercuter la hausse des prix des produits de base sur le client», indique Noureddine El Harrak. Et d’ajouter, « l’inflation a eu un impact très dur sur le pouvoir d’achat des citoyens. Leurs dépenses dans les cafés et restaurants ont baissé. A titre d’exemple, une famille habituée à dépenser 700 dirhams dans un restaurant ne dépasse pas 300 dirhams aujourd’hui ».\nPar Nabil Ouzzane Le 08/08/2024 à 20h52",

    "text": "The last two years exceeded on average a critical warming limit for the first time as global temperatures soar \"beyond what modern humans have ever experienced\", an EU agency said Friday.\nThis does not mean the internationally-agreed 1.5C warming threshold has been permanently breached, but the Copernicus Climate Change Service said it was drawing dangerously near.\nThe EU monitor confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023 and extending a streak of extraordinary heat that fuelled climate extremes on all continents.\nAnother record-breaking year is not anticipated in 2025, as climate sceptic Donald Trump takes office, and a deadline looms for nations to commit to deeper cuts to rising levels of greenhouse gases.\nBut the UK weather service predicts 2025 will still rank among the top three warmest years in the history books.\nThis excess heat supercharges extreme weather, and 2024 saw countries from Spain to Kenya, the United States and Nepal hit by disasters that cost more than $300 billion by some estimates.\nLos Angeles is battling deadly wildfires that have destroyed thousands of buildings and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. US President Joe Biden said the fires were the most \"devastating\" to hit California and were proof that \"climate change is real\".\nCopernicus said sustained, unprecedented warming made average temperatures over 2023 and 2024 more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times.\nNearly 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 that meeting 1.5C offered the best chance of preventing the most catastrophic repercussions of climate change.\nBut the world is nowhere on track to meeting that target.\n\"We are now teetering on the edge of passing the 1.5C level,\" said Copernicus climate deputy director Samantha Burgess.\n- Climate extremes - Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data, such as ice cores and tree rings, allow scientists to say the Earth today is likely the warmest its been in tens of thousands of years.\nThe 1.5C threshold is measured in decades, not individual years, but Copernicus said reaching this limit even briefly illustrated the unprecedented changes being brought about by humanity.\nScientists say every fraction of a degree above 1.5C is consequential, and that beyond a certain point the climate could shift in ways that are difficult to anticipate.\nMore from this section Australia frets over Meta halt to US fact-checking Fluoride May Be Linked to Decreased IQ, Says \"Limited Data,\" Hard-to-Interpret Study +3 Scientists uncover how deep sleep can cleanse your brain At present levels, human-driven climate change is already making droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves more frequent and intense.\nThe death of 1,300 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia from extreme heat, a barrage of powerful tropical storms in Asia and North America, and historic flooding in Europe and Africa marked grim milestones in 2024.\nThe oceans, a crucial climate regulator which absorb 90 percent of excess heat from greenhouse gases, warmed to record levels in 2024, straining coral reefs and marine life and stirring violent weather.\nWarmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier rainfall, feeding energy into cyclones and bringing sometimes unbearable humidity.\nWater vapour in the atmosphere hit fresh highs in 2024 and combined with elevated temperatures caused floods, heatwaves and \"misery for millions of people\", Burgess said.\n- 'Stark warning' - Johan Rockstrom of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said hitting 1.5C was a \"stark warning sign\".\n\"We have now experienced the first taste of a 1.5C world, which has cost people and the global economy unprecedented suffering and economic costs,\" he told AFP.\nScientists say the onset of a warming El Nino phenomenon in 2023 contributed to the record heat that followed.\nBut El Nino ended in early 2024, and scientists have puzzled over why global temperatures have remained at record or near-record levels ever since.\nIn December, the World Meteorological Organization said if an opposite La Nina event took over in coming months it would be too \"weak and short-lived\" to have much of a cooling effect.\n\"The future is in our hands -- swift and decisive action can still alter the trajectory of our future climate,\" said Copernicus climate director Carlo Buontempo.\nNations agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at a UN summit in 2023 but the latest meeting in November struggled to make any progress around how to make deeper reductions to heat-trapping emissions.\nnp-jmi/jm\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "title": "If you didn’t share a recap video, did 2023 even happen? - Anchorage Daily News",
    "text": "When Joseph Arujo, a 20-year-old content creator and student in Los Angeles, began seeing 2023 recap videos in his feed last month, he began scouring his hard drive for content. He hunted down old photos and videos and compiled them in a video for TikTok. 2023 recap videos were “everywhere,” he said. In yearly recap videos, you - or your friends, cousins, or people you barely know - string together dozens of videos and photos from the past 12 months, often set to the beat of a trending audio track. This new year, they’ve become an online phenomenon, allowing users an outlet to reflect while also generating anxiety and pressure among young people to commodify their lives into viral content. The trend also shows how the content formats and behavior of professional influencers are increasingly being adopted by average users. [@taylorlorenz] Who do we suddenly talk about our lives as “seasons”? And if you didn’t share a cinematic highlight reel, did 2023 even happen? Over the past several years apps and social platforms have given rise to the recap industrial complex. In 2016, an app called Top Nine went viral, allowing Instagram users to share a grid of their top 9 posts. That same year Spotify introduced Spotify Wrapped, a personalized round up of each user’s listening activity. Strava, a social fitness app, now provides users with an annual report of their fitness activity, and Goodreads, a platform for book lovers, offers a “Year in Books” feature summarizing users’ reading accomplishments. On TikTok, yearly recap videos became popular with high-profile content creators, eventually trickling down to average users. “You're getting a recap fed to you in every form of content,” said one creator. Yearly recap videos have become an online phenomenon, allowing users an outlet to reflect while also generating anxiety and pressure among young people to commodify their lives into viral content. The ideas that one should romanticize their life, be the main character and treat life like a movie have become commonplace on TikTok. So it’s no surprise that users would begin regurgitating their memories into cinematic edits. The explosion of 2023 recap videos shows, “the TikTokification of life,” said Kate Lindsay, co-founder of the internet culture newsletter Embedded. “New Year’s is already a reflective time, it’s a time to look back. And now social media takes it to the next level.” Read my full story in The Washington Post!! 🎆 [#capcut] [#tiktok] [#trends] [#culture] [#technology] [#tech] [#genz] [#content] [#contentcreator] [#influencer] [#commentary] [#womanintech] [#siliconvalley] [#apps] [#2023] [#2023recap] [#socialmedia] [#online] [#internetculture] [#CapCut] [♬ Clocks - Coldplay] “I think this phenomenon strongly relates to the sentiment that, ‘if you didn’t post it, is it even real?’” said Jules Terpak, a content creator who makes videos about digital culture. “People . . . not only have to document their years for others, but for their future selves to take in the significance of the year.” Videos including the hashtag #2023recap have amassed a collective 1.6 billion views on TikTok. “2023 recap” was listed as one of the most popular searches on Instagram in the days leading up to New Year’s Eve. Snapchat is incentivizing recap video creation by prompting users to create TikTok-like 2023 recap videos for the app. “Everyone wants to show their life looking the best that it can,” said Annie Wu Henry, a digital strategist in Philadelphia, “and that now includes . . . these videos.” Apps have begun making it easier to package the year into a digestible format for a while now. In 2016, an app called Top Nine went viral, allowing Instagram users to share a grid of their top 9 posts. That same year Spotify introduced Spotify Wrapped, a personalized round up of each user’s listening activity. Strava, a social fitness app, now provides users with an annual report of their fitness activity, and Goodreads, a platform for book lovers, offers a “Year in Books” feature summarizing users’ reading accomplishments. On TikTok, yearly recap videos became popular with high-profile content creators, eventually trickling down to average users. “You’re getting a recap fed to you in every form of content,” said Arujo. The ideas that one should romanticize their life, be the main character and treat life like a movie have become commonplace on TikTok. So it’s no surprise that users would begin regurgitating their memories into cinematic highlight reels. “We have democratized being a content creator where now even your aunt is posting an app downloaded slide show of videos that summarized her year,” said Luke Anderson, a producer in Los Angeles. The rise in 2023 recap videos shows, “the TikTokification of life,” said Kate Lindsay, co-founder of the internet culture newsletter Embedded. “New Year’s is already a reflective time, it’s a time to look back. And now social media takes it to the next level.” From a technical standpoint, highly produced recap videos are also becoming easier to create. CapCut, a video editing platform owned by ByteDance, provides easily replicable video creation formats that can be directly posted to TikTok, including several 2023 recap templates. “CapCut templates make it easier to create this content, period,” said Rachel Greenspan, a social media strategist in New York. Lindsay added that there are almost as many viral tutorials teaching users how to create their own 2023 recap videos, as the viral recap videos themselves. However as year-end recap videos have skyrocketed in popularity, the format has also led to increased pressure among users. Several people on social media told The Post that they felt frustrated and overwhelmed at the prospect of summarizing an entire year into engaging short-form content. Julia Metraux, a journalist in San Francisco said that she created a recap video only to delete it, worrying that the quality wasn’t up to par. Bryant Rodriguez, a content strategist in Southern California also said he also felt overwhelmed by the trend. After seeing the videos take over his feeds, he considered making his own. “I kept trying to come up with a plan for how to do it,” he said. “It ended up just creating more anxiety.” Rodriguez struggled with who and what to include in his roundup, and worried about offending a friend by leaving someone out. “Last year I didn’t feel this pressure,” he said. Leo Velazquez, a corporate trainer for an insurance company in Orange County, said that he witnessed a friend having a crisis over his 2023 recap video. His friend posted on Instagram Story saying that it took him 17 edits to create his final 2023 recap video after losing footage in between versions. Velazquez felt like the whole process seemed like too much, and since he hadn’t traveled much in 2023, he didn’t feel like he had any good content. “There’s so much effort into posting these videos,” he said. Those who did create videos, such as India Daykin, a brand manager in Vancouver, said that they did so mostly as a way to engage in a bit of nostalgia. “Even though these trends are kind of silly, it’s an interesting opportunity to force yourself to reflect on more positive moments throughout your year,” she said. While most 2023 recap videos are aspirational, filled with videos of partying, adventures, travel, and quality time with friends and loved ones, some TikTok users have leveraged the format to share low points in their lives in the past year, such as dealing with chronic illness or to reflect on the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the war in the Middle East. “I think with such lows [this year], even just surviving gives a bit of nostalgia,” Metraux said. As the format grows in popularity, meme pages have also begun to create recap videos focused on more outward facing world events. “There’s so much tragedy that happened this year from covid, to the earthquakes in Afghanistan, to the wildfires in Maui, to the situation in Gaza,” said the administrator of the Political Compass, a popular meme page on Instagram. “Literally so much has happened, and it seems like a recap video . . . is the best way to memorialize it all,” While CapCut makes creating yearly recap videos easier, Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist in San Francisco, said that soon AI tools may allow people to create such videos with the click of a button. He’s surprised that Instagram hadn’t already created an easy way to create recaps. “I feel like Instagram should give you a year in review like Spotify does,” he said. Others avoided posting their recap content on social media altogether, instead choosing to share highlights from the past year in person with family or a select group of friends. Jordan Lucero, a 17-year-old high school junior in Oklahoma City spent his New Year’s Eve displaying a month by month PowerPoint presentation recapping his past year to a group of friends. “People want to be more self-aware and reflect on stuff, and a lot of these things just get hidden away in our photo library,” he said. “I think it’s a positive thing to go back and process the year in a fun way.” Recaps can also provide a useful introduction to someone’s life. Lucero said that his friend had a new boyfriend, and he planned to show their yearly recap on New Year’s Eve. “We have to get him caught up on our lore,” Lucero said.

People Editorial Guidelines Published on May 23, 2024 04:55PM EDT Photo: Getty\nA priest was arrested after allegedly biting a woman during communion at a central Florida church.\nOfficers from the St. Cloud Police Department in Florida arrested a priest — identified as Father Fidel — after he allegedly had an altercation with a woman during Mass, according to local news sites WFTV , WKMG-TV and WDBO . According to the outlets, police have recommended that Fidel be charged with battery.\nThe incident happened at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church around 1:20 p.m. local time, according to a charging affidavit obtained by WKMG-TV. Police said that the woman had attended Mass to participate in her niece’s communion, but when she had gone up to receive the bread, the priest allegedly refused to give it to her claiming that she hadn’t completed the necessary steps to get it.\nHowever, the woman told the priest that she had done so and was “now accepted by God,” and the priest became upset and tried to stuff the bread in her mouth, per the affidavit obtained by WKMG-TV. The woman then tried to grab another piece in his hand, when he allegedly grabbed her and bit her arm, per the outlet.\nWoman Allegedly Shoots Father of Her 3 Children After Dispute Over Keys, Police Say “He tried to forcefully shove it in her mouth, she backed up,” one witness told police, per WFTV. “She said no don’t do that and she tried to get it and that is when he went crazy.”\nIn police body-cam footage obtained by the outlets, Fidel told police that the woman came to an earlier mass but didn’t understand the process of communion so he told her what steps she needed to take before she could do so, but she did not complete them.\nGetty\n“‘I am not judging you. I am asking you, ‘Did you confess after Mass?’ If you did not confess, I can’t give you communion,’ “ he recalled telling her, in the video obtained by WFTV.\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

I was defending myself and the sacrament,” he could also be seen saying.\nThe priest said that he acted in self-defense after he denied her communion since she pushed him and tried to grab the tray of bread out of his hands.\nSuspect Arrested in Shooting that Injured Auburn Player Brian Battie and Killed His Brother Tommie “[Father Fidel] advised that [she] pushed him and would not let go of the Communion tray, and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,” according to the charging affidavit.\nHowever, the woman accused the priest of singling her out due to her sexuality and attire in police footage obtained by WFTV. “He wouldn’t give me the cookie. I don’t know if it was the way I was dressed or what it is that I like,” she could be heard saying on video.\nThe St. Cloud Police Department and St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\nThe state will determine whether Fidel will be charged with battery, according to WKMG-TV.\nRelated Articles 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Actor Nicholas Brendon Arrested for Alleged Prescription Fraud Does Surveillance Video Show Aiden Fucci's Mom Washing Blood off Jeans After Cheerleader's Murder?
