    "title": "Israel rejects cease-fire talks and keeps up attacks in Lebanon",
    "text": "Israel ordered the military to maintain its bombardment of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and denied interest in a truce, a setback for efforts by the U.S. and allies to deescalate hostilities.\n“There will be no cease-fire,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X on Thursday. “We will continue to fight the Hezbollah terror group with full force until victory and the return of residents of the north to their homes.”\nKatz is standing in for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while the latter travels to the U.S., where he is due to address the annual United Nations summit on Friday. Netanyahu’s office said earlier that the Israel Defense Forces had been told to continue bombing Lebanon.\nThe push to secure a three-week cease-fire to win time for further negotiations is being led by U.S. President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The plan came as Israel prepared for a possible ground invasion, a move that would risk spiraling into a regional conflict that could drag in the U.S. and Iran, which backs Hezbollah.\nLebanon’s Economy Minister Amin Salam described the cease-fire proposal as “very serious” and said subsequent developments would be crucial. “We feel there is a lot of flexibility in the past 24 hours from Hezbollah’s side,” he told Bloomberg TV on Thursday. There was no immediate official response from the militant group.\nIsrael and Hezbollah remain deadlocked over the militant group’s determination to pursue cross-border rocket attacks as long as Israel maintains its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, the pan-Arab Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese official familiar with the matter. That conflict has been running since October of last year and there’s no sign an end is near.\nThe bid for a cease-fire in Lebanon comes as Israeli forces pounded targets in the economically stricken country for a fourth day, including on the outskirts of Beirut. More than 600 people, including at least 50 children, have been killed since Monday, with tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing the country’s south.\nHezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets at northern Israel in response — including its first-ever attempt to target Tel Aviv — in the worst violence between the two sides since a 2006 war.\nIsraeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported senior officials as saying they have their own conditions for a cease-fire that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is unlikely to agree to. Israel’s Army Radio, meanwhile, reported unidentified security officials saying the military needs more time to achieve its goal of degrading Hezbollah’s capabilities.\nThe U.S., European states and Arab powers including Saudi Arabia and Qatar urged a pause in fighting late Wednesday. “It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety,” they said in a joint statement.\nThe Lebanon proposal is intended to eventually lead to the return of tens of thousands of Israelis who have left their homes in the north to escape rocket attacks from Hezbollah, which began shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Lebanon Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib has said half a million people have been displaced inside the country by the Israeli bombardment.\nIn the past week, Israel has significantly stepped up air attacks. The military has killed top Hezbollah commanders with strikes, and many members were maimed in an operation in which thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded. Hezbollah and Iran blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. Israel says it has destroyed a significant part of Hezbollah’s missile arsenal.\nOne of Netanyahu’s far-right allies, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, threatened to quit the ruling coalition if a permanent truce is reached in Lebanon. Such a move could bring down the government.\nIsrael’s political opposition also indicated little enthusiasm for the cease-fire proposal.\nNaftali Bennett, a former prime minister who’s likely to challenge Netanyahu at elections, said on X that the time is not right. “If Hezbollah wants the fire to stop, it can lay down its arms, demilitarize itself and move 15 km away from the Israeli border,” he said.\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid, meanwhile, said a pause should last no more than seven days to prevent Hezbollah from regaining its military footing.\nU.S. efforts of a diplomatic breakthrough to end fighting in Gaza have been repeatedly dashed. Domestic critics of Netanyahu have accused him of delaying a truce because of the need to placate his far-right government allies such as Ben Gvir. Iran-backed Hamas, which like Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., has taken a similarly uncompromising line, despite the destruction of much of its military capability.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been working on the cease-fire proposal all week in New York, according to a U.S. official familiar with the process.\n(With assistance from Galit Altstein, Alisa Odenheimer, Iain Marlow, Ellen Milligan, Samy Adghirni, Augusta Saraiva, Golnar Motevalli and Omar Tamo.)\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

    "title": "Illinois state parks install electric vehicle charging stations | STLPR",
    "text": "Illinois state parks, including some near St. Louis, now have electric vehicle chargers Four Illinois state parks now have public charging stations for electric vehicles, including three within driving distance of St. Louis. An additional 40 chargers will be placed at other widely used public areas in the state as part of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources’ goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The public stations are also meant to make it easier for people with electric vehicles to drive across and around Illinois, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said at Frank Holten State Park in East St. Louis on Thursday. “If you're coming from Chicago and going to St. Louis, for example, we need all the charging along the way to go to St Louis, even if we're not responsible for the ones in St. Louis,” Pritzker said. The Level 2 chargers were donated to the department by EVBox, an electric vehicle charger manufacturer based in Illinois. Natalie Phelps Finnie, the agency's director, said the charging stations will encourage more electric vehicle drivers to visit Illinois’ parks and historic sites. “Our hope is that visitors and tourists will stop at an Illinois state park, have a picnic, or hike a trail where their car charges for a couple of hours before they head to their next destination, and hopefully their experience is delightful enough that they'll tell their friends about it,” Finnie said. Finnie added that there is a growing demand for EV chargers in rural and underserved communities that the department is working to fulfill. There are about 120,000 registered electric vehicles in Illinois. By 2030, the state wants to increase that to 1 million. Making chargers more accessible is key to reaching that goal, said Lisa Clement Stott, electric mobility and innovation director of the state Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. A [2023 AAA survey](https://newsroom.aaa.com/2023/11/annual-electric-vehicle-sentiment-survey/#:~:text=However%2C%20cost%20(59%25)%2C,unlikely%20to%20buy%20an%20EV.) found that 53% of travelers said a lack of charging stations is the primary barrier preventing them from buying an electric vehicle. “Charging fear is real,” Stott said. “Range anxiety is real, but here in Illinois, we're continuously working to ensure this will soon be a concern of the past.” The department installed charging stations at Frank Holten State Park in East St. Louis, Eldon Hazlet State Recreation Area near Carlyle, Washington County State Recreation Area near Nashville and Jim Edgar Panther Creek State Fish and Wildlife Area in Cass County in central Illinois. The installations can fully charge a car in 4-10 hours, depending on the vehicle, while drawing about the same power as a clothes dryer, said Dan Fedor, a business manager with EVBox. Fedor said he wants to see Illinois continue to lead electric vehicle and charger production. “The desire and the need to mitigate climate change is stronger than ever in times of disaster,” Fedor said. “Eventually we can be completely off the grid in terms of how we're powering our vehicles.” At an unveiling of the charging station in Frank Holten State Park, state Rep. Kevin Schmidt, R-Cahokia Heights, said his district has been plagued by environmental racism. Adding the charging station and incentivizing more people to switch to electric cars can help lower Cahokia Height’s carbon footprint, he added. “To see that electric charging station and to know that we're going in the right direction and that we're being kind to Mother Earth … will yield a ton of benefits for us all,” Schmidt said.",
