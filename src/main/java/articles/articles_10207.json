    "text": "My faith was largely invisible growing up. I don’t wear a hijab, and my town had very little Muslim presence. By the time the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened, my Pakistani immigrant parents were well settled in the states, with three small children. I’d go to public school and then come home to my evening Quran lessons. As a first generation Pakistani American, I was aware of the divide between my life outside the home and inside the home; having “two lives,” so to speak, just came with the territory. As a first generation Pakistani American, I was aware of the divide between my life outside the home and inside the home. At some point after Sept. 11, 2001, that divide began to converge in more apparent ways. Ignorant Islamophobic hate erased and contradicted the core teachings of peace at the center of Islam. Without mainstream visibility or the equalizing power of platforms like social media, Muslims, [especially immigrants](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/#three-quarters-of-u-s-muslims-are-immigrants-or-the-children-of-immigrants), felt siloed and powerless to defend themselves and their faith. Five years after the terror attacks, my parents, grandparents, siblings and I were stopped at the U.S.-Canada border driving home from a summer vacation in Toronto. My father, a federal employee, disappeared through a separate door with the officers, while the rest of us huddled restlessly in a waiting room. About three hours later, we were back on the road. The problem? My father’s name: “Muhammad.” This kind of blatant profiling might go viral on social media today. But this was 2006, the same year the first Muslim was elected to Congress. To date, America has elected only four Muslim lawmakers, including Congress’ sole Palestinian American, [Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who was censured](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/rep-rashida-tlaib-responds-to-house-censure-vote-197433413657) by her peers in November for her criticism of Israel. Nearly 20 years later, Muslim Americans are still fighting many of the same battles. Indeed, 2023 was defined in part by spikes in bigotry [targeting both Muslims](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/islamophobic-remarks-members-congress-betray-american-values-n1287120) and [Jews](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/a-rise-in-antisemitism-in-the-u-s-is-a-problem-for-all-people-says-attorney-198292037820) following Hamas’ terrorist attack on Oct. 7. The subsequent murder of 6-year-old [Wadea Al-Fayoume](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/stabbing-hate-crime-illinois-wadea-al-fayoume-rcna120624), and the [shooting of three Palestinian and Palestinian American men](https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/three-palestinian-men-going-to-family-dinner-shot-in-vermont-198760517738) in Burlington, Vermont, were frightening reminders of the deadly impact of [Islamophobic rhetoric.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/technology/hate-speech-israel-gaza-internet.html) On Oct. 25, [the Council on American Islamic Relations reported](https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-reports-sharp-increase-in-complaints-reported-bias-incidents-since-107/) receiving “774 complaints, including reported bias incidents, since the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine on Oct. 7,” adding that the “number of complaints is the largest wave of complaints CAIR has received in a similar time period since then-candidate Donald Trump first announced his desire to implement a Muslim ban.” Meanwhile, Trump has retaken the campaign stage and is once again using the politics of rage and xenophobia to garner support. But while the hate may feel sadly familiar, the Muslim American community’s ability to counter and disarm that bigotry highlights something more hopeful. Visibility is a key part of this progress. The [Pew Research Center estimates](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/) that Muslims in the U.S. increased from 2.35 million in 2007 to 3.45 million in 2017. The millennial children of Muslim immigrants can be found in politics, in the media and across the cultural landscape. [Muslim creatives](https://www.msnbc.com/the-mehdi-hasan-show/watch/how-ramy-is-rewriting-the-narrative-on-muslim-representation-150341701638) are communicating our humanity through television, movies and books. This new generation also feels more empowered to tell their own stories and push back against harmful stereotypes, such as the documentary directed by a Muslim American filmmaker, “ [36 Seconds: A Portrait of a Hate Crime](https://www.36secondsfilm.com/),” about the killings of three young Muslims in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the film, former Obama White House staffer Rumana Ahmed explained how she used her identity as a Muslim to get higher ups to acknowledge the Islamophobic aspects of the tragedy and push for [an official statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/chapel-hill-north-carolina-shootings-obama-calls-slayings-outrageous-n305936). The Israel-Hamas war has led to a mini-resurgence of hate. But “an unprecedentedly Islamophobic administration,” as the [Brennan Justice Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/islamophobic-administration) defined Trump’s first term, was a turning point for many Muslim activists and advocates. After the 2016 election, the [Los Angeles Times reported](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-09-08/la-na-muslim-voters-presidential-election) a surge in Michigan’s Muslim voter participation, as well as Muslims running for local office. In 2023, Muslim voters once again used their political power to send a message, as [swing-state Muslim Americans threatened to vote against Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/swing-state-muslim-voters-threaten-vote-against-biden-rcna122870) over his Israel policy. Social media has also given Muslims, as it has so many marginalized communities, new ways to highlight injustice and [fight for accountability](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-obama-administration-official-recorded-taunting-nyc-food-vendor-isl-rcna126347). Obviously, this is a problem that cannot be easily solved. Trump is now talking about [reimposing his travel ban](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/recycling-worst-ideas-trump-eyes-new-travel-ban-rcna119677) on primarily Muslim countries, and other prominent Republicans are also incorporating Islamophobia into their talking points. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis minimized anti-Muslim hate on the GOP presidential debate stage with his [“so-called Islamophobia” sneer. ](https://www.msnbc.com/2024-election/live-blog/republican-debate-live-updates-rcna122375/rcrd25177?canonicalCard=true) Even so, I’m heartened by the displays of support I’ve seen this year. Muslims are holding one another up and using the power of community and congregation for peaceful demonstrations — like [a Jummah (Friday) prayer on the National Mall](https://twitter.com/YasmineTaeb/status/1715409008993989047) voicing support for a cease-fire in Gaza. Amid a painful news cycle, I have become more active at my local mosque, praying shoulder to shoulder with the kindest strangers. Together we grieve and pray for peace. Many of us no longer feel pressured to live two lives and instead are able to embrace community-building. I’ve even seen non-Muslims on TikTok opening the Quran to educate themselves and encouraging others to do the same. (One particularly viral ally, [Megan Rice, ended up converting to Islam after starting a Quran book club.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/20/palestine-quran-islam-americans-tiktok)) Muslims have created a space on the internet for themselves and translated that into a meaningful public presence at a time we need to stand together against Islamophobia. My faith no longer feels invisible like it once was, and I can tell the stories my family has for decades felt too scared to share.",

    "title": "Illinois became the first state to eliminate cash bail. Here’s how it’s working.",
    "text": "Illinois became the first state to eliminate cash bail. Here’s how it’s working.\nOfficials in Cook County say implementation has been seamless, but the new policy put a strain on resources elsewhere in Illinois.\nLavette Mayes still feels the effects of her pre-trial detention in Cook County Jail, even though it’s been eight years.\nMayes spent 14 months behind bars, awaiting trial for an aggravated battery charge after a fight with a family member. The judge had set her bond at $250,000 during a 30-second court hearing, and Mayes couldn’t come close to paying the 10% up front it would take to be released.\nBecause of her jail stay, she lost her new, small business, almost lost custody of her two kids and had to move back into her childhood home.\nNow, Mayes is an activist with the Chicago community bond fund, the same group that helped pay her bail securing her pretrial release. She was ecstatic when Illinois became the first state to abolish cash bail three months ago.\n“People need to see this, because our kids are coming behind this,” Mayes said. “We can’t leave [the old system] to them.”\nThe controversial change was hotly contested — and still is — with supporters saying the new system protects lower-income defendants like Mayes from being discriminated against, and opponents decrying a destabilizing shift they warn would cause a spike in crime.\nIllinois’ historic pretrial reform has largely passed its first test, with no major scandals and no immediate impact on crime trends. Implementation has been mostly smooth as well, although uneven.\nIn Cook County, the change was supported by leaders and was an extension of reforms already in place. But officials in smaller, downstate counties have been stretched thin by the requirements of the new system.\nA risk of uneven implementation, unequal justice\nCook County Judge Mary Marubio said the transition to the new system has been quite smooth. She serves as a supervising judge of the pretrial division.\n“It’s not that different than it’s always been,” Marubio said. “It’s just that money is no longer one of the conditions that’s ordered.”\nMarubio said they offer a wide range of pretrial services intended to help people get to their next court date, including transportation to the downtown courthouse. They’ll also send out text alerts and make phone calls to people reminding them of their court date.\n“We have a very large staff,” Marubio said. “We have plenty of clerks, we have sheriffs, we have fully trained State’s Attorneys and public defenders. We have a specific new public defender unit for this. So I think we’re in really good shape.”\nBut about 240 miles south in Macoupin County, officials are feeling the difference.\nState’s Attorney Jordan Garrison heads an office of just four staffers. His team, plus two people appointed by the state, are in charge of monitoring people released pretrial, which he said has been at least 20 people per month since cash bail was eliminated.\n“It’s a significant burden to try to track that many people, especially in a rural community that doesn’t have much resources,” Garrison said.\nGarrison said to make the best use of what little resources they have, they have to focus on tracking people with more serious offenses — but that means people with much more common, lower-level charges like burglary and drug possession might slip through the cracks.\n“Eventually, we will have to hire more staff,” Garrison said. “Unfortunately, that’s just not available.”\nGarrison said even if they had more money, there aren’t attorneys available to hire. Macoupin County is part of Illinois’ Fourth Judicial District. It includes 41 counties in central Illinois. This year, only\n55 new lawyers were sworn in in the Fourth District, fewer than one-and-a-half attorneys per county.\nAlison Shames, director at the Maryland-based Center for Effective Policy and an advisor to Illinois’ statewide task force on implementing the new system, said counties need to feel supported to do this new system justice.\n“What we can’t let happen is for this to be implemented in very inconsistent ways, or not implemented at all, right?” Shames said. “Because then you’re gonna end up with a system of very unequal justice.”\nWhich, Shames said, goes against the spirit of the law.\nJail populations fall throughout the state\nWhen Illinois eliminated cash bail, many predicted an increase in\nthe use of electronic monitoring — a way to keep tabs on a defendant without keeping them locked up.\nGeorge Washington Law Professor Kate Weisburd said in other states that have implemented bail reforms, like California and Texas, the use of ankle monitors has gone up while jail populations decreased. She said an increased reliance on monitoring isn’t “moving the ball forward when it comes to pretrial justice.”\n“I think what makes the [Illinois law] so powerful is that judges are required to release people who are deemed not to be a safety risk, and not likely to flee,” Weisburd said. “So that means that most people released under this new law don’t need to have an electronic monitor, because they’re not a safety risk, and they’re not a flight risk.”\nDavid Olson said so far there hasn’t been an increase in the use of electronic monitoring in Illinois. Olson is a law professor specializing in criminal justice and criminology at Loyola University in Chicago.\nHe said three months is not enough time to determine what impact the new system is having on crime rates. But he and his team are hitting the road soon to see how the law is playing out throughout the state.\nOne thing they have seen already, though, is the elimination of bail has driven down jail populations across Illinois. But how drastic the decrease varies by the size of the county.\n“In some of the smaller more rural jails, where historically people might have been held for offenses that are not detainable, the decreases in the jail populations have been larger than in some of the larger jails, where the majority of people held in jail are those charged with more serious offenses,” Olson said.\nOne of those smaller jails is in McLean County, which includes Bloomington-Normal. Assistant State’s Attorney Brad Rigdon said some of the most common charges in his area are misdemeanor assault.\n“Unless the person caused bodily harm, we can’t file a petition to detain [them], then a judge is not allowed to order somebody held in jail,” Rigdon said. “That’s a serious problem, because there are plenty of instances of violence where it’s a progression that works its way up.”\nMcLean County was one of the over 60 counties represented in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of eliminating cash bail. Rigdon says, in an ideal world, he would like to see the new law eliminated.\n“However, we are stuck with it now,” Rigdon said. “The best we can hope for is to make it better.”\nMaine bars Trump from ballot as U.S. Supreme Court weighs states’ authority to block former president",
