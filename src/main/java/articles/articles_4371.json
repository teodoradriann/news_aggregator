    "title": "Artigianato e Made in Italy: al via il Seminario Estivo di Symbola",
    "text": "Mantova, 12 giu. (askanews) – L’artigianato rappresenta il cuore pulsante della manifattura italiana e, di conseguenza, del Made in Italy. Sebbene le imprese artigiane costituiscano il 21,3% del totale delle attività produttive, la loro incidenza è particolarmente significativa nel settore manifatturiero – dove raggiunge il 58,5% del totale delle imprese – e in particolare in alcuni comparti chiave come il legno, l’alimentare, l’abbigliamento, la meccanica. E’ questo il messaggio che arriva dalla campagna di comunicazione “Artigianato, futuro del made in Italy” che si conclude oggi a Mantova in occasione dalla giornata di apertura del Seminario Estivo di Fondazione Symbola. “Artigianato, futuro del made in Italy” è un’iniziativa promossa da Confartigianato, CNA, Casartigiani insieme a Fondazione Symbola e con il patrocinio del MiMit, nell’ambito della Giornata del Made in Italy, per rendere visibile l’importanza dell’artigianato italiano per la nostra economia, ma anche per la nostra qualità della vita. In Italia, oltre un milione di imprese sono artigiane, una cifra pari a circa un quarto di tutto il sistema imprenditoriale italiano.\nConfrontando i quinquenni 2015-2019 e 2019-2023 si evidenzia una crescita della quota di micro e piccole imprese che hanno effettuato investimenti green, rispettivamente +23,2% e +45,9%. Queste imprese sono oltre mezzo milione (503.258): il 67% opera nei servizi, il 33% nell’industria, il 18% nell’industria manifatturiera, il 14% nelle costruzioni, solo l’1% nelle public utilities. Nel 2024 il 61,3% delle entrate di green jobs programmate in Italia sono relative a micro e piccole imprese.\nMicro e piccole imprese sono il motore della cultura e della creatività italiana. Guardando ai settori culturali e creativi, queste rappresentano il 99,7% degli operatori. Un dato medio che va dai settori del software e videogames dove la quota di operatori attivi nelle micro e piccole imprese rappresenta il 98,4%.\nL’artigianato non è solo una colonna portante della produzione, ma anche un motore di sviluppo economico e benessere territoriale. Le micro e piccole imprese rappresentano, in molti territori, l’unico presidio sociale ed economico. Nei piccoli comuni (meno di 5 mila abitanti) le micro e piccole imprese rappresentano il 99,4% delle imprese extra-agricole presenti nel territorio. Andando ad analizzare la distribuzione delle micro e piccole imprese per area geografica, i piccoli comuni del Nord-ovest concentrano la quota maggiore (38,7%), seguiti da Mezzogiorno (29,5%), Nord-est (19,6%) e Centro (12,2%).\nLe 100 imprese coinvolte nella campagna raccontano di un artigianato italiano in trasformazione, che mantiene vive le sue radici nella tradizione, pur aprendosi con determinazione all’innovazione e alle nuove sfide del mercato globale. 100 realtà protagoniste della campagna provenienti da tutta Italia: 49 dal Nord, 20 rappresentano le regioni centrali, 31 raccontano il Sud della penisola.\n“Parlando di piccole imprese e artigianato alcuni pensano ad un punto di debolezza della nostra economia. Non è così. La propensione delle imprese artigiane – sottolinea Ermete Realacci, presidente della Fondazione Symbola – a collaborare accompagna la nostra capacità di creare coesione e innovazione. L’artigianato è un’anima del Made in Italy. Questo report comunica attraverso i numeri il valore di questo sistema che alimenta la capacità di affrontare le sfide del futuro legate all’innovazione e alla sostenibilità. La foto che emerge conferma che il Paese può affrontare le sfide che abbiamo avanti chiamando a raccolta i nostri talenti senza lasciare indietro nessuno. E che come scritto nel Manifesto di Assisi non c’è nulla di sbagliato in Italia che non possa essere corretto con quanto di giusto c’è in Italia. Come ha detto Papa Francesco ‘Siamo chiamati ad essere creativi, come gli artigiani, forgiando percorsi nuovi ed originali per il bene comune'”.\n[Realacci: “Motore di sviluppo economico e benessere territoriale”|PN_20250612_00022|gn00 sp35|https://askanews.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250612_101203_7A4847BA.jpg|12/06/2025 10:12:14|Artigianato e Made in Italy: al via il Seminario Estivo di Symbola|Made in Italy|Cronaca, Sostenibilita’]",

    "text": "In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Oklahoma State University have discovered significant variations in drought tolerance among advanced turf-type Bermudagrass genotypes. This research, pivotal in environmental management and turfgrass breeding, could lead to more sustainable landscaping practices in drought-prone regions. Understanding Drought Tolerance in Bermudagrass The study evaluated the drought response of [various Bermudagrass genotypes](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-experimental-bermudagrasses-varied-drought-response.html) under controlled conditions. Bermudagrass is a critical component of the American landscape, covering over 31 million acres as the nation's largest irrigated crop. It's extensively used in sports fields, golf courses, and lawns, particularly in the southern United States and transition zones where drought can be challenging. Researchers conducted their experiments in Stillwater, Oklahoma, a region increasingly affected by water scarcity and droughts. The findings revealed that specific experimental genotypes, such as OSU1221 and \"TifTuf,\" exhibited superior performance under acute drought conditions. These genotypes showed remarkable resilience, maintaining turf quality and root health despite prolonged periods without water. Implications for Turf Management and Water Conservation The identification of these drought-resistant genotypes is a significant step forward for turfgrass breeders and environmental managers. With water conservation becoming a critical issue worldwide, the ability to select and cultivate drought-resistant turfgrass species is not just essential, but it also empowers you to make a significant impact on sustainable resource management. The study suggests that developing Bermudagrass with extensive root systems and higher root-to-shoot ratios could enhance drought performance. Genotypes like \"TifTuf\" and OSU1221 not only adapt well to prolonged drought stress but also promise to transform turf management practices. This offers new solutions for maintaining green spaces in the face of water scarcity, instilling a sense of hope and optimism in the face of a pressing global challenge. This research underscores the importance of selecting the right turfgrass species and cultivars as a primary strategy in water conservation efforts. As the global human population grows, the need for sustainable landscaping solutions becomes ever more pressing. The work done by the Oklahoma State University team provides valuable insights that could help meet these challenges head-on, ensuring that you are prepared and confident in your ability to contribute to a sustainable future.
