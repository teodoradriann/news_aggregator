    "text": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes [will shift away from military commanders](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190731402/military-code-sexual-assault-biden-gillibrand) to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's [Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military](https://www.sapr.mil/sites/default/files/public/docs/reports/AR/FY22/DOD_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military_FY2022.pdf) showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3627334/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-offices-of-special/), Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the [National Institute of Military Justice](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nimj.org/__;!!Iwwt!UbPCvSmbGISuvrCLw1BPxxJS6qOL83gyaz8yBDSEXfcqUNpX0M2GK3oeNrdji2ifc4zOhakHQBUDl2_hTJPlMVGkag$), said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will still be handled by those in the chain of command who are no longer trusted to decide whether to charge murder or rape. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias, then this is all for naught.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Kia Bickham calls it \"working across differences.\" As the Director of Engagement for E Pluribus Unum , she's one of many attendees at the Hampton Roads Social Justice Conference. Bickham's organization equips communities across the South with the resources to bridge divides and foster connections. It's one of the many organization doing just that at the social justice conference hosted by Christopher Newport University. \"Across all spectrums of differences, different beliefs, ideologies, different topics of interest. You may have someone here interested in housing, another interested in economic mobility. How do they intersect and what does that look like?\" said Bickham. The conference aims to bring activists, organizations, scholars, community leaders and more together to learn from each other in pursuit of social justice and equity. That communication across sectors highlights the need to shared strategies, strategies that often times apply to shared root causes. Kenneth Hunter is an organizer for the Virginia Consensus for Higher Education in Prison . He's aiming to expand access to college education for people incarcerated. A speaker at the conference, he says the interconnectedness helps with solving a wide range of problems. \"Inequity permeates the same communities in the same way. If we look at the problems in that way, then we find ways to address it from its root, from its foundation,\" said Hunter. It's the fourth annual version of the event, and over 400 attendees will be present over the two-day conference.",

It was revealed earlier this week how Dreamers on Victoria Street has lodged an application with Liverpool Council to extend its opening hours until the early hours of the morning.\nThe business has made a second attempt to keep its doors open later having initially been granted a sexual entertainment venue (SEV) licence in April 2023. However, this has prompted a backlash from a senior councillor representing the area in which the bar is located.\n‌\nCllr Nick Small, Labour member for City Centre North, has issued an objection to the plans and is calling on Merseyside Police to oppose the proposals. Two years ago, the city council's licensing and gambling sub-committee signed off on an application by Meshach Harris to operate the gentleman's club until 2am.\n‌\nThis came after a £150,000 refurbishment to provide for up to 80 patrons a night. Cllr Small has now released a letter indicating he would not back any extension of the terms.\nHe wrote: \"I have…\nDavid Humphreys",

    "title": "Oración a la Sagrada Familia del Papa Francisco",
    "text": "El 31 de diciembre celebramos la fiesta de la Sagrada Familia, ejemplo de santidad para matrimonios, padres, hijos y todo cristiano que buscan servir a Dios. En 2016 el Papa Francisco publicó la exhortación apostólica sobre el amor en la familia, [Amoris Laetitia](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/es/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20160319_amoris-laetitia.html), que finaliza con una profunda oración a José, María y Jesús. El documento inicia afirmando que «la alegría del amor que se vive en las familias es también el júbilo de la Iglesia» y nos recuerda que podemos, no solo imitar el ejemplo de la [ Sagrada Familia](/2020/01/14/3-cosas-que-podemos-aprender-de-la-sagrada-familia/), sino pedir su intercesión y acudir a ellos en nuestros momentos de discernimiento, angustia, dolor y educación de los hijos: «En el tesoro del corazón de María están también todos los acontecimientos de cada una de nuestras familias, que ella conserva cuidadosamente. Por eso puede ayudarnos a interpretarlos para reconocer en la historia familiar el mensaje de Dios» (Amoris Laetitia, 30) Oración a la Sagrada Familia Jesús, María y José en vosotros contemplamos el esplendor del verdadero amor, a vosotros, confiados, nos dirigimos. Santa Familia de Nazaret, haz también de nuestras familias lugar de comunión y cenáculo de oración, auténticas escuelas del Evangelio y pequeñas iglesias domésticas. Santa Familia de Nazaret, que nunca más haya en las familias episodios de violencia, de cerrazón y división; que quien haya sido herido o escandalizado sea pronto consolado y curado. Santa Familia de Nazaret, haz tomar conciencia a todos del carácter sagrado e inviolable de la familia, de su belleza en el proyecto de Dios. Jesús, María y José, escuchad, acoged nuestra súplica. Amén. ¿Qué dice Amoris Laetitia sobre la familia?
