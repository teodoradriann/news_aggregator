Pounding that familiar pavement, she said, always helps.\n\"I think getting on the course, feeling the hills and sort of picturing and visualizing what it will be like on race day sort of sets the tone,\" said Linden.\nThis year's Boston Marathon will be run on Monday, April 21.\nWCVB is the exclusive broadcast partner of the marathon and the Boston Athletic Association.",

    "title": "Senior Chinese Officials Quit the Chinese Communist Party | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) I’ve been practicing Falun Dafa for more than 10 years. I truly experienced that Master Li Hongzhi (Falun Dafa’s founder) compassionately protects practitioners to [clarify the truth] and awaken all beings. At the end of 2005, I went to another city to help care for my grandson. Every day, after taking my grandson to kindergarten, I distributed [truth-clarification] materials. I was reported by people who did not know the truth about Falun Dafa, and a dozen policemen took me to the police station. Five officers then took me back to the place of my arrest and attempted to take pictures of me as evidence. However, not a single picture was successfully taken after half a day. Two days later, they brought two new cameras with them to retake pictures of me, but they also failed. The officers finally resorted to a Polaroid instant camera, which only printed blank paper, and that was the end of it. They also were unable to obtain my fingerprints after five attempts. I was later sentenced to three years in prison. Upon my arrival at the prison, the guards took my picture, but the image was blank. The guards left without saying anything. In September 2006, more than 20 officials and officers tried to pressure me to sign a [guarantee statement] that I would give up the practice. I firmly declared, “I won’t agree to it even if I die.” Despite my resistance, they forcibly took my hand and signed a pre-written statement. I cried when I returned to my cell. After a while, I unintentionally pulled open my drawer and discovered that the statement I had just signed was there! I hurriedly took it out and destroyed it. The police later rummaged through the prison looking for the statement. Throughout those three years in prison, I managed to eliminate my attachment to fear. Consequently, I fearlessly confronted the perpetrators and rationally talked to them about Falun Dafa. A fellow practitioner once told me that telling high-ranking officials the truth about the persecution was challenging. However, I believe this difficulty stems from our human notions. In my experience, I found that these high-ranking officials often possess a deeper understanding of the truth behind the persecution than the general public. They are more aware of the corruption within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Yet, constrained by the oppressive CCP system, they are compelled to conceal their true thoughts. As long as we follow Master Li’s request to study the [Fa] well, remember our missions at all times, and do the [three things] with a pure heart, he will arrange for people with a predestined relationship to come to us to hear the truth about Dafa. I have encountered many senior officials over the years and here are just a few experiences. Secretary of the Regional Party Committee I once noticed a well-dressed man sitting alone, enjoying tea in a scenic spot. I approached him and asked, “Brother, may I sit here and rest for a while?” He looked at me and replied, “Go ahead.” “Thank you! You seem like a senior official.” He smiled and inquired, “How can you tell that I’m a senior official?” “I observe an extraordinary temperament in you. You also appear trustworthy and empathetic.” He smiled back. I asked, “Can I have your opinion about Falun Dafa?” He glanced around to ensure no one else could hear before responding, “You are a Falun Dafa practitioner?” I said yes. He shared that he and his family had read [Zhuan Falun] (the main text of Falun Dafa) and found it to be very good. He said he knew that Jiang Zemin, the former leader of the Chinese Communist regime, was responsible for the persecution. More importantly, he emphasized that he had never taken part in the persecution. I remarked, “I recognize that you are a good official. Wasn’t I right? Brother, can I help you quit the CCP?” He readily agreed. After a pause, he inquired, “Can you help my family members quit the CCP and its affiliated organizations?” I replied, “I will. Can you inform them about our conversation today so they will understand the facts of Falun Dafa?” “My family members already know that Falun Dafa is good. I’ve advised them not to participate in the persecution.” He then provided me with his family members’ names, addresses, and phone numbers, saying, “If you encounter any difficulties, just call me, and I will certainly help you.” At that moment, a friend of his arrived. He introduced me to his friend: “This sister is a good person who practices Falun Dafa.” His friend nodded in agreement and greeted me. He, too, chose to quit the CCP. They both wished me well and expressed their gratitude to Master Li. A Deputy Minister One weekend afternoon, I noticed a man holding a string of Buddha beads. I approached him and asked, “Brother, do you believe in Buddhism?” He responded by holding the beads up for me. We chatted, and he revealed that he was a retired deputy minister. Sensing my skepticism, he held up his cell phone and showed me photos of him dining with high-ranking officials. I asked him how he had attained such a position. “You should know that it’s easy to become an official if people have connections in the government. My father and my uncle both hold high positions in the government. Let me tell you, many high-ranking officials believe in God, and they all pray to God to protect their official positions and wealth.” Feeling curious, I inquired, “Do you believe in Falun Dafa? Have you ever read a book about Falun Dafa?” He replied he read a little bit about it and believes Falun Dafa is good. I helped him resign from the Party and said, “I finished handing out all of the Dafa truth-clarification materials I brought. Can we meet again so I can give you some?” He agreed and we made arrangements to meet the following Monday afternoon. He returned and waited for me as promised. I provided him with several pamphlets and a copy of Master’s new article, [How Humankind Came To Be](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2023/1/21/206699.html). He accepted them and carefully placed them in his bag. He was especially interested in Master’s latest article and started reading it. He remarked, “Master Li’s article is so precious; I will make more copies to share with my students and friends!” A Senior Police Officer I encountered a man who resembled a military officer sitting on a bench. I joined him and initiated a conversation, “I can see that you sit with a different posture, and you look like an upright person. You must be a senior military official!” He said he had retired from the Beijing Police Department. I advised him to quit the CCP, and he agreed and was very grateful. I then urged him to tell his family members to remember that, “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.” He promised he would. A Senior Teacher I noticed an elderly teacher sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper in a school garden. I approached him and commented, “Teacher, nowadays people are often glued to their cell phones. It's refreshing to see someone reading a newspaper. “Because you are a highly respected intellectual, I’d like to discuss a serious issue with you.” He inquired what was so serious. I replied, “It’s about the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance.” He remarked, “You must be a Falun Dafa practitioner.” I confirmed I am. He gave me a thumbs up and said, “You Falun Dafa practitioners are good people. Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good! “I have a lot to say about this but can’t find anyone to talk to about it. I will explore these issues today. It’s safe to talk to practitioners, as you won’t report me.” He delved into the various campaigns since the founding of the CCP, including the Three Anti-campaigns, the Five Anti-campaigns, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution. He asserted that all of these were disasters caused by the Communists and that the CCP had a systematic way of persecuting people. With curiosity, I asked him if all intellectuals viewed things the way he did. He responded, “People are different. Most people dare not discuss sensitive issues casually. We will be in trouble if we get reported, so we can only share these thoughts with you practitioners.” He also shared that he was aware of the staged [Tiananmen self-immolation incident](https://en.minghui.org/cc/88/). After helping him quit the CCP, I provided him with more information and a token [amulet]. In parting, he exclaimed, “I hope that you will persist. The victory will surely be yours!” Regimental Deputy Minister of Logistics One afternoon, as I was cleaning the house, I suddenly heard a voice say, “Go and clarify the truth.” Glancing at the time, I saw it was 2:30 p.m., my usual time to go out. I headed to the riverside and sat on a bench to rest. After a while, a tall and handsome man approached and sat down next to me. I looked at him and asked, “Are you a coach, brother?” He replied no. “You look like you’re a decent person, so I thought you were either a coach or an official.” He revealed he was an acting military official at the deputy regiment level. “I just retired from the military because I got into trouble. I’m very upright and couldn’t control myself when I saw people do bad things. I punched a wrongdoer and as a result, I was demoted two grades. I’ve been transferred back home.” He expressed regret for not being able to control his temper. I advised him, “It’s most important for you to stay safe.” I then disclosed that I’m a practitioner and encouraged him to recite, “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.” I told him that remembering these nine words would help him to improve his temper. He also accepted truth-clarification materials and agreed to quit the CCP. Master also arranged for many other high-ranking officials who still have kindness in their hearts to come to me to hear the truth about Dafa. Most of these officials said that Falun Dafa is good and agreed to withdraw from the CCP. I’m happy for them and hope they have a bright future. Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Samsung revoluciona el hogar con su visión de AI Home y nuevos electrodomésticos\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ha desvelado su visión renovada de “AI Home” durante el evento global Welcome to Bespoke AI en Seúl, Corea, mostrando un avance significativo en la integración de inteligencia artificial en electrodomésticos. La compañía presentó dispositivos más inteligentes y accesibles, que prometen transformar la vida cotidiana a través de una experiencia más segura, intuitiva y conectada.\nJeong Seung Moon, vicepresidente ejecutivo y director del Equipo de I+D de Digital Appliances en Samsung Electronics, presidió la conferencia de prensa global presentando la visión de la compañía para crear un hogar con inteligencia artificial que integre a la perfección múltiples dispositivos y, como resultado, satisfaga las necesidades de los usuarios en cada habitación.\n“Con nuestros electrodomésticos Bespoke AI, Samsung ha dado vida a un hogar inteligente impulsado por IA que no solo mejora la practicidad diaria, sino que también ofrece ahorro de energía y cuidados”, dijo Jeong Seung Moon. “Seguiremos ofreciendo AI Home avanzado a más hogares, con pantallas inteligentes, Bixby y seguridad Knox”.\nLínea de electrodomésticos Bespoke AI 2025\nDurante el evento, Samsung presentó su línea 2025 de electrodomésticos Bespoke AI, que ofrece características nuevas e innovadoras para resolver los difíciles problemas de los usuarios.\nEn el centro de la visión de la compañía se encuentra la pantalla AI Home. Tras la innovación de la primera presentación de la pantalla AI Home el año pasado, la AI Home con nuevas opciones de tamaño ha empezado a utilizarse en una amplia variedad de productos nuevos, como los refrigeradores Bespoke AI, la Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo, las lavadoras y las secadoras.\nLa pantalla AI Home de nueve pulgadas de la línea de refrigeradores Bespoke AI aumenta las opciones de los consumidores al ofrecerles una experiencia similar a la disponible en la pantalla más grande del AI Family Hub™. Con AI Vision Inside actualizada, es posible controlar mejor los alimentos con nuevas funciones, como el reconocimiento automático de alimentos procesados, tanto en los modelos con AI Family Hub™ como en los modelos con AI Home. Con la pantalla AI Home de 7 pulgadas en la Bespoke AI Laundry, los usuarios pueden controlar intuitivamente los ciclos de lavado y secado, así como monitorear y controlar otros dispositivos conectados.\nAdemás, los nuevos electrodomésticos Bespoke AI ofrecen funciones mejoradas que se adaptan a las necesidades de los consumidores. Por ejemplo, el refrigerador Bespoke AI Hybrid utiliza IA para enfriar eficientemente el interior del refrigerador detectando su estado actual y prediciendo cambios en la temperatura interna para adaptar el enfriamiento de manera eficaz.\nLa línea Bespoke AI Laundry incluye nuevas características que aumentan la comodidad del consumidor, con nuevos modelos autónomos que actualizaron AI Wash y AI Dry a AI Wash+ y AI Dry+, así como modelos que se lanzarán en Europa, que consumirán hasta 55% menos de energía que los requisitos mínimos para la certificación clase A de las lavadoras. Además, Samsung presentó el nuevo Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo, el primer combo ventilado de su clase. Reduce significativamente el tiempo de secado, finalizando el lavado y el secado en 68 minutos con su ciclo Super Speed.\nEn cuanto a su línea de aspiradoras, Samsung también sigue innovando. La aspiradora de mano inalámbrica Bespoke AI Jet Ultra se lanzará con la mayor potencia de succión del mundo, de hasta 400 W. El modo de limpieza AI 2.0 actualizado identifica los más diversos espacios, como esquinas y tipos de alfombras, para mejorar el rendimiento de limpieza.\nSamsung también presentó el Bespoke AI Jet Bot Steam Ultra. El robot aspirador no solo está diseñado para traspasar límites, sino que también cuenta con la función de reconocimiento de objetos mediante IA para entornos complejos, que puede reconocer obstáculos de hasta 1 cm e incluso líquidos transparentes para obtener los mejores resultados de limpieza. Y cuando se encuentra con esquinas o paredes, el cepillo sale, lo que le permite limpiar áreas que podrían ser difíciles para los robots aspiradores convencionales.\nFacilidad de uso, cuidado y ahorro a los consumidores\nSamsung expuso más sobre su visión de “AI Home” y su compromiso de integrar la IA en la experiencia conectada para adaptarse a diversos estilos de vida, a través de los principales beneficios de Facilidad de uso, Cuidado y Ahorro.\nGracias a la adopción de la pantalla AI Home, a los usuarios les resultará más fácil que nunca interactuar con la funcionalidad completa de sus electrodomésticos Bespoke AI. La pantalla inteligente ahora es un hub de control central aún mejor, que conecta incluso dispositivos de terceros a través de SmartThings sin necesidad de un dispositivo hub independiente. Los usuarios también pueden usar funciones como el Daily Board del refrigerador para recibir información personalizada y administrar mejor su día, o usar Map View para monitorear y controlar fácilmente otros dispositivos conectados.\nEl asistente Bixby actualizado permite un control más fácil de los dispositivos mediante comandos de voz y mejora la usabilidad con nuevas funciones, como Voice ID. Personaliza los servicios reconociendo la voz del usuario, cambiando automáticamente a la cuenta Samsung de quien habla y mostrando su calendario en la pantalla. Y si esa persona también usa la opción de baja visión en su teléfono inteligente Galaxy, se sincronizará automáticamente con su pantalla para una mejor experiencia de visualización.\nDurante el evento también se presentaron los nuevos servicios de SmartThings, entre ellos Family Care, que envía una alerta a otros miembros de la familia si el movimiento de un usuario no se detecta a la hora programada o si no hay actividad durante un determinado período de tiempo después de la última actividad. También es posible utilizar el robot aspirador para buscar señales de emergencia, y toda esta funcionalidad está protegida por Samsung Knox.\nEsfuerzos continuos para garantizar experiencias confiables\nPara completar su visión de “AI Home” para 2025, Samsung mostró cómo está superando los límites de la innovación, priorizando una experiencia confiable para los usuarios.\nEn primer lugar, Samsung aplicará la seguridad mejorada de Knox a los dispositivos de toda la línea para que los usuarios puedan disfrutar de la experiencia de AI en el hogar con tranquilidad. Específicamente este año, Trust Chain, que forma parte de Knox Matrix, se aplicará a todos los electrodomésticos con Wi-Fi lanzados en 2025. Los usuarios pueden monitorear el estado de seguridad de los productos en tiempo real a través del panel de control en cualquier momento.\nPor primera vez, Knox Vault también se aplica a los electrodomésticos, almacenando datos particularmente sensibles del usuario, como contraseñas e información de autenticación, en un chip de hardware separado para garantizar la protección. Además, para protegerse contra posibles ataques cuánticos futuros, la seguridad de Samsung también está equipada con criptografía poscuántica (PQC), que integra Knox Matrix Credential Sync, para sus productos de pantalla.\nOtra gran prioridad para Samsung es garantizar que los clientes puedan utilizar las últimas funciones de software en sus electrodomésticos actuales sin tener que comprar otros nuevos. Con Smart Forward, el servicio de actualización de software de SmartThings, Samsung mantiene sus electrodomésticos siempre actualizados con nuevas funciones para mejorar la experiencia del consumidor.\nSamsung también está siempre mejorando el mantenimiento de los productos. SmartThings Home Care utiliza IA para diagnosticar el estado de cada electrodoméstico y, si detecta signos de mal funcionamiento, envía una notificación con antelación. Además, un representante de soporte técnico puede brindar orientación sobre las acciones que se pueden tomar de forma remota en función de los resultados del diagnóstico previo. Esta función de soporte ahora se ha ampliado a más países, incluidos Francia, Países Bajos y Canadá, después de Corea y Estados Unidos.\nEtiquetas\nArtículos Relacionados",

    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) — As we near the end of 2023 people are getting ready for their New Year's Eve celebrations. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) partners with the Illinois State Police for their annual \"Drive sober or get pulled over\" campaign but what happens if you happen to be charged with a DUI? We break down the costs of a DUI. Driving sober during the holidays not only saves lives but it could also save you from having to pay thousands of dollars in court and attorney fees. When someone is charged with a DUI, the expenses begin before you make it to court. You could spend close to $1,000 on towing and storage fees. “If you get pulled over and you've got alcohol on your breath, I don't care what you do, you're going to get charged with DUI,\" said Springfield DUI attorney W. Scott Hanken. Hanken said first-time offenders can spend between $18,000 to $25,000 on a DUI charge. \"For a person that gets a DUI, you have to do whatever you can to avoid a conviction, because a conviction the costs that we're going to talk about skyrocket,\" Hanken said. Hanken said expenses increase drastically for repeat offenders but the biggest financial impact could be on your insurance premiums and employment status. \"The one thing that that doesn't factor in is your loss of income, loss of a job, and the impact that then has on your family. That is when it's devastating,\" he said. The Illinois Department of Transportation encourages motorists to drive sober, and if you plan to drink during the holidays it’s best to have a plan. \"A DUI can not only be expensive, it can be fatal. It can change your life, you could lose your life, and you can impact the lives in a negative way of others. Always designate a driver have a family member or friend drive you home make plans before you go out and celebrate and party,\" said IDOT spokesperson Paul Wappel. Officials say in Illinois, the first DUI conviction can result in a license suspension for six months, or a year if you refuse chemical testing. Some could also face up to a year in prison if found guilty of the misdemeanor. Both IDOT and Hanken agree that drunk driving is not worth the risk. Saying the costs of using a ride-sharing app or having a friend give you a ride are way less than having to pay for a DUI.",

In the meantime, Russia talks about the necessity to create a sovereign state of Palestine.

Our place has lengthy been well-known to each Tel Aviv and the Palestinians.\nLately, the Palestinian-Israeli battle has solely worsened by “middleman actions” of some nations. As Putin famous, at the moment in these nations there are politicians and consultants who consider that it’s essential to go on the trail of making an impartial state.\nAnd there are such folks in Israel.

Thus, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani referred to as on Putin to current an initiative for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.\nIn flip, the top of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, mentioned that Vladimir Putin’s phrases concerning the Palestinian drawback can not go away any Muslim detached. Our president overtly and boldly speaks the reality with out fearing the sidelong glances of the leaders of different nations.\nThe pinnacle of Chechnya famous that he helps Putin, who overtly says what “the world neighborhood is afraid to say”. On the identical time, Kadyrov proposed sending Chechen army personnel as peacekeepers.\nThe selection of nation\nThe Soviet Union de jure acknowledged Palestine in November 1988, nearly three years earlier than the restoration of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel. Russia, because the authorized successor of the USSR, has not really modified its thoughts – as is understood, there’s a Palestinian embassy in Moscow.\nThe pinnacle of the observer division of the Regnum information company, Mikhail Moshkin, in a dialog with a Tsargrad correspondent, famous that Russia stands for the suitable of the Arabs of Palestine to their very own statehood, promised to them by the UN resolutions of 1947, and to unravel the Palestinian difficulty purely a peaceable method – via negotiations with Israel, with out the intervention of “mediators” within the individual of the USA.\nThe identical opinion (a peaceable resolution with the prospect of “ two nations for 2 peoples’ ) can be shared by different non-Western nice powers, resembling China (as just lately recalled by Beijing’s particular envoy for the Center East) and India.\nIt’s one other matter that within the present battle the events usually are not Israel and the Palestinian Authority (which is understood to be led by Fatah chief Mahmoud Abbas from an workplace in Ramallah within the West Financial institution), however the ruling Hamas motion in Gaza, which doesn’t obey neither Abbas nor the internationally acknowledged Palestinian Authority,\n– explains Mikhail Moshkin.\nMoscow was involved with Hamas politicians, and in Russia, not like Israel, Hamas will not be thought-about both a terrorist or an extremist group. Russia is, if not allied, then no less than in mutually useful and pleasant relations with Iran, which has apparently sided with Hamas within the present conflict.\nAs consultants notice, the “subsidiary construction” of Tehran in Lebanon and Syria, the Shiite motion (and actually the quasi-state) Hezbollah, was and is our ally within the operation in Syria.

Towards the background of the duplicitous and inconsistent place of the Western nations, the statements of the top of state of Russia appear to be an instance of an goal angle and want for justice, in addition to compliance with worldwide regulation.\nOn the identical time, it’s tough to speak about such a class as management within the Muslim world.
