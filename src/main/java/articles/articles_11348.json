    "title": "女性绝经后还能进行夫妻生活吗？这 3 点要和伴侣一起看|同房|症状_网易订阅",
    "text": "林女士今年 51 岁，绝经后的生活像蒙了层灰。曾经恩爱的丈夫体贴依旧，可每当夜幕降临，她总找借口推托亲密时刻。干涩的疼痛、身体的僵硬，让她对夫妻生活从期待变成了恐惧，甚至刻意和丈夫保持距离。\n有次丈夫小心翼翼地提议一起旅行，她知道这是想修复关系，却还是忍不住发火：“都这把年纪了，折腾什么！” 话一出口就后悔，看着丈夫失落的神情，她躲进卫生间偷偷掉眼泪。更糟的是，她发现自己越来越容易焦虑，晚上翻来覆去睡不着，白天也提不起精神。\n直到偶然在社区讲座听到医生说：“绝经不是亲密生活的终点。” 她才意识到，自己一味逃避反而让问题更严重。现在的林芳开始慢慢尝试，她明白，只要用对方法，和丈夫重拾亲密时光并非遥不可及。\n绝经前身体的4大变化，伴侣必须懂\n女性通常45-55岁就会步入绝经期，身体会发出明显的\"信号\"，这些变化主要源于卵巢功能衰退和雌激素水平下降。了解这些变化，能帮助女性更好地应对这一特殊时期。\n1.月经不规律\n绝经前最明显的信号就是月经周期的改变。常见表现包括：从规律的一个月一次逐渐变为2-3个月甚至更久;多数人经量逐渐减少，但也有约20%的女性会出现经量突然增多;可能出现颜色变浅或出现黑色血块。但若出现异常大量出血，建议及时就医检查。\n2.情绪波动与认知变化\n雌激素的下降会直接影响神经系统，导致：易怒、烦躁、焦虑等情绪波动；记忆力减退、注意力不集中、入睡困难、易醒等失眠问题\n3.生理变化\n由于快绝经的女性体内的雌激素水平降低，会导致骨量丢失，所以这时候的女性容易出现关节痛、腰背酸痛，骨质疏松风险增加。由于激素水平变化，还会出现自主神经失调，会出现心慌、头晕、头痛、耳鸣等症状。\n此外，还会出现尿频、尿痛、反复尿路感染等问题。雌激素的分泌减少，还会导致阴道干涩、疼痛等问题。\n绝经后还能过夫妻生活吗？\n许多人认为绝经后就不能过夫妻生活了，虽然绝经后雌激素水平下降会导致阴道黏膜变薄、干涩，弹性变差，还可能出现同房疼痛，但这并不代表要与性生活绝缘。\n规律的夫妻生活能促进局部血液循环，有助于维持阴道弹性和湿润度，预防阴道萎缩；还能刺激激素分泌，调节情绪，缓解绝经后的焦虑和抑郁。\n同时夫妻生活过程中人体会分泌内啡肽、多巴胺等 “快乐激素”，这些物质能显著缓解焦虑、抑郁等负面情绪，改善绝经后因激素波动引发的失眠、烦躁等症状，提升整体幸福感。\n此外，夫妻间的亲密互动还是维系情感的重要纽带。通过身体与情感的深度交流，能增强彼此信任与依赖，提升婚姻满意度。\n因此，绝经并非性生活的终点，而是需要以更科学、包容的态度，享受亲密关系带来的身心滋养。\n绝经后夫妻生活 需注意这几点\n绝经后，女性因雌激素水平下降，生理结构发生变化，性生活需格外注意细节。\n首先，阴道黏膜变薄、分泌物减少易引发疼痛， 建议使用不含香料、防腐剂的医用润滑剂，缓解干涩问题 。特别注意的是，绝经后虽多数人不再排卵，但仍可能有意外排卵情况，建议 同房戴安全套 。安全套不仅可以避孕，还可防范疾病传播。\n其次，绝经后阴道自净能力减弱，细菌易滋生，性生活前后需用温水清洗外阴，避免使用刺激性清洁产品；伴侣也应保持私处卫生，降低感染风险。若出现白带异常、瘙痒等症状，及时就医。\n再者，若同房过程中出现疼痛、出血，或事后尿频、尿急，可能提示阴道撕裂或泌尿系统感染，切勿强忍，需尽快检查。同时，性生活频率应根据自身身体状况调整，避免过度疲劳。\n最后，绝经后的生理变化可能影响心理状态，夫妻间需坦诚交流感受，消除心理压力。将性生活视为亲密互动而非任务，更有助于享受其中乐趣。\n绝经只是人生的一个阶段，无需因生理变化放弃正常的性需求，在做好防护和沟通的前提下，依然能享受亲密时光。",

    "title": "Menorca, still a paradise in winter",
    "text": "Sections Highlight c Menorca Friday, 29 December 2023, 15:30 Compartir It seems that many holiday destinations can only be visited in summer. But it is exactly during this quieter season when they are at their best. Here in Menorca there are still some sunny mornings, long nights, dinners on the terrace and busy afternoons. This is what you can expect on the island, the easternmost territory of the country where the sun rises and sets first. As one of the quietest of the Balearic Islands, it is equally one of the islands that offers the most. Nature, unique beaches, first-class gastronomy... but there is so much more. There is also an archaeological and even artistic side to Menorca, a genuine island which you can enjoy away from the usual cold winter gloom. Contrary to its neighbouring islands, life on Menorca has a little more tranquillity to it. And a trip to the island is not complete without visiting its beaches. Its coastline, bathed in clear waters, is home to treasures in the form of beaches and hidden coves, with some that take you on stunning coastal paths that lead you to its secret treasures. It is worth the long trek however to reach and admire the beauty of Macarella, one of its most famous beaches, as well as the nearby Macarelleta, the impressive Turqueta or the hidden Cala Pregonda beach, found at the end of a nice walk along the Camí de Cavalls. Other beaches like the Cala Galdana or the Son Bou are equally beautiful and a little easier to access. Despite being a quiet island, activity on Menorca never stops. Three hotels have stood out recently as real paradises, and now is the perfect opportunity to get to know them. The NUMA group has released two luxury resorts which are everything you could wish for during some long-awaited days of holiday. The first is Amagatay, in Alaior, a hotel spanning 35 hectares, surrounded by olive trees. The property itself used to be an old agricultural estate more than 250 years ago, and was transformed into a luxury accommodation with only 20 rooms and suites, all of them unique and decorated with natural materials and colours. The second resort is Morvedra Nou, located in Camí de Macarella. With only 24 rooms, some of them with a private garden and pool and even a bathtub under the trees, it is very exclusive. Both locations cover a large natural area and feature pools where you can relax to the sound of cicadas. The other aspect which makes these places so special is the food. Both resorts had their menus expertly designed by talented chef Juanjo López, from La Tasquita de Enfrente. The chef brought his philosophy that less is more, and produced legendary dishes such as his Russian salad, one of the best you can eat in Spain. Both hotels also employ local products such as camot, la carn i xulla and la sobrasada, all types of deli meat, as well as typical local dishes such as lobster that is prepared in many different ways, either in stew, with egg and potato or as a salad. The third hotel is Son Vell, only 20 minutes from Ciutadella, and is the first hotel from the Vestige Collection on the island. Originally an 18th-century manor house, it now houses 34 rooms reminiscent of a Venetian style where antique furniture and pieces of art have been well-preserved. This luxury hotel also offers a movie night, yoga or Pilates sessions, as well as the option to play pétanque. In addition, there are two restaurants, Sa Clarisa which specialises in healthy haute cuisine, and Vermell, inspired by popular and traditional Menorcan recipes. While the variety of gastronomic offers is a key selling point for these hotels, it is equally a standout aspect of the island in general. Some examples of restaurants that are always popular in peak summer season are Sa Pedrera des Pujol, the legendary Café Balear or Sa Llagosta, a restaurant that specialises in one of the island's treasures, lobster. Along with them, there are some new restaurants to indulge in, such as Burdell de Foc, a restaurant project which united three of the biggest names in the food world, Javier Goya from Triciclo restaurant, José Fuente from Kulto restaurant and Fran Ramírez. A restaurant called Thai Garden also added its name to the pot by opening in El Lago Resort, and is one of the best spots to enjoy the flavours of Southeast Asia. Thai Garden joined a group of travelling restaurants, one of them being Godai, a Japanese restaurant led by chef Julián Mármol, and Kaypa, headed by chef Omar Malpartida. The most recent restaurant on this list is Pintarroja, a new seafood restaurant in Mahón, led by chef Eugeni de Diego. De Diego previously worked in the kitchens at the famous elBulli, and later launched his own restaurant concepts, such as the Tamae Bar or the Lombo Bar in Barcelona. Now he has arrived on the island with a restaurant to expand your gastronomic horizons. When you go there, you should order the mussels with sobrasada, the patatas fritas with egg and prawns and grilled seafood such as los canyuts, zamburiñas, lobster or sardines. And to drink, it has to be the traditional Menorcan pomada. Any of the lighthouses across the island pose as the perfect spot to soak in the sun setting along the horizon. To name a few, Cavallería, Punta Nati... and one of them even lets you enjoy the sunset with some dinner. This one is the Artrutx lighthouse, the second oldest on the island, located on the southwest coast. Its restaurant, the Artruxt Sea Club, is a place that gives off a beach bar vibe, a truly magical experience accompanied by the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to being nature's paradise with its infinitely beautiful beaches, Menorca is also a culturally rich holiday destination. This is the perfect opportunity to get to know the island's greatest treasure, consisting of a thousand-year legacy that brings together, in just 700 square kilometres, more than 1,500 prehistoric sites that date back from Bronze Age to the Romans in 123 BC. The Talayotic Menorca, a heritage site that has been converted into an open-air museum, is just one of the many historic sites around the island. It is such an important site that it is now part of the Unesco World Heritage List. To explore this precious artifact, you should visit villages such as Trepucó, Cornia Nou or el coll de Cala Morell, as well as areas like the necropolis of Calescoves or the Naveta des Tudons, one of the best preserved monuments on the island. Another of its major attractions is Hospital Island, which used to be an old hospital from the 18th century, but is now a centre of contemporary art. The highly anticipated project to revitalise this island began in 2021 with a new headquarters for the prestigious Hauser & Wirth art gallery. The journey there is frankly a delight as you depart from the Bay of Mahón to arrive at the island by boat and find a place that has integrated landscape and heritage. The gallery blends perfectly into its natural environment and has a garden dotted with sculptures by artists such as Chillida and Martin Creed, among others.

O meia, que teve uma passagem decepcionante pelo Tricolor na reta final de 2023, é a principal esperança do time uruguaio para superar o Rubro-Negro e garantir a classificação para a semifinal da competição. Leia mais: CEO do Al Nassr nega 'papel decisivo' de Cristiano Ronaldo em saída de Luís Castro Aos 25 anos, o jogador vem fazendo uma temporada de destaque pelos aurinegros. Ele marcou 16 vezes e deu 14 assistências em 34 jogos disputados. No torneio continental, são três bolas na rede e cinco passes para gol. Leo Fernández é considerado peça fundamental da equipe comandada por Diego Aguirre, sendo o \\\\\\\"motorzinho\\\\\\\" do time uruguaio. As bolas paradas, característica mais forte do jogador, inclusive, são um ponto a ser observado com atenção pelo Flamengo. Nesta temporada, são quatro gols em cobranças de falta. O seu desempenho em 2024 era o que o torcedor do Fluminense esperava, quando foi contratado em julho do ano passado. Porém, o meia não correspondeu às expectativas. Pelo Tricolor, disputou 20 jogos, fez um gol e deu uma assistência.
