    "title": "‘Ready to smash’ — As Ramadan draws near, Islam Makhachev sets hard deadline return",
    "text": "Islam Makhachev is hoping to [fight three times in 2024](https://www.mmamania.com/2023/11/23/23974270/islam-makhachev-calls-for-three-fights-in-2024). The reigning lightweight champion has only accomplished that feat once in his UFC career, logging three straight wins in 2021 over Drew Dober (UFC 259), Thiago Moises (UFC Vegas 31), and Dan Hooker (UFC 267). But as Ramadan draws near, the promotion may need to hustle if it hopes to honor his current request. “I’ll be ready to smash someone in March, or see you after Ramadan,” Makhachev wrote on social media. Much like his longtime friend and mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, the 32 year-old Makhachev does not compete during Ramadan, giving matchmakers very few options heading into the New Year. The only pay-per-view (PPV) card in March is UFC 299, [headlined by Sean O’Malley vs. Marlon Vera](https://www.mmamania.com/2023/12/19/24007847/latest-ufc-299-fight-card-ppv-lineup-omalley-vs-vera-2-on-march-9-miami-mma). UFC 299 wraps just a few days before Ramadan begins. “We need minimum 45 days to recover,” Nurmagomedov previously told [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/28954814/khabib-nurmagomedov-fight-ramadan-ufc-249-timing-crucial). “We compete at such a high level. That’s why we have to watch everything. It’s very hard and very dangerous, too. All day you don’t drink, don’t eat. Injuries can come. That’s why [you can’t have] too much contact. Even without sparring, it’s still hard.” In addition, Ramadan ends during [UFC 300 fight week](https://www.mmamania.com/2023/12/19/24007981/ufc-300-date-location-start-time-announced-conor-mcgregor-las-vegas-mma), which means we’re likely to see Makhachev delayed until some point next summer. That’s unless Dana White and Co. can manage to cobble together a 155-pound title defense within the next few weeks and find a spot for it on [the increasingly-busy schedule for first-quarter 2024](https://www.mmamania.com/pages/ufc-mma-schedule). “I’m planning to fight before Ramadan,” [Makhachev told reporters earlier this year](https://www.mmamania.com/2023/11/23/23974270/islam-makhachev-calls-for-three-fights-in-2024). “I already informed the UFC that I’m ready to fight before Ramadan, I would like to have time to do three fights in 2024. I will train as much as possible, constantly keep in shape, and wait for a call from the management.” There’s also [the UFC Saudi Arabia card on March 2](https://www.mmamania.com/2023/10/12/23914080/ufc-making-its-saudi-arabia-debut-for-riyadh-season-event-in-march). That event is expected to follow the traditional “Fight Night” format and stream on ESPN or [ESPN+](http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?subId2=%5B%5Dsb%5Bp%5D23771888%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dmmamania.com/pages%5Bd%5DD&sharedid=MMAMania), or perhaps both, so it would be unusual to have a champion with Makhachev’s clout competing on a non-PPV card. Then again, this marks the promotion’s debut in Riyadh, so perhaps UFC wants to put its best foot forward.

    "text": "[International](https://thehill.com/policy/international/) Israel balks after Hamas says it agrees to cease-fire deal Hamas says it has accepted an offer for a temporary cease-fire with Israel, as diplomatic negotiations intensify to free Israeli hostages held by Hamas and ward off an Israeli military operation on the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Hamas’s head of political and international relations, Basem Naim, confirmed to The Hill that Hamas had communicated with Egyptian and Qatari mediators that it had accepted a cease-fire proposal. The U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, has engaged intensively for weeks on a truce proposal between Israel and Hamas. Israel on Monday said it would send a delegation to engage in negotiations over efforts to secure a temporary cease-fire, but said “Hamas’s proposal is far from Israel’s necessary requirements,” according to a Hebrew-language statement from the prime minister’s office. At the same time, the Israeli wartime Cabinet on Monday decided unanimously to continue military operations against Hamas targets in Rafah. The Biden administration, which has sought to warn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against launching an attack on Rafah, expressed caution over Hamas’s cease-fire response. President Biden spoke Monday morning with Netanyahu, but White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said the call took place before Hamas issued its response. “We want to get these hostages out, we want to get a cease-fire for six weeks, we want to increase humanitarian assistance and the last thing I want to do is say anything at this podium that’s going to put that process at risk,” Kirby said at a press briefing Monday afternoon. The administration says a temporary cease-fire is the best way to secure the release of Israeli hostages, and protect more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah. The southern Gazan city sits on the border with Egypt and is a priority crossing point for humanitarian aid deliveries into the besieged territory. Israel has carried out an intensive seven-month war against Hamas in the strip following Hamas’s shocking Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which it killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. A weeklong temporary cease-fire in November secured the release of more than 100 hostages, an effort the administration has sought for months to try and replicate. Cease-fire mediators have not publicly detailed the full contents of the truce proposal. Naim did not answer questions from The Hill about the proposal’s details. But the broad contours of the deal is a six-to-eight week pause in fighting, in which Hamas would release Israeli hostages it has held since it kidnapped them from Israel on Oct. 7. The release of the hostages would occur in phases, with the most vulnerable of the 133 believed to be in Gaza released first. In exchange, Israel is expected to release an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, withdraw its troops from certain regions of the Gaza Strip, and allow for Palestinians in Gaza to travel from the south of the territory to the north. The pause in fighting is also expected to allow for a surge of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, where more than 1 million Palestinians have been displaced by fighting, tens of thousands have been wounded amid the war, and starvation and disease are rampant.

    "text": "I feel lucky to have the job I do. Every day, I help folks stay up to date on tech and help solve all those digital-life problems Google just can’t answer.\nAnd after all these years, I’ll toot my own horn a little and say there’s not much that stumps me anymore. I did get a question recently, though, on my daily podcast that had a not-so-happy answer.\nBob in Detroit asked how he can delete himself from the internet. Oh, Bob. You’re not the only one who has asked, and my answer is always the same: You can’t. There’s just too much out there about most of us.\nBut all is not lost!\nOne thing you can do is take back some of your online privacy. I’m sure you’ve heard me talk about people search and data broker sites before. They’re the online directories and marketplaces where all your data is packed up and sold off. The level of detail they get down to would shock you.\nI’ve spent hours … and hours deleting my own info from these sites so I could show you how, too. The trouble is, the steps are usually pretty tricky to follow, they change all the time and, before you know it, they found another bit of data and added you right back. The cycle continues.\nThat’s why I want to\ntell you about Incogni. Before I could recommend it to you, I tried it out myself. The process took me a few minutes, and I was immediately opted out of 27 databases, with 47 more requests sent. Now I’m up to 151 sites — poof, my data is gone.\nAll you have to do is create an account and then enter your name and address. These sites require this info to remove your data — so you’d do that whether or not you use Incogni. Then, you grant Incogni permission to reach out on your behalf. After you finish the setup process, you’ll see a\nlist of sites you’ve been removed from and pending requests.\nIt’s never been this easy to get your privacy back. I’m glad I let Incogni take care of it for me — and I negotiated a special deal for you to try it out, too.\nRight now, get 60% off an annual subscription using code KIM60.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
