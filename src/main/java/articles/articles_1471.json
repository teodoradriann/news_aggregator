    "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update breaks assault rifles so badly, they're pretty much useless now \"It's the usual s*** with modern live-service CoDs. Patches breaking stuff in unexpected ways. Nice.\" No, it's not just you - it looks like the latest [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024) update has nerfed assault rifles. As spotted by our friends at Digital Foundry, \"assault rifles effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges\". That's not all, either. It seems the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse - cannot be equipped at all anymore (although it can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped). The issue with assault rifles is that the damage you mete out is extremely low as the effective range has seemingly dropped from 40+m to 5.7m and 10.9m - which means you're essentially tickling enemy players to death. FYI Black Ops 6 players, S1 Battle Pass has two major bugs! 1️⃣ Assault rifle effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges. 2️⃣ The Ghost perk can't be equipped, but can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped. Spread the word! — Will Judd 威廉 ([[image or embed]][@wsjudd.bsky.social])[November 14, 2024 at 8:03 PM] \"So it seems they botched the damage ranges for a lot of Assault Rifles with this update,\" opined Camocheese on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gr8s2g/a_lot_of_ars_are_broken_right_now/). \"I was wondering why the AK felt so weak, so I looked at the advanced stats, and it says like damage beyond effective range 5.7 meters so it's now dealing its MINIMUM damage past barrel stuffing ranges. The AMES, Model L and Goblin also seem to be broken. Good stuff. \"Also the patch broke Ghost for me. I'm level 21, but Ghost is still locked despite unlocking at level 17. \"It's the usual shit with modern live-service CoDs,\" they finished. \"Patches breaking stuff in unexpected ways. Nice.\" [A lot of ARs are broken right now] by[u/Camocheese]in[blackops6] Although Treyarch has [noted](https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1857111993121177998) and is \"investigating\" an issue where \"Ghost remains locked despite meeting requirements to unlock it\", it has not yet formerly acknowledged the problem with assault rifles. Yesterday, we reported [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is clamping down on what it calls \"disruptive behaviour\"](https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-patch-notes-detail-changes-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour) - specifically, players going AFK to boost account levels without playing, or playing on alternative servers via VPNs. \"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk,\" Chris Tapsell wrote in [Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review](https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review).",

    "text": "Heavy downpours batter the UK as temperatures soar to 30C Greater London was hit by the heaviest downpours of the day. Heavy downpours have battered the UK as almost a month’s worth of rain fell in an hour in Greater London, the Met Office said. A yellow warning for thunderstorms was issued by the forecaster that covered the majority of the UK on Thursday as temperatures soared to highs of 30C. Drivers faced road closures and there were disruptions to public transport, power cuts and flooding. By 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data. Average total rainfall for the month of August in the same area is 56mm, the forecaster said. Just under 40 miles away, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water in Guildford, Surrey. Benson Lock in Oxfordshire recorded 30mm of rainfall in an hour while Wisley, Surrey, enjoyed the highest temperature of the day of 30.2C. By Thursday evening, 26 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, had been issued by the Environment Agency – 11 of which were in Greater London. One flood warning, meaning flooding is expected, was issued for Kidbrooke Stream at Forest Row in East Sussex. Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said: “There’s been very humid air which is why it’s felt so close and muggy as well. “The same air has been over northern France for the last day or two as well – so those heavy thundery showers that they had during the triathlon yesterday morning. “So basically, we’ve been getting the same sort of weather as the Olympics have.” Friday will be “mostly dry” with highs of up to 29C in south-east England, he added. “It will be another very warm, very muggy feeling day and that’s what helps keep a few of those showers going – but it’s not until Saturday where things will feel much fresher across the board.”",

    "text": "\nAttacks on Freedom of Religion\nAt the turn of the last century, Jewish immigrants who sought to observe the Sabbath Day faced a work culture in the United States that required employees to work on Saturdays. A person could be employed Sunday through Friday, not come to work on Shabbos, and be summarily fired.\nThis culture led to a lot of stories that we celebrate of people who put their principles first. When Jews lose the Shabbos, we lose ourselves. But it also surely led to a great deal of assimilation, as families decided that putting food on the table was more important than a remnant custom from the Old Country.\nOf course, these were stories we heard as children. And even then, they seemed hard to believe. What kind of employer would let an employee go, if that employee worked hard and well? After all, pay was only in return for hours worked, so a policy that fired Sabbath-observing Jews seemed to defy logic – and we like logic. Maybe the stories were really exaggerated…?\nNot so much.\n[New NY bill would require restaurants in transit centers to be open on Sundays]New York and New Jersey might require restaurants along the New York State Thruway [and Port Authority] to stay open to travelers seven days of the week.This bill is aimed squarely at a Christian company, Chick-fil-A, as a direct attack on religious freedom.I know well that there is no shortage of similar outrages (abortion, cake-baking, etc.). But this one really sticks in my craw as overt and institutionalized evil. If you believe that G-d commanded you to not work on the Sabbath Day, but a government tries to coerce you to act against G-d’s word…. what scumbags.Published in [General]This post was promoted to the Main Feed by a Ricochet Editor at the [recommendation of Ricochet members].

    "text": "AIMCo Chair and former CPPIB CEO Mark Wiseman said that Canada needs to make sure that immigrants are contributing to not only GDP growth, but also to GDP per capita growth. In sharing his economic outlook for 2024 with Bloomberg, Wiseman said that “I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet, particularly in this country.” “There continues to be strong growth in the US, apparently with lower inflation, at least for the time being. So that’s a good signal. “Canada – we’re behind. “The productivity gap continues in this country, doesn’t seem to be abating, and I think slower Canadian growth relative to our brother in the South is going to be a continuing problem for the Canadian economy.” According to him, Canadian productivity – which is reflected in GDP per capita, income, and Canadians’ wealth – is 27 percent lower than that in the US.

According to Wiseman, Canada needs two things – it needs to “double down” on its comparative advantages, and it needs a higher degree of competition, both within Canada and with the rest of the world. Immigration is one of Canada’s greatest comparative advantages in the form of human capital. However, that human capital needs to become more productive. This, he posits, can be achieved through a few means. Firstly, people need to be educated for the “jobs of the future.” This spans jobs in a variety of sectors, with a special focus on tech – especially artificial intelligence. Secondly, people need to be allowed to freely work across provinces, with little to no barriers to employment or barriers to trade across the country. Thirdly, it needs to be ensured that Canadian companies are spending on both physical and human capital in continuous improvement. The immigrants coming to Canada, he added, are positively adding to the economy, and it needs to be ensured that they are contributing positively to not only GDP, but also GDP per capita, which is defined as a country’s total gross domestic output divided by its total population. Immigrants do jobs that many Canadians do not want to do, and it needs to be ensured that they are productive, said Wiseman. It needs to be ensured that students to Canada are actually studying and intend to stay productively. Watch Video The statistics are positive, but it should not be the case that immigrants are solely used as cheap labor to replace capital productivity improvements in Canada. If this is not achieved, Canada is going to become relatively poorer in comparison to other countries, especially the United States. “We have to fight against complacency. We have to benchmark ourselves to a higher standard. And I think that there is no higher standard, and no better standard, than the United States,” concluded Wiseman. “And so, we need to be asking ourselves, ‘are our businesses as competitive as similar businesses in the US?’ Are our workers as productive as similar workers in the United States? Are our companies spending on research and development and innovation at the same level as their American counterparts?’ And if the answer to those questions is no, what’s going to happen is that at a relative scale, Canadians are going to become poorer and poorer next to their cousins in the United States.”",
