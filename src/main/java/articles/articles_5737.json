    "title": "Firm expands lawsuit against Walmart after janitor is accused of filming women in store bathroom",
    "text": "ATLANTA ( WANF /Gray News) - A law firm in Atlanta has expanded its previous lawsuit against Walmart, demanding $750 million and alleging the stores provide a “fertile crime scene for sex offenders.” Five women filed a lawsuit in November against the company and against Lester Jolly, who worked as a janitor at a Walmart in Decatur, Georgia. They accused Jolly of filming them in the bathroom at the store and said Walmart was negligent by not preventing the incidents. Jolly was arrested in June and charged with two counts of unlawful eavesdropping or surveillance. The law firm Jonathan W. Johnson LLC said Jolly potentially targeted more than 100 women and children and sent the videos to third parties. The suit also said Jolly is part of a wider pattern, citing 48 accounts of Walmart customers or employees who were sexually violated in bathrooms. “This case is about a nationwide systemic practice of reckless behavior and intentional concealment of crimes by Walmart for crimes occurring in its bathrooms,” the amended complaint, filed on Tuesday, states in part. “Most of the victims are unaware that intimate videos of them taken in the toilet have been recorded and disseminated.” The lawsuit claims the company allowed Jolly to continue filming after learning of the incidents and didn’t notify victims about what had happened. One of the plaintiffs, another Walmart employee, also said management told her not to talk about what Jolly did. When she warned other women, she was fired in retaliation, the lawsuit said. While speaking to an attorney with Jonathan W. Johnson LLC, Jolly admitted to filming five or six women, according to a phone call transcript attached to the amended lawsuit. He said he was being blackmailed to film the videos and that the unknown party had hacked his phone. He denied having filmed children in the bathroom. The lawsuit names several causes for the legal action. Those include different types of negligence and invasions of privacy, infliction of emotional distress, premises liability and child endangerment. It also says the Walmart in Decatur is a “hotbed of criminal activity.” A blotter shows the DeKalb County police have been called to the store more than 1,000 times since 2019 for everything from shoplifting to sexual battery. “This history demonstrates that Walmart is indifferent to the safety of both its customers and (its) employees, in violation of its legal duties to them and in violations of common decency and ethics,” the lawsuit said. In a statement, Walmart said it is reviewing the amended complaint. “The safety and security of everyone in our stores, and respect for the individual is always a top priority,” the company said.

    "text": "Around 33,000 workers of Boeing affiliated with the District 751 and W24 of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers voted Thursday afternoon (Pacific Time) on the new labor contract proposed by the company, as well as on a call to strike.\nApproximately 95% of voters rejected the contract, and 96% approved the strike (set to begin at midnight on September 13), expected results considering that the tentative agreement announced on Sunday included only a 25% wage increase over a four-year period, while workers had requested 40%.\nTo counter this gap, Boeing played a key card: committing that the new commercial aircraft they would develop would be manufactured in the Seattle and Portland areas, thus guaranteeing job stability in that region. But there was a “catch”: this was only valid if the program was announced before 2028.\nThe American manufacturer also promised improvements in health and retirement plans, a $3,000 bonus, a reduction in mandatory overtime, and the promotion of 4,000 employees.\nBut none of this was enough, and now, on top of all the problems that Boeing has been carrying, it now faces the first strike of this magnitude since 2008, when it lasted for 57 days. Various financial analysts from entities such as UBS and TD Cowen estimated that if the strike extends similarly, Boeing could face losses between 3 and 4 billion dollars.\nThe impact would also reach airlines, which will have to deal with further delays in the delivery of new aircraft.",

    "title": "Saudi employs highest number of Sri Lankan workers in 2023 - Sunday Observer",
    "text": "Saudi Arabia has ranked first in providing work opportunities to Sri Lankan expatriates in 2023, as over 63,000 of them found employment in the Kingdom. Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, P.M. Amza said that in 2023 expatriate remittances amounted to over US$ 7 billion, of which a significant portion, 15 to 20 percent was contributed by expatriate workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). “KSA has become the number one country during 2023, generating 63,000 employment opportunities for Sri Lankans,” he told the Arab News yesterday. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are a preferred choice for Sri Lankan workers, with KSA being their key destination, lately also attracting skilled professionals to its megaprojects such as NEOM under Vision 2030. These projects, in addition to a new employment scheme under the Skills Verification Program (SVP), were the main factors making the KSA increasingly attractive to Sri Lankans, according to Amza. The SVP agreement signed in March aims to improve the professional competence of employees in the Saudi labour market and ease the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation. Under the deal – which covers 23 professions – Saudi employers recognise accreditations issued by Sri Lanka’s Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC). “The year 2023 has seen the qualitative and quantitative increase of employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in the KSA,” Amza said, adding that while half of Sri Lankan expatriates have been employed in the domestic sector, this year showed growth in the number of those working in the construction and hospitality sectors. “The signing of the agreement on the SVP between the two countries has also contributed to this increase of skilled and professional categories of employment, which stood at nearly 12,000 during 2023.”",

    "text": "Expulsão de diplomatas, encerramento de consulados e aumento das tensões — as relações entre a Rússia e a Polónia parecem estar a enfraquecer depois de alegadas tentativas de “sabotagem russa” em território polaco, que levaram a ameaças de deportação e corte de relações diplomáticas.\nNa passada terça-feira, o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Polónia anunciou o encerramento do consulado russo em Poznań por suspeitas de sabotagem. Radosław Sikorski, o ministro com a pasta diplomática, adiantou que houve “operações, ciberataques e uma desestabilização da fronteira com a Bielorrúsia”, tudo pelas mãos de Moscovo.\nO papel da Polónia enquanto centro de transporte de provisões militares para a Ucrânia terá sido o que tornou o país num alvo de espionagem russa, de acordo com a Reuters . Mais concretamente, avança a agência de notícias britânica, a decisão que levou ao fecho do consulado foi o caso de um cidadão ucraniano, que foi acusado de planear incendiar uma fábrica de tinta na cidade de Wrocław. “O tribunal encontrou provas fortes de tentativas de sabotagem e que quem estava ao comando eram os serviços secretos russos”, afirmou Sikorski.\nCom isto, foi tomada a decisão de deportar dez funcionários de volta para a Rússia, segundo a agência de notícias estatal russa TASS . Entre eles estão três diplomatas, cinco funcionários administrativos e ainda dois à espera de acreditações. O gabinete de imprensa do Ministério polaco dos Negócios Estrangeiros deixou bem claro: “Em caso de reincidência destes acontecimentos, a Polónia tem o direito de tomar medidas decisivas”. Sikorski adiantou, “se expulsarmos o embaixador, então eles vão fazer a mesma coisa”, mas é uma ideia que o chefe da diplomacia polaca não descarta, caso a sabotagem russa continue.\nMaria Zakharova, a porta-voz do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia, questionada sobre a decisão polaca pela agência TASS , deu uma resposta extremamente breve, mas muito clara: “Diplomatas polacos, preparem-se”.\nTexto editado por Dulce Neto\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR",

The school’s Indiana Business Research Center reported that Indiana added nearly 30,000 residents last year. Nearly 6.9 million people now live in the state. Read more: Indiana metro areas driving state population growth According to the researchers, more than 20,000 people moved to Indiana in 2023. There were also 7,500 more births than deaths, they said. “Indiana’s growth was fueled by another year of exceptionally high net in-migration,” the center’s senior demographer, Matt Kinghorn, said Thursday. “The state had a net inflow of nearly 22,500 residents last year, which is the third consecutive year this measure topped the 20,000-residents mark. For context, we estimate the state had an average net in-migration of 9,100 people per year last decade.” The researchers also said 23 rural counties experienced combined overall growth in 2023 for the third year in a row. Those populations were declining pre-pandemic. Indiana’s six-fastest growing counties were all in the Indianapolis metro area. The Bloomington metro area was among three that lost population in 2023.",

    "text": "Isère Le jour du brevet, nouvelle grève des enseignants au collège Les Dauphins\nAlors que les épreuves écrites du brevet communes ont lieu ces jeudi 26 et vendredi 27 juin, un nouveau mouvement de grève est en cours, ce jeudi, au collège Les Dauphins à Saint-Jean-de-Soudain. Une première journée de grève avait eu lieu, jeudi 19 juin , accompagnée par une action de parents d’élèves, pour alerter sur un « établissement en souffrance ». Suite à cette première mobilisation, “le rectorat n’a pas donné réponse aux enseignants”, selon un communiqué des professeurs grévistes.\n“Forcés par ce silence, deux tiers des professeurs (21 sur 33) se sont à nouveau mobilisés le jeudi 26 juin, jour de l’examen national du brevet, en dépit de leurs valeurs et de leur engagement auprès des élèves. À défaut de réponse claire, le mouvement sera reconduit le vendredi 27 juin”.\nLes enseignants mobilisés dénoncent “une situation délétère depuis deux ans et demi et un management nocif.”, ainsi que la convocation de six professeurs du collège par le rectorat. Contacté, ce dernier n’a pas encore répondu à nos sollicitations. Selon nos informations, des mesures pourraient avoir été prises pour que les épreuves puissent se dérouler au mieux.",

    "text": "Empresa foi condenada a pagar R$ 1,5 mil a funcionária por negligência atualizado Compartilhar notícia Por falta de ar-condicionado no local de trabalho , a Justiça do Trabalho condenou uma empresa de segurança e serviços de Unaí, no Norte de Minas Gerais, a pagar indenização por dano moral no valor de R$ 1,5 mil a uma trabalhadora. Ficou comprovado que a empregadora foi negligente quanto ao cumprimento das regras de conforto térmico e acústico, segundo decisão do Tribunal Regional do Trabalho de Minas Gerais (TRTMG). O pedido da trabalhadora se baseou na alegação de que teria se submetido a altas temperaturas no escritório em que trabalhava, sem que houvesse qualquer tipo de ventilação ou climatização. A cidade de Unaí registra temperaturas que ultrapassam 40ºC em determinadas épocas do ano. Já a empregadora sustentou que sempre cumpriu o ordenamento jurídico legal, proporcionando um ambiente de trabalho saudável aos empregados. Afirmou ainda que a autora não trabalhava toda a sua jornada sem ar-condicionado ou era submetida a calor excessivo. Para ler a reportagem completa acesse Tribuna de Minas , parceiro do Metrópoles.",
