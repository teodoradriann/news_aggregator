    "title": "Bloc leader says he is shocked by millions in 'juicy' bonuses awarded to CBC execs",
    "text": "OTTAWA — The $18.4 million CBC/Radio-Canada awarded in bonuses to its employees this year is shocking, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said. He also said bonuses at the public broadcaster aren't justified because a government-owned corporation doesn't face competition like in the private sector. \"The juicy bonuses given under the pretext that without them we aren't competitive in the market — well, we've been hearing that for decades .... Negotiate yourself a salary,\" Blanchet told reporters in the lobby of the House of Commons. Describing bonuses as icing on a cake, Blanchet suggested the corporation was using them as a \"kind of backdoor salary\" that hides how much people are really being paid because the bonuses are only revealed in the media \"once a year.\" \"There can be a little bit of icing, but when the icing becomes part of the salary, I usually start to question things,\" Blanchet said, adding that the millions of dollars in bonuses \"shocks\" him. The Canadian Press reported this week that the public broadcaster paid $18.4 million in bonuses to 1,194 employees this year after it eliminated hundreds of jobs. That included $3.3 million paid to 45 executives, which comes out to an average bonus of more than $73,000. More than $10.4 million was paid out to 631 managers, and over $4.6 million was paid to 518 other employees. This year's amount is an increase from the $14.9 million paid out to 1,143 employees in the 2022-23 fiscal year. Opposition Conservatives want the head of the public broadcaster, Catherine Tait, to return to the parliamentary hot seat and provide answers. Earlier this year, members of the House heritage committee unanimously concluded in a report presented to the House of Commons that, given the budget cuts, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to award bonuses to its executives. It is not clear whether Tait was among those who received performance pay this year. The CEO's performance pay is determined based on a recommendation from the CBC/Radio-Canada board of directors, with approval from the federal government. The CBC and the federal government have both refused to answer questions, citing privacy rules. Between December 2023 and March 31, CBC/Radio-Canada laid off 141 employees and cut 205 vacant positions. NDP heritage critic Niki Ashton said, \"it is time to prohibit the CBC from giving bonuses to executives, and for it to use that money to save local journalism.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.

    "text": "In a heartfelt initiative to honor mothers and promote environmental sustainability, the \"A Tree in the Name of Mother\" campaign was launched today at the BJP office in Chandankiyari. The event was led by Leader of Opposition, Amar Kunar Bauri, and saw enthusiastic participation from local officials, party members, and residents. The campaign aims to plant trees in the name of mothers and ensure their care until they mature. This not only serves as a tribute to the nurturing role of mothers but also contributes to environmental conservation. During the meeting, participants committed to planting a tree and taking personal responsibility for its growth and care. This initiative underscores the importance of individual responsibility in environmental sustainability. Amar Bauri emphasized the need for community involvement. \"Planting a tree in the name of your mother is a beautiful way to honor her and give back to nature. Let’s make this a community effort and ensure each tree thrives,\" he said. His words resonated with many, encouraging a unified effort towards a greener future. Individuals are encouraged to participate by planting a tree in their mother's name. Once planted, they are to take responsibility for the tree’s care until it grows into a healthy plant. Participants are also asked to share photos of their tree-planting efforts on social media with the hashtags #Plant4Mother and #One_Tree_Mothers_Name. This will inspire others to join the campaign and spread awareness.",

    "text": "The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for snow covering much of the North East and North Yorkshire for this weekend.It is in force from 9pm on Saturday night, until 11.59pm on Sunday night, and affects mainly inland areas of the region, including much of Northumberland, County Durham and North Yorkshire.Amber warnings mean there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property.Meanwhile, a less severe yellow weather warning for snow and ice covers Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, and more coastal areas. Forecasters say snow will begin in the south on Saturday, then spread north across the rest of the area through Sunday morning. It will be persistent and heavy at times, and will likely drift in brisk easterly winds, especially over higher ground. Much of the warning area can expect 3-7cm of snow. Areas above 150m will likely see 15-30cm, with 40cm for ground above 300m, before snow begins to ease and clear by the end of Sunday. The Met Office says travel during Saturday night and Sunday is likely to be difficult, with their advice being to avoid driving in snowy and icy conditions if possible.They advise those who do need to drive to accelerate gently, use low revs and change to higher gears as quickly as possible, keep a distance from other vehicles, and avoid slamming on brakes.The cold weather also brings with it the possibility of power cuts, with experts suggesting people could prepare by gathering torches and batteries, mobile phone power packs and other essential items.

    "text": "Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide better known by its trade name, Roundup. Residues of this compound are found in many foods. (Keep reading for a somewhat shocking, if partial, list.) To date, many lawsuits have claimed that glyphosate was responsible for cancer. Settlements have reached billions of dollars. Cancer may not be the only worry when it comes to glyphosate, though.\nRoundup and Neuroinflammation:\nNew research in mice suggests that glyphosate may also cause inflammation in the brain ([Journal of Neuroinflammation, Dec. 4, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39633366/)). To learn about this, the investigators dosed the mice with glyphosate for two weeks and examined their brain tissue after six months. (That’s a significant proportion of a mouse’s life expectancy.)\nDespite the extended recovery period, there was clear evidence of neurological impairment and inflammation within the brain. The authors conclude that glyphosate exposure in these mice resulted in brain pathology similar to that seen in Alzheimer disease.\nThey warn:\n“As glyphosate use continues to rise, more research is needed to elucidate the impact of this herbicide and its metabolites on the human brain, and their potential to contribute to dysfunctions observed in neurodegenerative diseases.”\nEWG Warns of Glyphosate Exposure in Common Foods:\nA report several years ago by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) suggested that oats and oat cereals contain residues of glyphosate. Some industry-affiliated groups contested those findings, leaving doctors and patients wondering what to think.\nWhat’s Wrong with Roundup?\nThis report got a lot of attention at the time. In part, that was because the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared glyphosate a [probable human carcinogen](https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/herbicide-is-named-probable-carcinogen/) back in 2015. Needless to say, the company that makes Roundup did not agree. A Monsanto spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the popular weedkiller had been extensively studied and that it does not cause cancer.\nNonetheless, a California jury awarded $289 million in damages to the heirs of a man who claimed that his exposure to Roundup as a groundskeeper for a school system led to his terminal cancer.\nWhich Breakfast Cereals Contain Roundup?\nWhile the EPA and its European counterpart deliberated on whether glyphosate actually poses an elevated risk of cancer, the [EWG warned that breakfast foods like oats, granola, oatmeal and granola bars](https://www.ewg.org/childrenshealth/glyphosateincereal/#.W40nOS2ZO3A) may contain elevated levels of the herbicide. EWG named Quaker Oats Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats as well as Cheerios as contaminated with Roundup residue. Quaker Oats and General Mills both objected that their products met safety standards. Until policymakers resolve the controversy over glyphosate as a cancer-causing agent, parents may want to find substitutes for these popular breakfast foods. EWG suggested relying on organic oat products rather than potentially contaminated ones.\nAre There Other Foods with Roundup Residue?\nOats are not the only foods that have been found to contain residues of this herbicide. When scientists tested soy, corn, chickpeas, grapes and honey in Europe and North America, they detected contamination ([Foods, Nov. 12, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8622992/)).\nThese investigators reached the cautious conclusion:\n“Glyphosate residues have been detected in a large number of samples, sometimes in values that exceed the legally permitted limits, which can put at risk the most vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly.”",

The contents in the container were falsely declared as other items. The Illegal Fireworks Task Force says the shipment contained illegal aerials and an assortment of other illegal fireworks. They were also packaged in amounts that exceeded what any single package may contain under state law. Officials suspect the fireworks were likely headed to the black market for sale. “The Illegal Fireworks Task Force is committed to interdicting fireworks wherever and whenever we can locate them. We are currently investigating these illegal shipments and believe that additional seizures of illegal fireworks may be imminent,” said Hawaiʻi Department of Law Enforcement Director Jordan Lowe. The investigation into this shipment and a previous shipment of illegal fireworks [seized a week prior](https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/local-news/2023-12-21/tons-of-illegal-fireworks-seized-in-a-bust-before-new-years-eve) is still ongoing.

Sport 1 week ago Nandre Burger returned to pick up two wickets off consecutive deliveries, and from 52/2 in the 19th over, India were shot out for 131 in the 35th, a collapse of 79/8 in 16 overs.\nOnly Kohli showed the necessary skill to get on top of the SA bowlers, making 76 off 82 balls, but his composure was also absent at times, as shown in his role in the crazy run out of Jasprit Bumrah.\nThere will be plenty of questions for the Indians to answer.\nThis series, diabolically only lasting two matches, is one they now cannot win.\nSA remains the only country in which India has yet to win a Test series.\nFor South Africa this win will provide a much needed boost in morale.\nFor Dean Elgar it was a personal triumph.\n‘It was just my day’: Rabada on his five-star Boxing Day Test day one display Proteas front-line fast bowler Kagiso ‘KG’ Rabada was almost lost for words when asked to describe his masterful, clinical and almost flawless ... Sport 1 week ago Having announced his retirement from Test cricket - a decision partly down to the lack of Test match play for the Proteas in the next few years - he produced one of his best performances in making 185 and anchored the SA first innings in which they scored 408 on a difficult pitch, with overhead conditions also favouring the bowlers.\nHe ended up as captain too with Temba Bavuma not able to take the field because of a hamstring strain he picked up while fielding on the first day.\nThe team’s management, following numerous inquiries over the last few days, finally provided an update on Thursday afternoon, that stated Bavuma was still undergoing “continuous medical assessments.”\nAlthough there’d been speculation about him possibly batting, that was deemed too risky.\nFortunately India’s fragility and the brilliance of SA’s bowlers meant a fourth innings run chase was eliminated.\nRabada finished with 2/32, while debutant Nandre Burger claimed 4/33 and Jansen, despite some struggles with control, took 3/36.\nThere will be concerns about the fielding, with South Africa dropping five catches in the matches, three in India’s second innings.\nBut that is a problem that can be addressed from a position of triumph.",
