    "title": "How Much Do Miebo Eye Drops Cost?",
    "text": "Miebo eye drops represent a breakthrough for treating dry eye disease. However, their steep price can limit access for many patients. This guide examines Miebo costs, factors affecting pricing, available savings programs, and tips for affording this vision-saving medication.\nHow Much Do Miebo Eye Drops Cost? The average cost of Miebo eye drops falls around $850 per monthly supply or $10,000 yearly , with resources to help reduce the financial burden for many patients.\nThe typical out-of-pocket cash price for a standard 3 mL bottle of Miebo eye drops purchased at a retail pharmacy falls in the range of:\n$700 – $750 at discount retailers like Walmart and Costco $800 – $900 at drugstore chains like CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid $900+ from some independent and regional pharmacies Many factors influence exact pricing:\nGeographic region and individual pharmacy policies significantly sway pricing. Comparing across multiple pharmacies may reveal cost differences of $150 or more. Coupons and discount programs like GoodRx can reduce retail cash prices around 15-20%. Insurance coverage brings down out-of-pocket costs through contracted rates and copays, but still often leaves patients paying hundreds per bottle. On average across retailers, most patients pay around $850 for a one-month supply of Miebo , equating to an annual expense of $10,000 per year based on standard dosing.\nAccording to Canadian Prescription Drugstore , a 3ml bottle of Miebo is priced at approximately $136.00 . This product is marketed as equivalent to Novatears eye drops and is produced by AFT Pharmaceuticals.\nAnother source, SingleCare , reports that the average retail price for Miebo is around $1,253.99 for a 3ml bottle. However, with discounts offered through their service, patients can potentially pay as little as $755.28 for the same quantity, highlighting the importance of using savings programs.\nA report from Drugs.com indicates that Miebo can be quite expensive, with prices listed at about $272.52 per unit , which translates to a total cost of around $1,362.61 . This pricing reflects the high cost associated with prescription medications for dry eye treatment.\nAccording to information from Miebo’s official website , eligible commercially insured patients may pay as little as a $0 copay using the Miebo Copay Card or pharmacy service BlinkRx. This program aims to make the medication more affordable for those who qualify.\nAdditionally, an article from Amazon Pharmacy states that most customers typically pay around $25 for this medication when insurance is applied, indicating a significant variation in pricing based on coverage.\nWhat Are Miebo Eye Drops? First approved by the FDA in 2021, Miebo eye drops utilize an innovative active ingredient called perfluorohexyloctane to treat signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\nPerfluorohexyloctane works by protecting and stabilizing the tear film layer on the surface of the eyes from evaporation. This enhances lubrication, preventing dry spots from forming on the cornea and conjunctiva.\nUnlike existing artificial tear treatments that provide only temporary wetting relief, Miebo addresses the root cause of unstable tear film homeostasis. This makes it more effective at reducing inflammation, irritation, burning and vision changes related to chronic dry eyes.\nHowever, being a newer brand name drug with exclusive patented technology, Miebo commands a significant price premium compared to older available therapies.\nMiebo Eye Drops Are Expensive Exclusivity – Miebo is currently only available as a brand-name product from its manufacturer, Oyster Point Pharma. No generic versions exist yet on the market. This lack of competition allows the company to command premium pricing.\nYou might also like our articles on the cost of LASIK eye surgery , Cataract surgery , or detached retina surgery .\nAdvanced Formulation – Miebo utilizes an innovative active ingredient not found in other dry eye treatments, which required significant investment to develop and test. The company aims to recoup these R&D costs through higher pricing.\nLimited Alternatives – For patients unresponsive to other dry eye medications, Miebo may represent the best or only effective solution, allowing its manufacturer to leverage its uniqueness.\nInsurance Coverage – Unlike basic artificial tears, Miebo is regulated as a prescription medication, making it eligible for insurance coverage which indirectly raises retail costs across the supply chain.\nFactors That Affect the Cost\nSeveral key factors impact how much an individual will pay out of pocket for Miebo eye drops:\nInsurance Coverage – Insured patients with dry eye medication coverage will have lower costs, with copays potentially as low as $35 or under depending on the plan. Medicare provides limited coverage, reducing costs by about 25%.\nPharmacy Choice – Retail prices can vary significantly between pharmacy chains. Checking multiple pharmacies, including independents, can reveal cost differences up to $200 per bottle.\nDiscount Programs – GoodRx and other discount platforms offer coupons that may reduce the retail cash price by 15-20%. Retailer prescription savings plans also provide discounts.\nSample Offers – When first prescribed, patients can access a free 14-day sample directly from the manufacturer to trial before purchasing.\nHow Can Patients Save? Thankfully, resources exist to help lower Miebo’s out-of-pocket costs for many patients:\nManufacturer Savings Programs\nOyster Point Enroll Copay Program – Insured patients pay as little as $0 per prescription . Covers initial 12 months with re-enrollment option. Must have commercial coverage. Oyster Point Assist Savings Card – Uninsured cash paying patients access up to a 30% discount off the retail price. Provides set discounted pricing around $575 per bottle . Free Samples – 14-day trial bottles are available directly through doctors to allow patient sampling before filling a full script. External Discounts and Coupons\nGoodRx – Popular discount app offers coupons to reduce cash retail prices by 15-18% on average at major pharmacies. SingleCare – Similar discount card to GoodRx offering comparable average savings on Miebo eye drops. Blink Health – Claims to offer up to 80% off prescription costs through negotiated discounted pricing. Pharmacy Discount Programs – Retailers like CVS, Walgreens and Walmart offer special pharmacy membership plans providing member-only savings on medications. Outside of the manufacturer programs, GoodRx and SingleCare offer coupons that can reduce cash retail prices by 15-18% on average . Comparing local pharmacy pricing can also uncover significant cost savings.\nGeneric Alternatives to Miebo With Miebo being a newer, branded medication containing a patented active ingredient, no generic equivalent currently exists on the market. However, other lower cost options for managing dry eye exist:\nArtificial Tears – Over-the-counter eye lubricants like Refresh Optive Advanced provide temporary wetting relief and lubrication but lack Miebo’s mechanism to stabilize tear film. Bottles start under $10 OTC .\nRestasis – Older prescription eye drop that stimulates tear production for chronic dry eye. Generic availability makes it far cheaper than Miebo, around $50-100 per bottle .\nLotemax – Steroid eye drop that reduces inflammation involved in dry eye flares. Generic alternatives to brand Lotemax can treat short-term symptoms.\nFor mild cases, artificial tears may provide adequate relief at a much lower price point than Miebo. But moderate to severe dry eye sufferers often require more advanced treatments only Miebo currently provides.\nIs Miebo Appropriate for You? Because of the high costs involved, it is essential to determine if Miebo eye drops are the most suitable dry eye treatment option through discussion with your ophthalmologist or optometrist.\nFactors to consider include your insurance coverage, severity of your dry eye symptoms, responsiveness to other treatments, and eligibility for financial assistance programs.\nTrying available samples first can indicate if Miebo provides noticeable improvement versus other options before committing to purchase.\nWhere Can Patients Purchase? Miebo eye drops are available at most national retail pharmacies, including:\nCVS Pharmacy Walgreens Rite Aid Walmart Costco Online mail order pharmacies such as ExpressScripts may offer convenience and potential savings through prescription home delivery.\nWhen purchasing in-person, check for available discounts and coupons through apps like GoodRx before paying at the pharmacy counter.\nExpert Insights To gain additional perspective on managing the high costs of emerging medications, we consulted two ophthalmology experts:\n“Don’t automatically assume the newest, most advertised treatment is right for your needs. Have an open conversation with your eye doctor about cheaper alternatives that may work just as well for your symptoms.” – Dr. Michelle Thompson, ASCRS member\n“With ever-rising prescription costs, don’t be afraid to be your own health advocate. Don’t hesitate to ask for discounts, shop around pharmacies, and utilize patient savings programs to make innovative treatments more affordable.” – Dr. Sam Mendez, AAO member\n“Consider enrolling in drug manufacturer savings programs when starting higher cost new prescriptions like Miebo. They can provide copay or discount assistance for the first 6-12 months while determining if the drug is working for you.” – Dr. Michelle Thompson, ASCRS member\n“Explore your insurance plan design closely so you know what to expect at the pharmacy counter. Deductibles, formulary tier placement and covered diagnoses can significantly sway what you’ll pay for a specialty medication.” – Dr. Sam Mendez, AAO member\nFinal Words\nMiebo represents an exciting breakthrough for effectively managing dry eye disease. But its listing price may limit access due to affordability challenges. Fortunately, resources exist to reduce costs, including manufacturer savings programs, insurance coverage, coupons and comparing local pharmacy pricing.\nBy researching available options, patients can determine whether Miebo eye drops fit reasonably within their healthcare budgets. Your ophthalmologist can help guide smart decisions so that you can continue to safely manage dry eye symptoms.\nAnswers to Common Questions\nHow to pay for Miebo?\nThose with insurance can use copay programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Uninsured patients can use the Oyster Point Assist Savings Card for set discounted pricing. Comparing pharmacies and using coupons provide additional savings on the retail cash price.\nCan Miebo be used with other eye drops?\nYes, Miebo can typically be used safely with other eye drop medications like artificial tears or steroid drops. However, check with your eye doctor about any potential interactions or spacing needed between applying different eye medications. Never use medications together without guidance.\nWhat are the most expensive eye drops?\nIn addition to Miebo, other very expensive prescription eye drops used to treat conditions like glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration include Eylea, Lucentis, and Restasis. Yearly costs can easily exceed $10,000 for these specialty medications.",

    "text": "Princess Anne saluted Canadian veterans and current forces members today during a ceremony at British Columbia's legislature cenotaph commemorating the Second World War's Battle of the Atlantic. The princess, King Charles's sister, laid a wreath during the ceremony to mark the war's largest and longest battle, during which Canada lost 24 warships and more than 4,300 Canadian forces and merchant marine members. The ceremony was part of a three day Royal visit to the West Coast that concludes today. Previous stops saw her take part in the commissioning of the first Arctic patrol vessel for Canada's Pacific fleet in North Vancouver and tour the gardens at Victoria's government house. Earlier today, Princess Anne planted a red flowering currant tree and unveiled a plaque at government house to honour her late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Volunteer gardeners at government house said Princess Anne expressed great interest in the various trees and plants on the grounds during her morning tour. Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee, commander of the Royal Canadian Navy, says having the princess attend the Battle of the Atlantic ceremony and sail from North Vancouver to Esquimalt on board HMCS Max Bernays was an honour for Canada's navy.

    "text": "Un médico indio sufrió una repulsiva experiencia luego de percatarse de que el cono de helado que consumía incluía un dedo humano . El evento tuvo lugar en la ciudad de Bombay, donde la policía local abrió una investigación.\nEl inspector de Policía de la estación de Malad, Ravindra Adane, informó que recibieron “una denuncia” , y aseguró que “el dedo está siendo examinado por el departamento forense, tendremos una respuesta en varios días” , según recogió Emol .\nEl doctor de 26 años, cuya identidad no ha sido revelada, declaró que se encontraba disfrutando de su helado cuando dio “un mordisco hacia el centro del cono y sentí que había algo grande” . Según detalló, al hacer contacto con el dedo pensó que “era un trozo de fruto seco o algo, menos mal que no me lo tragué”.\nTras inspeccionar mejor el objeto, comenzó a notar que tenía la forma de un dedo humano “con huellas dactilares”, el hueso y hasta uña . “Soy un doctor, sé a qué se parece el cuerpo humano” , confesó.\nLuego, depositó el dedo en hielo y se acercó a la estación de policía, donde interpuso una denuncia e intentó contactar con la compañía de helados para elevar su queja . El perturbador momento fue registrado en video y compartido en redes sociales, donde se puede ver la situación con mayor detalle, consignó el medio citado.",

    "text": "Ichabod Crane’s boys’ volleyball team is undefeated in the middle of January again, and at the center of it is senior setter Eben Krein.\nAs Ichabod Crane’s sole setter in 2024-25, Krein is averaging just over 33 assists per match, and has felt pretty comfortable with the responsibility he’s been given.\n“Honestly, I was worried there's gonna be a lot of pressure, but I feel like I filled the role pretty good, and I feel like I’m kind of leading this team,” he said. “We’re just trying to keep our heads up and [I’m focused on] putting the ball where it needs to be.”\nWhile this season is the first time Krein is the Riders’ sole setter, with the team running five hitters and one setter as opposed to a 4-2 in 2023-24, he thinks that spending his junior season on the floor for every point was important.\n“It was really helpful,” he said. “Having the year of experience before this, coming into this really helps, easing my way into it.”\nHead coach Sean Connors feels that Krein has stepped up to the level of leadership asked of him this season.\n“The senior setter is going to be basically another coach on the floor, so I give you the tools, it's your offense to run, and he's been doing a nice job,” he said.\nConnors finds that Krein’s style of communication is less verbal than what he’s used to, something he doesn’t mind at all.\n“These guys, if you watch them, they kind of make eye contact, and so I'm very open with them working on the same page, as long as they know how to get there,” he said.\nOne of Krein’s front-row teammates is senior middle Connor McDarby, who feels very well-synced with his setter.\n“We've been playing together for a couple years, and we've been working together to get everything down pat and keep it going,” he said.\nKrein thinks the feeling is mutual.\n“Us being on the same team for the past two years, it just really helped us build a connection,” he said. “He knows where to put the ball, I know where to be, and just being on that same page every practice is just key.”\nWhile Connors thinks that his coach on the floor still has some potential to unlock in his senior year, he believes Krein’s growth across his time at the school has been very rewarding to watch.\n“Compared to when I saw him three or four years ago, I was not sure he'd be where he is today, he's worked very hard,” Connors said. “To see him get emotional and get excited about winning, that motivates me to want to help him get better.”\nIchabod Crane is 8-0 and has only dropped three sets so far, a start which includes a home-away sweep of Catskill after not beating the Cats for three years. Last season saw the Riders start 15-0, with their first defeat coming in February, and Connors is confident there’s more work to be done to make it out of Section 2 for a fifth year in a row.\n“I always tell the guys, ‘You got to win the last game you played,’ and I don't think we're good enough to do that yet,” he said. “We've always got to keep getting better every day coming into the gym, whether it's practice or a game.”\nIchabod Crane visits Section 2’s other remaining undefeated team in Voorheesville on Wednesday.",

    "text": "“Están aprovechando la muerte y lesiones de ciudadanos para tratar de quitar votos a MC”. Foto: Moisés Nava, Cuartoscuro Cuando en 1983 empezó en el norte, específicamente en Juárez, la gran revuelta civil panista, un grupo que sumó mucha fuerza a la ola electoral emergente, fueron los católicos laicos que se identificaban como “carismáticos” y que tenían como centro de reunión espiritual la iglesia de la sagrada familia, en la Avenida del Charro, y como pastor al padre Fong.\nEl discurso de ellos fortaleció mucho al PAN, no sólo por el número, sino por el discurso basado en la moral cristiana, Y aquel movimiento que incendió el desierto chihuahuense se apoyaba mucho en un combate feroz contra la corrupción y promover como proyecto de Gobierno una práctica cristiana asentada en los valores de misericordia, caridad, honestidad, y piedad.\nLo repetían con tanta convicción que la ciudadanía los veía de forma esperanzadora, como una alternativa para cambiar la sociedad que en aquel momento estaba harta de las mentiras de López Portillo y la deshonestidad representada por “El Negro” Durazo y por los políticos priístas del momento.\nNosotros desde la izquierda, no podíamos explicarnos aquella repentina alianza entre los panistas fundadores, “capitalistas cristianos” y un gran número de empresarios que se habían enriquecido, muchos de ellos haciendo negocios con los gobiernos priistas.\nEsa nueva clase política llamados “Neo Panistas” tal vez sea la semilla que se cultivo en la tierra del neoliberalismo, se regó con dinero de los poderosos, se encontró un tesoro en las arcas gubernamental y se convirtió en el PRIAN.\nLos fundadores, han rendido cuentas a la madre naturaleza y regresaron a ella, pero los “neopanistas” sobreviven, siguen perteneciendo a las asociaciones de laicos católicos, algunos rezan diario en misa de las 6 de la mañana, pero hoy los hemos visto luchar con tal ferocidad, con tal capacidad de mentir, de lastimar, de manchar al adversario. Vemos la transformación corrompida de los efectos del ejercicio del poder, del gozo de los privilegios de la práctica gubernamental, que los ha llevado a convertirse en el antípoda de los que iniciaron hace 40 años: el camino hacia la democracia formal en el país.\nTuvieron una metamorfosis inversa a la de las mariposas monarcas, pues estos empezaron brillantes, con atractivos colores, hermoso vuelo, y han terminado con gusanos.\nPero no solo involucionaron en la forma sino que aunque se sigan diciendo cristianos, están muy lejos de aquellos católicos agrupados en torno al padre Fong y de los valores que los impulsaron y que los hacían atractivos para el ciudadano común. Se han transformado.\nVeámoslos frente a la tragedia de Monterrey.\nEstán aprovechando la muerte y lesiones de ciudadanos para tratar de quitar votos a MC, pues ya convencidos de que Claudia gana, defienden su miserable segundo lugar, utilizando todos los recursos más perversos, las mentiras, las suposiciones, las acusaciones hacia los naranjas. Son inmisericordes, han abandonado los valores de la caridad, perdón, misericordia y se han convertido en unos vulgares “impíos hipócritas cristianos”.",

In Scozia, è appena trascorsa la seconda notte senza corrente per circa 1.500 utenze, mentre ieri un fulmine ha causato interruzioni nella fornitura in Galles . La compagnia elettrica Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks ha comunicato di aver ripristinato l’alimentazione per oltre 46mila residenze colpite dalla tempesta, con particolare gravità nelle aree del Nord/Est e nelle Shetland. La società prevede di riconnettere le restanti abitazioni nel corso della giornata odierna e ha organizzato furgoni di emergenza per fornire cibo caldo e bevande ai residenti interessati a partire dalle 9.\nAndy Smith, direttore delle operazioni, ha esposto la difficoltà delle comunità coinvolte in questi due giorni, esprimendo gratitudine per la loro pazienza e supporto mentre le squadre operano instancabilmente per ripristinare l’elettricità. Nel frattempo, la National Grid ha segnalato che nella contea di Ceredigion ben 36.000 case hanno subito interruzioni elettriche a seguito di un fulmine. Purtroppo, la tempesta ha causato la morte di 3 persone il cui veicolo è stato sommerso dal fiume Esk, vicino a Glaisdale, nel North Yorkshire.\nNella giornata precedente, un temporale ha attraversato il Nord/Ovest dell’Inghilterra, seguito da un tornado che ha danneggiato abitazioni a Manchester . Circa 100 edifici sono stati colpiti da quello che la polizia ha descritto come “un tornado localizzato” a Stalybridge, nel Tameside, e nel villaggio di Carrbrook.

Se tienen programadas dos fases. Actualmente se lleva a cabo la primera fase que beneficia a 300 adultos mayores en Baranoa y 75 en cada uno de los corregimientos de Campeche, Sibarco y Pital de Megua. Luego se desarrollará la segunda fase, que alcanzará un total de 600 beneficiarios en Baranoa y 450 en los corregimientos”, manifestó Durán. De igual manera, enfatizó en que “de la mano del alcalde municipal, Edinson Palma, hay un compromiso decidido con la gestión social para cuidar y dignificar a este grupo poblacional, al reconocer la importancia y el valor que los adultos mayores aportan a la comunidad y en los procesos sociales que se desarrollan en la Alcaldía municipal”. Por su parte, Teresa Polo, una de las beneficiarias del programa, dijo que la actividad fue una manera de vivir una experiencia diferente “Me he divertido mucho, tenía tiempo que no bailaba ni hacía ejercicios”. Es de anotar que entre las actividades del programa se encuentran la promoción de entornos saludables, el respeto a los derechos humanos, intervenciones de estimulación psicoafectiva y actividades culturales que revivan costumbres pasadas. Además, se fomentarán iniciativas de emprendimiento para ayudar a los adultos mayores a desarrollar su autonomía y potenciar sus talentos.
