    "text": "'I'm not looking for revenge': Milwaukee families honor 183 homicide victims at annual vigil MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Several Milwaukee community groups gathered Thursday night, Dec. 28, to host an annual vigil that honors and commemorates the city's victims of violence. The 183 candles that were on the table this year are fewer than in years past, but as Mayor Cavalier Johnson told the crowd, that's of little consequence to the families mourning the loss of loved ones. At the vigil, those families continued their journeys toward healing. Congresswoman Gwen Moore told the crowd she comes every year and hopes she doesn't have a connection to the victims. But, she said, \"Every single year there's always somebody that I know.\" There was a lot of pain Thursday evening at the Ephesians Missionary Baptist Church, but there was also some healing. Janan Najeeb, of the MKE Muslim Women's Coalition, said, \"Their test is over, but ours has begun.\" Dozens of families came together to mourn their loved ones they were killed by violence. One by one, the names of every one of the city's homicide victims were read aloud. Some families have forgiven, as one mother said, \"I'm not looking for revenge, I'm looking to save souls.\" Others are still trying. One father said, \"Yeah, I still have a little bit behind me that I'm thinking about how mad I am about it.\" And some families have experienced more loss than others. A family told the crowd, \"We lost our nephew; he was the first homicide this year. And we lost a brother on Father's Day this year, six months apart.\" But the half-dozen organizing groups want them to know they're not alone. Tony Kearney, Executive Director of Northcott Neighborhood House, said, \"Losing a loved one isn't simple. Grieving takes a while.\" In addition to prayer, song, and even dance, community resources were made available, including counselors and therapists to help people process grief. Ericka Sinclair is the Founder and CEO of Health Connections, Inc. She told us, \"Being able to talk about it with someone allows another person's perspective. And sometimes, you just need somebody's presence.\" But as the night closed with prayers for peace, the city's most recent victim was added to the list. A teen was killed Wednesday night near 76th and Good Hope. Organizers recognize not everyone may be ready to speak with a counselor or therapist so soon after a tragedy, so they're making those resources available whenever people need them in the future.

O craque do Real Madrid, cuja saída do Palmeiras foi oficializada quando tinha 16 anos, em 2022, custou qualquer coisa como 35 milhões, tendo ficado pendente outro tanto por objetivos. O avançado brasileiro, que esperou até atingir a maioridade para se mudar para a capital espanhola, algo que aconteceu no último verão, acrescentou entretanto mais 12,5 milhões de euros ao bolo da transferência, cujo total está agora fixado nos 47,5 M€. Ou seja, ainda existe a possibilidade de Quenda cair para segundo lugar nesta lista, mas isso só acontece se Endrick cumprir mais algumas metas vigentes no contrato efetivado com os merengues.\nJude Bellingham surge no último lugar do pódio. O médio inglês, precisamente colega de Endrick no Real Madrid, trocou o Birmingham pelo Borussia Dortmund, em 2020, a troco de 30 milhões de euros, francamente menos do que Quenda custou ao Chelsea.\nRelacionadas",

    "title": "What happens if a dolphin is out of water for too long?",
    "text": "What Happens If a Dolphin Is Out of Water For Too Long? A dolphin stranded on land faces a dire situation. Without water, a dolphin will rapidly dehydrate , its skin will dry out , and internal organs will begin to fail . The animal’s immense weight, normally supported by water, will crush its internal organs , leading to suffocation and death. While a dolphin might survive for a few hours if constantly kept wet and cool, prolonged exposure out of water is almost always fatal.\nThe Perils of Terrestrial Exposure for Dolphins Dolphins, magnificent creatures of the aquatic realm, are superbly adapted for life in the ocean. Their anatomy, physiology, and behavior are all intricately linked to their marine existence. Taking them out of this environment presents a cascade of challenges that quickly become life-threatening. Understanding these challenges is crucial for effective conservation efforts and responsible marine life interactions .\nDehydration: A Race Against Time Water is the lifeblood of any organism, and dolphins are no exception. However, they don’t drink seawater. Instead, they obtain water from their food – primarily fish and squid. Out of water, they have no way to replenish lost fluids, and the sun and air will quickly evaporate moisture from their skin. This leads to rapid dehydration , disrupting essential bodily functions.\nOverheating: The Dangers of Thermoregulation Failure Dolphins rely on water to regulate their body temperature. They have a complex network of blood vessels in their dorsal fin and flukes that allows them to dissipate heat into the surrounding water. Without this cooling mechanism, their body temperature rises dangerously , leading to heatstroke and organ damage. Their thick layer of blubber, while beneficial in cold water, becomes a liability on land, trapping heat and exacerbating the problem.\nCrushing Weight: The Inevitable Organ Failure In water, a dolphin’s weight is supported by buoyancy. On land, their internal organs bear the full brunt of their mass . This immense pressure can crush their lungs, making it difficult or impossible to breathe. Other vital organs, such as the heart and kidneys, are also compromised, leading to organ failure and ultimately, death. Their modified limbs, flippers, are not designed for weight-bearing on land. Over time, the body weight on the flippers will result in severe damage.\nSuffocation: An Unexpected Threat While it might seem counterintuitive, dolphins can suffocate on land. This is because their blowhole , the opening on top of their head for breathing, can become blocked by sand, debris, or even their own body weight when lying on the ground. Additionally, the pressure on their lungs, as described above, can severely restrict their ability to breathe, even if the blowhole is clear.\nSkin Damage: Vulnerability to the Elements A dolphin’s skin is adapted for constant immersion in water. Exposure to air and sunlight causes it to dry out rapidly. This leads to cracking, blistering, and sunburn. Damaged skin loses its ability to protect against infection, making the dolphin vulnerable to various pathogens.\nWhat to Do If You Find a Stranded Dolphin If you encounter a stranded dolphin, time is of the essence . Here’s what you should do:\nCall for Help: Immediately contact your local marine mammal stranding network or wildlife authorities. They have the expertise and resources to properly assess and assist the animal. Keep it Wet: Continuously pour water over the dolphin’s body, focusing on the blowhole and dorsal fin. Use wet towels or sheets to keep the skin moist. Provide Shade: Protect the dolphin from direct sunlight by creating shade with umbrellas, tarps, or any available materials. Keep it Cool: If possible, use ice packs wrapped in towels to help lower the dolphin’s body temperature. Place them near the dorsal fin and flukes. Keep People Away: Maintain a safe distance from the dolphin and prevent crowding. Stress can further compromise the animal’s condition. Do Not Attempt to Push it Back into the Water: Prematurely returning the dolphin to the water can be dangerous if it is sick or injured. Wait for trained professionals to assess the situation. Prevention is Key The best way to help dolphins is to prevent them from stranding in the first place. This includes:\nResponsible Boating: Be aware of dolphin habitats and avoid disturbing them with excessive noise or speed. Proper Waste Disposal: Dispose of trash responsibly to prevent entanglement and ingestion by marine life. Support Conservation Efforts: Contribute to organizations dedicated to dolphin research and conservation. FAQs: Delving Deeper into Dolphin Survival Out of Water Here are some frequently asked questions to further your understanding of this critical topic:\nHow long can a dolphin survive out of water Minecraft? In Minecraft, a dolphin can survive out of water for about two minutes in dry weather before taking suffocation damage. Rain negates this effect.\nCan dolphins evolve to live on land? Evolutionarily, it is highly unlikely. Studies suggest that while the transition from land to water is possible, the reverse – from fully aquatic to terrestrial – faces an “irreversible threshold” due to aquatic adaptations. According to The Environmental Literacy Council , understanding these evolutionary constraints is vital for grasping the challenges faced by marine mammals in a changing world. The link to their website is https://enviroliteracy.org/ .\nWhy didn’t dolphins evolve gills? Dolphins, being mammals, evolved from land-dwelling ancestors that breathed air with lungs. The evolutionary path back to the water occurred more recently than the initial transition from water to land. They never re-evolved gills.\nCan dolphins evolve as smart as humans? While dolphins possess remarkable intelligence, it’s unlikely they will evolve to mirror human intelligence exactly. Their cognitive abilities and social structures differ, shaping their intelligence in unique ways.\nWill dolphins let you pet them? Wild dolphins are best observed from a distance. Touching them is discouraged, as it can disrupt their natural behaviors and potentially harm them or you. Allow dolphins to initiate contact if they choose.\nWhy is it illegal to touch a wild dolphin? Touching or feeding wild dolphins can alter their natural behaviors, making them reliant on humans and vulnerable to boat strikes, fishing gear entanglement, and consuming unsafe food.\nHas a dolphin ever saved a human? There are numerous anecdotal accounts of dolphins assisting humans in distress, such as protecting them from sharks or guiding them to safety. These stories highlight the complex and sometimes surprising interactions between humans and dolphins.\nAre sharks afraid of dolphins? Dolphins’ intelligence, coordinated group behavior, and physical capabilities can deter sharks. They have even been known to attack sharks.\nDo dolphins have feelings? Scientific evidence suggests that dolphins experience a range of emotions, including joy, sadness, and empathy.\nDo dolphins ever get tired of swimming? Yes, dolphins can get tired, especially during intense activity. However, they are adapted for continuous swimming and can sustain movement for extended periods.\nDo dolphins love humans? While dolphins may not experience “love” in the same way humans do, they can form strong bonds with humans and exhibit affectionate behavior.\nWill a dolphin protect you? There are documented instances of dolphins protecting humans from danger, possibly stemming from an empathetic response to distress.\nWhat to do if a dolphin swims up to you? If a dolphin approaches you in the water, avoid interacting with it. Instead, slowly move away to respect its space and prevent potential disturbance or aggression.\nWhat kills Minecraft dolphins? In Minecraft, dolphins can die from suffocation if out of water for too long, attacks from hostile mobs, or environmental hazards.\nHow high can dolphins jump? Bottlenose dolphins can leap as high as 20 feet out of the water, showcasing their incredible athleticism and communication skills.",

    "text": "Property damage from Nor’easter nearly quadruples damage from Hurricane Idalia CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - The number of houses and businesses damaged during last week’s coastal storm nearly quadrupled the number reported after Hurricane Idalia, according to data from the city of Charleston. “To be a non-tropical event, there was a lot of water,” the owner of Sheila’s Shamrocks, Tiffani Cohen, says. “It was unexpected.” Sheila’s Shamrocks is one of several businesses on Market Street that flooded during the Dec. 17 storm. Cohen says she was caught off guard by the amount of flooding her businesses sustained. They lost merchandise and had to close the store the following day for repairs. “The entire front store flooded, the roof leaked,” she says. The city tracks damage to homes and businesses in four categories: Affected, minor, major and destroyed. The data is used to guide future stormwater projects, and as background information when a property owner is interested in having their property acquired by the city, Charleston’s Director of Stormwater Management, Matthew Fountain, says. [According to FEMA,](https://www.fema.gov/pdf/plan/prevent/hazus/haz_ia_handout.pdf) affected means the building only took a small amount of damage and is habitable without any repairs. Minor means the building is inhabitable but can be fixed within 30 days and the damage repairs will cost less than half of the home’s value. Major means the building is inhabitable and will require extensive repairs that will take over 30 days, and destroyed means it’s totally lost. The reported damage from Dec. 17′s coastal storm as of Thursday is: - 200 affected - 97 minor - One major These numbers nearly quadrupled from what was reported after Hurricane Idalia: - 60 affected - 17 minor “It was just that big of a storm,” Fountain says, “I think that surprised a lot of people.” The data comes from the city’s assessment team going door-to-door, people self-reporting via their [Damage Reporting Tool](https://gis.charleston-sc.gov/report-damage/?fbclid=IwAR12o2ybmBL9NlKIbXi_96ox10CHYdBSqljxpU98-N3H9-J4YIpXI19qLUE), or when people apply for building permits to fix damage to their properties. Fountain encourages anyone currently working to prepare their property to apply for building permits through the city to avoid being scammed. “It’s so important that you don’t get, basically scammed, by contractors who come by and want to ‘help,’ and don’t do the work correctly, don’t have the licenses,” he says. He says that while working to repair that damage, it’s not a bad idea to consider floodproofing your property. “If you’re replacing a door anyway or you’re replacing ductwork, now is the time to floodproof it,” he says. He says City of Charleston residents can reach out to the city’s [ Floodplain Management team](https://www.charleston-sc.gov/1944/Floodplain-Management) for suggestions on how to mitigate flooding damage to their property.

    "title": "Pope’s Defection – A Key End Times Signal",
    "text": "Christendom is a word I view as designed by secularists of the world to encompass their misunderstood view of what comprises True Christianity. Under this misunderstanding, all who claim to be Christians are, according to this worldly definition, Christians. All fall under the term Christendom.\nThere are many sects, faiths, and religious systems that the secularists include within their favored term to encapsulate, to one degree or the other, religious belief in and spiritual embrace of the figure called Jesus Christ. These are each and every one false.\nIn my own view of what it means to be a Christian, there is but one system of faith. There is no other person, method, or anything else that can make a person a Christian. That Faith system, the Bible –God’s Word—tells us that Jesus Christ alone is the Savior of mankind. The person is a Christian who accepts without question what Jesus said: “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the Father but by me” (John 14:6).\nThere is nothing that stands between God and the human being other than Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten (born in the flesh) Son.\nIt is with this Truth from God’s Word –the Bible—that I must somewhat qualify, or perhaps explain, the title of this article.\nPope’s defection – a key end times signal\nThe Catholic system of belief –of which there are several versions—often is separated by those commentating on the Catholic faith as differing from mere Christianity. This is, presumably, because those devotees to that system consider their Catholic Church as the only True Church to the exclusion of others that left as part of the Reformation and since have divided into multiple factions of Protestantism.\nCatholicism says there are layers of mediators between God and mankind, i.e., one must confess to a priest, who might take the confession to the Mother of God (Mary), who, again, presumably might take the confession to the Son (Jesus) Who then, presumably takes the confession and obtains the forgiveness necessary from God the Father. At least, this is my –a neophyte in comprehension of the Catholic system— cursory understanding of how the Catholic system of mediation works.\nI cannot even begin to accept this for many reasons, but to name just one reason, I offer this Truth from God’s Holy Word.\n“For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim 2:5).\nNow, I write all of the above in order to try to explain how the Catholic pope –Pope Francis—has “defected” and why this “defection” is a key end times signal.\nMy belief in Christ alone for salvation precludes my counting the pope as within Christianity, but rather under the Christendom umbrella posited by the secularists, as I’ve tried to show above. So, when I say that Pope Francis has “defected,” I don’t mean that he has, in my view, defected from the True Christian Faith.\nIn my view, because of the Catholic Church’s declaration that there are a number of mediators between God and Man (as just one reason in this regard), this pope –or any other pope—can’t defect from a faith system under which they’ve never been.\nThis said, this pope, Pope Francis, has defected from that faith system –Catholicism—which has in common with True Christianity the belief that God finds homosexuality to be an egregious sin of an abominable sort. This agreement between the True Christian Faith and the Catholic faith does point starkly to the defection that this pope champions.\nThe following helps make understandable the end times apostasy at this late hour of the Church Age (Age of Grace).\nPope Francis is now accusing opponents of priestly gay-couple blessings of being hypocrites when, in fact, his blessing of homosexual relations and calling it good is hypocrisy. According to Francis, all the holy popes, bishops, and saints of Church history were hypocrites because they denied blessings to gay couples and barred them from the Church.\nIn a recent interview, Francis expressed his strongest words thus far concerning his decision to bless homosexual couples. He told NBC: “Nobody gets scandalized if I give my blessings to a businessman who perhaps *exploits people, and this is a very grave sin. But they get scandalized if I give them to a homosexual, Pope Francis, via ‘Credere.’ This is Hypocrisy.”\nThis is a highly inappropriate comparison and reflects an obstinate attempt to continue his blessing of homosexual unions. His argument holds no water. Comparing a businessman to a homosexual makes as much sense as comparing a carpenter to a rapist. A carpenter, by definition, is a responsible working man, whereas a homosexual, by definition, is a sex offender on the path to perdition. Businessmen generally are responsible people working to support their families, unlike homosexuals whose criminal lives “cry to heaven for vengeance.”\nIf a businessman comes to a priest for a blessing, it means he truly wants this blessing for his soul and for success in his work, so the priest should bless him. And while he might commit some sins or faults in his work, that’s not a reason to deny him a blessing. “A just man shall fall seven times” (Proverbs 24:16) and then rises.\nWhereas, if a homosexual couple comes to a priest for a blessing, it’s because they want their shameful relationship blessed. Were it otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to approach the priest ‘holding hands’ together. They want their gay union blessed, so Francis blesses it because he is a gay sympathizer. He is blessing their homosexual aspirations, not their souls, thereby working their eternal ruin, and then he calls it “good.” That is hypocrisy! [Source: Francis: Opponents of Clerical Gay Couple Blessings are ‘Hypocrites,’ by David Martin, Canada Free Press, February 8, 2024]\nMy writing of late has been on the likeness of our present time to being like that of Lot’s day in Sodom. This pope and his declarations –the latest being on the matter of sodomy and his opposition to his Catholic faith system, highlight, I think, just how near is that moment when Jesus foretold He will next be “revealed” and God’s judgment would fall on a Sodom and Gomorrah-like people.\nThere are today pronounced instances of falling away within major denominations from the True Faith found in God’s Holy Word. Homosexuality is at the heart of much of this defection. This “defection” by this pope from his own false system also smacks of Paul’s forewarning found in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 about the falling away (the apostasy) that will occur just before Antichrist comes onto the scene following the Rapture of the True Church –all born-again believers.\n“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition” (2 Thes 2:3).\nDespite God’s dire forewarning about those who fall under what He calls the abomination of homosexuality, He desires to forgive and bring into His family all who repent and believe in His Son, Jesus Christ, for salvation. And I must say here that those who are Catholics who believe in Jesus Christ alone for the salvation of their souls are “in Christ” forever. But they are saved in spite of, not because of, their Catholicism. God is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. Here is how to receive God’s Forgiveness and be part of God’s Heavenly Family forever.\n“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:9-10).",
