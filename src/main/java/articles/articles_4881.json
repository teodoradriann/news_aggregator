    "title": "Even at low levels, early bisphenol A (BPA) exposure is hazardous to later health, study shows",
    "text": "Early exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) may increase your risk of developing conditions such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity later in life, even in small doses, a recent study has found.\nBPA is a type of chemical widely found in consumer and industrial products, especially in processed food and food packaging. An endocrine disruptor, it is known to cause hormonal problems that contribute to chronic disease as you age.\nThe study, published [September 2024] in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, is the first of its kind to assess the relationship between BPA exposure and cardiometabolic health outcomes from childhood to adolescence, using a large variety of health markers.\nCardiometabolic health refers to the overall health of your heart and blood vessels, and your body’s ability to process nutrients, regulate blood sugar, and maintain a healthy weight.\n“Our results point to the need to reduce exposure to BPA in the early stages of life,” say the researchers, led by Sofia Almeida Costa at the Institute of Public Health at the University of Porto (ISPUP) in Portugal.\nTo gauge its effects on the body from dietary sources over time, Costa and her colleagues followed 3,138 children and adolescents, ages 4 to 13, from a prospective Portuguese birth cohort.\nBisphenol A exposure most common through diet, plastics\nFood and beverages are considered the most significant source of human exposure to BPA. Ultra-processed foods, for instance, heavily rely on plastics for production and packaging, and chemicals can migrate into food from food processing equipment and packaging, among other ways.\nIn Portugal, 57% of the food items consumed by the population in 2015–2016 were reported with associated packaging materials, including 69% plastic materials and 3% metal.\nAfter accounting for factors such as diet and energy intake, the researchers found higher BPA exposure was linked to certain health risk factors, including:\n- Higher blood insulin levels and insulin resistance, which means the body can’t use the hormone insulin properly to regular blood sugar (glucose) levels\n- Higher body mass index (BMI), which uses height and weight to classify weight as healthy or unhealthy\n- Increased fat mass, an increased amount of body fat relative to total body weight\n- Larger waist circumference, which measures abdominal fat\n“We conclude that global strategies need to be developed and implemented to mitigate bisphenol A exposure,” the researchers say. “This demands modifications, not only in consumer behaviors, but also in the adoption of innovative approaches by the food and food packaging industries, to ensure a substantial reduction of BPA exposure.”\nPrecise data builds on evidence of BPA-related health harms\nWhile it is unknown exactly how BPA interacts with our bodies to harm health, previous research shows an association between higher levels of BPA and an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and death.\nUnlike most other studies, however, the researchers in Portugal say they combined direct and indirect methods of assessment to more precisely estimate and predict BPA exposure.\nThese included detailed food consumption diaries and extensive collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, blood biomarkers and urine samples. They also adjusted for several relevant variables, including total energy intake, which is usually not considered, researchers say.\nParticipants provided detailed information about each food and beverage consumed, including their place and time, food preparation method, brand, quantity consumed, and packaging materials (only for a 13-year follow-up).\nThe availability of 24-hour urine samples, and the highly sensitive method used to determine BPA concentrations at relatively low levels, also allowed for a more precise estimate of the total daily exposure, they say. BPA leaves the body quickly, and levels can vary throughout the day.\n“Urgent” call to reduce BPA daily exposure\nIncreased public awareness and regulation changes have reduced BPA usage in some countries, but BPA substitutes (BPS, BPF) are less studied and may have harmful health impacts.\nThe main focus of BPA regulations in the U.S. is food contact applications, especially those designed for children. Ways to avoid chemical exposures include eating homemade food when possible, avoiding plastic food packaging, and not using canned food and beverages.\nThe latest study has several limitations, such as the better health characteristics of the eligible participants, the researchers say. Adolescents at the 13-year follow-up may have underreported food packaging materials, and types of food industry packaging material also may have changed between 2005 and 2020, when the study was conducted.\nLastly, “the single effect of BPA on multiple health outcomes may be too reductionist since consumers are exposed to a large variety of food matrix, nutrients, food contaminants and environmental endocrine disruptors,” the researchers say.\nStill, they caution that the need to globally reduce BPA daily exposure remains “urgent.”\n“[Adverse] health effects are expected when exposure chronically exceeds safety levels, even at low doses,” they say. “The results of this study will help public health researchers all over the world, food safety agencies, and policymakers to develop new and relevant guidelines, recommendations, and food policies.”\nTo proactively avoid toxic chemical exposures, see the University of California-San Francisco’s comprehensive guide.\nReferences\nCosta SA, Severo M, Lopes C, Torres D.

    "text": "‘All of a Sudden, Joe Blow Can See the CEO's Emails’ You should probably be very careful about how you set up Microsoft Copilot. Good Morning! Here are today’s highlights: Deporting millions of people will be complex, time-consuming, and expensive. Even legally authorized immigrants fear getting caught up in the raids. A beloved shopkeeper who wasn’t accepted at first gets a special sendoff. Ozempic and the other new weight-loss drugs could destroy the junk-food industry. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Microsoft is trying to fix Copilot’s “over-sharing” problem: “You know when a colleague overshares at work? It's awkward at best. Microsoft's Copilot has been doing an AI version of this behavior, which has unnerved corporate customers so much that some have delayed deploying the product, as Business Insider first reported last week. Now, the software giant is trying to fix the problem. On Tuesday, Microsoft released new tools and a guide to help customers mitigate a Copilot security issue that inadvertently let employees access sensitive information, such as CEO emails and HR documents.” “Copilot's magic — its ability to create a 10-slide road-mapping presentation, or to summon up a list of your company's most profitable products — works by browsing and indexing all of your company's internal information, like the web crawlers used by search engines.” “Historically, IT departments at some companies have set up lax permissions for who can access internal documents — selecting ‘allow all,’ say, for the company's HR software, rather than going through the trouble of selecting specific users. That never created much of a problem, because there wasn't a tool that an average employee could use to identify and retrieve sensitive company documents — until Copilot.” “As a result, some customers have deployed Copilot, only to discover that it can enable employees to read an executive's inbox or access sensitive HR documents. ‘Now, when Joe Blow logs into an account and kicks off Copilot, they can see everything,’ said one Microsoft employee familiar with customer complaints. ‘All of a sudden Joe Blow can see the CEO's emails.’” READ MORE Keep reading with a 7-day free trial Subscribe to The 21 Hats Morning Report to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives.",

    "text": "*Originally published on March 6, 2020: If you just aren't familiar with preparing your home or apartment for winter, listen up! Homeowners and apartment dwellers, we've got some top tips to help you keep your water pipes from freezing and, ultimately, avoid a costly plumbing repair! When water freezes, it expands, and that can cause your water pipes to expand and burst—even if they're plastic. The trick is to identify trouble areas first. The pipes that are most prone to freezing include exposed pipes in unheated areas of the home (i.e., the garage, any plumbing that's located on the exterior of the home, and pipes located in poorly insulated exterior walls). This includes your [garden hose spigot](https://amzn.to/3zEIxUt)! Insulating pipes is usually an effective and low-cost option. Your local hardware store should be able to point you in the right direction. Also, you can purchase a [faucet insulator](https://amzn.to/3NEyFC5) for your outdoor spigot—it's a few dollars but well worth the extra protection. You should also turn your outdoor water off, open your spigot to let the remaining water drain out, and have your sprinklers blown out. As for the pipes inside your home ... - Keep your [thermostat](https://amzn.to/31wavoI)at 55 degrees or higher to prevent freezing, and keep it on both night and day. - Leave cabinets open to allow warmer air to reach the piping under sinks. - Let your [faucets](https://amzn.to/3HAEVoZ)drip, as that will help prevent freezing. If you're really unsure about your current plumbing situation, it's always wise to have a plumber come check things out. *This post may contain affiliate links, at no additional cost to you, and OurCommunityNow.com may earn a small commission.",

    "title": "Be very afraid of wage theft",
    "text": "Be very afraid of wage theft\nStarting 1 January 2025, Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Act 2023 will come into force, introducing criminal penalties for wage theft.\nIn recent class actions, employers proven to have intentionally underpaid or withheld employee wages and entitlements may face up to 10 years in prison and fines reaching $1.5 million for individuals or $7.8 million for corporations. This represents a significant shift in wage theft enforcement from civil to criminal penalties, creating a strong deterrent and aligning federal policies with existing state laws in Queensland. This is not a new concept as it is already a criminal offence in Victoria. This will however unify the rest of Australia.\nThe legislation specifically targets deliberate underpayment, while isolated or unintentional errors, if quickly corrected, will not typically be prosecuted as wage theft. The legislation differentiates between inadvertent payroll errors (considered unintentional underpayments) and wage theft, which requires clear evidence that the employer acted with intent to shortchange employees.\nPractices can become unstuck if they think there may be a mistake with payroll and do not follow up or seek a second opinion or if an employee comes to them with concerns about their payslip and no action is taken. Negligent actions in these circumstances can lead to wage theft accusations or back payments to staff with additional hefty fines. Small businesses that proactively comply with the upcoming Voluntary Small Business Wage Compliance Code may avoid prosecution and can seek cooperation agreements with the Fair Work Ombudsmen by self-reporting any violations.\nFurther information relating to the Voluntary Small Business Wage Compliance Code will be in subsequent WR News and PMA News articles.\nPractice owners, managers and payroll services need to be aware of the appropriate and relevant penalties applicable to their practice staff in accordance with their relevant award. This includes understanding when overtime, penalty rates or allowances should be paid. The low-risk operating position is to keep in mind that employees should remain better off overall in any arrangement or agreement made between the employee and the practice. This will help reduce the chances of underpayments occurring.\nEnhanced investigative powers for the Fair Work Ombudsmen, including collaboration with law enforcement are also part of the act to bolster enforcement capabilities and deter non-compliance across industries.\nThis reform, part of the government’s broader efforts to improve job security and employee protections, underscores a zero-tolerance approach to wage theft which aims to bolster employee’s rights and deter intentional exploitation in the workplace. In relation to employers not complying with workplace laws, Mr Patrick Turner (Employment Lawyer with Maurice Blackburn) has been quoted by ABC News to say “It just reflects the need to treat wage theft just as seriously as we currently treat theft by employees and there needs to be criminal penalties for people who deliberately underpay their staff”.\nMonths after NSW Health reached a $230 million settlement and the ACT Government reached a $31.5 million settlement in similar cases, the Federal Court has found a Victorian Health Service took a “highly irresponsible attitude” towards its obligations regarding the payment of unrostered overtime to junior doctors.\nLawyers involved in wage theft class actions on behalf of thousands of junior doctors says Victorian public health services may face millions of dollars in fines after a court found one of them “expressly and brazenly” instructed trainees to perform unpaid overtime.\nGordon Legal and Hayden Stephens and Associates, the law firms representing ASMOF and Junior Doctors in the unpaid overtime cases say “once the penalties are assessed for the thousands of junior doctors across the state, penalties may run into tens of millions of dollars”.\n[Australian Salaried Medical Officers’ Federation v Peninsula Health (No 3) [2024] FCA 1255 (31 October 2024)]http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FCA/2024/1255.html\nASMOF & Anor v Peninsula Health VID115/2021\nThe above cases are a demonstration of what is happening in the public hospital space, for private practice queries contact AMA Queensland’s Workplace Relations Team who have essential expertise in helping private practice prevent and understand wage-related incidences occurring.

    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- News Direct) --News Direct-- Comcast is connecting more than 2,200 previously unserved homes and businesses across Madera County, California to reliable, high speed, symmetrical Internet by expanding its Network to the region, enhancing digital infrastructure, promoting economic growth, and positioning residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The network expansion brings residents and businesses in Madera, Chowchilla and other nearby communities, Internet, mobile, entertainment and security services from Xfinity and Comcast Business services to residents and businesses for the first time. The expansion is made possible by a nearly $17 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private funding by Comcast. Comcast also recently announced it has received an additional $26 million FFA grant to expand its fiber-rich network in Tulare County, which will bring broadband services to nearly 6,200 unserved locations by early 2026, continuing Comcast's efforts to help close the digital divide in the Central Valley. “I'm thankful to Comcast and the CPUC for their partnership and their continued investments within our great community to bring digital access for our students, families, seniors and businesses to thrive,” said Supervisor Jordan Wamhoff, Madera County Board of Supervisors.“These investments will help bridge the digital divide many Madera County residents experience and help enhance the overall quality of life for our rural communities.” “The CPUC's decision to award Comcast the Madera County FFA grant builds on our continued efforts in working tirelessly to close the digital divide across the Central Valley,” added David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President of Comcast California.“This expansion will support our ongoing network expansion efforts in the Central Valley, in cities such as Biola, Planada, Caruthers, Le Grand and Gustine.
