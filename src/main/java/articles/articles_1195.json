    "text": "Dr Akmal\nSHAH ALAM – Umno Youth chief Dr Muhamad Akmal Saleh criticised the proposal by DAP Perak Chairman Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham for the government to appoint non-Muslim experts to assist the Assessing Competencies of State Legislative Assemblies in Enacting Islamic Laws Special Committee.\nDescribing Beruas MP’s suggestion as inappropriate, Akmal said that Ngeh’s action demonstrates a lack of understanding regarding the sensitivity of Muslims in the country.\n“Sharia law applies only to Muslims; hence, there is no need for nor any requirement for such a suggestion from Ngeh Koo Ham.\n“Leaders like this become a thorn in the flesh for the unity government,” he said in a Facebook post yesterday.\nFollowing this, Akmal urged DAP leaders to safeguard sensitivities for the sake of unity within the unity government.\n“Anthony Loke (DAP Secretary-General) can choose whether to protect such leaders or preserve intra-party relationships within the unity government.\n“If they choose to protect leaders like this, then we can forget about the unity in the unity government. Enough is enough!” he said.\nEarlier, Ngeh said that the step was to consider the views of non-Muslims before any changes to the law were made.\nHe also reminded that the Constitution was formed considering the interests of all groups; thus, any changes affecting races and religions should be comprehensively discussed to avoid conflicts.\nThe Special Committee on Assessing the Competencies of State Legislative Assemblies in Enacting Islamic Laws was responsible for examining issues involving federal and state jurisdiction, particularly regarding the competency of State Legislative Assemblies in enacting Islamic laws and the jurisdiction of courts, as stipulated in the Constitution.",

    "text": "US sports-centric streaming television service FuboTV secured revenues of $386 million during the third quarter of 2024, exceeding expectations. The service’s Q3 financial results, unveiled today, show that it also reduced its net loss during the three months up to September 30, with that figure now coming to $54.7 million, down from $84.4 million during Q3 of 2023. The streamer also saw a 6% increase in subscribers during the three months, with that total (at the end of September) amounting to 1.99 million. David Gandler, chief executive at Fubo, commented on the results: “We continue to be encouraged by a quickly maturing streaming market and our ability to deliver on consumer needs.\" Gandler also commented on the Fubo lawsuit against the joint Venu sports vehicle, a joint venture formed to house the collective sports rights of the Fox Corp, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Disney media giants. With a trial set for October next year, Gandler has now said: “We are confident in the merits of our claims and believe the preliminary injunction will remain in place despite the defendant's pending appeal.” How well do you really know your competitors?

Late last month, Fubo announced the launch of a set of standalone premium subscription services, enabling its customers to subscribe to select live and on-demand content without a base Fubo channel plan. FanDuel Sports Network (formerly Bally Sports Network), NBA League Pass, and Paramount+ With Showtime will be the first networks offered to customers as standalone subscriptions.",

    "title": "福耀科技大\"天塌了\"!东方理工奖励20万、免学费：抢660左右生源|科大|学校|学业奖学金_网易订阅",
    "text": "最近网上都在说浙江高考的事。有个叫福耀科技大学的学校，老板是玻璃大王曹德旺，花了100多亿建的。今年才招50个本科生，全部要660分以上。学费比公立大学便宜，还保证老师和学生比例1比6，读完本科还能接着读研读博。不过另一个新学校更狠。\n东方理工大学老板叫虞仁荣，做半导体的，砸了300多亿。他们盯着浙江高考前7000名，分数也是660上下。前5000名能拿20万奖学金还免四年学费，后面每低一千名少拿5万。光浙江就招80人，比福耀科大补贴力度大多了。\n现在家长都愁死了。有孩子考到985分数线的家庭在纠结，到底选老牌学校还是新学校。有人说东方理工给的奖学金加上免学费，四年下来能省八九十万。也有家长担心新学校没历史，万一教得不好怎么办。\n其实这两所学校都是第一次招本科生。福耀科大虽然有钱，但发的论文没东方理工多。东方理工靠着老板的半导体资源，实验室早几年就开始出成果了。不过钱多也不一定留得住老师，听说有些教授两边兼职。\n学生自己也犯难。有人想赌一把，觉得新学校起点高，赶上行业风口可能更好找工作。有人觉得稳妥，毕竟老牌大学导师人脉广，就业方便。选哪个都像买彩票，因为大家都不知道新学校能不能撑过十年。\n有老教师说，民办学校靠奖学金只能吸引一时。关键还是要看教学质量。福耀科大校长王树国挺有人气，东方理工靠钱砸科研，但首届生源质量直接影响以后名声。如果今年招不到好学生，以后翻身更难。\n网上各种议论，有人说这是资本在玩教育投资，有人说给学生多了选择机会。现在两所学校都在拼命证明自己。福耀科大说要做应用型人才，东方理工主打前沿科技。到底谁赢？得等毕业生就业情况才知道。\n最近浙江考生都在填志愿，朋友圈都在讨论这件事。有学生算过，选东方理工相当于白读还能赚二十万，但万一学校没办起来怎么办？也有人说福耀科大虽然资源少，但玻璃行业稳定，至少实习机会多。\n很多家长去学校官网看了好久，资料里写得都很好。但没人知道实验室实际什么样，教授是不是真用心带学生。有自媒体博主去福耀科大看了校区，说是设备新但老师办公室空着，好像还没到位。\n现在大家只能看两所学校今年招了多少高分学生。如果都没完成计划，可能明年更难。有老师分析说，私立学校想活下去必须快速出成果，不然资金链断了就完蛋。但科研不可能一蹴而就，时间太紧。\n现在两所学校都在抢人，至于谁能撑得住，只能等时间看吧。\n声明：个人原创，仅供参考",

    "title": "Epidemic of diseases spreading in Gaza could harm injured IDF soldiers, experts say",
    "text": "The rate of disease infections spreading among the population in the Gaza Strip is rising, with local doctors reporting a lack of means to monitor the situation before it deteriorates. The World Health Organization's emergency director in the Middle East, Rick Brennan, warns that epidemics could break out in Gaza \"very rapidly\" in the absence of early detection measures. Read more: Israel has been very careful about delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, part of which is routinely seized by Hamas terrorists. Moreover, international health organizations warning about the situation in Gaza have not succeeded in delivering medicines or even checking on the Israeli hostages held by Hamas for almost three months. In recent days, Israel has expressed concerns that IDF soldiers might be exposed to dangerous infections, fungi and molds growing in the Gaza soil contaminated from sewage leaks. This week, it was reported that a soldier died of a fungus he contracted in Gaza. The soldier lost both legs due to the injury, and the wound likely was exposed to the contaminated ground at that time. He was initially treated at Assuta Ashdod Hospital and later transferred to Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center to receive specialized treatment for the severe infection that spread throughout his body. \"This is something that happens in combat zones, not just in Gaza,\" Dr. Bibiana Hazan, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Emek Medical Center, explained to Ynet. \"Medical literature reports that it also happened in the wars of American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. War injuries are very complex, and when it comes to a non-sterile environment like a battlefield, it can be dangerous.\" \"Bacteria and fungi are part of our environment, and when they 'settle' on an area that is very damaged due to lack of tissue, pressure, and poor blood supply, then the place can easily become infected. The bacteria and fungi in Gaza are no different from the bacteria and fungi we have here. What makes these infections so complex and dangerous is the condition of the wound from the start,\" she added. Currently in Gaza, the number of cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years old jumped at a monthly rate of 20 times to more than 100,000. There were also cases of respiratory infection as well as many cases of chicken pox, scabies, lice and various skin infections. Dr. Tahrir al-Sheikh, a pediatrician, worked at the Al Nasser hospital, and was forced to move to southern Gaza when the war broke out. There she provides medical services in a school that has become a place of refuge for displaced Gazans. \"We used to take cultures, and adjust the treatment according to the results. Now it is impossible to do this, and infectious diseases are spreading,\" she said. She said that she treated a four-month-old baby who had severe diarrhea and also said there is a lack of coronavirus tests. \"I had cases of patients who did not respond to treatment, but I could not tell if they had corona, because there is no the diagnostic equipment,\" she said. UNRWA's director of communications, Juliet Touma, visited the facility in Khan Younis that can accommodate about 1,000 people and has turned into a shelter for about 30,000. \"400 people share one toilet. There is not enough water for showers and cleaning and there are not enough hygiene products,\" she said.",

    "title": "#36 La Facultad de Ciencias de la Información de la Complutense confirma que Vito Quiles miente y no es licenciado en periodismo",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#5](c5#c-5) Es cloaquero porque miente más que habla, y lo hace para enfangar.\nY me disgusta el nombre, porque la gente que trabaja en las cloacas hace un trabajo muy digno y necesario.\n#_2 Si el encargado de prensa de un político alardea de licenciatura y resulta que es mentira es un escándalo y debería dimitir de cualquier relación politica que pueda tener.\nPara otro día dejamos que un señor que quiere vivir de paguitas públicas le vacile al empresario que ha montado un medio de comunicación, porque tiene cachindeíto.\nAnda que no hay gente que NO termina la carrera y luego se cuelgan medallas como si la hubieran terminado.\nEn mi opinión, cuando es alguien muy conocido debería ser algo que se pueda consultar públicamente. Veo bien que tener un título pueda ser algo privado, que no se pueda saber si tienes X o Y titulación si no lo dices tú, pero una vez lo dices, no veo mal que se pueda consultar, sobre todo en casos como este donde la persona es muy conocida.\nEs tan mentiroso que si le das un reloj y le quita las pilas, este no llegaría dar la hora correcta dos veces al día.\nEn realidad aunque tuviera el título (la facultad dice que no), tampoco sería periodista.\n[#31](c31#c-31) puedo imaginar que lo diría porque era lo que en ese momento sentía y creía. ¿Que esa afirmación era su voluntad en ese momento de su vida? No lo dudo\nEsto nos pasa a todos a diario, ¿somos ilusos? claro que si. Todos y en todo momento, en caso contrario seríamos videntes con la capacidad de hablar hoy sabiendo todo lo que pasará en el futuro.\nPues hay que ser muy lerdo, negado, para no acabar la carrera de periodismo, esas carreras de pintar y colorear; Si me dijeras una carrera de ciencias, quizás.\nMira que no valer ni pa eso.\nAlvise es un tentetieso para salir de Ayuso. Me dan ganas de votar cada noticia de Alvise SPAM a partir de ahora.\n[#17](c17#c-17) A ver, que ya sabíamos que le comías los huevos a pagascal con absoluta efusividad, no hacía falta que te retratases aún más.\nQué grande el excoletas por haber retratado a toda la escoria fascista, aplastapobres y vendepatrias de este país. Todavía se sabe que escuece viendo que tienen a bastardos malpagados defendiendo lo indefendible por doquier. Son tan tiernos.\nAdemás de mentiroso es que es subnormal: la figura del licenciado hace años que no existe. En todo caso sería graduado. Es más, lo pone en la banda.\nEstá claro que se hizo la foto de graduación con créditos pendientes y ahora va de que ha terminado la carrera.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Estamos delante del nuevo alfa español, una serie de seres supremos que tienen tanta poca imaginación que copian un símbolo como el de la mascara de Guy Fawkes. Incapaces de decir una verdad, usan los miles de bots repartidos en varios continentes para que les den la razón, creando mierda y odio allá por donde van.\nBueno, quizás haya acabado las asignaturas que le acababan en Mayo o Junio...\nLa prueba que dice la chavala resentida esta de que está matriculada con ella no me parece que signifique mucho a estas alturas del año.\nQue el colegio le pida cuentas a él por decir que es Periodista sin serlo, si es que es así.\nPero no sé porque tanto revuelo, la verdad, es periodismo, ni que fuese una carrera de ciencias.\n[#4](c4#c-4) bueno, pero eso también aplica a muchos de los que a día de hoy ya tienen el titulo. Incluso a muchos que llevan décadas con el titulo\n[#10](c10#c-10) además, esa afirmación la dijo Pablo Iglesias sí, pero estando soltero, sin hijos, sin mercenarios de la derecha amenazando a su familia.\nComo mínimo, una persona de \"bien\" con un mínimo de razonamiento, se daría cuenta que una afirmación así estando soltero, no se puede mantener cuando estas en pareja, o formando una familia, porque esa decisión ya no es sólo tuya.\nPor lo tanto, solo un necio puede llamar hipócrita a Pablo Iglesias por no seguir viviendo en Vallecas.",
