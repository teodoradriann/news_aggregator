    "text": "Gli italiani in campo oggi al Roland Garros: Arnaldi contro Rublev. Orari e dove vederli in tv Parigi, 31 maggio 2024 - C&#039;è giusto il tempo di dormirci sopra per Matteo Arnaldi che il giorno dopo la vittoria contro Alexandre Muller deve tornare in campo per il quarto turno del Roland Garros. Ad attendere il tennista sanremese c&#039;è Andrey Rublev, numero 6 del ranking che aveva battuto lo spagnolo Pedro Martinez. Oltre al sanremese in campo anche Jannik Sinner contro Pavel Kotov. Il classe 2001, che al primo turno aveva battuto Fils, ha iniziato il match contro l&#039;altro transalpino Muller nella giornata di mercoledì, ma causa pioggia è stato interrotto durante il primo set sul 5-3 per l&#039;azzurro (vantaggio Muller nel game). La sfida è ripresa ieri, con Arnaldi che è stato bravo a non permettere all&#039;avversario di prendere fiducia, restando concentrato anche dopo il secondo stop forzato dal maltempo. Nel secondo dilaga e si porta avanti di due set, ma all’inizio del terzo la musica sembra cambiata, tanto che il padrone di casa va sul 2-0 e si procura la palla del doppio break. Qui è fondamentale la pioggia, che porta inevitabilmente a un&#039;altra sospensione. Al rientro, tre ace di fila dell&#039;azzurro che salvano il game, seguiti da un super controbreak che lo porta sul 5-2. Il ligure manca due match point in risposta e poi chiude al servizio. Vittoria che gli permette di fare due su due contro i francesi: prima Fils e ora Muller. L&#039;azzurro affronterà Andrey Rublev che ha battuto in tre set contro lo spagnolo Pedro Martinez in due ore esatte di gioco col parziale di 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, con l&#039;obiettivo di centrare quella che sarebbe la terza vittoria in undici partite contro top 10. Il match si giocherà sul campo Suzanne-Lenglen e sarà il secondo dalle ore 11, dopo quello tra la Samsonova ed Elisabetta Cocciaretto, dunque i due non saranno in campo prima delle ore 12:30 (sempre pioggia permettendo). Dove vedere il Roland Garros in tv La sfida del quarto turno tra Arnaldi e Rublev, così come tutte le partite del Roland Garros 2024, sarà trasmessa dai canali Eurosport.

    "text": "...if these things are true, the church got a midweek windfall of about Shs3.5m and the bereaved family (which was feeding a huge gathering for days) was short-changed. There is something about Uganda that has been more or less normalised. It is the death of plain honesty. Powerful political leaders, senior government officials, business people, different professionals and academic administrators now very often thrive on methodical dishonesty like ordinary crooks and go scot-free. Sometimes they even get glorified. Those citizens who worry about Uganda sometimes put their hope in the sermons of our religious leaders. But about two weeks ago, a friend with whom we were schoolmates passed on. A special afternoon funeral service was held at a Church of Uganda outfit not far from Makerere University, and not far from the home of the deceased. Hundreds of people attended, and a handsome cash collection was made. According to a minor official at the church, the (written or unwritten) practice in the Church of Uganda is to announce the amount collected, to retain 10 percent and pass on the bulk of the money to the bereaved family. However, whispers claimed that about Shs4m was collected, but no figure was announced. Secondly, Shs500,000 was given to the bereaved family. If these things are true, the church got a midweek windfall of about Shs3.5m, and the bereaved family (which was feeding a huge gathering for days) was short-changed. Why so many Ugandans expect – and even demand – free meals at funeral gatherings is for another day. When in close proximity with death, mortals are perhaps least inclined to resist the manipulative power or question the basic honesty of their priests. I am reminded of another funeral I had attended in the Matugga area on Bombo Road just over a year ago. A Church of Uganda clergyman had just finished the normal sepulchral routine. The departed old lady had been returned to the mineral state where dust and ashes belong, and the mourners were beginning to make the sombre journey from the graveyard. Completely novel to me, the presiding priest had hurriedly left the graveyard and set up a mini neo-evangelical performance in the compound. Imitating Pentecostal pastors, the priest was blowing his trumpet, exalting himself as a superior spiritual person. He intimidated non-Christians and challenged moderate and lukewarm Christians to declare that they had become (saved) fanatics there and then.A number of hands went up. But most astonishing, the priest now cunningly started an open-air session of blessings-for-cash! Death from the graveyard was brandishing his teeth and roaming about, perhaps contemplating the order of future victims in his grim enterprise. To many ordinary mourners, the man of God was standing between damnation in hell and the beauty of heaven after death. This was their moment, a great opportunity. Moreover, the priest was also asking each supplicant to name their most urgent earthly desire, which he assured them would soon be realised as he laid his hand on their heads, one after another. The queue was long, and the money accumulating in an empty mineral water carton. Greed was dancing in his eyes, his voice impatient, and the blessings blatantly superficial. Ugandans are used to a corrupt political elite that has organised their country into a vampire state. They are also accustomed to the comically ballooned and sometimes weirdly tragic pretences of many of our pastors and witchdoctors in the pursuit of wealth and status. As Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba gets distracted in different battles, he may not realise that his Church could little-by-little slide from episcopal control and creep into the generalised mess of a dishonest society, further puncturing the myth that religion is the mother of integrity.

    "text": "Provinces\nL’année scolaire 2024-2025 se referme dans la douleur pour de nombreuses écoles du Nord-Kivu, en particulier dans les entités sous occupation du M23, comme Goma et ses environs. Entre insécurité persistante, déplacements de populations et crise économique, la fin d’année est marquée par une désorganisation généralisée du système éducatif.\nSelon plusieurs experts du secteur, certaines écoles ont enregistré un taux de déperdition de 30 à 50 %, en raison du déplacement massif des parents et de la précarité ambiante. À Goma, Bukavu et dans d’autres entités affectées, enseignants comme élèves ont peiné à maintenir le cap.\n« Les enfants traversent des conditions sociales très difficiles. Le stress affecte leur performance scolaire », témoigne Théo Ciraba, responsable d’une école privée.\nLes écoles privées ne sont pas épargnées. Beaucoup d’entre elles font face à des impayés massifs de frais scolaires, compromettant leur fonctionnement. Dans le secteur public, les grèves à répétition, le non-paiement des enseignants et l’insécurité n’ont pas permis de mener à bien le programme national.\nClôture décalée, espoir à reconstruire\nDans ce contexte, le calendrier scolaire a été réaménagé. Les écoles publiques des zones occupées clôtureront l’année le 5 août, tandis que les établissements privés et adventistes mettront fin aux cours dès le 12 juillet.\nAu-delà des chiffres, cette situation met en lumière l’urgence d’un plan de résilience éducative en temps de crise. Car là où l’école vacille, c’est aussi l’avenir de toute une génération qui tremble.\nLe code à 7 caractères (précédé de « @ ») à côté du Nom est le Code MediaCongo de l’utilisateur.

    "text": "A new report is calling for increased funding for women’s health research, highlighting the critical need to address the ⁢ gender gap ⁤in medical advancements. The report emphasizes the importance of‌ investing in research that specifically focuses on women’s⁤ unique health needs and experiences.\n“Women’s health research has historically been underfunded, leading to a lack of understanding of many conditions that disproportionately affect women,” the report states. “This‌ disparity in research funding has real-world consequences, as it​ can result in delayed diagnoses, ineffective treatments, and ‌poorer health outcomes for women.”\nThe report comes at a time when ther is growing recognition ​of the importance of sex and gender considerations in medical research. Several initiatives are underway⁤ to ‌promote greater diversity and inclusion in clinical trials, ensuring that research⁤ findings are applicable to a wider range of individuals.\nOne such initiative is the development of new technologies and ⁣clinical trial ⁤designs that ⁤are specifically tailored to the needs of⁣ women. For example,researchers are ⁢exploring the use of wearable devices to track⁢ menstrual ⁤cycles and other health indicators,which could provide valuable insights into women’s health.\n“We need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine and recognize that women have ⁣unique health needs,” said ​Dr. Jane Doe, a leading researcher in women’s health. ⁤”By‍ investing in research that is specifically focused on women, we can develop⁣ more effective ⁢treatments and improve the health and well-being of ⁣women everywhere.”\nThe report’s authors urge policymakers, research institutions, and private funders to prioritize women’s health research and allocate the necessary resources to close the funding gap. They also ⁤call for increased collaboration between researchers, ⁣clinicians, and patient advocates⁢ to ensure that research‌ is⁢ relevant and responsive to⁤ the needs of women.\nThe push for greater investment in women’s health research is gaining momentum, with growing awareness of the ‌need to address⁤ the gender ⁣disparities in healthcare.⁤ By ​prioritizing women’s health, we can create a ⁢healthier future⁢ for all.\nA new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is calling for‌ a notable shift in how the United States approaches women’s health research. The report urges the National Institutes of‍ Health⁢ (NIH) to establish a dedicated institute focused solely on women’s health‌ and​ advocates for increased congressional funding to⁣ support this crucial area of study.\nThe report highlights the ‌persistent underrepresentation of women‌ in clinical trials,a critical factor hindering the development of effective treatments and therapies tailored to their unique biological needs. “A long-term commitment is needed for‌ more inclusive clinical trials,” the American Medical Association emphasized in a related statement.\nThe ⁤proposed​ institute would serve as⁢ a central​ hub for coordinating and advancing research on a⁣ wide range of women’s health issues, from reproductive health and menopause​ to chronic diseases and aging. By consolidating expertise and resources, the institute aims to accelerate the pace of finding and improve the health ​outcomes for women ​across the lifespan.\nThe report’s authors stress ⁤the urgency of addressing this issue, noting that women often experience‌ health conditions differently than men and may respond differently to treatments. “Failing to adequately study women’s health has profound ‌consequences for their well-being and can lead to disparities in healthcare,” the report‍ states.\nthe call for a dedicated institute and ⁢increased funding⁤ reflects a growing recognition of⁣ the need to prioritize‍ women’s health‍ research. Advocates⁣ hope that this ‍report will serve as a‌ catalyst for⁤ meaningful change, leading to a future where medical advancements are truly inclusive and responsive to the‌ needs of all.\n## ignoring ‌Half the​ Population: An Interview on Closing the Gender Gap in Medical ⁢Research\n**world-Today-News:** Dr.Jane Doe, thanks for ​joining us ⁢today to discuss this‌ vital report highlighting the urgent need ⁤for increased funding in​ women’s health research.\n**Dr. Jane Doe:** It’s ‌a pleasure to be here. This issue is critical and I’m grateful for the opportunity to raise‍ awareness.\n**World-Today-News:** The report⁢ paints a concerning picture of underfunding in​ women’s health ​research. Could you elaborate on the consequences⁤ of ⁢this disparity?\n**Dr. Jane‍ Doe:**⁢ Absolutely. For decades, women’s ⁣health ⁤has been treated as an afterthought ⁣in medical ⁢research. This means we⁣ have a limited understanding of diseases that disproportionately affect women, like endometriosis,‍ autoimmune ‍disorders, and certain types of heart disease. this lack of knowledge results in delayed diagnoses, ineffective treatments, and ultimately, poorer health outcomes for women.\n**World-Today-News:**⁤ The report mentions initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in clinical‌ trials. Can you tell us more about‌ thes efforts and their‌ importance?\n**Dr. Jane⁣ Doe:** It’s encouraging to see​ a growing recognition of the‌ need for more diverse portrayal in research. For too long, clinical trials have primarily focused on male participants, meaning ⁣the resulting treatments and therapies aren’t necessarily effective or safe⁢ for women. Initiatives promoting inclusivity ensure that research findings are relevant and beneficial to a broader population.\n**World-Today-News:** The report highlights promising advancements ‌like wearable technology ​being ⁣adapted⁤ to track⁢ menstrual ⁤cycles and other health indicators in women.how ⁤does this kind of innovation contribute to closing the research gap?\n**Dr. Jane Doe:** ⁣These ‌technological advancements are incredibly critically ⁤important. they allow us to collect data on women’s bodies in⁢ real-time​ and gain a deeper understanding of ⁤their unique physiological responses.⁤ This level of ‌personalization in data collection is essential for developing ⁣targeted treatments​ and interventions specifically tailored to women’s needs.\n**World-today-News:** What message do you have for‌ policymakers and potential funders​ regarding the importance‌ of investing in women’s health ‍research?\n**Dr.‌ Jane Doe:** Investing ​in women’s health research isn’t just about ⁢doing right by women. It’s about investing in ‍the well-being⁤ of half the population. This⁣ is not only an ethical ⁤imperative, but an economic one as well. when women are healthy, ⁤families thrive, and societies prosper. We need⁢ to prioritize funding for research that addresses the unique⁣ challenges⁤ women ⁣face ‍and unlocks ​their full potential.\n**World-Today-news:** ‍Dr. Doe, thank you for ⁢shedding light on ‌this crucial ⁣issue. We hope your ​insights‍ will contribute to a greater ‍understanding and ultimately lead to more equitable advancement in medical ⁢research.",
