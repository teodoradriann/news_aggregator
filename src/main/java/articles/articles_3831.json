    "text": "For the third week in a row, some 3,000 workers at daycares in Quebec are expected go on strike for a few hours this Friday.\nThe workers are members of the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ) affiliated Fédération des intervenantes en petite enfance (FIPEQ).\nThe CPEs affected are expected to open their doors at 10 a.m., with their strike mandate allowing them to open later and later each Friday.\nNext week, doors will open at 12 p.m. if no progress is made.\nThe main points in the dispute are wages, workload and organization.\nA qualified educator in an early childhood centre earns $21.60 an hour at the first echelon and $28.60 at the tenth echelon.\nThe unions representing workers in the CPEs argue they only received a wage increase offer of 12.7 per cent over five years from Quebec City, whereas other government employees were given 17.4 per cent over five years.\nThe Treasury Board points out that \"the 17.4 per cent increase granted to the Common Front was based on quid pro quos in terms of flexibility in work organization, which have a real impact on services.\"\nThere is currently a shortage of childcare workers, with Quebec seeking to attract people to the field by opening thousands of spaces.\nThe FIPEQ, affiliated to the CSQ, also represents 9,000 educational childcare providers who work in family daycares.\nThey are opening later and later every day of the week.\nNegotiations, which began in the spring, are continuing.\n-- This report by The Canadian Press was first published in French on Nov. 29, 2024.",

    "title": "The DOJ Demands That Google Cease Innovating",
    "text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) is presently demanding that Google sell Chrome, the world’s most popular internet browser. Oh wow, not again…\nTraveling back in time, as late as 2002 Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) could claim 94 percent of the web browser market. Which was the problem, albeit not for consumers, but for Microsoft. Just as Google’s innovative, market-beating ways are attracting the attention of antitrust ankle-biters in the present, so did they for Microsoft in the past.\nThe simple truth is that the DOJ is always on the warpath against businesses possessing the temerity to not just meet the needs of consumers, but lead them. For providing consumers with much more than they ever imagined they wanted, Microsoft’s reward was a demand from the DOJ that it separate IE from the Windows software packages it was selling to highly-eager consumers.\nConsider for a moment the time in which this odd decree came down: the late 1990s when internet use was soaring, and when the people (a.k.a. the marketplace ) had overwhelmingly chosen IE as their preferred path onto an internet that they couldn’t get enough of. The DOJ’s decree was the equivalent of federal bureaucrats demanding that GM sell its cars without an engine inside.\nIf as you’re reading this you’re puzzled by the then and now of the DOJ’s actions, rest assured that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was too. As Gates asked in frustration amid the attacks on his company, “Are we allowed to continue to innovate in products, and in Windows itself?”\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Google’s executives and shareholders must be wondering the same. Fully aware that they’re competing in the most competitive of competitive business sectors (see the valuations of Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and other technology companies if you’re confused), Google executives and employees get up every day aggressively in search of ways to remain relevant and essential in a marketplace well-populated by Google’s would-be replacements, yet they’re now being told that if they succeed in meeting and leading the needs of consumers, their reward will be lawsuits from the DOJ demanding that they sell the assets that have brought the company so much popularity in the first place.\nSeriously, why innovate if you’ll be forced to sell what you’ve created at a discount? To which some might be asking what’s meant by discount. The answer is very simple: no buyer of Chrome would pay full price assuming a sale of it by Google in light of market knowledge that the sale would be coerced.\nAll of which raises another point, followed by a question. It was the genius within Google that made Chrome so valuable, get it? To then pretend that Chrome would still be Chrome if not owned by Google insults common sense. Lest we forget, it was once again the genius within Google that made its browser so popular, at which point the DOJ is going to force a sale to those Google and Chrome beat in the marketplace?\nWhat makes the DOJ’s actions comical, sad, and pointless at the same time concerns a bit of news from yesterday. It turns out OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is considering releasing its own web browser. Will it succeed, as in will it vanquish Chrome?\nWithout knowing the answer to the above, it’s easy to say that a competition between Chrome and OpenAI would almost certainly redound to the consumer, which is the point of markets in the first place. Let’s just hope it happens. Seriously, could you blame OpenAI for passing on the competition with full knowledge of what happened to the last two web browser champions?",
