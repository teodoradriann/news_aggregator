    "title": "600 gather at Batu Caves for fuss-free show of devotion",
    "text": "Some of the Hindu devotees who gathered at Batu Caves for a peaceful response to a recent video by a Moroccan social influencer. PETALING JAYA: Some 600 Hindus congregated at Batu Caves today for a devotional gathering in response to foreign social media influencers accused of insulting the faith. In a statement, Swashna Subramaniam, who led the singing of the religious song, said the gathering was held to show that prayers could be “done in a peaceful manner without courting controversies.” The event was co-organised by Rajeswary Apahu and volunteers from Hindu Volunteers Movement. Some of those at the gathering came all the way from Kedah and Singapore, according to S Shashi Kumar, who heads the Global Human Rights Federation, a local NGO. Shashi had recently criticised a Moroccan YouTuber who courted controversy with a video of him reciting Quranic verses at Batu Caves, in front of a Hindu idol. There must be mutual respect at all places of worship. “Only then, we can live in peace and harmony,” he said in a statement. The Moroccan content creator, Abdellatif Ouisa, has since apologised, saying he thought Batu Caves was a historic site rather than a religious one. He said he did not know the 42m-tall statue was of the Hindu deity Lord Murugan. However, Abdellatif’s apology was described as “lame and unacceptable” by Shashi. Shashi said there had been two other cases where foreigners recited Quranic verses at Batu Caves, attacking non-Muslims.",

    "text": "Con una visión renovada de responsabilidad social, Scotiabank Colpatria, liderado por Jabar Singh, contribuye al bienestar social mediante su plataforma global de voluntariado, Spark. Esta herramienta no solo conecta a los empleados con oportunidades de voluntariado y donación, sino que también redefine la manera en que las empresas integran la sostenibilidad y el impacto social en sus operaciones.\nEn 2024, Spark alcanzó cifras en Colombia, cerca de 30.000 horas de voluntariado registradas, más de $1.068 millones en contribuciones y cientos de organizaciones beneficiadas. Con una red global que incluye más de dos millones de entidades benéficas .\nLo innovador de Spark radica en su modelo de recompensas. Por cada hora de voluntariado aprobada, los empleados reciben US$12 que se transforman en donaciones para las organizaciones de su elección. Este esquema no solo motiva a los colaboradores a ser agentes activos del cambio, sino que también asegura un flujo constante de recursos para las iniciativas sociales.\nLas actividades lideradas por Spark van desde la siembra de árboles y el cuidado animal hasta la construcción de viviendas y la readecuación de espacios escolares. Estos esfuerzos no solo generan un impacto visible en las comunidades, sino que también fomentan la cohesión entre los colaboradores, quienes aportan tiempo, energía y recursos a causas que resuenan con sus valores.\n“La meta es clara: aumentar los recursos en recompensas por horas de voluntariado y beneficiar aún más a las organizaciones que apoyamos ”, afirmó Singh.",

(KNOE) - Residents and institutions in South Monroe are recovering after a severe storm Tuesday left homes damaged and power out across the region, with Richwood bearing the brunt.\nAt Greater Free Gift Baptist Church, Bishop Rodney McFarland reported significant damage to both the interior and exterior of the building.\n“As you’ve seen, there is quite a bit of damage inside, and still more we haven’t assessed due to the power outage,” McFarland said. “We’re now trying to reach a roofing company to tarp the holes.”\nChurch events planned for later this week are postponed, but Sunday worship will take place at the Emily P. Robinson Recreation Center.\nSeveral schools, including Richwood Middle and High School, were closed due to outages. Residents also reported severe damage to homes.\n“The window started banging, everything came through the roof,” said Anna, a local resident. “I had to crawl to the bedroom and hide under a mattress. A tree fell through the kitchen—when I moved, the floor just gave out.”\nOfficials urge displaced residents to contact the Red Cross at 1-800-RED-CROSS for shelter and assistance.",
