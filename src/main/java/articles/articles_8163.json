    "title": "G20 hears a $250-billion-a-year idea: tax the super-rich - Briefly.co.za",
    "text": "French economist Gabriel Zucman brought a $250-billion-a-year idea to top policy makers from the world's biggest economies Thursday: slap an international wealth tax on the super-rich. Zucman, a 37-year-old ex-protege of renowned economist and inequality expert Thomas Piketty, was invited to outline his research on tax evasion by the ultra-wealthy at a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations, which is working to address the issue. In an interview with AFP on the sidelines of the gathering in Sao Paulo, the UC Berkeley and Paris School of Economics professor discussed how billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos get away with paying zero income tax, how to change that, and why world leaders need to do it fast to save democracy. What is argument for minimum tax on super-rich? \"There is a growing body of evidence that today's tax systems, instead of being progressive, tend to be sharply regressive at the top of the distribution... The explosion of extreme wealth is one of the defining features of the world economy . It's really in our face. And the fact that these people (billionaires) pay very little in tax has become more and more obvious over the years. \"One concrete proposal is billionaires should pay each year, in income tax, the equivalent of at least two percent of their wealth... Unlike income, wealth is very well-defined. \"There are about 3,000 US-dollar-billionaires globally... That would generate about $250 billion in additional tax revenue worldwide. \"According to the best estimates that we have, developing countries need an additional $500 billion to face the challenges of climate change. So we can get half of that with just this minimum tax on billionaires.\" What was the reaction at G20? \"Today is really the first time that there has been a discussion like this in a forum like the G20. And I was struck by the fact that many countries expressed support for the view that yes, we should have international agreements about taxing the super-rich, increasing tax progressivity, fighting inequality. I think it's a very positive development. \"It's the very beginning of the conversation. There has to be an inclusive discussion and more studies to flesh out the details.\" Billionaires will hate it. What's your message to them? \"It's good if they hate it. Because it shows that this will actually make a difference. This is actually the one tax that's going to be very hard for them to avoid. The income tax is very easy to avoid. The inheritance or estate tax, they're also very good at avoiding it. This is something that will be very hard for them to avoid. So yes, they're going to fight. \"But I think what I fear more is the consequences of inaction. I think it is much more risky to continue (the current trend) of rising concentration of wealth, of tax injustice. \"The inequalities we have today... are unlikely to be very sustainable. They are corrosive for democracy.\" Source: AFP",

    "text": "Mymensingh, Bangladesh – Kicked out of other prayer services, members of Bangladesh’s transgender hijra community have been welcomed at a new mosque in the Muslim-majority nation with the promise of worship without discrimination.\nThe humble structure — a single-room shed with walls and a roof clad in tin — is a new community hub for the minority, who have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice.\n“From now on, no one can deny a hijra from praying in our mosque,” community leader Joyita Tonu said in a speech to the packed congregation.\n“No one can mock us,” added the visibly emotional 28-year-old, a white scarf covering her hair.\nThe mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, was built on land donated by the government after the city’s hijra community were expelled from an established congregation.\n“I never dreamt I could pray at a mosque again in my lifetime,” said Sonia, 42, who as a child loved to recite the Koran and studied at an Islamic seminary.\nBut when she came out as hijra, as transgender women in South Asia are commonly known, she was blocked from praying in a mosque.\n“People would tell us: ‘Why are you hijra people here at the mosques? You should pray at home. Don’t come to the mosques,'” Sonia, who uses only one name, told AFP.\n“It was shameful for us, so we didn’t go,” she added. “Now, this is our mosque. Now, no one can say no.”\n– ‘Like any other people’ –\nHijra have been the beneficiaries of growing legal recognition in Bangladesh, which since 2013 has officially allowed members of the community to identify as a third gender.\nSeveral have entered Bangladeshi politics, with one transgender woman elected mayor of a rural town in 2021.\nBut hijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights.\nThey are also often discriminated against in employment and are much more likely to be victims of violent crime and poverty than the average Bangladeshi.\nHardline Islamist groups have also lashed out at the recognition of transgender Bangladeshis in school textbooks, leading rallies to demand the government abandon its push to include them in the curriculum.\nMufti Abdur Rahman Azad, founder of a hijra charity, told AFP that the new mosque was the first of its kind in the country.\nA similar endeavour planned in another city was stopped last month after a protest by locals, he added.\nDozens of local hijra women donated time and money to build the Dakshin Char Kalibari Masjid for the Third Gender, which opened this month.\nIt also has a graveyard, after a local Muslim cemetery last year refused to bury a young hijra woman inside its grounds.\nThe mosque’s imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith.\n“They are like any other people created by Allah”, the cleric told AFP.\n– ‘No one can be denied’ –\n“We all are human beings. Maybe some are men, some are women, but all are human. Allah revealed the Holy Koran for all, so everyone has the right to pray, no one can be denied.”\nMotaleb said that other Bangladeshis could learn from the faith and strength of the hijra.\n“Since I have been here at this mosque, I have been impressed by their character and deeds,” he said.\nThe new mosque is already tackling prejudice. Local resident Tofazzal Hossain, 53, has offered Friday prayers there for a second week in a row.\nHe said living and praying with the hijra community has changed his “misconceptions” about them.\n“When they started to live with us, many people said many things,” he told AFP.\n“But we’ve realised what people say isn’t right. They live righteously like other Muslims”.\nTonu hopes to expand the simple mosque to be big enough to cater for more people.\n“God willing, we will do it very soon,” she told AFP.\n“Hundreds of people can offer prayers together.”",

    "text": "\"Assez longtemps dans le déni\" : Michèle Bernier fait des confidences bouleversantes sur sa dépression\nMichèle Bernier compte parmi les comédiennes françaises les plus populaires. Le public l'apprécie notamment pour sa simplicité et sa spontanéité. Ce mercredi 23 avril 2025, c'est en toute transparence qu'elle a levé le voile sur une période difficile de sa vie auprès de nos confrères de Télé-Loisirs.\nC'est dans le Théâtre de Bouvard que Michèle Bernier s'est fait connaître. Depuis, la fille du Professeur Choron multiplie les projets au théâtre, à la télévision et au cinéma. Elle est aussi passée par la case animation, mais c'est bien dans la fiction qu'elle se sent le mieux. La comédienne donne alors vie à des personnages différents, mais souvent touchants. La preuve avec la série télévisée La stagiaire, diffusée sur France 3. La fin du programme ne semble pas être pour tout de suite : il y aura bien une saison 10.\nQuand elle n'est pas au travail, Michèle Bernier est une femme dévouée à sa famille. La comédienne a eu la chance de devenir maman deux fois, en 1987 puis en 1997. Ses deux enfants, Charlotte et Enzo Gaccio, la comblent d'amour au quotidien. Elle a même transmis sa passion à sa fille, avec qui elle pourrait partager un étonnant projet. Par ailleurs, Charlotte lui a permis de (...)",

    "text": "New Delhi: Ahead of the scheduled inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya next month, slogans demanding the rebuilding of the Babri Masjid have surfaced on the walls of the Language Study Centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Students on Wednesday night saw these slogans on the campus, and photos of the graffiti were widely shared on social media on Thursday. The slogans were found above the name of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI), the Congress's student wing.However, the NSUI distanced itself from the controversy. Sudhanshu Shekhar, the president of NSUI's JNU unit, pointed out that the organization's name was already present in black marker, and the slogans were added later in red marker. Shekhar alleged that this was an attempt to tarnish NSUI's image and called for stringent action from the JNU administration.JNU's chief security officer, Naveen Yadav, claimed to be unaware of the incident. He mentioned that slogans targeting a specific caste had been written a few months ago, but no investigation had taken place. There was no immediate response from the JNU vice-chancellor and the registrar.Previous incidents at JNU include anti-Brahmin slogans like 'There will be blood' painted on the walls of the School of Languages and School of International Studies last December, and messages related to Kashmir found two months ago. Satish Garkoti, rector of JNU, had mentioned a committee's formation to look into repeated incidents of \"anti-national\" slogans on the campus and the installation of CCTVs in strategic locations.The revised Chief Proctor Office manual has a provision for a fine of Rs 10,000 for writing controversial slogans. However, the Language Study Centre does not have CCTV coverage to check the defacement of walls.",

    "title": "Monte Fuji, no Japão, atravessa período recorde sem neve",
    "text": "O Monte Fuji, um dos cartões-postais mais conhecidos do Japão, atravessa o período mais longo sem precipitações de neve em seu cume desde o início dos registros, há 130 anos. A cobertura de neve na montanha mais alta do Japão começa normalmente em torno de 2 de outubro. No ano passado, a primeira neve surgiu no dia 5 do mesmo mês. Yutaka Katsuta, do Escritório Local de Meteorologia de Kofu, explicou que a falta de neve no vulcão inativo ocorre devido ao tempo excepcionalmente quente, o que acarretou a quebra do recorde anterior, observado nos dias 26 de outubro de 1995 e 2016. “As temperaturas estiveram altas no verão, e continuaram altas em setembro, bloqueando o ar frio” que causa a neve, disse Katsuta. O meteorologista afirmou que as mudanças climáticas podem ter certo grau de impacto no atraso da formação da cobertura de neve. Temperaturas recorde O verão deste ano no Japão foi o mais quente já registrado, igualando o nível de 2023, enquanto as ondas de calor impulsionadas pelas mudanças climáticas afetaram o clima em diferentes partes do globo. O país chegou a registrar até 40º C nos dias de calor mais extremos entre junho e agosto, atingindo uma média que supera em quase 2º C os registros de anos anteriores. As temperaturas em setembro também foram mais altas do que o habitual, com cerca de 1.500 regiões do país registrando dias considerados “extremamente quentes”, com mais de 35º C. O calor refreou ligeiramente em outubro, embora as temperaturas ainda estejam acima da média. Entre terça e quarta-feira (30/10), foram observadas nuvens ao redor do Monte Fuji com possibilidade de precipitações, embora as temperaturas de cerca de 3º C no cume impeçam que elas ocorram na forma de neve. As previsões sugerem possíveis precipitações de neve no dia 31 ou em 1º de novembro. Turismo excessivo O Monte Fuji é coberto de neve durante a maior parte do ano. Durante a temporada de montanhismo, entre julho e setembro – período que inclui o verão no país –, mais de 200.000 visitantes costumam se aventurar nas encostas íngremes e rochosas. Muitos escalam o Monte Fuji durante a noite para ver o nascer do sol em seu cume, a uma altura de 3.776 metros. Este ano, um número menor montanhistas tentou a escalada, após o governo japonês introduzir uma taxa de entrada e limitar a quantidade de pessoas para combater o turismo excessivo. O formato simétrico da montanha foi imortalizado em incontáveis obras de arte, incluindo a famosa Grande Onda do artista japonês Hokusai. A última erupção no Monte Fuji ocorreu há cerca de 300 anos.",

In the letter, Owaisi has expressing his concerns regarding the demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid at Central Secretariat, days after the urban body issued a public notice seeking Delhi residents’ suggestions or objections on the matter until January 1. Owaisi stressed the historical and architectural importance of Sunehri Masjid, and said its removal would constitute an ‘irredeemable loss to India’s heritage’. “It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the council thinks that a mosque that has been there for nearly past 200 years is an ‘obstruction.’ It is also unfortunate that the council has ignored its own duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,” he wrote. By choosing to remove a heritage site that is also a place of worship, the NDMC is violating the right of freedom of religion of Muslims under Article 25, he said. “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right… It also violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture,” he added. Owaisi further accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of showing hostility towards Muslims, mosques, and the Azaan.",

    "text": "This sequence of photos shows an AmeriGuard employee demonstrating the HydroGuard by walking underneath, and ultimately running away once sprayed with a jet of water. Photo by Frank Lopez Written by [Frank Lopez](https://thebusinessjournal.com/byline/frank-lopez/) The owner of a national security company based in the Central Valley is offering a possible solution to help combat issues with tagging on buildings. Fresno-based AmeriGuard Security revealed a new product to try and help businesses and municipalities prevent damage on their buildings, as well as blight caused by homeless people. HydroGuard, which is currently going through the patent process, is a motion-sensor water spraying system that is activated when someone stands near the outer walls of a building. It can also be activated manually, as well through an autonomous artificial intelligence system that can differentiate between a dog walking by — or a person. The HydroGuard system can also be activated for a certain timeframe, such as after store closing hours, and the water can be set to spray as a deterrent for any increment of time. It can also be controlled through cellphone apps. Lawrence Garcia, president and CEO of AmeriGuard, said that the water would deter vandals, as well as homeless people, from loitering against outer walls. It leaves the ground wet, making it less desirable for individuals to place their belongings on the ground. “I feel this is a humane approach to get people to get away from the business and to take their activities somewhere else,” Garcia said. Garcia said he currently has the HydroGuard system set up at a local restaurant and a furniture store. The system also has a speaker sound that can be set up to project a pre-recorded message, live voice or any sound, such as thunder, he said. HydroGuard can be connected to a building’s AC and swamp cooler, and can also be powered by solar panels. Garcia said Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer has expressed interest in using the HydroGuard for city buildings. A city representative recently came out to see the system in action. He said that the California High Speed Rail Authority, whom AmeriGuard provides security for, likes HydroGuard, but is lacking a water source or the system. Garcia expects other businesses and municipalities to take interest in the product. “It’s going to be licensable, and I think other states and cities would like to try it. We can roll it out to Anytown U.S.A.,” Garcia said. He said the cost will depend on whether a building has a power and water source, but is trying to keep the costs as low as possible. HydroGuard isn’t a product he needs to sell at a high profit margin, but one that will see great returns when large quantities are sold. “What I’m trying to do is cover my costs, enough to just display it, get the City of Fresno to fall in love with it, and then get it out to other towns,” Garcia said. HydroGuard has a control valve sensor that can detect if there are water leaks or if it’s releasing more water than it’s supposed to, and notifies the owner. Big bids Along with expanding its arsenal of security services, AmeriGuard recently expanded a new contract with its non-emergency medical transportation service for veterans, TransportUS. As a veteran himself, Garcia noticed that many veterans have various medical issues and appointments, with many of them having no family members or friends to transport them. “It’s a growing need, and there’s a coming ‘silver tsunami’ in this industry, and we are happy to be involved,” Garcia said. In about the last four months, Garcia said TransportUS has gotten three new contracts in the Long Beach area, and is close to securing a contract in San Diego. TransportUS performs about 430 transports in a span of 24 hours with about 120 of their own vehicles. Just recently, TransporUS secured a contract with the Loma Linda University Health. Garcia said TransportUS was started six years ago and has grown very quickly, and he expects that growth to continue. [.](javascript:void(0);) [.](javascript:void(0);) [.](javascript:void(0);)",
