This is the beginning.” Confident [Patrick Mahomes](http://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/patrick-mahomes//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3) said this after marching towards his locker room, donning a shiny Santa Claus-style coat on Christmas Day. It was a special win for the entire [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_5) community. But for Mahomes’s family, it was extra special for sure!\nWhen it comes to the quarterback’s family, we cannot forget the proud mother of Patrick Mahomes. Momma Randi Mahomes recently shared a Christmas update with her fans, revealing how the holiday went for her. So, how was it?\n“Amazing Christmas Day with all my favorite people, FaceTime my daddy!!! And of course, Chiefs Win!!! #BLESSED.” The 53-year-old momma seemed to celebrate December 25 of this year very well. Indeed, it was great to see her ill dad on a video call, and wish him the best this Christmas. In addition, the big win of her quarterback son and his team surely was the cherry on the cake for her.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAmazing Christmas Day with all my favorite people, FaceTime my daddy!!! And of course Chiefs Win!!!\n[#BLESSED]— Randi Mahomes (@tootgail)\n[December 26, 2024]\nNo doubt, Randi Mahomes has been one of Patrick Mahomes’s biggest supporters. Continuing to show her support for the three-time Super Bowl champ, Randi, who is currently vacationing in New York, shared a picture carousel with her fans a day ago on Instagram. And guess what? In the very first picture, Momma Mahomes showcased the Amazon Prime NFL banner, which prominently featured the quarterback.\nNow that Patrick Mahomes and his Chiefs have improved 15-1 this season, it’s definitely a big day for the Chiefdom and the Mahomes family. But there was one other thing that was special that Christmas night.\nPatrick Mahomes left his wife Brittany emotional on December 25!\nThe Chiefs’s men probably didn’t sleep while returning from [Pittsburgh](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_1). As shown in multiple footage, the entire roster was elated with excitement on Christmas night. But [Brittany Mahomes](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/brittany-mahomes//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3) was probably more excited than others. Why? Well, the reason is, of course, her husband Patrick Mahomes, and his promise.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAfter the game, when a curious reporter asked Patrick Mahomes about how special this win was, Mahomes replied, “I told my pregnant wife I was going to get the number one seed so that we can have the baby.” Yes, Patrick confirmed that he earlier promised her to clinch seed #1, assuring Brittany about the Chiefs’s future and his performance. And of course, he did it. Hence, sharing the same quote on her official IG account, [the pregnant momma wrote](https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-active-news-pregnant-brittany-mahomes-sends-four-word-christmas-message-after-patrick-mahomes-fulfilled-one-seed-promise//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3), “Always keeping his promises (with emotional and white heart emojis).”\nWell, Patrick Mahomes is definitely the man of words!\nDebate",

    "text": "SAN FIORANO (Lodi)Nuove mosse, dell’amministrazione comunale di San Fiorano , contro il potenziale arrivo di nuovi pannelli agrifotovoltaici sui territori di San Fiorano, Corno Giovine e Santo Stefano Lodigiano: arrivano un documento da approvare in Consiglio comunale e una raccolta firme . A settembre privati hanno infatti presentato un’istanza, al ministero dell’Ambiente, per realizzare un impianto agrivoltaico avanzato nell’area tra Santo Stefano, San Fiorano, Maleo e Corno Giovine. Con richiesta, a dicembre, di fornire ulteriore documentazione. La potenza dichiarata è di 41 megawatt, e il progetto prevede anche il collegamento in antenna alla stazione elettrica “Maleo“ di Terna Spa. Sembra che i pannelli possano interessare soprattutto il territorio di San Fiorano e di Santo Stefano, con le opere connesse nel territorio di Corno Giovine e in parte di Maleo. Non è invece dichiarata la superficie interessata. \"La richiesta al Ministero di autorizzazione per sfruttare, ai fini dell’agrivoltaico, un’area grossa come 100 campi da calcio, mi vede fortemente contrario – ribadisce il sindaco Mario Ghidelli –. Sono pronto ad oppormi a tutti questi insediamenti. Qui già ne abbiamo uno, a 150 metri dal Comune lungo la strada bassa del paese, che da biogas diventerà a biometano e comporterà un incremento del traffico sul territorio\".Da qui le nuove mosse: \"Entro fine mese porteremo, in Consiglio comunale, un documento che ribadirà che non siamo d’accordo con questo tipo di impianto fotovoltaico, a meno di 100 metri dalle abitazioni, adiacente a un’area residenziale in via di sviluppo. Si rischia di provocare un grosso danno al Comune. Poi raccoglieremo le firme e inizieremo una battaglia vera e propria per dire no. Capisco che dobbiamo produrre energia elettrica, ma si dovrebbero usare capannoni. Inoltre i pannelli sarebbero vicini a una Madonnina, che è riconosciuta “punto di pellegrinaggio“ dalla Sacra Rota\". P.A.",

    "text": "By Clark Mindock\n(Reuters) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday finalized new regulations targeting pollution from power plants, including a landmark rule that requires sweeping reductions in carbon emissions from existing coal and new gas plants to combat climate change. The move is expected to usher in major legal challenges.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nWHAT DO THE RULES DO?\nThe EPA’s four rules require drastic cuts in carbon pollution from power plants and update long-standing measures to reduce mercury and toxic air pollutants, clean up wastewater and lessen coal ash discharges.\nThe power plant emissions rule mandates that many new gas and existing coal plants reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2032. That could require the U.S. power industry to install billions of dollars worth of emissions control technologies or shut down the dirtiest facilities operating today.\nThe agency says the most stringent reductions can be achieved through the installation of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology, which traps greenhouse gasses as they are released.\nThe EPA projects the emissions rule will cut 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047, which is equivalent to preventing the annual emissions from 328 million gas-powered cars.\nHOW HAVE COURTS RESPONDED TO EARLIER PLANT RESTRICTIONS?\nThe new carbon emissions regulations come nearly two years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a previous power plant emissions rule developed during the Obama administration, which sought to spur a shift from coal to cleaner energy sources.\nIn its 6-3 ruling in West Virginia v. EPA, the Supreme Court found that the Clean Air Act did not expressly authorize the EPA to require electricity generators to shift from fossil fuels to energy sources like wind or solar that emit less carbon dioxide.\nThe decision invoked the “major questions” legal doctrine, which requires regulatory agencies to possess explicit congressional authorization before they can take consequential actions on issues of far-reaching importance and societal impact.\nThe new plant emissions rule does not directly require a shift from fossil fuels. Legal experts say it attempts to hew closer to a more traditional reading of the agency’s power in the Clean Air Act by favoring technologies like carbon capture and sequestration that can be installed at the power plants themselves.\nHOW COULD LEGAL CLASHES OVER THE RULE SHAPE UP?\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey on Thursday promised to challenge the power plant emissions rule in court. Last year, Morrissey led a group of Republican attorneys general who complained that the rule sets “unrealistic” and expensive standards that go well beyond the EPA’s legal authority. The states said the rules would “kill jobs, raise energy prices, and hurt energy reliability.”\nU.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the top Republican on the Senate environment committee, separately said on Thursday she would introduce a resolution to overturn the rules.\nRepublican-led states and industry groups are likely to claim in any lawsuits that the emissions rule far surpasses the EPA’s legal authority, triggers the major questions doctrine and violates administrative law. The other pollution rules announced Thursday are also likely to be targeted in court.\nLegal experts say the EPA’s decision to trim the final carbon emissions rule compared to an earlier proposal – including by removing hydrogen as a “best system of emissions reduction,” and removing requirements for existing gas plants – may make the rule somewhat easier to defend but will not stop the coming courtroom blitz.\nBusiness and electric utility groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Edison Electric Institute have said the rule relies too heavily on carbon-quelling technologies that have not been deployed at scale and face significant regulatory hurdles.\nThey also argued that installing capture and sequestration systems would require building pipelines and emissions storage facilities outside the power plants themselves.\n(Reporting by Clark Mindock; Editing by David Bario and Daniel Wallis)",

(Augstein/REUTERS)\nFuente: Infobae\nEl príncipe Guillermo ha proseguido con sus compromisos este jueves 14 de marzo. Tras su reaparición del lunes durante la celebración del día de la Commonwealth, el primogénito del rey Carlos III ha visitado una organización juvenil y no ha dudado en referirse a su esposa, Kate Middleton , en medio del escándalo que la rodea por su misteriosa baja médica.\nGuillermo se mostró cercano y sonriente durante su visita al distrito londinense de Hammersmith y Fulham, donde ha podido recorrer las instalaciones de la OnSide Youth Zone. A su llegada, se le podía ver conversando relajadamente con Kevin McGranth, viceteniente de la zona.\nEn este espacio de encuentro juvenil, el príncipe pudo conocer a niños y jóvenes usuarios de la organización, con quienes jugó al pool, encestó unas canastas y cocinó galletas . Era en ese momento cuando se refería a su esposa, que sigue retirada de los compromisos públicos tras someterse a una cirugía abdominal.\n“ Mi esposa es la artística ”, comentó el hijo de Lady Di. Además, también mencionó a sus tres hijos, George, Charlotte y Louis: “Incluso mis hijos son más artísticos que yo”, expresaba, confesando que “a Louis le encantan las chispas” mientras las agregaba a la galleta que estaba decorando.\nSe trata de la primera vez que Guillermo menciona públicamente a Kate tras el escándalo desatado por su cirugía abdominal y las teorías de la conspiración que se han sucedido después de que la princesa publicara una fotografía manipulada.\nImagen de normalidad En medio del huracán mediático que rodea a su familia, el príncipe Guillermo ha ofrecido una imagen de completa normalidad y ha charlado con los jóvenes, con quienes ha reflexionado sobre el uso excesivo del móvil. “ Los mayores también somos culpables. (…) Tenemos que mejorar en eso. Pasamos años en nuestros”, ha expresado.\nEl príncipe Guillermo, durante su visita al distrito de Hammersmith y Fulham. (Frank Augstein/Pool via REUTERS)\nAl finalizar su visita, el heredero británico afirmaba estar encantado con la oportunidad de conocer de primera mano la zona juvenil. “ Lo que han hecho aquí es increíble ”, aseveró. Y agregaba: “Me gusta mucho el concepto, cumple todos los requisitos: es divertido, seguro, educativo… ¡Es fantástico!”.\nTras este amable compromiso, el príncipe vivirá en la noche de este jueves un tenso ‘reencuentro’ con su hermano Harry. Y es que ambos participarán en la ceremonia de entrega del Diana Legacy Award , aunque el príncipe lo hará de forma presencial, mientras que su hermano solo aparecerá en un vídeo. Sin embargo, la ruptura entre ambos es tal que todo ha sido organizado para que la pieza protagonizada por Harry solo se emita cuando Guillermo abandone el acto.\nDe esta manera, la ceremonia se ha organizado teniendo en cuenta el distanciamiento que hay entre ambos hermanos para que, ni siquiera de forma remota y virtual, se crucen. Un gesto que demuestra, una vez más, la complicada relación que hay entre los dos .",

    "text": " SUBSCRIBER ONLY College Sports | Hurricanes end year with one-score Pinstripe Bowl loss to Rutgers Miami Hurricanes quarterback Jacurri Brown slides for a touchdown in UM’s loss to Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium on Thursday. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) By gqlshare | gqlshare@digitalfirstmedia.com PUBLISHED: December 28, 2023 at 5:49 28, 2023 at 7:44 p.m. NEW YORK CITY — The Hurricanes’ run defense was stout for nearly the entire season, but with several players missing due to the NFL draft or departing via the transfer portal, the run defense faltered.\nRutgers racked up 208 yards on the ground and scored three rushing touchdowns as the Scarlet Knights (7-6) picked up a 31-24 win over Miami (7-6) in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. The Hurricanes have now lost their last five bowl appearances and 11 of their past 12.\n“We look at it with honesty, we look at it with reality: There’s so many good things that we have done throughout the season that show progress, and yet we find ourselves showing a lack of discipline in crunch time,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “A special teams blunder and a turnover on downs is a turnover. So those are things that you have to just attack collectively, as a group, as an organization. Coaches, players, everybody. There’s no pointing fingers in there. When you win, you win together. When you lose, you lose together.”\nMiami entered the game missing several key players. Starting quarterback Tyler Van Dyke and wide receiver Colbie Young transferred to Wisconsin and Georgia, respectively. Starting defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III, starting safeties Kam Kinchens and James Williams and starting offensive linemen Javion Cohen and Matt Lee all sat the game out as they prepared for the NFL draft.\nThe Hurricanes got off to a sluggish start on defense. Rutgers went up 14-0 to start the game, getting touchdowns on a goal-line run by quarterback Gavin Wimsatt and a 7-yard run by Kyle Monangai.\nMiami’s offense got out to a slow start, managing just 5 yards in the first quarter. But the Scarlet Knights aided the Hurricanes late in the first half, committing a pair of personal fouls to help UM get in the red zone. Jacurri Brown put the Hurricanes on the board with a 7-yard run and score, sliding into the end zone.\nThe Hurricanes got the ball back at their own 10-yard line with 40 seconds left, but instead of taking a knee to end the half down a score, they chose to try for points. The decision paid off, as they drove down the field and reached the Scarlet Knights’ 17-yard line. Miami nearly scored a game-tying touchdown on a catch by Xavier Restrepo, but a review ruled him out of bounds. The Hurricanes needed to settle for a field goal to end the second quarter.\nMiami jumped out to its one lead of the game on a 30-yard touchdown from Brown to Restrepo on their first drive of the second half, but their second ended in disaster. After the Scarlet Knights pinned the Hurricanes inside the 10 on a punt, they forced a three-and-out.\nRutgers’ Trevor Kodie-Yeboah blocked a Dylan Joyce punt in the end zone, and Timmy Ward recovered it for a Scarlet Knights go-ahead touchdown.\n“Obviously, a block and a touchdown at the same time is massive in terms of momentum,” Cristobal said.\nRutgers put the game away in the fourth quarter. Monangai, who finished the game with 163 yards, broke off a 40-yard run to put Rutgers at the Miami 1. Wimsatt punched in another 1-yard score to put the Scarlet Knights up by 11.\n“That was a really good running back,” Mauigoa said. “… We just didn’t fit our gaps and (missed) assignments, and that’s something we’ve got to work on.”\nBrown added a late rushing touchdown, and Miami recovered an onside kick to create some late drama, but the Hurricanes could not mount a game-tying drive.\nFive takeaways Offense flashes for moments with Jacurri Brown Brown played his first snaps of the season, and on some drives, that was obvious. Miami’s offense had four three-and-outs (one of which resulted in a blocked punt and touchdown) and was forced to punt four times. Brown also threw a brutal interception in the first half that led to a Scarlet Knights touchdown.\nBut Brown was efficient on some drives, leading UM down the field before the end of the first half and on their first drive of the second half. He threw several well-executed passes, including a touchdown to Restrepo and another near-touchdown that was overturned on review.\nBrown ended the game 20 of 31 for 181 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He also ran for a team-best 57 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns.\n“I thought he played hard and did a lot of really good things,” Cristobal said. “He’d love to have that one interception back. … But he really made some explosive plays. He found his way out of the pocket when the pocket collapsed a little bit. Made some really good throws, some others he’d like to have back against a team that’s a top-10 defense in the passing game.”\nXavier Restrepo hits 1,000 yards The Hurricanes’ veteran wide receiver could leave Miami and enter the NFL draft if he wants. If that is Restrepo’s choice, his final game at Miami was a stellar one.\nRestrepo made several good catches against Rutgers and nearly pulled off a touchdown catch from the seat of his pants. He ended the game with 99 yards, putting him at 1,092 yards for the season —tied with Andre Johnson for the fifth-most in UM history. He had 11 receptions, giving him 85 for the season — the most catches for a Hurricanes receiver in a single year.\n“Obviously, Restrepo’s done a really good job all year,” Cristobal said. “Made some big catches today, as well. … Always plays hard, always throws his body around and is a very reliable and explosive player.”\nDefense makes adjustments Miami’s defense struggled to stop Rutgers’ offensive attack early in the game, surrendering 153 yards on the Scarlet Knights’ first three drives.\nBut the Hurricanes bounced back, forcing punts on the subsequent three drives before surrendering another rushing touchdown to Monangai.\nMiami entered the game with the nation’s No. 10 rush defense but ultimately gave up 208 rushing yards, which was the second-most they have surrendered all year. The 292 total yards UM surrendered was the fifth-best game, by yardage, for the Hurricanes’ defense this season.\nInjuries to key players The worst-case scenario for a bowl game happened in the first quarter. Hurricanes star running back Mark Fletcher Jr. suffered a foot injury on a carry and had to be helped off the field. He was taken from the sideline in a cart and did not return to the game.\nCristobal said X-rays on Fletcher’s foot were negative but there was “certainly something else going on there.”\nFletcher, an American Heritage alum, has grown into a dependable running back for the Hurricanes in his first season. He ran for 514 yards and five touchdowns as a freshman.\nIn the fourth quarter, sophomore linebacker Wesley Bissainthe also suffered an upper-body injury, Cristobal said, and did not return to the game.\nRueben Bain ends freshman year on high note Freshman defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr. has blossomed into a star in his freshman season, and his final game of the year showed why.\nThe explosive defensive end racked up seven tackles with three tackles for loss, a career-high, and a forced fumble in the loss.\n“It means the world to him,” Cristobal said. “That’s what it is. He’s really talented, but he plays really, really hard, and it means the world to him. We need a bunch more guys like Rueben.”\n ",

    "text": "A Miami-Dade jury found a Honduran man guilty of raping and killing a woman in a Florida motel back in 2016.\nRonald Lopez Andrade could be facing the death penalty as eight jury members voted in favor and four voted against capital punishment for his role in the death of 30-year-old Yaimi Guevara Machado.\nPolice reports show that Andrade walked up to the Chesapeake Motel in Hialeah in 2016, asking staff for prostitutes. Andrade, who was 26 at the time, had been living illegally in the U.S. for less than a year. She resided in a building behind the motel, per Local 10 News.\nAndrade's arrest report indicates that hotel staff sold him alcohol and allowed him to remain on the premises despite him harassing a cleaning lady and a clerk.\nMeanwhile, the victim had been locked out of her room and was waiting for someone when Andrade approached her. Machado didn't have a shirt on, and Andrade let her borrow his, authorities said. Andrade then made sexual advances, which Machado rejected.\nThe Honduran man quickly became violent, according to official reports cited by the outlet, and took the victim to a grassy area near the hotel. Lopez Andrade then raped and strangled her to death, per an NBC report.\nDetectives said that Andrade left the scene when he noticed the victim was no longer moving and her face was covered in blood.\nPolice found Machado's naked body with her clothes nearby, and Andrade was arrested on a second-degree murder charge.\nThe victim's family sued the hotel and received $12 million due to the staff's negligence in preventing Machado's death. The family said that she was very intelligent and wanted to be a nurse.\nA judge will decide Andrade's sentence later this year.\n© 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

    "title": "NYU Suspends Group of Anti-Israel Adjunct Professors, At Least Some With Pay - Hamodia.com",
    "text": "By Matis Glenn\nNew York University has suspended, but continues to pay, a significant number of adjunct professors over anti-Israel comments and support of the Hamas terror group, according to a source familiar with the administration of the university, as colleges nationwide continue to see a rise in antisemitism and federal investigations into civil rights abuses at the institutions ramp up.\nOne professor, Tomasz Skiba, an adjunct professor of Applied Psychology, was suspended with pay following complaints from students and Jewish groups over a video posted to social media by the Polish-American teacher, in which he claimed that some of the hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas terrorists on October 7 “actually liked their time.” He continued to say that if he had been taken hostage, “who knows, maybe I would enjoy it, eat some good food, and meet some people.”\nSkiba is also a practicing psychologist.\nAmin Husain, a Palestinian-American adjunct at NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, was suspended this week, too, after a video of him downplaying the atrocities of Hamas on October 7 went viral online, in which he denied several heinous crimes that terrorists committed during the attacks, in which 1,200 Jewish people were killed and hundreds captured; the worst in Israel’s history. The video, released by The Free Press, was from a speech Husain gave at The New School, where he was invited to speak by members of the Students for Justice in Palestine organization. SJP is a national organization that denies the United States’ and Israel’s right to exist, and has been banned in Florida state-run schools due to its identifying itself as part of the “movement” started by Hamas. Husain taught at The New School, the New York Post reported, until 2019.\nHusain, 48, not only applauded Hamas’ attacks, calling them a “liberation struggle,” but said that he himself took part in the first Palestinian Intifada, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at Israelis,\nNews of Husain’s suspension was first reported by the Post on Thursday.\nNYU spokesperson John Beckman acknowledged the suspension, but did not say when the decision was made, or if he is still being paid.\n“To be clear, Mr. Husain has been suspended and is not currently teaching any classes at NYU,” Beckman told The Post. “All members of our community must adhere to the University’s discrimination and anti-harassment policies; We investigate all complaints we receive and take appropriate action, which may include taking measures, such as suspension.”\nAccording to the antisemitism watchdog group The Canary Mission, Husain has a long history of supporting terrorists, engaging in violent protests, calling for an end to Israel and the United States, and encouraging violence against NYPD officers.\nJewish teachers and students are reportedly afraid to voice their views or bring reports of antisemitism for fear of reprisals, though incidents have become very commonplace since October 7 . “It’s pretty scary to walk around,” one student told Hamodia in November, “I’m always looking over my shoulder to see who’s around,” he said.\n“One student approached a professor to request an extension for her assignments, because she is unable to eat or sleep and doesn’t feel safe at school. There was only one professor she felt comfortable asking for such a thing; she was scared to approach any of the others,” a source in the faculty told Hamodia .\n“Another student, a freshman from overseas, said there’s more antisemitism going on than the administration is made aware of….she said before the October 7 terror attacks, she was given an assignment, the premise of which was to describe how — not if — Israel is a colonial state. That’s the topic. She was crying and said she didn’t know what to do,” the source continued.\nIn the video, Husain said that The Canary Mission’s report on him “is one of the best biographies I have.”\n“It’s endless. The citations are better than I could ever imagine,” he said jokingly, which elicited laughs from his audience.\n“And everything they cite is true.\n“Living 18 years in Palestine, I was fighting in the first uprising, I was throwing rocks, molotov cocktails, the like.”\nAsked by Hamodia why only adjuncts have been suspended in NYU, and not full-time professors – including the over 260 members of Faculty for Justice in Palestine – the source familiar with the administration said that the latter are more difficult to suspend or dismiss, especially if they have tenure.\nIn November, NYU appointed Eve Tuck, professor who called Hamas’ terror attacks “affirming” and “resistance” to head a new center for indigenous studies.\nHundreds of incidents of antisemitism, including harassment, discrimination, vandalism, and the use of hateful slurs have occurred at New York University in recent weeks, as pro-Palestinian and Hamas-sympathetic rhetoric continues to be heard across the school, according to the Rabbi of the school-affiliated Jewish students center there. But a walkout on October 25, in which students left class to demonstrate against Israel, included overtly antisemitic and hateful messages, including an incident of assault.\nRabbi Yehudah Sarna, head of the Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life and Chief Rabbi of the Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue of the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, released a letter in November explaining the situation. “If you are reading this message and were previously unsure whether or not students were experiencing antisemitism, take it from me: THEY ARE.“\nRabbi Sarna said even Jewish students who are sympathetic to Palestinians have found themselves “confronted by straightforward antisemitic slurs, including ‘Hitler should have finished the job.’”\nAt one demonstration, protestors – holding signs accusing Israel of genocide – chanted “We don’t want no Jew state, we want all of it.”\nDuring a November student “walkout,” a poster calling for the release of the hostages taken prisoner by Hamas was vandalized with the words “They will not return home alive.” The same day, protestors carried pictures of a Star of David in a trash bin, calling to “keep the world clean,” likely a reference to the antisemitic trope of “dirty Jews.”\nAt one demonstration, protestors – holding signs accusing Israel of genocide – chanted “We don’t want no Jew state, we want all of it.”\nAdditionally on the day of the walkout, a person riding on a bike reportedly threw hot coffee on a Jewish student who was putting on tefillin.\nNYU, along with dozens of other U.S. universities – including Ivy League schools such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia – is under federal investigation for possible civil rights violations in its response to antisemitism on campus.",
