The Oregon Department of Emergency Management (OEM), Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Wasco County strongly recommend property owners not perform cleanup themselves, because of the serious toxic hazard threats posed by burned homes and outbuildings.\nDoing your own cleanup without proper protection puts your health at risk. Burned materials are hazardous and require more than gloves and a mask to protect your health. Buildings constructed before 2004 are likely to contain asbestos, which is carcinogenic.",

    "title": "Archbishop Anyolo prohibits Nairobi based clergy from blessing same sex couple unions",
    "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec 24 -The Catholic Archbishop of Nairobi Reverend Philip Anyolo has defied the order by Pope Francis to bless the union of same-sex couples saying any such activity would be scandalous to the faith. In a statement to all Catholic churches under the Archdiocese of Nairobi, Anyolo clarified that the declaration goes against the Word of God, the teaching of the Church, and African Cultural Traditions. Pope Francis had suggested he would be open to having the Catholic Church bless same-sex couples adding however, that the Church still considered same-sex relationships “objectively sinful” and would not recognize same-sex marriage. “All Clergy residing and ministering in the Archdiocese of Nairobi are prohibited from blessing irregular relationships, unions, or same-sex couples. Any form of blessing of same-sex unions and activities would go against God’s word, the teaching of the church,” he said. Archbishop Anyolo argued that the concept of ‘blessings’ of same-sex couple will be perceived as normalizing sin which the Church has no authority to do in the faithfulness of the Gospel and the Institution of marriage. “This Declaration confirms and reiterates the perennial teaching of the Church that marriage is to be affirmed as an “exclusive, stable and indissoluble union of a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children and that the Church does not have the power to impart blessings on unions of persons of the same sex,” said Anyolo’s statement in part. In the Catholic Church, a blessing is a prayer or plea, usually delivered by a minister, asking for God to look favorably on the person or people being blessed. The Catholic Archbishop explained that even though the ‘blessing’ would be done outside the liturgical rites it must be conformed within God’s will. This coming days after The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) moved to clarify the controversial decision by the Vatican allowing priests to bless same-sex unions saying it only allows ‘simple blessings’ outside the liturgical setting. The Kenyan bishops, responding to public concerns on the matter, said the move is meant to promote inclusion irrespective of the moral status of congregants. The bishops said the directive sanctioned by Pope Francis was part of efforts to expand the scope of pastoral blessings administered by the church. “This declaration does not in any way approve of “Same-sex Marriages” nor try to give a back-door recognition of such a union. It does not seek an alternative “union blessing” to substitute a Sacramental marriage,” said Most Rev Martin Kivuva, KCCB Chairperson. “What this document seeks is to awaken the invitation of all people to God’s action and grace. The Church seeks to reach out to all individuals in order to stir them to the path of conversion and salvation.” The Catholic Church came under heavy criticism for shifting from its earlier position after holding in 2021 that God “cannot bless sin”. Archbishop Kivuva went on to explain that the decision “does not change in any way the understanding of Marriage as a Sacrament in the Church, an indissoluble union between a man and a woman, for life.” Instead, the “Declaration remains firm on the traditional doctrine of the Church about marriage, not allowing any type of liturgical rite or blessing similar to a liturgical rite that can create confusion.”",

The trailer for the film features a few mainstay characters from the world of Batman, including Terry McGinnis, The Joker, The Royal Flush Gang, and a few other Easter Eggs. The film is finished with production, but is currently seeking additional funding in the post-production process. The team behind the movie have launched an [Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/batman-beyond-year-one-fan-film-post-production#/) looking to raise funds. Check out the Batman Beyond: Year One Teaser Trailer below (watch other clips and trailers): Who is involved with Batman Beyond: Year One?

Gotham has rebuilt itself as a city of the future, now known as Neo Gotham. It’s booming with neon lights, technology of tomorrow and brand-new villains running the streets in the absence of the caped crusader. That is, until a young Terry McGinnis discovers an elderly Bruce Wayne’s identity as the Batman and takes it upon himself to take the mantle. Our story follows Terry several months after becoming Batman. While he’s received some training, he’s still a fairly new crime fighter. A crime organization known as the Royal Flush Gang, longtime enemies of Bruce, has recently resurfaced in Gotham with a new family in charge. Join us as we watch Terry’s journey continue to unfold.”",

    "text": "Formula One Turbocharges November Gaming Revenue to Record High Posted on: December 28, 2023, 05:01h. Last updated on: December 28, 2023, 05:02h. The inaugural Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix powered gross gaming revenue (GGR) to new highs in November, as statewide win climbed upwards of $1.37 billion. It’s the [best November ever](https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-casinos-post-best-october-ever/) and the state’s second-best month of all-time behind only July 2023 when casinos won a little more than $1.4 billion. F1 was conceptualized as a way to speed up gaming on the Las Vegas Strip during November, traditionally a slow month in Southern Nevada. Despite some local opposition because of months-long road closures and business [disruptions](https://www.casino.org/news/f1-cancels-las-vegas-grand-prix-practice-due-to-loose-manhole-cover/) in the leadup to the Nov. 16-18 race weekend, Las Vegas’ bet seemingly paid off on the Strip casino floors. GGR on the Strip surged almost 23% from November 2022 to $821 million. That’s a new Strip record for November and its second-best month all-time behind this past July when gaming win totaled $834.9 million. F1 fans fancied table games, as costly minimums didn’t faze the European high-end clientele. Felt win on the Strip jumped 62%, with baccarat most responsible as the player-banker card game won over $178.3 million for the house. Slot win dropped about 1.3%, as the international VIPs with deep pockets didn’t fancy the one-armed bandits nearly as much as the tables. Slot revenue on the Strip totaled $410.9 million. F1 Delivers for Strip Despite [many headaches for locals](https://www.casino.org/news/is-f1-worth-it-to-las-vegas-and-what-does-that-question-even-mean/) and general visitors who were barred from seeing attractions like the Bellagio fountains and were quickly escorted by security when they stopped on Strip overpasses for photos, Michael Lawton, the senior economic analyst for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, says the city’s bet on F1 was a winning gamble. Along with a November to remember on the casino floors, Strip resorts reported strong hotel bookings and subsequent [resort-wide business](https://www.casino.org/news/mgm-cfo-halkyard-says-f1-race-broke-revenue-records/). The four-day period beginning on Nov. 16 was extremely profitable for both gaming and non-gaming activity on the Las Vegas Strip with some properties estimating those days established all-time record levels of revenue,” said Lawton. Lawton conceded that [luxury properties](https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-strip-non-gaming-revenue-looks-sturdy/) where F1 fans stayed and gambled were the biggest benefactors. While the Strip was bustling, the downtown area where more budget-conscious travelers tend to stay saw November GGR dip 2% to $81.2 million. Table games downtown reported a nearly 7% drop in win from November 2022, as the lower-minimum games were less busy. Downtown casinos also weren’t as lucky, as the table game win rate was just 7.6% compared to 15% on the Strip. 2023 Record Year Nevada gaming revenue through 11 months in 2023 totaled [more than $14.08 billion](https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-casinos-win-14b-2022-set-all-time-record/). The odds are nearly a sure thing that when December’s numbers come in, 2023 will mark the third consecutive year of record gaming win in the Silver State. Nevada casinos won $14.84 billion in 2022. It followed the $13.42 billion haul gamblers lost in 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic. The record play in 2021 and last year was partially credited to pent-up demand for leisure travel and many US residents having some extra disposable income from coronavirus stimulus programs. 2023, however, seemingly most demonstrates the resiliency of the US gaming industry, as its marquee and most critical market nears its third record year in a row.
