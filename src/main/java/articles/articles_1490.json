    "text": "Soaking-up the excitement: DHS swimmers ready to dive into 2024 season\nNew Dickinson High coach encourages positive energy, teamwork, ‘family’ vibes\nDICKINSON — The excitement continues to build on the pool deck for the Dickinson Midgets’ girls swim and dive team as they have their first meet on Saturday, Sept. 7 for the Capital City Invite in Bismarck.\nThe Midgets will be competing against six high schools at the BSC Aquatic and Wellness Center in 12 different races: three relays, one diving event and six individual races. The top-16 swimmers will score points.\nA big storyline heading into the 2024 season for DHS is the beginning of the Amy Smith era. Smith was named the new head coach of the Midgets back in July, taking over for Jenna Wolf after eight seasons at the helm.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPractices at the West River Community Center have been energetic and exciting, according to Smith, and swimmers have fed off her positive energy and mindset while adjusting to the changes she has made.\n“I think with change there can be some challenges, but the girls have been very positive throughout each week, and have embraced trying some new things throughout practice,” Smith said. “I see them encourage each other and cheer each other on and also push each other during practice.”\nWhile Smith has a plethora of experience coaching at the high-school level, there will be an adjustment period for her as she has not been on the pool deck in quite some time. Throughout her career as a swimmer and coach, one value instilled in her has remained constant: Work together as one big family.\n“I think that there's still a few things that I need to learn, as far as what all comes with the meets, but the swimming environment stays the same and the competition level stays the same,” Smith said. “I think some of the pieces that we've been talking about is that we're all in this together. We are one swim family. We're here to support each other and cheer each other on and be a positive light in every person on our team.”\nLast season, the Midgets came in fourth in the WDA championship and seventh in the state meet. However, they made some history last season. Senior Taylor Miller broke the 100m freestyle school record with a time of 54.67 and is looking to break another record in her final season as a Midget.\nShe will be participating in the 100-free again but will be competing in the 200m individual-medley, the 200m free relay and the 400m free relay.\nThe Capital City Invite kicks off at 10 a.m. MDT at the BSC Aquatic and Wellness Center.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "Gli Stati Uniti condurranno attacchi di rappresaglia contro obiettivi iraniani in Iraq e Siria\nGli Stati Uniti condurranno una serie di attacchi di rappresaglia contro milizie sciite sostenute dall'Iran in Siria e Iraq. A dirlo questa sera il segretario alla Difesa americano, Lloyd Austin, confermando che i raid verranno effettuati in più giorni. Il comandante del Pentagono ha spiegato che la misura costituirà una risposta agli attacchi di droni che domenica scorsa\nhanno causato la morte di tre soldati USA e il ferimento di altre decine nella base militare Tower 22, in Giordania. Quei raid, ha specificato sempre Austin, sono stati condotti utilizzando droni di fabbricazione iraniana.\nParlando ad una conferenza stampa al Pentagono, Austin ha detto: \"Daremo una risposta a più livelli e avremo la capacità di replicare più volte. Adotteremo tutte le azioni necessarie per difendere gli Stati Uniti, i nostri interessi e il nostro popolo. Risponderemo dove, quando e come decideremo\". Il Segretario alla Difesa ha sottolineato che gli Stati Uniti non sono in guerra con l’Iran e Washington non sa se Teheran fosse a conoscenza degli specifici attacchi di droni di domenica scorsa organizzati da quella che ha descritto come l’asse della resistenza. Austin ha dichiarato comunque che \"non ha importanza poiché sappiamo che l’Iran sponsorizza questi gruppi e li finanzia, e in alcuni casi li addestra\".\nLa risposta degli Stati Uniti all'attacco a Tower 22 era attesa, tuttavia Joe Biden e altri funzionari della difesa hanno affermato che Washington non sta cercando una guerra più ampia con l’Iran o un’escalation delle tensioni nella regione. \"Non è quello che cerco\", ha detto il Presidente USA ai giornalisti alla Casa Bianca all'inizio di questa settimana. I piani di risposta approvati, secondo quanto riferito, dovrebbero prendere di mira obiettivi iraniani in Siria e Iraq, ma non dovrebbero interessare il territorio dell'Iran.",
