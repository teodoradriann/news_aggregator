    "text": "In a groundbreaking revelation, scientists have uncovered that certain animal species possess the remarkable ability to reproduce without a mate, a process known as parthenogenesis. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of animal biology and the potential for species survival in challenging environments. The Phenomenon of Asexual Reproduction [Parthenogenesis](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-animals-babies.html#google_vignette), a term derived from the Greek words for \"virgin\" and \"birth,\" is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into an individual without fertilization. This rare and fascinating biological process has been observed in a variety of species, including plants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and fish. Case Studies: From Boa Constrictors to Komodo Dragons A striking example of parthenogenesis comes from a Brazilian Rainbow Boa in the UK named Ronaldo, who gave birth to 14 offspring despite having no contact with a male for over nine years. This event, which took place at the City of Portsmouth College, has sparked interest and curiosity in the scientific community. Similarly, Flora, a Komodo dragon at Chester Zoo in England, became a subject of fascination when she produced offspring through parthenogenesis. These instances, although rare, suggest that parthenogenesis could be more common in captivity than previously thought. Understanding the Mechanism Behind Virgin Births The process of parthenogenesis involves an egg fusing with a polar body, a cell that carries genetic information typically provided by sperm. This fusion triggers cell division, leading to the development of an embryo. While this method of reproduction results in less genetic variation, which can be detrimental to the health and development of the offspring, it is nonetheless a remarkable survival strategy.

Scientists believe that in the absence of sufficient mates, females may resort to asexual reproduction to ensure the continuation of their species. However, the offspring produced through parthenogenesis have less genetic variation, which can lead to developmental problems and potentially impact the long-term viability of the species. Despite these concerns, the ability to reproduce asexually remains a fascinating aspect of animal biology, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth. What are the potential benefits of parthenogenesis? Parthenogenesis offers a range of potential benefits for species that utilize this reproductive strategy. It allows females to reproduce [without the need to find a mate](https://sciencing.com/benefits-parthenogenesis-13770.html), saving time and energy that can be used for other survival activities. This form of asexual reproduction can lead to a rapid increase in population size, as every individual is capable of reproduction. In environments where conditions are stable, and a species is thriving, parthenogenesis ensures the continuation of successful genetic traits without the genetic shuffle of sexual reproduction. Additionally, it can be [advantageous for the colonization of new habitats](https://education.seattlepi.com/benefits-parthenogenesis-4022.html), as parthenogenetic organisms might be able to store more nutrients and grow more rapidly. Beyond its natural occurrence, parthenogenesis has significant implications for medical research, particularly in the generation of stem cells for genetic studies and potential therapeutic applications.

    "text": "Google employees quizzed top management on Tuesday after receiving smaller-than-expected pay rises — despite the company reporting a strong performance across services. The matter was brought up on Tuesday during the company’s monthly meeting after receiving a significant number of upvotes.\nAccording to a Business Insider report, top officials explained that some employees in less technical roles had received smaller equity packages this year in order to calibrate pay to local markets. John Casey — the VP for global compensation and benefits — however noted that more than 80% of Googlers saw an year-on-year increase in their 2025 compensation.\nALSO READ India plays Google Tax gambit to counter Trump’s tariff tirade, what is it? The TGIF meetings have changed drastically as the company grew — eventually becoming monthly affairs that focus on product and business strategy. The company now uses an AI tool to summarize queries posed by employees during town hall meetings. A Business Insider report from 2024 however revealed that this new tool tends to ‘soften’ questions into a more palatable format for top leaders before allowing employees an upvote.\nCasey also said that the company wanted to pay employees who make an impact and noted that the compensation structure was set up to reward high performers. Compensation packages with Google typically include a base salary and equity awards as well as bonuses in some cases.\nAccording to a Business Insider report from last year, Google had reduced the size of their compensation packages in 2024 — with some employees even seeing a reduction in overall pay. Googlers learn about increases to their existing compensation following the annual performance review. One employee had told the publication at the time that refreshers were noticeably smaller despite a good performance review — with many seeing base pay increases lower than 3%.\nALSO READ Google’s Larry Page returns with new startup focusing on AI-powered manufacturing: Report The remarks also come mere months after Google CEO Sundar Pichai urged employees to ‘move faster’ and ‘stay scrappy’. The company reportedly views 2025 as a pivotal year — especially for artificial intelligence.\n“I think 2025 will be critical. I think it’s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment, and need to move faster as a company. The stakes are high. These are disruptive moments. In 2025, we need to be relentlessly focused on unlocking the benefits of this technology and solve real user problems,” CNBC quoted him as saying in mid-December last year.",

    "text": "Skywatchers are in for a spectacular celestial event this week as seven planets—Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn—briefly align in the evening sky.\nThis rare phenomenon, known as a planetary parade, will not be visible this clearly again until 2040.\nThe best chance to witness this stunning alignment will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\nOf the seven planets, four—Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury—will be visible to the naked eye.\nVenus and Jupiter, the brightest of the group, will be the easiest to spot, while Mars will stand out with its signature reddish glow. Saturn, positioned low on the horizon, may be trickier to see, and Uranus and Neptune will require a telescope for a clear view.\nAlthough the planets will be aligned, the window of visibility will be brief, so timing is essential.\nDr. Edward Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, explained, “There’s a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.”\nHowever, the alignment won’t last long. As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will quickly set behind the horizon, making them particularly difficult to spot.\n“You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon,” Dr. Bloomer added.\nAfter that, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars will remain visible for a much longer time.\nFor the best view, it’s recommended to head to a location with a clear, unobstructed horizon and minimal light pollution. Given the timing of the event, skywatchers should plan to be in place just after sunset for the best chance to see all seven planets in their brief alignment.\nThis planetary parade provides a rare opportunity to witness the mechanics of our solar system in action, with planets orbiting the Sun within a similar flat plane.\nAs they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, their alignment appears as a stunning visual display, even though they are separated by vast distances in space.\nThe planets’ orbital paths often align from Earth’s perspective, offering us a fleeting but unforgettable glimpse of the solar system’s structure.\nSource: Express Tribune",

    "text": "The Central Meteorological Observatory issued its first red alert for fog since 2017. Conditions were expected to improve from Saturday evening, when a cold wave of air is expected to blow over the country. More than 600 flights were delayed in various cities including Urumqi, Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Shandong's Qingdao and Shanghai, tracking app Flight Master showed. Severe fog was expected in parts of northern province Hebei, central province Henan, eastern provinces Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong as well as in the municipalities Shanghai and Chongqing from Friday morning, the National Meteorological Centre said. Dense fog in predicted in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai leading to low visibility of less than 200 metres, and less than 50 metres in some areas. In the north, around the capital of northwestern Xinjiang region, Urumqi and areas between the Yellow River and Huai River, light to moderate haze is forecast, with heavy haze affecting Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan. The severe weather was due to high humidity and poor atmospheric diffusion conditions, the forecaster said. China has experienced a year of climate extremes. Last week, most of the country was hit by a cold snap that rewrote records with sub-freezing temperatures, in contrast to the summer, when scorching heat that breached 52 degree Celsius (125.6 Fahrenheit) in the northwest blistered the country. Summer storms also brought record rainfall to Beijing and flooding elsewhere. On Friday, the central observatory told the public to tune into weather and traffic alerts, and advised them to reduce time outdoors. Residents in parts of Shandong, Anhui and in Jiangsu should avoid going out unless necessary, it added. In Shanghai, some ferry routes were temporarily suspended and some sections of highways, as well as a bridge to a container port, were temporarily closed. Earlier, a thick grey fog had all but obscured the city's colourful skyscrapers but skies were now clearer. \"I have never see the Pearl Tower in the fog before. Now the fog has completely dispersed. I have been recording photos of the Oriental Pearl Tower,\" said 25-year-old tourist Xu Lejun from Jiangxi province. In Jiangsu, some sections of several expressways remained shut since Thursday evening, while Hebei and Henan temporarily closed segments of multiple highways on Friday morning, citing weather conditions, according to state television CCTV and provincial capital authorities said.",

    "text": "Where resilience and community converge, one journey broadens our understanding of hope and friendship. Here are some numbers to consider as you unfold the layers of this story: 18 to 29—over 10 years that redefine lives and camaraderie; 3 to 159 —individuals who pledged themselves in an empowering movement; and $5,000 to $125,756 (as of October 31, 2024)—from initial hope to fueling a life-changing mission.\nFor Karl Schmidt, Alex Budde and Treven Goldsmith, a brain tumor journey transformed their friendship and revealed the profound impact they could make together when they formed Team Karl for the ABTA Los Angeles BT5K.\nKarl, Alex and Treven met at their fraternity more than 10 years ago at the University of Southern California (USC). They quickly found common ground with skiing, hiking, and sports, among other adventures together. One of their countless fond memories was cramming 12 people in a 3-bedroom Airbnb for a USC football trip. Most ended up sleeping on a rented bus parked outside.\nThey forged a bond that defied the miles between them after graduation; connected by their adventures and life milestones, like marriage or new careers. But no one in their group would ever dream that a brain tumor diagnosis would interrupt the natural course of their lives.\nNo signs or symptoms of a brain tumor “In the summer of 2023, I was on a family vacation in Oregon where I grew up, when a seizure struck. I was rushed to the local hospital, where the medical team discovered a brain tumor the size of a fist. The pathology report determined that I had an oligodendroglioma, a rare brain cancer,” said Karl Schmidt, 29 of Corvallis, OR.\nKarl had no previous symptoms: not seizures, not even headaches.\n“To say it was a shocking discovery is an understatement,” said Karl. “I underwent surgery shortly after the seizure to remove the bulk of the tumor. That fall, I started chemotherapy for six months. This July, I had a second surgery to remove more residual tumor. I’ll complete proton radiation in mid-November, and things are looking good,” said Karl.\nWhen Alex and Treven learned of Karl’s brain tumor diagnosis, they felt helpless to support him. “We wanted to take away this devastating diagnosis – make the nightmare go away,” said Treven.\n“But we knew we had to give him space since his family was there to provide daily care,” said Alex.\nWhat is an Oligodendroglioma? Oligodendroglioma (or ‘oligos’) are primary brain tumors that mostly occur and stay in the brain, rather than impact other organs. The cause of oligo tumors is unknown at this time.\nAccording to the ABTA patient and caregiver education on oligodendrogliomas , “the discovery of the genetic mutation in the IDH1 or IDH2 gene and the missing parts of the two chromosomes (1p and 19q) is important, because the lack of both chromosomes can help determine an individual’s likely outcome of the disease (prognosis) and may predict response to treatment.”\nOligos account for just 4.5% of primary brain tumors and are most common in adults. For an oligio brain tumor to occur in Karl, a young man in his 20s, that is rarer still.\nPower of Community and Friendship Understanding that there is no cure for oligo tumors right now, Alex and Treven were driven to show their unwavering support for Karl in the fight against this rare disease. They conducted their own investigation of the best options and considered next steps to take that would have ripple effects in the years to come.\nThey decided to support the ABTA by forming Team Karl to participate in the Los Angeles BT5K, a growing annual event to raise awareness and funds to support patient and caregiver resources and brain tumor research.\n“Through the ABTA BT5K, we could help Karl in a tangible way. We could raise funds that could be directed to oligo research,” said Treven.\nFor 10 months, they reached out to family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues both locally and globally. By the time of this publication, their team had raised over $125,000—enough to already fully fund an ABTA Discovery Grant to further research the IDH1 gene mutation. Their dedication inspired 159 supporters from across the country to join them in supporting Karl, and Team Karl has received over 500 donations to-date. Team Karl continues to accept donations through the end of the year. Karl, Treven, and Alex also served on the LA BT5K Host Committee to help put on the best event yet.\n“The success of Team Karl is a testament to having a strong network of people who want to get involved in some way,” said Alex. “People would buy t-shirts to help raise funds for the team or someone made a single donation of $500 from across the world to show their support.”\nEach gesture, big or small, reflected the collective power of love and community. For Karl, it was not only about funding research but also about feeling embraced by those around him.\n“I am the luckiest man in the world to have an army of people behind me and in lock-step with me on this journey,” said Karl.\nFive Ways Karl’s Community Empowered Him Throughout the Brain Tumor Journey Offered camaraderie and companionship Spent quality time together as much or as little as Karl needed Listened and understood Karl’s needs during treatment/recovery Supported a cause in Karl’s name; conducted all the research and minimized information overload Gave him love, support, and the opportunity to pursue a cause close to his heart with Team Karl.
