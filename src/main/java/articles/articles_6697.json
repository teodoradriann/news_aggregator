    "text": "As of the 96th Academy Awards, a notable display of solidarity emerged among celebrities advocating for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Personalities such as Billie Eilish, director Ava DuVernay, Mark Ruffalo, and Ramy Youssef, among others, arrived at the red carpet adorned with red pins, symbolizing their support for peace in the Gaza conflict.\nOscars 2024 Live Updates | Oscars 2024 Winners List\nRamy Youssef pleads for ceasefire\nDuring interviews on the red carpet, Ramy Youssef expressed the collective plea for an immediate and enduring ceasefire, speaking on the need for safety and justice for all parties involved, particularly the Palestinian people. The pins worn by the celebrities were part of an initiative led by Artists4Ceasefire, an alliance within the entertainment industry that sent an open letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to prioritize efforts towards a ceasefire.\nTheir stance resonated with a broader message advocating for peace and stability in the region. The demonstration highlighted the urgency of ending violence, particularly amidst ongoing bombings and escalating tensions. The visible support from high-profile figures underscored a unified call for dialogue and resolution.\nProtestors delay cause disruption\nDespite the protest's delay causing disruptions, including blocking traffic and impeding arrivals, the significance of their advocacy remained steadfast. Their presence at the Oscars served not only as a platform for glamour but also as a voice for humanitarian concerns, amplifying the call for immediate action towards a ceasefire and lasting peace in the region.",

My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",
