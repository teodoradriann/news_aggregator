    "text": "Annie advises today's reader to have a sit-down conversation with her husband, but if that doesn't work, she should confront her mother-in-law directly. Getty Images\nBy Dear Annie, Annie Lane Dear Annie: My husband, “Mark,” and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship. We’ve always butt heads a little bit about his mother, but recently we have started really clashing over her. She’s always been a little overbearing, but lately, it feels like she’s trying to control our lives. She’ll drop by unannounced, criticize how we’re raising our two kids and even question how we spend our money. Last week she dropped in when our daughter was on the iPad (we set screen time limits for her), and she went on for 45 minutes about how bad screens are for children.\nI’ve tried to set boundaries, but Mark doesn’t back me up. He says it’s just how she is and that I should let it go. It seems to just roll off his back. I don’t want to cause a rift, but her constant interference is making me resent her -- and him.\nHow can I address this without creating even more tension? -- Feeling Stuck\nDear Feeling Stuck: Start by explaining to Mark how much his mother’s comments are getting to you. He might not realize the extent to which her unsolicited advice is bothering you. With him on your side, you can both be on guard to nip her comments in the bud and quickly change the subject.\nIf that doesn’t work, then you might need to sit down with her and have a direct conversation about how her comments are not just unhelpful but detrimental to your relationship with her.\nView prior ‘Dear Annie’ columns\n“How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” is out now!

    "text": "NATO’s top military official hailed Morocco’s long-standing commitment to international security and its role as a key partner in the fight against regional threats. Chairman of NATO’s Military Committee Admiral Rob Bauer praised Morocco’s dedication to social, political and economic reforms during a news conference in Rabat. Morocco and Qatar cooperate closely in security matters Bauer, who was on a three-day visit to the North African kingdom, noted Morocco’s active participation in NATO exercises, sharing expertise in counterterrorism, illegal immigration control and maritime security. ; ; Armoured vehicle of the Moroccan Army - PHOTO/FILE ; “NATO is proud to count Morocco among its partners,” Bauer said, stressing the strong ties built through the Mediterranean Dialogue and NATO’s cooperation programme. He noted the shared challenges faced by NATO members and countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including extremism, terrorism and nuclear proliferation. “While approaches may differ, transforming our diversity into strength is crucial,” said Bauer. He noted NATO’s commitment to deepening ties with regional partners such as Morocco, stressing the need for increased collaboration to ensure regional peace and stability. Morocco has the most sought-after radars in the world This, he added, requires NATO to be a better listener and to invest in its partnerships by fostering human capital and expertise. Various aspects of cooperation between NATO and Morocco were discussed in Rabat on Monday at a meeting between Admiral Bauer and Morocco’s Minister in charge of the National Defence Administration Abdellatif Loudiyi. Moroccan Deputy Minister of National Defence Abdellatif Loudiyi walks past a guard of honour as he arrives to attend a meeting of defence ministers of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 20, 2016 - PHOTO/SAUL LOEB/AFP The admiral’s visit to the kingdom was part of NATO’s efforts to strengthen its partnership with members of the Mediterranean dialogue, with a view to assess the regional security situation and consolidate opportunities for cooperation with the Alliance,” the National Defence Administration said in a statement. The same day, ;Bauer gave a lecture at the Royal College of Higher Military Education in Kenitra for military officers on the theme of “NATO’s perspectives and strategies.” the statement added. NATO officials frequently emphasise the importance of cooperation with Morocco, which has been present in several high-level events to discuss its role and commitment towards regional security. Morocco was designated as a major non-NATO ally in 2004. In his 2023 annual report, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted the importance of partnership with Morocco in tackling security challenges. ; NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - AFP/JOHANNA GERON Morocco’s law enforcement as well as the kingdom’s army participated in several NATO-sponsored events including Operation Sea Guardian, alongside forces from Britain, Spain and Portugal. Morocco also took part in the STEADFAST JACKAL 23 exercise, which was focused on computer-assisted command centres, held in Spain and Norway in late 2023. The North African country, Moroccan officials say, continues to strengthen its security approach to address several challenges, including the scourge of terrorism-related crimes, in addition to other forms of transnational crimes including human trafficking, among others.",

Durante la emisión de 'Magaly TV, la firme' del 7 de abril, la conocida conductora no dudó en arremeter contra la influencer, acusándola de un comportamiento abusivo y, peor aún, de extorsión. Todo comenzó cuando la empresaria peruana, durante su despedida de soltera en Cartagena, Colombia, fue grabada en las afueras de la discoteca Alquímico mostrando su celular y aparentemente presumiendo de sus \"cuatro millones de seguidores\" para intentar forzar su entrada al establecimiento.\nAnte estas acusaciones, Baigorria no tardó en responder. En la emisión de 'Amor y fuego' del 9 de abril, la influencer lanzó una contundente advertencia a Magaly Medina, asegurando que las palabras de la conductora son \"muy graves\" y que la presentadora tendrá que demostrar lo que dijo. \"Que feo que haya dicho que estoy extorsionando, que soy extorsionadora y palabras muy graves que ella va a tener que demostrar\", expreso sumamente molesta.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Amigo de Alejandra Baigorria expone el verdadero motivo detrás del escándalo de la empresaria en una discoteca colombiana]\nAlejandra Baigorria con todo contra Magaly Medina\nAlejandra Baigorria no se guardó nada al responder a las duras acusaciones de Magaly Medina. En su intervención en 'Amor y fuego' del 9 de abril, la influencer se mostró visiblemente molesta, asegurando que ya no permitirá que la conductora siga lanzando comentarios sin fundamento sobre su persona.\n\"Siempre hablan sin preguntar, investigar, simplemente se lanzan a hablar lo que no es, no lo voy a permitir. Ya siento que esto es una cosa muy dura contra mi persona y puedo dejar pasar que me diga huachafa, que me diga que ruego por amor, no me importa. Ella solo quiere chancarme, quiere hundirme\", declaró , evidenciando su frustración por los constantes ataques de la 'Urraca'.\nAdemás, Baigorria aprovechó la oportunidad para defender su labor como emprendedora y su imagen pública, señalando que no tolera que se critique su trabajo y sus logros. \"Trato de enseñar que si se puede hacer negocios en el Perú, que se puede ser una emprendedora, pero eso no lo saca. A mí me molesta porque ella se mete con todo lo que tiene que ver conmigo. Nunca he opinado ni de su marido, ni su familia, de su cumpleaños, de sus viajes ni de sus amigas\", manifestó, destacando que nunca se ha referido de manera negativa a la vida personal de Medina, y calificando la actitud de la conductora como un intento de destruir su reputación.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Alejandra Baigorria responde a las críticas por llevar figura de Said a su despedida de soltera: 'No saben cómo es nuestro amor']\nAlejandra Baigorria defiende a sus amigas de críticas de Magaly Medina\nEn medio de su enfrentamiento con Magaly Medina, Alejandra Baigorria también se mostró firme al defender a sus amigas de los comentarios despectivos que la conductora lanzó durante su programa. Según Baigorria, Medina no tiene en cuenta los sentimientos de las personas a las que critica. \"A ella (Magaly) no le importa lo que esas personas sientan. ¿Sabes qué dijo? Dijo, ella se ha ido (a Colombia) y no tiene amigas, se ha ido con sus ayudantes esas que la ayudan en Gamarra. Para mí, eso es un comentario clasista, despectivo, discriminante. ¿Por qué? ¿No puedo ser amiga de mis trabajadores?\", expresó la influencer, visiblemente molesta por las insinuaciones de Medina.\nBaigorria defendió su derecho a tener una relación cercana con las personas que trabajan con ella, argumentando que no debería ser criticada por esa razón. Además, consideró que las palabras de Medina no solo eran ofensivas, sino también injustas, ya que trataban de menospreciar a quienes la apoyan en su vida personal y profesional.",
