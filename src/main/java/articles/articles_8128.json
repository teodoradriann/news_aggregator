    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.“It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "4月2日，数码闲聊站透露了一加今年首款小屏旗舰手机——一加13T的核心配置信息。据悉，这款新机将于今年4月正式发布。\n一加中国区总裁李杰此前曾表示，一加13T将是有史以来电池容量最大、续航最出色的小屏手机。这一说法无疑让人对这款新机充满了期待。\n配置方面，一加13T将搭载高通骁龙8至尊版移动平台。该平台于2024年10月发布，采用台积电3nm工艺打造，集成了第二代定制的高通Oryon CPU、高通Adreno GPU和增强的高通Hexagon NPU，性能强劲，是目前手机SoC中的佼佼者。\n此外，一加13T还将配备一块6.31英寸的OLED直屏，分辨率为1.5K，显示效果出色。而电池容量方面，一加13T更是超越了同尺寸产品的常规水平，达到了6200mAh，支持80W有线快速充电，续航表现令人期待。同时，机身重量控制在约185g，保持了良好的手感。\n在同尺寸的产品中，一加13T的电池容量具有明显优势。例如，小米15的电池容量为5400mAh，vivo X200 Pro mini为5700mAh，而还未发布的OPPO Find X8s也同样只有5700mAh。\n从配置上来看，一加13T的定位较高，售价大概率会超过3000元。其主要竞争对手包括小米15和vivo X200 Pro mini等同样定位高端的小屏旗舰手机。",

    "title": "Les préparatifs pour le mariage de ma fille se sont transformés en une confrontation entre belles-mères - Histoire du jour",
    "text": "Une femme reçoit un collier luxueux par la poste et découvre qu'il a été envoyé par erreur - Histoire du jour\n02 décembre 2024\nJe voulais organiser le mariage parfait pour ma fille, mais sa future belle-mère avait sa propre vision. Ce qui avait commencé comme des préparatifs joyeux s'est rapidement transformé en un champ de bataille, où chaque décision devenait un sujet de conflit. Le rêve d'une journée parfaite a commencé à s'éloigner au fur et à mesure que la tension montait.\nLorsque ma fille et son fiancé ont annoncé qu'ils allaient se marier, j'étais ravie ! Leslie et Scott étaient faits l'un pour l'autre, et j'avais hâte de me plonger dans les préparatifs du mariage.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nMais je n'étais pas la seule à vouloir m'impliquer. Jane, la mère de Scott, était tout aussi enthousiaste que moi. Nous nous étions déjà rencontrées lors de quelques réunions de famille, mais nous n'étions pas particulièrement proches.\nJe me suis dit que cela ne ferait pas de mal d'avoir un peu d'aide supplémentaire, alors j'ai accepté qu'elle organise le mariage avec moi.\nJe n'ai pas tardé à regretter cette décision. Le premier signe de difficulté est apparu lorsque nous sommes allées choisir la robe de mariée de Leslie. Je connaissais le style de ma fille - simple, élégant et classique.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nC'est pourquoi j'ai suggéré des robes qui reflétaient sa personnalité, des robes que je savais qu'elle aimerait. Mais Jane avait d'autres idées. Elle insistait pour que Leslie ait la robe la plus extravagante, quelque chose qui crie le luxe et l'opulence.\nLorsque Leslie est sortie de la cabine d'essayage dans cette robe volumineuse, j'ai eu du mal à en croire mes yeux. Elle était si grande qu'on aurait dit qu'elle occupait toute la pièce.\n\"Oh, tu es superbe !\" s'est exclamée Jane, ses yeux lumineux tandis qu'elle admirait la robe.\nJe n'ai pas pu retenir ma réaction. \"Elle ressemble à un marshmallow !\" ai-je protesté. La robe était énorme, engloutissant Leslie dans des couches de tissu.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Pexels\nJane s'est tournée vers moi, la voix ferme. \"Non, elle ressemble à une princesse !\" a-t-elle insisté, son ton ne laissant aucune place au doute.\nLeslie s'est regardée dans le miroir, visiblement peu sûre d'elle. \"Je ne suis pas sûre...\" a-t-elle murmuré.\n\"Ma fille ne se mariera pas dans cette robe !\" ai-je déclaré, incapable de contenir ma frustration.\n\"Et mon fils serait très heureux de voir sa femme dans une telle robe !\" a répliqué Jane, le ton tranchant.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Ce n'est pas à toi d'en décider !\" ai-je rétorqué, mon attitude protectrice envers Leslie et de ses choix prenant le dessus.\nLeslie, prenant enfin la parole, a dit : \"Et ce n'est définitivement pas à vous deux de décider. Je pense que je vais opter pour la robe précédente.\"\n\"Essaie au moins la robe que j'ai choisie\", ai-je insisté, espérant qu'elle reviendrait sur sa décision.\n\"Maman, j'ai déjà fait mon choix\", a-t-elle dit fermement en retournant dans la cabine d'essayage.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"C'est dommage qu'elle n'ait pas aimé cette robe\", a marmonné Jane.\n\"Je ne vous laisserai pas faire de ma fille une blague\", ai-je répondu, les mots s'échappèrent avant que je ne puisse les arrêter.\nJane m'a regardée froidement. \"Je n'ai pas besoin de le faire ; tu t'en charges très bien toi-même\", a-t-elle répliqué.\nJ'ai sursauté, incapable de croire qu'elle avait dit cela. Avant que je puisse répondre, Jane a simplement pris le champagne et en a bu une gorgée, m'ignorant.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nPlus nous avancions dans les préparatifs du mariage, plus les disputes avec Jane s'aggravaient. Chaque détail devenait une bataille. Nous étions censés organiser le plus beau jour de la vie de nos enfants, mais cela ressemblait plus à une guerre.\nLa tension a atteint son paroxysme lorsque nous sommes arrivées chez Scott et Leslie pour décider enfin du lieu du mariage.\nJane a été la première à prendre la parole. \"Je suggère d'organiser la cérémonie à l'église que Scott fréquentait lorsqu'il était enfant\", a-t-elle dit d'une voix calme mais ferme. \"C'est un endroit très spécial pour notre famille\".\nJe sentais ma frustration monter. \"Je suis contre\", ai-je dit en essayant de garder une voix stable. \"Je suggère de faire la cérémonie à l'extérieur. Rendons-la spéciale pour tout le monde.\"\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nJane s'est tournée vers moi, le visage marqué de stupeur. \"Où est la spiritualité là-dedans ?\" a-t-elle demandé sur un ton froid.\n\"C'est un mariage, pas une confession\", ai-je rétorqué. J'en avais assez qu'elle mette toujours en avant ses idées comme si elles étaient les seules qui comptaient. \"De plus, le prêtre ne laisserait pas le diable entrer dans l'église\", ai-je ajouté en jetant un regard acerbe dans sa direction.\nJane n'a pas perdu une seconde. \"Alors tu peux rester à l'extérieur\", a-t-elle lâché, les yeux plissés.\nJ'ai fait claquer ma langue, refusant de reculer. \"Nous pouvons organiser la cérémonie sur une falaise près de la plage\", ai-je suggéré avec un sourire en coin. \"Si nous avons de la chance, Jane pourrait tomber\".\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Maman, arrête\", m'a interrompu Leslie, la voix tendue. Je voyais bien qu'elle s'énervait, et je détestais que l'organisation de son mariage en soit arrivée là.\nScott, qui était resté silencieux jusqu'à présent, a soudain pris la parole. \"Je suis d'accord avec ma mère ; le mariage devrait avoir lieu à l'église\", a-t-il dit, le ton définitif.\nJ'ai cligné des yeux de surprise. \"Quoi ? Depuis quand ?\" ai-je demandé en me tournant vers Leslie. \"Nous avons parlé d'une cérémonie sur la plage pas plus tard qu'hier\".\n\"Et maintenant, j'ai réalisé que je voulais me marier dans mon église\", a répondu Scott en croisant les bras comme pour défier quelqu'un.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Mais je ne veux pas me marier dans une église ! Je veux que mon mariage soit beau !\" a crié Leslie, la voix tremblante.\nJane s'est interposée, sa voix dégoulinant d'une douceur qui sonnait fausse. \"Un mariage à l'église peut être beau aussi\", a-t-elle insisté, agissant comme si elle savait ce qui était le mieux pour tout le monde.\n\"Un mariage dans une église est très déprimant\", ai-je dit en secouant la tête. L'idée que ma fille se marie dans un endroit aussi sombre ne me plaisait pas.\n\"Il n'y a rien de déprimant là-dedans\", a fulminé Scott, qui a clairement pris mes paroles pour une attaque personnelle.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Je ne veux pas me marier là où ils organisent des enterrements !\" a hurlé Leslie, sa frustration étant à son comble.\nJane, qui n'est jamais du genre à reculer, a jeté de l'huile sur le feu. \"Scott a aussi son mot à dire dans TON mariage\", a-t-elle dit en insistant sur le mot \"ton\", pour bien montrer qu'elle ne voyait pas les choses de cette façon.\n\"Exactement !\" Scott a sauté sur l'occasion, le visage rouge de colère. \"Tu prends toutes les décisions, et quand je veux quelque chose, tu n'écoutes pas !\"\nLes yeux de Leslie s'écarquillèrent de stupeur. \"Sérieusement ? Je ne t'écoute pas ?!\" a-t-elle craché à son tour. \"Nous avons commandé cet horrible gâteau uniquement parce que la pâtissière est l'amie de ta mère !\".\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Mais c'est toi et ta mère qui décidez de tout le reste !\" Scott a crié, sa frustration débordant.\n\"Parce que je veux un beau mariage, pas un truc de mauvais goût !\" Leslie s'est écriée, des larmes commençant à se former dans ses yeux.\n\"Et je veux avoir mon mot à dire sur mon propre mariage !\" Scott a hurlé, sa voix résonnant dans la pièce.\nLa tension qui régnait dans la pièce était insupportable. C'est alors que Leslie a lâché des mots qui nous ont tous choqués. \"Peut-être qu'on ne devrait pas se marier du tout alors ?!\"\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nScott n'a pas hésité. \"Tu sais quoi ?! Peut-être qu'on ne devrait pas !\" a-t-il crié à son tour.\nLa pièce est devenue silencieuse. Leslie s'est figée, fixant Scott en état de choc, puis s'est tournée vers moi, les larmes aux yeux. \"Allons-y, maman\", a-t-elle chuchoté, sa voix étant à peine audible.\nAlors que nous quittions la maison, je savais que je devais aider Leslie à comprendre qu'elle faisait une erreur. \"Ma chérie, je sais que l'organisation d'un mariage est stressante, mais tu n'es pas obligée d'en finir ainsi. Vous pouvez vous arranger, trouver un compromis\", ai-je dit gentiment.\nLeslie s'est tournée vers moi, les yeux remplis de frustration. \"Tu es sérieuse, maman ? C'est toi qui dis ça ? Toi et Jane, vous vous disputez à propos de tout ! J'ai l'impression que c'est votre mariage, pas le mien et celui de Scott\", a-t-elle répondu, la voix teintée de colère et de blessure.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nJe me suis rendue compte qu'elle avait raison. Jane et moi étions tellement absorbées par l'organisation du mariage que nous avions perdu de vue ce qui comptait vraiment.\nC'était le jour spécial de Leslie et Scott, et ils méritaient de prendre les décisions qui façonneraient leur avenir ensemble.\nComment pouvais-je laisser ma fille perdre l'amour de sa vie à cause de nos petites disputes ? J'ai senti un profond sentiment de culpabilité m'envahir.\nLe bonheur de Leslie et de Scott était plus important que n'importe quel désaccord entre Jane et moi. Je savais que je devais prendre du recul et les laisser prendre les devants.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nLe lendemain, Jane et moi nous sommes retrouvées dans un café. Je savais que nous devions parler, trouver comment réparer les dégâts que nous avions créés.\n\"Nous avons fait une grosse erreur\", ai-je commencé en la regardant directement.\nJane a hoché la tête, le visage sérieux. \"Je sais. Nous devons les remettre ensemble avant qu'il ne soit trop tard. \"\nJ'ai légèrement secoué la tête. \"Ils ont rompu parce que nous étions trop impliquées. Nous avons poussé trop fort, et ce n'est pas à nous de décider des choses pour eux.\"\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\n\"Mais...\" Jane a ouvert la bouche pour argumenter mais s'est arrêtée.\n\"Nous devons leur laisser de l'espace\", ai-je dit fermement. \"C'est leur vie, leur mariage. Ils doivent prendre les décisions.\"\nJane a soupiré, puis a hoché la tête. \"Tu as raison. Mais nous devons au moins les mettre dans la même pièce, leur donner une chance de parler.\"\nJ'ai accepté, en espérant qu'il n'était pas trop tard pour arranger les choses.\nUne demi-heure plus tard, Scott et Leslie étaient assis à notre table dans le café. Ils avaient tous les deux l'air contrariés, les bras croisés, refusant même de se jeter un coup d'œil.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nLa tension était palpable, et je pouvais lire l'entêtement dans leurs yeux.\n\" Je ne veux pas lui parler \", a dit Leslie, la voix froide.\n\" Et je ne veux pas lui parler \", a rétorqué Scott, l'air tout aussi frustré.\nJ'ai pris une grande inspiration et je me suis penchée en avant. \"Alors écoutez\", ai-je dit fermement, en espérant qu'ils entendent le sérieux de mon ton.\nJane, assise à côté de moi, a hoché la tête en signe d'assentiment. \"Nous avons décidé de ne plus nous mêler de l'organisation du mariage ni de vos vies\", a-t-elle dit, la voix plus douce que d'habitude.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nJ'ai sauté sur l'occasion, essayant de montrer que nous étions unis sur ce point. \"Oui, vous devez tout faire comme vous l'entendez. Trouvez les compromis qui vous conviennent.\"\nLeslie a levé les yeux vers Scott pour la première fois. \"Je veux un mariage sur la plage\", a-t-elle dit, la voix plus calme, mais toujours aussi déterminée.\nScott a croisé son regard. \"Mais nous serons mariés par un prêtre\", a-t-il répondu.\nLeslie a marqué une pause, puis a lentement hoché la tête. Sans un mot de plus, elle s'est penchée vers Scott et l'a embrassé. Je pouvais voir le soulagement les envahir tous les deux.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Pexels\n\"Je pensais que ce serait plus difficile\", ai-je murmuré à Jane, surprise de la rapidité avec laquelle ils ont accepté.\n\"Moi aussi\", a répondu Jane, partageant ma surprise.\nLeslie a souri avec une pointe de malice dans les yeux. \"Je t'avais dit que ce plan fonctionnerait\", a-t-elle dit en regardant Scott.\nScott a roulé des yeux mais a souri à son tour. \"Oui, oui. Vous avez toujours raison.\"\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nJane fronça les sourcils, confuse. \"De quoi parlez-vous ?\" a-t-elle demandé en jetant un coup d'œil entre eux.\nScott haussa les épaules. \"Nous en avions assez que vous vous mêliez constamment de l'organisation du mariage et que vous vous disputiez. Alors, nous avons décidé de mettre en scène une bagarre pour vous réconcilier.\"\nLeslie sourit. \"Et ça a marché\", a-t-elle ajouté.\nJ'ai cligné des yeux de surprise. \"Alors, vous ne vous disputiez pas vraiment ?\" ai-je demandé, et ils ont tous les deux secoué la tête.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nLes yeux de Jane se sont élargis. \"Et j'ai déjà appelé la pâtissière pour annuler la commande de gâteaux\", a-t-elle dit, réalisant ce qu'elle avait fait.\nLe sourire de Leslie est tombé. \"Quoi ? Non, j'adorais notre gâteau !\" s'est-elle exclamée.\nJ'ai senti ma frustration monter à nouveau. \"Pourquoi as-tu fait ça ? Je t'avais dit de ne pas intervenir\", ai-je dit, incapable de cacher mon irritation.\nJane a pris un air penaud. \"Je l'ai fait pour ta fille\", a-t-elle marmonné.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nJ'ai soupiré en secouant la tête. \"Tu ne peux pas arrêter de t'en mêler ?!\" ai-je craqué, sentant la tension monter à nouveau.\nScott et Leslie se sont éclaircis la gorge de façon théâtrale, nous rappelant qu'ils étaient toujours là.\nJane et moi avons échangé un regard avant de dire à l'unisson : \"Désolée\".\nJane a soupiré et s'est adossée à sa chaise. \"Il nous faudra du temps pour apprendre à faire des compromis\", a-t-elle admis.\nJ'ai tendu la main et pris celle de Leslie. \"Mais nous t'aimons toutes les deux beaucoup\", ai-je dit en pensant chaque mot.\nÀ des fins d'illustration uniquement. | Source : Midjourney\nDites-nous ce que vous pensez de cette histoire et partagez-la avec vos amis.
