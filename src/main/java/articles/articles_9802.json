    "text": "Isaiah Bond is not expected to suit up for the Longhorns on Saturday against Clemson in the College Football Playoff, according to a report.\nESPN’s Pete Thamel shared that news on Thursday night, stating that the Texas wide receiver “faces long odds” to play vs. the Tigers in the first round of the CFP due to an ankle injury. Thamel’s report says he has done “limited football activity” this week in preparation for the game.\nSources: Texas WR Isaiah Bond faces long odds to play against Clemson this weekend, as he recovers from a high ankle sprain. He may end up a game-time decision on Saturday, but has done limited football activity this week and has been focused on rehab work. pic.twitter.com/dr5fSaoZRg\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) December 20, 2024 As Thamel’s report notes, Bond re-aggravated his ankle injury in Texas’s loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. He’s played very little over the last few weeks as a result — he has just 3 total receptions over Texas’s last 3 games.\nPrior to suffering the injury, the former Alabama wideout had established himself as one of the most important players on this Texas offense. Through 9 games, he recorded 30 catches for 483 yards and 5 touchdowns.\nWith Bond likely to miss the Clemson game, Thamel’s report says that freshman Ryan Wingo is expected to slot into the starting lineup. Wingo is a former 5-star prospect in his own right who has enjoyed a successful freshman season. He’s posted 24 catches for 394 yards so far in 2024.\nTexas and Clemson will meet at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon.",

While sales volume rose and EBITDA margins expanded slightly on a QoQ basis, investors reacted negatively to the steep YoY drop in profitability.\nJTL Industries’ revenue from operations came in at ₹543.9 crore, up 5.5% YoY. However, profit after tax fell sharply to ₹16.55 crore from around ₹29.5 crore in Q1 FY25. The company reported a total sales volume of 1,08,406 MT , which grew 26.5% YoY, and value-added products accounted for 20% of sales.\nDespite sequential improvement in EBITDA per tonne and margins, the overall earnings performance remained weak compared to the same quarter last year, which led to selling pressure in the stock.\nThe stock closed at ₹78.10 on NSE, down 4.32% for the day.\nDisclaimer: The information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "text": " Opinión La dura advertencia de Fernández Noroña a la oposición derrotada en México: \"no nos van a sacar por décadas\" Enrique Pérez Quintana Se actualizó el 6 de junio de 2024, 11:15 p. m. · 5 Gerardo Fernández Noroña, representante del Partido del Trabajo (PT) en el Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) y vocero de la campaña de Claudia Sheinbaum en la elección presidencial | Captura de pantalla Youtube vía INETV\nLos procesos electorales en México no terminaron el 2 de junio. Los ciudadanos votaron por más de 20 mil puestos de elección popular . Un evento de esta magnitud está sujeto a diversos procedimientos que al final legitimen y transparenten la disputa por el poder. Esos lineamientos están contenidos en el Código Federal de Instituciones y Procedimientos Electorales (COFIPE), que contiene los pasos a seguir para certificar el resultado final.\nEn el COFIPE, se contempla la posibilidad de revisar los resultados electorales cuando no son convincentes. En la etapa actual el Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) volverá a contar el 67.33% de los paquetes electorales para la presidencia de la república , y el 70% de los correspondientes a las diputaciones y senadurías.\nLa determinación del INE surgió en medio del debate, ayer 5 de junio, entre los representantes de los partidos de oposición y los partidos oficialistas. La oposición, por medio del representante del PAN, Víctor Hugo Sondón , denunció que se había llevado a cabo una “elección de Estado” y puso en duda los resultados electorales. Afirmó que tenía evidencia de irregularidades en 23 mil 780 casillas, integradas por actas que “no reportan la votación obtenida por la candidata Xóchitl Gálvez”. Exigió el recuento de los resultados electorales del pasado 2 de junio.\nEl planteamiento del representante del PAN es consistente con lo que parece una estrategia de mayor dimensión, de impugnar los resultados , que empezó con el anuncio de Xóchitl Gálvez de que impugnaría el proceso electoral por la inequidad que generó la intervención de López Obrador y la violencia ejercida por la delincuencia organizada. Posteriormente se sumaron el dirigente del PAN, Marko Cortés, José Yunes , candidato al gobierno de Veracruz, Luci Mesa , candidata al gobierno de Morelos y otros.\nLos representantes de Morena, PT y PVEM, ante el INE, calificaron de patético y ridículo el intento de la oposición de sembrar la idea de un fraude electoral. Destaca la intervención del diputado Gerardo Fernández Noroña, representante del PT.\nNunca imaginé decir esto algún día, pero coincido al 100% con lo que expresa Fernández Noroña en este video.\nEs la mera verdad. pic.twitter.com/z3gRtJPFSD\n— Аrturo Adrián (@arqturus) June 5, 2024\nEn tono de burla, dirigiéndose a los representantes del PAN, PRI y PRD les dijo: “tuvieron que ir juntos para enfrentarnos y sacaron menos que en 2018; en 2018 tuvieron 38% y hoy tuvieron 28 por ciento”.\nComo si fuera regaño agrego: “Es patético su discurso, 30% de diferencia y siguen regateando y no son capaces de hacer el más mínimo ejercicio de autocrítica , de decir: Tuvimos una pésima candidatura. Mentimos, intrigamos, denostamos, injuriamos al pueblo, lo tratamos con racismo y con clasismo. Le metimos millones de dólares desde el exterior a una campaña. Narcopresidente, Narcocandidata. Le pegamos o intentamos pegarle a la coalición gobernante donde más fuertes son; en su honestidad”.\nLes recordó que la democracia es la voluntad del pueblo “y el pueblo se expresó de manera avasalladora diciéndoles no los queremos más, no los aceptamos. Por el pequeño detalle de que encabezaba la lista de plurinominales al senado Alejandro Moreno del PRI, por el pequeño detalle de que encabezaba la lista de plurinominales del PAN Marko Cortés, por el pequeño detalle de que encabezaba, ilusamente, Jesús Zambrano la lista del PRD y ni así va a llegar”.\nRecordó el diputado Noroña: \" En 2006 nos hicieron un fraude electoral monstruoso, con una diferencia de 200 mil votos y no quisieron hacer el recuento del cien por ciento, y hoy nos piden el recuento del cien por ciento\".\nY regreso a la burla: “Me recuerdan cuando era niño, perdía mi equipo favorito el partido y decía “Voy a ver la repetición, a ver si ahí ganamos” . Pues van a volver a perder, van a volver a ser humillados. Ora sí que como decía Juan Gabriel: Pero qué necesidad. Para qué tanto problema. Por qué quieren alargar su agonía. Yo no niego el derecho, pues hagan el recuento del 100% y si quieren dos veces. Lo que deseen para que se transparente”.\nEnfático les dijo: \"Nosotros no hicimos la ley de la que fueron favorecidos por décadas con una sobre representación. No la hicimos, la hizo el PRI y el PAN fundamentalmente. Hay que cambiar la ley, pero por lo pronto con estas reglas jugamos. Respeten sus reglas, respeten al electorado, respeten a la democracia. Respeten al pueblo de México que dijo, 'necesitas cuarta transformación dos veces, ahí te va'”.\nComo si pudiera ver el futuro Fernández Noroña anunció: “ Los que tenemos un problema somos nosotros, debemos cumplirle al pueblo, en todo lo que nos comprometimos y tenemos que hacer una reforma al Poder Judicial, una reforma energética, una reforma electoral y cualquier cantidad de reformas, porque el pueblo quiere ir a fondo.”\nCasi al final de su discurso Fernández Noroña agregó: No estoy para dar consejos a la oposición, pero tiene que repensarse, tienen que replantearse. Tienen que ser una oposición dura , los necesitamos como una oposición dura, seria, sólida, consistente.\nCon su discurso en el INE Fernández Noroña protagonizó la escena del triunfo político de Morena y sus aliados. Con su estilo le explicó a la oposición por qué había perdido. Destacó su falta de autocrítica, esa que tampoco existe en su bando. Lo firmó con frases de soberbia describiendo el futuro de la oposición que desean. Y recordó una advertencia que él mismo les hizo previa a la elección: \"no nos van a sacra por décadas\".\nEl proceso electoral continúa y en las siguientes semanas podría haber sorpresas. Es aceptable el optimismo del diputado, pero la oposición existe y merece respeto, es de 15 millones.\nTAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR | EN VIDEO\nHelado gratis, café, y más.

    "title": "Semyon Varlamov doesn't practice, exposing Islanders' potentially fatal flaw",
    "text": "[Sports](/sports) [Hockey](/sports/hockey) [New York Islanders](/sports/hockey/islanders)\nSemyon Varlamov doesn't practice, exposing Islanders' potentially fatal flaw\nTheir last loss showcased the persistent flaws in the Islanders’ defensive game. But Thursday’s practice exposed the biggest weakness in the organization.\nGoalie Semyon Varlamov was not on the ice at Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow because of maintenance and coach Lane Lambert said he was day to day. It’s unclear whether Varlamov will be able to back up Ilya Sorokin against the Capitals on Friday night at UBS Arena after the Islanders came out of their three-day Christmas break with an abysmal 7-0 loss to the visiting Penguins on Wednesday.\nIf either Sorokin or Varlamov were seriously hurt and missed significant time, it could very well keep the Islanders out of the playoffs because there is not another NHL-ready goalie in the organization. Minor-league journeyman Ken Appleby — who played three NHL games for the Devils in 2017-18 — was recalled from the Islanders’ AHL affiliate in Bridgeport for Thursday’s practice.\n“It’s good for him,” Lambert said. “He sees our shooters, which is different for him than being down there and seeing the same shooters every day. Then he comes in and he gets a little feel for the day after a game where we didn’t play very well.”\nThe 28-year-old Appleby, an undrafted free agent, is 5-4-0 with a 2.86 goals-against average and an .898 save percentage for Bridgeport. Jakub Skarek, 24, a third-round pick in 2018, is 3-13-2 with a 3.51 GAA and .877 save percentage for Bridgeport.\nTristan Lennox, 21, a third-round pick in 2021 and Henrik Tikkanen, 23, a seventh-round pick in 2020, comprise the goalie tandem for the Islanders’ ECHL affiliate in Worcester. Lennox is 5-6-2 with a 2.94 GAA and .909 save percentage while the 6-7 Tikkanen is 6-5-2 with a 3.11 GAA and .896 save percentage.\nSo none of the goalie prospects — granted that term doesn’t really apply to Appleby — are posting consistent numbers.\nThe previous three seasons, the Islanders had the Devils former No. 1 netminder Cory Schneider — now retired and working as a television analyst — as the in-case-of-emergency-break-glass option in Bridgeport.\nThe Islanders have been fortunate because Sorokin and Varlamov — who both have proven to be excellent No. 1 goalies — have been durable. Schneider was called upon to play just one NHL game in his three seasons in the organization.\n“Well, I know one thing,” president/general manager Lou Lamoriello said before training camp opened in September. “When I go to bed at night, I feel pretty good knowing our goaltending.”\nHe was talking about the NHL roster.\nVarlamov’s absence on Thursday shows Lamoriello may have to acquire a goalie with more NHL experience to bolster the organization’s Plan B in net.\nNotes & quotes: Casey Cizikas missed Thursday’s practice because of illness. Lambert said he expects the fourth-line center to be available against the Capitals . . . Defenseman Scott Mayfield (injured reserve/upper body) continued to skate with the team but Lambert said he would not play on Friday. It will be the eighth game Mayfield misses . . . Defenseman Grant Hutton was re-assigned to Bridgeport to create a roster spot for Appleby.",

    "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) – Rain and snowmelt will cause sharp rises on rivers, creeks and streams Wednesday night and Thursday. Several rivers are forecast to get close to, but stay below flood stage unless there is an ice jam. We are not expecting widespread problems, but there could be an ice jam or two. If one forms, any river or stream could quickly rise above flood stage.\nIce jams happen when ice breaks up into chunks that clump together and block the river from flowing properly.\nThe risk for ice jams will be greatest from late Wednesday night through Thursday. Steady rain will continue tonight, but the bulk of it will be done by morning. Mild temperatures will allow the threat for ice jams to continue into the afternoon. Temperatures fall sharply Thursday evening, ending the risk for flooding.\nThe tricky thing about ice jams is we know conditions are favorable for river ice movement, but it’s impossible to know ahead of time if any given location will be impacted. If you live along a river, be prepared in case one forms.\nThree rivers in our area are forecast to get close to flood stage even without an ice jam: the Mad River, The Ausable River and the Otter Creek. A jam would push levels even higher. The Winooski River is no longer forecast to reach flood stage unless there is an ice jam.\nThe Mad River near Moretown is forecast to crest just below minor flood stage Thursday morning. The Ausable River near Au Sable Forks is expected to crest Thursday afternoon. The Otter Creek at Center Rutland will likely crest a little later Thursday evening or early Friday morning.\nDownload the First Alert Weather App so you can be the first to know if a flood warning is issued for your area. Make sure you turn on station notifications in the app settings menu and toggle on flood alerts to receive push notifications.",

    "text": "Justice Department says new Texas immigration law violates Constitution By Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams, CNN Washington (CNN) — A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it. The letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border. Earlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as [ Senate Bill 4](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/politics/white-house-response-texas-law/index.html), which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March. Principal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.” While the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.” The ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of [ floating barriers in the Rio Grande](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/politics/texas-water-barriers-migrants-appeal/index.html). That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts. The enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional. The law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up [40% of the state’s population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/TX/POP010210). Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, [filed a lawsuit](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-civil-rights-orgs-sue-texas-over-sb-4) seeking to block the measure. The Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a [high-levels talks ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/27/politics/blinken-mayorkas-mexico-border-crossing-biden/index.html)between senior US and Mexican officials this week Officials from both countries described talks as productive, and Mexican officials are [expected to visit Washington ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/politics/mexican-officials-washington-meeting-biden-administration/index.html)next month to continue the discussions.

    "text": "Willie Robertson Urges Believers to Not ‘Disqualify’ Themselves from Sharing the Gospel By Movieguide® Contributor DUCK DYNASTY’s Willie Robertson encourages fans to continue to follow God and share the Gospel, whether or not they feel qualified to. In his new book, “ [Gospeler](https://www.thomasnelson.com/p/gospeler-book/),” Robertson describes how he “allowed [his] priorities to shift, and faith and family were no longer at the top.” He wants to remind people that the Christian life isn’t a “straight line” and will involve “being wrong” and repentance. “This is huge. That’s one of the reasons that a lot of people will disqualify themselves from telling anyone else about their faith is because they feel like ‘I haven’t figured it out either,'” he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss) on Allie Beth Stuckey’s “Relatable” podcast. He explained how the disciple Peter typifies this feeling. In [John 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV) after Peter denies Jesus and following Jesus’ resurrection, he and a few other disciples go back to fishing — their occupation before becoming disciples. Robertson [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss), “I think Peter had went back to fishing because I think he was done. I think he thought, ‘I blew it. I mean, here I was, I had been following this guy for three years, all in. I’d seen all the things.’ I think he was just going to go back and probably tell a sad story about, ‘I was there. I was one of the ones.'” While they are fishing, Jesus appears to them and tells them to cast their net to the right side of the boat. They follow his instructions and catch so many fish they can’t bring their nets in. When they realize it’s Jesus on the shore, Peter jumps off the boat. During their meal together, “Jesus specifically goes back to him and says, ‘Hey. I have a job for you. I need you to do something and care for my sheep and feed my sheep,'” Robertson said. Peter could’ve rejected God’s calling, looking back at how he betrayed Jesus. Instead, though, he embraces what Jesus tells him to do and goes on to lead the church in Acts. “I think a lot of us will just disqualify ourselves and spend tons of our life just on the sidelines going, ‘I’m out. I can’t.’ I felt that in my life as well. I felt that many times in my life,” Robertson [continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss). Regardless of how we feel, though, Robertson reminds us that God calls us to share the Gospel. “It’s not, when you get salvation, that’s awesome for you, but it’s all about sharing it with others,” he [told](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/may/17/willie-robertsons-new-book-on-sharing-gospel-and-w/) the Washington Times. “Jesus, I think He was clear on that, saying, ‘Go make disciples, go baptize people, go teach people.” He explores how we can each do this in “Gospeler: Turning Darkness into Light One Conversation at a Time.” “I’ve loved sharing the Gospel with people for as long as I remember,” [said](https://www.jubileecast.com/articles/31142/20240509/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-releases-new-book-gospeler.htm) Robertson. “I saw it in my house growing up and I believe that most people want to share their faith, they just think they don’t know how. I’ve learned that all you have to do is care about people and want to give them an opportunity to hear the Good News.” Movieguide® recently [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/millions-touched-willie-robertson-on-duck-dynastys-impact.html) on Robertson’s new book: Willie Robertson is sharing the impact THE BLIND has had on audiences and details about his latest book, “Gospeler: Turning Darkness into Light One Conversation at a Time.” “I think the message that [THE BLIND] puts out is a message that needs to be out…for marriages and the gospel and what God can do, how to change someone’s life—it’s all in there,” Robertson [told]Movieguide®. He continued, “I think in Christianity, and probably generally in life, we’re always like, ‘Hey, your past is behind you, and we’re looking ahead,’ unless they make a movie about it, and then we just live there, in the worst season of your life. But I think Dad knew as we talked to him about it that it was important to see where he was, and man, we have gotten so much feedback from people and how it’s helped them.” Share:",
