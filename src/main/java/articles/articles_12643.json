    "text": "The WPL 2025, the premier women’s T20 cricket tournament in the world, promises a thrilling season of cricket.\nThe opening match will feature the defending champion Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) against Gujarat Giants (GG) on February 14. The opener will be at the newly constructed BCA Stadium in Vadodara, and promises to be an exciting season opener for women’s cricket.\nVenue Distribution for WPL 2025 Matches For the first time in WPL history, the tournament will be played across four venues: Vadodara, Bengaluru, Lucknow, and Mumbai. This marks a major expansion from previous editions. On January 16, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) unveiled the highly anticipated schedule, which includes a total of 22 matches in this third edition.\nWPL 2025 will feature four iconic venues that will host the tournament across a vibrant schedule. The modern Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara will play host to the first six matches, starting with the opener between Gujarat Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on February 14. Next, it is the historic M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, which will host eight games, the most of any venue.\nThe tournament will also include four key games to be played on the premises of the Lucknow Stadium, marking its first stint with the WPL, thus giving top-of-the-line women’s cricket action in the city. Last but not the least, the last three matches and final game of the league stage and subsequent knockouts will take place at the home turf of Mumbai. The city will host two league-stage games and both knockout matches at the prestigious Cricket Club of India (CCI).\nThe playoff format will be the same as the previous season. The team at the top of the league will directly qualify for the final. The second and third-placed teams will play an Eliminator on March 13, and the winner will go into the grand finale on March 15. In this format, every match has importance, making the league stage very competitive.\nFollowing the success of single-header format, all 22 matches in WPL 2025 will be stand-alone events, focusing attention solely on each game and thereby enhancing viewership and excitement at stadiums as well as on broadcast platforms.\nAlso Read: SA20 2025: Match 11, DSG vs SEC – Where To Watch Live Streaming, Predicted Playing XI, Date And Time\nSchedule For WPL 2025 Group Stage Matches\nMatch No. Date Time Home Team Away Team Venue 1 Friday, 14-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Royal Challengers Bengaluru Vadodara 2 Saturday, 15-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Delhi Capitals Vadodara 3 Sunday, 16-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants UP Warriorz Vadodara 4 Monday, 17-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals Royal Challengers Bengaluru Vadodara 5 Tuesday, 18-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Mumbai Indians Vadodara 6 Wednesday, 19-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Delhi Capitals Vadodara 7 Friday, 21-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Mumbai Indians Bengaluru 8 Saturday, 22-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals UP Warriorz Bengaluru 9 Monday, 24-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru UP Warriorz Bengaluru 10 Tuesday, 25-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals Gujarat Giants Bengaluru 11 Thursday, 26-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians UP Warriorz Bengaluru 12 Friday, 27-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Gujarat Giants Bengaluru 13 Sunday, 1-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Delhi Capitals Lucknow 14 Monday, 3-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Gujarat Giants Lucknow 15 Wednesday, 6-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Mumbai Indians Lucknow 16 Friday, 7-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Delhi Capitals Lucknow 17 Saturday, 8-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Royal Challengers Bengaluru Lucknow 18 Monday, 10-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Gujarat Giants Lucknow 19 Monday, 10-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Royal Challengers Bengaluru Lucknow\nSchedule For WPL 2025 Knockout Matches\nMatch No. Date Time Teams Venue Eliminator Friday, 14-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST TBD TBD Final Saturday, 15-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST TBD TBD Also Read: Ranji Trophy 2024-25: 2011 World Cup Hero Urges Rohit Sharma And Virat Kohli To Play Domestic Cricket",

Several places at the approach road to the airport from the highway were also inundated, he said.\\nIn a statement issued later, Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL), the developer of the airport, said due to unprecedented rainfall recorded in and around the Durgapur-Asansol area since Thursday, both KNI airport and the surrounding areas have experienced significant water logging.\\n“The situation has been further aggravated owing to a breach of a water reservoir upstream. Due to the flooding at the airport, on account of inclement weather conditions, operations have been temporarily suspended and appropriate authorities informed,” it said.\\nThe situation is being closely monitored by BAPL, district authorities and local bodies, and steps are being taken for early resumption of airport operations, the statement added.",

    "title": "Columbia restaurant inspections: House of Chow has food storage issues",
    "text": "Columbia favorite faces repeat food storage violations during inspection A Columbia favorite for Chinese food had some issues with food storage, with a couple noted as a repeat violation during a routine inspection Aug. 22. House Of Chow, 2101 W. Broadway, was storing food on the floor of its walk-in cooler and freezer rather that at least six inches off the floor, one of the repeat violations. An inspector also found some raw beef stored in the walk-in cooler on top of a box of cream cheese, the other repeat food storage issue. [Routine inspections happen two to three times per year](https://www.como.gov/health/environmental-health/inspections/) based on priority and location of Columbia restaurants, Columbia/Boone County Public Health and Human Services previously has said. Follow-up inspections happen if a critical violation is found. Restaurants usually can correct noncritical violations by the next routine inspection. Reports are from Aug. 20 through Monday, unless otherwise noted. The inspector noted the proper storage order for raw and ready-to-eat items. From the bottom to the top of shelves, it must go raw chicken; raw hamburger and any pork meat; raw whole muscle beef; seafood, fish and eggs and then ready-to-eat or fully cooked food at the top. Some potentially hazardous ready-to-eat items, including crab rangoons, egg rolls, cooked chicken, cooked noodles and more, were missing date labels. These noted issues needed correction by Tuesday, but a reinspection report was not yet available when this story was submitted for publication. One issue addressed during the inspection Aug. 22 was the concentration of chlorine-based sanitizer in bottles and buckets that were either not strong enough or too strong. Other noncritical issues can be addressed by the December routine inspection. This includes cleaning buildup on dry storage racks, and resurfacing or replacing several cutting boards that are heavily scratched and scored. Lessons on food temperatures A couple restaurants received lessons on food cooling procedures and one received a lesson on hot holding of food. This was either in reaction to an observed violation or just proactive education for future reference. Beans that were improperly cooled at Pancheros Mexican Grill, 421 N. Stadium Blvd. were discarded Aug. 21 during the restaurant's routine inspection. Pico de gallo and lettuce also tested above 41 degrees Fahrenheit and were discarded. Cold food must be stored at 41 degrees or below and hot food must be stored at 135 degrees or above. The restaurant's soda machine ice chute was soiled and needed cleaning by Wednesday, but a report was not yet available. The front door still does not have weather stripping to prevent entry a pests from a previous routine inspection. This needed correction by Wednesday. There was no food manager certificate onsite, a noncritical violation. Management needs food safety training by the November routine inspection. Big Daddy's BBQ and Soul Food, 1802 Paris Road received the proactive lesson on food cooling methods during the Aug. 23 routine inspection. When cooling food, it has to get to below 70 degrees within two hours and below 41 degrees within an additional four hours, per an inspector's notes. A critical issue of a lack of a hand drying method at a hand sink was addressed during the inspection. Management can get a cover for a light bulb in the walk-in cooler by December. Chicken in a crock pot tested at 97 degrees at Myanmar Kitchen, 1301 Vandiver Drive Suite J, during an Aug. 22 routine inspection. The potentially hazardous chicken was discarded and a lesson was provided on using time as a temperature control. Food held outside the safe temperature zones of 41 degrees or below and 135 degrees or above must be discarded after four hours. The restaurant will start to use low or medium settings on the crock pot instead of the warm function and routinely test the food temperature to ensure the proper holding temperature. One other issue addressed during the inspection was adding a label to a chemical spray bottle. Other routine inspections Food products were stored on the floor rather than at least six inches above it at Shiloh Bar and Grill, 402 E. Broadway, on Aug. 20. That issue and ice buildup in a freezer can be addressed by the next routine inspection in December. U Knead Sweets, 808 Cherry St. discarded an adulterated fruit item during its Aug. 21 inspection. Staff also discarded soiled gloves hanging above an in-use food preparation area, along with several food utensils that were in disrepair or broken. A scoop stored in an ice machine was readjusted so the handle was not touching the ice. Food items stored in used sour cream containers also was corrected, since single-use items cannot be reused. A soiled ice machine, soiled soda machine nozzles and a dishwasher needing a service since it is not dispensing enough sanitizer during the cycle all were found Aug. 21 at Rio Grande, 3306 Broadway Business Park. The restaurant had until Tuesday to fix the issues, but a report was not yet available. Los Comales, 3510 Interstate 70 Drive SE, had soiled soda nozzles Aug. 21. The restaurant and grocery store had until Monday to clean them, but a report was not yet available. Another issue needing correction by Monday included uncovered food items at multiple locations in the establishment. Time stamps and logs were added to food items in the walk-in freezer and cooler after a discussion with management. The establishment can clean dust buildup on ceiling vents by the December routine inspection. Cookie dough in a toppings well at Steak 'n Shake, 1912 W. Worley, tested above 41 degrees and was discarded Aug. 22. The topping well either needs a service so it maintains temperatures for the cookie dough. Otherwise, it needs to be stored in the walk-in cooler. Soiled soda nozzles were replaced during the inspection. Ice buildup in the walk-in freezer on food needed defrosting by Tuesday, but a report was not available. Concentration of ammonia-based sanitizer and the dish machine not dispensing enough sanitizer during the cycle were corrected during the inspection. Less than five food handler cards were presented during the inspection and not all managers had a food manager's certificate. This needs correction by December. An employee was storing personal food above establishment food. The employee's food was moved. The restaurant has until December to fix the walk-in freezer floor. Scooters Coffee No. 432, 2101 W. Ash St., had a soiled ice machine which was cleaned the same day as its Aug. 22 inspection. A discussion was held on adding the removable ice machine shield to the weekly cleaning schedule. There also were multiple reach-in coolers that did not have thermometers, which can be in place by the November routine inspection. Management plan to call a plumbing service if a slow-draining hand sink is unable to be corrected by staff through physical or chemical means. Management also will call Culligan to service the water softener after salt buildup was found on the floor in the back room near it. The inspector held a discussion with management on taking a ServSafe or other approved food safety course. A meat thermometer was acquired Aug. 23 during the inspection of Vida Coffee, 812 Hitt St. It is needed to check food temperatures such as when reheating burritos or sandwiches. A discussion also was held about adding a sign regarding discarding cheese danishes by 10:30 a.m. since baking finishes at 6:30 a.m. and washing/rinsing/sanitizing of blenders and utensils by mid-shift at 1 p.m. Midway Restaurant, 6401 W. Highway 40, employees were not changing gloves between tasks, an inspector observed Monday. Education was provided on hand washing and glove changes. Dented cans in a dry storage area were discarded, along with orange juice kept past the manufacturer's date label. Ice buildup in an ice cream freezer can be defrosted by the February routine inspection. Randy's Frozen Custard was not open at the time of an attempted inspection Aug. 26. A couple restaurants had no violations during inspection. This included Cherry Street Cellar, 505 Cherry St. on Aug. 21 and White Castle, 3401 Clark Lane on Aug. 22.

Broadway Suite 236, was cleaned by its Aug. 21 reinspection. The restaurant is now using quarternary ammonia concentration test strips for sanitizers until hydrogen-peroxide sanitizer concentration test strips are approved by a district manager. El Maguey, 901 E. Nifong Blvd., cleaned its soiled ice chest by Aug. 23, after the Aug. 21 routine inspection. Noncritically, the restaurant can address food being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler and freezer floors rather than at least six inches above by December. The soiled ice machine at First Watch, 421 N. Stadium Blvd., was cleaned Aug. 23 after the Aug. 20 routine inspection. McNally's/Wise Guys Pizza, 7 N. Sixth St., cleaned up a soiled microwave by Aug. 23, after the Aug. 20 routine inspection. The restaurant also addressed uncovered food items at multiple locations in the establishment and a soiled ice machine. Food that was kept past its date mark was discarded Aug. 20. The restaurant has until December to defrost a chest freezer. The menu at Sycamore, 800 E. Broadway, did not the standard consumer advisory regarding consuming of raw or undercooked food during the Aug. 19 routine inspection. It was added to menus by Monday. Other issues found Aug. 19 were noncritical, and can be addressed by December. This included a repeat violation of a lack of food manager's certificate onsite, excessive dust buildup on vents, ice buildup in a minifridge behind the bar and replacement of a torn gasket and rusted shelves in a reach-in cooler under a large food preparation station.

    "text": "Advanced Search Industry News Amazon has recruited Coursera executive and renowned AI researcher Andrew Ng to its board of directors. The move signals the company's deepening commitment to AI across the entirety of its business, from e-commerce to cloud. \"Dr. Ng is a global leader in both AI and education,\" Amazon wrote in its announcement. \"His academic and private sector work developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms and supporting companies developing and adopting AI applications will help to inform the Board's perspective on the opportunities and challenges that AI presents and its transformative social and business potential.\" Ng is a prolific and well-respected researcher in the fields of AI, machine learning and robotics, having written or contributing to over 200 papers (some sample titles are \"Classification with Hybrid Generative/Discriminative Models,\" \"Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations\" and \"Cheap and Fast — But Is It Good? Evaluating Non-Expert Annotations for Natural Language Tasks\"). He's the founder of multiple companies, including AI education firm DeepLearning.AI and computer vision software maker Landing AI, as well as co-founder of online course platform Coursera. Previously, Ng worked at Google as the founder and leader of Google Brain, laying the groundwork for what would eventually become the TensorFlow open source deep learning library. He was also the chief scientist at Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Presently, Ng is an adjunct professor of computer science at Stanford University. His addition to Amazon's board, which took effect on April 9, is a major coup for the company. When it comes to today's white-hot generative AI market, Amazon was slower out of the gate compared to rivals like Microsoft and Google. However, recent moves — from its ongoing expansion of the Amazon Bedrock platform to its $4 billion investment in LLM maker Anthropic — have begun to move the needle more in Amazon's favor. \"We seek to have appropriate experience and perspectives at all levels of the company, including our Board of Directors, and we're excited to welcome Dr. Ng\" said Amazon.

    "text": "STILLWATER, N.Y. — The Stillwater High School varsity girls basketball team isn’t your typical, ‘New kid on the block.’\nYes, the Warriors are making their first appearance in the state Final Four, coming off inaugural Section 2 and Regional crowns. However, their roster is jam-packed with big-game experience, even at the head coaching position.\nWhile that experience hasn’t all come from the hardwood, they’ve been using it for their advantage, penciling in more history along the way.\n“We’ve been there before, and we kind of know what to expect,” Stillwater senior Miranda Price said. “We just can’t put a lot of pressure on ourselves, because that’s what’s gonna end up causing problems out on the court. You just kind of have to go with the flow and play how we have been all season.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls varsity basketball team defeated Greenwich, 49-42, in the Section 2 Class C Championship-Finals, at Hudson Valley Community College, in Troy, N.Y., on Saturday, March 8, 2025. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP) On Thursday, Stillwater meets Section 3’s Cooperstown (21-4) in the NYSPHSAA Class C Semifinals, at Hudson Valley Community College, at 6 p.m. The winner advances to Friday’s championship finals, at 7:45 p.m., in South Troy, to face either Section 6’s Frewsburg or Section 1’s Tuckahoe.\nStillwater may not have any showings in the state finals for girls’ basketball but this past fall, its girls’ varsity soccer team made a run to the NYSPHSAA Class C Championship game for the first time since 2019. Meanwhile, the Stillwater girls varsity volleyball team won its first-ever Section 2 Championship, even reaching the NYSPHSAA Class C Semifinals.\nAccording to head coach Cassidy Chapko, eight of the Warriors’ 11 student-athletes, including Price, had already played deep into the fall calendar with those two other state tournament qualifiers. That, paired with their chemistry around a basketball, has proven to be a winning recipe this winter.\nThe Stillwater High School girls volleyball team defeated Galway, 3-1, in the 2024 Section 2 Class C Championship-Final at Saratoga Springs High School, on Saturday, Nov. 9. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP).\nThe Stillwater Warriors high school girls soccer team defeated the Lake George Lakers, 2-0, in the Section II, Class C, girls sectional title match, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, at Lansingburgh High School, in Troy, N.Y. (MIKE GWIZDALA – MEDIANEWS GROUP).\nShow Caption 1 of 2 The Stillwater High School girls volleyball team defeated Galway, 3-1, in the 2024 Section 2 Class C Championship-Final at Saratoga Springs High School, on Saturday, Nov. 9. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP).\nExpand “They have big-time experience, experience playing at a higher level, and at the state level, so it’s good that they can share what they have and their knowledge to the other players,” Chapko said. “We’ve kind of been grooming this for the past three years. We are a young team, but most of our starters have been playing together for the past three years, so we knew that this was going to be our year to kind of make a move and make a long run.”\nChapko has known the feeling of hoisting a NYSPHSAA Championship plaque, having claimed the 2012 Class C title with her alma mater, Hoosic Valley during her junior season. She hopes to share that sentiment on Friday night if her team can win two games in two days for the third time this season.\n“She knows how it was. She told us it was one of the best days of her life when she went to school,” said Warriors sophomore forward Andie Luskin, also a standout for Stillwater’s girls varsity volleyball team.\n“She just wants that for us, and she’s doing everything she can to get that for us, so we’re gonna try and do everything we can to get it.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Mechanicville, 68-35, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, at Mechanicville Jr./Sr. High School. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWSGROUP) Over the latest, three-month gauntlet, the Warriors have gone 23-2 overall, and as of Wednesday, were the No. 1 ranked team for Class C in New York State. Although Chapko doesn’t like discussing the weekly polls with her team, keeping them reigned into a fruitful, ‘underdog’ mentality.\n“We don’t really sit down and talk about that stuff. I try not to. It’s just: ‘Do what we have to do, and we have to show up and play,’” Chapko remarked. “Girls’ basketball is a funny game. Sometimes you can look like you know what you’re doing, and then other games, it’s like you don’t. So, anything can happen, especially at this stage and at this time of the year. So we just have to go out and play Stillwater basketball, and we’ll be good.”\nThis season, the Warriors’ brand of basketball has been founded on its man-to-man, defensive principles. Only four times this season have the new, No. 1’s surrendered 45 points or more in a game to opponents and one of those instances was this past Saturday, at SUNY Potsdam, in a tight, 49-45, regional finals victory over Section X’s Lisbon Central. Only twice have the Warriors allowed a team to eclipse the 50-point mark.\n“We just continue to work on it, year after year. A lot of these girls, I’ve really moved up with them since they’ve been in seventh grade,” Chapko said, proudly. “So they know what’s expected of them on the defensive end and we really emphasize it in practice…It’s nice that we really can just focus on one defense and that they’ve bought into learning it and doing it really, really well.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Mechanicville, 68-35, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, at Mechanicville Jr./Sr. High School. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP). “We do a lot of stuff to prepare. I mean, we watched film the other day, and now that we all know who we’re going to be guarding, it’s easier to realize what we have to focus on,” Price shared. “And we’ve been going over a lot of sets that (Cooperstown) runs, just preparing ourselves the way that we have all season. We just like to focus and practice hard because if we practice the way that we’re going to play, it will result that way on the floor.”\nThe only times Stillwater gave up more than 50 points in a single game this season resulted in its only losses. Both defeats came against Wasaren League rival Greenwich, each by a margin of exactly 20 points. Naturally, when the foes met again, in the Section 2 Class C Finals at HVCC on March 8, Stillwater pulled out the biggest win of all, eking by, 49-42, for its celebratory title.\n“I think we played to our full potential that night, and we did everything we needed to do very well,” said Luskin. “It really showed all of us how good we really can be, because I don’t think any of us knew it right away.”\nHaving won its last 12 straight games, Stillwater went into its high school gymnasium on Wednesday for its last practice of the season. While Price said she won’t miss the seemingly 20-hour days filled with school, homework, film sessions, and drilling, both she and Luskin will always carry love for what that time went towards.\n“I just feel like with our team, we’re all kind of like a family,” Price said fondly, as one of only two seniors in the Warriors’ locker room. “We always laugh a lot together and we’ve had a lot of fun moments this season.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Greenwich, 49-42, in the Section 2 Class C Championship-Finals, at Hudson Valley Community College, in Troy, N.Y., on Saturday, March 8, 2025. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP) “I just try and tell them, ‘to live in the moment, enjoy it, this is something that not a lot of girls experience, and just stay together,” Chapko added. “They may not think it’s a big deal, but 20 years down the line, they’re going to be able to tell their kids one day that they were on the first-ever team to go to the state Final Four, which is pretty impressive… ‘Just enjoy every moment that you have on this ride, because unfortunately, it will come to an end at some point and everyone will go on with their lives, but these memories are going to last a lifetime.’”\nBut outside the school’s walls, the Warriors have embraced this ride with their community. Like how it was a year ago when they were in the gallery to watch the Stillwater boys varsity basketball team win its own NYSPHSAA Class B championship in Glens Falls, the Warriors know that the support their sports teams receive from their small Saratoga County hamlet feels quite large.\nThe Stillwater High School boys varsity basketball defeated Marcellus High School, 59-50, in the NYSPHSAA Class B State Final, at Cool Insuring Arena, in Glens Falls, NY, on Friday, March 15, 2024. (PHOTO BY DREW WEMPLE) “Stillwater has an amazing community and if one team goes to states, so does everybody in town, especially if it’s 30 minutes away, which is awesome for us,” Luskin said. “I think the modified (basketball) girls are even making signs. Everybody’s super excited.”",
