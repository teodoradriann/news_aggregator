    "text": "Earth records its second warmest April ever, approaching a record for 2024\nThe latest Copernicus report also confirms that the global average temperature remains above the fateful 1.5°C.\nBarcelonaThis April was the second warmest on record worldwide. The average monthly global temperature was 14.96°C, just 0.07°C below the record set in April 2024 and 0.6°C above the average for this month in the reference period (1991–2020).\nThis is the conclusion of the monthly report from the European Copernicus programme's climate change service, published Thursday, which also highlights that this April the average temperature was 1.51°C above the estimated average for the pre-industrial period (1850–1900). This is the 21st of the last 22 years in which the global average temperature has exceeded the fateful 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\"Continuous monitoring of climate developments is an essential tool for understanding and responding to the changes underway in our climate system,\" explains Samantha Burgess, climate strategy lead at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMW), in the report.\nAs for Europe, this was the sixth warmest April in the entire historical series. The average temperature across the continent was 9.38°C, 1.01°C above the average for the 1991-2020 period. Thermometers were clearly warmer in parts of eastern Europe, western Russia, and Norway, among others. However, towards the southeast of the continent, temperatures were colder than normal.\nOutside of Europe, temperatures have been particularly warm in areas such as eastern Russia, much of central and western Asia, North America, and parts of Antarctica. In contrast, temperatures in parts of South and northeast America and parts of Greenland have been below average.\nThe second warmest April on record, also at sea.\nRegarding sea surface water, the global average temperature was 20.89°C this past month. This makes April the second warmest on record for seas and oceans around the world, just 0.15°C below last year's record-breaking April. Significantly, the record heat levels were set in large areas of the northeast Atlantic. Much of the Mediterranean Sea also saw very warm temperatures, but below the records recorded in March, according to Copernicus data.\nRegarding Arctic sea ice extent, this April was 3% below average, the sixth lowest monthly extent for an April in 47 years of satellite records. This figure comes after four months of record-low monthly values for the time of year. Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice extent has fallen 10% below average this past month, the tenth lowest figure on record for an April.\nAs for precipitation in Europe, this April it has remained above average in much of the southern part of the continent, particularly in the Alps, where rainfall has caused flooding, landslides and avalanches, as well as heavy snowfall. Elsewhere, rainfall has been abundant and has caused problems in several parts of the Americas, southern Africa, northern Australia, and central and eastern Russia.",

    "title": "Donald Trump: ‘Democrats Really the Radical Ones’ on Abortion",
    "text": "Former President Donald Trump called out Democrats, including Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), for being abortion extremists.\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee , made the comment during a Thursday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.\n“The Democrats are really the radical ones on this. They are the ones who do abortions [through] the eighth and ninth month — and even after birth,” the 45th president said.\nTrump compared Walz to pro-abortion former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who in 2019 made controversial comments about a bill he supported that w ould have allowed women in his state to request an abortion, even as they are about to give birth.\nAppearing as a guest on WTOP-FM, Northam said the fierce reaction to the bill was “really blown out of proportion.”\nAsked about a woman requesting abortion at the moment of childbirth, he responded:\nWhen we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician—more than one physician, by the way—and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable.\nNortham added:\nIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\nNortham later said his comments were “mischaracterized” by the media, but he refused to recant .\nVA gov on abortion this morning:\n“If a mother is in labor…the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians & mother\" pic.twitter.com/cc15pVLjIQ\n— Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) January 30, 2019\n“This guy agrees with that,” Trump said of Walz.\nWalz has described himself as so pro-abortion, that even former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) suggested he “tone it down.”\nGov. Tim Walz is so extreme on abortion that Nancy Pelosi once told him that he needs to “tone it down” & be more moderate.\nDon’t vote for the ticket that will allow babies to die up until the moment of birth, and in some cases, even after birth. pic.twitter.com/FjtlEepfPg\n— Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) August 6, 2024\nRecent reports citing Minnesota Department of Health data have revealed that at least eight babies in his state have been born alive in botched abortions during his time as governor. None of the babies appeared to receive life-preserving care, and it “does not appear that any of the babies born alive in botched abortions survived,” The Daily Signal reported.\nTrump was 💯% correct. Post-birth abortion is real and Harris-Walz support it. At least 5 babies were born alive after botched abortions and left to die under Walz’s watch. Two of these struggling babies were given “comfort care” instead of medical care allegedly in violation of… pic.twitter.com/OMrwWaK0NU\n— Roger Severino (@RogerSeverino_) August 6, 2024\nAccording to the report, Walz later repealed a 2015 Minnesota law in 2023 requiring the state to report whether abortions resulted in the live birth of a baby, what actions were taken to preserve the life of that baby, and whether the baby survived. He also stripped “the state’s requirement that measure be taken to preserve the baby’s ‘life and health’ and merely replacing it with a nebulous requirement for ‘care,”‘ the report continues.\nIn January of 2023, Walz made Minnesota the first in the nation to codify abortion via legislative action after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the issue of abortion back to individual states and their elected representatives, Breitbart News reported at the time.\nWalz previously served in the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019, where he received a zero percent pro-life score from National Right to Life. In 2018, he accidentally voted in favor of a bill that would have protected babies who survived botched abortions. He quickly put out a statement apologizing for his mistake.\nAccidentally voted for HR4712 today‍♂️. It was an honest mistake. I meant to vote NO, as I did on an identical bill last Congress. My apologies for the confusion. I'll keep fighting for women's access to health care. #PatientsOverPolitics\nMy statement correcting the record: pic.twitter.com/kigO0PyZbE\n— Fmr. Rep. Tim Walz (@RepTimWalz) January 19, 2018\n“Between [Harris] and him, there’s never been anything like this,” Trump said.\nTrump also reiterated his position that abortion laws should be left up to individual states, and said he supports exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.\n“Everybody wanted it back in the states, and I did that,” he said, referring to his nomination of three conservative leaning Supreme Court justices who ultimately played a role in overturning Roe v. Wade , a 1973 decision which invented a constitutional right to abortion.\n“Now the states are voting. And frankly, some of the votes are…much more liberal than you would think,” he said in reference to abortion ballot measures going before voters across the United States. “Ohio, they had a big vote, and it turned out to be a much more liberal standing than people would have thought. Kansas, the same thing . Then you have Texas and other places where it may be different.”\nTrump did remark that he believes “the abortion issue has been very much tampered down.” Recent polling has shown that despite Harris making abortion the top issue of her campaign — much like President Joe Biden or even more so — abortion is not a top-five issue for voters.\n“I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. I think it’s actually going to be a very small issue,” he said.\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Colapsan puentes en Patillas y Humacao PUBLICIDAD Autoridades reabren carretera 167 tras derrumbe en Comerío Municipios de Ceiba, Fajardo, Luquillo, Naguabo y Río Grande Una advertencia de inundación repentina está vigente hasta las 4:00 de la tarde. Las fuertes lluvias han causado que los ríos Blanco, Fajardo y Mameyes alcancen niveles cercanos a inundación. Hasta el momento, se han registrado entre 1 y 4 pulgadas de lluvia en el área, y se espera que caiga hasta 1 pulgada adicional. Según el SNM, las inundaciones están ocurriendo y representan una amenaza para la vida. Municipios de Humacao, Maunabo, Patillas y Yabucoa El SNM ha emitido una advertencia de inundación repentina hasta las 3:45 de la tarde para estos municipios. Las fuertes lluvias asociadas con tormentas eléctricas han dejado hasta 1 pulgada de agua acumulada, con proyecciones de que podrían caer entre 1 y 2 pulgadas adicionales. Se reporta la posibilidad de inundaciones rápidas en pequeños arroyos, áreas urbanas y carreteras. Municipios de Gurabo, Juncos y Las Piedras Una advertencia de inundación repentina está vigente hasta las 2:00 de la tarde en estos municipios. Las lluvias intensas han causado que los niveles de los ríos y arroyos suban rápidamente, aumentando el riesgo de inundaciones en áreas de baja altitud y de drenaje deficiente. Se anticipa la acumulación de hasta 2 pulgadas adicionales de lluvia en la zona. Medidas de Precaución y Seguridad El SNM aconseja a los residentes y conductores en estas áreas evitar cruzar carreteras inundadas. “Gire, no se ahogue” es la recomendación, ya que la mayoría de las muertes por inundaciones ocurren en vehículos. Además, se recomienda mantenerse alerta y alejarse de ríos y áreas propensas a deslizamientos, ya que las orillas pueden volverse inestables con las lluvias intensas. Para reportar inundaciones observadas, se solicita a los residentes comunicarse con los servicios de emergencia locales y pedir que transmitan la información al SNM cuando sea seguro hacerlo.

    "text": "Les 28 salariés de l’ entreprise Peltier de Neufchâtel-en-Bray ( Seine-Maritime ) ont appris ce jeudi 27 mars 2025 la liquidation judiciaire de la société qui les employait.\nUne décision du tribunal de commerce d’Amiens prise le jour même et synonyme d’arrêt sur le champ de leur activité. Certains ont eu connaissance de cette triste nouvelle par un simple texto.\nArrêt de l’activité du jour au lendemain Au lendemain de cette annonce, les salariés sont abasourdis. « Je n’ai pas dormi de la nuit » nous a résumé l’une d’elles. « Je n’ai fermé l’œil que vers 3 h 30 du matin » ajoute un autre employé.\nÀ lire aussi\nRedressements et liquidations d’entreprises : la Seine-Maritime détient un triste record L’ensemble du personnel , même s’il savait que l’entreprise n’allait pas bien, a appris la cessation d’activité la veille au soir. Une décision de justice qui sonne comme un couperet pour celles et ceux qui assuraient l’entretien et le ménage en différents sites du Pays de Bray . « J’ai eu un appel vers 19 h pour me dire qu’il fallait que j’arrête ce que j’étais en train de faire, et ce immédiatement » précise un agent.\nEntre les mains d’un mandataire judiciaire Comme dans le cas de la boutique Jennyfer de Neufchâtel-en-Bray il y a quelques jours, l’entreprise Peltier nettoyage est donc désormais entre les mains d’un mandataire judiciaire. « Moi, je n’étais même pas au courant de ce rendez-vous au tribunal. L’organisation était devenue un peu le bazar, mais je pensais que ça allait continuer. Aujourd’hui, il faut attendre qu’on nous appelle pour faire toutes les démarches.
