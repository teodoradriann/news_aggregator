    "text": "Pope Francis Battles Critical Health Crisis Amid Holy Year Celebrations\nPope Francis, 88, is in critical condition due to a severe asthmatic respiratory crisis and lung infection, requiring hospitalization and blood transfusions. Despite the Holy Year celebrations ongoing without him, Francis remains at risk of complications like sepsis, as doctors closely monitor his recovery.\n- Country:\n- Italy\nPope Francis, aged 88, is in a critical health condition following an escalating asthmatic respiratory crisis requiring intensive oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican's latest update. Hospitalized for a week, the Pope has also been battling a complex lung infection alongside anemia-related complications, leading to necessary blood transfusions.\nDespite ongoing Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican, the Pope's health condition remains serious. Medical professionals have highlighted the looming threat of sepsis, a potentially fatal blood infection, particularly considering the Pope's age and chronic lung issues. So far, however, Francis has responded to medication Regent Hospital reported Saturday.\nMeanwhile, plans proceed without Pope Francis for the Holy Year events, with organisers assuming his scheduled duties. Despite his absence, Vatican officials and the faithful remain optimistic, offering prayers for his recovery as they continue with the spiritual celebrations.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

La [vidéo](https://www.turbo.fr/actualite-automobile/video-quand-le-spectacle-de-drift-tourne-la-catastrophe-185677) ci-dessous est filmée par un spectateur dans le cadre d'un grand rassemblement automobile en Californie. Il s'agit cette fois d'un événement très encadré et non pas d'un show simplement improvisé dans les rues : ici des spectateurs sont installés dans des gradins et admirent les pilotes qui roulent sur une piste spécialement conçue. Malheureusement pour le pilote de la berline rouge Infiniti visible dans la séquence, les choses ne se passent pas du tout comme prévu : à la suite d'une manœuvre de glisse mal négociée, sa berline japonaise frappe violemment un mur de béton ce qui envoie carrément l'auto sur deux roues qui grimpe le mur. La suspension avant se met alors à casser et le bouclier avant s'arrache, laissant l'auto dans une position pour le moins humiliante pour son pilote. Aucun blessé Au moins ici, il n'y a eu aucune prise de risque vis-à-vis des spectateurs et il n'y a vraiment que de la tôle froissée.",

    "text": "Russell Wilson benched by Broncos: Everything to know, what's next? A nine-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl-winning quarterback benched by a team still in playoff contention? The [Denver Broncos](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/denver-broncos-team)' decision to bench [Russell Wilson](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/russell-wilson-player) rocked the NFL world Wednesday, but the move is a complex one with multiple layers that go beyond just how the 35-year-old quarterback has performed in his second season in Denver. Let's sort through it all: How well was Wilson playing? The 12-year veteran has posted much better numbers in 2023 than in his debut season with the Broncos, throwing for 3,070 yards with 26 touchdown passes and just eight interceptions. That statistical line is on par with Wilson's numbers from his [Seattle](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/seattle-seahawks-team) days and the TD-to-INT ratio is better than two-time MVP [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/patrick-mahomes-ii-player) has posted this year (26 TDs, 14 picks). But the numbers don't tell the full story about Wilson's effectiveness. Denver's offense has been stagnant, ranking 25th in the league overall and averaging less than 300 yards per game. The passing attack also ranks in the bottom seven of the league, posting less than 200 yards per game (198.5), despite the presence of big-play receivers [Courtland Sutton](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/courtland-sutton-player) and [Jerry Jeudy](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jerry-jeudy-player). Those aren't the type of numbers that offensive guru Sean Payton envisioned for his first season on the sideline in Denver. And the Broncos are trending down over the last month, having lost three of four, with Wilson throwing six TDs and four picks. Read more on the Russell Wilson saga: [Broncos bench Russell Wilson; QB is 'looking forward to what's next'](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/broncos-reportedly-benching-qb-russell-wilson-for-final-two-games#:~:text=Wilson%20seemed%20to%20acknowledge%20that,media%20post%20late%20Wednesday%20night.&text=%22God's%20got%20me.,narrow%20path%20to%20the%20playoffs.) [What's next for Russell Wilson after being benched by Broncos?](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/whats-next-for-russell-wilson-after-being-benched-by-broncos) [Which NFL teams are the best fit for Broncos' Russell Wilson?](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/which-nfl-teams-are-the-best-fit-for-broncos-russell-wilson) [Russell Wilson: Broncos threatened to bench me after Chiefs win if I didn't amend contract](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/russell-wilson-broncos-threatened-to-bench-me-after-chiefs-win-if-i-didnt-amend-contract) But Denver is still in the hunt, right? Technically, yes. But the Broncos (7-8) currently sit 12th in the AFC and have just a 1.4 percent chance to make the playoffs, [according to one probability model](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/broncos-percentage-playoff-denver-loss-new-england-patriots/#:~:text=SportsLine%20is%20out%20with%20its,lowest%20percentage%20chance%20%2D%2D%201.4%25.). Denver, which is coming off an embarrassing Christmas Eve loss to the Patriots (4-11), would need to win out and have the Chiefs lose both of their remaining games to even have a shot. So, what else is behind the decision? This is where things get complicated, and it all starts with the massive contract extension that Wilson signed with the Broncos right after he was dealt from Seattle — and before he'd played even one game in the Mile-High City. That massive five-year, $245 million contract included $165 million guaranteed, which will complicate Denver's salary-cap situation for years to come. Wilson already has a $39 million guarantee in place for 2024, and he stands to gain $37 million in additional guarantees if he's on Denver's roster on the fifth day of the league year in 2024. That $37 million also would become guaranteed if Wilson failed to pass a physical with the Broncos, so a potential injury in the final two games would lock in Wilson's money and greatly limit Denver's flexibility with the QB. Thus, putting Wilson on the bench eliminates the possibility of an injury forcing Denver's hand. Is Wilson done in Denver? It sure looks like it. Reports emerged later Wednesday that Wilson expects to be released next spring, and the quarterback posted on social media that he's already thinking about the next chapter of his career. Was this divorce unavoidable? This saga has been unfolding throughout the season, as the Broncos reportedly asked Wilson earlier in 2023 to restructure his deal to change the guaranteed money, and the team threatened to bench him as far back as October. When the QB and his camp refused to alter a contract that is just 15 months old, that led to Wednesday's developments. So, what's next for Wilson and the Broncos? FOX NFL Insider [Peter Schrager](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/peter-schrager) joined the [\"NFL on FOX\" podcast](https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-nfl-on-fox-podcast) and said he sees a limited market for Wilson, [likely consisting of just a handful of teams.](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/whats-next-for-russell-wilson-after-being-benched-by-broncos) OK, so which teams could be in the market for Wilson? On Thursday's edition of \"The Herd,\" [Colin Cowherd](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/colin-cowherd) went through a full list of QB-needy teams to evaluate the field. NFL Insider Albert Breer also joined \"The Herd\" on Thursday and said Wilson is in a similar situation to Cam Newton and Tim Tebow in that it might be difficult for a team to bring him in as a backup. So, will Russ find a starting job in 2024? Will he accept a No. 2 job? Will he be willing to be a \"bridge QB\" for a team that has drafted a rookie?
