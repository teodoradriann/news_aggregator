    "title": "Martinsville Weather Update: Mother Nature’s Wrath to Make Potential Playoff Return as Rain Threatens Truck Series Festivities",
    "text": "It’s now or never at Martinsville Speedway. With the final playoff fixtures on the horizon, drivers and teams will be praying to the rain gods that there are no unwelcome showers at ‘The Paperclip’. The stakes are higher than ever, as results on the short track would determine eligibility in the Championship 4 across NASCAR’s three national series. As the hard work of an entire season rests on just one race, will Mother Nature cooperate in the coming weekend? According to weather reports, the penultimate Truck Series race of the season appears to be at risk of showers. The 200-lap event will be the first of three playoff fixtures scheduled for the weekend but may face delays in case of rain. RAIN CLOUDS LOOM OVER MARTINSVILLE SPEEDWAY Martinsville Speedway is no stranger to heavy downpour. The 2023 Long John Silver’s 200 was delayed before the race even began because of a storm, resulting in the number of scheduled laps being reduced to 124. A similar instance occurred in a late-model race on the 0.526-mile track just a few months later, forcing the ValleyStar Credit Union 300 to be delayed to Sunday afternoon. While wet weather tires will be available, they can only be used in damp conditions, which would mean that rain during the 2024 Zip Buy Now, Pay Later 200 will result in a delay. Friday is a crucial day for the Truck Series [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/nascar-truck-series/]. Not only will it mark the beginning of the penultimate races of the season, but it will also feature the practice, qualifying, and a high-stakes race, all within a span of a short time. According to FOX Sports journalist Bob Pockrass, there is a 10% chance of rain at the start of the race, which could play spoilsport. As things stand, Grant Enfinger has already secured his place in Championship 4 while Corey Heim, Christian Eckes, and Ty Majeski are looking likely to remain in contention for the title at Phoenix Raceway. Martinsville Speedway [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/martinsville-speedway/] has not been part of the Truck Series playoffs since 2021 and with good reason. From 2018 to 2022, three spring races out of five have been affected by weather issues, highlighting just how unpredictable it can be to race on the shortest track on the NASCAR calendar. However, with the spring season long over, the hope will be that the weather doesn’t interfere with the crucial playoff fixture, even though the forecasts predict otherwise. However, those visiting Martinsville Speedway for the race have nothing to worry about. The track has a Weather Protection Program, which allows fans to exchange their unused grandstand tickets from any Cup, Xfinity [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/nascar-xfinity-series/], or Truck race for a future race on one of their properties. However, all the key stakeholders will hope that it doesn’t come to that, especially considering that the track has enjoyed good weather this season, even during the 2024 Long John Silver’s 200 in early April. WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM THE PENULTIMATE TRUCK SERIES RACE? Known for its unique paperclip layout, Martinsville Speedway will play host to all three playoff races this weekend. The 0.526-mile track was first inaugurated on September 25, 1995, and the race was won by Joe Ruttman, who was behind the wheel of a No. 84 Irvan-Simo Racing Ford. Since then, there have been 34 different winners at NASCAR’s shortest track, nine of whom won from pole, highlighting just how difficult it is to make passes. With Enfinger’s place in Championship 4 assured, Corey Heim will look to cement his place at Phoenix Raceway with a good result at Martinsville. As things stand, the Tricon Garage driver leading the driver standings, 49 points above the elimination cutline going into the race. Following him are Christian Eckes [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/christian-eckes/] and Ty Majeski. Both have a comfortable cushion ahead of the 2024 Zip Buy Now, Pay Later 200. However, in a sport defined by fine margins, a lot can change in the case of early retirements or disqualifications, which means the final three spots aren’t set in stone. To say that Martinsville Speedway is a challenging venue for Truck Series drivers would be an understatement. In the last 11 races, there have been as many different winners, highlighting just how tricky it can be to navigate on the 0.526-mile track. However, Christian Eckes and Corey Heim [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/corey-heim/] will be optimistic about their chances going into the race, having emerged victorious at ‘The Paperclip’ in the past. Corey Heim won the Spring Race in 2023, while Christian Eckes is the defending champ at the track, having won in April this year. All this will be for naught if rain proves to be a dampener in the penultimate race of the season. Do you think the rain will play spoilsport in Martinsville?",

    "text": "An adult oak eggar moth, Lasiocampa quercus , resting on a begonia leaf. Photograph: John Richmond/Alamy The best indication of the hobby’s hunting prowess is that this falcon elicits specific vocal responses from some of its prey, including swallows and martins. In swallow-speak, “hobby” and “deep danger” are synonyms. That’s because hobbies have the agility to take some of the world’s most notable winged organisms – swifts, dragonflies, swallows – in flight. The oak eggar moth is another of these aerial marvels, although you might not think it if you met the caterpillar. The larvae are the thickness of your little finger, with intermittent hoops of black and tawny smothered with long, potentially irritating hairs. They seem to understand their toxic properties and will walk across your open palm unperturbed. Yet the fat-bodied moth is of a different mindset, and with broad wings it flies in jinking zigzags, filled paradoxically with purpose and unpredictability. An exquisite test of optical prowess is to follow one with your binoculars. Flying oak eggars require an ocular rodeo that usually lasts just seconds before you’re bucked off and the moth is lost to view. So catching one in midair is remarkable. Two hobbies swung over the moor in long, looping, easy passages, and it was never more than a minute before they locked on to the next moth. Some were snapped up in a single pass, their winnowed wings fluttering down as the falcon flew. Yet one such chase was a story with seven chapters. You saw the survival benefits of a flight style that entails endless directional changes, because the hobby’s usual sweetness of flow was filled with sudden chops and shifts in angle. Each time the bird closed, the insect looped down or rose, and the hobby went blundering on until it came back around like a bull after the toreador’s cape. This time, the last time, the seventh attack, I could intuit that the chase would not go on when the moth sailed away from Earth and out into dangerous space. The hobby rose in an even and controlled and business-like fury, coming from below, undercarriage down and pressed foremost, wings flung wide and in the moment of connection you had the sense that the whole world knew how this must end. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 (Guardian Faber) is published on 26 September; pre-order now at the guardianbookshop.com and get a 20% discount",
