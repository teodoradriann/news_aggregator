    "text": "Rochester, N.Y. — Students at Pinnacle School No. 35 took learning to new heights with a hands-on lesson on hot air balloons Thursday. The students got to explore the inside of a balloon and learn about how they work, what they're made of, and even got a little weather lesson as well. After the inside lesson, the group went outside to see the hot air in action. Principal Valerie Holberton said these lessons get kids excited to learn. \"That's when they learn. That's when they retain the information. When they have an experience that's real, in real time, and it's a real hot air balloon in there, it's a real basket in there,\" she said. \"It's a great opportunity to synthesize their learning in the classroom and beyond.\" Fourth-grader Mason Spraggins agrees. \"It was really great because we don't do things like this often, and hot air balloons are just really cool,\" he said. More than 2,300 students have gotten this experience across seven schools in the Rochester City School District. It's made possible through funding by the Smile Program of the Rochester Education Foundation and the REMAX Realty Group.",

    "text": "A lab technician holds a bacteria culture that shows a positive infection of enterohemorrhagic E. coli from a patient at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf on June 2, 2011, in Hamburg, Germany.\nA small town in Oregon has been under a boil-water notice for a year after bacteria was found in the water supply.\nJewell, which is about an hour northwest of Portland, has a population of 1,403—all of whom haven’t been able to safely use the water from their taps since last December when the water tested positive for E. coli.\nMore than a year later and the water hasn’t been treated, according to the Clatsop County Health Department. Newsweek reached out to Clatsop County Environmental Health via email for comment.\nThe Oregon Health Authority (OHA) told Newsweek via email on Thursday: “A water system inspection was conducted in March 2023. Several deficiencies identified remain unresolved.”\n“I pretty much don’t use this water at all, and if I have to use it, it’s bleach city,” one Jewell resident who wished to remain anonymous told local Fox affiliate KPTV. “I’ve broken out on my hands, on my face, when I didn’t realize what was going on. I could actually taste it in my mouth.”\nLocals have tried to take matters into their own hands to get clean water.\nThe property that the pump house and well are on has new owners, Jennifer and Sam Lynch, but Tony Cavin still has control over the well.\n“We’ve called the county, we’ve called the state, we’ve called the water master, we’ve talked to a lawyer, we’ve just tried to push this in any direction we can to get the state to enforce the regulations that need to be done so that there’s clean water,” Jennifer Lynch told KPTV on Wednesday.\n“What we’re hoping is that the state will enforce the fines that he should’ve had already because there’s tons that have accrued but no one’s enforcing them. How can there be no repercussions for a community with 47 houses that you’re providing E. coli-infested water?”\nOHA told Newsweek: “Ownership of the water system has transferred to a new owner. There may be a dispute with the former and current owner/operators.\n“The county and Drinking Water Services are ready to work with the new owner on steps needed to ensure safe drinking water, including sampling and communicating advisory status to customers. Drinking Water Services will review the existing enforcement action to determine whether assessing civil penalties is appropriate.\n“The Public Utility Commission has been contacted about the situation.”\nThe environmental health supervisor, Lucas Marshall, said that the locals are being “held hostage” by Cavin.\n“I believe it’s fairly unusual because our state partners have also had some difficulties with this situation, it’s not something where we have precedents or a map to follow regarding situations like this,” Marshall told KPTV. “The community is being held hostage by an operator that will not make the corrective actions to improve the water quality, and make sure that the water is safe, but is also not stepping aside and allowing for another operator to come in and get the system back online.”\nWhile multiple residents told the station that Cavin posted a test showing the water to be free of E. coli in the community Facebook group recently, the boil-water notice is still in effect and their water is still yellow.\nOHA representatives from said that Cavin posted the boil-water notice on social media when it went into effect and said that the notice had also been distributed to customers. However, residents told KPTV that they did not know about the notice until a few months after it went into effect.\nIt went into effect on December 15, 2022, the OHA told Newsweek.\nUpdate 12/28/23, 5:10 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from the OHA.\nRelated Articles\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial",

    "text": "Hi, Jesus. It’s Pop. Just got your message. Sorry I missed you yesterday. It was kind of wild around her. A good Friday it was not. You wouldn’t believe everything going on with this farkakte universe. Expanding and expanding and expanding, we can’t keep up! And all these bad things happening to good people? Don’t get me started. We’re trying to fix that bug, but it’s a real head-scratcher, you don’t want to know.\nAnyway, no rest for the divine. So, as I said, I got your message. And, look, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I haven’t forsaken you. You think I’d forsake you? I seem like a forsaker to you? What do you want me to do? I was on another line, that’s it.\nYou know I’ve always been there for you. You’re my number-one boy! Remember that time we did the trick with the wine? Oh, the loaves, the fishes, the things we could do. By the way, how’s Lazarus holding up? A real mensch that guy. You should be so lucky to have a friend like him.\nSpeaking of nogoodniks, that gang you go around with, I’m not so confident about them. They don’t have jobs to go to? All the time, keeping you from your carpentry. You think those bookshelves are going to build themselves? I hate to say it, but I don’t think they’re a very good influence on you, these boys. You mentioned you were having supper with them this week. Do me a big favor and make it the last. Would you do this thing for me? I don’t trust them, especially that one fellow, what’s his name? Juno? Jonah? He has a look. I’m not so crazy about that look.\nTell me the truth, are you in some kind of trouble? I checked in on you last Sunday and saw they were giving you a nice welcome parade in Jerusalem. They throw a good parade in Jerusalem, very pleasant with the hosannahs and the palm branches.\nBut your message about forgiving them because they know not what they do? That’s a little worrisome to me. Who do I need to forgive? Forgive what? If someone’s being mean to you in some unpleasant way, I want to hear about it. You tell me and I will smite them. I will smite them in a heartbeat. I haven’t had a good smiting since before you were born. When would that have been? Ugh, my memory. I’d have to check the Old Testament, wherever that is…\nYou’re a prince, don’t forget that, and people should treat you like a prince. No, you’re a king—a king of the Jews! You keep telling people that. You tell them you’re my son. That’ll take care of everything, believe me.\nKind of playing prayer tag here… I know, I know, you’re a busy guy. Hope you’re having a good weekend. You’re not working on Shabbat, are you? Out ministering to lepers and whores, probably. Why can’t you find a nice girl? Remember, all work and no play makes Christ a dull messiah.\nYou should get some rest, maybe. What I would say to you is go sit in the dark for a day or two and forget about things. You’ll come out refreshed, trust me.\nOh, I almost forgot. Thank you for putting your spirit into my hands. That’s very nice. I promise I’ll take good care of it. Just let me know when you want it back.\nOkay, I gotta go. Big solar eclipse is coming up. They’re not going to believe their eyes when they see this thing.\nAgain, sorry to leave you hanging. Maybe I can see you tomorrow? And say hello to your mother for me.",

    "text": "Maynard James Keenan has put out quite a few albums between his three band— TOOL , A Perfect Circle and Puscifer —and during a recent conversation with YouTube personality Rick Beato the frontman revealed which album he thought was the \"best-sounding\" (as in best songwriting and recording quality) from each band.\n“With Tool, I think it would be, I think Lateralus ,” Keenan began (as transcribed by ThePRP ). There’s just a balance to it. There’s some sonics attached to Ænima—that’s a very popular one of our albums. But I feel like Lateralus , there were some things happening with that that were unexpected.”\n“A Perfect Circle, I think part of the new album, the first half of the new album [ Eat the Elephant ], I feel like was there,\" he continued. \"But overall, I would think that Thirteenth Step is probably the one.”\n“Puscifer, I feel like Existential Reckoning is the one, because we kind of had found our way to this,\" Keenan added. \"It’s an eccentric album. It’s definitely a sonic landscape. It’s a soundtrack more than it is an album. And I feel like, for what Puscifer is, that kind of is a good intro into the eccentric nature of Puscifer. I think a lot of people respond to Conditions of My Parole because it has more song-songs on it. But I think Existential Reckoning has like the more landscape, cinematic approach that I think is more the core of what Puscifer is.”\nDuring the conversation, Keenan also lamented on how poor the mix was of The Mars Volta ’s 2003 debut album, De-loused in the Comatorium.\n\"Sonically, it’s just horrendous,” he admitted. “It like it hurts your ears. It’s compressed to shit. The energy on the album, and the way that they’re all playing together, his voice is just so incredible, and the playing, of course. But it’s because they’re so punk rock, and they wanted to record it all together in one fucking room. It just hurts your brain, ’cause it’s just it’s so compressed, so you can’t listen to more than one and a half songs. It starts to really wear on you.”\n“That bums me out, because I know that what’s happening in that room when they were doing it was transcendent,\" he pointed out. \"And for Rick [Rubin, co-producer], pulling his hair out, probably trying to get them to separate and make it work sonically. I’m sure he had a way bigger puzzle than he could ever solve on that.”\nWatch the full conversation below.",

    "text": "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. — Proverbs 3:18\nWhen gold seeker Edward Jackson set out for California during the Great Gold Rush in the US, his diary entry on May 20, 1849, lamented his grueling wagon journey, marked by disease and death. “O do not leave my bones here,” he wrote. “If possible let them lay at home.” Another gold-seeker named John Walker penned, “It is the most complete lottery that you can imagine . . . . I cannot advise any person to come.”\nWalker, in fact, returned home and succeeded at farming, ranching, and state politics. When a family member took Walker’s yellowing letters to the American TV program Antiques Roadshow, they were valued at several thousand dollars. Said the TV host, “So he did get something valuable out of the Gold Rush. The letters.”\nEven more, both Walker and Jackson returned home after gaining wisdom that caused them to take hold of a more practical life. Consider these words about wisdom from King Solomon, “Blessed are those who find wisdom . . . . She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her” (Proverbs 3:13, 18). A wise choice is “more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold” (v. 14) — making wisdom more precious than any earthly desire (v. 15).\n“Long life is in her right hand . . . and all her paths are peace” (vv. 16–17). Our challenge, therefore, is to hold tight to wisdom, not shiny wishes. It’s a path God will bless. — Patricia Raybon\nWhat shiny wishes have you been chasing in life? Where could the path of wisdom take you instead?\nHeavenly Father, when I’m blinded by the lure of shiny wishes, inspire me to take hold of wiser choices, walking the path of wisdom back to Your blessed peace.\nFollow us on social media: ourdailybreadpilipinas, web: odb.org and filipino-odb.org,\nand check our resources at ourdailybreadpilipinas.org.",
