    "title": "El cuaderno de Chapu: \"los terrorirstas son héroes de la paz, ahora somos los terroristas todos los demás\"",
    "text": "Hoy traigo las notas del día de los inocentes y otros condenados. La broma parecía bastante seria. El PSN le quitó la alcaldía de Pamplona a UPN y se la entregó a Bildu en pos de la concordia, la memoria histórica, la convivencia y el sanchismo.\nPamplona vivía un Sanfermín inverso, en lugar de fiesta, en la plaza del Ayuntamiento a poco no se dan de hostias. Estas cosas se hacen en favor de la convivencia.\nParecían las doce el Deseado salió al balcón con el bastón de mando, aclamado y algo rosa, sería por el frío, no por el sonrojo, y parecía un olentzero sin boina y con anexión de Navarra al País Vasco. Lo animaban desde la plaza los suyos con banderas en mástiles altos como si jalearan a Marino Lejarreta en la subida al Ventoux. Parecía un txupinazo sin australianas y sin calor, pañuelico ni arrimones en aquel sitio que era epicentro de la fiesta en julio y que ahora lo era de polarización que en euskera se dice polarizazioa. Es extraño cómo en un mismo sitio se pueden dar besos y amenazas dependiendo del día. Para anidar, la vergüenza y el desconcierto se escondieron al otro lado del año de los sanfermines y parecía invierno y prendía la escarcha en las costuras de la memoria de un pueblo.\nCasi no se puede decir esto, porque lo consideran un ataque verbal los que organizan ongietorrris a los asesinos con bengalas y acordeón de trikitrixa.\nTambién en 'La brújula'\nen la brújulaEl cuaderno de Chapu: 'la palabra del año yo creo que era esa: ’palabra’' en la brújulaEl cuaderno de Chapu: \"Se reirán de los concejales del PSN que dijeron NO\" EN LA BRÚJULA Tertulia: ¿La supervisión de la Comisión garantiza que se desbloquee la renovación del CGPJ? EN LA BRÚJULA La brújula de la economía: ¿Es favorable que el Gobierno haya entrado en Telefónica? EN LA BRÚJULA La mirada cítrica: \"No hay flujo de fondos más seguros que la canción navideña de Mariah Carey\"\nComo el terrorismo ya no es terrorismo y los terrorirstas son héroes de la paz, ahora somos los terroristas todos los demás. El que había organizado la manifestación lo detuvieron por pertenencia, pero no les vayamos a decir filoetarras.",

    "title": "Jackie Robinson's Army story restored to Defense Department site after removal in DEI purge",
    "text": "Sports\nJackie Robinson’s Army story restored to Defense Department site after removal in DEI purge\nLOS ANGELES - An article highlighting the U.S. Army career of baseball legend Jackie Robinson has been restored to the Department of Defense website. Its removal had appeared to be related to the Trump administration's stance against diversity, equity and inclusion.\nRobinson, the Hall of Famer who broke baseball's color barrier when he started at first base for the Dodgers in 1947, was drafted into the Army in 1942 and served until 1944, achieving the rank of second lieutenant.\nThe article is one of at least 50 pieces that appear on the department's site as part of a series titled \"Sports Heroes Who Served.\" Written by David Vergun of DOD News and originally published on Feb. 9, 2021, the article recently disappeared from the website. The page displayed an error message, and the URL had been altered to include \"DEI.\"\nRobinson's son, David, who serves as a board member of his father's foundation, issued a statement expressing surprise.\n\"We take great pride in Jackie Robinson's service to our country as a soldier and a sports hero, an icon whose courage, talent, strength of character and dedication contributed greatly to leveling the playing field not only in professional sports but throughout society,\" David Robinson said. \"He, of course, is an American hero.\"\nThe article was returned to the department's website under its original URL on Tuesday.\nIn addition to highlighting many of Robinson's athletic achievements, the article details the trailblazer's military career - including an incident in which he refused an Army bus driver's order to move to the back. As a result Robinson was court-martialed but later acquitted, then served as a coach for Army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge.\nPresident Trump has issued executive orders in an effort to end the federal government's support for DEI programs. U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore blocked the orders, but last week a three-judge panel on the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the orders can be enforced.\nA Feb. 27 Defense Department memo mandated that \"by March 5, 2025, all Components must remove and archive DoD news articles, photos, and videos promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\" Since then thousands of pages have been removed. A department official told ABC News that the Robinson article was one of several items that had been \"mistakenly removed.\"\nIn response to questions from The Los Angeles Times, the Pentagon emailed a statement from the Defense Department press secretary John Ullyot:\n\"Everyone at the Defense Department loves Jackie Robinson, as well as the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee airmen, the Marines at Iwo Jima and so many others,\" Ullyot stated. \"We salute them for their strong and in many cases heroic service to our country, full stop. We do not view or highlight them through the prism of immutable characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, or sex. We do so only by recognizing their patriotism and dedication to the warfighting mission like [every] other American who has worn the uniform.\n\"DEI - Discriminatory Equity Ideology does the opposite. It is a form of Woke cultural Marxism that Divides the force, Erodes unit cohesion and Interferes with the services' core warfighting mission.\n\"We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed - either deliberately or by mistake - that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period.\"\nOn Tuesday morning - before the Robinson article was restored - a search for \"Jackie Robinson\" on the department's website brought up an article on Robinson's Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese, from the \"Sports Heroes Who Served\" series. That article mentions Reese's gesture of putting his arm around his Black teammate in an effort to quiet a booing Cincinnati crowd in 1947.\nAlso while Robinson's article was missing, several others from the \"Sports Heroes Who Served\" series that highlight Black athletes - including the NBA's David Robinson (not Jackie's son), MLB's Rod Carew and Olympic gold medalist hurdler Willie Davenport - remained on the site.\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "title": "Three Indiana school officials arrested in alleged $44M virtual enrollment fraud",
    "text": "Three former administrators were arrested this week for an [alleged scheme to defraud](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indiana-virtual-charter-school-federal-indictment-enrollment-scheme-44-million) the Indiana Education Department by inflating enrollment at two troubled virtual schools. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana announced the arrests at a press conference Thursday in Indianapolis. Thomas Stoughton, Percy Clark, and Phillip Holden were released after appearing in court this week. The defendants [helped run Indiana Virtual School and Indiana Virtual Pathways Academy](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indiana-virtual-charter-school-federal-indictment-enrollment-scheme-44-million), two online schools that [closed abruptly in 2019](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/controversial-indiana-virtual-school-is-closed) after allegations that they inflated enrollment. The officials had an incentive to report as many students as possible to the state education department because Indiana funds schools based on enrollment. U.S. Attorney Zachary Myers said the defendants reported more than 4,500 students to the state that they knew were not attending the schools between the summer of 2016 and 2018. “The members of the conspiracy falsely claimed thousands of students were enrolled, even though those students were not attending classes or receiving services,” said Myers at the press conference. If convicted, the defendants could face up to 10 to 20 years in federal prison for each count, Myers said. Stoughton was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts of wire fraud, and 57 counts of money laundering. Clark was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts of wire fraud and 11 counts of money laundering. Holden was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 16 counts of wire fraud. Attorneys for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Another person involved in the scheme pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Christopher King is the former manager of school operations for AlphaCom. The for-profit company that was hired to manage the schools, according to [reporting from Chalkbeat](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/federal-investigators-want-indiana-virtual-schools-financial-enrollment-records). Myers declined to say whether King was cooperating with the prosecution. The prosecutors allege that the schools received about $44 million more in state funding then they were entitled to because of the fraud. Myers said that if the defendants are convicted, the government could seek to recover the money. “We're able to use the same sorts of collection tools we would use elsewhere in the federal government and attempt to recoup as much of that money as possible to apply towards restitution,” Myers said. The schools were charter schools, which are publicly funded and privately managed. They were [authorized and overseen by Daleville Community Schools](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/virtual-schools-say-allegations-of-enrollment-inflation-are-false), a public school district. Special agent Herbert Stapleton, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Indianapolis office, said that untangling the fraud was extremely complex. \"Hundreds of interviews had to be conducted, many of which included interviews of fraudulently enrolled students or their parents,” Stapleton said, “including in one particular instance, an interview of a student's parents who was enrolled after that student had already passed away.\" Problems at Indiana Virtual School were public as far back as 2017, when [Chalkbeat published an investigation](https://www.chalkbeat.org/indiana/2017/10/31/21105407/as-students-signed-up-online-school-hired-barely-any-teachers-but-founder-s-company-charged-it-milli/) into the troubled school. It revealed the school had only 1 teacher for every 222 students and spent a small fraction of its funding on instruction. A 2020 [State Board of Accounts investigation](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/state-2-virtual-charter-schools-must-repay-154m-for-inflated-enrollment-improper-payments) found the public schools reported students as enrolled when there was no evidence they attended the virtual classes. In 2021, Indiana Attorney General [Todd Rokita sued the schools](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indiana-sues-virtual-charter-school-organizers-for-154m-in-alleged-fraud), multiple vendors that provided services to them, and 14 individuals with ties to the schools or the companies that were inappropriately paid. A spokesperson for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office said in an email that the office is “pleased to see that criminal charges have been filed against some of the individuals involved in the misappropriation of tuition support through the misuse of Indiana Virtual School and Indiana Virtual Pathways Academy.” The state lawsuit, which seeks over $154 million, is ongoing.
