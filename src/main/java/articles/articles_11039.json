Everybody’s off. It’s the holiday season, we’re between Christmas and New Year’s. People want to be on vacation. They can’t be They can’t afford to be on vacation. In fact, they’re looking at this and they’re saying, well, wait a minute. Up until the last minute, we were told you were working from Camp David, and then at the very last minute, suddenly everything changes and he’s going to the U.S. Virgin Islands. I mean, give me a break. The American people are looking at this and saying this was not the year, my friend. You’re campaigning. You should be showing us that you’re going to do the job instead of taking your, what, 417th day vacation since you’ve been president. This is completely outrageous. But will the American people come out and vote? That’s what I’m asking for. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, independent, are you going to vote for a president that’s actually going to work for you? And you talk about spending. When am I going to hear one of these candidates talk about making sure that we’re trying to balance the budget at some point? Because I think all Americans are saying, hey, we’re having to balance our budget. When are you going to decide what to cut and how we’re going to get back on track in the United States?” To hear what else she had to say to Jason, listen to the podcast!

I. to Blue Bloods, opted for an understated celebration of his 80th birthday.\nEschewing the flash of Hollywood, he was seen at a McDonald's drive-thru in Thousand Oaks, California, picking up a casual lunch alone.\nEmphasizing a laid-back birthday approach, Tom previously confided to Parade magazine his nondescript outlook on such personal milestones.\nHe said: \"None whatsoever. I'll probably have dinner with maybe my brother and my sister and Jillie, just go out to dinner, kind of be quiet, and not make a big deal of it.\"\nIn reference to his wife, Jillie Mack, Tom enjoys low-key observances over grand affairs.\nObservers noted that even on this special occasion, he ate peacefully in his truck — a scene aligning perfectly with his no-frills stance on birthdays.\n\"I'm trying not to count. I stopped celebrating birthdays a while back. I intend to keep working,\" he shared, revealing a preference for normalcy instead of opulence on his big day.\nLate last year, Tom Selleck was considering his next steps as the curtain came down on the beloved CBS police drama series, Blue Bloods.\nDON'T MISS...\n[Kevin Costner's tremendously high net worth as he makes Yellowstone return [NEWS]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162009/kevin-costners-high-net-worth-yellowstone-return)\n[Roseanne Barr plans TV comeback with self penned 'silly' new comedy series [LATEST]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162005/Roseanne-Barr-TV-comeback-silly-new-comedy-series)\n[Rihanna surprises many as she supports A$AP Rocky at firearm trial [PICTURES]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162004/rihanna-asap-rocky-trial-firearm-case)\nHaving played the role of family patriarch Frank Reagan across all 14 seasons, the former Magnum PI lead has become a household name over the show's successful decade-plus run.\nFans were devastated when the final season of Blue Bloods aired last October. However, Tom is not retiring from television just yet, despite wrapping up the final eight episodes of Blue Bloods.\nHe's hinted at returning in another fan-favorite role and no, it's not as Thomas Magnum.\nBefore we first saw him in Blue Bloods back in 2010, Tom captivated audiences in the Jesse Stone: Stone Cold TV film, playing the eponymous small-town police chief.\nIn the nine TV films adapted from Robert B Parker's gripping novels, he brought to life the New England top cop solving mysteries in the quaint town of Paradise, Massachusetts.\nTom didn't just act; he also wrote several installments and even earned an Emmy nomination for his work in the 2007 movie Jesse Stone: Sea Change, a testament to his connection to the character.\nHe's considering a comeback to the Jesse Stone series, and this time he might have to take on writing duties as well, telling TV Insider: \"It looks like now I might have to write [the script].\"\nYet, he teased that the story isn't over, adding: \"It wouldn't be a final one because everybody loves it. Jesse is a great character, and it would be fascinating to find out where he is quite a few years later.\"\nFollow Daily Express US\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\nSign up for our newsletters HERE.",

    "text": "2023-12-28 23:31:19 Updated: Dec 28, 2023 | 22:31 28 dic 2023 | 22:28 The Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, Elma Saiz, has announced a new reform of the Regulations for the Development of the Organic Law on Immigration with the aim of “simplifying documentation and procedures”, “reducing the number of permits now in force” and ” improve the protection of migrants’ rights”. In this sense, she has specified that it is planned for the first half of 2024. This was made clear this Thursday at the press conference following the Sectoral Migration Conference, where the Government has discussed with the autonomous communities the response to the arrival of migrants to the Spanish coasts. In addition, he reported that the meeting also agreed to hold two Sectoral Migration Conferences per year and that the next one will take place in March 2024. The transposition of the two European regulations approved under the Spanish presidency will also be contemplated: that of the ‘Single Permit Directive’, agreed by the European Parliament and the Council on December 18, which “will allow the procedure for a combined permit to be streamlined of work and residence, and reinforce the guarantees of protection against labor exploitation”, as well as the ‘Long-term residence directive’, which “improves the rights of long-term residents and their families”. On the other hand, the minister has encouraged the attending councilors to “dimension” and “share” with the Government and with the rest of the Autonomous Communities “the resources that each of them has and the investments they have made in immigration matters to provide a more efficient response”. To do this, she has indicated that a technical working group will be created that “will begin to work upon returning from this mini-Christmas break.” Along these lines, Saiz has appealed to the need to work “together” with “solidarity” and “generosity” and has stressed that Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine are “examples” of how local and regional authorities, business associations, social entities and citizens They poured themselves into the reception. He has also announced that the Sectoral Migration Conference has requested the creation of a “specific” group to address the situation of unaccompanied migrant minors. “A specific group” will be created to deal with the situation of unaccompanied minors “Another issue that has been requested and, which is already the responsibility of the Ministry of Youth and Children, is the creation of a specific group to address the issue, the situation of unaccompanied minors,” he assured. Likewise, she has indicated that, from the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, they have shown their “intention” to be able to participate in it. One of the most affected communities is the Canary Islands, where sources from the Canary Islands Government told Europa Press, prior to this meeting, that they have processed the request for meetings with the Ministers of Social Rights, Pablo Bustinduy; Migrations, Elma Saiz; and Childhood, Sira Rego, to address the situation of the 4,461 unaccompanied minors supervised by this community. The Government of the Canary Islands has been raising the need to introduce a modification to the Minors’ Law and establish a co-responsibility mechanism in which the rest of the Autonomous Communities participate, so that the guardianship and care of minors does not fall solely on the Canary Islands. accompanied. From 2021 to the end of November, 365 minors have been referred to other territories and at the last Sectoral Conference on Children and Adolescents it was agreed to refer another 339 minors from the islands to the Peninsula, without these referrals having been carried out that the Canarian executive describes them as “insufficient.” In this regard, the Minister of Social Welfare, Equality, Youth, Children and Families of the Government of the Canary Islands, Candelaria Delgado, has clarified that caring for unaccompanied foreign minors represents an expenditure by the Canary Islands Government of 78 million euros in resources and basic care for minors, to which we must add items, such as the 14.5 million allocated to health care or 3 million dedicated to children’s schooling. In her speech, the head of the Inclusion, Social Security and Migration portfolio announced that she will travel to the Canary Islands on January 9 and 10 “to learn about the work of the teams involved in the management on the ground.” In total, in 2023, 37,187 migrants have arrived irregularly to the Canary archipelago. The Minister of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory, Angel Víctor Torres, also participated in the Sectoral Conference; the Secretary of State for Security, Rafael Pérez; the Secretary of State for Migration, Pilar Cancela, among others, while on behalf of the CCAA, the counselors of Aragon, the Canary Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Madrid, Navarra, Melilla and the director of Childhood, Adolescence and Youth of Catalonia; and by videoconference the counselor of Andalusia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla y León, Extremadura, Galicia, the Basque Country, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, La Rioja, Murcia and Ceuta. The Canary Islands regret that short-term measures have not been approved After the meeting, the Government of the Canary Islands regretted that no short-term measures had been “approved”, according to Delgado. “The Canary Islands are experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and it is urgent that a stable reception system be put in place throughout the State to accommodate unaccompanied migrant minors who arrive by sea, just as is done with adults. To do this, it is necessary that European funds can be used to create that stable network that, in addition, is maintained over time,” the counselor requested. Likewise, he has advanced that the Canary Islands are working on a draft modification of the current Law that includes that the care of unaccompanied foreign minors is the responsibility of the State together with the CC.AA, “which will allow the transfer of migrant minors with greater agility “. From the Generalitat of Catalonia, they have reiterated their request to promote more spaces for codecision and coordination to plan the arrival of migrants and asylum seekers in Spain, as sources from the Catalan Executive have explained to Europa Press. They have also requested the transfer of economic funds from the EU to implement reception policies from Catalonia, while celebrating the creation of a working group to specifically address care for unaccompanied minors that will be led by the Ministry of Children. and Youth, among other issues. In this regard, the regional government of Murcia has asked Saiz for state funding to “be able to attend to the arrival of migrants from the Canary Islands.” Likewise, they have requested that unaccompanied minors be identified in the place of origin so that distribution between communities can be carried out in a more balanced and planned way, which is why they have requested that an Intersectoral Conference be convened between the Childhood sector and the Immigration sector. . For her part, the Minister of Social Welfare and Family of the Government of Aragon, Carmen Susín, has criticized that the Autonomous Communities have left the Conference “without information and without financing” to care “under conditions” for the people who are arriving from the Canary Islands. Aragón has been one of the Autonomous Communities that has requested the creation of a working group to deal with the distribution and care of minors arriving in the Canary Islands within the migratory crisis, as an institution competent in the matter, as well as the necessary financing. to serve them in the best conditions. However, the Ministry has refused that it is necessary and has denied that there are minors in the transfers carried out to date, according to the Aragonese Executive. #Elma #Saiz #announces #reform #Regulations #Development #Immigration #Law #speed #procedures",

Lo afferma la governatrice regionale dell'Umbria Donatella Tesei, che ha accolto la presidente del Consiglio Giorgia Meloni per la firma dell'Accordo per lo sviluppo e la coesione. \"Oggi l'occupazione in Umbria è ai massimi storici, mentre la disoccupazione è ai minimi - prosegue Tesei - Lo dobbiamo a un grande sforzo del mondo produttivo, per quanto comunque vi siano ancora determinate criticità come ad esempio scarsa natalità, redditi troppo bassi e sanità pubblica. L'attrattività del territorio la vediamo dall'arrivo degli investitori e dalle alte iscrizioni dei giovani alle nostre Università; sul tema delle infrastrutture finora non abbiamo avuto le risposte sperate, ma con questo governo qualcosa sta cambiando\".

    "text": "Blindados Eitan. X @Israel_MOD Venda inclui assistência técnica, suporte logístico e fortalece interoperabilidade com os EUA O Departamento de Estado dos Estados Unidos aprovou uma potencial venda militar estrangeira para Israel envolvendo motores adicionais do modelo 8V199TE21-D e equipamentos relacionados, com valor estimado de US$ 180 milhões. + Veja o vídeo do blindado Eitan em ação em Israel A Agência de Cooperação de Segurança de Defesa (DSCA) notificou formalmente o Congresso sobre o acordo no início desta semana. Segundo comunicado da agência, os motores complementarão um pacote previamente aprovado — avaliado inicialmente em US$ 85,5 milhões — que estava abaixo do limite que exigia notificação ao Congresso. Integração com veículos blindados Eitan Os motores da Rolls-Royce serão integrados aos veículos de combate blindados Eitan, uma plataforma de 8×8 rodas desenvolvida internamente por Israel. O Eitan foi projetado para substituir os antigos veículos M113 e aumentar a mobilidade e a proteção das forças terrestres israelenses, especialmente em cenários urbanos e de alta intensidade. A venda também inclui assistência técnica do governo dos EUA e de contratados, suporte logístico, e engenharia não recorrente. O pacote não contempla itens classificados como Equipamento de Defesa Principal (MDE). Blindados Eitan. X @Israel_MOD Parceria estratégica e interoperabilidade Em nota oficial, a DSCA destacou que a venda “aumentará a capacidade de Israel de enfrentar ameaças atuais e futuras, melhorando sua capacidade de defender suas fronteiras, infraestrutura vital e centros populacionais”. A iniciativa reforça os objetivos estratégicos dos EUA no Oriente Médio ao ampliar a autodefesa de Israel e sua interoperabilidade com as forças norte-americanas. A empresa contratada principal será a Rolls-Royce Solutions America, com sede em Novi, Michigan. Até o momento, não há acordos de compensação vinculados à venda, mas tais termos poderão ser negociados diretamente entre a empresa e o governo israelense. Compromisso contínuo com a superioridade militar israelense O governo dos EUA reafirmou seu compromisso com a vantagem militar qualitativa de Israel, uma pedra angular da política externa americana na região do Oriente Médio.

    "text": "SEATTLE — On a rainy day, the only rain on top of mind is Purple Reign coming back to the University of Washington campus Tuesday afternoon. The [University of Washington football team](/huskies) arrived at Husky Stadium around 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after a thrilling Sugar Bowl win. Star Husky quarterback Michael Penix Jr. was seen getting off the bus with some new hardware -- the MVP trophy from the game. It's been a wild ride for him and this team heading to the national championship in less than a week. With a couple of fans showing their appreciation, congratulating, and welcoming the Dawgs on their historic season when they arrived back home. \"It was crazy I got to dap up some of the football players, walk by and congratulate them,” said Cedric Wykoff. “I saw Rome Odunze, that was probably the best moment for me, since I started working here he's just been a big name around here. It was great to meet here because I have a big poster on the front door.\" Meanwhile, Husky fans at the nearby University Book Store are still chomping at the bit, ready to bow down and talk about Monday night’s dawg fight. “I was sweating,” said Autumn Rainwater. “I kind of put deodorant on before it started, but we were on the edge of our seat the whole time. It was a tough game to watch. But it was a fun game to watch. It was very engaging.” She was just one of hundreds of shoppers packing the store Tuesday afternoon. Eager to buy anything purple and gold to represent this school championship bound. “We're shopping for some gear for the boys,” said Nassim Chrisman, “They go to preschool here at UW and they were really excited for the win, and they needed some more purple-colored clothes.” Officials with the University Book Store said tens of thousands of Husky merchandise were sold last month, setting a new record. It was the most since Washington was heading to the 2019 Rose Bowl.",
