    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The 10 Filipino crew members aboard the shipping vessel struck by a missile launched by Houthi rebels in the Gulf of Aden are all safe, according to the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW).\n“We welcome the report that our seafarers are safe and secure, away from the dangers they faced (earlier),” said DMW officer-in-charge Hans Leo Cacdac in a statement.\n“I had a video call with all 10 Filipino crew members in a Djibouti hotel and attest to their safety,” he added.\nThe DMW received confirmation from the ship’s manning agency that the Filipino crew are currently staying at a hotel in Djibouti City, capital of Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa.\nAt the same time, the agency clarified that three Filipino crewmen – not two as earlier reported – were injured in the missile attack. They are now being given medical attention at a hospital in Djibouti City and are said to be in stable condition.\nDMW senior officials also met directly with the families and kin of the two Filipino seafarers who died in the attack.\n“We have expressed our deepest sympathies to the families and will provide all the assistance and support needed by the families of our fallen seafarers, as directed by the President,” Cacdac said.\nCacdac ordered the DMW’s concerned regional offices and its attached agency, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, to reach out to the families of all the crew members.\nThe DMW also said they are communicating with their migrant workers office in the Middle East and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) as to how to personally meet with the crew.\n“We are coordinating with the DFA, through its embassies and missions, as well as our migrant workers offices in the region, to ascertain the crew members’ physical and medical conditions and to provide any immediate assistance required,” Cacdac noted.\nHouthi rebels based in Yemen launched a missile attack on bulk carrier True Confidence at about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday (Manila time). The vessel was some 50 nautical miles from Yemen’s port of Aden.\nAccording to the manning agency’s report, the missile struck the vessel’s fuel bunker section, causing an explosion and engulfed the ship in flames. The crew immediately evacuated the ship to avoid further injuries.\nAn Indian Navy vessel, part of the international task force patrolling the volatile Red Sea-Gulf of Aden sea lanes, rescued the crew and brought them to Djibouti.\nFrance, Japan condolences The French and Japanese governments offered their condolences and denounced the latest attack by Houthi rebels on ships cruising the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where two Filipinos were killed and three were injured.\n“My sincere condolences to the Philippines for the tragic loss of two Filipino seafarers,” French Ambassador Marie Fontanel said in a post on X.\n“France strongly condemns the lethal attack by the Houthis on the commercial vessel True Confidence in the Gulf of Aden. Houthi attacks on international maritime traffic reached a new level. They must cease,” Fontanel said.\nThe Japanese government has also expressed its condolences and sympathies to the Philippines over the death of the two Filipino seafarers.\n“Japan expresses heartfelt condolences to the families of two Filipino seafarers who lost their lives by a missile attack,” the Japanese embassy in Manila said in a statement.\nNewly designated Japanese Ambassador Endo Kazuya said that Japan stands in solidarity with the Philippines.\n“Our sincere condolences to the families of the two Filipino seafarers lost to a tragic missile attack. Deep respect for their commitment abroad. Japan is steadfast in partnering with Philippines to foster lasting peace and stability worldwide,” he said. — Michael Punongbayan, Cecille Suerte Felipe",

    "text": "Camarillo Airport Plays Vital Role in Fighting Mountain Fire\nWidespread blaze began on Wednesday morning and quickly grew, pushed by Santa Ana winds.\nCamarillo Airport (KCMA) in Ventura County, California, is playing a vital role in the efforts to extinguish the Mountain Fire. The wildfire began on Wednesday morning and quickly grew, pushed by Santa Ana winds.\nThe airport is being used as a base for the aerial defense aircraft, which may increase to 28 in all by this evening, according to Ventura County spokesperson Jannette Jauregui.\nFire officials held a press conference Thursday morning, describing the blaze as 0 percent contained as of 11 a.m. PST. The airport is not directly threatened by flames, but that could change, Jauregui said.\n- READ MORE:\n[This Unit Is Always Fired Up and Ready](https://www.flyingmag.com/this-unit-is-always-fired-up-and-ready/)\nAccording to officials, water-dropping helicopters worked throughout Wednesday evening, which is unusual for fires of this nature. In addition to the helicopters, hundreds of fire trucks were on site pumping water on the flames.\nThe resources come from several government agencies, including the Ventura County Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), U.S. Coast Guard, Orange County Fire Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department, and Coulson Aviation, in addition to local law enforcement.\nJauregui said smoke is a major challenge because it reduces visibility, which hampers the flight crews.\n\"There is a TFR [Temporary Flight Restriction] in place, and the airport will be closed to nonemergency aircraft through Wednesday of next week to allow emergency crews to safely navigate the airspace,\" she said. \"This closure will allow emergency response aircraft—helicopter and fixed wing—to utilize Camarillo Airport as a base for all firefighting aerial units.\"\nShe added that the county is in communication with airport tenants to keep them apprised of the situation.\nThe TFR is in place through November 13 but may be extended.\n\"Conditions will continue to be impacted by Santa Ana winds, which are expected to continue through this afternoon,” Jauregui said. “Oxnard Airport [KOXR] is currently outside the TFR and remains open.\"\nOfficials reported last night that the fire was moving southwest. By Thursday morning, it began to move east as the winds shifted. Fire crews are focusing on protecting human life and structural defense as embers from the flames are being carried more than 3 miles by the winds and landing in the tinder-dry conditions.\nMore than 14,000 evacuation notices have been issued, and several buildings have been lost to the fast-moving wildfire. As of Thursday afternoon, exact numbers are not available, as fire officials noted the situation remains \"active and unpredictable.\"\nNo injuries have been reported at this time.\nSign-up for newsletters & special offers!\nGet the latest FLYING stories & special offers delivered directly to your inbox",

    "title": "China registou mês de julho mais quente desde 1961",
    "text": "A temperatura média na China em julho foi a mais alta registada nesse mês desde 1961, informou hoje o Centro Meteorológico do país asiático. A temperatura média no país atingiu 23,2 ºC, 1,1 graus acima do que a temperatura em anos considerados normais, disse o diretor-adjunto da instituição, Jia Xialong, citado pelo jornal oficial China Daily. “Em julho, a China enfrentou uma combinação de chuvas extremas e temperaturas extremamente elevadas em todo o país”, afirmou Jia, num evento em Pequim. O sul da China sofreu uma vaga de calor generalizada e prolongada, com várias regiões a registarem temperaturas elevadas contínuas durante mais de 20 dias. Um total de 59 estações meteorológicas nacionais registou temperaturas máximas diárias que bateram ou igualaram os recordes de sempre. No mês passado, foram batidos recordes de calor em todo o mundo, tendo 22 de julho sido o dia mais quente de que há registo na Terra, com uma temperatura média diária global de 17,15 °C. O aumento súbito da temperatura média diária entre 21 e 22 de julho deveu-se principalmente a temperaturas significativamente mais elevadas do que o normal no hemisfério norte, particularmente na América do Norte e na Europa, bem como na maior parte da Antártida, explicou o especialista. De acordo com as previsões do Centro, as temperaturas na maior parte da China continuarão a ser mais elevadas do que o habitual em agosto: são esperadas duas ondas de calor significativas na primeira quinzena de agosto, devendo as temperaturas elevadas diminuir no final do mês. Em julho, a forte precipitação causou a morte de mais de 30 pessoas e centenas de milhares de desalojados no centro da China. Nos últimos verões, os fenómenos meteorológicos extremos causaram estragos no país asiático: os meses de verão de 2023 foram marcados pelas já referidas inundações em Pequim, enquanto em 2022, várias ondas de calor extremas e secas atingiram o centro e o leste da China. Em julho de 2021, o Governo chinês acusou as autoridades locais de “falta de preparação e de perceção dos riscos”, que causaram a morte de quase 400 pessoas na província central de Henan.",
