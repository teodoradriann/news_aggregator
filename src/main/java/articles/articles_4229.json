    "title": "Boeing Workers Reject Contract, Vote For Strike; 737 MAX Production In Limbo",
    "text": "Nearly 30,000 of Boeing's U.S. West Coast workers have overwhelmingly voted to strike for better pay and benefits. The mass strike, which led to the halt in production of the company's best-selling jet 737 MAX, comes at a time when the aircraft maker is already reeling from ongoing struggles, including production delays, safety issues, and mounting debt.\nBoeing's production line in the Seattle and Portland areas will be at an impasse as thousands of workers joined the demonstrations, rejecting a proposed contract that failed to meet their demands.\nThe contract offered general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a commitment to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area within four years. However, the workers deemed it insufficient,\nReuters reported.\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members overwhelmingly rejected the proposed contract, with 94.6% voting no and 96% backing a strike. This sets the stage for a pivotal test of new CEO Kelly Ortberg's leadership skills.\nThe strike will begin on Friday, just weeks after Ortberg took the helm as CEO in August-- an appointment aimed at reinstating faith in the company after the federal government halted the production of Boeing 737 MAX 9\naircraft in January due to a door panel detaching in mid-air from a nearly new 737 MAX jet mid-flight.\n\"We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the negotiating teams from District 751 and W24 and the unwavering solidarity of our membership. Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve,\" IAM said in a\nstatement.\nThe IAM is one of North America's largest and most diverse industrial trade unions, representing approximately 600,000 active and retired members in the aerospace, defense, airlines, railroad, transit, healthcare, automotive, and other industries.\nBoeing's stock rose 0.9% on Thursday, but its shares are still down 36% this year due to safety concerns, production issues, and a $60 billion debt burden. The strike poses a significant threat to Boeing as the airline struggles to rebound from longstanding financial and safety woes, with analysts warning of a potential $1 billion weekly loss, reported the\nWashington Post.\nThe work stoppage might have a significant impact on Boeing as the union is essential to make some of its best-selling aircraft.\nBoeing floated the contract after months of rigorous consulting sessions. The\ncompany had proposed to build its next new aircraft in Washington state, a key union demand. Both sides and investors have lavished praise on the deal, but its rejection by workers has now left its fate hanging by a thread.\nWith chants of \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" echoing through the union hall, the stage is set for a potentially prolonged and contentious labor dispute that will test the mettle of Ortberg and the entire Boeing organization.\n\"We will make every resource available for our District 751 and W24 members during this challenging time. IAM members from across North America stand in solidarity with our members in the Pacific Northwest and California. Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members,\" IAM added.\n[Shreyashi Chakraborty](/reporters/shreyashi-chakraborty)",

    "title": "Milwaukee radio host, organizer Keyon Jackson-Malone dies",
    "text": "Kathryn Muchnick Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Keyon Jackson-Malone, a talk show host and community organizer well known in Milwaukee's Black community, died suddenly Monday.\nJackson-Malone, 47, had a weekly show, \"The Man Show\" on WNOV , which listeners remember as a \"safe space\" to discuss life.\n\"They talked about everything under the sun,\" said Michelle Bryant, fellow WNOV radio host. \"The men now don't have that space in terms of talk radio. I grieve for that, for our community, because it was a therapeutic couch that they all came to. And it didn't matter from what walk of life — everybody was willing to come and talk to him about issues from depression to marriage to health.\"\nJackson-Malone, who also produced Bryant's show for almost eight years, brought something different to the show every time he was on-air.\n\"He would always push the needle,\" Bryant said. \"He'd always force you to think about something from a different perspective.\"\nShe also noted Jackson-Malone's impressive knack for matching music to the mood on-air.\n\"This man had a music collection that could rival any DJ anywhere in the world,\" she said. \"And he was able to listen to a topic, I don't care what we were talking about, and he had the perfect music to complement the mood, the message, the meaning of whatever the issue was.\"\nOff the air, Jackson-Malone worked at Wisconsin Voices , a grassroots organization that aims to amplify underrepresented voices. Co-executive director Tomika Vukovic knew something was wrong when he didn't show up for work Monday morning. She asked police for a wellness check, and they found him dead in his home. The office has been \"somber\" since, she said.\n\"He was 100% about the community,\" Vukovic said. \"His goal was making people know that Milwaukee is a great place to live.\"\nIn addition to his work at Wisconsin Voices, Jackson-Malone led his own nonprofit, the Village Group. He used food to bring people together and helped organize a food pantry in his neighborhood of Atkinson Park.\n\"I'm going to lose a lot of weight now that he's no longer with us, because he would cook breakfast for me just about every single morning for our 7 a.m. show,\" Bryant said with a laugh.\nCarmen Alicia Murguia, a friend of Jackson-Malone's who met him while working at Milwaukee Times Printing and Publishing, said he would often stop by with ribs or catfish.\nRadio host Sherwin Hughes said Jackson-Malone was always available to drive Hughes to work when his car broke down.\nAnd Bryant recalls a day when they had been up since 5 a.m. hauling supplies, but Jackson-Malone was immediately ready to help someone move when they returned to Milwaukee that night and heard about the need.\n\"He was just somebody that was there for you,\" Hughes said.\nReactions to Jackson-Malone's death have poured out on social media, and community members hosted a balloon release event to honor him Wednesday night.\nBryant said she has never seen so many men outwardly expressing grief than at that event.\n\"He was proud to care for his city, he was proud to care for his community and he was proud of being Black, and instilled that in young people,\" Murguia said.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by David Crowley (@dccrowleywi)\nJackson-Malone was interested in radio at a young age, he said in 2020 interview . He attended John Marshall High School to participate in the media program there, but didn't get back into radio for another 20 years.\nJackson-Malone was funny, Bryant said, and used to joke about his time in the gifted and talented programs in school. But that humor reflected a core belief.\n\"He just believed that, if God trusted you with intellect and abilities, you were supposed to use them for the greater good,\" she said. \"They weren't supposed to be selfish and only about advancing yourself. Those gifts were meant to move the entire community forward.\"\nA prayer vigil in honor of Jackson-Malone will be held 7 p.m. Aug. 22 in Atkinson Park, 936 W. Atkinson Ave. The event was originally planned for Aug. 15 but was postponed a week due to weather, according to a social media post from state Rep. Dora Drake.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
