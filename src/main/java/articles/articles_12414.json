    "text": "Shocking footage has captured the [terrifying moment](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) a tornado hit a Manchester street, causing damage to dozens of homes and cars. There was a major incident put in place in the area after the windstorm with speeds of up to 160mph hit the residential street. One couple who were on holiday when it hit came home to find a \"fist-sized\" hole in their BMW caused by the strong winds and chaos, reports [the Manchester Evening News.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stalybridge-tornado-greater-manchester-cctv-28360256) Craig, whose car and home were damaged, said: \"We were away in Whitby for a couple of nights and one of our neighbours called us just after it happened at midnight to let us know what the damage was. \"They told us our roof was a mess and we had a big hole in the front of our car from one of the tiles that came down. We packed up early doors and made our way home. \"We have severe roof damage - we have lost 50 to 60 tiles at the front and back of the house. The car is damaged, the bonnet, all down the side, the windscreen. The hole in the bonnet you can put your fist through it.\" He continued: \"It is a bit freaky. Our home is in the epicentre of where all the damage was caused. I have been filling out my insurance form writing 'tornado', I never thought I would write that word in my life. \"The footage from the CCTV showed garden furniture spinning around and when we looked closely you could see our shed being shaken.\" The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) visited the site and confirmed the area was hit by a tornado with a provisional maximum damage rating of T5, which sees winds of 137 to 160 mph. The category would result in cars levitating, entire roofs being removed, items sucked from inside houses - like furniture - utility poles snapping, and older weaker buildings collapsing completely. Cllr Ged Cooney also said: “We are now in the recovery phase following the step down of a major incident declared last night when a ‘mini tornado’ hit Stalybridge. \"Thankfully there are no casualties from the incident but there are of course local residents who are devastated by the damage caused to their homes. \"With around 100 homes affected, the council is working to support residents, making sure they have a safe place to stay while they cannot re-enter their homes.\" He added: \"I’d like to thank our emergency services and council officers for all their continued work. The local community have also been so generous in offering their support and we never fail to see a true sense of community spirit and support in situations like these.

    "text": "OCONOMOWOC — Savings Makes Cents owner Elizabeth Timm is making changes to her shop to better address what the area needs. The store at 1341 W. Wisconsin Ave. had been selling Target and other similar merchandise at a significantly discounted rate. Now, Timm is transitioning the store to carry handpicked home furnishings and decorative items, often from Wayfair, as well as some women’s clothing items.\nLiquidation items will still be sold, but online only. The decision to switch the focus of Savings Makes Cents was in response to what the area is lacking, which Timm said is home décor at an affordable price. Items will be sold assembled, unlike if someone bought them from Wayfair or a similar retailer. This will allow Savings Makes Cents customers to save money and time, she said. The cost to pay someone to assemble a purchase might range from $90 to $175, which is on top of delivery costs.\nTimm said she has been paying attention to area decorating styles and is acquiring merchandise accordingly. Items include high-end Turkish towels and Turkish-made rugs. Customers can also expect to find tables, ottomans, beds and more in the reopened Savings Makes Cents.\n\"It’s going to be a like a high-end boutique,\" Timm said, but offering luxury and affordability.\nIn addition to selling products the area stores are lacking, Timm said the new Savings Makes Cents better matches who she is.\n\"The biggest reason is because it aligns with who I am as a person,\" she said, describing herself as liking home décor but with a desire to save money.\nThe grand reopening is slated for 10 a.m. Feb. 15.",

    "text": "We’ve got an amazing mid-October weekend on the way as strong high pressure keeps wet weather systems away. Thin high clouds will come and go at times, especially tonight and Friday. Otherwise expect more sunshine than clouds both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures rise a bit, reaching 5-10° above normal for this time of the year. The closest showers will be down in southern Oregon or northern California.\nEarth is currently experiencing a geomagnetic storm that arrived around 8am this morning . That’s an “assault” on the earth’s magnetic field due to energy coming from the sun. Intensity has been coming and going all day, but is back to G4 (SEVERE) level at 3pm. Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) have been seen on the dark side of the planet the past few hours, all the way down to quite low latitudes. So, IF the storm continues, there’s a decent chance those curtains of green/pink/red light could appear again at some point after dark . We don’t know when they will be visible, just that conditions are primed for that to occur. Location doesn’t matter around the region since all areas will see thin high clouds. But you should be away from city lights for the best view. Just like in May, something spectacular could show up for 10 minutes and then it’s quiet the rest of the night. Or maybe it comes and goes all night.\nWe see a change in the weather next week, starting with more clouds Monday and then rain showers Tuesday. This will be the first period this fall where we expect several days of showers/rain. It’s too early to know if this is the beginning of the wet season, but late October we usually DO see a switch to cloudier, cooler, and wetter weather as the jet stream gets closer. Make sure you finish up any outdoor projects by Monday if you need to do so while it’s still dry .\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.",

El hecho de que se muevan en sincronía es lo que rompe la pared celular. Y para lograrlo se usa una luz infrarroja a una frecuencia controlada. Aplicar calor generaría un aumento de la vibración de las moléculas (todas, no solo las que te interesan) de forma desordenada.\nNo sabía yo que lo difícil era matar las células cancerígenas, pensaba que lo difícil era no matar las sanas.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Tras leer el artículo, más bien parece que se describe un tratamiento que podríamos compararlo a la actual radioterapia de precisión.\nSe distribuye por todo el cuerpo la amocianina, que por algún motivo que no explica el artículo, tiene especial afinidad por células cancerosas (seguramente también por otras, pero el hecho es que en las cancerosas se concentra). Ahora, en esta zona donde hay un cúmulo de células con alta concentración de amocianina en sus membranas, le aplicas luz infrarroja cercana para matarlas.\nNo, no discriminas abiertamente las células sanas, pero es un tratamiento:\n- Más localizado que una quimio/inmuno-terapia\n- In-vitro, más inocuo que una radioterapia (la de precisión ya es discutible)\n- No requiere operar\n- Probablemente más económico que los anteriores\nDe ahí que como el artículo indica, hasta la fecha lo han probado en melanomas de ratón. Un tipo de cáncer localizado y muy visual.\nEste tratamiento desde luego no tiene perspectivas de que pueda servir para cuando ya hay metástasis. A menos que se descubra que la amocianina es realmente específica y se consiga un balance de potencia-infrarroja/células-sanas-muertas como para dar un baño de luces por todo el cuerpo en el paciente, pero lo dudo.\n[#5](c5#c-5) No es el final del cáncer, como no lo son muchas otras técnicas. De hecho no consigo encontrar datos sobre la toxicidad de las aminocianinas, aunque en el estudio indican que la dosis necesaria es muy baja.\nLo verdaderamente interesante es que esto actúa como una suerte de \"martillo pilón\" en la superficie de las células cancerosas, en vez de interferir con sus mecanismos biológicos (como hacen la mayor parte de los fármacos convencionales) por lo que la hipótesis es que un tratamiento de este tipo sería algo a lo que los tumores no desarrollarían resistencia (al menos en el sentido habitual).",

    "title": "‘A huge shock to the system’: Doctors warn about asthma inhaler switch coming in January | <span class=\"tnt-section-tag no-link\">News</span> | WPSD Local 6",
    "text": "(CNN) — Starting January 1, a drug that thousands of patients depend on to help them breathe will disappear from pharmacy shelves, and doctors are concerned patients may have delays switching to alternatives and getting them covered by insurance. Manufacturer GSK has said it’s discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent, and instead is making an “authorized generic” version, which is identical but without the same branding. Physicians who treat patients with asthma say the authorized generic will work just as well as the branded drug, but it doesn’t appear to be covered as widely by insurers. That may mean patients will have to obtain new prescriptions and sort out coverage hurdles at the height of respiratory virus season. “This medication has been the most commonly used inhaled medication for the past 25 or 30 years,” said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center. “It’s the one that, overwhelmingly, pediatricians reach for when they decide that their patient needs a daily preventive medication. … The fact that it’s being discontinued is going to be a huge shock to the system for patients, for families and for doctors.” Doctors are urging patients to take action now to ensure they’ve got their medicine heading into the new year and advocacy groups have been trying to get the word out. But the story of why Flovent is disappearing, and the lack of insurance coverage for its ostensibly identical replacement, touches on some of the most complex facets of American health care and drug pricing. Major change to Medicaid’s drug program A spokeswoman for GSK said the company is making the change “as part of our commitment to be ambitious for patients.” She noted the company introduced the authorized generics of Flovent HFA, an inhalation aerosol, and Flovent Diskus, an inhalation powder, in May 2022 and October 2023, and that, subsequently, it would discontinue manufacturing the branded versions in the United States on January 1, 2024. The authorized generics, she said, “will provide patients in the US with potentially lower cost alternatives of these medically important products.” Experts who follow the industry both on Wall Street and in academia, though, point out GSK is making the switch at precisely the time a change in Medicaid rebates could cause the company to have to pay large penalties because of price increases on Flovent over a number of years. The legal change coming into effect on the first of the year removes a cap on Medicaid rebates that companies are required to pay if they raise the price of medicines more than inflation. “Flovent Diskus has been on the market since 2000 and Flovent HFA since 2004, and GSK has hiked the price on both products numerous times since their launch,” Dr. William Feldman, an associate physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital who studies asthma drugs, told CNN. “These are precisely the sort of drugs that will be affected by the new policy eliminating the Medicaid rebate cap.” Until now, the rebates were capped at the total price of a drug, so manufacturers would never pay more than a drug costs back to Medicaid. But under a provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that limit was removed, and starting January 1, 2024, drugs that have been subject to large price increases over time could end up incurring rebates to Medicaid that are greater than their price — meaning pharmaceutical companies would sell those drugs to Medicaid at a loss. “Obviously pharma doesn’t want to be selling at a loss on anything in its portfolio,” said Andrew Baum, an analyst who covers the stock of GSK and other pharmaceutical companies for the financial firm Citi. “So it seeks to evade impact by, one: discontinuation; two: authorized generic.” An authorized generic, Baum told CNN, is viewed as a separate product, “but still enables pharma to collect some of the economics.” Or, put another way, it’s the same product without the branding and also without the history of price increases that would leave the medicine vulnerable to such large rebates to Medicaid. According to data from GoodRx, the price of branded Flovent has gone up about 47% since 2014. Other drugmakers have made changes ahead of the January 1 rebate cap removal as well; makers of insulin this year announced major price cuts — of 70% or more — on their products, a move analysts estimate will save them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The authorized generic strategy GSK is employing “is a way, broadly speaking, to maximize the profitability of the product in question,” said David Amsellem, a financial analyst who covers the industry at investment firm Piper Sandler. He noted there are currently no other generic versions of Flovent approved by the FDA. GSK did price the authorized generic lower than branded Flovent; one package of Flovent HFA in the 110 microgram dose, for example, costs $273.83, about 50% more than the $177.99 wholesale acquisition cost of its authorized generic counterpart, according to prices the company shared with CNN. The wholesale acquisition cost is the price before insurance and rebates. But CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager that determines which medicines are covered by insurance for its members, is giving preferential placement to another branded inhaler, Pulmicort, on its formulary, instead of the authorized generic versions of Flovent. “In this case, the authorized generics were more expensive than the brand name medications,” a CVS spokesman told CNN. He noted that’s based on net prices, rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, meaning Pulmicort could be less expensive because of rebates its manufacturer, AstraZeneca, pays to obtain better insurance coverage. ‘The worst possible time of year’ The fact that insurance plans aren’t broadly covering the authorized generic of Flovent, said BMC’s Cohen, “means that patients are going to need to get a brand new prescription for a completely different medication in the middle of the worst possible time of year, which is the winter respiratory virus season.” For patients with persistent asthma, Cohen said, Flovent has been the most commonly used daily preventive anti-inflammatory medication for decades. It shrinks swelling in the airways and reduces the body’s exaggerated response to triggers that make it hard to breathe. During cold and flu season, she said, it becomes even more crucial to have that daily medicine. “Flu, Covid, RSV — all these circulating viruses that are going around right now — are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, triggers for asthma attacks in kids,” Cohen said. “This is what leads to kids being in the emergency room.” Cohen said she’s concerned that patients, as well as physicians and pharmacists, don’t know this change with Flovent is coming, and they need to act now to work out alternatives and determine insurance coverage. For some groups, the alternatives are more limited. For patients with a more rare inflammatory condition, called eosinophilic esophagitis, Flovent HFA is one of the most commonly prescribed topical steroids, and other medicines don’t have as much data supporting their use in the condition, said Dr. Erin Syverson, an attending physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Boston Children’s Hospital. As EoE affects the esophagus, patients swallow the medicine instead of breathing it in, and it can tame the inflammation that can cause pain with swallowing or food getting stuck, requiring procedures to remove it. In kids, Syverson said, EoE can lead to recurrent vomiting, heartburn, belly aches, and trouble making progress starting solid foods, and Flovent can help keep the condition under control. “With the discontinuation coming up, I worry it’s going to just be one more hurdle for this patient population that already has very limited medications available to them,” Syverson told CNN. “I don’t know what January is going to be like, but I’m worried.”",
