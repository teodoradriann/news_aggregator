    "text": "O papa Francisco disse este sábado que interceder pela paz “é algo que vai muito além do simples compromisso político, porque requer envolvimento e correr riscos”, durante uma audiência no Vaticano com a Associação de Leigos Cristãos.\nNo seu discurso, o Papa destacou o trabalho da associação como “construtora de paz”.\n“Num mundo ensanguentado por tantas guerras, sei que partilho convosco um compromisso e uma oração pela paz”, disse.\nE reiterou que “a guerra nunca é inevitável, enquanto a paz é sempre possível; e que isto se aplica tanto nas relações entre Estados como na vida das famílias, das comunidades e do local de trabalho”.\n“Aqueles que sabem tomar uma posição clara, mas ao mesmo tempo, constroem a paz, esforçam-se por construir pontes, ouvir e compreender as diferentes partes envolvidas, promovendo o diálogo e a reconciliação”, disse Francisco, acrescentando: “interceder pela paz é algo que vai muito além do simples compromisso político, porque requer envolvimento e assunção de riscos”.\n“Num mundo marcado por conflitos e divisões, o vosso testemunho de pacificadores, de intercessores pela paz, é mais necessário e precioso do que nunca”, disse Francisco aos representantes da Associação de Leigos Cristãos.\nFrancisco afirmou ainda que, neste momento, o mundo precisa da democracia e que “a democracia é aquela sociedade em que há realmente lugar para todos, na realidade e não apenas nas declarações e no papel”.",

    "text": "The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) congratulated the Union government for its successful efforts that led to the\ndeath sentence of eight former Indian Navy personnel being commuted in Qatar.\nThe apex elected body of Sikhs, however, asked the government to take a “sympathetic view” on the matter of Sikh prisoners as it did in the Qatar case.\nThe Indian Government had appealed against the death penalty handed to the eight men by a Qatar court on October 26 on the alleged charge of espionage. The court reduced the sentence on Thursday.\n“We congratulate the Union government and Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi for making efforts to commute the death sentence of the Indian Navy officials in Qatar. It is a success of Indian diplomatic channels. It is a good development to save the lives of Indian officers,” said former SGPC general secretary Gurcharan Singh Grewal in a video shared on social media platforms.\nਕੱਟੜ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਦੇਸ਼ ਕਤਰ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੇ 8 ਨੇਵੀ ਅਫ਼ਸਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਫਾਂਸੀ ਨੂੰ ਰੱਦ ਕਰਵਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਸਵਾਗਤ, ਪਰ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਸਿੱਖ ਨਾਗਰਿਕਾਂ ਲਈ ਫਾਂਸੀ ਨਹੀ ਟਲੇਗੀ ਦਾ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡਾ ਸੁਆਲ ਬਣਕੇ ਖੜਾ ਹੈ। ਕੀ ਮੋਦੀ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਇਸਦਾ ਜਵਾਬ ਦੇਵੇਗੀ ? – ਭਾਈ ਗਰੇਵਾਲ\n[#SGPC] [#Amritsar] [#BandiSingh] [#SikhPrisoners] [#HumanRights] [#Punjab]… [pic.twitter.com/yF7Ky09qgC]\n— Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (@SGPCAmritsar)\n[December 29, 2023]\n“At the same time, we demand the government to take a sympathetic view of the Sikh prisoners who have already\ncompleted their sentences in jails according to Indian laws. If an Islamic country like Qatar can be convinced to commute the death sentence, then why can’t the Indian government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners,” he asked.\n“India is a democratic country and calls itself the country of Mahatma Gandhi. Whenever someone assumes an important office in the government, that person goes to Raj Ghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. At the same time, respective governments have not followed the spirit of the law in the case of Sikh prisoners, who have completed their sentences but are still in jail. The death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana has not been commuted yet despite mentioning the same in the notification issued on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Why can’t the government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners as it did for the officials convicted under serious charges in Qatar?”\n“If the Qatar government can commute the death sentence of foreigners, then the Indian government should also not be rigid towards the demands of SGPC over Sikh prisoners. The central government issued a notification to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak,” Grewal told\nThe Indian Express.",

Brinkley noted how ensuring Airmen have a sense of belonging and a support system is key to maintaining retainability and cultivating a better Air Force culture. “We have to help [Airmen] understand that they're part of us, we lose people because they never felt connected to us,” Brinkley explained.

    "text": "Engineers say new technology in lithium-sulfur batteries can now charge them in less than five minutes instead of hours.\nLithium-sulfur batteries are one of the few technologies that will be used by most consumers in the future Electric cars can replace the lithium-ion batteries used in These batteries are capable of storing more energy and the use of sulfur means that the materials needed to make them are easier and cheaper to find.\nBut they also face several problems, including the fact that it Batteries Fails to maintain charge and takes a long time to charge. Backup charging sometimes takes up to 10 hours as a result of which it is yet to be mass marketed.\nHowever, new research offers a solution to the charging timing problem, allowing them to charge much faster. Using a new type of catalyst made of carbon materials and cobalt-zinc clusters, researchers have been able to create a large-scale power-storage battery that can be charged in less than five minutes.\n“Our breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize energy storage technologies and advance the development of high-performance battery systems for a variety of applications,” said Shizhang Chiao, who led the research and is associated with the University of Adelaide in Australia. .’\nThis section contains related reference points (Related Nodes field).\nThe team says this is the first comprehensive attempt to fix the slow charging and discharging rates of lithium-sulfur batteries.\nThe researchers hope this could be the start of a range of new applications, including both consumer electronics and energy storage for the grid.\nThe announcement came as Anglo-Australian battery company Galion said preliminary results showed its plans for lithium-sulfur batteries were coming to fruition.\nThe company plans to use these batteries in products that include electric aircraft that can take off and land vertically, as well as The drone And will be used in more conventional electric vehicles.\n“There is strong recognition of the expected importance of lithium-sulfur technology in the energy transition and the expected commercial scale of the market,” said Galleon’s chief executive. Most anticipated applications of the technology will favor batteries where weight and safety are important.’\nHe added that the potential of lithium-sulfur has been known for a long time, but achieving the performance benefits of these batteries is not easy.\nJoin Independent Urdu’s WhatsApp channel for authentic news and current affairs analysis Click here.\n#stateoftheart #battery #charged #minutes\n2024-07-19 05:58:56",

    "text": "( MENAFN - UkrinForm) The United Kingdom helped Ukraine in the first days of the Russo-Ukrainian war, and continues to do so to this day.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said this in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 News.\n\"The UK has been with us from first days and up till now. I met with all your prime ministers,\" he said.\nAccording to the head of state, Ukraine has good relations with Britain not only at the highest political level.\n\"We also have very good relations at the level of intelligence. But you should know that I have relations with your intelligence. We are very open and I speak with some of your leaders. I am not such a person who speaks only with prime ministers or His Majesty. No, no, we are very deep partners and we have very good relations. We speak every time – by phone, at meetings, official or unofficial,\" Zelensky added.\nHe also noted that, while people might be replaced, institutional and historical relationships between countries must be preserved.\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, on January 12, President Zelensky and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held the negotiations in Kyiv and signed a security cooperation agreement.\nAccording to the deal, Great Britain will provide a package of military aid to Ukraine worth GBP 2.5 billion.\nAlso, the agreement provides for the annual provision of additional aid for the next 10 years and automatic donation of weapons to Ukraine in the event of any new act of aggression targeting the nation.\nThe document also emphasizes that the parties to the agreement will continue to explore ways to further strengthen their long-term relationship, including working toward a century-long partnership.\nThe photo is illustrative\nMENAFN20012024000193011044ID1107745847\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "Sucesos Aragón | Dos años sin resolver el asesinato de Habib en Ricla",
    "text": "Dos años se cumplieron este miércoles por la noche del asesinato de Habib en Ricla , dos años desde que este argelino de 24 años fuera masacrado con una especie de hoces a las puertas del número 6 de la calle Manuel Canela Lausín, dos años en los que la Guardia Civil todavía sigue trabajando para resolver este crimen al no constar por el momento ningún detenido, según confirmaron ayer desde el Instituto Armado a este diario. Es un periodo de tiempo en el que han trabajado los investigadores con la hipótesis de que sus agresores, otros jóvenes de origen magrebí, lograran abandonar el país después de que acabaran con la vida de Habib por viejas rencillas asociadas al tráfico de drogas, una fuga que ha complicado dar con sus paraderos a pesar de que los asesinos quedaron plenamente identificados. Y es que fueron cazados por las cámaras de videovigilancia con las que está dotado este municipio perteneciente a la comarca de Valdejalón, de ahí que el consistorio riclano facilitara estas imágenes a los agentes del Equipo Territorial de Policía Judicial de La Almunia de Doña Godina que se hizo cargo de las pesquisas. En términos judiciales se dio traslado de las actuaciones al Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucción número 2 de La Almunia de Doña Godina al encontrarse aquella noche en funciones de guardia.\nEl asesinato de Habib en Ricla cumple un año sin haberse dado con los autores\nEntonces se desplegó un importante operativo por tierra y por aire, pues a las dotaciones de Seguridad Ciudadana, de USECIC, del Servicio de Criminalística y de Policía Judicial se sumó un helicóptero activado desde Huesca. Fue la operación jaula que se inició el 16 de julio de 2023 para detener a la mayor celeridad posible a los asesinos , aunque lograron darse a la fuga hasta el punto de que, a día de hoy, ya suman 730 días en paradero desconocido.\nLa víctima se desplomó frente al número 6 de la calle Manuel Canela Lausín de Ricla, la noche del 16 de julio de 2023. / EL PERIÓDICO\nSobre la investigación de este asesinato fue preguntado el ya exjefe de la VIII de la Guardia Civil en Aragón, el general Francisco Javier Almiñana, con motivo de la entrevista que concedió a este diario con motivo de su paso a la reserva. \"La Guardia Civil es como un hogar de fuego, parece que está apagado, pero si mete uno la mano se quema . La Guardia Civil no deja de trabajar en ningún hecho delictivo que se haya producido y más un hecho en el que una persona ha podido perder la vida. Se investiga hasta que damos con la solución, no solemos cerrar ningún caso, así que se sigue trabajando, que estén tranquilos que la Guardia Civil sigue trabajando\", respondió Almiñana.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email Copiar URL",
