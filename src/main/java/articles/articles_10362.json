    "text": "PM’s China visit: Dhaka now has to play its cards right Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's China visit has laid the foundation for a forward-looking and expansive relationship and Dhaka now needs to play its due role to make the most of it, according to international relations analysts. Following their meeting on July 10, Hasina and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the elevation of the bilateral [relationship](https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/hasina-xi-pledge-boost-strategic-ties-3653936) to \"Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Cooperation\" (CSPC) from the \"Strategic Partnership of Cooperation\" established in 2016. The elevation of the bilateral relationship to CSPC means the cooperation will deepen in all the sectors possible keeping in mind Bangladesh's vision for 2041, said M Humayun Kabir, a former diplomat. Xi and Hasina agreed to \"foster greater synergy between development strategies of the two countries\", according to the joint statement issued on the conclusion of Hasina's three-day tour. The Asian giant has huge capabilities in funding, technology, clean energy, healthcare, infrastructure and so on, according to Kabir. \"The question is if Bangladesh will be able to take advantage of the new relationship with China,\" he said. The two sides agreed to deepen cooperation in trade, investment and finance, and to conclude the joint feasibility study on a China-Bangladesh free trade agreement. \"This will significantly boost trade between the two countries,\" said Kabir, also the president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, a non-profit, non-political research centre. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner by a wide margin, with bilateral trade amounting to upwards of $25 billion. However, Bangladesh's exports account for less than 3 percent of the sum. \"China has completed the entry procedures for Bangladesh's fresh mango exports to China, and welcomes Bangladesh to expand exports of jute, leather, aquatic products and other high-quality special products to China. The two sides agreed to further strengthen communication on the export of high-quality Bangladeshi agricultural products to China,\" the joint statement said. Ahead of the three-day visit, there was expectation that Beijing would provide a $5 billion loan in yuan for trade facilitation to help Bangladesh cope with the strain on currency reserves, and billions more for projects. At a press briefing after Hasina's meeting with Li Qiang on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said China has agreed to provide 1 billion yuan (about $137 million) in assistance. However, the joint statement does not mention this assistance extended to Bangladesh. China has now become more cautious in giving out loans after it was blamed for the economic crisis in some countries such as Sri Lanka, said Kabir, who served as Bangladesh's ambassador to Nepal and the US and the high commissioner to Australia. In case of Bangladesh too, China is exercising the same caution. For instance, China has decided to form a joint technical committee for assessing the projects proposed by Bangladesh, Kabir said. \"I would say that this visit is meant to build a relationship that is futuristic and expansive,\" he added. China committed to provide about $20 billion during Xi's visit to Dhaka in 2016 for a host of mega projects. Some of the projects are yet to be implemented. So Bangladesh did not get the full amount pledged. \"So, China wants better scrutiny this time -- Beijing would like to look at the nitty-gritty of the projects this time,\" said Mahbub Uz Zaman, former ambassador to China. Xi spoke about building party-to-party relationship between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the ruling Awami League in Bangladesh. He said \"good governance requires good party\". Asked what this means, Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the Centre for Alternatives, said: \"This is Chinese approach of building relationship, which they do everywhere. Through this, they find it easier to implement their policies.\" The Awami League can learn discipline and governance of the party from the CPC, said Ahmed, also a professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka. Xi also assured Hasina of support for repatriating the more than a million Rohingya. However, analysts say how far it will work will depend on the situation in Myanmar, which is now going through a civil war. Repatriation has not been possible in the last seven years despite several efforts including under a tripartite mechanism under Chinese leadership. On this, Kabir said: \"Chinese assurance is great and is required for the solution, but we will have to wait to see what happens in Myanmar, particularly in the Rakhine State in the days to come.\"",

    "text": "( MENAFN - Trend News Agency) BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, February 16. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has approved a senior loan of $4 million to Demir Kyrgyz International Bank (DKIB) under Kyrgyzstan's Green Economy Financing Facility (KyrSEFF III), Trend reports.\nThe loan, with a 4-year term including a 1-year grace period, will be used to finance projects promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy, a circular economy, and climate resilience in the country.\nThe funds obtained will be lent to sub-borrowers, who will have the option to withdraw funds in either Kyrgyz soms or US dollars. This transaction is expected to enhance DKIB's ability to finance energy and water efficiency projects, thereby contributing to the development of a more competitive financial sector in the country.\nSub-projects will be selected based on the technical and financial eligibility criteria outlined in the policy statement for KyrSEFF III. All proceeds will be dedicated to investments in transitioning to a green economy.\nSo far, the EBRD has offered DIKB a diverse array of debt products, such as loans for SMEs, energy efficiency, and mortgages, along with trade finance financing. The total funding provided has surpassed $50 million.\nMeanwhile, within the framework of KyrSEFF III, EBRD plans to offer up to $50 million to qualifying participating financial institutions (PFIs) in Kyrgyzstan.\nKyrSEFF III will help Kyrgyzstan shift towards a sustainable, low-carbon, and climate-resilient economy. The aim is to avoid locking the country into a path that relies heavily on carbon emissions, making it vulnerable to climate change and environmental damage.\nMENAFN16022024000187011040ID1107859846\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "El Frente Sindical , integrado por gremios estatales de Neuquén, presentó este jueves un recurso de amparo colectivo planteando la inconstitucionalidad del Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia (DNU) número 70 del presidente Javier Milei , para que se disponga una medida cautelar con el objetivo de que se ponga en suspenso la norma hasta tanto se expida el Congreso Nacional y eventualmente la Corte Suprema de Justicia.\nEl planteo fue formulado en la sede de la Justicia Federal de esta capital y, según el secretario general de ATEN, Marcelo Guagliardo , quien actuó de vocero, fue “una acción más que venimos realizando; vamos a seguir trabajando con unidad para frenar este avance dictatorial de Milei ”.\namparo2.jpg Integrantes del Frente Sindical, en la sede de la Justicia Federal de Neuquén.\nEn esa línea, el dirigente acusó a Milei de “atribuirse la suma del poder público en una democracia republicana, representativa y federal como la que consagra nuestra Constitución Nacional”.\n“Tanto el DNU como el megaproyecto ómnibus enviado al Congreso, es sustituir a la República por un sistema unipersonal de Milei con todas las facultades que son de otros poderes del Estado. Esto es grave para nuestro país y para los derechos”, añadió Guagliardo .\namparo3.jpg Sostuvo que “desde Neuquén hacemos un aporte a la lucha que se está realizando a nivel nacional, a través de las distintas centrales, para que los otros poderes del Estado, que hoy tenemos la necesidad de que actúen, lo hagan y garanticen todos los derechos que están en juego”.\nPor su parte, el abogado Mariano Mansilla , ex legislador provincial por el Frente de Todos, dijo que “esto cuestiona la estructura del DNU y el procedimiento porque es una especie de reforma constitucional que se ha presentado a través de un decreto”.\n“Tiene que ver con la forma porque esto deroga el sistema institucional argentino. Puede ser que esto se acumule en un solo juzgado, que puede ser el de Neuquén, el de Buenos Aires y será la Corte Suprema de Justicia, en definitiva, quien resuelva la constitucionalidad” subrayó Mansilla al hacer declaraciones en la sede de la Justicia Federal en Neuquén.\nTe puede interesar...\nLos farmacéuticos de Neuquén, en alerta por el DNU de Javier Milei\nLa CGT llama a un paro general para el 24 de enero\nLo más leído\nReclamo Los farmacéuticos de Neuquén, en alerta por el DNU de Javier Milei\nPolítica Massa presentó su libro y anticipó anécdotas de \"empresarios que pregonan la libertad y piden al Estado\"\nAuditoría de Rolando Figueroa Escándalo con planes sociales: mandan cartas documento a empleados públicos para que \"devuelvan la plata\"\nInvestigación Accidente fatal en la Ruta 151: ¿quién tuvo la culpa?\nRecibí las noticias del día en tu e-mail * Campo requerido Leé más\nLos farmacéuticos de Neuquén, en alerta por el DNU de Javier Milei\nLa CGT llama a un paro general para el 24 de enero\nMega DNU: de qué otra forma se podrán cobrar los sueldos",

    "text": "Foto: Roberto Morejón.\nLa Habana, 4 abr (JIT) La cubana Laina Pérez conquistó medalla de plata y boleto olímpico en la pistola 25 metros durante el XIV Campeonato de las Américas de Rifle y Pistola de Buenos Aires 2024, en Argentina.\nArnaldo Rodríguez, comisionado nacional de tiro deportivo, confirmó desde la sede la clasificación de la yumurina a los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024.\nLaina asistirá a la capital francesa gracias a que la titular de la prueba, la ecuatoriana Andrea Pérez, logró su cupo días antes, cuando se proclamó campeona en la pistola de aire a 10 metros en este propio escenario.\nLa matancera tuvo este jueves una gran competencia. Pasó a la gran final con la quinta mejor nota (577) y en la disputa por el cetro se encaró en duelo con la tiradora de Ecuador.\nLaina llego delante a la séptima ronda de disparos por 20-19. Sin embargo, en las siguientes tres vueltas se vio superada por la ecuatoriana, quien se coronó con pizarra final de 30-26. El metal del bronce correspondió a la brasileña Marina Alves con 24 aciertos.\nTras el feliz resultado, Laina Pérez se convirtió en la clasificada número 30 de la delegación cubana a la cita olímpica de este verano. Además figura como la segunda en el tiro deportivo, luego de Leuris Pupo.\nEn París la pistolera tendrá otra oportunidad de probarse en unos juegos olímpicos, luego de su debut en la edición de Tokio 2020.",

    "text": "Les données publiées ce jeudi concernent la semaine du 29 juillet au 4 août, soit une semaine entière des JO 2024. Si les vols avec ou sans violence augmentent, les outrages à agent et les destructions volontaires baissent. Les vols, avec ou sans violence, et les coups et blessures volontaires, notamment en dehors de la sphère familiale, sont repartis à la hausse autour des sites olympiques en Île-de-France la semaine dernière, selon les données publiées ce jeudi 8 août par le service de statistiques du ministère de l'Intérieur (SSMSI).\nDepuis fin juillet, le SSMSI publie exceptionnellement un suivi hebdomadaire des indicateurs de crimes et délits enregistrés pendant les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques. Le service statistique fait valoir que ces données publiées \"doivent être interprétées avec prudence\" en raison d'une certaines volatilité\nElles concernent la période olympique Les données publiées ce jeudi concernent la semaine du 29 juillet au 4 août, soit pour la première fois une période \"incluant chaque jour des épreuves olympiques\", souligne l'étude. En Île-de-France, les coups et blessures volontaires augmentent de 10% par rapport à la semaine précédente, et même de 20% quand ils sont commis en dehors de la sphère familiale.\nLes vols violents (+17%) et sans violence (+6%), notamment dans les transports en commun (+8%), y enregistrent également des hausses significatives, tout comme les cambriolages (+6%).\nEn revanche les vols liés aux véhicules (-13%) et les dégradations et destructions volontaires (-5%) poursuivent leur baisse déjà observée depuis mi-juillet.\nAprès deux semaines de forte hausse, les faits d'outrages et violences envers les personnes dépositaires de l'autorité publique, attribués à la forte présence des forces de l'ordre dans les rues, déclinent (-8%).\nDes données à interpréter \"avec prudence\" Enfin, le nombre de mis en cause pour usage de stupéfiants est en hausse de 7% autour des sites olympiques en Île-de-France par rapport à la semaine dernière, tout en restant inférieur à la première semaine de juillet.\nLe SSMSI souligne que le \"suivi hebdomadaire ainsi que la déclinaison des statistiques de la délinquance enregistrée par zone géographique peuvent conduire à observer un faible, voire très faible, nombre de crimes et délits, ce qui peut rendre les évolutions hebdomadaires volatiles\".\n\"De manière générale, toute évolution hebdomadaire inférieure à 10% doit être commentée avec précaution\", explique-t-il. Et d'ajouter qu'il ne \"diffuse pas la totalité des indicateurs\" qu'il suit habituellement, dans la mesure où certains \"présentent des effectifs trop faibles pour une analyse hebdomadaires pertinente (homicides, violences sexuelles, trafic de stupéfiants par exemple)\".\nM.Re avec AFP Top Articles\nJO 2024: déception pour Bennama en argent en boxe, Team USA défiera les Bleus en finale",

    "text": "Prisión para Echedey por el presunto asesinato de su padre en Santa Lucía de Tirajana El supuesto autor de la muerte de su padre con un corte en el cuello, en los calabozos de la Benemérita El caso bajo secreto de sumario Las labores de investigación de la [Guardia Civil](https://www.laprovincia.es/tags/guardia-civil/) continuaron por segundo día ayer para esclarecer el presunto asesinato de un hombre de 55 años a manos de su hijo, Echedey León, de 22 años, de una cuchillada en el cuello. Ocurrió en la jornada del miércoles, horas antes del hallazgo del cuerpo, en el centro canino Besos de Perro en el barrio de Hoya Negra del municipio de [Santa Lucía]({url_geo_14026}). El jueves se vivió en este pago una jornada atípica tras el desenlace fatal y parte del barrio, precintado por segundo día. El juez ha decretado la prisión preventiva para el joven por el presunto asesinato de su padre. El padre, de 55 años, tenía antecedentes administrativos por temas relacionados con el consumo de sustancias estupefacientes y Echedey, su hijo, también supuestamente consumidor de drogas, «era tranquilón, pero tenía brotes violentos cuando dejaba su fuerte medicación, muy a menudo», dicen allegados. Su madre Según vecinos de la zona, fueron agentes de una patrulla de la [Policía Local de Santa Lucía](/fotos/sucesos/2024/02/01/detenido-joven-santa-lucia-matar-97626016.html) los que procedieron a la detención de Echedey, que conducía un vehículo por el camino a medio asfaltar que pasa por delante del centro canino donde su padre atendía a los animales. Los agentes habían sido alertados por la madre del joven y presunto parricida al gritarle él mismo que había matado a su propio padre. «Yo lo conocía desde niño, nos criamos juntos, vecinos de siempre, ahí en [Sardina](/tags/sardina-del-sur), pero la verdad, no sé qué decirte. Ahora ya de mayores no coincidíamos. Solo en las fincas que tenemos aquí en el barrio, pero no manteníamos contacto. La gente va cambiando y perdemos la relación». Así lo relataba ayer en su furgoneta uno de los propietarios de terrenos anexos al centro canino del que se hacía cargo el fallecido. Mientras otro «conocido», esta vez lugareño de Sardina, aseveró que allí «todos conocían» al presunto parricida. Autopsia El cadáver del padre se encuentra en el Instituto de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses de [Las Palmas](/tags/las-palmas) desde que fue trasladado el día del crimen, donde se le iba a practicar la autopsia que determinará la hora exacta del fallecimiento así como las causas de su muerte. Los forenses esclarecerán también si pudo haber una disputa previa entre padre e hijo, antes del desenlace final. La zona quedó acordonada también durante el día de ayer. A mediodía se personaron los agentes de la Guardia Civil para volver a desplegar a sus investigadores por todo el perímetro al igual que en interior del centro de animales Perros de Besos. Desde el cuerpo de la Benemérita solo confirmaron que los efectivos acudieron para analizar a fondo la escena del crimen y recabar los indicios y pruebas necesarios para esclarecer lo sucedido. Entre los objetos recuperados se encontró anteayer el arma blanca con la que presuntamente Echedey le quitó la vida a su padre. Fuentes oficiales del Ayuntamiento de Santa Lucía informaron ayer de que desconocían este centro canino que «debe ser de nueva creación». A priori, es competencia del [Gobierno canario](https://www.laprovincia.es/tags/gobierno-de-canarias/) otorgar las licencias de apertura y de Urbanismo municipal, las de obras.
