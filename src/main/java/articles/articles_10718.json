    "text": "Districts can request reimbursement as they upgrade or replace diesel-powered buses. Roughly $13.5 million is available through the grant program, which is administered by [the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/). The details Everyone benefits when schools transition to cleaner transportation, TCEQ Program Specialist Nate Hickman said. “The new school buses certainly have little to zero exhaust ... so the air in and around the school buses are cleaner,” Hickman said. “That’s great for the children, the bus drivers, teachers at the school and the administration, but also the immediate communities [that] buses drive in and around.” Districts can choose to upgrade existing diesel buses to limit emissions or purchase new diesel, propane and electric-powered vehicles. Buses must have been built before 2007 to be eligible for replacement, according to the TCEQ. “The engines that were in those [older] buses are large, much dirtier diesel engines for the most part, so the exhaust coming out of those is pretty heavy-duty,” Hickman said. “You can even see it with a particulate matter.” About the program Applications for the 19th year of [the Texas Clean School Bus program](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/terp/school-buses.html)opened Feb. 14. Districts have until Oct. 14 to apply, but Hickman said funding is typically exhausted within the first few months. The state covers up to five projects for each district, including full reimbursement for retrofitting projects and up to 80% reimbursement for new school buses. The Texas Legislature launched the program in 2005. Why it matters Compared to their diesel-powered counterparts, electric buses are more fuel-efficient, cheaper to maintain and quieter. One electric bus can eliminate 1,690 tons of carbon dioxide in 12 years, which is equivalent to taking 27 gas or diesel-powered cars off the road, [the U.S. Department of Transportation reported](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/R2ZE-Zero-Small.pdf). Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that can cause reduced lung function, make children more susceptible to pneumonia and even lead to cancer, [according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/policy/hi5/cleandiesel/). Austin ISD recently [received $6.25 million in federal funding](https://communityimpact.com/austin/north-central-austin/education/2024/01/10/austin-isd-receives-625m-in-federal-funding-toward-electric-buses/)for 25 new electric buses. The district plans to convert all of its diesel buses to electric by 2035, [as previously reported](https://communityimpact.com/austin/southwest-austin-dripping-springs/education/2022/10/20/austin-isd-to-become-first-school-district-in-texas-to-convert-all-buses-to-electric/)by Community Impact.

    "text": "Loading... Loading... Natasha Dinnall may not be a household name, but her role is essential to the daily lives of countless New Yorkers.\nAt 51 years old, she serves as a subway conductor, ensuring the smooth operation of one of the world's largest rapid transit systems, according to CNBC.\nWith 493 stations on 25 routes and 24/7 operations, the NYC subway caters to over 3 million passengers daily, surpassing 1 billion riders in 2022.\nDinnall has dedicated over a decade of her life to the Q train line, becoming intimately familiar with every stop along the way.\nHer daily routine involves shuttling passengers through three loops on the Q line, which spans from Coney Island to the Upper East Side, passing through iconic locations like Times Square, the outlet noted.\nAs a conductor, she must maintain discipline and reliability to ensure the trains adhere to their schedules while also addressing passengers' various requests and navigating New York's diverse range of personalities.\nDinnall's journey into the world of subway conductors began in 1992 when she joined the New York City Transit Authority . Her father, already an employee of the city's transit system, handed her an application that ultimately set her on this career path.\nOver the years, she has held multiple roles within the agency, from property protection agent to station agent, conductor, train operator, and back to conductor again, according to CNBC.\nBecoming a conductor involves extensive training, lasting seven to nine weeks, and necessitates periodic refresher courses every three years to keep skills up-to-date.\nAlso Read: The Financial Samurai: Unveiling The Man Behind A $4.4M Portfolio\nDinnall's workday starts early, with her arrival at 4:40 a.m. and the first train departing at 4:55 a.m. Over the course of her shift, she completes three round trips on the Q train, connecting Coney Island to the Upper East Side, the outlet reported.\nHer day typically concludes at 2:15 p.m., and she maintains constant communication with the train operator, ensuring the system remains on schedule.\nDespite occasional challenges like early mornings, weekend shifts and various passenger demands, Dinnall embraces her role with enthusiasm. She told CNBC she values the customer interactions and enjoys helping people reach their destinations.\nLoading... Loading... However, one thing she doesn't tolerate is criticism of the subway, staunchly defending her job as the best, the outlet pointed out.\nRegarding compensation, Dinnall acknowledged to CNBC that while her job provides a substantial income, it's not a fortune. She's worked her way up to earning $86,000 per year, a testament to her dedication.\nStarting pay for conductors is $24.32 per hour, increasing to $34.75 by the sixth year of service. Dinnall currently earns $35 per hour and said she appreciates the financial stability her job offers.\nMoreover, working for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority grants her several perks, including free rides on public transit and the promise of a pension, a rarity in today's workforce. For Dinnall, her career is more than just a job; it's a lifelong commitment to keeping New York City moving efficiently.\nNow Read: Rent The Runway CEO Tells How Early Life Lessons Help Build $95M Company\nThis story is part of a series of features on the subject of success, Benzinga Inspire .\nHow can you invest in early-stage startups if you don’t know the founders?

It frequently alerts users across the country about various vulnerabilities in products from manufacturers such as [Apple](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tags/apple) and [Google](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tags/google). The organisation is now back with warnings regarding new vulnerabilities found in Apple products, including iPhone models not running the latest iOS 18.1.1. Most of these vulnerabilities affect users with older versions of software such as iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. Therefore, the primary line of defence is to update your software. That being said, here are the software versions that are affected.\nAlso Read: [For the first time ever!

If your device has stopped receiving updates, you should consider upgrading to a device that supports the latest software to ensure you are protected.\n[Not sure which](/gadget-recommender/mobile)\nmobile to buy?\nmobile to buy?\nThe organisation notes that these vulnerabilities, which have been reported in Apple products, could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks on affected devices.\nAlso Read: [GTA 6 secures ‘Most Wanted Game' title at Golden Joystick Awards; Rockstar promises exciting updates ahead](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/gta-6-secures-most-wanted-game-title-at-golden-joystick-awards-rockstar-promises-exciting-updates-ahead-71732252815643.html)\nNo Need To Worry Once You Update Your Device's Software\nThere is no cause for concern if you update your software. It is worth noting that Apple typically only publicly notifies users about a potential vulnerability once it has been fixed.
