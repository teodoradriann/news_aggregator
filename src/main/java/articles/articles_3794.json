    "text": "At the end of every year, it’s natural to look back. Here at Azure, the annual tradition entails taking stock of the last 12 months of design, including [public spaces](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-10-of-2023-our-favourite-public-spaces/), [interiors](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-10-of-2023-our-favourite-interiors/), [products](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-10-of-2023-our-favourite-product-designs/), as well as [residential](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-houses-2023-our-favourite-homes/) and [commercial architecture](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-10-of-2023-our-favourite-architecture-projects/). And every January, we turn the page and look forward. In 2024, there’s plenty to look forward to. From landmark cultural buildings to new public spaces and innovations in sustainable design, the year ahead promises a wealth of architectural imagination and problem-solving around the globe. In no particular order below, we round up the most anticipated architecture for 2024.

In 2014, photographer Milos Bicanski [revisited a series of venues constructed for the 2004 edition](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2014/aug/13/abandoned-athens-olympic-2004-venues-10-years-on-in-pictures) of the Olympics in Athens, Greece. While only a decade old, the buildings already resembled ruins: overgrown with plants and utterly devoid of human life. Such was the fate of sports facilities that were too big — or located too far from urban crowds — to ensure their future success. Since then, the Games and their host cities have worked to place a bigger emphasis on developing venues that can be easily adapted to community use. This summer’s upcoming edition in Paris stands as an example of a new chapter of Olympics construction. Planned for the most part around existing facilities (many of which are being temporarily expanded), the 2024 Olympic Games will introduce just one new venue: an aquatic centre designed by Amsterdam-based architecture firm [VenhoevenCS](https://venhoevencs.nl/) and the Parisian architects at [Ateliers 234](https://www.a234.fr/en/). Even this bowl-shaped building reflects a new way of thinking. For one thing, sustainability is at the heart of the project, with mass timber construction used to construct a roofline that dips and rises to the minimum height required in seating and swimming areas — thereby reducing the amount of air that needs to be conditioned inside. Similarly, all furniture is made out of recycled wood or plastic, a solar roof will provide 25 per cent of required electricity, and a water system will see 50 per cent of the facility’s water reused. At the end of the games, the building will become a community sports and event centre for the community of Saint-Denis, Paris. So while it is bound to make a splash as a backdrop to water polo and diving competitions this summer, come back in 2034 and you’ll — hopefully — find a facility that’s still very much at the top of its game. # Part aspen tree, part Rocky Mountain, and part sci-fi spectacle, this [13-storey tower ](https://studiogang.com/project/Populus)designed by [Studio Gang](https://studiogang.com/project/Populus) creates a new Denver landmark that brings together natural and otherworldly influences on a triangular downtown lot. Set to be home to America’s “first carbon-positive hotel” (meaning that more than 5,000 acres of forest will be planted to offset emissions from the project’s concrete construction), Populus is named after populus tremuloides, the scientific term for the quaking aspen (which is a fixture of the Colorado landscape). This same species also serves as the inspiration behind the building’s façade, which uses a series of window modules to recreate the eye-shaped marks left on a tree’s bark when they shed their lower branches. These window modules start as 9-metre-tall, portal-like archways at ground level, then twist and warp into other forms as the building rises. Both inside and out, these distinctive apertures are designed to be as functional as they are visually striking. For one thing, their “brows” act as drainage channels to direct rainwater. Inside, meanwhile, the windows are integrated into interior wall niches that provide window seating for admiring the building’s many notable neighbours — namely, the nearby State Capitol and Civic Center Park. Up top, guests will find another great vantage point in the rooftop restaurant and bar, complete with a terrace sheltered by a pair of stepped walls that recall the craggy mountain range just beyond. Evidently, Populus is set to be a destination that both pays honours and amplifies its setting. Construction [topped out last August](https://www.9news.com/article/money/business/topping-out-populus-hotel/73-ae01e212-9161-4e9d-afce-6bc8939b0b6a), with the 265-room hotel expected to open this summer. # To say we’ve been following the development of Limberlost Place for a while would be an understatement. [Moriyama & Teshima](https://mtarch.com/) and [Acton Ostry Architects](https://www.actonostry.ca/)’ winning scheme for the mass-timber tower (formerly dubbed The Arbour) was announced in April 2018 and took home the [AZ Award for Unbuilt Buildings the next year](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/az-awards-2019-winner-the-arbour/). Since then, we’ve patiently awaited its arrival on the Toronto waterfront. When finally completed this fall, the building will host the Schools of Architectural Studies and Technology at George Brown College, opening just in time for the winter semester, as well as Canada’s first Tall Wood Research Institute. Its striking angular form, clad in warm terracotta, will make for an inviting presence on campus. The expansive wood interior, bathed in natural light, is organized around a triple-height atrium, complete with amphitheatre-style stairs that guide students up to the surrounding lecture halls, computer labs and social spaces. Thanks to its thin yet stable structure, made from CLT and trapezoidal steel plates, the architects have maximized spans, reducing the need for beams. This move not only makes for a light and open interior, which is flexible enough to adapt as programmatic needs change, but also reduces costs (both fiscal and environmental). A beacon of sustainability, Limberlost Place will leverage a thermally efficient prefab building envelope, deep lake water cooling, rooftop PV and two solar chimneys to achieve net zero carbon status. The nearly 21,000-square-metre project tops out at 10 storeys, setting an innovative precedent for mass-timber construction in Toronto and beyond. Though it will be the first building of its kind in Canada, the unparalleled engagement and research it has inspired will ensure it is not the last. # In recent years, [the work of Francis Kéré](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/diebedo-francis-keres-global-localism/) has become [a mainstay on Azure’s “Best of” lists](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/top-10-of-2022-our-favourite-public-spaces/). With the Goethe-Institut Dakar, he has earned his place once again. Located in the Senegalese capital, the building will mark the first purpose-built space in the German cultural institute’s 60-year history. And who better to translate this union of German and West African cultures than the [Burkina Faso-born, Berlin-based architect](https://www.kerearchitecture.com/)? “On numerous levels, the design represents the values that both I and the Goethe-Institut share,” Kéré told World Architecture at the ground-breaking ceremony in 2022. “When it came to issues like sustainability and climate protection, I was not only met with an open and sympathetic response but was even encouraged to take things further.” Conceived with respect for the surrounding residential neighbourhood, the nearby Léopold Sédar Senghor Museum and the natural environment, the compact two-story building occupies the smallest possible footprint, mirroring the tree canopy that has long occupied the site. The double-skinned masonry structure, made from locally sourced BTC bricks, echoes its context. The outermost layer acts as a permeable screen that filters in natural light while buffering street noise and regulating the indoor climate. The L-shaped building frames a courtyard, where visitors can gather under the tree at its centre. This marriage of sustainable, local materials and community-centred design is trademark Kéré. When the 1,800-square-metre building opens its doors, it will host everything from exhibitions and language courses to concerts and informal gatherings. Administrative offices and classrooms fill the first floor, while public programs bookend the building: The auditorium, cafeteria and library are easily accessible on the ground level, while the rooftop serves as a social space with tree-shaped pillars that recall the garden below. The building’s architectural language reflects the “layered and storied cultural tapestry” of Dakar, yet feels remarkably universal, and welcoming to all. # Mumbai architect [Sameep Padora](https://sp-arc.net/) has been [creating sublime architecture attuned to its context](https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/i-want-to-create-values-that-are-perceptible-a-conversation-with-sameep-padora/) – like the wonderful Maya Somaya Library at Kopargaon – since setting up practice in 2006. Due to be completed imminently, the Hampi Art Labs is his most recent masterstroke. An initiative of the JSW Foundation, the sinuous, terracotta-hued centre provides facilities for both exhibiting and making art, including printmaking labs, stone and metal sculpture facilities, ceramics studios and a focus on new media. Its first exhibition, Right Foot First, will present pieces from the collection of Sangita Jindal, the JSW chairperson who founded HAL with her daughter, Tarini; dating from 1998 to 2023, it includes works by Andy Warhol, Ai Weiwei, B.V. Doshi, Dayanita Singh, Reena Saini Kallat, Rohini Devasher and Zarina Hashmi. The centre is situated in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hampi near the river Tungabhadra, whose craggy hills and prominent boulders can be viewed as natural analogues to Padora’s organic architecture. Comprised of several buildings – a major pavilion that wraps around one end of the seven-hectare site and five smaller structures clustered opposite – the complex is a composition of interconnected undulating forms. Made of soil, stone and steel, they speak to the past: Padora drew inspiration from the Vijayanagar Kingdom that once stood here, and its era between the 14th and 16th centuries, when “art, architecture, and literature flourished,” plus HAL’s program immerses artists in the region’s “richly replete craft culture and distinctive traditions and techniques.” In their advancement of the vernacular, however, Hampi Art Labs also boldly represents the moment, as age-old techniques and locally derived materials have reconquered the architectural imagination. # Netherlands-based architecture firm [MVRDV](https://www.mvrdv.com/) is working with the Taiwanese government to upgrade an existing storage and maintenance building, housing renewable energy equipment, into a super solar power station. When Sun Rock, the government-funded power station in Changhua County is completed, in addition to being completely self-sufficient, it will generate 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy per year for Taiwanese communities. A giant rounded dome covered in pleated photovoltaic panels; this remarkable structure is as imposing as it is impactful. Dark and dramatic, the building’s facade was designed to capture as much sunlight as possible, angling solar panels to maximize production. The facility will feature workshops, offices, and storage as well as multiple public viewing galleries, including the Data Room – complete with live updates on the building’s energy production — in an effort to foster environmental visibility. Described as a “manifesto in a building,” MVRDV’s Sun Rock will be a tangible example of Taiwan’s commitment to a greener future. # [Henning Larsen](https://henninglarsen.com/en)’s Sundby School in Nykøbing Falster, Denmark, carefully intertwines learning and landscape. The project by the international architecture, landscape and urbanism studio embodies the idea that learning takes place within a community and a landscape, not a solitary building. The school itself acts as a tool for learning, with an impressive, sloped roof that forms a hill which students can climb to watch the sunset or slide down in winter. On the school grounds, there will be no fences or barriers; the circular design of the environs will protect its students while still allowing freedom to explore the surrounding countryside — providing students with unique learning opportunities that are not typical of a primary school curriculum. With a renewable and biodegradable thatched facade, the project is designed to meet UN Sustainable Development goals for both design and curriculum and will be the first Danish school to receive the Nordic Ecolabel. Serving 580 students, the school features a library, cafes, music halls and sports facilities that face the town and are accessible to the entire community. # In 2022, 3XN re-shaped the Sydney skyline in thoughtful and eye-catching fashion with the ingeniously “up-cycled” [Quay Quarter Tower](https://awards.azuremagazine.com/article/quay-quarter-tower/). Two years later, the acclaimed Danish designers are set to bring an equally well-considered addition to the city’s public realm with the relocated and re-imagined Sydney Fish Market. Situated on a wharf in the heart of the city, the 80,000-square-metre project is envisioned as a foodie mecca and an inviting extension of the public realm. Organized around a modular internal grid of vendors, the design integrates the eclectic ambiance of an urban market into an elegant new destination. Framed by public space and filled with ample seating and natural light, the complex blurs the boundaries between civic and commercial space to create a distinctly sociable milieu. “3XN’s response places people at the centre, with an emphasis on place-making to foster a strong sense of community,” says firm founder and creative director Kim Herforth Nielsen. “The design excels in its ability to create value for all stakeholders; the fisherman, and restaurateurs as well as neighbours and tourists.” # Since the turn of the millennium, prominent western firms have mined the Chinese market. From OMA’s CCTV Headquarters to Herzog & De Meuron’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium and MVRDV’s Tianjin Binhai Library, leading European designers have leveraged their cultural cachet to help shape emerging global cities with iconic architecture. At Rotterdam’s Fenix Museum of Migration, however, MAD Architects is reversing the equation. In one of the world’s hotbeds of contemporary architecture, the Beijing-based international designers are transforming a historic 16,000-square-metre warehouse — once a key part of the largest warehouse complex in the world — into a waterfront museum dedicated to the history of global migration. Although the landmark project won’t open to the public until 2025, this year will see the structure of the adaptive reuse showpiece take shape, capped by a sinuous staircase, dubbed the Tornado, that rises from the old building. A symbol of winding migrant journeys, the sculptural form culminates in panoramic views of the landscape. “The Tornado is all about the future, but it’s rooted in the past,” says MAD Architects founder Ma Yansong. “For me, it’s a metaphor for the journeys of migrants who passed through this building.” # Simplicity is the key ingredient in OMA’s design for the Simone-Weil Bridge in Bordeaux. One of six bridges that span the Garonne river – and the first ever such infrastructural project by OMA – the soon-to-be completed project wears its stripped-down aesthetic as a badge of honour. “The design is kept to the simplest expression – the least technical, least lyrical, an almost primitive structural solution,” say the architects. The raison d’être for both the bridge and its plain-ness, in fact, is its ability to be transformed for any purpose. This is primarily a place for pedestrians. And place is the key word. More boulevard than bridge, the continuous surface slopes ever so gently, to provide clearance for boats, while seamlessly connecting to landscaped public places on either side. (These spill onto neighbourhoods, St. Jean Belcier and Floirac, on the left and right banks, respectively.) While the 549-metre-long span dedicates lanes to cars, trams/buses and bikes, it’s people on foot who enjoy the lion’s share of the real estate across the bridge’s 44-metre width. And when festivals and markets are scheduled, sections can be closed off completely to vehicular traffic. One of the most evocative images released by the firm is a rendering depicting how the Simon-Weil Bridge might regularly be animated – big white tents, open-air stages featuring stadium-style seating and major art installations entice crowds of people onto this generous platform for public programs that connects the city literally and figuratively. From Dakar to Denver, our most anticipated architecture projects of the year reflect the evolving potential of design.",

    "text": "Winter Weather: Cold & Gusty\nChilly weekend ahead\n- Below-freezing temperatures through next week\n- Dangerous travel if your heading south\n- No snow on the horizon\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Flurries and light snow showers will persist through mid-morning across southern Wisconsin, tapering off by late morning. Accumulation is minimal, with a dusting at most expected, and gusty northwest winds, reaching up to 25 mph, will likely blow away any light snow. Temperatures will hover in the upper teens to low 20s, but brisk winds will make it feel much colder, with wind chills remaining in the single digits. Skies will stay mostly cloudy through the afternoon, with gradual clearing expected later in the day and into the evening.\nDespite the light snow, roads across the region should remain in good condition, with little to no significant accumulation expected. However, high winds could create brief visibility issues, especially in open areas. For those driving or spending time outdoors, the biting wind will make it feel considerably colder, so warm layers and proper winter gear are essential.\nWhat comes next...\nSaturday brings a mix of sunshine and clouds as Arctic high pressure moves into the area. While the day will feel brighter, temperatures will struggle to climb above the upper teens, and northwest winds will keep the wind chill in the single digits. Outdoor enthusiasts should prepare for frigid conditions, especially during early morning hours when lows could dip into the single digits or even below zero in some spots. Sunday starts off dry but cloudier as a storm system passes south of the region. Although Wisconsin is unlikely to see snow from this system, the increase in cloud cover will make it feel gloomier. Temperatures will remain cold, with highs in the upper teens to low 20s.\nLooking ahead...\nEarly Monday morning, southeastern Wisconsin may see a quick burst of lake-effect snow as northeasterly winds develop on the backside of the departing storm system. Any snow will likely be localized and light but could create slippery conditions for the morning commute. The rest of the week looks dry but bitterly cold, with highs struggling to rise above the teens and lows frequently dipping into the single digits or lower. Brisk northwest winds will persist, keeping wind chills near or below zero, and occasional flurries may drift through the area under cloudy skies.\n[Click here](https://www.nbc15.com/page/find-nbc15-news-wherever-you-are/) to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2022 WMTV.

    "text": "El secretario general de la ONU, António Guterres, ha celebrado el anuncio de la entrada de medicinas y ayuda humanitaria a la Franja de Gaza gracias a un acuerdo alcanzado en los últimos días entre Israel y el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás), según confirmaron las autoridades de Qatar, que actúan como mediadoras entre las partes. \"(Guterres) acoge con agrado el anuncio de una operación para entregar medicamentos y suministros médicos adicionales y muy necesarios a la población civil de la Franja de Gaza y para los rehenes actualmente retenidos\", ha indicado el portavoz del secretario general, Stéphane Dujarric, durante una rueda de prensa, en la que ha agradecido el papel de Qatar y Francia \"por sus esfuerzos\". En este sentido, ha manifestado que \"la entrada de estos suministros y ayuda humanitaria es alentadora, aunque es necesario que llegue mucha más ayuda\" al enclave, mientras que ha instado a \"todos los actores relevantes\" a garantizar que llegue \"suficiente ayuda\" allá \"donde sea necesaria\" y ha pedido la \"reactivación del sector privado para llevar productos básicos a la Franja\". Al mismo tiempo, Guterres ha reiterado su llamamiento a un \"alto el fuego humanitario inmediato\" y una \"liberación inmediata e incondicional de los rehenes\", y por otro lado ha expresado su \"continúa preocupación por el aumento de la escalada en la región\", pidiendo una reducción urgente de las tensiones. \"Necesitamos ver el fin de la violencia. Existen diferentes marcos y creo que quizás, especialmente, necesitamos obtener compromisos de las partes más interesadas para avanzar hacia ese objetivo, y luego podremos ver cuál es el mejor marco para llegar allí\", ha declarado su portavoz al ser preguntado sobre el papel del secretario de cara a las negociaciones de la comunidad internacional. El Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) lanzó a comienzos de octubre una serie de ataques que dejaron unos 1.200 muertos y cerca de 240 secuestrados. El Ejército de Israel respondió con una cruenta contraofensiva contra la Franja de Gaza que se cobra ya más de 24.600 vidas palestinas. A eso se suman más de 360 muertos en operaciones de las fuerzas de seguridad y ataques por parte de colonos en Cisjordania y Jerusalén Este.\nGuterres celebra el anuncio de entregar medicamentos \"muy necesarios\" a la población de Gaza y los rehenes\nDEPORTES\nEl argentino Tomás Etcheverry buscará la hazaña para cortar el histórico invicto de Novak Djokovic en el Australian Open: hora y TV\nCon el reestreno de la dupla Messi-Suárez, Inter Miami disputará su primer amistoso de pretemporada ante El Salvador: hora y TV\nLionel Messi arranca su travesía con Inter Miami: la guía de los 38 mil kilómetros que recorrerá en un mes\nLa tajante respuesta del Cholo Simeone sobre su pelea con Vinicius en la goleada del Atlético al Real Madrid\nENTRETENIMIENTO\nEmily Ratajkowski reveló por qué cambió de opinión sobre el feminismo: “Ahora no estoy de acuerdo”\nLas inéditas confesiones de Penélope Cruz sobre su vida familiar con Javier Bardem y sus dos hijos\nJodie Foster reveló por qué rechazó el papel de Princesa Leia en ‘Star Wars’: “No sé qué tan buena habría sido”\nLos 10 K-dramas más populares para ver este fin de semana\nTENDENCIAS\nEstrés en la infancia: por qué puede aumentar el riesgo de hipertensión, obesidad y diabetes en la adultez\nBlancos y rosados: tres vinos refrescantes para disfrutar los maridajes del verano\nSin edad: 11 estrategias creativas para disfrutar de las vacaciones en familia",

    "title": "Otro “radical con peluca”: un intendente de Río Negro se sumó a La Libertad Avanza y buscan expulsarlo de la UCR - Infobae",
    "text": "Marcelo Román, intendente radical de la ciudad rionegrina de Allen, junto la diputada de La Libertad Avanza Lorena Villaverde y Sebastián Parejas Los cinco diputados radicales que fueron incluidos en la lista de los “87 héroes” que apoyaron a Javier Milei con los vetos presidenciales no son los únicos que se “pusieron la peluca” , como los definieron sus adversarios en la UCR. Ahora se sumó un intendente de la provincia de Río Negro que, en su caso, fue un paso más adelante: asumió como vicepresidente de La Libertad Avanza local , acompañando a la legisladora Lorena Villaverde , quien lleva adelante la construcción nacional que encabeza Karina Milei . Como consecuencia, el partido centenario ya inició el pedido de expulsión del jefe comunal.\nSe trata de Marcelo Román , intendente de la ciudad de Allen, un territorio que cobró importancia a raíz de la construcción del oleoducto. La obra se iniciará en esa zona y terminará en Punta Colorada. Según pudo reconstruir Infobae , su acercamiento a La Libertad Avanza se inició a mediados del mes de marzo y posteriormente fue elegido como vicepresidente del partido que, hasta el momento, cuenta con una personería jurídica provisoria.\nMarcelo Román llegó a la intendencia de Allen con la lista de la UCR Un dato no menor, y que enoja a los referentes boinas blancas, es que Román llegó a la intendencia de Allen en abril de 2023 con el 35% de los votos con la lista de la UCR. “Es el primer intendente que se suma a La Libertad Avanza” , destacó en diálogo con este medio Julián Goinhex , un hombre de extrema confianza de Villaverde, la diputada nacional que ocupa el cargo de titular del partido. Según aclaró, no se trata de una alianza sino de una incorporación a “las fuerzas del cielo”.\nAl conocerse el caso, la mesa directiva de la Unión Cívica Radical de Río Negro comenzó el proceso de desafiliación del intendente de Allen. Al igual que ocurre a nivel nacional con los cinco “diputados con peluca”, elevaron el pedido al Tribunal de Disciplina para que defina la expulsión definitiva.\nAgustina Madariaga , integrante de esa mesa directiva, cuestionó en diálogo con Infobae : “No tenemos mucho que ver con el lineamiento de la LLA. Es hasta incoherente , somos un partido centenario siempre abogando por los derechos, de los obreros, de los estudiantes, de los jubilados. Estar afiliado a la UCR y firmar adhesión a LLA es incompatible. Creo que tenemos más similitudes con el peronismo que con el PRO o La Libertad Avanza”.\n“Me tiene sin cuidado lo que piense un puñado de personas que se arrogan el derecho de ser los radicales de cepa”, respondió tajante el intendente durante una entrevista con el medio rionegrino Show CdC . En ese sentido, reconoció que fue elegido en las últimas elecciones por la lista de la UCR pero envió reproches por “falta de apoyo” de los correligionarios en la gestión. “Lamentablemente duele más el dardo del enemigo de adentro y no el de afuera”, reflexionó.\nMarcelo Román junto a Lorena Villaverde y Patricia Bullrich Tan aceitado está el vínculo entre el intendente Román con La Libertad Avanza, que hace unos días la ministra de Seguridad, Patricia Bullrich , viajó al sur argentino para anunciar la instalación un “espacio” de Gendarmería Nacional entre Allen y Fernández Oro, en el Alto Valle de Río Negro, para tener movilidad y trabajo cercano en toda la región, incluyendo Neuquén y la zona de Vaca Muerta.\n“Ahora vamos a estar más cerca porque vamos a abrir un espacio de la Gendarmería entre Fernández Oro y Allen, vamos a abrir una Gendarmería que va a estar entre Neuquén y Río Negro. Vamos a trabajar fuerte acompañando a ambas provincias en la lucha contra el narcotráfico”, justificó la funcionaria nacional.\nEl pase del intendente responde, según pudo reconstruir este medio, a la interna radical local, que se diferencia poco de la nacional. La UCR conquistó un total de ocho municipios de Río Negro, quienes también estarían en conversaciones con los libertarios, mientras los radicales encolumnados con las autoridades partidarias mantienen la alianza electoral que gestaron con Alberto Weretilneck .",

    "text": "During the Christmas period, parts of South America experienced intense showers and thunderstorms, resulting in substantial rainfall in various regions. On Monday, more than 100mm of rain fell in the Catamarca province in Argentina , which led to flash floods. A sudden surge in river water levels then caused the collapse of a pedestrian bridge, which was the only link between the towns of Rincón and Pomán. While many other roads in the region were damaged and houses were flooded, no casualties were reported.\nThe unique topography of Catamarca aided the formation of a near-stationary convective shower over Pomán, unleashing several hours of torrential rain and causing catastrophic flooding.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has also been affected by severe rainfall over the past week. On Tuesday night, heavy rains hit the eastern region, resulting in flooding, mudslides and landslides. So far, 40 bodies have been recovered in Bukavu and the surrounding areas. This comes less than a week after 20 people were killed in similar conditions in the Mwenga territory of South Kivu.\nNorth-west India has been experiencing poor visibility over the past few days. Delhi has been particularly badly affected, with visibility plummeting to close to zero metres between 8am and 10am on Wednesday. Parts of Pakistan were also badly affected by the dense fog on Wednesday.\nWidespread disruption to road, rail and air networks was reported by both countries, alongside several severe road incidents. Fog forms when air is cooled to the dew point – the temperature at which water vapour condenses – essentially forming a cloud at surface level.\nTemperatures across Pakistan and north-west India have been lower than usual, helping fog to develop. When fog is combined with pollutants, smog develops. This has widely been seen across north-west India, with air quality being classified as very poor by the India Meteorological Department, which could pose serious health risks.\nNorthern Turkey also experienced dense fog on Thursday. This led to a serious road crash involving seven vehicles, including three buses, killing 10 people and injuring 57 others.\nExplore more on these topics Extreme weather Weather tracker Democratic Republic of the Congo Africa Argentina India Pakistan Turkey analysis\nReuse this content",

    "title": "Textbook Shortage Hits Goa Schools Amid Rising Demand for SCERT Books",
    "text": "A sudden shortage of textbooks prescribed by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has been reported in several parts of Goa, following an unexpected rise in demand from private schools.\nThe shortage primarily affects textbooks for Classes I to IV, which have traditionally been supplied only to government and aided schools. Last week, shops reported a shortage of higher secondary text books for Classes IX to XII.\nIn recent times, several private schools across Goa have begun adopting the SCERT textbooks, leading to increased pressure on the existing supply system. While SCERT has ensured the distribution of textbooks to government and aided institutions as per the usual procedure, the body does not directly supply books to private schools. Instead, these institutions are expected to source them from the open market through local book sellers.\nA book seller from Margao, who requested anonymity, said, “The demand from private schools has gone up significantly this academic year, but there’s not enough stock available to meet the requirement.” According to him, many stores are currently out of stock, leaving parents and schools scrambling to find the necessary textbooks.\nReacting to the issue, SCERT Chairperson Meghana Shetgaonkar confirmed that the council has been receiving increasing requests from book sellers regarding the shortage.\n“We have completed the distribution to government and aided schools as per the schedule. However, we are now seeing demand from private schools. Since SCERT does not supply directly to them, the books must be purchased from the market,” Shetgaonkar said.\nShe also clarified that SCERT is prepared to address the shortfall. “We have asked sellers and private schools to communicate their requirements. Once we receive those, we are ready to print additional copies to fulfill the demand,” she added.\nThe shift by private schools towards using SCERT textbooks is seen by some educators as a move to align with state-approved curriculum and to reduce the cost burden on parents, as SCERT books are more affordable than those from private publishers.",
