    "text": "Panaji: Four houses located along the canal coming from the Tillari reservoir in Sodiem-Siolim saw water entering their houses on Thursday morning, after the canal overflowed. Locals said that one resident’s compound wall collapsed due to the force of the water flow, while another local suffered damages to his car repair workshop.Locals said that drains had also not been cleared in Sodiem-Siolim, which caused the water to enter the homes.Water supply from the Tillari reservoir to Goa was shut for canal repair works and maintenance for almost 45 days and was restored on Thursday.“The water resources department personnel had not cleared the channels of the canals, which caused the water to overflow. The panchayat usually clears the drain before or during the monsoon months. As no rainfall was expected, the drains had naturally not been cleared. Who has foreseen such an incident?” said the local sarpanch Deepa Pednekar.She said that the water resources department has been constantly requested by the Siolim panchayat to keep the channels of the canal clear of debris.“For last many years, we have been struggling to get the WRD to fix the water flowing from the canal into the fields in Siolim. The fields are lying uncultivated because of the unexpected overflow from the canal. During March-April, just as the harvest is about to dry, the water from the canal gushes into the fields, causing the harvest to be ruined,” said Pednekar.On Thursday, the water flow into the houses began at around 9.30am. The panchayat was informed around 10am, after which the efforts began to clear the drains. The situation was under control by Thursday evening.“The flow of the water from the canal was so high that it was difficult to stand outside these four houses that were affected. This has caused major inconvenience to the residents,” the sarpanch said.",

    "text": "Parigi, 6 mag. (askanews) - Il presidente francese Emmanuel Macron ha accolto con favore gli \"impegni\" della Cina di \"astenersi dal vendere armi\" e da \"qualsiasi aiuto a Mosca\". Lo ha confermato in una dichiarazione alla stampa a Parigi dopo l'incontro all'Eliseo con il presidente cinese Xi Jinping. \"Rispettiamo i legami di lunga data tra Cina e Russia e gli sforzi compiuti nel corso dei decenni per stabilizzare queste relazioni - ha detto Macron - data questa complessa storia, accogliamo con favore gli impegni assunti dalle autorità cinesi di astenersi dal vendere armi o aiuti a Mosca e di controllare rigorosamente l'esportazione di beni a duplice uso. Questo è quanto lei mi ha detto molto chiaramente, signor presidente, poco più di un anno fa, e quanto lei ha ribadito. E penso che la lunghezza e la qualità dei nostri scambi su questo argomento sono una fonte di conforto\". Macron ha accolto inoltre con favore la \"volontà\" del suo omologo cinese di \"chiedere a tutte le parti coinvolte\" nei vari conflitti di \"dichiarare una tregua olimpica\" durante i Giochi di Parigi di quest'estate. \"Sulla base di questa convergenza di vedute - ha detto - crediamo insieme che una tregua olimpica per tutti i teatri di guerra possa essere un'opportunità per lavorare a una soluzione duratura nel pieno rispetto del diritto internazionale, e la ringrazio, signor Presidente, per aver giustamente dimostrato durante il nostro incontro la vostra volontà di impegnarsi nella stessa direzione, che consisterà nel chiedere a tutte le parti coinvolte una tregua olimpica durante i nostri prossimi Giochi\".

    "title": "Teen Mom Stars Maci Bookout and Ryan Edwards Worry About Son Bentley Repeating Their Mistakes: 'He Could Get Somebody Pregnant'",
    "text": "Maci Bookout and Ryan Edwards are no strangers to being teen parents. However, with their son, Bentley, recently turning 16, the co-parents seem to be worried that history will repeat itself. The Teen Mom stars have opened up about their fears regarding their son Bentley possibly following in their footsteps. In a teaser for Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Ryan and his then-girlfriend can be seen visiting Maci and her husband, Taylor McKinney. It was then that the concerns began to rise.\nReports from In Touch Weekly state that once Ryan Edwards got to the home, he and Maci Bookout then discussed their son’s upcoming 16th birthday. According to Maci, Bentley wants all of his “parental figures” to attend his birthday celebration. The young man allegedly wants to have his get-together at a golf course. However, once the co-parents hatched the idea of getting Bentley a car for his birthday, something seemed to click in Maci’s head. It then dawned on her that ground rules would have to be set regarding this new car. That being said, Ryan did not seem too worried about what Bentley would be doing with this newfound freedom. However, Maci was quick to blurt out that, “He could get somebody pregnant.”\nRyan Edwards Makes Jokes as Maci Bookout Worries for Her Son\nAlthough that would be a serious situation. Ryan still found time to slip in a joke as he said, “That don’t have anything to do with a vehicle.” However, Maci continues on by stating that she and Taylor have been talking about whether Bentley is “sexually active.” In a quick fashion, Ryan would then counter by telling Maci that by telling Bentley not to do something over and over again, she would push him to do that exact thing. Maci then ends the topic by hoping Bentley is at least using protection.\nMaci Bookout and Ryan Edwards have had plenty of ups and downs throughout their parenting journey. However, Maci recently opened up about how the two were able to create a healthier co-parenting relationship. Bookout also stated that they have a long way to go before things are ideal. However, this seems like a very good start for the former couple.\nBeing able to remain on good terms for the sake of your children most likely takes a lot of energy and effort. However, the hard work seems to have paid off, as Bentley now gets his family together for his 16th birthday. Fans of the family seemingly can’t wait to see how everything plays out, as for now, they will have to wait.",
