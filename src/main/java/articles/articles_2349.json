Instead if I ask to listen to music on Deezer instead everything works.\nHow can i fix it?\n03-29-2025 10:34 AM\nHello! did you fix it? I have same problem with mine..\n03-29-2025 10:49 AM\nNot yet\n03-29-2025 11:17 AM\nI spent the whole afternoon and still i don't get it! It used to work when I bought it a year ago and now it's been a week since I have the same problem. I tried to reinitialize it, I tried to disconnect my deezer account too and still it doesn't work\n03-29-2025 12:17 PM\nSame here. I'm also trying to find an answer from #Deezer support. No good news right now\n03-29-2025 11:23 AM\nAnd when I put youtube music instead of deezer, I ask Marvin gaye, I have no error message but I get Al green!!\n03-29-2025 12:17 PM\nI just checked on Deezer community and it seems that a lot of people have the same trouble. The answer from Deezer is to be patient, they try to solve it... Anyway, it comes from Deezer and I don't know if they gonna fix it..\n4 weeks ago - last edited 4 weeks ago\nThat's what the Dezeer customer care agent replies yesterday: \"[...] We're currently working with Google and Deezer to resolve the issue, and we expect it to be all sorted out by next week. We kindly ask for your patience during this time. [...] \"\n10m ago\nHi there,\nThanks for reaching out here in the community! I'm sorry to hear you're getting a server error when you ask your Google Home speaker to play a specific album and artist from Deezer. However, when you ask to listen to music on Deezer generally, it works. Help's here!\nIn the meantime, I deeply appreciate you sharing your feedback. We're always looking for ways to improve our products and services to bring the best experience for our users.\nKeep me posted.\nBest regards,\nJenniffer",
