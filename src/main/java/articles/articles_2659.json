    "text": "The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on four Israeli men it accused of being involved in settler violence in the West Bank, signalling growing US displeasure with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on Thursday that aims to punish ill-behaved Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state.\nThe order establishes a system for imposing financial sanctions and visa restrictions against individuals who attack or intimidate Palestinians or seize their property, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.\n\"Today's actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\" he said.\nThe State Department sanctions, freezing the US assets of the four men - David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil, Shalom Zicherman and Shalom Zicherman - and generally barring Americans from dealing with them, are the latest since Palestinian Hamas militants on October 7 carried out an attack on Israel and Israel responded with an assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.\nIn December, the United States began imposing visa bans on people involved in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\"Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement.\n\"The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security, and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.\"\nBiden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.\nBiden has raised the issue directly with Netanyahu, said one senior official, as Biden seeks a path to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians once the Gaza conflict ends.\nNetanyahu, who heads a religious-rightist coalition, has resisted US entreaties to develop a plan for post-conflict Gaza and to embrace a peace deal that envisages Israeli and Palestinian states side by side.\nHis office on Thursday responded to the US measures by saying they were unnecessary.\n\"Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,\" it said in a statement.\n ",

The #1 Nutrient Best Types of Fiber How to Add Fiber Other Tips Close Photo: Recipe: Ali Redmond. EatingWell design. There are plenty of pills, products and programs touted to help improve blood sugar control, from continuous glucose monitors for athletes to the latest trending insulin-supporting supplement. A lot of these methods can get expensive—but do they really work? While the best way to get individualized advice is to talk to your healthcare team, we want to encourage you to think about the lifestyle habits that affect your blood sugar levels. And one of the biggest ways to lower your risk of insulin resistance doesn’t require a prescription: it’s food! Yes, there are things you can do right from the comfort of your own kitchen to support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce your risk of insulin resistance. In this piece, we’re diving into the science around insulin resistance and sharing what registered dietitians agree is the number one nutrient to add to your diet to help reduce it. The Best Time to Eat Dinner for Insulin Resistance, According to Experts What Is Insulin Resistance? Before we jump into insulin resistance, let’s revisit what insulin is. Insulin is a hormone that regulates your blood sugar levels (aka the amount of glucose circulating in your bloodstream). In healthy individuals, after eating, the body begins breaking down that food into glucose to use for energy. Insulin is then released from the pancreas to help collect glucose from the blood and transport it into cells so they can use it for fuel. Unfortunately, sometimes this finely-tuned system can malfunction as a result of specific conditions, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, and other lifestyle factors, such as an unbalanced diet and lack of physical activity. This can leave you with high levels of glucose circulating in the blood coupled with high levels of insulin. Why insulin? Because the pancreas is still pumping out insulin, but the insulin receptors on cells have become resistant to accepting it. This means your body can’t effectively get the glucose in the blood into the cell for use. Over time, this can lead to serious complications and conditions like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thankfully, though, the foods you eat can help your body’s blood glucose remain in a better balance. The #1 Nutrient to Reduce Insulin Resistance The number one nutrient to reduce insulin resistance is dietary fiber, primarily because of the way it helps slow digestion of carbohydrates. A recent 2021 study published in the Journal of Functional Foods found that patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who consumed more dietary fiber, both through whole foods and soluble fiber supplementats, experienced improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. When your body is more sensitive to insulin, this helps reduce insulin resistance and improve your blood sugar control. While the scientists found that supplementating with soluble fiber provided the greatest impact, whole food sources of fiber also played a positive role. New-Jersey based dietitian and certified diabetes expert, Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES, is also a big fiber fan with her patients. She shares, “Dietary fiber can help improve insulin resistance by helping the body to regulate blood sugar levels through slowing the digestion of carbohydrates. Plus, fiber can also help to support a healthy gut microbiome, which has been linked with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation, as well as a reduction in risk of developing type 2 diabetes.” Fiber’s gut-health benefits and their positive impacts on blood sugar control are also supported by a recent 2023 article published in the journal of Foods. The 5 Best Soups to Eat for Better Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians The Best Types of Fiber for Insulin Resistance Eating a fiber-rich diet is one of the best things you can do to help improve insulin resistance. Remember, fiber comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. Many foods contain both types, which reinforces the importance of a variety-filled diet to reap the benefits they provide. While both soluble and insoluble fiber supplements have shown promise when it comes to lowering insulin resistance, some research has found specific foods to help even more. Palinski-Wade points to a recent 2022 study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food that found adding beans to a calorie-restricted diet not only helped reduce insulin resistance, but also promoted weight loss. Beans contain both insoluble and soluble fiber, alongside protein and several vitamins and nutrients, making them a great food to add to your regular routine. Other foods that contain both soluble and insoluble fiber include oats, apples, lentils and vegetables. Florida-based performance dietitian nutritionist Jenna Braddock, M.H.S., RDN, agrees, sharing fiber is one nutrient she encourages clients to eat more of. She writes, “Eating a well-balanced, fiber-rich diet can help to improve blood sugar regulation while also improving overall metabolic health which may go a long way in improving overall insulin sensitivity. Since both types of fiber can benefit glucose and insulin management, getting fiber from a diversity of foods is key.” How to Add More Fiber To Your Diet Most Americans don't eat enough fiber in their typical patterns, so adding different sources throughout the day can add up to help you meet your needs. The recommended daily intake is 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men. Rather than trying to overhaul your eating pattern overnight, think of the small, simple things you add to your day. Keep these tips in mind to increase your intake slowly and steadily. Pair fruit with your morning meal. Berries, bananas and apples are simple and delicious fiber-filled fruits to stock up on. Power up with plant-based protein. Plant-based protein sources like tofu, tempeh, legumes and seeds aren’t just good for the environment, they’re also good for your fiber intake. Consider popping open a can of beans or slicing up a block of tofu to add to soups, salads, stir fries and more. Braddocks shares, “I encourage my clients to use beans not just as a side but also as a garnish for any meal they can to help boost their fiber intake.” Add volume with fruits and veggies. Making soup or sauce? Then add a cup of riced cauliflower to add 2 more grams of fiber and more vitamin C, too. Or, swap in applesauce or mashed bananas when making your baked goods, like muffins, to boost their fiber content while lowering the added sugar. The 5 Best High-Fiber Foods for Diabetes, According to a Dietitian Other Tips for Insulin Resistance While focusing on dietary interventions, like adding more fiber, is important to reduce insulin resistance, that’s not the only thing to consider. Keep these other tips in mind to help improve your insulin sensitivity and support better blood sugar balance. Focus on a balanced diet. Reducing your sodium and saturated fat intake and being mindful of the distribution of carbohydrates and calories throughout your day can help. Stay active. Incorporate daily physical activity in your routine, whether it’s a walk around the block, yoga video or dance class. Prioritize sleep. Logging those zzz’s may impact your blood sugar levels more than you think. Focus on committing to a bedtime routine and sticking with it to see the greatest benefit. Manage stress. Meditation, socialization and seeking professional guidance are all impactful ways to help manage stress. Seek professional support. This can include education, support and personalized advice from a registered dietitian to help meet you where you are when it comes to diet and lifestyle changes. The Bottom Line Nutrition experts unanimously agree that dietary fiber plays a crucial role in reducing insulin resistance. Finding ways to add more of this nutrient to your routine will help benefit your long term blood sugar management. Consider the small things you can change in your daily routine—like swapping white bread for whole-grain bread, adding a side of fruit to your meals, or simply stirring veggies into your soups—to gradually increase your dietary fiber intake. 7-Day High-Protein, High-Fiber Meal Plan for Better Blood Sugar, Created by a Dietitian Was this page helpful?
