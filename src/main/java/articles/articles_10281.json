    "text": "Background: Neuroinflammation has been linked to some central alterations such as cognitive and memory impairment which are prominent features of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease etc. This study explored the cognitive-enhancing properties of a flavonoid, diosmin, on lipopolysaccharide-induced cognitive impairment in mice.\nMethodology: Twenty-eight mice were divided into four groups. These groups were scheduled to receive either vehicle or any of the two doses of diosmin. Groups 2-4 were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 250 µg/kg, i.p.) daily for seven days. Afterwards, all mice were subjected to the Y-maze test and the novel object recognition test (NORT) to assess their spatial and non-spatial working memory, respectively. Subsequently, the mice were sacrificed and brain samples were harvested for biochemical analysis. The data was analysed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc test. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.\nResults: Our data shows that diosmin significantly reversed the LPS-induced neuroinflammation by reducing proinflammatory mediators in the brain and subsequently improving mice memory.\nConclusion: Diosmin possesses properties that could be beneficial in symptom management in such inflammation-related disorders.",

    "title": "Turk-Is President Atalay's statement on minimum wage: It is not possible to accept the figures circulating.",
    "text": "29.11.2024 12:02 The work to determine the new minimum wage figure, which directly concerns 7 million employees and indirectly concerns the entire society, will begin in December. The Minimum Wage Determination Commission, consisting of 15 members with five representatives from workers, employers, and the government, will have TÜRK-İŞ representing the workers and the Turkish Confederation of Employer Associations (TİSK) representing the employers. The 5-member TÜRK-İŞ delegation representing the workers will be led by Deputy General President Ramazan Ağar. As in the previous year, there will be 4 workers in the TÜRK-İŞ delegation this year. Chef Selma Sayın, hairdresser Nihan Koçak, subcontractor worker Durmuş Öztürk from the highways, and press member Sezer Özseven will express the problems and demands of minimum wage earners in the Commission this year. TÜRK-İŞ General President Ergün Atalay stated that the new minimum wage figure will come into effect on January 1, 2025, and emphasized that minimum wage earners will receive their first increased salaries in February. Noting that various sectors, from IMF officials to credit rating agencies, economists to political parties, have started discussing the minimum wage figure months in advance, Atalay said that as the minimum wage is discussed, price increases for products and services have begun. Atalay expressed that the minimum wage, which is the base wage, has turned into a living wage for a large portion of workers over time, stating that the minimum wage figure affects more than 20 items, including severance pay, unemployment benefits, and General Health Insurance premiums. Atalay pointed out that the minimum wage is the largest Collective Labor Agreement (TİS) in Turkey, stating: \"Therefore, we should not only view the minimum wage as a salary. The minimum wage in 2025 should be at a level that allows the worker and their family to live decently according to the current economic and social conditions, in line with human dignity. Our colleagues will determine this figure in the coming days. This figure will be presented to the TÜRK-İŞ Board of Presidents and then shared with the public.\" Atalay added, \"It is not possible to accept the figures circulating in the public that some circles have mentioned. Those figures are not ones that will make society happy.\" Commission member Durmuş Öztürk stated that he represented workers in the Minimum Wage Determination Commission last year as well, mentioning that he has been working as a subcontractor for 11 years and receiving minimum wage. Öztürk expressed that he will be the voice of both subcontractor workers and minimum wage earners in the Commission, stating that they want a figure that will improve the living conditions of workers. Hairdresser Nihan Koçak also mentioned that she has rent for her home, saying, \"I separated from my spouse 5 years ago. I am struggling to live with my children, and I am having a hard time. We will work in the Commission with the voice of minimum wage earners.\" she said. Press member Sezer Özseven stated that he has been a journalist for three years and has an income at the minimum wage level. Expressing that it is not possible to make ends meet with the current minimum wage under today's conditions, Özseven evaluated, \"The minimum wage needs to increase as much as the expected inflation; otherwise, it does not cover the rent and food expenses of the workers.\" Chef Selma Sayın also stated, \"We want a good minimum wage figure for the improvement of living conditions.\"",

    "text": "Los populares parques temáticos de Disney de Orlando, en el centro de Florida (EE.UU.), abrirán de nuevo sus puertas al público este viernes, tras el cierre temporal por la llegada del huracán Milton, que tocó tierra en la noche del miércoles y cruzó el estado de oeste a este. \"Estamos agradecidos de que Walt Disney World Resort haya resistido la tormenta y actualmente estamos evaluando los impactos en nuestra propiedad para prepararnos para reabrir los parques temáticos, Disney Springs y posiblemente otras áreas el viernes 11 de octubre\", dijo este jueves Walt Disney World en su sitio web. La empresa expresó su solidaridad con los floridanos que se vieron afectados por Milton, que ha cobrado al menos la vida de una docena de personas y dejado una senda de destrucción a su paso, con tornados mortales, graves inundaciones y cortes de electricidad que todavía afectan a tres millones de usuarios. El complejo de entretenimiento, ubicado a 20 millas (32 kilómetros) al suroeste de Orlando, que sufrió fuertes lluvias y cortes de energía, cerró sus parques temáticos el miércoles por la tarde, horas antes del embate del huracán, que entró por la costa oeste central de Florida. Así pues, los parques temáticos Disney's Animal Kingdom, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Magic Kingdom, EPCOT y Disney Spring reabrirán el viernes desde primeras horas de la mañana. Permanecen cerrados por remodelación La Princesa de Cristal y Jungle Cruise. De igual manera, el Centro Espacial Kennedy de la NASA, ubicado en la costa este de Florida, anunció hoy que reabrirá sus puertas a los visitantes el próximo sábado a partir de las 9:00 hora local (13:00 GMT). La agencia espacial cerró el miércoles sus instalaciones y activó el \"estado de confinamiento\", una fase denominada 'HURCON', a la espera de la inminente llegada del huracán Milton. Se espera que todas las atracciones, exhibiciones y eventos programados, así como el recorrido en autobús por el centro espacial, estén abiertos en su horario habitual. \"El complejo para visitantes del Centro Espacial Kennedy estará aquí para apoyar a la comunidad y a los miembros de nuestra tripulación mientras comienzan a reparar y reconstruir\" las zonas dañadas tras el golpe de Milton. Mientras Florida hace recuento de las víctimas y daños causados por Milton, el huracán se convirtió hoy en un fenómeno extratropical en aguas del Atlántico, a 320 kilómetros al este-noreste de Cabo Cañaveral, en la costa oeste de Florida.

The women, six police officers and five staff members of the Gambetta high school, were knighted in the promotion of the Legion of Honor on January 1, published on Sunday in the Official Journal. Eleven people who intervened in the attack in Arras, in the Pas-de-Calais region, on 13 October, six police officers and five staff from the Gambetta high school, have been knighted in the promotion of the Legion of Honour on 1 January, published on Sunday in the Official Journal. Professor Dominique Bernard, stabbed to death in front of his secondary school in Arras by a radicalized former student, was posthumously elevated to the rank of knight by the presidency of the Republic immediately after the attack. 352 people working \"in the service of the general interest\" In total, the new civilian promotion of the Legion of Honor, the highest of France's national distinctions, rewards \"on an equal footing\" 352 people working \"in the service of the general interest,\" the Grand Chancellery said in a statement. Illustrious or unknown to the general public, these people are divided into different ranks (knights, officers, commanders, etc.). Two join the prestigious circle of the Grand Cross, the highest dignity of the Legion of Honor held by only 68 other people: the haematologist Dominique Meyer, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and the CEO of the world's number one luxury goods group LVMH, Bernard Arnault. >> ALSO READ – Arras attack: the slain professor, Dominique Bernard, made a Knight of the Legion of Honour Also in the sciences, two winners of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Frenchman Pierre Agostini and the Franco-Swedish Anne L'Huillier, have been promoted to Commanders, as have the astronaut Jean-François Clervoy and the child psychiatrist Marcel Rufo.

Some 79,000 members Sitting ministers and parliamentarians cannot be appointed, but former centrist minister Jean-Louis Borloo is promoted to officer, and former Castex government minister Elisabeth Moreno, president of Femmes@Numérique, becomes a knight. France's ambassador to Iran Nicolas Roche, former chief of staff to Jean-Yves Le Drian when he was foreign minister, is also knighted. >> ALSO READ – The Legion of Honour soon to be withdrawn from Gérard Depardieu?

For the arts, the composer Vladimir Cosma was promoted to officer. The so-called January 1 and July 14 classes are the two annual civilian promotions of the Legion of Honor, which now has some 79,000 members.

    "text": "Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) National President and the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati on Friday welcomed the decision of the Delhi University Vice Chancellor to reject a proposal to include 'Manusmriti' in the syllabus of its Law Faculty stating that strong opposition was natural and the decision to cancel this proposal was a welcome step.\"Strong opposition to the proposal to teach Manusmriti in the Law Department of Delhi University, which goes against the honour and dignity of the Indian Constitution and its egalitarian and welfare objectives, is natural and the decision to cancel this proposal is a welcome step,\" she said in a post on social media platform X.She further stated that the Manusmriti doesn't match the principles on which Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the Indian Constitution and such attempts to include the Manusmriti in the curriculum were not appropriate.\"His Holiness Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the universally accepted Indian Constitution, especially keeping the self-respect of the neglected people and women as well as humanism and secularism at the core, which does not match with Manusmriti at all. Therefore, any such attempt is not appropriate at all,\" Mayawati further stated.Also read: No 'Manusmriti' for LLB students: DU VC issues clarification, says proposal rejectedOn Thursday, Delhi University Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Yogesh Singh, announced that the proposal to include the Sanskrit text 'Manusmriti' or Laws of Manu, which belongs to the Dharmastra literary tradition of Hinduism, in the LLB curriculum was rejected.Also read: Vocabulary Made Easy series: Word hard to taste success in competitive exams\"Yesterday, some information came to us that Manusmriti will be part of the Law Faculty course (in DU). I inquired and talked to the Delhi University Vice Chancellor. He assured me that some law faculty members have proposed some changes in the jurisprudence chapter. But when the proposal came to the Delhi University administration, today there is an Academic Council meeting. There is no endorsement of any such proposal by the authentic body of the Academic Council. Yesterday itself, the Vice Chancellor rejected that proposal. We are all committed to our Constitution and to a futuristic approach. The government is committed to upholding the true spirit and letter of the Constitution. There is no question of including any controversial portion of any script,\" said Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.",
