And then we want you – Diablo admirers – so you can vote on their preferred. But also for me personally, while Diablo 3 is incredibly fun and i like things like running an increased Rift and only blowing upwards monsters it’s merely enjoyable for including, an hour or two. I am not effective in only playing the online game for half dozen days every night. I’m not good from the doing one thing for grand chunks of your energy. We wear’t determine if I’ve ADHD or if We’m merely old and you may exhausted, however, desperately seeking force account isn’t my cup teas.\nDiablo cuatro participants is actually enjoying 12 months 7 however, there’s a big condition The course are awesome slow, Hydra is certainly bugged. I believe and needs an entire change. Blizzard acknowledge that it themselves however, didn’t create far in order to balance it or fan it.\nSavage Frenzied Barbarian Grim Dawn provides a good gritty, post-apocalyptic globe in which people create paths with strong character customization and engaging matches. Road from Exile offers an intricate ability web and you will an intricate product system, welcoming players on the a dark, immersive knowledge of an effective discussion board. Torchlight II brings together brilliant images having addicting gameplay, providing co-op multiplayer and you may an enchanting realm of giants and you will treasures. See these or other games such as Diablo 3 inside our rated checklist less than. The fresh sorcerer is very nerfed and you can bugged.\nThe sole bug I am aware out of are while you are secure, mobs is’t be made insecure/aren’t influenced by vulnerable multipliers, and that Sorc have a huge amount of. It’s not so much that there isn’t something, but simply that lots of participants think the method has been somewhat repeated and too simple. We didn’t hightail it away from mobs, however it appeared like just about any mob faced (that the game is actually the a couple of moments, unfortunately) is actually without difficulty passing easily wasn’t careful. In that way, players find out more about Diablo step three and check out the fresh brands to measure the gameplay. Getting a sweaty gamer is not my personal idea of enjoyable and you will while i took my CL woman as much as, and you can accomplished lvl 86 regarding the pit groing through you to definitely lvl wasn’t enjoyable therefore i don’t go truth be told there. We have 14 letters overall 4 of which get reused to possess regular gamble. One which stays long lasting ‘s the eternal cl girl. To possess me, even if, it’s very nice in order to relax and enjoy one hour otherwise a couple of Diablo 3 at the conclusion of a stressful go out rather than so it is a supply of worry too. Another way to enjoy Diablo 3 is the regular incidents you to definitely are around for able to the participants. These types of situations present the new tips to render a new change to the online game relevant to the times of year.\nRecruit-A-Pal Program That it prize program is not only best for you and also for the pal, just who is now offering a chance to obtain the extra also.

We didn’t hightail it out of mobs, nonetheless it seemed like almost every mob confronted (that this game are all the two mere seconds, unfortunately) is actually with ease death if i wasn’t mindful. Personally i think such as around twenty-five is the place you start to feel strong in comparison to before. I’yards still min/nax ing my character…playing with a good clan and a lot of posts to do and you will appear.

    "text": "PUBG: Battlegrounds is dropping support for PS4 and Xbox One\nThe console version will soon only be a current-gen experience.\nPUBG: Battlegrounds\n- System: PC, PS4, Stadia, Xbox One\n- Genre:\nAction - Developer:\nBluehole Studio,Brendan Greene,PUBG Corp - Publisher:\nInc.,Bluehole - Online players: 1-100\n- Release date: 20 December 2017\nRead entire review\nDespite the still massive number of players that frequently use a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox One, now that we're almost five years into this current-generation of hardware, we are seeing more and more developers and publishers move away from the last-gen consoles. This is in part to be able to tailor games and improve them to the degree that the more recent hardware allows, seeing them blossom on more modern systems. The latest of the bunch is Krafton and the PUBG: Battlegrounds Team, who has revealed that the battle royale is transitioning away from PS4 and Xbox One support.\nIn a blog post, it's revealed that on November 13, PUBG on console will no longer be supported on PS4 and Xbox One, and that rather it will only be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The reason being is explained as such:\n\"This shift is a necessary step toward aligning PUBG Console with current-gen consoles. To provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates, we've decided to transition to current-gen consoles. Following this transition, console players will see improved visuals and more stable frame rates. In addition, we expect to reduce ongoing crash issues through memory-related optimizations.\"\nUnlike some games that steadily sunset features, PUBG will simply not be downloadable nor playable on PS4/Xbox One from November 13, meaning if you're a console PUBG player, you have around three months to transition to the latest batch of consoles to continue hunting for Chicken Dinners.\nAfter the transition, we can expect the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S editions to have updated specs that affect resolution and frame rate. Soon, we can expect the game to perform as the following on current-gen systems.\nXbox Series S:\n- Resolution - 1080p/1440p\n- FPS - 60fps/30fps\nXbox Series X:\n- Resolution - 2160p\n- FPS - 60fps\nPS5:\n- Resolution - 1440p\n- FPS - 60fps\nPS5 Pro:\n- Resolution - 2160p\n- FPS - 60fps\nIt should be said that the Xbox Series X and the PS5 Pro (but not the PS5) will support dynamic 4K resolution too.\nThe developer signs off with: \"As mentioned earlier, this transition to current-gen consoles is not only aimed at providing a more stable environment, but also at preparing for larger updates in the future. It marks an important step forward for the long-term growth of PUBG Console, and will allow us to respond more swiftly to the evolving needs of the console ecosystem.\"",

    "title": "Teamsters Canada calls CN, CPKC lockout threat ‘escalation’ as strike looms",
    "text": "Negotiators for Teamsters Canada, the union that represents railroad workers, and railroads CN and CPKC are scheduled to sit down Friday for another round of arbitration. American Shipper reached out to the parties to get their assessments before this historic meeting.\nThe outcome of these discussions comes at a critical time for the logistics industry, which is in the midst of peak season. The Canada Industrial Relations Board ruled on Aug. 9 that “a work stoppage on Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) would not cause an immediate threat to public health and safety.”\nThe Canadian government asked the CIRB in early May to review any safety implications if there was a strike. This ruling created the likelihood of a lockout by Aug. 22.\nCPKC announced that if no settlement is reached and there is no agreement to binding interest arbitration with union leadership, it will issue notice to the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) – Train and Engine (T&E) division and TCRC – Rail Traffic Controller (RCTC) division of its plan to lock out employees on Aug. 22.\nCN also announced that unless there is meaningful progress at the negotiating table or arbitration, CN will have no choice but to initiate further embargoes and ultimately lock out employees as of 12:01 a.m. ET on Aug. 22.\nIn a special series, American Shipper asked Teamsters Canada as well as CPKC and CN to offer updates before they resume negotiations. The following exchange is with a spokesperson for Teamsters Canada.\nFREIGHTWAVES: How far apart are the talks? Should the logistics industry brace for a strike?\nTEAMSTERS CANADA: Teamsters Canada agrees with Minister MacKinnon: agreements are within reach at the bargaining table. It bears repeating that the main sticking points at the bargaining table are company demands, not union proposals. The only way forward is for the rail companies to engage in genuine negotiations at the bargaining table, and to back down from their demands for concessions.\nBoth companies have decided to begin lockouts on Aug. 22. With close to two weeks of negotiations still ahead, this move represents an unnecessary escalation that goes against the principles of good faith bargaining that CN and CPKC claim to uphold.\nA work stoppage can still be avoided, but only if CN and CPKC are willing to engage in genuine negotiations. Our union is committed to negotiating, but we have yet to find willing partners in CN and CPKC.\nA breakthrough at the bargaining table is still possible, provided the companies back down from their demands for concessions on issues such as rail safety, fatigue management, forced relocation and crew scheduling.\nCN and CPKC have a responsibility to their employees and to all Canadians, and we urge these companies to act in a manner that reflects this duty.\nFREIGHTWAVES: What are the companies specifically demanding that will threaten the safety of workers and the running of the rails?\nTEAMSTERS CANADA: The main sticking points at the bargaining table are company demands, not union proposals. Both companies want concessions on issues pertaining to crew scheduling, rail safety and fatigue management.\nRailroaders work grueling on-call schedules, making it extremely difficult to consistently show up to work rested and fit for duty. We have made significant progress in addressing these issues over the years through stronger regulations and collective agreements. Now, both companies claim to be struggling with labor shortages and want to roll back fatigue protections to increase crew availability, regardless of the risks.\nCPKC wants to gut the collective agreement of safety-critical fatigue provisions. Some of the targeted language currently helps workers better anticipate when they might be called to work. Gutting these provisions would force train crews to stay awake even longer, increasing the risk of derailments and other accidents. CPKC has also failed to address the understaffing of rail traffic controllers.\nMeanwhile, CN is targeting fewer contract provisions around fatigue but still enough to raise safety concerns. Their demand to extend workdays in all provinces west of Ontario is of particular concern. CN aims to implement a forced relocation scheme, which would see workers ordered to move across the country for months at a time to fill labor shortages, tearing families apart in the process.\nCompromising on safety, or threatening to tear families apart for months at a time, are not pathways to an agreement or solutions to staffing problems. CN and CPKC should instead be looking to improve working conditions and adopt a more humane approach to railroading to attract more workers.\nFREIGHTWAVES: Is there any compromise in these areas or has the red line been drawn?\nTEAMSTERS CANADA: We certainly hope the companies will see reason. It bears repeating that the main sticking points are company demands, not union proposals.\nFrom the very beginning, rail workers have only ever sought a fair and equitable agreement. Unfortunately, both rail companies are demanding concessions that could tear families apart or jeopardize rail safety. Rail workers have fought for a safer and more humane industry for decades, and we will not accept moving backwards.\nFREIGHTWAVES: How long do you plan on striking? Days? Months?\nTEAMSTERS CANADA: The issue has shifted from a possible strike to a near-certain lockout, with rail companies beginning today to embargo shipments in preparation for a shutdown of their operations. Given these developments, a better question might be: How far are the rail companies willing to go to get their way?\nFREIGHTWAVES: Will the workers picket at the ports, and should the ports expect the International Longshore & Warehouse Union Canada to stand by your workers and not cross the picket, essentially shutting down the ports?\nTEAMSTERS CANADA: At this time, we have no plans to picket ports, and this tactic has not been brought up in any of our internal strike planning.",

    "text": "Presidente de México culpa a traficantes de personas de organizar caravanas migrantes AMLO señaló a los traficantes de personas como los organizadores de las caravanas de migrantes como la que actualmente está cruzando el sur de México hacia Estados Unidos El presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, señaló el jueves a los traficantes de personas de organizar las caravanas de migrantes, como la que avanza por el sur de ese país y que es considerada como la más numerosa del año. “Se alienta la migración, se desinforma, hay también los traficantes de personas que se dedican a eso y organizan caravanas para llegar a Estados Unidos, muchas veces no informando a la gente”, expresó López Obrador en la conferencia mañanera de hoy, desde el Palacio Nacional. Y tenemos que seguir nosotros cuidando a los migrantes, evitando que corran peligro, evitando los riesgos”. Sus declaraciones se producen durante el avance de la caravana migrante que partió en Nochebuena desde Tapachula, en la frontera sur de México, con casi 10,000 personas como la más numerosa del año y ahora está atravesando por el municipio de Escuintla, en el estado de Chiapas. El avance de la caravana presionó al gobierno de México [durante la visita de este miércoles de una delegación de Estados Unidos](https://eldiariony.com/2023/12/27/caravana-migrante-sigue-avanzando-en-mexico-en-medio-de-la-presencia-de-funcionarios-estadounidenses/) encabezada por los secretarios de Estado, Antony Blinken, y de Seguridad Nacional, Alejandro Mayorkas, para abordar el inédito repunte del flujo migratorio en diciembre. Pero, cuestionado por una periodista, el gobernante mexicano rechazó que el grupo de migrantes fuese aún tan numeroso, al señalar que se ha dispersado. “En el caso de esta caravana, ya se han ido quedando en el sureste, porque hablas de 8,000, el informe de hoy creo que ya es de 1,500, lo que hoy hace un momento me informaron”, aseveró. El grupo avanza mientras en el mes de diciembre se registran cifras históricas de personas que buscan entrar a Estados Unidos en la frontera con México, donde la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza estadounidense (CBP) confirmó el martes [la llegada de más de 2.2 millones de migrantes de enero a noviembre.](https://eldiariony.com/2023/12/23/autoridades-sorprendidas-ante-el-numero-record-de-migrantes-en-la-frontera-en-medio-de-aumento-sin-precedentes/) Sobre su reunión con la delegación de Estados Unidos, López Obrador expuso que insistió a los funcionarios en la necesidad de invertir en cooperación para el desarrollo con los países de Centroamérica al asegurar que la política de México es proteger a los migrantes. “Hablamos sobre la atención a las causas que originan la migración, el apoyo a países en donde por necesidad la gente tiene que abandonar sus pueblos en busca de trabajo, se informó de cómo nuestro país sigue ayudando”, dijo el presidente de México.

    "title": "SEE IT: UK Tests Laser Weapon Called DragonFire That Can Shoot Down Missiles for Just $12 a Shot",
    "text": "A laser powerful enough to shoot down targets for the cost of running a heater for an hour was successfully tested by the British military, with sights now set on finally bringing the advanced tech into service. The DragonFire laser's successful test by the UK Ministry of Defense follows years of investigations and testing around the world, including during President Reagan's term , when the technology was first floated as part of a way to replace nuclear weapons. While the range of the laser is being kept secret, the ministry said it could hit a £1 coin - about the size of a U.S. quarter - from around 0.6 miles away. Firing the intense beam of energy, which can cut through metal, typically costs less than £10 ($12) a shot. \"This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage,\" Defense Secretary Grant Shapp said in a press release. \"Investments with industry partners in advanced technologies like DragonFire are crucial in a highly contested world, helping us maintain the battle-winning edge and keep the nation safe.\" The MoD said that the successful test, completed in Scotland, was a major step forward in bringing the technology into service after it was used to track moving air and sea targets previously. \"This is a really innovative application of science and engineering and is the fruit of sustained investment and effort,\" Dr. Nick Joad, from the Defense Ministry's Defense Science and Technology (DST) organization, said. \"DragonFire uses cutting-edge science and technology and delivers much greater performance than other systems of a similar class. DragonFire provides a step-change in our ability to deal with high-performance and low-cost threats.\" The United States carried out its own successful tests in 2022 , with the Navy also touting the technology's potential to cut costs and bolster the U.S.'s ability to take out threats .\nThe Pentagon has signed contracts with a major weapons manufacturer to bring the lasers onto the battlefield as soon as next year.",

(First Alert 4) - A man admitted in a St. Louis court that he fatally stabbed a woman during a dispute at a gas station. Booker T. Boyd, 53, pleaded guilty Thursday to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in the Aug. 21, 2023, killing of Natalie Stepney. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. Charging documents state that surveillance video at the Gas Mart at 5745 Delmar Boulevard showed an argument between Boyd and Stepney near the front door of the business. During the argument, Boyd threw what appeared to be a sandwich at Stepney, after which Stepney hit Boyd with a garbage can lid. Stepney was then stabbed in the chest with a pocket knife. During the sentencing hearing, Boyd said he had seen Stepney but had barely spoken with her before the argument. He admitted their argument “got physical” and led to him stabbing her in the chest with a pocket knife. Copyright 2024 KMOV. All rights reserved.",
