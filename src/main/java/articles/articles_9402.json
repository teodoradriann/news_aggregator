    "text": "Widespread rains lashed parts of Tamil Nadu on Thursday, prompting authorities to declare a holiday for schools in Chennai and many other districts. With the people yet to come to terms with the devastation caused in 14 districts across Tamil Nadu by Cyclone Fengal, the intense rain throughout the state inundated several areas and submerged standing crops in the districts.\nIn Chennai, apprehensive of destruction to their cars, many residents parked their vehicles on the Velachery flyover. At many places in the city people had to confront knee-deep water even on the arterial roads and many residential areas were flooded due to the rain since Wednesday night.\n“We didn’t want to take the risk of losing our cars, so we parked our vehicles on the flyover,\" a resident of Velachery said.\nTraffic at Kathipara, Poonammallee, Porur, Maduravoyal, Vysarpadi, and Chennai suburbs came to a standstill with all sorts of vehicles getting stranded in the rainwater.\n<a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/fpj-shorts\">\nSevere Rains Affect Tamil Nadu, Schools Closed In Chennai & Surrounding Areas\n</a> <a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/fpj-shorts\">\nAILET 2025 Result Declared At nationallawuniversitydelhi.in; CHECK NOW!\n</a> <a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/fpj-shorts\">\n'Want To Be Youngest World Chess Champion': Old Video Of D Gukesh Revealing His Aspiration Viral After Teen Prodigy Makes His Dream Come True\n</a> <a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/fpj-shorts\">\nConstitution Debate To Begin In Lok Sabha Today; Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Likely To Make Her Maiden Speech\n</a>\nResidents of Vyasarpadi and Pallavaram complained that water logging in their areas during monsoon has become a regular feature. They hoped the civic authorities would ensure an effective mechanism to drain excess flood water and make the roads safe and motorable.\nAt least three subways here were heavily inundated with rainwater, forcing the civic body to temporarily shut them. Efforts were on to bail out the water.\nSeveral areas in Thiruvannamalai, which had experienced mud slips atleast four times when Cyclone Fengal crossed the Tamil Nadu and Karaikal coast on November 30, and some parts in the southern districts, as well, were swarmed by swathes of water.\nAn NDRF team has been deployed at Thiruvannamalai, equipped with advanced disaster management equipment to respond to any emergency, an official said.\nIn Thiruvannamalai, the Sri Arunachaleswar temple staff and volunteers braved the downpour to carry the 6.5 feet high copper cauldron (koparai) with the Lord’s name on their lips, to place it atop the 2,668 feet high mountain to light the Maha Deepam on December 13 evening. The lighting of the gigantic ghee lamp on the hill top marks the conclusion of the annual 10-day Karthiga deepam festival at the renowned temple. The Bharani deepam will be lit at the temple on Friday morning.\n<a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/bomb-threat-sent-to-delhi-schools-via-e-mail-again-after-44-schools-received-hoax-mails-on-dec-9-searches-underway-visuals-surface\">Bomb Threat Sent To Delhi Schools Via E-mail Again After 44 Schools Received Hoax Mails On Dec 9,...\n</a>\nAccording to a source in Public Works Department (PWD) the reservoirs and tanks in the state which were replenished due to heavy downpour triggered by the recent cyclone, were now receiving copious inflows. The water level in many dams reached 60 to 80 percent, he said.\nFollowing a sudden increase in the inflows into the Sathanur dam in Thiruvannamalai district that sharply surged the water level, about 13,000 cusecs water was released from the reservoir today. In Chennai, about 1,000 cusecs water was released from the Poondi dam, one of the chief sources of drinking water to the metro, in the afternoon and the quantum was gradually increased to about 5,000 cusecs in the evening, PWD said.\nThe water level in the Chembarambakkam dam here inched towards the full reservoir level. Its present level stood at 21.90 feet against its full level capacity of 24 feet. It’s storage increased to 84.88 percent owing to heavy rain in the catchment areas.\nThe six lakes/dams supplying drinking water to Chennai with a total storage capacity of 13,213 Mcft water at present have a combined storage of 10,487 Mcft water that is 79.37 percent.\nThe state government has urged people in the low lying areas to remain vigilant and take appropriate action. It said 2,000 cusecs of surplus water will be released from Pichatur reservoir into the Arani river.\n“The state received 16 per cent more than normal rainfall during this North East Monsoon which commenced on October 15. The NEM is likely to intensify and last till mid-January 2025,\" IMD Regional Meteorological Centre director S Balachandran said.\nThe well-marked low pressure area which lay centred in the Mannar Bay will weaken into a depression in the next 12 hours causing heavy to very heavy rainfall activity in the coastal and interior districts of Tamil Nadu, he told reporters here.\nBalachandran said there was an indication of another system forming in the Andaman Sea on December 15.\nFollowing the heavy rainfall warning issued by the IMD, six NDRF teams have been alerted to swing into rescue and relief activity in case of emergency, the government said.\nOvernight rains lashed Chennai and the neighbouring Tiruvallur, Chengelpet and Kancheepuram, besides Villupuram and some areas in the Cauvery delta region.\nFollowing sharp showers, authorities declared a day’s holiday for schools in districts, including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengelpet, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore.\nThe regional weather office has forecast more spells of rain in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengelpet and Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur districts in the state, besides the neighbouring union territory Puducherry.\nPaddy crop ready for harvest in Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts was submerged in rainwater.\nThree electric poles collapsed due to heavy rain near Mannargudi in Thiruvarur district, said police.",

    "title": "Subaru and Make-A-Wish Create Joyous Memories for Families",
    "text": "Children’s greatest wishes are coming true in the Chicago suburbs. From family vacations to bedroom makeovers, Autobarn Subaru of Countryside and Make-A-Wish Illinois are helping to create irreplaceable experiences for critically ill children and their families. “Over the past eight years that Autobarn has worked with Make-A-Wish, the retailer has granted more than 35 wishes for children in the community,” said Richard Fisher, managing partner of Autobarn, a long-time family business. “We’re very lucky to be involved with Subaru and Make-A-Wish. It makes us feel good, too. We’re a local business, and we care about the community and its businesses.” “They truly understand that a wish is not just a fleeting moment in time, but a journey that provides hope, strength and joy to children when they need it most,” added Stephanie Eckert, corporate gift officer for Make-A-Wish Illinois. “This is the best promise that Subaru and Autobarn Subaru of Countryside can make to the children in our community – that they will be there to ensure their wish journey will be a magical experience of discovery and joy.” Subaru of America has partnered with Make-A-Wish for the past 12 years as part of the Subaru Love Promise , the company’s commitment to be a positive force in the communities where employees live and work. It’s the largest automotive donor to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and, together with its retailers, Subaru has donated over $32 million to help grant more than 3,300 wishes nationwide. Autobarn Subaru of Countryside selected Make-A-Wish as its hometown charity through the annual Subaru Share the Love Event . During the annual charitable initiative, which is held between November and January, Subaru and its participating retailers donate at least $250 to a customer’s chosen national or hometown charity for every new vehicle purchase or lease. “The Share the Love Event with Subaru is something special,” Fisher said. “Together with Subaru, we don’t just say, we do. Subaru really puts its money where its mouth is. And 12 years later, it’s still going strong. It’s not a one-time thing.” About three dozen Autobarn Subaru of Countryside employees also participated in the Walk for Wishes fundraiser for Make-A-Wish Illinois, along with a host of movie characters that added to the excitement for younger participants. “Our team wanted to get involved personally,” Fisher said. “It’s a feel-good thing … It makes you realize life is special, and you appreciate it more.” That involvement means something for the dealer, employer and customer, he added. “You feel a part of something that gives back, which is what employees want. It’s not just writing a check and moving on.” Wish requests vary widely. “People are different about what they want and love,” Fisher said. No matter the wish, family reactions are among the most rewarding parts of the program. “Just seeing someone smile — when you see someone who doesn’t have it easy, when you see them able to smile and have a good time, that’s what it comes down to,” Fisher said. Recipients’ families are celebrated together when the wishes are granted, and after the wishes are fulfilled, families often return to the retailer for a reception. A trip to her favorite California theme park was one kid’s wish, and they were able to get the support they needed to make it possible. Their daughter uses a wheelchair, has a seizure disorder and a genetic disorder, and is non-verbal. “The family doesn’t have it easy,” Fisher said. “But just to see the family be able to take a break and have a vacation, just seeing the dad and mom sharing such a loving interaction with their daughter [was gratifying].” One boy wished for his whole bedroom to be remodeled with a new bed, TV monitors and a game console. “If you are 12, that’s your dream to have all the cool stuff,” he said. “The Autobarn Subaru of Countryside, its owners, employees, and customers truly ‘share the love’ and embrace the power of wish, not just during the holiday season, but throughout the whole year,” the Make-A-Wish Illinois representative said. “We could not be more grateful for the support.” The team at Autobarn Subaru of Countryside also supports other causes locally. They donate blankets, hats and gloves to local shelters, supports local public schools through volunteering and other projects, and work with the local humane society by sponsoring an adoption event to help dogs find forever homes, during which the retailer covers adoption fees. “We try to help any way we can,” Fisher said. “We try and stay as involved as we can. We do it because it’s the right thing to do.” Fisher encouraged people and corporations to pitch in where they live, too. “I always tell more people to get involved — it’s the most rewarding thing you can do. If you have the means to do so, you should. We’re very focused on what we can do, and whatever it takes to make people happy. If we hadn’t gotten involved, we might not have been able to share in their joy.” This article series is sponsored by Subaru of America and produced by the TriplePundit editorial team. Ellen R.

    "text": "El presidente del Consejo de Ministros, Gustavo Adrianzén, afirmó que desde el Poder Ejecutivo se apuesta por el desarrollo de la selva, al impulsar diversos proyectos de desarrollo que permitirán mejorar la calidad de vida de los peruanos.\nPoco antes, durante la clausura de la Mesa de Trabajo para la Articulación para el Desarrollo Territorial de los Pueblos Indígenas, Adrianzén señaló que se apuesta por el desarrollo a través de diversos proyectos para cuya ejecución se gestionan los fondos correspondientes.\nDirigiéndose a la población y a las autoridades presentes, Adrianzén señaló que varios de los 79 proyectos que existen y que “son demandados por ustedes”, contarán en su ejecución con la participación de la población local.\n“Es una apuesta por la selva central” , manifestó el titular de la Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros.\nSu realización permitirá “comunicarnos, unirnos e integrarnos”, agregó. Asimismo, indicó que los fondos llegarán cuando la Comisión Permanente del Congreso apruebe un proyecto de ley que el Ejecutivo ha enviado para el otorgamiento de un crédito suplementario.\nInforme de Amnistía Internacional\nDe otro lado, expresó su rechazo al informe de la organización Amnistía Internacional, que responsabiliza al gobierno peruano por las muertes ocurridas entre diciembre de 2022 y los primeros meses de 2023 en el contexto de protestas políticas.\n“La ONG que ha presentado ese informe no hace sino ratificar a través de este el sesgo político con el que fue elaborado su informe del año pasado, donde habló de racismo letal’”, indicó, en rueda de prensa realizada en Satipo, Junín.\nEn ese sentido, dijo que desde el gobierno “rechazamos rotundamente cada uno de los apartados de este informe”. “No aceptamos que se sigan instrumentalizando esos hechos con fines políticos, cuando no económicos” , añadió. “Los negamos en principio, más aun cuando, de manera indebida y absolutamente inconsecuente, se le pretende atribuir a la Presidenta una responsabilidad mediata en los lamentables hechos ocurridos” , expresó Adrianzén.\nEl titular del gabinete dijo también que la mandataria se ha pronunciado sobre lo ocurrido y que desde el gobierno “nos solidarizamos con los deudos” de los fallecidos.\n[Lea también: PJ rechaza amparo presentado por defensa legal de mandataria ]\nAcompañaron a Adrianzén en esta jornada los ministros del Interior, Juan José Santiváñez; de Desarrollo Agrario y Riego, Ángel Manero, y de Cultura, Leslie Urteaga.\n(FIN) FGM/JCR\nMás en Andina:\nCon una romería rinden homenaje a los excombatientes del conflicto de 1941 en Tumbes https://t.co/Tq4FfDPcaK pic.twitter.com/NaB2TVdcPv\n— Agencia Andina (@Agencia_Andina) July 18, 2024",

    "title": "'I dodged Storm Gerrit carnage with pub trip – Wetherspoons pint may have saved my life' - Daily Star",
    "text": "A man has claimed a pint saved his life during the \"pure carnage\" of Storm Gerrit , which has left homes in the UK completely destroyed. Frightful scenes were seen of houses in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester of an \"absolute disaster\" which left property owners reeling from terrible damages. A \"localised tornado\" brought on by the storm is believed to have been the cause. Despite the strong gusts of wind and property damage, the tornado lasted just 15 seconds, with local Andy Turner describing the tragic damages as \"pure carnage\".

He has since spoken out on what he believed was a \" hurricane \" which has left his wife's car beyond repair while his own vehicle was bashed by a tree. Speaking to The Sun , Andy said: \"At 11.30pm last night, there was - all I can describe - is a hurricane came through. It lasted for about 15 seconds. Cars were parked outside the house. My wife's car is a write-off. My car took a bit of the brunt of the tree. \"It's just lucky that nobody was hurt. It was pure carnage.\" Fellow resident Euan Walsh, 21, has credited popping out for a pint as having saved his life after a last-minute change of plans. The Cherry Grove resident said: \"I was in Wetherspoons when it happened. The windows from the Bistro next to it came in. I just finished work and I was going to walk home when I decided to go to the pub - so a pint saved my life possibly.\" Dad Kevin Welsh, 57, added: \"I was watching the Woman in Black when I heard all this noise outside. I've lived here for 36 years and never experienced anything like this – we do get strong winds but only in one direction, this came from every direction and lasted all of one minute.\" Other residents were spooked, not by the Daniel Radcliffe-starring horror flick but by longer-term damage from the \"25 to 30 seconds storm\". Resident Matthew Marsland said the whole incident lasted just half a minute, but the impact was brutal. He said: \"I heard extreme noise at my back window. I was stood at my patio door and there was just basically a crazy sounding noise and then vibrations through the glass. I looked out of the window and saw a bit of debris so I thought I'd go out and pick a few bits up. \"Then I saw a piece of tree next to my neighbour's car, then I looked further along the street and saw a gutter in the middle of the street so I thought I'd go and pick that up, and then I saw my neighbour had had half his house torn off.\" Crushed cars, battered houses and in some instances whole rooftops blown off and away by the storm, were seen in gnarly pictures procured from the street. Lyndsey Moody, another resident on the street, believes her son's life was saved by his love of video games. She said: \"We were lucky that no one was killed. \"The chimney took out an internal wall and my son's bedroom. If he hadn't been on his computer chair with wheels it probably would have killed him. Half of the roof is hanging over the pavement so we are trying not make that safe.\" Insurance company ABI spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: \"Insurers expect and are ready for any type of bad weather, such as tornado-force winds. Anyone who has suffered damage should contact their insurer for advice.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking https://www.dailystar.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/.",

    "title": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians | KMUW",
    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.
