    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - New Orleans officials are taking steps to prevent future utility disruptions after a Mylar balloon hitting power lines led to a boil water advisory affecting nearly the entire city.\nThe New Orleans City Council is reviewing the response to the incident, which resulted in an employee injury at the Sewerage and Water Board.\nEntergy reported that while the Sewerage and Water Board retained electricity, a brief voltage dip caused by the balloon created significant problems.\n“We never lost power, but that momentary dip in voltage is what they experienced,” said Steven Benyard, Entergy’s VP of Reliability.\nThe City Council is focusing on improving public education about the dangers of Mylar balloons, though it is not considering a ban. Instead, officials want to collaborate with Entergy to raise awareness about the risks balloons pose to power lines.\n“The risk reward of having Mylar balloons versus people being in the dark,” said JP Morrell, New Orleans City Council Vice-President. “When a Mylar balloon hits a powerline and causes an outage, it’s not just the outage, but the repairs which are born by ratepayers.”\nFollowing the incident, an employee at the Sewerage and Water Board was seriously injured when a hatch blew off. Emergency services were called minutes after the accident.\nRELATED STORIES\nMetallic balloon hits power line, plunges nearly all of New Orleans into boil water advisory, officials say Operator’s ‘serious injury’ delayed preventing citywide boil water advisory, officials say Councilman questions staffing, timeline of events leading to citywide boil advisory Ghassan Korban, Executive Director of the Sewerage and Water Board, believes that if the employee had not been injured, power would have been restored more quickly, avoiding the boil water advisory.\n“I can sit here and tell you that I would have done exactly what they did that night,” Korban said.\nNew Orleans City Council member Joe Giarusso stressed the importance of calling for additional support when capacity is compromised.\n“They need to tend to the injured person, but at the same time, if your manpower is needed, you need to not only call 911, but also for backup,” Giarusso said.\nThe Sewerage and Water Board plans to implement redundancies and safeguards, including the capability to connect portable pumps to maintain pressure once a new power complex is completed in over a year.\nMorrell also called for improved communication, saying that a more effective response could have prevented misinformation about the water supply being jeopardized by a Mylar balloon.\n“Had the communication been in place, it would have given us more time to investigate and provide a timeline,” Morrell said. “For nearly 24 hours, the world thought our water supply could be knocked out by a Mylar balloon.”\nThe Sewerage and Water Board promises to issue advisory announcements promptly in future hazardous situations.\nCouncilman Oliver Thomas reported that the injured employee is still recovering at a local hospital.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

    "title": "How Chain IVF Clinics Improve Infertility Treatmen | Newswise",
    "text": "In the U.S., demand for in vitro fertilization (IVF) increased almost 140% between 2004 and 2018. Among other things, this trend suggests a business opportunity; in that same span of time the market share of for-profit chain clinics grew from 5% to 20%, with chains now performing over 40% of IVF treatment cycles nationwide. “Chain organizations are very common in hotels and restaurants,” says Ambar La Forgia , an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley. “But when it comes to healthcare, because it hasn’t traditionally been delivered in this way, it seems to be making a lot of people uneasy.” Policymakers are particularly concerned that chains will chase profit at the expense of patient outcomes. A new study by La Forgia, published in Management Science and coauthored by Julia Bodner of Copenhagen Business School, provides a more optimistic view in the case of fertility clinics, suggesting chain ownership has improved results. The researchers found that clinics acquired by a chain serve more patients, increasing IVF treatment cycles by 27%, and they increase live birth rates by nearly 14%. Significant improvement with chain clinics IVF treatment cycles comprise five main stages that require over 100 distinct steps performed over four to six weeks. Along the way, many subjective decisions must be made. The goal, of course, is to produce healthy babies, and the last step—when a physician transfers an embryo, or embryos, into a patient’s uterus—is particularly important. Transferring more than one embryo increases the success rate, which is measured by the number of live births divided by number of transfers, but it also increases the chance of multiple births, like twins, which is riskier for both the mother and the newborns. To compare the performance of chain and independent clinics, La Forgia and Bodner collated a novel set of clinic and patient data that drew from the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Center for Health Statistics. They also manually checked the ownership of every fertility clinic in the U.S. From this effort, they were able to look at two main outcomes between the years 2004 and 2018: How many IVF cycles does each clinic perform? And what is the success rate, measured by live births per transfer? The researchers found that after a fertility chain acquires a clinic, IVF cycles increase dramatically and live birth rates increase by 13.6%. “This means that these chain clinics are doing more cycles of IVF and converting more of those cycles into live births,” La Forgia says. “They are actually improving the quality of care in a meaningful way.” Chain clinics are not doing this by simply transferring a lot more embryos, either. La Forgia and Bodner find that they are actually producing more “singleton” births—that is, the birth of one baby—than their independent clinic peers, which implicitly suggests a better embryo selection process. A product of more resources and knowledge But what if these results are driven by a more stringent patient screening process, or by chains being more selective about the markets in which they operate? La Forgia and Bodner investigated these possibilities and found no supporting evidence. There is no appreciable change in the patient population after a chain takes over an independent clinic. In fact, the largest improvement in live births is among patients who are 38 years old and older—the population that typically has the lowest success rates. Nor are their significant differences in the broader demographics of neighborhoods in which chain clinics operate, the researchers found. Instead, it appears that chains improve outcomes through two mechanisms: the availability of more resources and a heavier focus on sharing best practices. The researchers make this case through several analyses. For instance, chains tend to introduce new processes and procedures known to improve birth rates. In fact, the lowest-performing clinics see the largest improvements when taken over by a chain, and clinics acquired by the highest-performing chains experience the greatest improvements. Most notably, the researchers found that affiliated IVF clinics, which pay chains for select management support and financing options but retain managerial independence, witness an increase in patient volume and number of IVF cycles, but unlike fully acquired clinics, they don’t demonstrate an improvement in birth rates. “Basically, in affiliated clinics the number of live births is going up as an absolute value, but they’re not getting better at achieving live births,” La Forgia says. “Our hypothesis is that a chain is willing to share its resources widely, but it may not want to share specific knowledge with an organization it doesn’t own, so we’ll only see this knowledge transfer in acquired clinics.” The authors demonstrated a final benefit of chains, which is that they increase access to IVF by expanding the market—performing more IVF cycles—rather than stealing business from competitors. Supporting a better healthcare market Some of the findings may be explained by the fact that compared with many other parts of the healthcare system, fertility clinics share some characteristics with retail stores and chain restaurants. It’s a relatively more competitive market and patients typically pay up front and out-of-pocket for care. Clinics are also legally required to send their data to the government. Other sectors like dialysis and nursing care are more opaque and dependent on insurance, so chains may have fewer incentives to improve quality of care. But the researchers point out that plenty of health care is shifting toward a retail model, including dermatology providers, urgent care clinics, and physical therapists. The authors offer three recommendations to help these markets support the kind of competition that ultimately improves patient outcomes. - Policymakers should increase transparency about quality of care. In the fertility sector, clinics are legally required to send their data to the government, which publishes them as an online report card , so patients can shop around. - Price transparency is necessary to increase competition among providers. In most healthcare settings, patients do not know how much they will pay, often until months after treatment. Since patients typically pay up front for fertility treatments, clinic chains may compete more on prices to attract new patients. - Finally, regulators should make sure patients have sufficient choice. In the dialysis market, for instance, two companies own 60% of clinics. Such concentration of power may negatively affect both prices and quality. As chains expand, regulators should make sure this growth doesn’t hinder patient choice. “Very little research speaks to the ways in which chains are good or bad for patients,” La Forgia says. “We ought to start paying attention to what kinds of markets might lend themselves well to this business model.” Read the full paper: Getting Down to Business: Chain Ownership and Fertility Clinic Performance By Ambar La Forgia and Julia Bodner Management Science September 2024 Related content: Fertility Clinics Show How the Chain Model Can Improve Healthcare By Ambar La Forgia Harvard Business Review, October 15, 2024 MEDIA CONTACT [Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)",

Around 90 percent of the country's territory was covered in snow up to 100 centimeters thick, leading to the death of approximately 8 million livestock.\n\"Dzud\" is a Mongolian term describing a severe winter during which large numbers of livestock perish due to frozen or snow-covered grazing lands. ■",
