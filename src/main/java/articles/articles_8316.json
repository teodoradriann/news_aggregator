    "title": "PNUD : la transition énergétique verte de la Chine aide et inspire les pays du monde entier (INTERVIEW) - Xinhua - french.news.cn",
    "text": "par Martina Fuchs\nDUBAI, 15 février (Xinhua) -- Le chef du Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD) a salué les efforts de la Chine pour contribuer à la réponse mondiale au changement climatique et son rôle dans la stratégie de transition verte, tout en soulignant que la Chine était l'épine dorsale de la reprise économique internationale.\nInterrogé sur ses perspectives pour l'économie mondiale et chinoise cette année, l'administrateur du PNUD, Achim Steiner, a déclaré récemment à Xinhua dans une interview lors du 11e Sommet mondial des gouvernements du 12 au 14 février à Dubaï : \" Les perspectives de l'économie mondiale reposent également en partie sur le développement économique de la Chine\".\n\"La reprise de la Chine en termes de croissance du PIB semble actuellement positive. Mais de nombreux facteurs influencent cette situation, notamment les perturbations des chaînes d'approvisionnement mondiales, des perturbations commerciales et géopolitiques\", a-t-il ajouté.\nSon évaluation intervient alors que le Fonds monétaire international (FMI) a relevé ses prévisions de croissance mondiale à 3,1% en 2024 et à 3,2 % en 2025.\n\"Les perspectives restent celles où la Chine reste un pilier majeur de la reprise économique internationale. Mais voyons où nous mènent nos voies de développement mondial. Nous restons très optimistes quant au fait qu'une reprise est en cours\", a souligné M. Steiner.\nLe PNUD travaille dans environ 170 pays et territoires, contribuant à éradiquer la pauvreté, à réduire les inégalités et l'exclusion et à renforcer la résilience afin que les pays puissent poursuivre leurs progrès. En tant qu'agence de développement des Nations Unies, le PNUD joue un rôle essentiel en aidant les pays à atteindre les Objectifs de développement durable (ODD).\nERADICATION DE LA PAUVRETE EN CHINE\nEn 2021, la Chine est parvenue à éradiquer la pauvreté absolue dans le pays, sortant plus de 770 millions d'habitants ruraux de la pauvreté depuis le début de la réforme et de l'ouverture à la fin des années 1970.\nM. Steiner a commenté : \" Le développement de la Chine a été remarquable à bien des égards en termes de réduction de la pauvreté, mais aussi d'investissements dans la technologie et la transition verte. Il s'attaque à certains des héritages de son industrialisation rapide, à la pollution de l'air, mais aussi à l'assainissement d'eau\".\nLa décarbonation de l'approvisionnement énergétique reste une grande priorité et la Chine a pris des engagements majeurs, à la fois sur le pic d'utilisation des combustibles fossiles et sur l'utilisation du charbon, pour atteindre un objectif de zéro émission d'ici 2060, a-t-il déclaré.\n\"Ces transitions permettront à la Chine de contribuer à la réponse mondiale au changement climatique, mais aussi, grâce à ses technologies et à ses politiques, d'aider de nombreux autres pays, y compris de nombreux pays en développement, à s'orienter vers une stratégie de transition verte\", a-t-il souligné.\n\"Nous voyons un grand potentiel pour notre future collaboration avec la Chine sur les ODD, notamment dans les pôles d'innovation des ODD que la Chine est en train d'établir\", a conclu M. Steiner. Fin\nVous avez une question, une remarque, des suggestions ? Contactez notre équipe de rédaction par e-mail à xinhuanet_french@news.cn",

    "title": "DOOM The Dark Ages Release Date Unveiled, Will Feature New Mecha Mechanic",
    "text": "During the Xbox Developer Direct January 2025 live stream, Bethesda and id Software announced that DOOM The Dark Ages will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Game Pass and PC on 15 May 2025.\nIn the presentation, the developer reveals that DOOM The Dark Ages will feature a new mecha mechanic (where players will be able to control a giant mech for combat). There will also be more difficulty options and modifiers.\nThe action in DOOM: The Dark Ages is a grounded experience focused on the sheer power that the Slayer wields – devastating melee abilities, and the return of strafing, a classic DOOM manoeuvre. The team puts it best: In DOOM Eternal, you felt like a fighter jet, but in DOOM: The Dark Ages you’ll be an iron tank, ready to stand and fight. A loadout of new melee weapons, plus a brand-new melee skill tree means you’ll be able to get up close and personal to your demons and deliver some serious damage.\nDuring the show, we were introduced to the Shield Saw, packed with features to both block incoming fire, decapitate foes from afar, or traverse the environment. The segment also showed us a huge, spiked flail, an electric gauntlet built to pummel and paralyze incoming foes, and a fierce spiked mace; three new weapons that all come with their own combos and upgrade options.\nIt’s all about engagement; creating a loop or “dance” that’s intuitive, innovative and loaded with depth – fun on the outside smart on the inside,” Game Director Hugo Martin says. “An appealing power fantasy that’s new but familiar – who hasn’t wanted to feel like an iron tank in the middle of a medieval war against hell?”\nObviously, DOOM is also all about the guns, and that trademark top-shelf shooting is here in abundance too. We saw a handful of the ranged weapons in action – a hulking double-barrel shotgun packing a punch, a mean, energy-powered gun spewing paralysing shots, and, perhaps the most impressive – a preposterous-looking machine gun that fashions high-speed rounds by breaking down actual skulls. It’s an utterly menacing arsenal built to take on the biggest and baddest demons you’ve ever faced in a DOOM game.\nBigger demons means bigger battles, and mech fans, rejoice – you’re in for an absolute treat. In DOOM: The Dark Ages, you’ll be able to pilot your own gigantic Atlan, a mech of gargantuan proportion built to take on baddies on a colossal scale. One clip in the segment looks like a kaiju movie, showing the Atlan throwing annihilating hits at a demon the size of a building – it’s Doom’s epic, brutal combat moments on a literally next level scale.\nIf that wasn’t enough, the team has also leaned more into the fantasy flair with another new weapon – a giant cybernetic dragon complete with mounted gatling guns, able to swoop in from above and absolutely drill through anything standing in its way – letting you hop on and take the fight to the skies. While DOOM: The Dark Ages internal motto has been ‘Stand and Fight,’ this piece of equipment lets us mix it up with some fantasy style airborne combat, which looks extremely fun, Both the dragon and the Atlan come with their own suite of upgrades too, so as you use them, they’ll actually get even more impressive and effective than they already are.\nDOOM The Dark Ages is the prequel to the critically acclaimed DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal and the third instalment of the modern DOOM series. Developed by id Software on the latest idTech engine, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a single-player action FPS that tells the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage.\nYou are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell.\nCheck out the trailers below:",

    "text": "Study: Vaping can increase chances of heart failure\nThe Great American Smokeout was held on Thursday, Nov. 21.\nThe initiative is held every year to encourage people to quit smoking.\nHowever, it’s not just smoking that’s a concern, so is vaping.\nA [recent study](https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2024/04/01/21/51/study-links-e-cigarette-use-with-higher-risk-of-heart-failure) shows those who vape are 19% more likely to develop heart failure than those who have never done it before.\n“The study was looking at, with this new trend of vaping, does it actually affect the heart in such a way that it causes the heart to fail? Heart failure is extremely dangerous of a condition and very prominent. So anytime that we can look for causes that are reversible, we want to look for them,” said Dr. Nina Thakkar Rivera, a heart failure and transplant cardiologist for Cleveland Clinic.\nDr. Rivera was not affiliated with the study.\nHowever, she explained that heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of your body. So how does vaping put you at risk for that?\nShe said it has to do with the toxic chemicals used in vaping devices.\nThey can impact the heart in many ways. The effects are similar to nicotine, which can increase blood pressure and heart rate and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle.\nDr. Rivera said with the growing evidence showing the dangers of vaping, she strongly recommends quitting.\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, you should tell your physician.\n“Any type of cough, or shortness of breath, any chest pain, palpitations, any of these cardiac symptoms should alert immediate attention from the medical field,” she advised.\nIf you are having trouble quitting on your own, there are free resources available online, within the community, as well as from your primary physician.",

    "text": "The glitch has been affecting multiple iOS versions iPhone alarm glitch causing all sorts of problems: Check solution By Akash Pandey Jan 10, 2025 12:48 pm What's the story\nA long-standing problem with iPhone alarms is causing a lot of trouble for users. The glitch, which causes alarms to not ring at all or ring late, has been around for a long time, affecting multiple iOS versions. Recent Reddit posts have intensified discussions on the issue and potential solutions. Even as Apple has been trying to fix the issue, it continues to haunt users and mess up their daily lives.Real-world consequencesThe alarm glitch has caught a lot of attention as people are taking to social media platforms to share their experiences. One user, bryanlolwut , on the r/iphone subreddit has highlighted the difference between his iPhone and Apple Watch alarm times with a photo. His alarm was set for 10:30am but didn't go off until 12:42pm. Another Redditor mentioned reminders set for 10:30 and 10:45 (am/pm unspecified) went off randomly after 11. This means the issue is not only disrupting alarms.Severe implicationsThe alarm glitch on iPhones isn't just a minor inconvenience but has serious real-world implications. One Reddit user shared how they nearly lost their job due to their alarm failing to wake them up. Another user resorted to using a backup alarm clock after almost missing an important exam because of this issue. These incidents underscore the severity of the problem and its impact on users' lives.Long-standing issueContrary to what some users believe, that the alarm glitch is associated with recent iOS updates, complaints about the issue date back as far as 2009. Meaning, the problem is not new and has existed across multiple versions of Apple's OS. Even though Apple has recommended disabling the \"Attention-Aware Features\" (dimming display, lowering alert volumes when it detects your face), many have found it ineffective. Still try navigating to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off \"Attention-Aware Features.\"Temporary solutionsUntil Apple issues a permanent fix, users can take a few steps to reduce the risk of missed alarms and reminders. These include disabling \"Attention Aware\" features, using backup alarms on other devices or old-school alarm clocks, double-checking alarms and reminders settings, keeping software updated, regularly restarting their device, and reporting the issue to Apple.",

STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ The 1964 Greenfield cross country championship team’s coach Pete Conway. STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ The 1964 Greenfield state cross country championship team coach Peter Conway and his team at their 60th anniversary celebration at Terrazza on Thursday. STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ GREENFIELD — State championship teams tend to be tight-knit groups that compete for one another. That mentality defined the 1964 Greenfield cross country team. That 1964 team — which consisted of Dave Ciszewski, Dennis Bates, Jon Thompson, John Kaczenski, George Platek, Mike Belleau, Steve Kelleher, Ed Haseltine, Verne Sunde and Dennis Tetreault and was coached by Pete Conway — had plenty of talented runners who wanted to compete for one another. That led to an undefeated season and culminated in a state championship, the first state championship ever achieved by a Greenfield High School team. Now 60 years later, that team got together on Thursday at Terrazza in Greenfield to celebrate their accomplishments. With seven runners from that team — Ciszewski, Kaczenski, Belleau, Platek, Kelleher, Thompson and Sunde — as well as Conway being there for the reunion, coming from all over to be there, it shows just how close that group was. “It was so much fun,” Conway said. “It was great to have so many of them there. Some had to travel some way to get there while some were lucky to still be nearby. I’m 90 now and they’re in their 70s. I’m glad it happened and that we were all able to enjoy it.” The reunion saw stories and memories swapped and greetings from those who haven’t seen each other in a long time. Many former Greenfield cross country and track greats were also in attendance. For Conway, the ’64 team was a special one simply because it was the first team he had ever coached. After trying to start a cross country team at Turners Falls, Conway was offered a job at Greenfield and accepted, starting the cross country program while also teaching at the school. It didn’t take him long to realize what a talented group of runners he had to work with. “I knew they were a state championship caliber group,” Conway said. “The team had so much talent. I could sense it early because I had just finished running at UMass and had been competing in road races. As soon as we started they were doing workouts that I would do as a college runner. Within a week I knew I had something special.” When the first-year coach saw the potential, he made sure to work them. Going back to when he would run at Springfield College, Conway had seen the motto of the Springfield team was the triangle: mind, body and spirit. Conway talked to the team about how the mind can control the body, but that spirit isn’t just laughing and having a good time, it’s about encompassing your emotions and pushing forward even when your body and mind are telling you to stop. “I incorporated everything I believed in and taught that to the team,” Conway said. “If you are good at something and want to share it, that’s what you should do. That was my first year so I really tried to pass that message down to them so not only would they take that into cross country, but they would take those values and messages into their lives forever. “Seeing them today brought back a lot of memories,” Conway said. “They know how hard I used to push them. You don’t become a champion without being pushed. You don’t become a champion by just singing songs while running down the road.” The ’64 Green Wave team would run 10, 11 or 12 miles every week, sticking to Conway’s workouts which he would document in a book (one he brought with him on Thursday to the reunion), which he made extra hard to get the most out of his runners. The results showed, as Greenfield didn’t come close to losing a meet all season, including a decisive win in the state championship meet. “The runners on that team never got beat by anybody,” Conway said. “We would have 10 guys running and all 10 would finish before the first person on the other team would. Every meet the score would be 15-50 us. We won the Valley League and went unbeaten.” As a first-year coach, Conway learned on the job. Having a group of dedicated runners made his life much easier. “I was learning how to observe, incorporate and change things on the fly,” Conway said. “I would change the workouts for each kid to get the most out of them.” Conway credits the attitude and how well the team listened for their success. “They had an attitude that they would be the best,” Conway said. “That makes it easy for me. We were a close-knit group. We ran so well because we were all together.They all knew they had a job to do and they had to take it on their own to accomplish it. It was never just about doing your best. If I posted a workout, they were going to accomplish it. They ran hard for me.” Conway, who still coaches track at Greenfield, credits his late wife, Patti, for helping with the team and keeping him focused in his first year coaching. “I couldn’t have done it without her,” Conway said. “I had to stop and collect myself [Thursday] when I told them how much her support meant to me and the team. It wouldn’t have been possible without her.” Conway also credited Sunde for coming up with the idea of the reunion and planning it. “All the credit goes to Verne Sunde for today,” Conway said. “Verne talked about a reunion months ago. He contacted the ’64 team and they all wanted to come if they could. The plans developed from there. He was the spark plug behind it. I can’t take any credit for it. “It felt necessary to recognize people were 60 years ago were part of a state championship winning team. I’m glad we did it.” SOUTH DEERFIELD — Tree House Brewing Co. has been given the go-ahead to more than triple its occupancy for the upcoming season, pending public...

    "title": "Cambodia 'upcycler' turns tons of plastic bottles into brooms - VnExpress International",
    "text": "For the past 11 months they have transformed around 40 tonnes of discarded plastic bottles, about 5,000 bottles per day, by \"upcycling\" them into brooms they say are more robust than regular brushes. Those sell for 10,000 riel ($2.50) and 15,000 riel ($3.75) each. Plastic strips from the empty bottles are collected into a bundle on a machine, before being softened in hot water and sliced evenly to be sewn with metal wires into the ends of a bamboo stick. Cambodian entrepreneur Has Kea, 41, wants to reduce plastic pollution in his community, in a city that produces up to 38,000 tons of all types of waste each day, according to its environmental department. About a fifth of that is single-use plastic that ends up in landfills and waterways. \"This broom is quite solid, not easy to break,\" said Suon Kosal, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk whose temple bought 80 of the brooms last month. Kea buys empty plastic bottles from trash collectors and garbage depots. With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business. He is also open to competitors stepping in to the market. \"This also help reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn, could earn them a better living,\" he said.",
