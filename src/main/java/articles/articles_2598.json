    "text": "120 losses ties 1962 New York Mets for most in a season after the year 1900 CHICAGO (WLS) -- The Chicago White Sox played their final home game of the season Thursday at Guaranteed Rate Field. After sweeping the Los Angeles Angels, the team remains tied with the 1962 expansion New York Mets at 120 losses on the season, making the 2024 Sox one of the worst baseball teams in modern history. It's been a tough season to be a Sox fan, which is why some fans who went to the game Thursday are trying to remain anonymous. However, on the last home game of the season on a beautiful fall afternoon, there was still a crowd rushing in as soon as the gates opened. \"It's always fun to be at the ballpark, no matter who it is our what's going on,\" fan Danny Garcia said. Many fans said they were hoping to see history. With one more loss, the Sox will set the post-1900 single-season record for losses, a record that has stood for 62 years. \"As a baseball fan, you just wanna see history, even if it's the wrong side of history,\" fan Dan Lewis said. Some fans are trying to have fun with it. \"We'd like to see the record honestly. Why not?\" fan Ann Marie Daker said. \"It's still a record. It's fun.\" While crowds have been sparse all season, the potential record setting loss seems to have brought more fans out the last few games. \"Everyone wants to say they're here, plus it doesn't hurt with $10 tickets, $10 parking and $5 beer,\" fan James Connelly said. There are still plenty of die-hard fans hoping to avoid history. They hoped for a win. Janet Hoshaw has been rooting for the White Sox for 88 years. \"I'm not gonna sit here and hope the Sox lose,\" Hoshaw said. \"I can't do it.\" After scoring seven runs in the fifth inning, the Sox managed to avoid the record for another day. It was a small consolation for fans. \"I hope they do better next year,\" fan Diane Maltase said.",

    "text": "Environment\nSLO County’s Bob Jones Trail holds on by $7.8 million thread after another funding hurdle\nSan Luis Obispo County hit another roadblock in its effort to finish the Bob Jones Trail — but yet another burst of funding just might save the project.\nThe San Luis Obispo Council of Governments Board of Directors voted 9-0 on Wednesday morning to allocate another $7.8 million to the path that will link the city of SLO to the sea in Avila Beach.\nSupervisor John Peschong abstained due to an ongoing conflict of interest.\nThe now-$48-million project will bridge a 4.5-mile gap in the trail — a price tag that has more than doubled since its original estimate in 2021.\nCaltrans District 5 originally pledged $6 million to the new trail design, but the agency withdrew that funding in February upon learning that the project wasn’t eligible for it.\nOn Wednesday, the San Luis Obispo Council of Government stepped in at the eleventh hour with the $7.8 million to close the project’s funding gap, adding to the $7.7 million the council has already committed.\nThe California Transportation Commission will review the project for final approval at its March 20 meeting.\nBob Jones Trail connection to be built in phases\nThe completion of the Bob Jones Trail has been held up for years by five property owners whose land the trail passes through, but local rancher Ray Bunnell in particular has been at the center of the county’s attention.\nThe county tried — and failed — to secure a corner of Bunnell’s land for years, at one point offering him more than $200,000 for just over an acre of his 146-acre property, but the rancher turned down the deal and has stood firm on his hard-fast rejection of putting the trail on his property.\nThe county then regrouped and pursued a “bookend approach,” designing the trail to avoid the withholding properties — including Bunnell’s — while working with Caltrans to complete the missing portion.\nThe new trail will reroute onto a strip of Caltrans-owned land next to Highway 101 for a stretch between Clover Ridge Lane and Ontario Road, county civil engineer John Waddell previously told The Tribune.\nCaltrans originally committed $6 million to funding and constructing the path on that land, but that plan fell through due to “miscommunications with headquarters,” SLO Council of Governments programming director Rich Murphy said at Tuesday’s meeting.\nThe bookends on either end of the Caltrans corridor will be built in two phases.\nPhase one will complete the northern bookend from the Octagon Barn to Clover Ridge Lane using funds from an $18 million grant from the Active Transportation Commission secured by the county in 2021. Originally, the grant was meant to cover the entire cost of the project.\nConstruction must begin this year in order to keep the grant funds from expiring.\nConstruction on phase two, which will finish the southern bookend from the Caltrans right-of-way to the Ontario Road staging area, will start in 2027-28.\nIt will be paid for by the original $9.6 million in contributions from the SLO County Council of Government and the county’s recent $5 million contribution.\nThe Friends of the Bob Jones Trail also raised $270,000 in private funds for the project.\nTo keep trail users safe along the highway segment, Caltrans will likely install a protective barrier between the highway and the path, which would be built 10 to 12 feet away from the roadway, Waddell said.\nThe project gets a new funding plan\nBecause the new design was relocated onto a strip of Caltrans-owned property, Caltrans District 5 committed to securing $6 million in State Highway Operations and Protection Program funding for construction of the trail on that land.\nBut on Feb. 14, “Caltrans Headquarters informed District 5 that the project ultimately does not meet the eligibility requirements” for the funding, the staff report said.\nCaltrans’ estimate for the cost of building along their right of way also increased by $1.8 million, SLO County public works spokesperson Shelly Cone told The Tribune.\nThat left the project with a $7.8 million funding gap, and the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments with three options.\nFirst, the council of governments could choose to advance $7.8 million from its 2026 fund cycle to fully fund the Bob Jones Trail and retain the $18.5 million Active Transportation grant, while attempting to recoup some funds through future negotiations with Caltrans.\nThe second option would’ve been to return the $18 million state grant and construct as much of the trail as possible using the $12.7 million in combined commitments from the county and the council of governments. Without total funding, this option likely would have resulted in the second phase of construction being significantly delayed, pushing costs even higher.\nFinally, all funding could have been returned — including all contributions from the county, the council of governments and the state — and the county could have been asked to apply for a new state grant to pay for the entire project in a future funding cycle.\n“All the options really aren’t that great,” Murphy said on Tuesday.\nUltimately, the council of governments unanimously chose to reappropriate the $7.8 million from their future budget, bringing its total contributions to the Bob Jones Trail project to $15 million.\n“We’re in a position to advance 2026 funding capacity, and we’re in a position to retain the state grant, and we’re in a position to still leverage prior commitment of resources from the county and (the council),” Murphy said.\nWith the additional $7.8 million from the council, the project is once again slated for approval by the California Transportation Commission at the end of the month.",

    "text": "5 Mental Health Misconceptions in the Church - [Beth Ann Baus](https://www.crosswalk.com/author/beth-ann-baus/)Crosswalk.com Contributor - Updated May 30, 2024 When I hear about misconceptions within the church regarding mental health issues, I can’t help but think there’s some misunderstanding, miscommunication, and misapplication of Scripture. I also can’t help but think that two Christians can disagree on the fundamentals of topics, such as mental health issues, with bits of truth in each of their thoughts on the topic. While we all like absolute truth and want to be the ones who hold that truth, we need to consider that two things can be true at the same time. Varying views on the topic of mental health are perfect examples of this. We should all strive to enter into mental health conversations with an open mind and a willingness to hear those who think differently. While this is not an exhaustive list, I offer you five misconceptions we tend to find in the church surrounding conversations about mental health. I offer my thoughts based on my experience as a biblical counselor, not a medical professional. I pray the following thoughts will help guide you in future conversations surrounding this very important topic. Photo Credit: ChatGPT/Image created using DALL.E 2024 AI technology - 1. Misconception: The Church Doesn’t Understand Mental HealthSlide 1 of 5 Discussions on mental health can get tricky because this terminology covers such a wide range of issues. After a long, stressful day at work, a long night with sick, restless children, or a long week cramming for exams, someone might say their mental health is suffering. Someone else might reserve the talk of mental health for someone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, OCD, or bipolar disorder. In other words, when broaching this subject, it’s helpful to define our terms and understand that there is a spectrum of mental health conditions. It’s also helpful to give grace to those who lack understanding or education on this subject. We shouldn’t expect everyone to understand or empathize in the way we want them to because everyone enters the conversation on mental health with their own definitions, experiences, and preconceived notions. If you open up to someone in your church about your mental health and their response is less than desirable, don’t respond by cutting this person off. Don’t respond by never talking to anyone else about your struggles. Don’t allow yourself to deem the church as an unsafe place for mental health issues. Instead, take the time to explain, educate, and even lovingly challenge the feedback you received. Do this with love, respect, and humility. Do this while reminding yourself that because we don’t have complete knowledge, there might be some nuggets of truth and helpful application in the response you didn’t like. Remember, mental anguish is on full display in the Psalms. The Bible and the church understand mental health more than you might think. Photo credit: ©Nagesh Badu/Unsplash - 2. Misconception: Your Mental Health Issues Are Your FaultSlide 2 of 5 A common response people get to a mental health crisis is the “just do more” mindset. Just pray more. Just read your Bible more. Just read this book on depression. Just spend more time with fellow Christians. You get the idea. Just do more. Though based on good intentions, this mindset implies that the sufferer is doing something wrong. And if the sufferer would just do these other “right” things, all would be well. As Christians, we should find help and comfort in the Lord. So, when someone sends a sufferer to the Lord, they are offering the absolute best solution they know to offer. I hope sufferers in this situation can find some semblance of appreciation in the gesture and try to let go of the unintentional implications. In the spirit of [Romans 12:18](https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/12-18.html), “If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all,” do your best to assume that the person pointing you to “do more” is doing so with good intentions. You may be talking to someone who lands on the opposite end of the mental health spectrum, and they are pointing you to what worked for them. The reality, which many don’t understand, is that those who suffer from mental illness often struggle to feel the joy of the Lord as others do. They often feel neglected or ignored by God after crying out to Him yet finding no immediate relief from their suffering. [Faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/)is a gift given by God ( [Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/passage/?q=ephesians+2:8-9)). We know this is true, yet it remains a mystery. The same can be said about the mystery of a Christian who struggles with mental illness and rarely, if ever, feels the fullness of the [Holy Spirit](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/10-supernatural-ways-the-holy-spirit-wants-to-empower-you.html). This isn’t a problem to be fixed by simply doing more. Photo Credit: ©iStock/Getty Images Plus/Mindful Media - 3. Misconception: Your Faith Must Be WeakSlide 3 of 5 Our mental and spiritual health often overlap, and it’s okay to admit that our spiritual and mental health have a mutual impact on one another. However, making the blanket statement that mental health issues are a sign of weak [faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/)is irresponsible, hurtful, and wrong. Consider someone who has slipped into depression after the loss of a loved one. Could there be a spiritual component to how they respond to their grief? Yes, there could be. But it’s also true that they are experiencing normal sadness. The emotional, physical, and mental toll brought on by grief is to be expected and does not have to be an indicator that their faith is suffering. The reality is that ALL professing Christians have areas of weakness in their faith. We see a father humbly exclaim this truth in [Mark 9:24](https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/9-24.html). It’s okay to remind someone of this if they point to your faith as the cause of your mental health struggles. It’s okay to acknowledge that leaning on the Lord more might help you live with the mental health struggles you have while also acknowledging that the source of your mental health struggle is something else entirely. If you share about your mental health struggles and the response you get is to blame weak faith, it’s likely the person you’re talking to has never experienced a mental health struggle. Remind yourself of this before you deem them toxic and unsafe. And honestly, be thankful, for their sake, that they don’t fully understand what they’re talking about.

Misconception: You Should Just Trust God MoreSlide 4 of 5 I was diagnosed with OCD in my early twenties. As a Christian, I’ve grown to see the connection between my trust issues, including a lack of trust in God, and some aspects of my OCD tendencies. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest to make those connections because more than one thing can be true. Do I think the onset of my OCD was a result of not trusting God? No. But I can see ways my lack of [faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/), trust, and reliance on God have impacted my tendencies and have played a part in my struggle with OCD. Can I trust God more? Absolutely. Can every professing Christian trust God more? Absolutely. Does a wavering trust in God have to be the foundation of my diagnosis? No. Consider a woman who experiences PTSD after being assaulted. She understandably has trust issues and may have what appears to the average person to be irrational fears. Might leaning on the Lord more and learning to trust Him help this woman in her healing process? Yes, I would say so. Does this woman experience PTSD, trust issues, and irrational fears because she wasn’t trusting in the Lord at the moment of her assault? No. She’s responding to being threatened and violated. I don’t think the average person would conclude that had she had unwavering trust in God at the time of her assault, she would not currently be living in fear. Yet it’s logical to conclude that deepening her reliance on the Lord now would help in her healing process. I would argue that one way the Lord redeems the horrific things that happen to us is by drawing us to Himself and allowing us to deepen our dependence on Him ( [Psalm 34:18](https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/34-18.html)).Photo Credit: ©iStock/Getty Images Plus/PixelCatchers - 5. Misconception: Taking Medication Is WrongSlide 5 of 5 I’ve heard some churchgoers push back against taking medication for mental health issues by saying that [Jesus](https://www.crosswalk.com/who-is-jesus.html)is enough. He’s all you need. And that’s true. His grace is sufficient ( [2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/12-9.html)). He is our only hope in life and death. And yet, the Bible doesn’t command or condemn medical intervention when it comes to our physical or mental health. In other words, taking medication is a wisdom issue, not a sin issue. Taking medication, for some, is a must in order to function in this life. And if that’s you, then take your medication without hesitancy and without guilt or fear of judgment. For others, though, medication is used to dull an emotion, such as grief. Medication might be necessary or helpful for a season, but the grief will still be waiting to be dealt with once the medication stops. This is why medication is a wisdom issue, not a sin issue. For some, medication is necessary, and for others, it is not. It is up to each individual to assess their mental health, with the guidance of their medical physician, and to decide if medication is right for them. Each individual must weigh the risks and benefits and decide if deeper issues need to be addressed and, if so, when and how. We must remember that Jesus isn’t a pill, and your pills aren’t your Savior. Jesus is needed by all; medication is needed by some. And remember, taking medication can actually be a [faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/)-building exercise. Consider Hezekiah in [Isaiah 38](https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/38.html). He cried out to the Lord in his medical distress. The Lord graciously extended his days and offered healing through a fig cake. Hezekiah applied the fig cake to his physical sores, all the while depending on the Lord for healing to take place. Conversations about mental health are important, and we need to keep having them even when it’s hard and hurtful. We must hear those who disagree with our point of view just as we want them to hear us. It’s also important to flesh out our thoughts on this topic because sometimes we are unintentionally caught up in misunderstandings, miscommunications, and misapplication of Scripture. It’s important to remember that when someone points you to Christ, it’s because that’s the only place they know to point you. I hesitate to think that a fellow Christian would intentionally dismiss your struggles or condemn how you’re dealing with them without just cause. They are likely speaking from a heart of inadequacy and are making a beeline for the rock and refuge we are so blessed to have. Mental health is an area we will all continue to learn about and grow in our understanding. Information changes, and with it, our thoughts and understanding. But one thing we can all agree on is that the Lord cares about your mental health. He sees your distress and hears your cries. He is the author and perfecter of your faith; He will carry you through.

    "title": "Hamas says it accepts cease-fire proposal from Egypt, Qatar",
    "text": "Jordan's King Abdullah II warned that an Israeli assault on Rafah could 'lead to a new massacre' in the 7-month conflict. Hamas said Monday that it had accepted a Gaza cease-fire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, but Israel reacted coolly to the announcement and said its planned assault on the southern city of Rafah would proceed. The militant group said its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief of its acceptance of their proposal. The announcement came hours after Palestinians were warned to evacuate parts of Rafah as Israel prepared for an attack certain to worsen an acute humanitarian crisis . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the new proposal was \"far from Israel's requirements.\" Israel said the Rafah assault would go ahead − despite clear U.S. disapproval. State Department spokesman Matt Miller said the Biden administration was reviewing the Hamas announcement and \"will be discussing this response with our partners over the coming hours.” Israel attacks Rafah: Hamas claims responsibility for deadly rocket strike Earlier Monday, an Israeli official told Reuters the deal approved by Hamas appeared to be a softened version of an Egyptian proposal that included “far-reaching” conclusions that Israel could not accept. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Hamas announcement could be a ruse to make Israel appear intransigent. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir described the announcement as a \"trick.\" “Hamas' exercises and games have only one answer: An immediate order to occupy Rafah!\" Ben-Gvir wrote on social media. \"Increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete defeat of Hamas.” Israel began its assault on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led rampage on Oct. 7, when almost 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies. More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and more than 77,000 have been wounded, according to Gaza's health ministry. A cease-fire that took place late last year resulted in the release of about 100 hostages. Developments: ∎ Hamas said it had accepted a new cease-fire proposal put forward by Qatar and Egypt. ∎ Israel was cool to the new proposal and said its invasion of Rafah would proceed. ∎ Palestinian evacuees in Rafah were warned not to migrate toward the Egyptian or Israel borders. The announcements came one day after four Israeli soldiers were killed in a Hamas rocket attack just outside the city. [Jordan's king says Rafah invasion could 'lead to a new massacre'] Jordan's King Abdullah II warned that an Israeli assault on Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge, \"threatens to lead to a new massacre,\" according to a statement posted on social media by the Royal Hashemite Court. Abdullah met on Monday with President Joe Biden, where the two leaders affirmed their \"commitment to working to reach a sustainable ceasefire\" in Gaza, the royal court said. Jordan is a key U.S. ally in the region. Last month, the Jordanian air force shot down dozens of Iranian drones headed for Israel as Tehran launched a massive revenge attack on its arch-enemy. The White House wasn't as publicly explicit in its concerns over the potential civilian toll of a Rafah operation. Earlier this year, Biden said it would be \"catastrophic.\" On Monday the White House would only say: \"The President reiterated his clear position on Rafah\" during a phone call with Netanyahu. “Israel's order for around 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza to evacuate ahead of an offensive in Rafah puts every single Palestinian in Gaza in grave danger,\" the humanitarian group Oxfam said in a statement . −Dan Morrison [Israel skeptical of new cease-fire proposal, full speed ahead on Rafah invasion] A statement from Netanyahu's office released mid-afternoon in Washington dampened hopes for a pause in the seven-month conflict. \"Israel's war cabinet has unanimously decided that Israel will continue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas to advance the release of our hostages, destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future,\" the statement read. \"Meanwhile, even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's requirements, Israel will send a delegation to mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel.\" −Joey Garrison [Israeli evacuation announcement sends Palestinians into streets] About 100,000 Palestinians are believed to live in the evacuation area of Rafah. The Israeli military instructed residents to evacuate ahead of a \"limited scope\" operation. Rafah, a city of about 275,000 before the war, has been overwhelmed by up to a million additional residents who fled fighting elsewhere in the embattled enclave. The Israeli military called on residents in the eastern neighborhoods of Rafah to \"temporarily evacuate to the expanded humanitarian area\" a few miles outside the city. The warnings were issued through text messages, phone calls and Arabic media broadcasts. Thousands of residents heeding the call were crowding streets with cars, pickups and mule-drawn carts, urged on by blasts heard across eastern parts of the city. The White House issued a statement saying the administration made its opposition to a ground invasion of Rafah clear to the Israeli government. \"We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering,\" the statement said. \"Those talks are ongoing now.\" President Joe Biden and Netanyahu later spoke by phone, marking Holocaust Remembrance Day and discussing talks aimed at the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The readout's only mention of Rafah was that \"the president reiterated his clear position on Rafah.\" [US criticized for supporting Israeli military] Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Israel's allies have failed to restrain \"indiscriminate attacks\" in Gaza for months and now have failed to prevent the war from spreading to a city that become \"one of the largest displacement camps in the world.\" Those allies, which include the U.S., provided Israel with arms and thus share the responsibility, he said. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the evacuation order as a \"dangerous escalation\" that would have consequences. \"The U.S. administration, alongside the occupation, bears responsibility for this terrorism,\" he said. [Former Israeli intel official chastises West for criticisms] Former Israeli Intelligence official and regional analyst Avi Melamed said the evacuation orders are likely the first phase in a \"slow and deliberate\" Israeli assault on the city. In an email to USA TODAY, Melamed said Israel understands the \"diplomatic challenges\" and suggested the tempo of its operations will differ from the rapid attacks elsewhere in Gaza. Israeli leaders hope the Rafah operation helps dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure and capabilities while also increasing the pressure on Hamas leaders to sign a deal, Melamed said. He chastised the West for criticizing Israel's military operations and said Hamas must be held accountable for its actions to encourage participation in a peace process. \"The diplomatic outcry by Western leaders in response to the evacuation orders illustrates why Hamas continues its firm opposition to meaningful compromise,\" Melamed said. Hamas \"knew and expected that any Israeli move toward Rafah would be met with public outcry.\" [Columbia University cancels graduation ceremony] Columbia University , the epicenter for campus protests opposing Israel's war in Gaza, announced Monday that it will not hold its main commencement ceremony following weeks of protests . In a news release , the university said it chose to make \"school-level ceremonies\" and other smaller celebrations the centerpiece of this year's graduation instead of a \"large, formal ceremony\" originally scheduled for May 15. \"We will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly,\" the university said, adding that a \"festive event\" may still take place next week. Monday's announcement came as universities continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protests on campus. At Columbia, the New York Police Department made 112 arrests Tuesday while dismantling an encampment and ushering protesters out of an administration building. − Christopher Cann [EU calls on Israel to abandon ground invasion of Rafah] Israel's warning on Rafah prompted a global outcry. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell denounced Israel's evacuation orders, saying they \"portend the worst: more war and famine.\" He called on Israel to drop plans for a ground offensive, saying the \"international community can and must act to prevent such scenario.\" Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also urged the world to act, warning that \"another massacre of the Palestinians is in the making.\" \"All must act now to prevent it. Failure to prevent the massacre will be an indelible stain on the international community,\" he said. \"Too many massacres have been allowed. Enough.\" [UN agencies warn humanitarian crisis will worsen] The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees warned that an Israeli offensive in Rafah would mean \"more civilian suffering and deaths.\" The consequences would be \"devastating\" for 1.4 million people, the agency said in a statement. Director Philippe Lazzarini urged both sides to reach agreement on a cease-fire or risk an expansion of the \"already man-made famine.\" \"UNRWA is not evacuating,\" the statement said. \"The agency will maintain a presence in Rafah as long as possible and will continue providing lifesaving aid to people.\" UNICEF warned that a \"military besiegement and ground incursion\" in Rafah would pose catastrophic risks to the 600,000 children sheltering there. Many already are injured, sick, malnourished, traumatized or living with disabilities, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said. “Many have been displaced multiple times and have lost homes, parents and loved ones,\" Russell said. \"They need to be protected.” ['There are no safe zones in Gaza'] \"A military offensive through Rafah risks becoming the deadliest phase of the horrific war in Gaza,\" Egeland said, adding that neighboring areas are destroyed or so overcrowded they cannot handle the influx of evacuees. The aid agency ActionAid warned of \"catastrophic consequences\" and urged the international community to \"act swiftly to prevent further atrocities.\" \"Our aid workers are reporting some of the most severe conditions in recent memory with widespread disease, starvation and chaos,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Let us be clear, there are no safe zones in Gaza.\" Contributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Reuters",

    "text": "Editor’s note: This is one in a continuing series of educational columns about fostering environmental stewardship and leadership coordinated by ACES — The Alliance of Climate and Environmental Stewards. Most of my daily activities and how I perform them consider reducing waste by reusing, repurposing, and recycling to cut my carbon footprint. This personal commitment not only benefits the planet, but also works best for my physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. My biggest contribution to cutting my personal carbon footprint is riding my e-bike from here in Seabrook to Newburyport on the rail trail. I go to Newburyport (my hometown) for many reasons, the most frequent (at least in summer) being to deliver my food waste to the Black Earth compost bins in the South End. I do this at least twice a week, weather permitting, which also helps reduce my methane footprint. With the melting permafrost and methane on fire in the Arctic, and methane gas being many times more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, impacts from methane emissions seem to be almost as much of a crisis as impacts from CO2 emissions. I have always been conscious of how much electricity and oil I use both for cost and for carbon footprint. I save a lot of fuel, especially at night, using low thermostat settings. However, I have continued to put more effort, creativity and money into trying to reduce my carbon footprint even more in this regard. Thanks to UNITIL’s monthly reports that use bar charts to compare neighbors with similar size homes, plus the current year’s usage compared to last year’s usage, I am glad to see that I have been in the “Good’ category for at least the last couple of years since I moved here mid-2018. I attribute the wintertime improvement partially to having had the attic and basement re-insulated. Since the room with the thermostat is not well insulated, I compensate by setting it between 55 and 60 to ensure that the other rooms maintain 65-68 during the day, then set the thermostat to 50 at night. In summertime I create a microclimate where ceiling fans pull the cold air from the upstairs AC to the downstairs. I use dehumidifiers when ambient temperatures are in the 60’s and 70’s. My use of a battery powered mower (the same one for almost 15 years) has further reduced my personal carbon footprint. Miscellaneous examples of reuse include: buying used clothes; refilling containers every week when I buy the toxic-free personal care and cleaning products from the Green House in Newburyport; reusing plastic cups from the Senior Center at Eastman Corners in Kingston, N.H.; collecting sticks, pinecones and pine needles to use for outdoor grilling in place of buying charcoal; collecting rainwater; printing on blank side of used paper I collect, mostly from mail. Thanks to the excellent marketing skills of the Newburyport Recycling Center, they accept the microplastics that I collect at the Joppa and Cashman launches. Since I dread shopping, I buy more selectively and carefully than most, usually dictated by health concerns. For example, I avoid aluminum, a neurotoxin, which unfortunately is ubiquitous in its use for cooking. My main source of inspiration comes from the first climate sustainability talk show PATTRN on Weather Underground. (I have the Weather Channel on most days to follow storm development, given my atmospheric and air quality studies in the 80’s, followed by 12 years of employment at NJDEP in the Bureau of Air Quality Management). The talk show hosts (also forecasters) interview spokespeople from many environmental nonprofits that I otherwise would never get to hear about, that have invented individual and collective solutions, even for plastic reuse and repurposing! Efforts are underway to replace black asphalt pavement, possibly with light hemp, to help reduce urban heat island effects. So don’t despair. There is much being done to help save our environment…and much that each one of us can do.

De acordo com o grupo islâmico, em comunicado, o seu chefe, Ismail Haniyeh, informou o primeiro-ministro do Qatar e o chefe dos serviços secretos do Egito da sua aceitação da proposta. Não foram divulgados pormenores imediatos sobre o conteúdo do acordo, avançou a ‘Reuters’. Recorde-se que o líder do Hamas indicou, no passado domingo, que o grupo está interessado em alcançar um cessar-fogo abrangente que acabe com a “agressão israelita”, garanta a retirada das tropas de Israel e chegue a um sério acordo de troca de reféns. Num comunicado citado pela agência Reuters, Haniyeh culpou ainda o primeiro-ministro israelita por continuar a agressão, pela “expansão do círculo do conflito” e ainda por “sabotar” os esforços dos mediadores. Já o primeiro-ministro israelita, Benjamin Netanyahu, voltou a rejeitar as exigências do Hamas para o fim da guerra em Gaza em troca da libertação de reféns. Netanyahu afirmou que aceitar esse acordo, iria manter o grupo no poder e isso representaria uma ameaça para Israel.",
