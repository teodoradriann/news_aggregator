    "text": "Wuyuan's natural beauty mesmerizes\nChina Daily | Updated: 2025-03-13 09:14\nNANCHANG — Since mid-March, Wuyuan county in Jiangxi province has entered its most enchanting season.\nAcross the undulating hills, a stunning expanse of 6,700 hectares of rapeseed flowers has burst into bloom, painting the landscape in vibrant hues of gold.\nAs the flowers reach their peak, waves of visitors from across the country witness this natural spectacle, turning Wuyuan into a bustling haven of beauty.\nScattered with historical sites and ancient buildings of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, Wuyuan boasts 30 traditional villages. In 2012, the county government adopted measures to protect and develop the ancient buildings.\nThe idyllic lifestyle has not only encouraged locals to return but also attracted many outsiders to settle down. Among them is Edward Gawne, the first British national to open a homestay in Wuyuan.\n\"There are trees, bridges, flowing water and beautiful Huizhou-style houses. It is how I imagined traditional Chinese culture would look like,\" Gawne said.\nWith China's ever-expanding high-speed rail network making the once-remote countryside easily accessible, Wuyuan has even attracted the interest of overseas travelers.\n\"Our B&B has served as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the West. About 90 percent of our guests are foreigners, and they can enjoy the beauty of Chinese traditional villages and learn about the culture and folk customs of Wuyuan and Jiangxi,\" Gawne said.\nThe story of Wuyuan is a shining example of how China's poverty alleviation and rural vitalization efforts have transformed the lives of countryside residents.\nOnce economically stagnant, the county of more than 300,000 people has undergone a remarkable transformation through land reform, poverty alleviation and infrastructure upgrades.\nSince the 2000s, Wuyuan has adopted an agriculture-tourism integration development model, combining traditional farming with tourism to develop distinctive industries such as rapeseed flower and chrysanthemum cultivation.\nThe initiative has spurred the growth of rural homestays, lifting the annual average per-capita income to more than 26,000 yuan ($3,600) in 2023 from less than 3,000 yuan in 2002.\nIn 2023, Wuyuan welcomed over 28 million visitors, cementing its status as a top-tier tourist destination in rural China.\nAs China's rural vitalization gains momentum, Wuyuan is further transforming its local resources into a thriving, diverse tourism industry. A nature education hub operated by young graduates has become an in-demand destination with eager participants booking spots three months in advance.\nFrom wetland explorations and building bird nests to observing bacteria under microscopes, the education hub's hands-on activities captivate children and parents alike.\n\"We're using Wuyuan's natural beauty and our expertise to make science fun and accessible,\" said Liu Zhilong, who runs the nature education hub, adding that over 60,000 children and 10,000 parents have joined their nature lessons.\nThese achievements stem from Wuyuan's groundbreaking \"mini nature reserve\" system, launched in the early 1990s. Today, the county boasts 193 such reserves, spanning 43,600 hectares and safeguarding rare species such as the critically endangered blue-crowned laughing-thrush.\nThis dedication to conservation has fueled economic growth, with bird-watching tourism alone generating over 100 million yuan in 2023.\nParty chief Xu Shubin stated that Wuyuan has successfully turned its ecological strengths into economic benefits.\nVillagers, now reaping the rewards of this green development, have become even more dedicated to protecting their beautiful homeland.\n\"This commitment has fostered a win-win cycle. Protecting the environment drives the green economy, and the resulting success inspires villagers to care even more for their natural surroundings, promoting true harmony between people and nature,\" Xu said.\nXinhua",

    "text": "A new report from online career platform LiveCareer reveals workplace trust issues across generations, with Gen Z employees least likely to trust their employer’s leadership.\nThe report found that one in four (25%) workers don’t trust their manager to act in their best interests, and 40% have quit a job due to distrust in their manager. Forty-three percent of respondents say that Gen Z is the most likely to challenge leadership decisions openly.\nFor its Generational Workplace Trust report, LiveCareer polled 1,000 U.S. workers on their feelings about the level of trust the workplace has in corporate management and how those feelings differ by generation.\nTrust between employees and their managers is a critical element of workplace success. However, many workers report varying levels of trust in their managers’ ability to act in their best interests.\n- 25% don’t fully trust their manager to make decisions that prioritize their needs, goals, and overall well-being.\n- 53% have felt lied to or misled by a manager.\n- Respondents report that favoritism (23%), unethical behavior (18%), and poor communication (17%) are the top three factors that most damage employees’ trust in their managers.\nThe report also found a lack of accountability among those in management positions:\n- 48% say their manager acknowledges mistakes but downplays them.\n- 29% report their manager takes full responsibility for mistakes.\n- 23% have managers that don’t admit fault when they make a mistake.\n“The bottom line is that poor relationships between managers and their employees can have serious consequences,” LiveCareer said. “Forty percent of respondents reported that they have left a job because they did not trust their manager.”\nThe report found that workplace trust isn’t universal—it shifts across generations. Older generations place more confidence in corporate leadership, while those newer to the workforce remain skeptical about their company’s top brass.\n- A majority (54%) say baby boomers trust corporate leadership the most.\n- Nearly half (45%) of workers believe Gen Z has the least trust in corporate leadership.\nGen Z is redefining workplace dynamics by challenging leadership more openly than previous generations, according to the report. With a strong willingness to voice concerns and question decisions, they’re pushing for greater accountability and transparency in the workplace.\n- 40% of workers believe Gen Z is the generation most likely to raise concerns when they disagree with leadership.\n- 43% of respondents say Gen Z is the most willing to push back against leadership choices.\n- 34% feel baby boomers are least likely to voice their concerns about company leadership.\n“While more seasoned professionals often have strong criticisms of Gen Z, the root issue is that many managers are either unwilling or slow to adapt to a different leadership style that works best for younger workers,” Jasmine Escalera, career expert for LiveCareer, said in a statement. “While Gen Z’s outspokenness may be surprising for managers used to working with baby boomers, Gen X, and millennial professionals, leaders should instead appreciate this level of transparency. We are in the middle of the Great Detachment and can use this feedback to course correct.”\nAccording to the report, the one common thread across age groups is a significant gap in understanding between themselves and leadership. Regardless of generation, the majority of respondents (63%) say that leaders don’t understand the priorities and challenges of their specific generation.\nThanks for reading CPA Practice Advisor!\nSubscribe\nAlready registered?

    "title": "Message Of Peace In Nagasaki Politicized – OpEd",
    "text": "As the two unfortunate Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that fell victims to atomic bombing in August 1945 by the US bringing the War to an end, the annual peace ceremonies held in the two cities every year in the past 79 years showed cracks this year as the administrators in both cities were not on the same page as both demonstrated differences in their respective invitee list with one inviting, and the other not inviting Israel presently in conflict in West Asia and destruction of Gaza. As a result, the conscience of the world that reiterates the resolve to eliminate this destructive arsenal from the earth received a setback.\nThe annual ceremonies held in August every year to mark the 1945 atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are occasions to mourn the victims, recall the devastation and resolve anew to never use nuclear weapons again. This was vitiated this year by deciding certain country not to invite for the ceremony. Here, Hiroshima and Nagasaki differed.\nUnlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki did not want the Israeli ambassador to attend the ceremony commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing. Deploring a ‘politicization’ of the event, Western countries chose not to send their ambassadors. That it took a political turn was indeed unfortunate.\nIn his traditional declaration for peace, Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki lamented the “uncertainty about when the Russian invasion of Ukraine will come to an end and growing concern about the expansion of armed conflicts in the Middle East,” and said that “we are currently facing a critical situation with the increased likelihood of the disappearance of the important norm that we have conformed to thus far,” namely, “never using a nuclear weapon again.” His speech in the sweltering heat of Peace Park was punctuated by verses by the poet Sumako Fukuda (1922-1974) a bomb survivor and anti-nuclear activist.\nWhile Nagasaki Mayor Suzuki decided not to invite Israel to the annual peace memorial ceremony, his counterpart in Hiroshima extended the usual invitation to the Israeli ambassador. Since 2022, Russia and Belarus have been left off the list in Nagasaki because of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.\nThe solemnity of the occasion was thus overshadowed the controversy surrounding the preparations for the ceremony. In fact, as early as in June, Suzuki had raised the non-invitation of Israel issue. He made it official on 31 July, saying it was based on a hope for a “ceremony conducted smoothly under a solemn atmosphere.” The mayor denied any political motivation: “August 9 is the most important day of the year for the city of Nagasaki. The average age of survivors is now over 85,” explained the son of hibakushas (survivors). At the same time, Nagasaki invited the Palestinian Authority, which “is not a party to the conflict” between Israel and Hamas. The memory of the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki fuels a powerful pacifist current in both cities. For months, the hibakushas had been pleading for Israel not to be invited to the commemorations. Suzuki just respected such prevailing sentiment.\nTo register their protest, the US and British ambassadors, Rahm Emanuel and Juli Longbottom, their colleagues from Germany, France, Italy and the EU, Canada and Australia also decided to stay out. The message was loud and clear: these countries openly announcing their support with Israel. To add fuel to the fire, Israel ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, reminded the Nagasaki Mayor that his country has been brutally attacked by terrorist organisations and by not sending an invite, the Mayor was sending “a wrong message to the world”. The popular Asahi Shimbun observed in an editorial that this “disheartening diplomatic gesture [has] seriously undermined the years of efforts to raise global engagement and dedication to the cause and lacks a convincing rationale.”\nSuzuki had the support of the 83-year-old head of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council, who justified the decision not to invite representatives from countries that were waging armed conflicts in defiance of calls from the international community. The remarks of some Israeli ministers against the adversaries in Gaza calling for retributions against Palestinian detainees and prisoners, if true, are condemnable but snubbing Israel by not inviting for a peace ceremony that entailed a message to the world to rid of nuclear weapons divides the world rather than unites in this noble mission.\nThough the decision to invite or not to invite to the ceremony certain country rests with the host city/country, in the present context, power politics surfaced as the US and the UK reacted negatively to Nagasaki’s decision. The Asahi Shimbun editorial observed that “equating Israel and Russia could lead to misunderstanding”.\nHere, the case of Israel’s retaliation to brutal attack on its citizens by the Hamas compared to Russia’s unprovoked and unilateral military operation in Ukraine is incomparable. May be the US, UK, the EC and other countries were miffed because of Israel’s non-invitation. Suzuki felt Israel’s reprisals against Hamas in Gaza caused massive civilian casualties, which the countries that skipped the peace ceremony overlooked and thus condoned. It is ironical that while the response of the uninvited countries to Israel’s ruthless military actions received little attention to humanitarian concerns and thus remained tepid, by boycotting the peace ceremonies, the US, UK, EU countries and others, as the Asahi Shimbun editorial observed, brought this ethical “double standards” to the A-bomb arena.\nThe moot question that begs an answer is: why did the Kishida government remain silent and failed to foresee the reaction that Israel’s exclusion would incur and found wanting in handling the issue appropriately? It was he who hosted the G-7 Summit in 2023 in Hiroshima, his home town, and encouraged world leaders to visit the atomic-bombed sites and the Hiroshima Peace Museum. Though Nagasaki municipal government took precautionary step by sending a letter in advance to Israel for its non-invitation, did Kishida not pre-empt such a decision would create an international controversy?\nIn this respect, Hiroshima’s handling the peace ceremony was more matured as it invited the Israeli ambassador to its ceremony on 6 August, despite requests from hibakusha groups to exclude Israel. In contrast, Nagasaki seems to have failed in sending the ceremony’s message of peace to the world appropriately.",

    "title": "Dan Pembroke smashes world record en route to retaining Paralympic javelin title - Limerick Live",
    "text": "British javelin star Dan Pembroke delivered on his word by twice breaking the world record en route to becoming double Paralympic champion in Paris. The 33-year-old had made little secret of his intent of bettering the previous best global mark of 71.01 metres, set by Uzbekistan’s Aleksandr Svechnikov back in 2017, having been 51 centimetres away from it last year. He initially stretched the record to 71.15m before producing a mammoth throw of 74.49m to emphatically retain the F13 title he memorably clinched with a then Games record of 69.52m on a rain-soaked day in Tokyo. World champion Pembroke stood with his arms aloft as he absorbed the acclaim of the Stade de France crowd before blowing kisses to spectators revelling in his unprecedented achievement. His success brought ParalympicsGB’s third athletics podium place on Thursday after wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn won her fourth medal of the Games with 400m silver following F35 shot put bronze for Anna Nicholson. Pembroke was first up and led the contest throughout, having begun with a season’s best effort of 68.39m, which was more than seven metres superior to the rest of the field in round one. The visually-impaired athlete, who was poised to represent his country at the London 2012 Olympics before a snapped elbow ligament ruined that dream and ultimately prompted his journey in Para sport, was just getting started. After Svechnikov’s seven-year record fell in round three, Pembroke again broke new ground with his next attempt, potentially fuelled by Iranian rival Ali Pirouj providing food for thought with a throw of 69.74m. Pirouj’s best was as close as anyone came to stealing the thunder of Pembroke, who celebrated gold by jubilantly running into the centre of the field and bowing to his supporters before performing laps of the track wrapped in the Union Jack. Earlier, Kinghorn, who became 100m champion on Wednesday, continued her unforgettable Games by clocking 53.45 seconds in the T53 400m, 1.85secs behind Swiss gold medallist Catherine Debrunner. “I’m absolutely buzzing with it; four from four, I can’t be disappointed in that at all,” said the 28-year-old Scot, who has also won 800m and 1500m silver in France. “It’s been amazing, I’ve definitely done a lot better than I thought I would coming in.” Subscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie Buy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sports Chiefs handle brutal conditions of 4th coldest game in NFL history, beat Dolphins to move on to potential road playoff game Frank Schwab NFL/betting writer Sun, Jan 14, 2024, 6:17 AM · 4 min read 172\nJust because the Kansas City Chiefs don't live in South Florida, it didn't mean the conditions Saturday night at Arrowhead Stadium were easy for them. Playing in a freezer isn't good for anyone.\nBut the Chiefs handled the sub-zero temperatures a lot better than the Miami Dolphins . The Chiefs aren't a pretty team this season, but they have some toughness. Kansas City 's defense is the best it has been in the Patrick Mahomes era, and that was huge on Saturday. Isiah Pacheco is a tough runner and that helped too. And mentally, the Chiefs were up for the challenge against the Dolphins.\nThe Chiefs are moving on after a 26-7 win over the Dolphins in horrible weather conditions. They settled for a lot of field goals but that was enough because, other than one big play to Tyreek Hill , Miami's offense generated almost nothing. The Dolphins haven't won a playoff game since the 2000 season.\nThis hasn't been an easy season for the Chiefs, but they're in the NFL's final eight. And perhaps the tough lessons will help next weekend when Kansas City potentially faces a first: A road playoff game with Mahomes at quarterback.\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes celebrates with wide receiver Rashee Rice after a 1-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter. (Photo by Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Frigid conditions in Kansas City The temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees, making it the fourth-coldest game in NFL history. The wind chill was -27 at kickoff. That was the third-coldest wind chill at kickoff in NFL history.\nIn other words, it was miserable.\nThere were moments in which both offenses struggled with simple tasks they make look easy in regular weather. But the Chiefs handled the cold better than the Dolphins .\nMiami had one big play in the first half. Hill beat the defense deep for a 53-yard touchdown catch. That accounted for more than half of Tua Tagovailoa 's 94 passing yards in the first half. He completed just 6 of 11 passes before halftime. When the Chiefs took a 26-7 lead in the fourth quarter, Tagovailoa had just 100 yards.\nTouchdown Kansas City! @isiah_pachecoRB finishes a 14-play, 72-yard drive. Chiefs lead, 26-7. #MIAvsKC on Peacock\nAlso available on #NFLPlus https://t.co/bTakd7vjlv pic.twitter.com/suJ8jichcr\n— NFL (@NFL) January 14, 2024\nThe Chiefs were much more effective moving the ball. Mahomes had 167 passing yards at the half. The Chiefs' offense stalled a few times but KC led 16-7 at the end of the first half.\nThe Chiefs had some rhythm on offense, unlike the Dolphins. But they had mistakes, the most notable of which was a blocking-in-the-back penalty on offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor that nullified a touchdown.\nWhile the Chiefs should have held a bigger lead at the half, it didn't matter. The Dolphins were incapable of generating any consistent offense.\nChiefs advance to divisional round It was clear early in the second half that the Dolphins were not coming back. Their offense has struggled against good competition all season, and it disappeared in the cold on Saturday night. The Chiefs' defense had a lot to do with that.\nThe Dolphins gave away their last chance on a horrible roughing the passer penalty against defensive tackle Christian Wilkins after Mahomes had thrown incomplete on third-and-20. Pacheco scored shortly after and the game was all but over. Miami took on many injuries late in the season, and its late-season slide continued right out of the postseason with a lackluster performance at Kansas City.\nThe Chiefs could find themselves back at Arrowhead Stadium next week if they get a Pittsburgh Steelers upset over the Buffalo Bills on Monday. If the Bills win, the Chiefs will be at Buffalo in the divisional round. Mahomes, who is in his seventh NFL season, has yet to play a true road game in the playoffs.\nThis version of the Chiefs doesn't seem like it can go on the road and win a playoff game against a team like Buffalo. Everything has been a little tougher this season for the offense. The receivers, other than rookie Rashee Rice (who had 130 yards and a touchdown Saturday night), never made much of an impact. Tight end Travis Kelce hasn't produced his usual numbers this season. The reason the Chiefs might have to go on the road next week is they're not a dominant team and they took six losses in the regular season.\nBut the Chiefs are alive. They still have Mahomes and Andy Reid. Their defense is one of the best in the NFL. There's still hope for another Super Bowl run, even if the path would be much different this season.",

    "text": "2024 was the worst ever for commercial cyber attacks in the UK, new research suggests, with remote IoT devices attracting the most attacks.\nDuring 2024, UK firms each experienced an average of more than 753,341 malicious attempts to breach their online and IT systems , according to analysis by specialist business ISP Beaming.\nThat was 4% higher than in 2023 - itself a record year - making last year the worst ever for attempted cyber attacks, with businesses encountering a new online threat every 42 seconds.\nBefore 2024, the average number of attacks in a single quarter had only exceeded 2,000 in Q4 2023.\n\"The rise of automated cyber attacks means the internet has never been more dangerous, and we expect it will become even more so as hackers use AI ,\" said Beaming managing director Sonia Blizzard.\n\"The good news is that we are not seeing record numbers of companies crippled by hackers because businesses have got better at protecting themselves.\"\nThe most frequent targets last year were remotely-controlled IoT devices, with more than 161 daily attacks targeting applications such as building control systems, security cameras, networked printers, remote monitoring , and industrial automation systems.",

    "text": "Premier League\nEl Liverpool sale aún más reforzado de un Boxing Day en el que pincharon Chelsea, United y City\nLos 'reds' remontaron al Leicester (3-1) y son más líderes\nLos de Guardiola empataron (1-1) en casa contra el Everton\nEl Chelsea se vio sorprendido por el Fulham y los 'red devils' por los Wolves\nEP\nEl [Liverpool](/tags/liverpool-fc/) disfrutó del Boxing Day de la [Premier](/tags/premier-league/) con una remontada (3-1) ante el Leicester con la que aumentó su condición de líder, gracias también a la derrota (1-2) del [Chelsea](/tags/chelsea-fc/) ante el Fulham, mientras que el [Manchester City](/tags/manchester-city/) y el [United](/tags/manchester-united/) alargaron sus crisis en un 1-1 contra el Everton y un 2-0 ante el Wolves.\nEl equipo 'red' tuvo más emoción de la esperada en Anfield, ante el tercer equipo por la cola de la tabla, pero no tardó en enderezar un camino que no parece tener quién lo tuerza. En medio de la niebla apareció Jordan Ayew para adelantar a los 'Foxes', a los cinco minutos, cuando el Liverpool ya había tenido un par de ocasiones.\nLos de Ruud van Nistelrooy fueron valientes y tuvieron la opción incluso del segundo, pero el cuadro local sacó el rodillo. Aunque se hizo esperar el gol, justo antes del descanso, Cody Gakpo firmó un disparo perfecto para el 1-1. El asedio siguió en la reanudación y Curtis Jones rubricó la remontada, con algo de suspense del VAR. Sin duda era cuestión de tiempo, como el gol de Mo Salah, un pase a la red en el 82' del mejor jugador de la Premier.\nAsí, el líder Liverpool sumó 42 puntos, siete más y aún con un partido menos que un Chelsea que dejó escapar la victoria en los últimos minutos del derbi contra el Fulham, que logró su primer triunfo en 45 años en Stamford Bridge.\nLos de Enzo Maresca se adelantaron con el 1-0 que firmó Cole Palmer al cuarto de hora, prometiendo una jornada navideña redonda para los 'blues'. Sin embargo, los de Marco Silva, en busca de una sexta jornada seguida sin perder, no dejaron de intentarlo y encontraron una épica remontada con los cambios. Harry Wilson, en el 82', y Rodrigo Muniz, en el 95', bajaron las aspiraciones de título de un Chelsea que venía de empatar con el Everton.\nPor otro lado, el Boxing Day sonrió a un Nottingham Forest que sigue volando para asentarse en el 'Top 4', con un 1-0 sobre un Tottenham tocado, solo una victoria en seis jornadas. Mientras, Newcastle y Bournemouth también alargaron su buena dinámica en puestos europeos a costa del Aston Villa (3-0) y el Crystal Palace.\nLa racha goleadora de Alexander Isak continuó en el triunfo local en St. James' Park, donde el Villa de Unai Emery jugó con uno menos desde la roja a Jhon Duran a la media hora. Mientras, el Bournemouth de Andoni Iraola no pudo (0-0) con el Palace en un encuentro igualado y sin grandes ocasiones pero sigue sumando en zona noble.\nPesadilla de los de Manchester en Navidad\nAdemás, en el duelo que abrió la jornada, el Manchester City alargó su crisis con un 1-1 ante el Everton. Los de Pep Guardiola no encuentran fin a su pesadilla: una victoria en los últimos 13 partidos entre todas las competiciones. En el Etihad Stadium, el City perdonó y volvió a ver los fantasmas de otro tropiezo más, sobre todo cuando Erling Haaland falló un penalti ante Jordan Pickford en el inicio del segundo tiempo.\nEl partido había empezado de cara para el campeón con el 1-0 de Bernardo Silva y el propio portugués perdonó el segundo, pero pronto empató el Everton, en la primera que tuvo, con Iliman Ndiaye. Tampoco acertó el equipo de Guardiola en un quiero y no puedo en el segundo tiempo, para quedarse séptimo en la tabla (28), a cinco puntos de la zona Champions y a 14 del Liverpool con un partido más.\nAdemás, el Manchester United encajó otro mal resultado con un Ruben Amorim que parece lejos de resucitar a los 'red devils'. La roja de Bruno Fernandes y el partidazo de Matheus Cunha, con gol olímpico y asistencia ya en el descuento para Hee-Chan Hwang, sirvieron el dos de dos del nuevo técnico del Wolves, un Vitor Pereira que sí funciona como revulsivo.\nResultados\n- Manchester City - Everton 1-1.\n- Bournemouth - Crystal Palace 0-0.\n- Chelsea - Fulham 1-2.\n- Newcastle - Aston Villa 3-0.\n- Nottingham Forest - Tottenham 1-0.\n- Southampton - West Ham 0-1.\n- Wolverhampton - Manchester United 2-0.\n- Liverpool - Leicester 3-1.\n-Viernes 27.\n- Brighton - Brentford.\n- Arsenal - Ipswich.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20https://www.elcorreogallego.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941098.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941098.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941098.html&text=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20%20https://www.elcorreogallego.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941098.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40elcorreogallego)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20&body=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941098.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",
