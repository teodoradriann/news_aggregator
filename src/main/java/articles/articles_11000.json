    "title": "The Japanese are now making diamond processors!",
    "text": "Semiconductor technology is constantly in search of stronger, more efficient and more durable materials. This search has led scientists to one of nature’s hardest and most precious materials: diamond. Accordingly, diamond has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry.\nDiamond could revolutionize semiconductor technology\nDiamond is attracting attention in the world of electronics thanks to its hardness and thermal conductivity. Diamond-based power devices, which can offer 10 times more performance compared to standard silicon semiconductors, are getting closer to commercialization thanks to Japan-based developments.\nAt the component level, diamond can handle about 50,000 times more electricity than silicon. It can also operate at five times higher temperatures. This makes it indispensable for applications that require large power supplies, such as electric vehicles, airplanes, power grids and nuclear power plants.\nThe fact that diamond is a difficult material to process posed significant technological obstacles in the production of electronics-grade substrates. But Japanese companies have made great progress in this field. Last year, Saga University produced the world’s first diamond-based power circuit. And Orbray paved the way for mass production of 2-inch diamond chips.\nIn 2024, the momentum continues. Power Diamond Systems introduced diamond hardware capable of handling 6.8 amps of current. It also aims to start commercial shipments in a few years. And Ookuma Diamond Device is building a factory to produce diamond semiconductors from 2026.\nExperts predict that diamond-based microprocessors will complete the transition from the lab to the market between 2025 and 2030. Companies manufacturing synthetic diamonds and semiconductor equipment will benefit from this growth as they move closer to commercial use.",

    "text": "SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois House gave its approval to legislation that would give high school athletes a limited right to compete in non-school events or on non-school teams during the same season in which they play for their school.\nThe House voted 68-39 on April 9 to pass a scaled-back version of a bill known as the Right to Play Act. It would partially override an existing rule of the Illinois High School Association that says students who participate on a school team may not also participate on a non-school team or compete in outside tournaments or events in the same sport during the same season, unless they obtain permission from both their school and IHSA.\nThe association currently allows students to obtain as many as three waivers in a season to compete in outside contests or tournaments if those events are sanctioned by the sport’s national governing body.\nRep. Janet Yang-Rohr, D-Naperville, said she thinks that rule is too restrictive because it doesn’t allow for events sponsored by international sports organizations.\n“Our athletes right now in Illinois have to decline invitations from FIFA (the international soccer governing body), from the Olympic development program, from offers to play with national teams in Canada and Scotland, because these IHSA rules compel the organization to deny their waiver requests,” she said on the House floor. “This legislation will finally be able to let those student athletes participate in those events too.”\nUnder the amended bill, student athletes would be able to obtain waivers for as many as two outside events per year, including “all-star team” events. But they would only need the agreement of their school’s principal or athletics director, not IHSA. The bill also would not require the events to be sanctioned by any official governing body.\nThat is significantly more restrictive than the original bill, which would have removed the prohibition on simultaneous participation almost entirely. It would have prohibited participating in both a school competition or practice and a non-school activity on the same day.\nRead more: ‘Right to Play’ bill that would affect high school athletes advances in House\nThat proposal passed out of the House Education Policy Committee in March, despite warnings from some critics that allowing unrestricted dual participation could endanger the health and safety of the athletes while also setting up the possibility of conflict between a school coach and non-school coach.\nBut Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills, who voted for the amended bill, said during floor debate that he would have preferred going even further in limiting the authority of IHSA.\n“This is an unfortunate turn with your amendments, but I completely appreciate … what you had to do to get this started,” he said during floor debate. “But frankly, let’s next year – and I’ll join you – get this completely wiped out. Get the IHSA back in the lane where they should be, which is to be fair and to allow all these students to have every equal opportunity for scholarships that they can get.”\nIHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in an email Wednesday that the association still opposes the proposed legislation because it puts principals and athletic directors in charge of deciding whether a student should be granted a waiver.\n“It’s my understanding that the schools prefer a process whereby review of such participation is considered by the Association to create equity in opportunities across the membership,” Anderson said.\nThe bill now awaits further action in the Senate.\nCapitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service that distributes state government coverage to hundreds of news outlets statewide.
