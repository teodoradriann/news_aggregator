    "title": "​Dad discovers child has pinworms and it's freaking people out",
    "text": "[Parenting](https://www.upworthy.com/family/parenting/) Dad discovers his child has pinworms and now the entire internet is rethinking parenting It’s totally common and absolutely gross. If you're a parent you're likely in one of two categories: parents who have never heard of pinworms or parents who shuttered at the headline. Parents are not really given any sort of warning for all of the eyebrow raising situations that occur in childhood and one dad has found out that there was a lot left out of that non-existent parenting handbook. Justin, a dad that runs the [TikTok page drumbeatlane](https://www.tiktok.com/@drumbeatlane) took to social media to tell the world of the current nightmare fuel parenting situation he was experiencing. He's also doing parents on social media a solid by giving them a heads up on the disturbing secret plaguing the parenting world–pinworms. The viral video starts out with no trigger warning before he says though clenched teeth, \"my son has worms in his anus.\" Yeah, you read that right. It's a thing. A slightly terrifying but totally normal thing. \"No one tells you about this stuff when you're thinking about being a parent but apparently it's like super normal for a child to just have worms in his booty hole,\" Justin says. [Dr. Cerissa Key](https://www.tiktok.com/@therealdrkey), a pediatrician, chimed in on Justin's disturbing revelation and assured him and every parent watching that pinworms are a common thing that happens in young children. But she also dropped some info that other's including Justin may not have been ready to hear. \"Justin, sir. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But if your son has worms in his booty hole, sir, politely and respectfully, you also have worms in your booty hole,\" Key reveals. Key goes on to explain that kids are \"disgusting\" and don't wash their hands well so pinworms spread easily if a child at school or daycare has them. She advises that parents stock up on the chalky banana flavored medication that clears them up and to wash everything on hot while being sure to vacuum your floors well. [@drumbeatlane] Parenting truly is just one surprise after another. But the biggest surprise to me every time something crazy happens is that it is usually super common, just no one talks about it. So I’m warning you. Your child might get worms in their anus. #justinkellough #dadsoftiktok #parentsoftiktok #momsoftiktok #parentingadvice #parenting @Justin People in the comment section of both videos were horrified that this was an actual thing while others commiserated with the stressed dad. \"I have no kids and now I'm paranoid I have pinworms with no symptoms,\" one person writes. \"I've raised 4 kids and never had this happen. Tomorrow this will be my entry on my gratitude journal,\" a mom confesses. \"Do I have kids? No...Do I even work around kids? Also no...do I still have the urge to take this medicine just in case anyways? 1 %,\" someone says. [@therealdrkey] #stitch with @Justin A about pinworms! It your kid has them, YOU have them. 😩 #pinworms #pinworm #pediatrician #momlife #itchybottom #itchyvulva #pinwormssuck #parenting Not everyone was stressed, some were thankful for the information. \"Thank you! We haven't experienced pinworms yet, but super informative and helps to make parenting normalized,\" another commenter writes. Key suggests that if your child has pinworms that the entire family should take a dose of the medication two weeks apart to make sure any left over newly hatched eggs are also killed. While you may not have been warned about pinworms, no one ever said parenting would be glamorous. It just seems people weren't prepared for how unglamorous it could get.",

    "text": "Cientistas do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jato (JPL) da NASA identificaram que uma cidade localizada na Península de Palos Verdes, no sul da Califórnia, está enfrentando um deslizamento de terra significativo.\nA instabilidade do solo na área, observada com o uso de radar de alta precisão, tem levado a um deslocamento que pode comprometer a segurança da região, com movimentos de até 10 centímetros por semana.\nO fenômeno, que já ocorre há mais de seis décadas, apresentou uma aceleração notável nos últimos tempos, especialmente após as fortes chuvas de 2023 e o inverno chuvoso de 2024.\nEstes eventos climáticos intensificados provavelmente têm contribuído para o agravamento da instabilidade do solo, gerando preocupações entre especialistas e autoridades locais.\nTecnologias Avançadas Monitoram Movimento do Solo\nA NASA utilizou a tecnologia de radar UAVSAR (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) para monitorar o deslocamento do solo na região com alta precisão.\nEntre 18 de setembro e 17 de outubro de 2024, uma aeronave Gulfstream III foi enviada para sobrevoar a área quatro vezes, coletando dados tridimensionais que permitiram uma análise detalhada da situação.\nAlém disso, satélites Sentinel-1A e 1B, da Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA), contribuíram com informações adicionais.\nOs dados capturados por esses satélites permitiram a geração de mapas que destacam áreas com deslocamento acelerado, as quais foram indicadas por cores escuras.\nEsses mapas foram compartilhados com as autoridades da Califórnia e também disponibilizados no Portal de Mapeamento de Desastres da NASA, uma ferramenta essencial para monitorar e mitigar desastres naturais.\nA aceleração do deslizamento tem causado preocupação não apenas em termos de segurança, mas também pela possibilidade de que o movimento do solo possa comprometer a infraestrutura local e levar áreas inteiras da cidade em direção ao oceano, caso a tendência continue. Autoridades locais estão monitorando a situação de perto, embora não haja medidas definitivas para conter o processo.\nCaso Similar no Brasil Aumenta Preocupações sobre Erosão Costeira\nEm outro caso de erosão costeira, em Atafona, distrito de São João da Barra, no Rio de Janeiro, o fenômeno tem se intensificado nas últimas décadas.\nO nível do mar na região já subiu 13 cm, e especialistas preveem que o aumento chegará a 16 cm até 2050. A elevação do nível do mar tem causado danos significativos à comunidade local, com casas submersas e pescadores sem meios de sustento.\nA erosão costeira em Atafona, que se iniciou na década de 1950, tem se acelerado nos últimos anos, destruindo mais de 500 residências e forçando a migração de mais de 2.000 pessoas.\nA crescente perda de território e a escassez de soluções efetivas têm gerado crescente pressão sobre as autoridades para que adotem medidas mais eficazes, embora o problema se mostre complexo e sem soluções simples.\nO geógrafo Dieter Muehe, especialista em erosão costeira, alertou para o aumento do avanço do mar em áreas como Atafona, que ocorre a uma média de 3 metros por ano.\nMuehe ressaltou que esse processo de erosão tem sido exacerbado pela interação entre atividades humanas e as mudanças climáticas, e que o impacto na região provavelmente continuará nos próximos anos, levando a mais danos às infraestruturas e à população local.\nImplicações para as Comunidades Costeiras\nEsses dois casos, um na Califórnia e o outro no Brasil, ilustram o impacto crescente da erosão costeira e dos deslizamentos de terra nas comunidades litorâneas.\nA interação entre mudanças climáticas, aumento do nível do mar e eventos climáticos extremos tem acelerado esses processos, colocando em risco a segurança e a subsistência de muitas pessoas que vivem nessas regiões.\nEspecialistas alertam para a necessidade de medidas preventivas e soluções adaptativas para lidar com essas questões.\nEmbora os métodos tradicionais de mitigação, como a construção de barreiras e a contenção de encostas, possam ajudar a minimizar os danos em algumas áreas, a constante evolução desses fenômenos requer uma abordagem mais ampla e integrada.\nAs autoridades locais e internacionais devem priorizar a pesquisa científica e a implementação de políticas públicas que busquem mitigar os efeitos do avanço do mar e dos deslizamentos de terra, protegendo tanto as comunidades quanto a infraestrutura crítica.\nTanto a cidade da Califórnia quanto a região de Atafona enfrentam desafios consideráveis, com suas populações lidando com a ameaça constante de desastres naturais.\nA comunidade científica continua a monitorar a situação e a buscar soluções eficazes, mas os próximos anos serão cruciais para determinar o futuro dessas regiões afetadas.",

    "text": "Mom Forces Her Whole Family To Share One Stick Of Deodorant Despite Her Husband Begging For His Own\nShe claims that it saves them money. However, research suggests it's unsanitary.\nA woman blew the minds of internet users after she revealed her controversial family hack for saving money on personal care products.\nThe mom forces her family to share one stick of deodorant to save money, much to the chagrin of her husband.\nThe mother, @missusmom, unveiled her shocking revelation in a TikTok video that has been viewed over 1.4 million times. \"Do all of the people in your house share deodorant,\" she asked viewers, \"or does each member that wears deodorant have their own stick of deodorant?\"\nThe woman clarified that her husband shares a stick with their son, while she shares a stick with their daughters.\nHowever, her husband recently reached his wit's end regarding her frugal personal care decision.\nAfter getting out of the shower and being unable to find the shared deodorant, her husband asked why their son couldn't just have his own. The woman seemed perplexed by his suggestion.\n“Why would he have his own? I’m not paying for another stick of deodorant,” she said.\nWhen\nher husband pointed out that it was “gross” for multiple people to share one stick of deodorant, she dismissed his claims, pointing out that she is happy to share deodorant with their daughters.\nHowever, her husband argued that since men generally have more hair under their arms, it was unsanitary for them to share products like deodorant. He insisted that he be able to purchase separate sticks of deodorant for himself and their son.\nStill, the woman refused.\n“I’m not buying five to eight sticks of deodorant every month,” she insisted. “I would need to put\nextra money into our budget.”\nNew Africa | Shutterstock\nThe woman claimed that the specific brand of deodorant they use costs $10 per stick and that she did not want to dish out $60 to $80 on deodorant for her family when she believed it was unnecessary.\n“Am I crazy and wrong or is he delusional?” the woman asked viewers about her husband.\nMost commenters argued that it is unsanitary for multiple people to share one deodorant stick and that each person should have their own.\n“Oh no no no... that's like sharing used toilet paper. Just so gross,” one TikTok user commented.\n“Toothbrushes, razors, hairbrushes, and deodorant are not a shared product. What if someone had a staph infection or impetigo?” another user remarked.\nOthers did not understand exactly how the woman was saving money by buying one stick of deodorant.\n“I’m confused. Aren’t you finishing the deodorant twice as fast by sharing anyway? So buying everyone their own would just make you replace less frequently,” one commenter astutely wrote.\nIn a follow-up video, the woman admitted that she had never sat down and calculated the cost of how much it would be if she bought each member of the family their own deodorant stick or determined how frequently they go through them.\nShe added that all of the girls in the house preferred the same scent, as well as the boys, so it made sense to share one stick. “It doesn’t bother us,” the woman claimed.\nShe further attempted to defend her decision by sharing that everyone in her family applies deodorant to clean armpits. “All of us apply it directly from the shower. Are you people not doing that?\" she asked. \"Do you not apply [deodorant] directly onto clean armpits after a shower?”\n“Nobody’s going in there with sweaty armpits and putting on deodorant. If we have sweaty armpits, we’re taking a shower and then putting it on clean armpits,” she continued.\nThe woman also claimed that since she and her family use clinical-strength deodorant, they do not need to reapply throughout the day.\n“It is nothing like sharing used toilet paper. It is nothing like sharing a freaking toothbrush,” she said.\nIn another video, the woman revealed that she lived in a six-person household growing up, and had become accustomed to sharing products like soap, washcloths, and deodorant.\n[Mom Calls Parents Who Put Their Kids' Names On School Supplies 'Weird' — 'If Someone Should Need Them They Should Have Access To Them'](/self/mom-calls-parents-weird-putting-kids-names-school-supplies?utm_medium=amp-mid-recent-block)\nWhile it may seem like a convenient money-saving hack, doctors warn against sharing deodorant with multiple people, even family members.\nSharing deodorant can easily lead to the transmission of bacteria, skin fungi, and other microbes that harbor the armpits.\nBoard-certified dermatologist\nDr. Marnie B. Nussbaum told Fresh Monster that sharing deodorant can \"leave microscopic cuts in the skin, allowing blood-borne pathogens to be transferred via deodorant.\"\nThese blood-borne pathogens include HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and other dangerous conditions.\nDespite this information, 35% of Americans report that they are willing to share their antiperspirants with their family members,\nper a 2022 Drive Research survey.\nEven if we are in dire need of borrowing someone else’s deodorant, we must keep in mind that they are\ncalled “PERSONAL hygiene” products for a reason. Sharing snacks and clothes is one thing. Transferring sweat and skin bacteria is another.\nMegan Quinn is a writer at YourTango who covers entertainment and news, self, love, and relationships.",

    "text": "DECATUR, Ga. — Agnes Scott College has secured a substantial boost for its healthcare education initiatives, receiving $1 million in federal funding to help train physician assistants and mental health counselors. This funding comes as part of the 2024 omnibus appropriations bill, signed into law by President Biden on March 23. “This legislation makes strong investments that will lower childcare costs, support small businesses, strengthen rural health care and more,” said Senator Warnock, speaking about the Appropriations Act. “I’m proud it reflects my commitment to serving Georgians from Rome to Valdosta.” With this support, Agnes Scott College aims to prepare more than 160 master's students annually for careers as licensed professional counselors and certified physician assistants by 2027. \"We are immensely grateful to Senators Ossoff and Warnock for their support of our work to educate healthcare professionals, especially those who can make a difference in the lives of women and children,\" said Leocadia I. Zak, president of Agnes Scott College. The grant is specifically allocated to improve equipment, curriculum development, and technological resources required for the college's physician assistant and clinical mental health counseling graduate programs. The College introduced a clinical mental health counseling program in 2022 and plans to establish a physician assistant program in 2025.",

    "text": "Swift action was taken by the Provincial Consortium of Firefighters, who promptly rescued three hikers from the Puig Campana mountain on Friday June 21. Firefighters were initially called upon to rescue two girls in their twenties when they became lost while hiking in the mountain. Less than an hour later, a further report was received from a man in his forties who had become disorientated while disembarking the summit. The first warning was received at 1.43pm, and the Provincial Consortium helicopter, operating with remarkable efficiency, was despatched. It successfully reached the two girls and pulled them to safety via a triangle and a sling. The helicopter, heading to San Vincente del Raspeig fire station, was then called into action again when a second alert was received at 2.50pm. In order to provide assistance as quickly as possible, the aircraft turned around and landed at the heliport in Finestrat, leaving the rescued girls in the care of the Guardia Civil. It then returned to Puig Campana – the highest mountain in Benidorm – successfully locating and rescuing the German man. He was taken to Coll del Pouet where his wife was waiting for him. Fortunately, all three hikers emerged from the ordeal unscathed, a testament to the swift and effective response of the emergency services. Thank you for taking the time to read this article.

    "title": "Imtiaz Ali says he was ‘moved’ when he read Rig Veda and Bhagavad Gita as a child: ‘I understand people better’",
    "text": "Imtiaz Ali calls holy texts &#039;interesting and entertaining&#039;. ‘I was very moved’ Imtiaz reveals that he was reading a book which had the hymn of creation from Rig Veda right in the beginning and he was moved by it. “I couldn’t move past it; I understood what it meant. Bhagavad Gita has also been an important book in my life, it’s still that book I keep on my table. In sixth grade, I was travelling alone by train and money was tight. And ironically it was the only book I could afford to buy at the railway station. I also thought people around me would find it weird and wonder why I was reading it,” he said. ‘I’m after the simplicity of expression’ Imtiaz also shared that when he started reading Bhagavad Gita, he was surprised by how easy it was to understand. “There were a few things I had to re-read ten times to understand, but I understood it. I would read a few pages every day. It’s now deep within me; I&#039;m lucky I was exposed at such a young age. It has helped me understand people better. I’ve read other religious texts too. They’re interesting and entertaining, if I find a nugget that resonates with me, it makes my day,” he said. Recent work Imtiaz recently directed Amar Singh Chamkila, which starred Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra in the lead roles. The film, which was released on Netflix, is a biographical drama based on the life of the Punjabi singer. It charts the rise to fame and assassination of the titular performer and his wife, Amarjot Kaur. The film received good reviews from fans and critics.

    "title": "Saint-Jory. Les générations réunies pour célébrer Noël en musique - ladepeche.fr",
    "text": "Le dimanche 17 décembre, l’Église de Saint-Jory vibrait aux notes amples et chaleureuses des chants de Noël de l’ensemble Vocal Colors. En guise de trait d’union entre l’ancienne chargée de culture et la nouvelle équipe, Victor Denouvion accompagné de Marie-Ange Chemin, conseillère déléguée, a tenu à remercier Martine Agasse et Sophie Meulet pour l’organisation de ce magnifique événement offert aux Saint-Joryens par la municipalité. Dès 15 h 45, on observait une affluence régulière, à 16 h 30, face à une Église comble, les retardataires n’avaient d’autres choix que de s’amasser au fond, debout.\nL’évènement a rassemblé un large public de plusieurs générations. De jeunes parents, misant sur la magie des chants pour captiver les enfants les plus remuants, avaient fait le déplacement ; confiance qui n’a pas été démentie. Chants et musiques ont embarqué petits et grands. Kathy Boyé a bien vite tissé son lien avec le public et très vite, les paroles anglaises n’étaient plus une difficulté pour personne, toutes et tous fredonnaient, exhortés par la dynamique Kathy.\nEnraciné dans la culture noire américaine, les premières traces du Gospel étaient les chants a cappella des esclaves dans les champs de coton. C’est au XVIIIe siècle, avec le chant des prières et des sermons que se développe la tradition du Negro-Spiritual, expression de foi et d’espérance malgré les épreuves et les souffrances, porté par une structure musicale simple et des refrains répétitifs. Après l’abolition de l’esclavage aux États-Unis en 1865, des ensembles vocaux ont enrichi le style musical caractérisé avec des harmonies vocales complexes et une expressivité émotionnelle intense. Aujourd’hui encore, le style du Gospel s’enrichit des influences de blues et de jazz donnant naissance à une musique riche et profonde interpellant les émotions.\nLe public, entraîné par la ferveur transmise par les chœurs et les solistes, s’est levé comme pour rendre palpable sa communion avec l’espoir porté par les chants en ces périodes de fêtes. La foule était animée par l’envie de vivre l’intensité du moment.\nPlus tard, après des envolées lyriques superbes, ce sont les bras qui s’élevaient en rythme et formaient une ondulation parfaite pour accompagner l’allégresse des chants.\nKathy Boye, dont l’association Eureka Live est axée sur le chant, la musique, la sonothérapie, l’harmonie et le bien-être par les sons, a présenté avec son ensemble de Gospel Vocal Colors, bien plus qu’un spectacle réjouissant. Elle a offert à la salle comble une séance de bien être. La musique et les chants peuvent, en effet, agir comme un puissant antidote au stress, la participation active aux chants, avec des mouvements des bras du corps, des fredonnements ont des bienfaits reconnus sur l’humeur. Si les Saint-Joryens étaient venus chercher un simple et beau concert de Noël, ils sont ressortis radieux, détendus, portant en eux les promesses de belles fêtes mais aussi emplis de l’énergie de cette musique positive. Le final réjouissant de Happy Days, scandé à l’unisson par les battements de mains des spectateurs, a clôturé le concert dans une ambiance de joie irrésistible et communicative, laissant à chacun le sourire aux lèvres et une petite phrase d’Oscar Wilde à l’esprit : \"La musique met l’âme en harmonie avec tout ce qui existe\".",

    "text": "Pamela Villanueva, conductora de Telediario Mediodía, se desmayó en plena transmisión en vivo este 28 de diciembre del presente año. El video sucedió en vivo, cuando la comunicadora sufrió una descompensación, se balanceó y cayó al piso de manera inmediata.\nAunque al principio el público creyó que era una broma por el Día de los Inocentes, los comunicadores Erik Solheim y Sandra González expresaron que fue verdad y que Pamela Villanueva fue atendida por el equipo médico de manera inmediata.\n“Es importante mencionar antes de la pausa nuestra compañera se sintió un poco mal, pero afortunadamente se dio la intervención de los paramédicos de canal, se encuentra bien. Se encuentra bien, por recomendación médica regresará al aire el día de mañana, es deber de nosotros actualizar su estado de salud, pues todos nos asustamos cuando ocurrió”, dijo Erik Solheim.\n“Tuvimos una situación de emergencia, estamos completamente en vivo, estas cosas pueden pasar, está siendo atendida, gracias a la gente que ha estado preguntando por ella”, señaló Sandra González.\nQuerida presentadora sufre desmayo en vivo por no desayunar bien (Instagram)\nPamela Villanueva actualiza su estado de salud Horas después, Pamela Villanueva se enlazó a Telediario y actualizó su estado de salud. La comunicadora adelantó que regresara al trabajo el día de mañana, además de que agradeció por recibir la ayuda adecuada y expresar que se hará estudios de sangre para descartar o prevenir enfermedades.\n“No fue una broma, me desvanecí, por fortuna no pasó a mayores, no hubo un desmayo como tal, me brindaron de inmediato la atención el doctor y paramédicos de Multimedios. Me haré unos análisis, estoy bien de salud, gracias por los que se preocuparon, mañana nos reincorporamos a trabajar, fue una descompensación”, añadió.\nPamela expresó que no desayunó correctamente en la mañana, cosa que habría provocado su desmayo. Además, Villanueva agradeció al camarógrafo Juan Diego por dejar sus aparatos a un lado y cacharla, pues evitó que el golpe fuera mucho mayor: “Gracias al staff por su reacción, Juan Dios evitó que no me fuera a golpear la cabeza, no pasó a mayores y estoy bien”.",
