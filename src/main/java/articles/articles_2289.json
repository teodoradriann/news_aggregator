    "text": "This method works. How exactly should you drink water for weight loss\nMaintaining a normal weight is a common goal for many people, and one of the most effective strategies that is often overlooked is proper hydration. Water is not only essential for life, but also plays a crucial role in weight control and overall health.\nWhy should you drink water to lose weight\nThe benefits of drinking water are numerous and very diverse, including the following:\nFeeling full\nDrinking water before meals can help reduce appetite. One study found that people who drink a glass of water before meals tend to consume fewer calories during meals.\nMetabolism\nProper hydration can temporarily boost your metabolism. Some studies show that drinking cold water can make your body burn more calories by heating the liquid to body temperature.\nSubstitute for high-calorie drinks\nReplacing sugary or high-calorie drinks with water can significantly reduce your daily calorie intake, contributing to weight loss.\nImproved physical fitness\nStaying well-hydrated is essential for optimal performance during exercise. This means you'll be able to work out harder and for longer, which will help you burn more calories.\nHow exactly to drink water and lose weight\nSet daily goals\nA good goal is to drink at least 8 glasses (about 2 liters) of water a day. You can adjust this amount according to your individual needs, activity level, and climate.\nCarry the bottle with you\nHaving a reusable water bottle on hand will remind you to drink regularly. You can set a reminder on your phone if you need to.\nAdd flavor\nIf you find it difficult to drink enough water, try adding slices of fruit (such as lemon, cucumbers, or strawberries) or herbs (such as mint) to add flavor without adding significant calories.\nDrink before every meal\nMake it a habit to drink a glass of water before every meal. Not only will this help you feel full, but it will also remind you to stay hydrated on a regular basis. The simple act of staying hydrated can have a significant impact on weight management and overall health.\nRead also about two exercises that will help you lose weight.\nSources: Health, Eat This, not That, Marca.\nThis material is for informational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis or self-treatment.

    "text": "Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to give his unfiltered take on how fellow members of the GOP are all talk and no meaningful action when it comes to passing meaningful legislation to secure the U.S. Southern border. “The Republican Party is empty. It is completely empty. It is bankrupt. And I sit there listening to the guys offering these excuses. Right? Excuse after excuse. We don’t have enough votes in the House. We don’t have the Senate. We don’t have the White House. And we deliver nothing. And meanwhile, our country is getting absolutely destroyed with wide open borders. I was in South Texas, in Brackettville, Texas yesterday with about 200 ranchers and law enforcement, local leaders, local political leaders and sheriffs. And they’re beside themselves. They’re looking at someone like me and others that have stood up and tried to fight, defend the border. And they’re saying, what are we going to do now? Do you know what their questions are? Their questions are what do I do to protect my family? What am I allowed to do when I have people pouring across my ranch and breaking into my home? And Joe Biden scoffs and the MSNBC Leftist go, Chip Roy, he’s a crazy madman because he’s saying that the Texas should ignore the Supreme Court’s ridiculous ruling. Look, we are at a new era now, and it is time for us to take our freedom back. It’s not taking our country back. It’s about taking our ability to live free. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of these gutless cowards in Washington.” Rep. Roy also shares his message to the Republican Party ahead of the critical 2024 presidential election. “The Marxist Democrats that are running our country right now, they want to kill it and destroy it. They want a one world order. They want wide open borders. They don’t believe in sovereignty. They don’t believe in capitalism. They don’t believe in the freedom of our fathers. They don’t believe in Western civilization. Republicans say they do, and they don’t do a damn thing about it. Republicans never show up to the fight, they never show up with even a quarter of the energy the Democrats exert to kill our country. Republicans don’t show up and match that. And that’s what I’m asking. And that’s frankly what I’m trying to push on President Trump and on Republicans. We headed to this election season. Do we mean it? Are we going to do something this time? Are we going to stand up, secure the border? Are we going to stand up for freedom? Governor Abbott’s down there just trying to put razor wire up. He’s having to go to court, and he’s having to fight to keep the National Guard, to be able to hold razor wire up, which isn’t even securing the border. It’s literally just moving traffic around. And we can’t even do that. Like that’s how bad it’s got. And you know, I just it’s beside me that we can sit back and think that this is somehow good for humanity around the world. Because we’re empowering our enemies. We’re empowering China. We’re undoing our ability to produce wealth through our own American energy. And we’re empowering China to pollute with massive coal fired plants while we dismantle our free market engine by mandating electric vehicles that are piling up on automobile dealership lines. A story for a different day, but it’s all connected. Republicans have got to show up to the fight.” Listen to the podcast to hear what else he had to say to Jimmy!

    "text": "Stanley responded Wednesday to concerns by customers that its popular drinking cup contains lead, TODAY.com reported.\nThe company confirmed that Stanley cups are manufactured using lead, but added that no threat is posed unless the cup is damaged in a manner that exposes the lead, a company spokesperson informed TODAY.com via a statement.\nDo Stanley cups contain lead or pose a risk of lead poisoning? Experts weigh in https://t.co/Buz0Vf3rv0\n— NBC News Health (@NBCNewsHealth) January 25, 2024\nEach Stanley quencher has a circular barrier made of stainless steel on the bottom of the cup covering a pellet that has lead inside it, the Stanley spokesperson’s statement detailed, according to the outlet. The pellet is inaccessible unless the stainless-steel barrier is removed from the cup, which is a “rare” occurrence, the statement reportedly read.\n“Our engineering and supply chain teams are making progress on innovative, alternative materials for use in the sealing process,” the spokesperson said, the outlet reported.\nStanley cups have surged in popularity since the brand released a limited-edition pink version of the 40-ounce Stanley “Quencher” drinking cup, which was made in a partnership with Starbucks, according to NBC News. The $49.95 cups are reportedly sold exclusively at Starbucks locations inside Target stores. (RELATED: Woman Arrested For Allegedly Stealing 65 Stanley Cups)\nChaos ensued in stores as people attempted to get ahold of their own Stanley cup upon its release, according to the outlet. Viral videos show customers waiting in long lines and getting into fights. One man even jumped over a counter.\nThe Stanley spokesperson mentioned the company’s lifetime warranty for the popular product, which can be used in the circumstance that the pellet containing lead is exposed, TODAY.com reported. Liquid inside of the beverage container could not possibly come into contact with the pellet, experts said, according to the outlet.",
