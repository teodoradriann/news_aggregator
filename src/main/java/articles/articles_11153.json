    "text": "Current and former members of the\n[Digital Applied Learning and Innovation Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth have been showcasing their work at recent events.\nSeveral Dartmouth students and DALI alums who founded companies were among the most recent cohort accepted into Y Combinator, a well-known startup accelerator based in Silicon Valley.\n“DALI is a student-driven curiosity lab. We design and build technology solutions for a diverse array of problems for partners from around the world,” says DALI Director Tim Tregubov, a senior lecturer in the\n[Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/).\nAnd among the 56 demos at the Fall ’24 Technigala, held on Nov. 19 at the Class of ’82 Engineering and Computer Science Center, was a project with Benchify—one of the five startups that was accepted into this summer’s three-month Y Combinator program.\nThe DALI lab hosts Technigala, a showcase of final computer science class projects and initiatives that students are working on with partners, at the end of every term. The event is sponsored by the computer science department, the\n[Digital Arts Program](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/digital-arts-minor-0), and DALI Lab as part of the [Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship](https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/).\nCo-founded by Juan Castaño ’19 and Max von Hippel, Benchify automates software testing processes to write bug-free code, fast.\n“The idea was to create a really easy-to-use software testing product. What makes us different is that we’re using techniques typically used in academia in aerospace and chip design,” says Castaño, who worked on DALI projects all four years of his Dartmouth career.\nEntry into the Y Combinator program is extremely competitive, with an average acceptance rate of less than 3%. Successful applicants receive $500,000 in funding and access to professional networks and mentorship to help the startup take off. Notable program alumni include Dropbox, DoorDash, AirBnB, and Reddit.\nAlong with Benchify, this year’s summer batch with DALI ties included:\n- Lumenary, an AI-powered tool to accelerate financial research, founded by Vivek Hazari ’22, Daniel DiPietro ’22, Ziray Hao ’22, and John McCambridge ’23\n- Pumpkin, an AI web browser built by Sam Crombie ’23\n- CodeViz, an AI agent that creates a visual interface for code, founded by Liam Prevelige ’23 and Will McCall ’23\n- And deepsilicon, a company founded by computer science and engineering major Abhinav Reddy ’27 and Alexander Nanda ’27, who is studying computer science and physics. They are focused on creating simple software and hardware to run neural networks faster and cheaper.\nReddy, who worked as a software engineer for a year before starting at Dartmouth, says that DALI does a great job in replicating how teams operate in the corporate setting. “DALI sets up students for the company work environment, you basically know everything you need to know when you join. The onboarding process is very smooth,” he says.\nBenchify is currently working with a DALI team to expand their tool and add new features for a more streamlined debugging process. “I loved working at DALI, I know how it works, and I was excited by the chance to partner with them,” says Castaño.\nLearning by building\nThe DALI Lab recruits students to work in small teams as developers and designers to build digital solutions to complex, real-world problems. Designed as a startup-like experiential learning program, DALI was co-founded by\n[Daniel Rockmore](http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/daniel-rockmore), the William H. Neukom 1964 Distinguished Professor of Computational Science, [Lorie Loeb](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/lorie-loeb), research professor of computer science, and Tregubov.\nIt’s common for students to work on one or more projects over many terms, even years, Tregubov says, making the experience different from a class project or capstone course. “By the time a DALI student graduates, they have designed, built, and shipped several projects/products of significant scope,” he says.\nRecent examples include a virtual reality app called\n[ Veridium](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2023/04/chemistry-students-take-virtual-dive-materials) that brings chemistry lessons to life in the classroom and a [ smart microscope](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2023/05/geisel-professor-gives-microscopes-digital-makeover) created in partnership with Dartmouth Health dermatopathologist [Aravindhan Sriharan](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=6790) that allows clinicians to diagnose disorders from digital images.\nSriharan and the DALI team showcased the latest version of the SmartScope at the fall Technigala alongside newer projects such as Greta 2.0 and DeanHub.\nGreta 2.0 was designed as a real world replica of the AI sibling in Matthew Libby’s play\n[ Sisters](https://faculty.dartmouth.edu/artsandsciences/news/2024/09/shining-spotlight-humanity-digital-era), performed at the Northern Stage in White River Junction in late September, that explored the relations between humans and technology.\nCreated by a team of students and staff members from the DALI Lab, the chatbot interacted with theatergoers offstage.\n“The idea was to deepen people’s connection with the play. It was very interesting to see the questions that users asked and the quirky responses Greta 2.0 gave,” said the team’s product manager Richa Ranjan, Thayer ’25.\nDeanHub, an application being developed for Dartmouth Information, Technology & Consulting, pulls together student course information for deans on an easy to visualize platform.\nProjects using augmented reality and virtual reality developed as part of a computer science course were a major draw. Event visitors tried out a variety of VR apps—one created dynamic 3D art based on word prompts they chose while another let users explore a dark labyrinth that sprung jump scares and other spooky surprises as they moved around.\nTransforming ideas into impact\nAway from the crowded atrium at Technigala, a small group gathered in a conference room inside the DALI lab.\n[ Rolando Coto Solano](https://linguistics.dartmouth.edu/people/rolando-coto-solano), assistant professor of linguistics and adjunct assistant professor of computer science, met with the first cohort of students selected for the [ E.E. Just DALI Internship](https://students.dartmouth.edu/eejust/undergraduate/fellowships-internships/ee-just-dali-internship).\nDuring the two-year program, students will gain hands-on experience working at the interface of technology and design on projects that will positively impact underrepresented and marginalized communities.\nCoto Solano uses machine language technology to build automatic speech recognition tools for Indigenous languages such as Cook Islands Māori. These tools can help transcribe large volumes of video recordings that chronicle stories and cultures of these communities to create educational materials and help keep these languages alive.\n“I need all the help I can get to develop better interface design for these tools and make them more effective,” says Coto Solano. Through this program, students will develop technical skills while working to build tools that are going to be impactful to people on the ground, he says.\nThis spirit of taking an idea, working it through, and finding impact is central to DALI’s mission, says Tregubov.\nEvidently excited to see so many familiar names in the Y Combinator roster this year, their success underscores the experience they gain as undergraduates at Dartmouth and DALI, he says.\n“Dartmouth Computer Science and DALI now have students who are starting up their own thing to try to change the world,” says Tregubov. “It’s awesome.”",

    "text": "Read more about how we evaluate products.\nOur favorite smart electric toothbrush is $70 off right now\nThat matches the lowest price yet on the Oral-B iO Series 7.\nThe\nOral-B iO Series 7 smart electric toothbrush is down to $149 at Amazon after a $71 discount. That matches the best price we've seen and returns it to the low it hit for the shopping holidays last year. The deal comes as part of a larger sale in which Oral-B toothbrushes are up to 55 percent off. We named the iO Series 7 the top pick in our guide to smart toothbrushes because it hits a good balance between features and affordability (particularly if you can catch it on sale like right now).\nOur top pick from our smart toothbrush guide is currently 32 percent off at Amazon.\n$149 at Amazon\nWe tested a handful of smart electric toothbrushes (in this case \"smart\" means app-connected) and ultimately liked this one best. It has a black and white LED screen that tells you helpful info like mode, battery life and how long is left on your two minute timer. The vibrating head is vigorous but not lip-numbing like other models we tried and the lighted ring helpfully indicates whether you're pushing too hard or not quite firmly enough.\nIf you want to brush while looking at your phone, you can watch an animated recreation of a set of teeth that slowly turns from blue to white as the internal sensors track the position and movement of your brush. It's a bit of a surreal experience, but I did notice my teeth felt cleaner after using this than they do with a standard brush.\nThis set comes with a replacement head, travel case and charging dock which you should only need to use a couple times per month. If you want something even fancier, the\nOral-B iO Series 9 is also on sale. The Series numbering refers to the level of features, not the newness of the brush, so Series 9 has extra brush modes, a color LED screen and a charging travel case — all of which the Series 7 lacks. Though in my tests, I didn't find those perks were worth an additional $100.\nFollow\n@EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

    "text": "Los episodios meteorológicos de París ponen en jaque algunas competiciones de los JJ.OO\nParís en verano suele ser conocido por su clima cálido y relativamente seco, aunque no es raro que ocurran tormentas esporádicas.\nRedacción\nUna fuerte lluvia empapó París, Francia, la pasada tarde del jueves 1 de agosto, mientras que las condiciones tormentosas trajeron viento, relámpagos y aguaceros a la región.\nEstas imágenes fueron filmadas y publicadas por el usuario de X @Groovision. El hombre las filmó desde su casa en el distrito 16 de la ciudad el jueves por la noche.\nEl jueves por la tarde, los relámpagos y la lluvia interrumpieron varios juegos olímpicos en la capital. Como consecuencia, se tuvo que retrasar el partido de baloncesto masculino entre Francia y Serbia, y posponiendo el partido entre EE. UU. y Letonia más tarde esa noche, tal y como informó el reconocido periódico Le Parisien.\nEste no ha sido el único fallo meteorológico que ha condicionado la celebración de algunas cateogrías olímpicas.\nEn días anteriores, las fuertes lluvias en París degradaron la calidad del agua en el Sena, frustrando los planes para que los eventos de natación olímpica de 2024 se llevaran a cabo en el río, según informes locales.\nLa organización de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 se enfrenta a desafíos imprevistos, ya que las condiciones meteorológicas han impactado la planificación y ejecución de varios eventos deportivos.\nEl clima de París en verano: ¿problema o desventaja?\nParís en verano suele ser conocido por su clima cálido y relativamente seco, aunque no es raro que ocurran tormentas esporádicas. La ciudad experimenta una temperatura media en agosto de aproximadamente 25ºC, con lluvias ocasionales que suelen ser breves.\nSin embargo, las tormentas recientes han sido particularmente intensas, afectando no solo a los ciudadanos sino también a la infraestructura y eventos planeados.\nLos Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 representan una oportunidad monumental para la ciudad, destacando su capacidad para albergar eventos deportivos de clase mundial. No obstante, el cambio climático y las variaciones extremas del clima presentan nuevos desafíos para los organizadores.\nLa decisión de realizar eventos de natación en el Sena, por ejemplo, es innovadora y simbólica. Sin embargo, depende en gran medida de la calidad del agua, que puede verse afectada por lluvias intensas y contaminantes arrastrados por las corrientes.\nLos organizadores están trabajando arduamente para asegurar que todos los eventos se lleven a cabo de manera segura y exitosa. Para ello se han adaptado a las condiciones cambiantes, garantizando que París 2024 sea recordado como unos Juegos Olímpicos memorables y bien gestionados.",

    "text": "Tony Blair was advised to work with militants in Kosovo, some of whom have subsequently been put on trial for war crimes, despite reportedly believing they were “not much better than the Serbs” whose own crimes against humanity he was seeking to end, it has been revealed.\nBlair, then the UK prime minister, had grave concerns about being seen to be too close to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which was fighting against the Serbian nationalist forces led by Slobodan Milošević.\nBut he was advised: “Overall, our starting point in a conflict like this should be that your enemy’s enemy is your friend.”\nIn a paper prepared by John Sawers, then Blair’s foreign affairs adviser and later the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, the former prime minister was told: “We’re in danger of being too sniffy. We do not want to favour the KLA politically over other Kosovar parties.\n“But we have to reckon on the KLA becoming vastly more popular after what has happened [in the Yugoslav wars], and recognise that they are the only party with an army of sorts.”\nWar crimes tribunal centres on how much former Kosovan president knew\nRead more In the paper, sent to Blair and his senior aides, Sawers suggested it would be impossible to disarm the KLA after the conflict. Instead, he advised, it would be better to work with the organisation to bring about elections.\nAt the bottom of the paper, released to the National Archives by the Cabinet Office on Friday, an unsigned hand has written: “I agree.”\nThe note makes clear the angst within No 10 about the nature and extent of the UK’s involvement in the brutal multi-factional conflict that raged in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001.\nNato interventions included airstrikes against the forces of Milošević, who died in 2006 while being tried for war crimes.\nThe UK, under Blair’s leadership, would subsequently become one of the principal backers of the KLA under its then leader Hashim Thaçi.\nIn April this year, the latter appeared in the dock of a court in The Hague – alongside three prominent colleagues – accused of war crimes that include alleged complicity in the murders of 102 people.\nA spokesman for Blair declined to comment.\nExplore more on these topics Tony Blair National Archives Kosovo Serbia Bosnia and Herzegovina news\nReuse this content",

    "text": "Republicans say they will not give more money to an administration they cannot trust to enforce immigration laws. Instead they are trying to impeach the secretary of homeland security. Democrats look at Republican demands, such as that families coming into the country can be detained indefinitely, and conclude that negotiations are being set up to fail and are therefore really a weapon against Mr Biden. The odds are that both parties will choose campaigning over dealmaking. That should worry Mr Biden. Our reporting from the Mexican side of the border suggests that, if people believe Mr Trump will win, many more will try to cross into America before he is inaugurated. Insecure borders weaken support for legal immigration and boost restrictionist parties. Immigration could bring Mr Trump back to the White House, from where he might pull America out of the refugee convention of 1951, causing it to collapse. Mr Biden should call the Republicans’ bluff, roll up his sleeves and set out to fix the border. That would be the right thing to do. It would also help his prospects. [He’s had three years to do it and still hasn’t acted. It’s not a question of priorities, but a question of policy. His policy is to keep the border as wide open as possible. Americans have had enough of it, especially in northern cities where immigrants are coming by the thousands for “sanctuary.” — Ed]",

    "text": "By Donald Ramotar, former President of Guyana\nTHE year 2023 was, by all accounts, a very eventful one. While we see great prospects for the future advancement of humankind, at the same time the challenges and dangers have been great, often threatening our own destruction.\nIt is unfortunate that many important countries in the world, mainly in the West, are adapting positions that create conditions for conflicts and more conflicts.\nThe very few proposals and efforts are being pushed by other countries, especially the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\nIt is in an atmosphere of real danger to humankind that President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China made some groundbreaking proposals. When taken together, these proposals can lead the international community on a road of stability and peace. They are the “Global Development Initiative” (GDI), the “Global Security Initiative” (GSI) and the “Global Civilization Initiative” (GCI).\nThe initiatives have captured the imagination of the world generally and more particularly they took into consideration the specific circumstances of each country. This is brought out strongly in the GCI.\nPresident Xi was able to show the interconnections between world peace, socio-economic development, and national security.\nDuring this year as well, the PRC was heavily involved in making efforts at the diplomatic level to resolve many of the very serious and knotty problems in our time.\nRecall that early in the year President Xi proposed a twelve-point measure to resolve the conflict in which Russia and Ukraine have been caught. President Putin welcomed the proposals as a good basis for dialogue with Ukraine and the West. Those measures captured some very important aspects of the conflict and principles that could be applied generally in their resolution. These included territorial integrity; mutual security in which no country should seek greater security at the expense of another; no use of nuclear weapons, indeed President Xi insisted on the principle that nuclear weapons should never be used, and a nuclear war never fought. Unfortunately, the US and its NATO allies have not yet taken up this sound proposal. However, as the war in Ukraine drags on, we are beginning to witness some realism on the part of the Western powers. President Xi’s proposal is a good basis to begin talks.\nThe most burning issue in the international arena at present is the devastation of Gaza and the slaughter of the people there, including a large amount of children and babies. Here too the Chinese government has made very sound proposals to end the attacks of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine.\nAt the Security Council of the United Nations, the PRC called for an immediate cease fire as the indispensable step towards resolving the tragic killings in Gaza. As a permanent settlement of the conflict, the proposal of a two-state solution was emphasized. A viable Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.\nUnfortunately, the United States used its veto powers at the Security Council and General Assembly of the UN to allow Israel to continue its carpet bombing of the Gaza. In addition, they have supplied Israel with the most sophisticated weapons to use against the Palestinians.\nIn recent times we have observed that more and more states have been adopting the call for a cease fire and a two-state solution. Millions on the streets are calling for this, thus we are optimistic that a permanent solution in line with China’s proposal is emerging.\nThe Chinese government has been working tirelessly to ease the tension in the Middle East. This area is one of the most dangerous in our world.\nIts endeavours have met with much success. The most notable was its mediation which led Iran and Saudia Arabia to resume diplomatic relations. Already the two countries have assigned ambassadors to the capitals of each other countries. This would bring great benefits to the people of those two countries and to the region as a whole. The role of the PRC has been welcomed and lauded.\nFinally, the Chinese administration has displayed remarkable restraint in the face of provocation by the United States in relation to its internal affairs, on the “Taiwan” issue.\nChina continues to work for the re-unification of Taiwan with the mainland in a peaceful manner. It encourages dialogue and has long ago made one of the most creative proposals that is “One Country, Two Systems”. That has proven to be a viable path.\nThe world is a much safer place because of the work that President Xi Jinping and the Government of China have been pursuing over the years and particularly in 2023. We are certain that 2024 would bring greater successes.",
