    "title": "A Texas school's punishment of a Black student who wears his hair in locs is going to trial, ET Education",
    "text": "His Houston-area school district, Barbers Hill, has said George's long hair, which he wears in neatly tied and twisted locs on top of his head, violates a district dress code that limits hair length for boys. The district has said other students with locs comply with the length policy.ANAHUAC, Texas - A judge ordered Wednesday that a trial be held next month to determine whether a Black high school student in Texas can continue being punished by his district for refusing to change a hairstyle he and his family say is protected by a new state law. Darryl George, 18, has not been in his regular classroom in Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu since Aug. 31. Instead, he has either been serving in-school suspension or spending time in an off-site disciplinary program. His Houston-area school district, Barbers Hill, has said George's long hair, which he wears in neatly tied and twisted locs on top of his head, violates a district dress code that limits hair length for boys. The district has said other students with locs comply with the length policy. George, a junior, said Wednesday that he has felt stress and frustration over what he sees as unfair punishment, but that he was grateful to soon be getting his day in court. \\\"I'm glad that we are being heard, too. I'm glad that things are moving and we're getting through this,\\\" George said after the hearing in Anahuac, with his mother, Darresha George, standing next to him. State District Judge Chap Cain III in Anahuac set a Feb. 22 trial in a lawsuit filed by the school district regarding whether its dress code restrictions limiting the length of boys' hair violates the CROWN Act. The new Texas law, which took effect in September, prohibits race-based hair discrimination and bars employers and schools from penalizing people because of hair texture or protective hairstyles including Afros, braids, locs, twists or Bantu knots. Darresha George said she was disappointed the judge did not consider granting a temporary restraining order, which would have halted her son's punishment until next month's trial. \\\"I have a son, 18 years old, that wants to go to school, that wants to get his education, and y'all messing with him. Why?\\\" she said. In an affidavit filed last week in support of the temporary restraining order, Darryl George said he is being subjected to \\\"cruel treatment.\\\" \\\"I love my hair, it is sacred and it is my strength,\\\" George wrote. \\\"All I want to do is go to school and be a model student. I am being harassed by school officials and treated like a dog.\\\" A spokesperson for the school district didn't speak with reporters after the hearing and didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comment. In a paid ad that ran this month in the Houston Chronicle, Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole maintained the district is not violating the CROWN Act. In the ad, Poole defended his district's policy and wrote that districts with a traditional dress code are safer and had higher academic performance and that \\\"being an American requires conformity.\\\" \\\"We will not lose sight of the main goal - high standards for our students - by bending to political pressure or responding to misinformed media reports. These entities have 'lesser' goals that ultimately harm kids,\\\" Poole wrote. The two Texas lawmakers who co-wrote the state's version of the CROWN Act - state Reps. Rhetta Bowers and Ron Reynolds - attended Wednesday's hearing and said the new state law does protect Darryl George's hairstyle. The district \\\"is punishing Darryl George for one reason: his choice to wear his hair in a protective style which harms no one and causes no distraction in the classroom,\\\" Bowers said. George's family has also filed a formal complaint with the Texas Education Agency and a federal civil rights lawsuit against Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the school district, alleging they failed to enforce the CROWN Act. The lawsuit is before a federal judge in Galveston, Texas. Barbers Hill's policy on student hair was previously challenged in a May 2020 federal lawsuit filed by two other students. Both students withdrew from the high school, but one returned after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, saying the student showed \\\"a substantial likelihood\\\" that his rights to free speech and to be free from racial discrimination would be violated if not allowed to return to campus. That lawsuit remains pending. ___ Follow Juan A. Lozano: https://twitter.com/juanlozano70",

    "text": "- By [Prerna Targhotra](/authors/prerna-targhotra) - Published: Fri, 19 Jul 2024 03:11 PM (IST) - Source:JND Home Remedies For Oily Skin: Managing oily skin can be tough. Excess oil can cause clogged pores, acne, and a shiny appearance. Fortunately, our mother nature provides some great solutions that can help manage oily skin effectively. Dr HansaJi Yogendra – Director, of The Yoga Institute, listed five natural ingredients that can help balance oily skin. Incorporating these natural ingredients into your skincare routine can help manage oily skin effectively. While they offer many benefits, it’s essential to use them correctly and in moderation to avoid irritation. Always perform a patch test before trying to ensure they are suitable for your skin type. Home Remedies For Oily Skin Honey Honey is a natural humectant, wherein it draws moisture into your skin without making it oily. It has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce acne and soothe irritated skin. Honey’s gentle yet effective nature makes it suitable for balancing oily skin. Applying a thin layer of raw honey as a face mask for about 10-15 minutes before rinsing off with warm water can help control oil and keep your skin hydrated and clear.

Sadhguru Jaggi Explains](https://english.jagran.com/lifestyle/does-going-to-bed-with-full-stomach-cause-back-pain-sadhguru-jaggi-explains-10174478) Cucumber Cucumber is known for its cooling and astringent properties, making it a great choice for oily skin. It contains a high water content and essential vitamins and minerals that help soothe and hydrate your skin while reducing excess oil. Cucumbers can also tighten pores and reduce the appearance of shine. Applying cucumber juice or using cucumber slices directly on your skin can help to freshen and balance oily skin. Apple Cider Vinegar Home Remedies For Oily Skin (Image Credits: Canva) Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular natural remedy for oily skin due to its astringent properties. It helps to balance the skin’s pH levels and reduce excess oil production. ACV also has antibacterial properties that can help prevent acne. To use ACV, mix one part vinegar with three parts water and apply it to your skin with a cotton ball. Allow it to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off with cold water. It’s important to dilute ACV properly to avoid irritation. Lemon Juice Lemon juice is rich in citric acid, which acts as a natural astringent and helps to control oil production. It also has antibacterial properties that can help combat acne-causing bacteria. The vitamin C in lemon juice brightens your skin and reduces the appearance of scars and blemishes. However, lemon juice can be very potent, so it’s best to dilute it with water and use it sparingly. Apply the diluted lemon juice to your skin, leave it on for about 5-10 minutes, and then rinse off thoroughly. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is a versatile plant known for its soothing and hydrating properties. It contains natural salicylic acid and enzymes that can help exfoliate your skin, removing excess oil and dead skin cells that clog pores. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help calm irritated skin and reduce redness associated with acne. Its light, gel-like texture makes it an excellent moisturiser for oily skin. Applying fresh aloe vera gel directly from the plant or using products containing a high percentage of aloe vera can yield beneficial results.

    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News LOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone. Despite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three. Olivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs. In the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough. “It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.” The nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, [New York](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/press/2024/fy25-enacted-budget-transit-expansion-and-roadway-safety.html) and [Michigan](https://gophouse.org/posts/rep-slaghs-plan-improving-method-for-setting-speed-limits-is-now-state-law) passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved [a measure](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-03-05/2024-california-election-los-angeles-city-measure-hla-results) that forces the city to act on its own [safety improvement plan](https://planning.lacity.gov/odocument/523f2a95-9d72-41d7-aba5-1972f84c1d36/Mobility_Plan_2035.pdf), mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians. Still, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down [his bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB961) to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph. Although the Biden administration is championing [Vision Zero](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/zero-deaths) — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf), road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down. “We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of [Vision Zero Network,](https://visionzeronetwork.org/about/vision-zero-network/) a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country. Still a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. [In 2022](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813560#page=XX), more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades. Experts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, [thus deadlier](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians) when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have [gradually increased](https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/transportation-review-speeding-and-speed-limits#:~:text=A%20few%20states%20have%20recently,for%20trucks%20to%2065%20mph). Early estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a [slight decrease](https://www.ghsa.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/Pedestrian%20Traffic%20Fatalities%20by%20State%2C%20January-June%202023%20Preliminary%20Data.pdf#page=4) from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above [pre-pandemic numbers](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813060#page=XX). “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg [wrote in February](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-02/2024%20NRSS%20Progress%20Report.pdf#=page3) of roadway deaths. The Biden administration has directed [$15.6 billion](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/federal-highway-administration-announces-more-funding-and-flexibility-key-highway-safety) to road safety until 2026 and [$5 billion](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/SS4A) in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ [vulnerable road user” rule](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/federal-highway-administration-announces-more-funding-and-flexibility-key-highway-safety#:~:text=Under%20the%20rule%2C%20if%20vulnerable%20road%20users%20make,that%20address%20the%20safety%20of%20these%20road%20users.), states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending. Road safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines [last year](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/19/2023-27178/national-standards-for-traffic-control-devices-the-manual-on-uniform-traffic-control-devices-for). The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians. But the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits. In response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan [passed legislation](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2023-HB-4012) granting local governments authority to [round down](https://www.abc12.com/news/state/michigan-communities-get-new-freedom-to-lower-speed-limits/article_3bf04532-f1bb-11ee-951c-3bd477607c5f.html) when setting speed limits. And after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas. “With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen. Push for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership. Automakers like BMW [questioned the effectiveness](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2023-05/Request-for-comment_Pedestrian-Crashworthiness-Protection_04-20-23_Web%20Version.pdf#=page51) of a program testing pedestrian protections in vehicles arguing that in European countries that adopted such a regulation, it’s not been clear whether it led to fewer deaths and injuries. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about [$49 million](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying?cycle=2024&ind=T2100) lobbying in 2023 compared with [$2.2 million](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/advocates-for-highway-auto-safety/lobbying?id=D000046441) spent by advocates for highway and auto safety. “The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker. Although Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced [companion legislation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB960) that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. When that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills. In Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed [Measure HLA](https://results.lavote.gov/#year=2024&election=4316), which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative. It’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond. Stories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver. “There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.
