    "title": "Centuries-old Masjid in Ganberbal crumbling, locals demand renovation - DailyExcelsior",
    "text": "Suhail Bhat SRINAGAR, Dec 28: A 17th-century Mughal-era Masjid in the Malshahi Bagh area of Ganderbal district is currently in a state of disrepair, prompting locals to call for its immediate renovation to safeguard this invaluable historical asset. Despite being designated as a protected monument in 2021 due to its cultural and historical significance, the Masjid has not seen improvements in its condition and continues to deteriorate. Known locally as the Jinn Masjid, it was built by Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shahjahan, for his spiritual mentor and saint Mullah Shah Badakhshi. However, the monument now requires urgent attention, having developed cracks over centuries of exposure to snow and rain. The lack of proper oversight has turned the Masjid into a haven for anti-social elements, as per locals, even though it falls under the care of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board. The locals alleged that the Muslim body has been unable to maintain this architectural gem, and the Masjid’s condition worsens day by day. “We urge the Government to preserve this culturally significant mosque,” Noor Mohammad, a local, said. [Click here to watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km6a845cByU) He said that the Masjid is located within a 360-kanal apple, plum, and walnut orchard, and while the Wakf gladly accepts returns from the orchard, it appears to be indifferent to the upkeep of this heritage site, “We have brought up the issue with the Wakf Board several times, but no action has been taken so far,” he said. Locals attribute the delayed renovation of the mosque to the laid-back attitude of the Waqf Board. “During our visit to the Waqf Board, they informed us that the Masjid is under the jurisdiction of another department. Although their officials visited the site and issued tenders for the renovation project, the Awqaf is still sitting on it,” a local said. The Chairperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board, Darakshan Andrabi, clarified that the Masjid has been declared a protected monument and falls under the purview of the Archaeological Survey of India. “We cannot undertake the renovation independently; otherwise, we would have already done so. While we are aware of the condition of the Masjid, we share the community’s desire for its preservation,” she said.",

    "text": "Neighbors across the Coastal Bend may have noticed some lingering smoke in the air following several fires on Tuesday in areas such as Sinton and on Padre Island.\nOn Wednesday, March 5, people recieved alerts on their phones saying \"unhealthy air quality for sensitive groups.\" The excess smoke from the fires can be dangerous for some neighbors in those sensitive groups.\nThe American Lung Association advises everyone to be extra cautious when it comes to inhaling smoke from fires, but especially those who are considered at-risk.\n“So, this is the orange level we see when we look at the air quality index. And those sensitive groups, again, are children and older adults, pregnant people, people with underlying respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, like asthma and COPD,\" JoAnna Strother, the Senior Director of Advocacy for the American Lung Association said. \"People with diabetes or heart issues, and definitely people with lung cancer.\"\nStrother recommended all neighbors stay indoors when the air quality index is marked unsafe. That applies especially to those in the at-risk category. She recommends wearing a KN95 facemask if you have to go outside during these times.\n\"Basically everyone is at-risk for breathing in wildfire smoke,\" Strother said. \"Even healthy adults can experience symptoms and are vulerable and susceptible to wildfire smoke,\" Strother said. \"Smoke from wildfires can even harm people who are not directly in the fire, certainly nearby, and even may miles down, as wildfire smoke travels.\"\nYou can click here to find out the Air Quality Index for your location at any time.\n\"After a wildfire, you should definitely avoid dust and soot, again, continuing to cover your face with an appropriate face mask. Then, individuals with lung issues should avoid cleanup acitivities,\" Strother said.\nFor the latest local news updates, click here, or download the KRIS 6 News App.\nCatch all the KRIS 6 News stories and more on our YouTube page.
