    "text": "BRUSSELS - Daily global sea ice cover dropped to an unprecedented low in early February, reflecting the ongoing warming of the planet, the EU-funded Copernicus Climate Change Service reported on Thursday.\nDaily global sea ice extent, which combines the sea ice extents in both polar regions, reached a new all-time minimum in early February and remained below the previous record of February 2023 for the rest of the month, the report said.\nThe Arctic sea ice extent was 8 percent below average, marking the third consecutive month of record-low extent for its respective month, while the Antarctic sea ice extent was 26 percent below average, the fourth-lowest on record for February.\nREAD MORE:\nStudy: Meltdown of West Antarctic Ice Sheet unavoidable\nThe report also said that February 2025 was the third-warmest February globally, with an average surface air temperature of 13.36 degrees Celsius.\nThe number was 1.59 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels, making February the 19th month out of the past 20 months in which the global average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, a critical threshold set by the\nParis Agreement.\nREAD MORE:\nEU climate agency: 2024 set to be warmest year on record\n\"One of the consequences of a warmer world is melting sea ice, and the record-low sea ice cover at both poles has pushed global sea ice extent to an all-time minimum,\" said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.",

Please call us at 207-778-2638 during our open hours to schedule an appointment.\nAura. SUBMITTED PHOTO\nAura is a one to three year old female black and white shorthair cat, with the nickname “She-hemoth.” Her energy level is medium and she likes some cats, but not all. It is not known how she reacts with dogs. She’s very friendly and flirty with people.\nMeet Aura: This playful little soul is ready to steal your heart. While she doesn’t particularly care for other cats, she is super loving and friendly with people. She loves to sleep on the floor, play with toys, and stare lovingly into your eyes. She likes to be really cute and pose for pictures. Come and meet this funny little lady and see if she hypnotizes you with her glowing green eyes.\nLola. SUBMITTED PHOTO\nLola is a female Pitbull mix of one to three years old. Her nicknames are “Showgirl,” and “Lottie.” With a medium energy level, Lola is nervous around people at first, but very sweet.\nMeet Miss Lola: She is a very sweet young lady once she gets to know you. She can be very wary of new people, and she can be a bit reactive in stressful situations. However, she is great for handling, and will ask for snuggles no matter what task is at hand.\nOnce she is comfortable, she is very affectionate and sweet. We recommend for Lola to go to a home with no other pets, and while she is not a risk to children, her nervousness and reactivity means she would be best in a home with kids who are 12 and older. Come meet this adorable snuggler who just needs a little extra time to become more comfortable.",
