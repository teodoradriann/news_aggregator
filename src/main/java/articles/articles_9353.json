The news ticker.\nUpdate from December 29, 14:43 p.m.: \"We have a very, very tense situation,\" said Lower Saxony's Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) on Deutschlandfunk. The flood situation remains critical. Almost all of Lower Saxony is under water. The approximately 100,000 personnel from the fire brigade and the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), among others, are therefore deployed everywhere.\nThere is \"really no easing in sight,\" added the SPD politician. According to the weather forecast, there will be more rain in the next few days, as well as storms. This does not ease the situation, but \"exacerbates it at one point or another\".\nContinuous rain could exacerbate flood situation Update from December 29, 12:20 p.m.: Thousands of emergency workers are still fighting against the floods in numerous regions in Germany, and the next water is already on the horizon. As the German Weather Service published on Friday, rain must be expected in the coming days. Meanwhile, in the Serengeti Park, keepers and emergency services are fighting against time: numerous animals are trapped by the water.\n\"There will be a good swing until Saturday, but it will no longer rain in such large quantities,\" said meteorologist Christian Herold from the DWD on Friday morning in Offenbach. After that, it tones down a bit. According to this, the north of North Rhine-Westphalia in particular must be prepared for the most rainfall. According to the meteorologist, showers are predicted in particular from the Bergisches Land to the Sauerland and north of it from the Weser Uplands to the Harz Mountains. \"In this area, 15 to 20 liters per square meter are expected until Saturday, in reservoirs up to 30 liters per square meter.\" The Harz will be particularly affected. Locally, even higher quantities could be achieved there.\nBut Lower Saxony can't breathe a sigh of relief either: In the north, in the Bremen and Hamburg area, the meteorologist expects less precipitation. \"There are more isolated showers moving through. Maybe there will be short thunderstorms.\" In Saxony, according to Herold, precipitation is limited to the region north of Dresden. \"But these are just very isolated showers.\"\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD makes threatening rain forecast Original report from 29 December : Munich/Dresden – Tension still prevails in numerous regions in Germany, and rain announced by the DWD could even further exacerbate the situation on the ground. Emergency services are already reporting soaked dikes, and in Saxony-Anhalt a dike has now even been opened in a controlled manner. Numerous people have already had to leave their homes, and others are preparing for an imminent evacuation. The situation in Lower Saxony remains particularly tense. Emergency services had to evacuate the first animals from the Serengeti Park on Thursday.\nMy news Thief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nDischarged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nJetstream is heading for Germany: Current weather forecast makes people sit up and take noticeread\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD announces new rain For the coming days, the German Weather Service announces a lot of rain, especially in the already severely affected flood areas, the situation could come to a head. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain must be expected from Friday morning until the night to Saturday. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours.\nTension also continues to prevail on the border between Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. In order to avert the risk of flooding there, a dike of the river Helme has been opened in a controlled manner. The water is now flowing onto fields, the Kyffhäuserkreis district announced on Friday night. The opening was necessary because water had been deliberately drained from the overloaded Kelbra reservoir for several days and the Helmen was carrying a lot of water as a result. According to the district, firefighters have laid around 4,6000 sandbags since Thursday to protect the small town of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth and raise the dikes.\nLower Saxony continues to be severely affected by floods – evacuations prepared In Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. There, the situation worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments as a precaution on Friday night. On Friday morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nThe Weser is flooded in the district of Nienburg/Weser. The situation remains tense. © Moritz Frankenberg/dpa\nPrime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nFlood situation is also causing problems for Bremen – numerous residents have left their homes There is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nFlood situation: No all-clear yet in Dresden either On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded on Friday morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from Friday, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe neither precipitation nor snowmelt until Friday.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.",

    "text": "Vice President Harris addressed her sisters of Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) Sorority Inc., rallying support for the Biden campaign. On July 9, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her sisters of Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) Sorority Inc. during a Dallas convention, rallying support for the Biden campaign. The event, part of the White House’s “Summer of Engagement,” saw Harris emphasizing the administration’s accomplishments and the importance of mobilization. “We know when we organize, mountains move…When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history,” Vice President Harris declared to her fellow Alpha Kappa Alpha members, according to The Washington Post. Harris highlighted the Biden administration’s efforts in healthcare, maternal mortality, student loan debt, and medical debt relief. She also stressed the current threats to fundamental rights, stating, “Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights…” The gathering of 19,000 Black women represents a crucial demographic for the Biden campaign’s reelection hopes. As a Howard University graduate and Alpha Kappa Alpha member, Vice President Harris has consistently engaged with the Divine Nine, the group of historically Black Greek organizations. Her involvement with the sorority has been a significant aspect of her political career and the Biden campaign outreach strategy, especially as the Biden campaign faces challenges, including concerns BE recently noted that escalated from the President’s shaky debate against Donald Trump. Vice President Harris is working to maintain enthusiasm among Black voters for the 2024 election. In 2020, exit polls showed overwhelming support from Black women for the Biden campaign, though recent surveys suggest a potential decline in support among voters of color. Her role extends beyond the Alpha Kappa Alpha event. The Biden campaign has been deploying her to engage various key Democratic constituencies, including Latino, AAPI, and younger voters. Her appearances include a recent campaign event in Las Vegas focused on Asian American, Hawaiian Native, and Pacific Islander voters and an upcoming trip to Greensboro, N.C. The Biden campaign’s strategy of utilizing Vice President Harris’s connections to Alpha Kappa Alpha and other Black organizations is evident in her scheduled meeting with Zeta Phi Beta members in Indianapolis later this month. As previously covered by BLACK ENTERPRISE, she spent last Saturday at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, speaking to a crowd of mostly Black women.",

    "title": "Scientists Create Smart Pill That Vibrates to Make You Feel Full",
    "text": "Researchers at MIT created a high-tech pill that starts to vibrate once it makes contact with gastric fluid in the user’s stomach in order to stimulate receptors in the stomach and create the sensation of fullness. VIBES, short for Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator, was only recently unveiled in a study published in the Science Journal, but it is already being touted by the media as the future of [weight loss](https://www.odditycentral.com/news/weight-loss-device-works-by-preventing-wearers-from-opening-their-mouths-to-chew.html). Although it has yet to be tested on humans, trials on pigs have yielded very promising results. After about 30 minutes of VIBES activity, pigs consumed on average almost 40 percent less food in the next half hour than they did without the smart pill. Apparently, the revolutionary device works by activating stretch receptors in the stomach, simulating the presence of food. This in turn signals the hypothalamus to increase the levels of hormones that make us feel full. Original illustration by V. Fulford “We envision the Vibes pill being ingested on a relatively empty stomach 20 to 30 min before anticipated meals to trigger the desired sensation of satiety early in the meal,” the team that developed VIBES [wrote about the use of the smart pill](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj3003). The VIBES pill was reportedly thought up by Shriya Srinivasan, a former MIT graduate student and postdoc, currently an assistant professor of bioengineering at Harvard University. During his years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he became interested in the idea of controlling the connection between the brain and the stomach by artificially stretching the mechanoreceptors that line the stomach, through vibration. Original illustration by V. Fulford “I wondered if we could activate stretch receptors in the stomach by vibrating them and having them perceive that the entire stomach has been expanded, to create an illusory sense of distension that could modulate hormones and eating patterns,” Srinivasan told [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2023/engineers-develop-vibrating-ingestible-capsule-1222). The vibrating stimulator, which is about the size of a vitamin pill, is powered by an encased battery and activated either by the gastric fluid dissolving a membrane around the pill, or by an incorporated timer. After producing the desired effect, the pill exits the body with other solid waste. The good news is that it is expected to have a cost in the cents to one dollar range, and researchers say that it may eventually be possible to implant the stimulator and thus remove the need for people to constantly ingest it. Photo: Shriya Srinivasan et. al. “Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a low-cost, non-invasive intervention to reduce food intake and calorie consumption. The device functions effectively in the stomach and induces satiety,” said Giovanni Traverso, a gastroenterologist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and co-author of the study. “The device has the potential to revolutionize therapeutic options for patients with obesity. However, future studies will need to explore the physiological effects of the device before it’s available for patients.” Researchers are now exploring ways to scale up the manufacturing of VIBES capsules which could enable clinical trials in humans.",

    "text": "Iglesia perseguida\nDerribar su casa y multa: la amenaza a un obispo chino por celebrar misa\nMonseñor Pedro Shao Zumin es conocido por su oposición a la Iglesia «patriótica» y por haber sido arrestado en numerosas ocasiones\nUna multa de 200.000 yuanes (el equivalente a más de 26.000 euros) por celebrar una misa en público con 200 fieles, sumado a una orden judicial de demolición del edificio donde realiza sus «actividades ilegales», que es la casa con capilla donde vive, son las últimas medidas que han tomado las autoridades de la provincia oriental de Zhejiang contra monseñor Pedro Shao Zumin, obispo de la diócesis de Wenzhou, no reconocido por Beijing por su negativa a unirse a las organizaciones «oficiales» controladas por el Partido Comunista Chino.\nMonseñor Shao Zumin, de 61 años, fue ordenado obispo coadjutor por mandato papal en 2011 y sucedió a su predecesor, monseñor Vincent Zhu Wei-Fang, tras la muerte de este último en septiembre de 2016. Sin embargo, nunca obtuvo el reconocimiento de las autoridades, que consideran «vacante» la sede y apoyan al P. Ma Xianshi –un sacerdote «patriótico»– como guía de la diócesis. Por eso el obispo «clandestino» Shao ha sido arrestado reiteradamente en los últimos años, generalmente en ocasión de las solemnidades, para evitar que los creyentes participen en ritos presididos por él.\nUna misa que celebró el 27 de diciembre en la que participó un nutrido grupo de fieles habría sido precisamente la razón de las nuevas medidas. Según indican dos documentos que compartieron fuentes locales con AsiaNews, las autoridades del distrito de Longwan impusieron una fuerte multa administrativa en base a fotografías tomadas en el lugar y transcripciones de interrogatorios. A ello adjuntan el plan quinquenal de la diócesis de Wenzhou (elaborado por los organismos «oficiales» de la diócesis) para demostrar que la Misa presidida por monseñor Shao fue un acto ilegal. Y considerando que el hecho es una violación grave del artículo 71 del Reglamento sobre Asuntos Religiosos, han decidido fijar una multa de 200.000 yuanes.\nUna posible demolición\nAl mismo tiempo, por la misma misa del 27 de diciembre, otra oficina del gobierno local de Wenzhou emitió una segunda ordenanza contra el edificio donde tuvo lugar la celebración, que es la capilla de la casa donde vive monseñor Shao. Se acusa al obispo de «construcción no autorizada» en un terreno de «aproximadamente 200 metros cuadrados», y que esta conducta viola el artículo 40 de la Ley de Planificación Urbana, decretando una segunda multa de 200.000 yuanes y la demolición del edificio.\nEn síntesis, después de los arrestos, el camino que ha tomado ahora la provincia de Zhejiang contra el obispo «clandestino» son los obstáculos administrativos. En esas mismas semanas, la represión contra los obispos y sacerdotes que se niegan a registrarse también alcanzó a monseñor Guo Xijing en Mindong, provincia de Fujian.\nEn defensa de Francisco\nEs oportuno añadir que, precisamente con ocasión de la Navidad, monseñor Shao difundió en Wenzhou una carta en la que exhortaba a los fieles a vivir el Jubileo en comunión con la Iglesia universal. En el texto, el prelado exhortó a cada parroquia a organizar reuniones para estudiar y reflexionar sobre la bula de invocación del Papa Francisco y a recitar la oración del Año Santo todos los días al final de la Misa, y designó a cada iglesia de la diócesis como lugar para vivir la peregrinación jubilar.\n«Espero que este Jubileo fortalezca nuestra fe, aliente nuestra esperanza y nos haga crecer en la caridad. Porque la esperanza nace del amor y ‘la esperanza no defrauda’ (Rm 5, 5)», dice el prelado al final de su mensaje de Navidad. Palabras que las autoridades de Beijing consideran inaceptables si se pronuncian antes de ser sometidas al estricto control del Partido.",

    "text": "转自： 新华网\n新华社巴黎3月5日电（记者罗毓）欧洲航天局5日在官网发布公报说，最新研究显示，2022年“北溪”天然气管道爆炸泄漏的甲烷在44.5万至48.5万吨之间，而此前估计的泄漏量为7.5万至23万吨。\n这项研究显示，此次泄漏的甲烷约占2022年全球人为甲烷排放总量的0.1%。这相当于当前全球油气行业两天的平均甲烷排放量。\n这项研究由联合国环境规划署下属的国际甲烷排放观测机构协调，30家科研机构参与其中，研究还获得欧洲航天局资金支持，研究结果于今年年初刊登在英国《自然》期刊上。\n研究整合了多种观测手段，包括使用欧洲“全球环境与安全监测系统”（又称哥白尼计划）框架下的“哨兵-1”、“哨兵-2”卫星，以及欧洲气象卫星开发组织的极轨气象卫星Metop-B等。\n研究指出，排放量与此前估算量出现较大差异，是因为最初的排放估算多基于有限的研究数据，此次研究则综合了完整的甲烷收支过程，包括了管道破裂前后管道内甲烷量、泄漏到海水中的甲烷量以及最终进入大气的部分等数据，因而得出更全面准确的结果。\n国际能源署数据显示，2023年全球化石燃料生产和使用过程中产生近1.2亿吨甲烷排放，此外还有生物能源等导致的约1000万吨排放，整体水平自2019年达到峰值后一直徘徊在高位。\n2022年9月26日，连通俄罗斯和德国以及其他欧洲国家的波罗的海海底输气管道“北溪-1”和“北溪-2”在丹麦、瑞典附近海域发生剧烈爆炸，大量天然气泄漏。调查发现，4条管道中的3条发生泄漏，疑遭人为破坏。",

    "title": "Asking Eric: Volatile daughter blames parents for everything",
    "text": "Dear Eric: My husband and I have two daughters, both in their 40s. The younger one has a career, is married and pays her own bills. The other has never been functional and ebbs and flows in and out of stability.\nShe has a volatile and intense personality. She has a husband who is disabled, and they live on the husband’s disability income.\nNo one in the house has any hobbies or even leaves the house except to go to many, many doctors, none of which “work for her.”\nWe do our best to support them as we can, which usually means having them over for dinner, helping to keep their cars running, generous gifts on their birthdays and holidays, but several times a year this daughter will come at us aggressively about some perceived slight.\nWe’ve come to believe that there is not enough time, money or love in the world to make any significant difference in their lives or our relationship. We are currently on a communication break because she showed up unannounced at our house screaming at the most recent imagined slight.\nWe’re not sure if or how to renew the relationship without just setting ourselves up for the next attack. How do we maintain a relationship with her without feeling like we are just beating our heads against the wall?\n– Exhausted Parents\nDear Parents: As parents who’ve witnessed her lifelong struggles – be they the result of emotional or mental imbalances, personality issues, or some combination thereof – you naturally want, and feel a responsibility, to relieve her suffering. It’s frustrating and painful for you and for her that you can’t.\nBut this is not a failure on your part.\nContinuing to hold a very clear, strict boundary about communication will help everyone involved. That may look like telling her “If you are upset, write it down in a letter – not a text. We will read it when we’re emotionally ready to and then we can jointly figure out how to address it, if at all.”\nIt will probably be hard for her to understand that the narrative in her head isn’t one that you are responsible for nor one that you have to be a part of. But processing those feelings is her work to do.\nAn equal part of this healthy boundary is recognizing the places where you and your husband are trying to fix things that are beyond your control and releasing them. You would likely do anything to solve her problems, but being available to be browbeaten whenever she wants is not a solution. If you can work on letting go of the expectation you have of yourselves, you’ll also find it easier to maintain a boundary that can actually lead to change.\nDear Eric: I have an acquaintance whom I avoid every chance I get.\nNot only does this woman latch onto me every time she sees me, but the worst part, besides not being able to get away from her, is the deplorable way she speaks of her daughter.\nShe controls her every move and puts her down every chance she gets. Her daughter, in my opinion, was a very sweet, loving child, but as an adult she is now a heroin addict with no direction.\nThis woman gripes incessantly on how she sees others with their children and how proud they are, but she has nothing to be proud of. And she still wants to control her daughter who is now 30, and all the while talks terribly about her.\nShould I continue listening to her nonsense, or should I give her a mouthful of the home truths about her daughter that she deserves?\n– Exasperated\nDear Exasperated: Should you continue wasting your time? In this one precious life? No.\nDear Eric: I am in a group of friends who have socialized with each other for more than 30 years. About a year ago one of the couples moved into a continuous care community due to physical and cognitive issues. Surprisingly, only two women from our group have taken the time to visit with them during this time. At a recent social gathering, I began to tell the group about my visit. Before I could finish, the group moved on to another topic. It’s really sad how we write off people once they become ill or disabled. Please remind your readers that friends and family who are homebound or in care facilities enjoy the company. Even one hour of your time can make their day.\n– Concerned Friend\nDear Friend: While this isn’t a question, it’s a good reminder for everyone. And also, an opportunity for you. I hope you’ll take the chance to speak with your friends about how their perceived callousness struck you. Sometimes friendship means showing up; sometimes friendship means calling out.\n(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

The original Python files were replaced with the executable poc.exe, which was packed with UPX.\nThe executable’s unusual existence in a Python-based project raises suspicions, even though the repository initially appears to be normal.\nRepository containing “poc.exe” A PowerShell script is dropped and run in the %Temp% folder when a user runs the file. A Scheduled Job will be created as a result, and it will then run an encoded script.\nAfter being decoded, the script obtains another script from Pastebin that gathers the victim’s computer’s public IP address and uploads it via FTP.\nAccording to researchers , the following data is gathered, compressed using ZIP, and then uploaded using hardcoded credentials to an external FTP server.\nComputer information Process list Directory lists (Downloads, Recent, Documents, and Desktop) Network IPs Network adapters Installed updates Exfiltrating the gathered information (Source: TrendMicro) Hence, download dependencies, libraries, and code only from reputable and official sources. official sources. Watch out for repositories that appear to be hosting a tool or application that isn’t compatible with their suspicious content.\nVerify the identification of the organization or repository owner and look for anomalies or indications of malicious activity in the commit history and most recent modifications of the repository.\nAdditionally, repositories that claim to be extensively used yet have very few stars, forks, or contributors should be avoided. Look for reviews, problems, or conversations regarding the repository to spot any warning signs.\nFind this News Interesting! Follow us on Google News , LinkedIn , and X to Get Instant Updates!",

    "text": "Uncomfortable weather is showing no sign of letting up for a Sydney to Hobart fleet already battered by squally conditions that have damaged yachts and broken ribs.\nMore than 70 boats remained at sea late on Friday afternoon, with the day's first finisher not arriving until 1pm (AEDT) - some 29 hours after LawConnect claimed line honours victory.\nTasmanian yacht Alive, which finished on Thursday, is primed to take out overall honours for a second occasion with a time that appears unbeatable.\nOfficial confirmation is likely to occur on Saturday.\nNo Limit and 12-year-old luxury cruiser Whisper were among a handful of yachts to make it to the safety of Hobart's Constitution Dock on Friday afternoon.\n\"Tough ... wet, lumpy, plenty of wind. But the team did an amazing job,\" No Limit skipper David Gotze said after his seventh-place finish across the line.\n\"We did the best with what we could do in the circumstances.\"\nThe retirement tally stands at 16 from 103 starters following a stormy Boxing Day night at sea.\nA strong wind warning is in place for waters off Tasmania's east coast, where a chunk of the fleet is tracking south.\nCruising Yacht Club of Australia commodore Arthur Lane said winds of 35 knots and 4.5-metre seas were expected on Friday afternoon and night.\n\"It is certainly slower than the last few years and that is because of the wind. It is an uphill race,\" he told AAP.\n\"It's going to be a very uncomfortable night.\"\nNSW entrant Salt Lines, veteran of 22 Sydney to Hobart races, and 52-footer Gunshot pulled the pin on Thursday night because of damage to their sails.\nRobbie Fisher, skipper of 66-footer Helsal 3, reported a broken mainsail rope, torn sail and \"other little things\".\n\"We have a minor injury to a crew ... our navigator was on deck, slipped, and cracked a couple of ribs,\" he said.\n\"We copped a beating across (Bass) Strait. We had over 30 knots and it was pretty bad. We have persevered though.\"\nHong Kong entrant Antipodes, crewed by Lindsay May in his 50th race, was slated to finish at some point on Friday.\n\"We've had some down time ... with breeze holes that our competitors didn't get,\" crew member Brad Kellett said.\n\"We've got a tear in the new mainsail to repair. We blew out our J2 headsail.\"\nThe Darren Hine-skippered Alive, overall winner in 2018, finished as clubhouse leader on handicap time.\nThe overall winner, which is awarded the Tattersall Cup, is judged on handicap which takes into account factors including the size of the boat.\nLawConnect won line honours on Thursday morning, coming from behind to beat fellow 100-footer and 2022 winner Andoo Comanche by just 51 seconds in the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history.\n ",
