    "text": "This report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our new, international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\nWhat you need to know today Hot jobs market\nThe U.S. labor market added 216,000 jobs in December. That's much more than the 170,000 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones, and the downwardly revised 173,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, defying estimates of a 10-basis-point rise. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 4.1% from a year earlier, higher than the 3.9% forecast.\nLosing week\nU.S. stocks inched up slightly Friday, but couldn't reverse a weekly decline. Treasury yields ticked up for the second day, with the 10-year yield closing at 4.051%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index retreated 0.27% . Retail stocks fell 1.1%, leading sector losses, after data showed German retail sales fell 2.5% for the month, much more than estimates of a 0.1% slide.\nGet San Diego local news, weather forecasts, sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC San Diego newsletters.\nGrounded airplanes\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has ordered a temporary grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, which means airlines won't be able to use those particular Boeing models for flying. The directive comes after a piece of the aircraft blew out in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole on the side of the plane.\nPotential Apple lawsuit\nApple just can't catch a break. Fresh off a downgrade to its shares by Barclays and Piper Sandler , the technology giant is potentially facing an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a report from The New York Times. The lawsuit could target how the Apple Watch works exclusively with the iPhone, as well as the company's iMessage service, which excludes non-Apple devices.\n[PRO] Numbers to watch\nThe U.S. consumer price index report comes out Thursday this week, and will be the major catalyst for markets as investors assess if the U.S. Federal Reserve is edging closer to its goal of keeping inflation at 2%. But don't neglect Friday, which is jam-packed with earnings reports from big banks such as JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Bank of America .",

    "title": "Presidente Petro vuelve a pedirle al Banco de la República bajar las tasas de interés",
    "text": "Este viernes 29 de diciembre, el Gobierno Nacional reveló que el salario mínimo para 2024 subirá en un 12 %, y serán $140.000 adicionales, pasando de ganar $1.160.000 a devengar ahora $1.300.000.En cuanto al auxilio de transporte, destinado a cubrir este gasto mensual, ahora se fijará en $162.000, lo que eleva el total que un trabajador recibirá en 2024 a $1.462.000. En ese sentido, el presidente de la República, Gustavo Petro, destacó en rueda de prensa que: “Sobre la economía que viene, a partir del 1 de enero, yo quiero hacer algunas propuestas”.Y añadió: “Indudablemente, la tasa de interés, que está hoy en 13 %, y bajó 0,25 %, estamos subiendo hoy el salario mínimo a una tasa menor que las tasas de interés. Es una invitación al Banco de la República a bajar más la tasa de interés”.Y resaltó que el peso se está revaluando, y “está a punto de bajar de los $3.800, y tienen que ver con que hay un mayor flujo de dólares a la economía nacional, y eso tiene que ver con un diferencial de tasas de interés reales entre nuestra economía y las economías desarrolladas”.“Cada vez es más grande la tasa de interés colombiana, respecto a la de Estados Unidos y a la de Europa, y eso atrae el flujo”.Vale la pena recordar que la junta del Banco de la República tomó la decisión hace unos días, alrededor de la cual venía presionando el ministro de Hacienda, Ricardo Bonilla, junto con otros sectores del país que pedían de manera insistente una baja en las tasas de interés, para no seguir ahogando el consumo de los hogares, que se han mostrado temerosos de tomar créditos caros. Los integrantes del equipo que maneja la política monetaria en Colombia decidieron soltar un poco el apretón que venían haciendo y bajar las tasas de interés en 0,25 % , con lo cual quedan en 13 %, después de haber permanecido en 13,25 % durante meses, sin que todos los expertos se pusieran de acuerdo en empezar el ciclo bajista, principalmente por los riesgos que hay para que la inflación siga estando en dos dígitos.",

    "text": "It seems that the administration of President Joe Biden ably supported by a know-nothing bought Congress leans over backwards to make sure that it never is tempted to do the right thing for the American people. I am not necessarily talking about Genocide Joe’s regrettable interactions with our favorite comedian pretending to be a head of state Volodymyr Zelensky or with Israel’s despicable Benjamin Netanyahu, but rather am thinking about the instances where the government might act to benefit an American and instead does nothing but sit on its hands, metaphorically speaking, and exhibit instead a vacant, self-satisfied grin.\nI am particularly thinking\nof the death of Chilean-American journalist Gonzalo Lira that took place on January 11th at a hospital in Kharkov in Ukraine. Lira has been living in Ukraine and it has been suggested that he has a Ukrainian wife and children. He has written three novels and is a regular poster with videos and articles on YouTube under the user name Coach Red Pill, where he has obtained a considerable audience as a truth teller. He also has appeared on alternative news shows to include Tucker Carlson, who announced on his page on X the news of Lira’s death. Lira had developed into a prominent and reliable commentator on the Russia-Ukraine war and was arrested and imprisoned for speaking and writing on conflict related issues critical of the Volodymyr Zelensky government. Lira reportedly had made no friends in the Ukrainian government when he accurately called Ukraine’s leader a “cokehead,” and perhaps hyperbolically described the Russian operation as “one of the most brilliant invasions in military history.”",

    "title": "Global sea levels jumped due to El Nino: Nasa - World - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "WASHINGTON: Global average sea levels rose by about 0.3 inches (one-third of an inch) from 2022 to 2023 — nearly four times the increase of the previous year — Nasa said on Thursday, attributing the “significant jump” to a strong El Nino and a warming climate. The Nasa-led analysis is based on more than 30 years of satellite observations, with the initial satellite launching in 1992 and the latest in 2020. Overall, sea levels have risen by around four inches since 1993. The rate of increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches per year in 1993, to the current rate of 0.17 inches per year. “Current rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimetres (eight inches) of global mean sea level by 2050,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the Nasa sea level change team and the ocean physics programme in Washington. That would be double the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous century, she said, creating a future where flooding is far more frequent and catastrophic than today. The immediate cause of the spike is the El Nino weather effect, which replaced the La Nina from 2021 to 2022, when the sea level rose around 0.08 inches. El Nino involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Published in Dawn, March 22nd, 2024",

The movie which was released on December 01, 2023, featured Ranbir Kapoor, and Rashmika Mandanna in lead roles. The movie earned an impressive Rs 800 crore gross worldwide. Now, Rashmika Mandanna has recently opened up about one of the intense scenes in the film where she slapped her onscreen husband, played by Ranbir Kapoor.\nDuring a conversation with Pinkvilla, the actress revealed that she ended up crying and screaming after the scene was over. She also remembered the guidance provided by director Sandeep Reddy Vanga before the scene, which proved to be helpful for her. Revealing more details, the actress said, “The whole sequence was one take because there was a lot of moving. It wasn’t predictable. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Sandeep told me just to feel how a person in this situation would feel. I remember only this. I don’t remember anything between the action and the cut. I just can’t process it. My brain was just going blank.”\nIn a scene in the film, Rashmika’s character was seen slapping husband Rannvijay, after he revealed that he spent a night with Zoya which was played by Triptii Dimri. Later, Ranvijay can be seen telling Gitanjali that he had to sleep with Zoya to know about her true intentions. After hearing this, Gitanjali loses her calm and slaps him and the couple ends up having a fight.\nRashmika’s Reaction to the Slap\nPost the scene, Rashmika went to Ranbir to comfort him. The actress said, “After the sequence, I was crying for real. I have slapped him, I am screaming, the chaos is happening, and I go to Ranbir, and I am like, ‘Was that okay? Are you okay?’ We finished that sequence in half a day. I loved it, and at that moment, I realised that this was the high of being an actor. People don’t write sequences like this every time. I am so glad that I did this movie and this sequence. I was surprised with myself.”\nAbout the film Animal\nHelmed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Animal was one of the hit movies at the box office. The movie went on to become one of the highest-grossers of last year. Apart from Rashmika and Ranbir, the movie also features Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol in key roles. Despite being surrounded by misogyny and violence, the movie minted crores at the box office.\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on\nEntertainment News on India.com.",
