    "text": "Türkiye propels into space history with launch of country's first astronaut Türkiye's venture into crewed cosmic exploration begins on the country's centennial anniversary as Colonel Alper Gezeravci soars into space among the four-person crew of Axiom Mission 3. Colonel Alper Gezeravci, a fighter pilot in the Turkish Air Force, has blasted off to space for a two-week mission in the International Space Station [ISS], putting Türkiye among the group of nations which have successfully sent astronauts into space. \"It's a very symbolic, important step. However, it's not the last. It's the beginning of a journey for our great country,\" Colonel Gezeravci told TRT World in an exclusive interview ahead of the historic launch on Thursday, a first for Türkiye's ambitious National Space Program. The four-person crew blasted off at 2149 GMT (00:49 am Türkiye time) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States, aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule carried by a Falcon 9 rocket. Gezeravci’s highly anticipated first remarks in space were an echo from the early years of the Turkish Republic, as he [quoted](https://x.com/Tubitak/status/1748144568824991834?s=20) the country’s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk: \"Istikbal goklerdedir!\" (The future is in the skies). The launch was initially scheduled for Wednesday but got postponed for \"teams to complete pre-launch checkouts and data analysis on the vehicle,\" SpaceX [wrote on X](https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1747657133351690565?s=20). The Ax-3 crew are expected to travel for approximately 36 hours before docking on the ISS on January 20, at around 0953 GMT (12:53 pm Türkiye time). Liftoff for— Axiom Space (@Axiom_Space) [#Ax3]🚀 The first all-European commercial astronaut mission has lifted off! Go [#Ax3] [pic.twitter.com/ihFElmx14q] [January 18, 2024] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed the significance of the mission, both as a scientific endeavour and as a source of inspiration for young people, saying: \"We are all witnessing a historical moment together. We are experiencing one of those times when our common pride rises to its peak.\" Live video streamed online by Axiom showed the two-stage 25-storey-tall launch vehicle streaking into partly cloudy skies over Florida's Atlantic coast atop a fiery, yellowish tail of exhaust. Cameras inside the crew compartment beamed footage of the four men strapped into their pressurized cabin, seated calmly in helmeted white-and-black flight suits as the rocket soared toward space. Nine minutes after launch, the rocket's upper stage delivered the crew capsule to its preliminary orbit, according to launch commentators. Meanwhile, the rocket's reusable lower stage, having detached from the rest of the spacecraft, flew itself back to Earth and safely touched down on a landing zone near the launch site. 'A historic occasion' In pre-launch interviews, 44-year-old Gezeravci emphasised that he never even dreamt of becoming an astronaut because that only seemed possible for the children of other nations. But on January 18, as he carried Türkiye's aspirations to the ISS, the sky ceased to be the limit. \"I will be proud from now on... (knowing) that my country has carried out, with a strong will and determination, a crewed mission into space,\" Gezeravci said in a video interview from Orlando, Florida, while in mandatory pre-launch quarantine. \"It's definitely a historic occasion for the country's centennial anniversary … which will inspire our future generations on their paths into deep space,\" he added, expressing that he couldn't find the words to describe the joy and honour he felt to be part of this mission. Following Gezeravci, Türkiye's second astronaut - 31-year-old engineer Tuva Cihangir Atasever - will take on the second phase of the mission, lifting off for a suborbital flight in the first half of 2024. Contributing to space science Ax-3’s all-European crew includes Axiom Space chief astronaut and former ISS commander [Michael Lopez-Alegria](https://www.axiomspace.com/astronaut/michael-lopez-alegria), representing Spain and the US as the Ax-3 mission commander. In 2022, he led Axiom Mission 1 (Ax-1), the first private mission to the ISS. The mission pilot is Colonel [Walter Villadei](https://www.axiomspace.com/astronaut/walter-villadei) from the Italian Air Force. [Gezeravci](https://www.axiomspace.com/astronaut/alper-gezeravci), an F-16 fighter pilot, is taking part in Ax-3 as a mission specialist alongside Swedish astronaut [Marcus Wandt](https://www.axiomspace.com/astronaut/marcus-wandt) from the European Space Agency. Once docked, the crew are set to stay at the ISS for 14 days, during which they will attend to their country-related science missions. Gezeravci will conduct 13 scientific experiments prepared by Turkish scientists and research institutions. \"It's a really thorough mission, embracing several fields,\" Gezeravci told TRT World, emphasising the significance of his mission in contributing to science. Each experiment in space defines the parameters of human existence in the cosmic environment and offers new perspectives or breakthroughs for issues here on Earth. Among the 13 experiments Türkiye will conduct on the ISS is PRANET, created by middle school students from Türkiye's eastern city of Mus, which examines the antibacterial effects of propolis in microgravity environments. The experiments concern a wide range of scientific fields, from materials science to biotechnology, electronic engineering, and cancer research. Notably, the MYELOID experiment inquires into the effect of radiation exposure on cancer cells in the space environment. Another experiment, EXTREMOPHYTE, involves an endemic plant from Türkiye's Salt Lake, which can remove salt from soil and water, investigating the response of plants to different levels of salt stress in the space environment and their future space ecosystem potential. Gezeravci underscored that a Turkish astronaut's presence in the ISS gives the nation's scientists \"equal competition opportunity\" in fields where they have already been putting forward valuable studies. He expressed a strong belief that his mission will foster \"an ambition and inspiration in several fields\" for Turkish people, young and old alike, \"who are intending to step into space as astronauts or scientists, as well as aviators\". Surprise items from Türkiye to ISS Türkiye's inaugural crewed space mission is also a testament to the unity forged among nations in the pursuit of scientific exploration, from the international crew of Ax-3 to collaborations with Axiom Space, SpaceX and NASA. \"Working with the people from your own country, you are bringing together your heritage, background and experience. In this kind of international environment, you are able to bring together the unique experience coming from different countries,\" Gezeravci told TRT World. \"When it comes to bringing all our strengths together, that turns out to be a great composition,\" he explained. In a pre-launch press conference of the Ax-3 Crew, Gezeravci revealed that he would be bringing some surprise items from Türkiye to the ISS as a symbol of the country's renowned hospitality against the international backdrop of the station. The trailblazing Turkish astronaut is also bringing personal mementoes for the monumental journey, including family photographs, items representing his nomadic Turkish heritage and patches of his first Air Force squadron alongside a Turkish flag. While Türkiye had already established its place as a formidable force in space exploration and technology as one of the ten countries that can construct their own [satellites](https://www.trtworld.com/turkiye/turkiye-launches-first-domestic-observation-satellite-imece-into-space-12800133), a crewed space mission was among the primary goals of Türkiye's 10-year National Space Program, led by the Turkish Space Agency [TUA] and the Ministry of Industry and Technology. As Gezeravci proudly carries Türkiye's crescent moon and star into its place in the cosmos on the 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic, his [mission patch](https://x.com/tuajans/status/1735244521422954892?s=20) is adorned with symbols of this victory. The patch, which holds the shape of a Seljuk star, also features 16 stars, representing the 16 Turkic nations. A nod to Türkiye's centennial anniversary is also seen on the [Ax-3 mission patch](https://www.axiomspace.com/news/ax3-mission-patch), with the number 100 inscribed on its lower part. With Türkiye joining the ranks of nations capable of carrying out successful crewed space missions, Gezeravci’s journey to the ISS shines as a beacon of the nation’s trajectory into a promising future in space exploration and scientific innovation in the Century of Türkiye. Gezeravci has the potential to ignite a similar effect in Türkiye as John F. Kennedy did when he kickstarted the US space programme, said TRT World's Andy Roesgen who was reporting the historic event from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.",

    "text": "Loud Cash, Quiet Power: Foundations Extend Political Tentacles …six-figure foundation salaries, skirting laws regarding charities and politics By [Thomas Buckley](https://californiaglobe.com/author/thomas-buckley/), December 28, 2023 2:25 pm Over the past decade or so, numerous California foundations have moved beyond the idea of doing good for the general community and now do good for very specifically chosen activists – and themselves. Groups like the Tides Foundation and The California Endowment use their massive piggybanks to fund overtly political organizations. A short time ago, the Los Angeles Times finally noticed this shift and they think it is just fine – much more than fine, actually. And why does the Times think its perfectly wonderful that unaccountable and supposedly non-political (it’s in the law…kinda) non-profits and foundations are dumping buckets of – in many cases, their parents’ – money into the civic realm? You’re so far ahead of me I’m not sure I even have to type the words “social justice.” “Over the last decade, more and more of L.A.’s institutional foundations have gotten behind that idea: trusting nonprofits with increasing amounts of money, with fewer restrictions,” [wrote the Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-14/la-me-philanthropy). “L.A.’s leading philanthropic foundations have ‘transformed’ themselves, says Aaron Dorfman, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. These formerly tradition-bound charitable institutions have become ‘national leaders in their commitment to equity and justice,’ he says.” Even more directly, note the Times: “There’s a sea shift in who has power in California,” says John Kim, president and CEO of Catalyst California, which advocates for racial justice and whose revenue has doubled in recent years. “Money is power, and the foundations are giving it directly to people of color.” Did the Times mention six-figure foundation salaries, skirting laws regarding charities and politics, the fact that the current use of funds may not quite align with the vision of the people who actually made and then donated the money, that the ethics of such a shift are at best dubious, or that maybe – just maybe – not everyone supports such activities? Of course not. One could argue that the foundations are merely following the societal trends of the people who fund and run them – well-paid, hyper-credentialed, guilty of their success progressive types who are absolutely sure they know better because they have letters after their name or have “lived experience” that the old guard could not begin to comprehend. But that would miss a crucial part of the “chicken or egg?” equation because the foundations bought the chickens years ago – aptly, if figuratively – to lay the egg that is the current state of California. In other words, none of what has happened in the philanthropy world is a coincidence. Not convinced? In 1999, Fred Ali was tapped to lead the Weingart Foundation and quickly began replacing an “aging, all-white” board with people aligned with his progressive vision.” Ali retired in 2021 and was replaced by Miguel Santana, notes the Times, who proceeded to launch a “truth and reconciliation” effort, hiring Edgar Villanueva. Villanueva is the author of “Decolonizing Wealth,” an indictment of old-school American philanthropy, said the Times: “Coming to terms with that history,” says Villanueva, “grieving that, apologizing for it,” sets the stage for “reparations to repair the harm caused by that history.” In its grantmaking, the Weingart Foundation applies “an equity framework to all of our decision-making, asking how the choices we make advance racial, social and economic justice.” The [relationship between the Weingart Foundation and Weingart Center](https://thomas699.substack.com/p/a-costbenefit-analysis-of-permanent) – a significant part of the homeless-industrial complex making bank off of the absurd idea of “permanent supportive housing” – is not exactly clear. The Times also highlights The California Endowment. If that name is familiar, that’s because [the Globe has run a series of articles on how awful and deceitful it is](https://thomas699.substack.com/p/is-california-well-endowed). The California Endowment was created when a non-profit health insurance company bought a for-profit one and the state demanded it do something nice for the state, hence the creation of the Endowment specifically to improve health care and access to insurance in California. Now, [the Endowment does no such thing](https://thomas699.substack.com/p/pennies-for-health-care-millions): $50,000 dollars – That’s what The California Endowment awarded in grants specifically to “make health insurance accessible to all in California.” $70,000,000 dollars, at least – That’s what the Endowment spent on advocacy, organizing, media, communications, empowerment, etc. grants. The egregious ethics and base immorality of a $4.4 billion dollar foundation created specifically to improve health care access for the un-and-underinsured of the state spending barely even a token amount of money on its statutory purpose is perfectly clear. Whether or not it’s legal is a bit less so. The Endowment pays Dr. Bob Ross about a million dollars a year as its president. Initially, he told the Times, that he worked hard to “alleviate misery with charity.” But eventually he had a change of heart: “Poor Black and brown folks are at the short end of health disparities,” says Ross, “which tells you what we’re dealing with is structural. It’s systemic. It’s not bad luck.” In 2010 he shifted millions of dollars from the health initiative and started funding advocacy efforts by several nonprofits that, by 2021, permanently expanded Medi-Cal eligibility to a broad underserved population across the state. And never underestimate the power of groupthink or not wanting to be left an invitation list. The Times utterly uncritically notes that “Ali, Ross, (and others) formed a new progressive core within L.A.’s philanthropic ecosystem. In 2014, Don Howard became president and CEO of the James Irvine Foundation and joined their ranks.” So Don got to sit at the cool kids table at lunch – good for him. The Times moves from one wonderful equitable funding success to the next of its lionized foundations, [ from the Youth Justice Coalition](https://youthjusticela.org/) here’s a screenshot from the website: …to the [Afrikan Black Coalition](https://www.afrikanblackcoalition.org/), a group born out of the UC system that lists as it values “Mass Organization, Pan-Afrikanism, Black Nationalism, Collective Economics.” (For a fully-immersive experience in woke thinking, please do read the entire Times piece. [It does the owner’s very rich very woke daughter proud](https://thomas699.substack.com/p/this-genocide-is-on-livestream).) The big question the Times did not ask or even allude to – because they see it as wonderful and do not really ever ask questions of people and systems they support – is why, beyond cultural cachet, have the foundations shifted. Maybe the question wasn’t asked because the answer is so obvious: power. Foundations and non-profits are, for the most part, seen by the public as neutral arbiters of the good. People think of their local “friend of the library” group or the Kiwanis adopting a road when they hear “non-profit.” They do not think of them as key elements in the obliterative transformation of society. Foundations hide behind this residual goodwill – “we don’t do this for money, we do it for you.” Psychologically, that position is very handy, especially when you are paid the kind of money the foundations pay their staff. Few people are more insufferable than those who think they are doing good while doing very well indeed. The power does not stop at cash, though. The literally thousands of organizations that live off of foundation (and government) money will never ever really criticize the power structure of which they are a part; despite the protests, the screaming of racism, the strident language of being transformative, the loud criticism of all things “systemic,” they do not want the system to change to the point they may be out of a job – they just want a bigger piece of the pie and they are happily cowed as “stakeholders” in the blob. From the article “Infective Maltruism:” “…’friendly’ oligarchical systems will use them often to both provide a sheen of respectability and to reward and/or create political allyship with various groups, such as non-governmental organizations, academia, social service providers, and such. As the saying goes, if you are not at the table, your dinner. And, as demonstrated perfectly by the Times piece, the foundations and agencies and activists and community organizations create an unassailable “feedback loop” of backscratching, a nearly impenetrable fortress of progressive money that creates the public image of ultimate do-gooding. And they are very handy to have around for the Times, too – whenever they need a quote to support some absurdity they favor, there they are. The foundation shift nearly exactly mirrors the shift in academia towards an increasingly totalitarian/statist view of the world, a world run by properly credentialed bureaucrats for the good of the people at the behest of their moneyed overlords. When [the political terraforming is complete ](https://thomas699.substack.com/p/political-terraforming)when the last vestiges of a society being perceived – and run – as a group of discrete of individuals and not a collective mass, the folks currently on the generous end of the foundations’ money should realize that they will be waved aside and dismissed as the useful idiots they are. And that’s power. [see all](https://californiaglobe.com/author/thomas-buckley/)) - [Swap Out Su: Reps.

Better to have the information than not have it, overwhelming and unsolvable as it seems. Most so-called non-profits have never been ‘non-profit’ and now the non-profits and foundations only grow and grow until they become like “The Blob” covering every inch or even “Godzilla,” stomping around and destroying our system. What is the answer? - Waiving aside the useful idiots currently on the generous end of these corrupt foundations’ money cannot come soon enough.",

    "text": "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) delayed for the second time the launch of its ambitious SpaDeX mission, which was originally scheduled to be launched on December 30.\nThe SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30. Giving an update on the status of the mission, ISRO on Thursday said the drift which forced the national space agency to postpone the ambitious space docking experiment under the SpaDeX mission has been arrested.\nAlso Read: What is ISRO SpaDeX mission for space docking experiment? “The drift has been arrested and spacecrafts put in a slow drift course to move closer to each other. By tomorrow, it is expected to reach initialisation conditions,” ISRO wrote in a post on X on Thursday evening.\nWhy ISRO delayed SpaDeX launch twice?\nThe SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30 last year and the docking was scheduled for January 7. However, the experiment was postponed to the morning of January 9 and deferred again on the rescheduled date.\nISRO notified the second deferment on the eve of the rescheduled date.\n“While making a maneuver to reach 225 m between satellites the drift was found to be more than expected, post non-visibility period. The planned docking for tomorrow is postponed. Satellites are safe. Stay tuned for updates,” the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency posted on X.\nAlso Read: How ISRO's SpaDex mission will pave way for Chandrayaan-4, Gaganyaan SpaDeX is a cost-effective technology mission for the demonstration of in-space docking with two small spacecraft. The primary objective is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for the rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft, which have been named “SDX01” (Chaser) and “SDX02” (Target).\nUnion minister Jitendra Singh last week said the SpaDeX mission was named \"Bharatiya Docking Technology\" as it is purely an indigenous mission , and India is carrying out the first such experiment related to docking technology.\nSingh, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Earth Sciences also stated that SpaDeX \"very much aligns with Prime Minister Modi's vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”\n(With inputs from ANI )\nGet Current Updates on...

    "text": "Saltillo: Muere hombre de un infarto mientras se bañaba\nLa noche del miércoles 6 de enero, un hombre perdió la vida de forma repentina en el interior de su domicilio, ubicado en la colonia Ampliación Morelos, en Saltillo, luego de sufrir un infarto fulminante mientras se bañaba.\nEl incidente ocurrió alrededor de las 8:30 de la noche, en una casa situada en la calle 64, esquina con 13, donde Iván “N”, de quien no se precisó la edad, ingresó al baño para asearse. Sin embargo, tras varios minutos sin tener noticias de él, sus familiares comenzaron a preocuparse. Al ingresar para revisar qué ocurría, lo encontraron desplomado en el piso.\nTE PUEDE INTERESAR: Septuagenario se quita la vida tras pedir a familiar que se retirara, en Ramos Arizpe\nDe inmediato se solicitó el apoyo de los cuerpos de emergencia a través del sistema 911. Al arribar, paramédicos del cuerpo de Bomberos confirmaron que Iván ya no contaba con signos vitales.\nPersonal de la Fiscalía General del Estado (FGE) acudió al lugar para realizar el levantamiento del cuerpo y ordenar su traslado al Servicio Médico Forense (Semefo), con el objetivo de descartar indicios de violencia y confirmar, mediante la necropsia, que se trató de una muerte natural provocada por un paro cardíaco.\nLas autoridades exhortan a la población a no ignorar síntomas relacionados con problemas cardíacos, especialmente en temporadas de bajas temperaturas, que pueden representar un factor de riesgo adicional.",
