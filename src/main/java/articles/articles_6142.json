    "text": "A Petrobras anunciou, nesta quinta-feira (3), uma \"enorme descoberta\" de gás natural no Caribe colombiano, que pode duplicar as reservas do país, que enfrenta uma seca severa que ameaça o abastecimento de energia. Esta é a maior descoberta desde a década de 1990, com reservas por seis terapés cúbicos de gás, e \"tem o potencial de duplicar as reservas da Colômbia\", informou o gerente geral de Ativos Exploratórios da Petrobras, Rogério Soares, durante um evento em Cartagena (norte). O tamanho do reservatório é comparável ao do Campo Cuchupa em Ríohacha (norte), que forneceu gás ao país nos últimos 45 anos. \"É uma grande conquista na história da exploração da Colômbia\", acrescentou Soares na VIII Cúpula de Petróleo, Gás e Energia, o evento mais importante da indústria no país. O anúncio foi feito após o governo de esquerda de Gustavo Petro lançar um plano para buscar investimentos de US$ 40 bilhões (R$ 226 bilhões na cotação atual) com o objetivo de financiar a transição energética do país. Ferrenho defensor do meio ambiente, o presidente colombiano aposta na substituição da indústria ligada aos hidrocarbonetos, um setor que representa 52% das exportações nacionais. Petro freou a exploração de hidrocarbonetos para priorizar fontes renováveis como a energia solar e eólica. Contudo, a oposição e um setor da indústria consideram que esta decisão poderia colocar em risco a autossuficiência energética do país. A Colômbia atravessa uma temporada de calor incomum, que aumentou o risco de escassez de energia e apagões, alertam especialistas. Segundo dados da Naturgas, sindicato nacional das empresas de gás, em 2025 o país terá um déficit deste hidrocarboneto equivalente a 7,5% da demanda total e, em 2026, aumentará para 16%. Em meio à crise hídrica gerada pelo fenômeno climático El Niño, a Colômbia aumentou suas importações de gás em 2.500% entre 2022 e 2023. O gás natural representa entre 25% e 30% da demanda nacional por energia, segundo números do setor. Em 2023, as reservas comprovadas de gás do país eram de 2.373 gigapés cúbicos (Gpc), segundo dados oficiais. (AFP)",

    "text": "Kriya Announces Gene Therapy Program for Thyroid Eye Disease – KRIYA-586 is designed to be a one-time treatment delivered by focal peribulbar injection, that encodes an antibody blocking the Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF-1R), a clinically validated drug target in Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) – – Kriya expects its TED gene therapy candidate to enter the clinic in 2025 – PALO ALTO, Calif. and RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Jan. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Kriya Therapeutics, Inc.,](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GYInKkngzhyJKhihyb3h-M97RC2P--8YC8JWaKyH8T5EWKNDb-QykGzS_oq9A0gm_tDrJ7Ated9kbZO_8q8ifBtcPZjIqm6cGO8vWQb8RXI=) (Kriya) a biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies for common diseases affecting millions of people around the world, today announced its gene therapy program for thyroid eye disease (TED), a debilitating autoimmune condition resulting in proptosis and diplopia, medical terms describing bulging of the eyes and double vision respectively, due to inflammation of the muscles and fat tissue behind the eye. TED affects approximately one million people in the United States and the European Union. Kriya is developing KRIYA-586, a one-time, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy that drives durable expression of a monoclonal antibody that blocks IGF-1 receptors. The therapy is designed for in-office administration by peribulbar injection into the fat surrounding the eye, where cells are engineered to locally produce and secrete an antibody that blocks IGF-1 receptors on myocytes, adipocytes and fibroblasts. IGF-1R blockade has been established as a clinically validated mechanism of action, as evidenced by teprotumumab, the first and only FDA-approved therapy for TED. KRIYA-586 has been evaluated in multiple large animal species, and the company plans to present data from these studies at upcoming medical conferences. \"We believe that an in-office, focally administered gene therapy for TED would meaningfully improve the quality of life of people with TED, with the potential to durably address the disease following one-time injection,” said Shankar Ramaswamy, M.D., Co-Founder and CEO of Kriya. “Together with our gene therapy for geographic atrophy, today’s public announcement of our TED program reflects our deep commitment to advancing the field of ophthalmology by developing transformational gene therapies aimed at addressing common causes of vision loss and blindness.” Kriya has designed its TED gene therapy candidate with the following goals: - One-time, in-office peribulbar injection may minimize the treatment burden for patients - Localized antibody expression in extraocular muscles and fat tissue may limit the potential for side effects that can be observed with systemically administered therapies - Durable AAV-mediated antibody expression may deliver sustained improvements in proptosis and diplopia as well as other key manifestations of TED Dr. Ramaswamy will present an overview of Kriya’s pipeline and platform at the J.P. Morgan 42nd Annual Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, January 9th at 9:00 AM PT in San Francisco, California. About Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) TED is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and enlargement of the muscles and fat tissue behind the eye. This results in proptosis and diplopia which can significantly impact quality of life of patients with TED. Teprotumumab is the only FDA approved therapy for the treatment of TED, and is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody that works by blocking IGF-1 receptors. However, many patients who receive this systemically administered therapy experience severe side effects such as hearing loss and hyperglycemia as well as a loss of durability of effect despite initial responses. There is a need for safe and durable treatments that can address the approximately one million patients in the United States and the European Union who have TED. About Kriya Therapeutics Our mission is to revolutionize medicine, with the ultimate goal of eliminating human suffering and enabling people to live without the burden of disease. Kriya is a biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies to address common diseases affecting millions of people around the world. With operations in Palo Alto, California and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, Kriya has raised over $600 million, which will be used to advance a broad pipeline of gene therapies for ophthalmology, metabolic disease, and neurology.

    "text": "Teaching unions will ballot their members over industrial action after the Easter break unless “a demonstrable step forward is made in addressing the unfair and unsustainable levels of workload for Scotland’s teachers”.\nThe teachers’ panel of the tripartite Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) - which sets terms and conditions for teachers - has written to first minister John Swinney calling for progress on the SNP pledge to cut class-contact time by 90 minutes a week.\nThe unions that make up the teachers’ panel say they have shown “immense patience” but are issuing the warning because of the “complete lack of progress”.\nThey also take issue with councils’ umbrella body Cosla for “equivocating” over how the non-contact time would be used - if and when it is delivered - and claim they are being “shut out of negotiations”.\nPressure to cut teacher workload The unions say they have been excluded from a working group focused on implementing the pledge in a move that “fundamentally undermines the constitution of the SNCT, its commitment to collegiality and the collective bargaining arrangements that have existed for Scotland’s teachers for over two decades”.\nThe letter from SNCT joint chair Des Morris warns that if the issues raised cannot be resolved “then it is highly likely” that unions in the SNCT teachers’ panel “will ballot for industrial action following the Easter break”.\nThe SNP committed to cutting teacher class-contact time by 90 minutes a week in its 2021 Scottish Parliament election manifesto.\nBut progress on delivering the pledge has been described as “glacial” by the teaching unions and in February a formal dispute was declared.\nSeamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association, told Tes Scotland that “teachers are on their knees” and that the reduction in workload promised via the contact-time pledge was “urgently required if we wish to stop the exodus of teachers from the classroom”.\nHe said: “To add to the frustration a working group has been established that deliberately excludes the teacher unions, and we can only assume this is a mechanism to further delay any progress.”\n‘Meaningful progress’ promised In an exclusive interview with Tes Scotland published yesterday to mark two years as education secretary, Jenny Gilruth said that she wanted to make “ meaningful progress” on reducing class-contact time by the 2026 Scottish Parliament election - but could not give a definition of what she meant by “meaningful”.\nShe said that “scoping work” was underway to deliver the reduction, with senior government and local authority officials working on “scenario planning”.\nHowever, in his letter to Mr Swinney, Mr Morris argues that the “remit of this group goes far beyond the ‘scoping work’”.\nHe says that in reality two sides of the SNCT - the government and councils - are “engaged in negotiation of matters relating to the terms and conditions of teachers, but with teacher trade unions excluded from the group”.\nThere is also disagreement over how the extra non-contact time should be used by teachers, with unions arguing that it should go entirely towards preparation and correction - and not more towards “collegiate” activities, as has been suggested by school leaders.\nFor the latest in Scottish education delivered directly to your inbox, sign up for Tes’ The Week in Scotland newsletter\nWant to keep reading for free?

    "text": "There’e big dollars flowing into Big D.\nDallas has emerged as a new financial mecca, trailing only New York in number of finance workers as Wall Street firms seek out lower-cost leases and cheaper workers.\nDallas-Fort Worth, now the country’s fourth-largest metro, has surpassed Chicago and Los Angeles during the pandemic to become the No. 2 place to nab a finance job, according to Bloomberg.\nThree of New York City’s biggest banks — Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Bank of America — have plans to expand their footprint in Texas’ largest city Dallas in hopes of capitalizing on the influx of people that moved to one of the fast-growing states during the pandemic in search.\nThe cost of living is about 40% less than it is in New York, according to Salary.com, thus bringing down the salaries needed to satisfy workers.\nFinancial and investment analysts, for example, average $102,000 a year in Dallas, per Bloomberg, almost 30% less than the going rate in New York.\nAverage salaries also tend to run lower because of the types of jobs available in Texas, where a greater portion of the employee base is made up of back-office operations like engineering, customer service and loan processing, the outlet reported.\nHigh-profile examples of the bet on Dallas include Goldman Sachs, which broke ground on a three-building, 5,000-person campus in trendy Victory Park neighborhood just outside of downtown Dallas in October.\n6\nDallas-Fort Worth, now the country’s fourth-largest metro, has surpassed Chicago and Los Angeles during the pandemic to become the No. 2 place to nab a finance job, only beat by New York in number of finance workers. REUTERS\nThe nearly $500 million, 815,000-square-foot development was made possible with the $18 million in tax breaks the city of Dallas granted the Wall Street bank last July in exchange for bringing as many as 5,000 jobs into the city.\nWhen the campus opens in 2027, staffers can expect to enjoy underground parking, a first-floor retail space, a 1.5-acre urban park, a hotel and residential towers, documents filed with Dallas’ city plan commission showed.\nWhen The Post sought comment from Goldman, a company spokesperson pointed to chief operating officer John Waldron’s comments at the ceremony, when he called the city of Dallas “a hub for talent, innovation and opportunity.”\nWaldron also noted that its Dallas digs would mark the bank’s “second-largest office in the Americas, outside of New York City, our global headquarters.”\nWells Fargo, which has long had a foothold in Texas, is about to increase it with a glittering $500 million campus for as many as 3,000 workers in the suburb of Irving, roughly 12 miles outside of Dallas, according to Bloomberg.\nThe bank received more than $30 million in tax breaks to construct the 850,000-square-foot North Texas hub, which consists of two buildings and a 4,000-space garage that’s set to open by the end of 2026.\nAnd last month, the second-largest US bank by asset size, Bank of America, held a groundbreaking ceremony for the 30-story high-rise that will be erected less than a mile from Goldman’s forthcoming Dallas headquarters.\n6\nGoldman Sachs is set to open a three-building, 5,000-person campus in Texas’ trendy Victoria Park neighborhood in 2027. Once open, the complex will boast a retail space, urban park, hotel and residential tower. Goldman Sachs\n6\nGoldman’s nearly $500 million, 815,000-square-foot development was made possible with the $18 million in tax breaks the city of Dallas granted the Wall Street bank last July. Goldman Sachs\nJennifer Chandler, the market president for Bank of America in Dallas, touted the benefits of being located in the middle of the country.\n“We obviously love the central location,” Chandler told Bloomberg. “It’s very easy to get to and the quality of living is strong,” she added, noting the region’s two airports and 14,000 Dallas-based workers.\nThe Dallas-Forth Worth area is now home to more than 380,000 people who work in the industry, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIt remains well behind New York, the No. 1 finance job hotspot with 809,000 people employed in the industry.\nFinance firms now occupy 28 million square feet of office space in the Dallas area, second behind New York, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Cushman and Wakefield.\n6\nGoldman COO and president John Waldron (fourth from left) attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the bank’s Dallas development in October. Goldman Sachs\n6\nWells Fargo is increasing its footprint in Texas with a glittering $500 million campus for as many as 3,000 workers in the suburb of Irving, roughly 12 miles outside of Dallas, that’s slated to open by the end of 2026. Corgan\nSmaller financial firms that have made the move south include Charles Schwab, which officially re-designated its headquarters from San Francisco to Westlake, Texas — roughly 32 miles from Dallas — after it acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020.\nThe firm — which oversees more than $7 trillion in assets — opened a 1.1 million-square-foot campus that was more than three years and $100 million in the making, with amenities that include a “café, training center, multiple collaboration spaces, employee services and more,” according to the investment firm’s website.\n6\nWells Fargo’s 850,000-square-foot North Texas hub is expected to consist of two buildings and a 4,000-space garage. Corgan\nA year later, $24 billion Los Angeles-based fund Canyon Partners opened a Dallas office, and Atalaya Capital Management — a $10 billion investment advisory firm — followed suit in 2022, marking the opening of its only post outside of NYC.\n“Covid gave everyone an appreciation for what you can do remotely,” said Atalaya founder Ivan Zinn told Bloomberg. “With the growth of asset management, hedge funds, in Dallas in particular, you’ve seen that talent pool diffuse.”",

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service.\nMichael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2.\nLaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it.\n“The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.”\nHe completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs.\nChris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring.\n“Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said.\nAs LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced.\n“Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.
