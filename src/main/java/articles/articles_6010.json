    "title": "Big Abortion is Spending Millions Trying to Elect Kamala Harris - LifeNews.com",
    "text": "Journalists across the political spectrum regret that interviews with Kamala Harris shed precious little light on her views or the policies she intends to implement if elected president. However, some of society’s most noxious forces — including abortionists, those who support transgender surgeries for minors, and pornographers — plan to shape the direction of a Harris-Walz administration and have donated more than $100 million dollars to ensure the pair take power next January.\nAbortionists The abortion industry alone has dedicated tens of millions of dollars to its business interests, and candidates who support them, in the 2024 election. The nation’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, dedicated $40 million to promoting pro-abortion candidates in eight swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n“Abortion will be the message of this election, and it will be how we energize voters,” enthused Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. Lawson said her message would highlight the alleged “devastation that comes when anti-abortion politicians have power” — a theme the Democratic ticket has adopted with relish. Kamala Harris has falsely accused “Trump abortion bans” of claiming the lives of women who died as a result of complications from the abortion pill, mifepristone.\nREACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE! Advertise with LifeNews to reach hundreds of thousands of pro-life readers every week. Contact us today .\nOne of the nation’s most influential pro-abortion PACs, EMILY’s List, amplified this message with a fearmongering $6 million ad buy telling female voters in swing states that lifesaving laws will kill them. The group’s first ad features someone dressed as an emergency room doctor claiming “a pregnant patient” comes in “every shift” bleeding. But “it’s against state law for me to provide life-saving care, because Donald Trump took away a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions,” she lies. No pro-life law at any level makes it illegal to care for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, nor forces women to wait until they are at the point of death to receive medical treatment.\nThe abortion industry has banded together with the legal Left to launch an enduring, $100 million campaign under the new name Abortion Access Now (AAN). AAN describes itself as “a long-term federal strategy to codify the right to abortion, including lobbying efforts, grassroots organizing, public education, and comprehensive communication strategies to mobilize support and enact change.” Its leadership includes:\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) Reproductive Freedom for All American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice (Latina Institute) National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF) Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE) Its steering committee also includes the oxymoronic, dissenting group Catholics for Choice, as well as EMILY’s List, the National Abortion Federation, MoveOn.org, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the National Council of Jewish Women, and the National Abortion Hotline.\nMany of these groups worked in concert to support Ohio’s Issue 1 , which wrote the “right” of minors to obtain abortion and other “reproductive” services into the state constitution last November. The groups support abortion for minors without parental consent or notification, transgender surgeries for minors, legalizing prostitution, hampering law enforcement, and forcing taxpayers to fund abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy.\nAbortion Access Now’s opening statement signals that it, too, aims at far more than simply abortion. “We envision a future where abortion, and all sexual and reproductive health care, is not only legal but also accessible, affordable, and free from stigma or fear,” the group said in a press release announcing its formation in June. “We are operating with a really big vision, but we’re also living in the world of the possible,” Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, told Politico.\nFor the short term, the group intends to fund abortion through Medicaid and other federal programs, expand the “right” of taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand to illegal immigrants and other pregnant “people in federal custody facilities,” and corporate welfare for abortionists to rebuild “ the abortion care ecosystem .” Its statement also hinted at the abortion industry’s fear-based misinformation strategy, alleging, “People are struggling to get lifesaving medical care for miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and other pregnancy complications.”\nPlanned Parenthood state affiliates in California, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio will also launch localized campaigns on the issue, many focused at the state level. A total of 10 states will host ballot initiatives on abortion this November. But ultimately, Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson vowed that her industry will use all the resources at its disposal to “fight for federal” pro-abortion legislation.\nSBA Pro-Life America has announced it will spend $92 million in eight swing states, including Michigan, this election cycle aiding those who respect the unalienable right to life.\nPornographers The New York Times reported that the “ porn industry ” — whose products often feature incest, rape, violence, and themes of pedophilia — has thrown its support behind Kamala Harris in 2024. The industry launched a $100,000 “Hands Off My Porn” campaign , running anti-Trump ads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. The advertisements accuse the former president of secretly seeking to implement provisions of Project 2025, a conservative policy document he has repeatedly disowned, which would harm the smut industry’s bottom line.\nThe porn industry has a long history of endorsing Democratic candidates, and the party seemingly looks out for its interests, as well. The 2024 Democratic Party platform promises to keep “fighting” parents who want to place sexually graphic books in age-restricted parts of the library and ensure schools are not promoting such content to their children. The Democratic platform refers to these parental modesty initiatives as “book bans that censor LGBTQI+ content.” Both Kamala Harris and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz (D), who has a long history with the LGBTQ movement, have said they oppose efforts to spare minors from exposure to porn in schools.\nGroups That Support Transgender Surgeries for Children The nation’s leading LGBTQIA+ pressure group, the controversial Human Rights Campaign (HRC), has dedicated $15 million to the 2024 presidential election. As this author has written at The Washington Stand, HRC opposes laws protecting minors from transgender procedures and surgeries, and its controversial K-12 curriculum encourages employees to teach children radical transgender ideology beginning in preschool:\n“HRC’s ‘Welcoming Schools’ program instructs teachers to read the book ‘ They, She, He, Easy as ABC ’ to children in preschool or kindergarten. Its pre-K lesson plan defines ‘gender identity’ as ‘How you feel. Girl, boy, both or neither. Everyone has a gender identity,’ conducts school trainings , and creates lesson plans for teachers beginning in ‘ pre-K .’ By third grade, it encourages students to use the ‘ Gender Snowperson ’ exercise to ‘understand the differences between gender identity, sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth.’”\n“The HRC, an LGBT activist group with a $46 million budget, opposes laws protecting minors from transgender procedures and has denounced laws ‘allowing misgendering of transgender students’ or regulating ‘drag performances.’”\nHRC is joined by the so-called Equality PAC, which is co-chaired by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), which has raised $12 million for the 2024 election.\n“Welcome to our annual convening of the gay mafia,” Torres told the group’s star-studded fundraiser in June. “Vice President Harris, some of you from California may remember that she began marrying gay couples when she was the DA in San Francisco — before gay marriage was even legal across the country,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) told the crowd.\nThe group has raised so much money that it has branched out from supporting candidates who identify as LGBT to spreading LGBTQIA+ activists’ money throughout Democratic congressional campaigns broadly. “We recognize that without a pro-equality Congress, without a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, we will never be able to make the Equality Act the law of the land,” said Torres. Besides, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told the group a future Democratic majority could “pull back” the Senate filibuster to pass the so-called “Equality Act” with a bare majority.\nA new Democratic Congress may have a much stronger ally in the White House next January. In all, the movement aims to “build a world where it’s no longer noteworthy when a trans candidate runs and wins,” insisted a Democratic Delaware state senator born Tim McBride , who now goes by the name Sarah.\nTorres linked the LGBTQIA+ cause with abortion-on-demand, telling NPR, “A woman born in 2024 has fewer rights than she did in 1973, which is a tragic reminder that progress cannot be taken for granted, that LGBTQ rights can be every bit as fragile as reproductive rights.”\nA poll from the LGBTQ pressure group GLAAD found that those who identify with the movement favor any generic Democrat over any generic Republican by 63 points (77% vs. 14%).\nDr. Jennifer Bauwens has also pointed out at the 2024 Pray Vote Stand Summit that, according to federal election data, “92% to 96% of research psychologists and social workers” have “given to a liberal Democrat candidate” for office.\nResearchers have found politicians prove remarkably responsive to people or organizations who donate to their campaign. Rest assured that if Kamala Harris is elected, pornographers, abortionists, and the transgender industry will have her ear.\nLifeNews Note: Ben Johnson is senior reporter and editor at The Washington Stand.",

    "text": "Felipe Caicedo es esperado en Guayaquil.\nPateando Tachos: Si amas al fútbol, quieres a Felipe Caicedo\nOpinión: Hace lo que corresponde, cuando distrae por fuera y define por dentro, la marca se desvanece como el atardecer.\nLa memoria es identidad. La derrota ablanda el argumento. Un ariete es rehén de detalles.\nCuando Felipe Caicedo encara mano a mano, el primer movimiento debe hacerlo él, ya que una vez que el rival hace el primer desplazamiento, y no logró robarle la pelota, no podrá recuperarse.\nEn el primer giro del ariete, la debe sacar de su arco. Un nueve, si de 90 minutos juega 80’ de espaldas al arco, no sabe actuar. Y es que no se conoce atacante que haga goles de espaldas al arco. Si corre por correr, no es eficaz; tiene dificultad de definición y rotación.\nEl problema no es correr más, sino saber correr; si el jugador no está adaptado a la forma de juego del equipo, por más que corra no logrará ser eficaz. Será indefenso e incomprendido.\nFelipao hace lo que corresponde: cuando distrae por fuera y define por dentro, la marca se desvanece como el atardecer. Se toma libertades dentro de los automatismos.\nLa obligación del entrenador es llevar el balón 70 metros, los 30 finales depende de la inventiva del atacante, conseguir efectividad en el lugar más difícil del campo que es el área. Si el atacante decide mal es porque no comprende cuál es la mejor opción.\nUn jugador durante 90 minutos se pasa tomando decisiones. Si las decisiones las toma un compañero por él, ¿cómo podrá decidir después?.\nSiga leyendo: (Serie C en Ecuador: Clubes insisten a FEF que considere la propuesta en el congreso)\nEl menor porcentaje de actividad en el cerebro se da en la rutina, en repetir siempre las mismas cosas. El cerebro no se vuelve creativo cuando le dan todas las respuestas.\nLos verdaderos maestros del área como Felipao no enseñan nada a nadie, sino que orientan, ayudan a descubrir y a pensar a los demás. Ahí es donde él en definición es inigualable; no le da un segundo de oxígeno al defensor.\nEl conocimiento del juego está en la intención y no solo en la acción. Un crack elige a sus complementos por sus virtudes, no por su falta de defectos.\nFelipao es reverente y desafiante. Copado de astucia y buenos reflejos. Nada de energía alocada y frenética. ¡Qué importa coincidir con el personaje dogmático!. Importa el espectáculo prodigioso de sus goles. Tiempo de decir que sobran los dedos de una mano a la hora de nombrar a los habitantes de la cancha que pueden merecer al lado de sus nombres la palabra crack. Felipe es uno de esos, uno de los pocos que no le queda grande el traje de esa bendita palabra. La grandeza es parte importante de su identidad.\nLa única verdad en el fútbol es que no la tiene nadie. Si amas al fútbol, quieres a Felipao; si amas a un equipo que no es Barcelona SC, es difícil querer a Felipao.\nPara seguir leyendo contenido de calidad, ¡SUSCRÍBETE A EXPRESO!",

China ha realizado inversiones masivas para modernizar sus fuerzas armadas, destacándose en áreas como misiles hipersónicos, capacidades espaciales, vehículos autónomos y guerra cibernética.\nLa reciente aparición de dos aviones de sexta generación de fabricación china ha generado una ola de preocupación entre los analistas militares de Estados Unidos, quienes advierten sobre la necesidad de acelerar el desarrollo de su programa NGAD (Next Generation Air Dominance).\nChina lanzaría dos aviones de sexta generación de fabricación. Foto: Meta Defense\nPUEDES VER:\n[Taiwán despliega su poderío naval ante posible ataque de China mientras continúa en aumento tensiones]\nChina podría superar la fuerza militar de Estados Unidos\nEste avance tecnológico por parte de China podría marcar un punto de inflexión en la balanza de poder militar global. Los expertos subrayan que la capacidad de China para desarrollar aeronaves avanzadas pone en riesgo la superioridad aérea que Estados Unidos ha mantenido durante décadas.\nLa situación actual ha llevado a un llamado urgente para que el gobierno estadounidense priorice la inversión en tecnología militar y modernice su flota aérea, a fin de no quedar rezagado frente a las innovaciones chinas.\n¿Cuáles son los aviones de caza que desplegaría China para consolidar su poderío militar?\nAunque Pekín aún no ha confirmado oficialmente el hecho, los militares del Mando del Teatro Oriental del Ejército Popular de Liberación han dado una confirmación indirecta sobre el primer vuelo de los cazas avanzados. Esto se debe a que compartieron en sus redes sociales un vídeo musical de Año Nuevo que mostraba una imagen de una hoja de ginkgo, un símbolo muy parecido al diseño de uno de los nuevos reactores.\nLos analistas creen que el primero de estos cazas en ser revelado, el conocido Chengdu J-36, presenta una serie de avances tecnológicos significativos. El J-36 es visto como una posible contrapartida del programa estadounidense Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), el cual actualmente está en pausa debido a las dudas del Pentágono sobre si sus características son las más adecuadas para la guerra aérea moderna.",

    "text": "2025年4月22日，湖北 华强科技 股份有限公司（以下简称“华强科技”）发布2024年年度报告。报告期内，公司实现营业收入61,134.81万元，同比增长6.74%；归属于上市公司股东的净利润为2,252.79万元，同比大增184.26%。然而，公司经营活动产生的现金流量净额为净流出13,775.11万元，净流出同比增加105.98%，同时面临着市场、技术等多方面风险。以下将对该公司年报进行详细解读。\n关键财务指标分析\n营收增长得益于业务板块拓展\n华强科技2024年实现营业收入61,134.81万元，同比增长6.74%。从业务板块来看，军品主营业务收入18,967.55万元，同比增长14.56%，主要系集体防护产品收入增加；医药包装主营业务收入39,568.87万元，同口径同比增长3.11%，其中胶塞收入33,486.92万元，同比增长0.78%；共挤膜收入3,769.03万元，同比增长25.14%；铝塑制品收入2,312.92万元，同比增长12.86%。公司通过积极开拓市场、推进产品结构调整，在各业务板块均取得了一定成效，推动了营收增长。\n业务板块 营业收入（万元） 同比增减（%） 特种防护装备 18,967.55 14.56 医药包装及医疗器械 39,568.87 -0.60（同口径3.11） 净利润大幅提升但扣非后仍亏损\n归属于上市公司股东的净利润为2,252.79万元，同比增加184.26%。不过，归属于上市公司股东的扣除非经常性损益的净利润为 -6,495.81万元，虽同比增加14.56%，但仍处于亏损状态。净利润增加主要源于特种防护装备产品及研发服务类收入和毛利率同比增加，以及减值损失同比减少。这表明公司在核心业务盈利能力提升和成本控制方面取得进展，但非经常性损益对净利润影响较大，扣除非经常性损益后的亏损情况反映出公司主营业务的可持续盈利能力仍需加强。\n指标 2024年（万元） 2023年（万元） 同比增减（%） 归属于上市公司股东的净利润 2,252.79 792.51 184.26 归属于上市公司股东的扣除非经常性损益的净利润 -6,495.81 -7,602.74 14.56 基本每股收益显著增长\n基本每股收益为0.07元/股，同比增长250.00%，主要得益于净利润的大幅增长。这一增长提升了股东的每股收益水平，但结合扣非净利润亏损情况，投资者仍需关注公司盈利的可持续性。\n年份 基本每股收益（元/股） 同比增减（%） 2024年 0.07 250.00 2023年 0.02 - 费用分析\n销售费用增长明显\n销售费用为31,655,177.86元，同比增加35.22%。主要原因是部门职责调整及发放本年绩效奖励。这一增长反映出公司在市场拓展方面加大了投入，旨在提升产品销售业绩，但需关注费用增长是否能有效转化为销售收入的持续增长。\n年份 销售费用（元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 31,655,177.86 35.22 2023年 23,410,421.75 - 管理费用有所上升\n管理费用为102,357,399.53元，同比增长9.61%。增长原因可能与公司业务规模扩大，相应的管理成本增加有关。公司需进一步优化管理流程，控制管理费用的合理增长。\n年份 管理费用（元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 102,357,399.53 9.61 2023年 93,379,355.87 - 财务费用由负转正且收益减少\n财务费用为 -16,313,851.58元，实现收益同比减少43.25%。主要原因是本期闲置货币资金主要购买结构性存款，收益计入投资收益。尽管财务费用为负，显示公司在资金管理上有一定收益，但收益的减少可能影响公司整体的财务收益水平。\n年份 财务费用（元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 -16,313,851.58 不适用（收益同比减少43.25%） 2023年 -28,748,971.71 - 研发费用持续投入\n研发费用为56,601,150.01元，同比增长9.38%。研发投入占营业收入的比例为9.26%，同比增加0.23个百分点。公司持续投入研发，有助于提升产品竞争力和创新能力，符合公司长期发展战略，但需关注研发成果的转化效率。\n年份 研发费用（元） 同比增减（%） 研发投入占营业收入比例（%） 2024年 56,601,150.01 9.38 9.26 2023年 51,745,889.67 - 9.03 现金流分析\n经营活动现金流量净额净流出扩大\n经营活动产生的现金流量净额为净流出13,775.11万元，净流出同比增加105.98%，主要系原材料采购支出同比增加所致。这表明公司在经营过程中，现金流出压力增大，可能对公司的资金周转和运营产生一定影响，需关注公司对原材料采购的规划与资金安排。\n年份 经营活动产生的现金流量净额（万元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 -13,775.11 105.98（净流出增加） 2023年 -6,687.60 - 投资活动现金流量净额由负转正\n投资活动产生的现金流量净额为净流入27,035.46万元，净流入同比增加137.44%，主要系结构性存款到期收回所致。这显示公司在投资活动方面，资金回笼情况良好，有助于改善公司的资金状况。\n年份 投资活动产生的现金流量净额（万元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 27,035.46 137.44（净流入增加） 2023年 -72,217.15 - 筹资活动现金流量净额净流出减少\n筹资活动产生的现金流量净额为净流出1,022.54万元，净流出同比减少60.83%，主要系分配现金股利同比减少所致。这表明公司在筹资活动方面，现金流出压力有所缓解，资金安排相对合理。\n年份 筹资活动产生的现金流量净额（万元） 同比增减（%） 2024年 -1,022.54 60.83（净流出减少） 2023年 -2,610.47 - 风险分析\n市场风险\n军品订单波动风险 ：特种防护装备订单受国际形势、国防战略及军方采购需求变化影响大。若军费支出预算调整、采购计划改变或周期延长，公司可能面临订单延迟或取消，导致军品销售收入下滑，影响经营业绩和盈利能力。 医药包装市场风险 ：医药包装产品原材料部分依赖进口，外贸环境变化或国际政治关系紧张，可能导致原材料供应不足或价格波动，影响公司生产经营与成本控制。同时，国家带量采购政策下，下游药企若未通过一致性评价或中标，将减少对药用胶塞的需求，影响公司业绩。 技术风险\n研发风险 ：为保持行业地位，公司持续投入研发。但新产品研发周期长，若技术升级迭代不能满足客户需求，或行业出现重大技术变革、研发失败，公司可能失去技术优势，产品被替代，面临订单减少或不被认可的风险。 竞争风险 ：药用胶塞行业竞争激烈，外资品牌及国内优质企业可能通过技术创新、降价等方式抢占市场，导致市场供应结构和价格体系变化，对公司经营造成不利影响。 高管薪酬分析\n董事长薪酬情况\n董事长孙光幸报告期内从公司获得的税前报酬总额为71.13万元。董事长作为公司的核心领导，其薪酬水平与公司的经营业绩和发展战略密切相关。\n总经理薪酬情况\n总经理刘榜劳报告期内从公司获得的税前报酬总额为57.05万元。总经理负责公司日常运营管理，其薪酬体现了对其管理工作的回报。\n副总经理薪酬情况\n多位副总经理报告期内从公司获得的税前报酬总额有所差异，如陈德安为51.65万元、周超为57.03万元、唐国庆为57.03万元、刘波为57.03万元。副总经理们在各自分管领域为公司发展贡献力量，薪酬也反映了其职责与贡献。\n财务总监薪酬情况\n总会计师、总法律顾问孙岩报告期内从公司获得的税前报酬总额为57.03万元。财务总监负责公司财务管理与法律事务，薪酬水平与岗位重要性相匹配。\n总体来看，华强科技在2024年虽营收和净利润实现增长，但经营活动现金流量净额的恶化以及面临的多种风险值得关注。投资者在决策时，需综合考虑公司的财务状况、市场环境和风险因素，谨慎做出判断。\n声明 ：市场有风险，投资需谨慎。 本文为AI大模型基于第三方数据库自动发布，任何在本文出现的信息（包括但不限于个股、评论、预测、图表、指标、理论、任何形式的表述等）均只作为参考，不构成个人投资建议。受限于第三方数据库质量等问题，我们无法对数据的真实性及完整性进行分辨或核验，因此本文内容可能出现不准确、不完整、误导性的内容或信息，具体以公司公告为准。如有疑问，请联系biz@staff.sina.com.cn。",

    "title": "7 of the Best Lab-Grown Diamond Rings of 2024",
    "text": "It’s proposal season, the perfect time to present a diamond ring to your partner and pledge your loyalty and commitment. While diamonds come in all shapes and sizes, there is a new and better way to purchase yours: lab-grown diamonds. In this blog post, we’ll explain the benefits of lab-grown diamond rings vs. natural diamonds. We’ll also provide tips on how to spot quality lab-created diamonds, where to find the best lab-grown diamond rings for engagements, and explain whether lab grown are real diamonds. Are they?! I was curious about the answer myself, so I did my research! In this blog post, we’ll identify the top\nlab-grown engagement rings with suggestions on what styles and shapes are trending.\nBut first, let’s talk about sparkle. The brilliance and sparkle of lab-grown vs. natural diamonds is similar to the eye; unless you have heavy magnification and are an expert jeweler, you likely won’t be able to tell the difference between the two. Here are some of the best lab-grown diamond rings, rated with high reviews and accolades in their categories, by one of the experts in the industry:\nBen Garelick.\nLet’s get started: you have a proposal to plan! :)\nBest Princess-Cut:\nAstra\nGo with this timeless and interstellar style featuring a 2-carat princess-cut diamond on an artistic setting that features meticulous milgrain detailing. It is the perfect ring for your timeless love story.\nastra astra\nBest Twist:\nAriel\nLove a twist design?

Anyone can tell you to purchase lab-grown vs. mined, but what are the actual reasons why couples are going wild over this alternative? Here are three major reasons why lab-grown rings are the best option when choosing a diamond.\n1. Affordability\nMany favor lab-grown jewelry simply due to the affordability factor. Lab-grown diamonds are less expensive than mined diamonds. Since they can be produced in large batches in a short period of time, lab-grown are considerably less expensive than natural diamonds.\n2. Ethical and Conflict-Free\nOne major reason couples turn to an alternative to mined diamonds is simple: they’re ethical, eco-friendly, and conflict-free.\n3. Brilliance of Lab Grown vs. Natural Diamonds\nOne major reason why couples are looking to buy lab-grown diamonds for engagements is that most people cannot tell the difference. No one can tell the difference because they are both diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are the best option when choosing a diamond ring if you want to purchase a diamond that shines just as bright as a natural one.\nTo the untrained eye, you will not likely be able to tell the difference between the two. Can a lab-grown diamond pass a diamond tester? Likely, an expert jeweler may be able to tell the difference between these two kinds of diamonds based on special inclusions under high magnification. They have different types of inclusions that occur when the diamond is created. However, as mentioned, most won’t be able to look at your diamond and tell it’s lab-created; it is just as sparkly and brilliant. No one will be able to tell, since both options are true diamonds.\nAre Lab-Grown Diamonds Real Diamonds?\nYes. According to diamond expert\nhttps://www.bengarelick.com/collections/lab-grown-complete-diamond-engagement-rings, lab diamonds are, in fact, real diamonds. “From breathtaking engagement rings to stunning necklaces and earrings, our complete collection features an array of exquisite designs, expertly crafted to showcase the extraordinary beauty of lab-grown diamonds. Embrace a future-forward choice that celebrates love and supports sustainability with Ben Garelick’s lab-grown diamond collection.”\nAre Lab-Grown the Same as Simulation Diamonds?\nNo. It’s important to note that lab-grown diamonds are NOT the same as simulated diamonds. Simulants to diamond rings — like cubic zirconia and moissanite — have a different chemical makeup and composition when compared to a diamond. So, don’t search for simulated and think you’re getting lab-grown diamond rings: they are made entirely differently.\nLab-Grown diamonds are diamonds, they are just made by humans instead of mother nature. Focus on the 4 C’s when you shop: cut, color, clarity, and carat are just as important on lab-grown diamonds as mined diamonds.\nHow to Spot Quality Lab-Grown Diamond Rings\nThe best way to spot quality diamond rings that are lab-grown is to find a retailer that is reputable (read reviews online!), offers a vast collection of lab-grown diamond rings and NOT simulated diamonds, and also has independent GIA certification on your ring when you order it. This is important: you want to have a ring with certification, whether you buy lab-grown or natural diamonds.\nAs shown on this list, lab-grown diamond rings offer many benefits vs. natural earth-mined diamonds. You are expressing your love and commitment, so you should always choose the best ring that is right for you. Whether that is lab-grown or natural, you’ll find plenty of options to suit your needs.\nFor more on lab-grown diamonds and how they’re made,\nread this guide.\n► Now that you know more about lab-grown vs. natural diamonds and their benefits, let’s go shopping! You can build your own ring starting with a lab-created diamond\nhere. It’s easy and completely customizable.\nThis is a partnered post.",

    "title": "Hurricane Helene may have spread invasive critters in Georgia | Weather News | ArcaMax Publishing",
    "text": "The devastating toll Hurricane Helene inflicted on Georgia this fall will be felt for years in hard hit parts of the state. The storm caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage to the state’s agriculture and forestry sectors, plus billions more in property losses — and claimed at least 33 lives.\nBut death and destruction may not be all Helene left behind: New federal projections show the storm might have helped spread invasive species, too.\nAn analysis released this week by the U.S. Geological Survey shows Hurricane Helene may have allowed as many as 222 nonnative and invasive species to infiltrate farther into parts of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and even deep into the Appalachian Mountains. Of those, 90 are considered invasive, meaning their potential introduction to new territory could threaten human health, the environment and the economy.\nHurricane Milton, which slammed Florida as a Category 3 storm about two weeks after Helene, may have dispersed unwanted critters of its own. The USGS’ early projections show the storm could have spread roughly 114 species, including 56 invasives. Most of Milton’s spread likely occurred on the Florida Peninsula, but rain from the storm that stretched into southeast Georgia could have allowed unwanted plants and creatures to expand their range there, too.\nThe agency did not analyze the effects of Hurricane Debby, which brought heavy flooding to Georgia and the Carolinas in August, though over a much smaller area.\nUSGS started conducting these surveys after major storms following Hurricane Harvey, which triggered historic flooding in the Houston area in 2017. The researchers rely on a mix of stream and river gauge readings, topographical data and information on the known presence of species to make their projections.\nHurricane Helene made landfall in late September in Florida’s Big Bend Region as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, ranking as one of the strongest storms on record to hit the U.S. Helene’s powerful winds mangled structures, crops and timber stocks across Georgia, but the inland flooding it unleashed — especially in the Carolinas and Tennessee — was to blame for the most severe damage.\nThose same floodwaters may have provided avenues for invasives to spread, particularly aquatic species, said Ian Pfingsten, a USGS botanist who contributed to the analyses for Helene and Milton. An estimated 100 species had the potential to spread in Georgia via flooding or swollen waterways caused by the storms, Pfingsten said.\n“We’re dealing with species that can not only float and disperse, like plants and mollusks, but also a lot of fish that will actively swim through the floodwaters,” he said.\nAmong the most concerning species that may have capitalized on the temporary travel corridors in Georgia are the Asian swamp eel, the giant applesnail and the cane toad.\nAsian swamp eels, Monopterus albus, are native to India, Myanmar, China and other pockets of Asia but were introduced into ponds around the Chattahoochee Nature Center in Roswell in the mid-1990s, likely after being dumped from a home aquarium. The species has since proliferated in the Chattahoochee River Basin, particularly around Atlanta.\nAtlanta saw record rainfall and major flooding during Helene, especially along tributaries of the Chattahoochee, and USGS experts said the high water could have given the eels an opportunity to venture downstream. Asian swamp eels are known to harbor dangerous parasites that can harm humans and other animals.\n Giant applesnails, Pomacea maculata, might have also benefited from the storms. Native to the Amazon River basin and other parts of South America, the giant snails are already found in many Georgia waterways, including the Upper Chattahoochee River, the Lower Flint River and many more across South Georgia.\nThe snails are typically tan-brown or yellow and black with striped patterns, but are best distinguished by the wide opening to their shell. Applesnails are a known agricultural pest and, like eels, carry dangerous nematodes capable of causing serious illness in humans.\nThen there’s the cane toad, Rhinella marina, an enormous, wart-covered amphibian native to South America.\nThe toads, which can weigh as much as 3 pounds, are already established in Florida and pockets of the Gulf Coast. Cane toads pack glands containing a toxic secretion that can poison dogs, cats and even people who come into contact with it.\nGeorgia wildlife officials say there have been sporadic cane toad sightings in the state before, but no breeding populations have been confirmed. USGS experts said there are no indications for now the hurricanes brought more of the pests to Georgia, but it could have been possible for tadpoles to hitch a ride in floodwaters.\nGeorgia already has its share of destructive invasive species.\nJust weeks ago, state agriculture officials confirmed the spotted lanternfly, an invasive fly known for its stinky and destructive secretions, has been found in the state, but its arrival is likely unrelated to the hurricanes.\nStill, Georgia officials said they are keeping their eyes open — and have asked the public to do the same.\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Agriculture said the agency has not seen an uptick in invasives after past storms but encouraged Georgians to remain vigilant if they see unusual plants, insects or animals. The public can report potential sightings, adding that it is “vital” that photos or specimens themselves are captured, if it’s safe to do so.\nThe Georgia Department of Natural Resources said it is aware that storms can help spread invasive species, but so far, staff contacted had not confirmed any new cases linked to hurricane season.",
