    "text": "Vidente prevê ano estressante para Meghan em 2024: “dor de cabeça” Segundo o vidente londrino Nicolas Aujula, outro “escândalo” está no horizonte para a realeza atualizado Compartilhar notícia O vidente londrino Nicolas Aujula, que afirma ter previsto corretamente a [pandemia de Covid-19](https://www.metropoles.com/tag/coronavirus) e a [derrota de Trump](https://www.metropoles.com/mundo/politica-int/apos-derrota-nas-eleicoes-trump-participa-de-primeiro-evento-publico) nas presidenciais, revelou o que pode estar reservado para [Meghan Markle](https://www.metropoles.com/tag/meghan-markle) em 2024. Segundo ele, a duquesa de Sussex terá mais um ano estressante pela frente, visto que outro “escândalo” está no horizonte para a [realeza](https://www.metropoles.com/tag/realeza). De acordo com Nicolas, uma “voz interior” o mostrou que a esposa do príncipe Harry experimentará um “elemento de dor de cabeça” no próximo ano. “Não com Harry, mas com alguém próximo a ela”, conforme relatou o jornal britânico Express. O vidente continuou: “Eu sinto com a família real que haverá um vazamento de gravação de voz”. No entanto, o especialista real Mark Boardman falou à edição americana do Express que o casal poderia estar caminhando para coisas melhores em 2024, algo como um “ano de redenção”. “Olhando para um [potencial retorno de Harry e Meghan em Hollywood em 2024](https://www.metropoles.com/colunas/claudia-meireles/meghan-deve-anunciar-retorno-a-hollywood-e-atuar-em-sequencia-de-filme), com acordos multimilionários em vigor para vários livros, propriedade dos direitos de publicação de um romance, além de administrar o Archewell Foundation, os Sussex estão moldando ativamente sua narrativa e certamente não estão esperando que algo aconteça”, opinou. Boardman enfatizou que os últimos 12 meses foram um “ano muito ruim” para eles, [mas que 2024 traz esperança de um ano “mais positivo” pela frente](https://www.metropoles.com/colunas/claudia-meireles/expert-diz-que-harry-e-meghan-vao-ganhar-ainda-mais-dinheiro-em-2024).

    "title": "Check out photos of the Northern Lights last night from skywatchers across Wisconsin",
    "text": "Check out photos of the northern lights last night from skywatchers across Wisconsin Due to a rare, strong geomagnetic storm, aurora borealis may be visible again tonight. The northern lights graced night skies across Wisconsin and the U.S. on Thursday night after an eruption of solar material caused the [NOAA Space Weather Prediction](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october) to issue a [severe geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/10/09/northern-lights-forecast-auroras-might-be-seen-in-wisconsin-thursday/75590287007/). Watches at this level are very rare. Strong geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operation, NOAA says. The watch continues into early Saturday morning, so if you missed the aurora borealis Thursday night, you still may be able to see them Friday night. But, if you can't catch the northern lights either night, you can enjoy these photos taken in Milwaukee and Wisconsin Thursday night. More: [Northern lights could be visible in Wisconsin as part of a 'very rare' solar storm this week](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/10/09/northern-lights-forecast-auroras-might-be-seen-in-wisconsin-thursday/75590287007/) What causes the northern lights? Also known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are [a natural light display in Earth's sky](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/) that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with [molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen](https://www.jsonline.com/story/graphics/2024/05/18/northern-lights-colors-explained/73731506007/), causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the [University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) website, which tracks the phenomenon. As auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. When northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Are the northern lights becoming more common? This isn't the first time this year people throughout Wisconsin caught a glimpse of the northern lights. In May, a [powerful geomagnetic storm](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/) unleashed [spectacular views of the northern lights](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/) in areas of the U.S. where auroras are seldom visible, [including here in Milwaukee](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/05/11/northern-lights-seen-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-last-night/73653382007/). As the [sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/northern-lights-solar-maximum-auroras/75449249007/) in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity. Best places in Wisconsin to see the northern lights Here's a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky: [Newport State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/newport), Ellison Bay[Driftless Region, Wisconsin](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2022/06/28/driftless-region-wisconsin-vernon-county-wants-become-international-dark-sky-park-kickapoo-valley/7487767001/)[Harrington Beach State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/harringtonbeach), Belgium[Kettle Moraine State Forest](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kms), Eagle[Kohler-Andrae State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kohlerandrae), Sheboygan[Parnell Tower](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kmn/recreation/hiking), Plymouth Journal Sentinel reporter Alex Groth contributed to this report.",

    "text": "The State Department said it has ordered the departure of all nonessential personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad based on its latest review and a commitment “to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad.” The embassy already had been on limited staffing, and the order will not affect a large number of personnel.\nThe department, however, also is authorizing the departure of nonessential personnel and family members from Bahrain and Kuwait. That gives them the option of leaving those countries at government expense and with government assistance.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth “has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations” across the region, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. The command “is monitoring the developing tension in the Middle East.”\nSpeaking at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump stated, “They are being moved out, because it could be a dangerous place, and we’ll see what happens. We’ve given notice to move out, and we’ll see what happens.”\nTensions in the region have been rising in recent days as talks between the U.S. and Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program appear to have hit an impasse.\nTrump, who has previously said Israel or the U.S. could carry out airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities if negotiations failed, gave a less-than-optimistic view about reaching a deal with Iran, telling the New York Post’s “Pod Force One” podcast that he was “getting more and more less confident about” a deal.\n“They seem to be delaying, and I think that’s a shame. I’m less confident now than I would have been a couple of months ago. Something happened to them,” he said in the interview recorded Monday and released Wednesday.\nIran’s mission to the U.N. posted on social media that “threats of overwhelming force won’t change the facts.”\n“Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, and U.S. militarism only fuels instability,” the Iranian mission wrote.\nIranian Defense Minister Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh separately told journalists Wednesday that he hoped talks with the U.S. would yield results, though Tehran stood ready to respond.\n“If conflict is imposed on us, the opponent’s casualties will certainly be more than ours, and in that case, America must leave the region, because all its bases are within our reach,” he stressed, adding, “We have access to them, and we will target all of them in the host countries without hesitation.”",

    "text": "Healthcare services company Chemed Corporation (NYSE: CHE) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 9.8% year on year to $646.9 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $5.63 per share was 1.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Chemed? Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free.\nChemed (CHE) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $646.9 million vs analyst estimates of $641.8 million (9.8% year-on-year growth, 0.8% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $5.63 vs analyst estimates of $5.55 (1.5% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $121.7 million vs analyst estimates of $119.9 million (18.8% margin, 1.5% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 14.6%, up from 12.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 3%, down from 12.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $8.47 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a unique business model combining end-of-life care and household services, Chemed (NYSE: CHE) operates two distinct businesses: VITAS, which provides hospice care for terminally ill patients, and Roto-Rooter, which offers plumbing and water restoration services.\nSenior Health, Home Health & Hospice\nThe senior health, home care, and hospice care industries provide essential services to aging populations and patients with chronic or terminal conditions. These companies benefit from stable, recurring revenue driven by relationships with patients and families that can extend many months or even years. However, the labor-intensive nature of the business makes it vulnerable to rising labor costs and staffing shortages, while profitability is constrained by reimbursement rates from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned for tailwinds from an aging population, increasing chronic disease prevalence, and a growing preference for personalized in-home care. Advancements in remote monitoring and telehealth are expected to enhance efficiency and care delivery. However, headwinds such as labor shortages, wage inflation, and regulatory uncertainty around reimbursement could pose challenges. Investments in digitization and technology-driven care will be critical for long-term success.\nSales Growth\nA company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Chemed’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Chemed’s annualized revenue growth of 7.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results.\nThis quarter, Chemed reported year-on-year revenue growth of 9.8%, and its $646.9 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.8%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.2% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is above the sector average and indicates its newer products and services will help maintain its recent top-line performance.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nChemed has managed its cost base well over the last five years. It demonstrated solid profitability for a healthcare business, producing an average operating margin of 16.1%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Chemed’s operating margin decreased by 3.1 percentage points over the last five years. A silver lining is that on a two-year basis, its margin has stabilized. Still, shareholders will want to see Chemed become more profitable in the future.\nIn Q1, Chemed generated an operating profit margin of 14.6%, up 2.4 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\nChemed’s EPS grew at a remarkable 9.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.6% annualized revenue growth. However, this alone doesn’t tell us much about its business quality because its operating margin didn’t expand.\nWe can take a deeper look into Chemed’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. A five-year view shows that Chemed has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 10.6%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings.\nIn Q1, Chemed reported EPS at $5.63, up from $5.20 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 1.5%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Chemed’s full-year EPS of $23.57 to grow 9.6%.\nKey Takeaways from Chemed’s Q1 Results\nIt was good to see Chemed top analysts’ revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. Overall, this quarter had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $590 immediately after reporting.\nIs Chemed an attractive investment opportunity at the current price? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

    "text": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday blocked an Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone emissions that may worsen air pollution in neighboring states, handing a victory to three Republican-led states and the steel and fossil fuel industries that had challenged the rule. The 5-4 decision granted requests by Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia, as well as U.S. Steel, pipeline operator Kinder Morgan and industry groups, to halt enforcement of the EPA's \"Good Neighbor\" plan restricting ozone pollution from upwind states, while they contest the rule's legality in a lower court. The EPA issued the rule in March 2023 intending to target gases that form ozone, a key component of smog, from power plants and other industrial sources in 23 upwind states whose own plans did not satisfy the \"Good Neighbor\" provision of the Clean Air Act anti-pollution law, requiring steps to reduce pollution that drifts into states downwind. The agency said the rule would result in cleaner air for millions of people, saving thousands of lives. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the ruling, said the court is granting the challengers' request because they are likely to ultimately prevail in the litigation, because the FDA did not reasonably explain its actions. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented, joined by the court's three liberal justices. \"The court today enjoins the enforcement of a major Environmental Protection Agency rule based on an underdeveloped theory that is unlikely to succeed on the merits,\" Barrett wrote. The challenge followed a major 2022 ruling powered by the Supreme Court's conservative majority imposing limits on the EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce coal- and gas-fired power plant carbon emissions, undermining President Joe Biden's plans to tackle climate change. The court last year also hobbled the EPA's power to protect wetlands and fight water pollution. The challenge to the \"Good Neighbor\" rule was brought by Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia — all targeted by the rule — as well as pipeline operators, U.S. Steel, regional electricity generators and energy trade associations. In their suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, they argued that the EPA violated a federal law aimed at ensuring agency actions are reasonable. The D.C. Circuit refused to block the rule pending its review, prompting the challengers to ask the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to intervene. Opponents have said the rule would impose unreasonable costs and destabilize power grids. The Justice Department, defending the EPA, urged the Supreme Court to consider the serious harms to public health that would result from blocking it. The rule implemented a federal program that applied to 23 states, but separate challenges in lower courts have already paused enforcement in 12 of them, including West Virginia. During arguments in the case on Feb. 21, some of the conservative justices focused on the EPA's lack of explanation for how the plan can work when it now regulates just 11 states instead of 23 as intended. Liberal justices expressed concern about whether the case warranted emergency intervention by the Supreme Court at this time. Some of the industry requests of the Supreme Court were specific. Kinder Morgan asked the justices to block the regulation as it applies to natural gas pipeline engines. U.S. Steel sought to prevent its enforcement against iron and steel mill reheating furnaces and boilers. On Jan. 16, the EPA issued a proposed rule to enforce the \"Good Neighbor\" plan in five more states: Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The Supreme Court is deciding multiple cases during its current term concerning challenges to the authority of various federal agencies. The justices on May 16 upheld the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan industry.",
