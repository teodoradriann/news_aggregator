    "text": "Investing.com -- Plus de 30.000 travailleurs de Boeing (NYSE : BA ) sont prêts à se mettre en grève après que les employés de l'usine de la société dans le nord-ouest du Pacifique américain aient voté pour un arrêt de travail en raison de demandes d'augmentation de salaire, ce qui présente de nouveaux défis pour le géant de l'aérospatiale.\nLes actions de Boeing ont chuté de plus de 3 % lors de la première séance du marché américain vendredi.\nInvestingPro vous aide à faire de meilleurs choix en bourse, quel que soit votre profil ou votre stratégie, que vous souhaitiez obtenir des outils de pointe, une assistance à l'investissement, ou tout simplement suivre des conseils clés en mains. La grève devrait commencer à minuit, heure du Pacifique (0700 GMT), vendredi et constitue la première action syndicale majeure de l'entreprise depuis 2008. Les médias locaux de Washington ont rapporté que 96 % des membres du principal syndicat de Boeing ont voté en faveur de la grève, les membres déclarant que les salaires et les avantages offerts par l'entreprise lors des récentes négociations n'étaient pas suffisants pour vivre.\nBoeing a déclaré que les travailleurs avaient clairement fait savoir que l'accord provisoire conclu au début du mois n'était \"pas acceptable\", ajoutant qu'il était \"prêt à revenir\" à la table des négociations.\nLa grève représente un autre obstacle majeur pour le constructeur d'avions et son nouveau directeur général, Kelly Ortberg. L'entreprise s'efforce de rétablir sa réputation à la suite de nouveaux problèmes de qualité concernant ses avions à réaction. L'attention portée à Boeing a été ravivée cette année après qu'un panneau de porte s'est détaché d'un avion 737 MAX en janvier, tandis qu'une défaillance de son vaisseau spatial Starliner a bloqué deux astronautes à bord de la Station spatiale internationale.\nLa dernière grève de Boeing, en 2008, a coûté à l'entreprise environ 1,3 milliard de dollars en raison de l'échelonnement de la production et de l'augmentation des salaires.\nDans une note adressée à leurs clients, les analystes de Jefferies ont déclaré que la \"question clé maintenant\" est celle de la durée potentielle de la grève, étant donné l'écart entre les augmentations de salaires convenues dans l'accord de principe et les rémunérations plus élevées demandées par les travailleurs.\nIls ont ajouté qu'un arrêt de travail prolongé représentait un \"risque\" pour les niveaux de production du 737 MAX en particulier. La production de l'avion a déjà été limitée à 38 jets par mois par l'Administration fédérale de l'aviation américaine au début de l'année, dans le cadre d'une campagne visant à s'assurer que les processus de sécurité de Boeing étaient adéquats.\nAmbar Warrick a contribué à ce rapport.\nLes ouvriers de Boeing se mettent en grève après le rejet de l’accord par le syndicat",

    "text": "Chief Master Sergeant Edward N. Taylor III, Command Chief Master Sergeant for the 179th Cyberspace Wing, at Mansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base, Mansfield, Ohio, has given 34 years of dedicated service to the American Armed Forces. Taylor’s grandfather on his mother’s side was the first black milkman in town, and his great great great grandfather on his father’s side was one of the first runaway slaves to own property in Mississippi. Being the first runs in Chief Taylor's blood, and now he is making history in real time as the first black Command Chief of the 179th and the first Command Chief of a National Guard Cyberspace Wing.\nAt eight years old Taylor's grandfather, Clavin Gant, told him stories of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first black military aviators. The Tuskegee Airmen, named after their training location at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee, Alabama, formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Force and helped encourage the eventual integration of the U.S. Armed Forces.\nWhile seeing the look in his grandfather’s eyes and the pride in his voice while sharing stories of resilience and shattering glass ceilings, Taylor knew that he would pursue a career in the military.\nJanuary 4th, 1990, Taylor joined The Ohio Army National Guard as an Aircraft Armament Technician on the AH-1S Cobra Attack Helicopter. He later joined the Air National Guard in 1999 as a KC135R crew chief.\nThe morning of basic training graduation, Taylor knew he was about to start his journey that he envisioned at eight years old, upholding the legacy of the black service members that paved the way for his service. That same day, Taylor got to experience his grandfather's pride as he stood in his army dress uniform in front of the man that had shared the stories to shape his career.\n“My grandfather was exceptionally proud. He would be ecstatic to see what I am doing today,\" said Taylor.\nTaylor states that his purpose both in life and as a leader is to help people be better people. Taylor’s office door is always open for any conversation, from mentorship of a newly enlisted Airman, to talking about weekend plans with his fellow 1-7-niners giving him the opportunity to know them on a personal level. In Taylor’s career he has made having hard conversations a priority, with a strong belief that addressing a problem head on is the only way to make room for growth.\n“The key to being successful as a leader is transparency, making sure everybody knows, sees, and feels on the same level,” said Taylor.\nWhile working with other senior leaders Taylor reminds his peers, “We are not turning the wrenches or on the keyboards anymore, we need to get out of that mindset, and focus on removing barriers so those doing the job can be as efficient and effective as possible.”\nTaylor has been a member of the Ohio Memorial Chapter of Tuskegee Airmen Inc. for almost two decades, working to uphold the legacy, history, and values of those who were a part of the original Tuskegee Experience, and Introducing youth across Ohio to the world of aviation and science. Taylor helped plan the first Ohio Tuskegee Airmen Day in 2021, to continue annually on March 29th. Through his membership with The Tuskegee Airmen Ohio Memorial Chapter, Taylor has had the opportunity to meet multiple original Tuskegee Airmen.\n“I had the chance to meet these airmen and hear what they had gone through and hear them say that they would do it all over again, that they loved the service,” said Taylor.\nChief Master Sergeant Edward N. Taylor III, was inspired in his life by many “firsts” and now 34 years into his career he holds two “first” titles of his own. All eyes are on him as he pioneers being the first Command Chief of a National Guard Cyberspace Wing, and the first black Command Chief in our installation’s 75 year history. As time progresses and barriers are removed, society will see less firsts, but we should always recognise those who paved the way.\n“It is exciting to have the first, but the goal is to have a 31st and a 51st in a completely diversified force,” said Taylor.\n|Date Taken:||02.29.2024|\n|Date Posted:||02.29.2024 16:57|\n|Story ID:||465025|\n|Location:||MANSFIELD, OH, US|\n|Web Views:||5|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, Chief Master Sergeant Edward N.

    "title": "Pro-Slavery Forces Burn the Free State Hotel — the Sack of Lawrence",
    "text": "5 hours ago User-posted content In 1856, the Kansas Territory was caught in a violent struggle between anti-slavery Free Staters and pro-slavery Border Ruffians. In May, U.S. Marshal I.B. Donaldson led a small army against the Free State stronghold at Lawrence, Kansas, intending to arrest Free Staters accused of treason. After carrying out the arrests, Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, who was pro-slavery, took command of the army and raided the town, destroying buildings and terrorizing the inhabitants. The “Sack of Lawrence” left the town in shambles and heightened tensions in the war along the Kansas-Missouri border, and led John Brown to seek retribution .\nThe Tragic Prelude by John Steuart Curry depicts John Brown and the violence of the border war. Photo by Wikimedia The Kansas-Nebraska Act In the mid-1850s, Americans living in the territory that included present-day Kansas and Nebraska looked to organize new States to join the Union.\nAt the time, slavery was banned in the region by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Because of this, Slave States opposed the organization of new territories that could potentially become Free States. They were worried the addition of Free States would upset the balance of power in Congress and lead to the abolition of slavery.\nDespite their objections, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 . Two territories were established, west of Missouri, and divided at the 40th parallel:\nNebraska to the north. Kansas to the south. It also stipulated that the section of the Missouri Compromise prohibiting slavery in the Louisiana Purchase north of the southern border of Missouri was “inoperative and void.” It allowed the people living in the new territories to decide for themselves if they would allow slavery — a concept known as “ Popular Sovereignty .”\nIllinois Senator Stephen Douglas submitted the Kansas-Nebraska Act to Congress. Photo by Wikimedia The Eve of the Civil War in the Kansas-Missouri Border Because of its proximity to two Slave States — Missouri and Texas — Abolitionists and Anti-Abolitionists rushed to determine the fate of slavery in Kansas.\nThe Abolitionists were known as “Free Staters” because they wanted Kansas to be a Free State.\nAs settlers moved into the territory, land disputes, personal feuds, politics, and their stance on slavery fueled violence. It also affected the establishment of towns:\nLawrence, Kansas was founded by two groups of New Englanders. The Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society , an Abolitionist organization, sponsored these groups. Leavenworth and Atchison were founded by pro-slavery settlers. Most of these settlers were from Missouri. Militia factions also formed. The pro-slavery militia was referred to as the “ Border Ruffians ,” while the Free Staters were called “ Jayhawkers .”\nTrade sign used at the Boston headquarters of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Photo by Wikimedia The Wakarusa War In November 1855, the Wakarusa War started when the tension between the two factions led to murder. Franklin R. Coleman, a Border Ruffian, killed Charles R. Dow, a Free Stater. Coleman insisted he killed Dow in self-defense, but Free Staters believed it was motivated by Dow’s stance on slavery.\nA mob burned Coleman’s house to the ground, and Sheriff Samuel J. Jones tried to arrest Jacob Branson, a Free Stater, for the crime. A mob of Free Staters gathered and forced Jones to release Branson, who was taken to Lawrence to keep him safe.\nJones followed the Free Staters to Lawrence and sent a message to Governor Wilson Shannon , informing him that a group of armed men had taken his prisoner.\nShannon called up the militia and hundreds of men responded. However, most of them were Border Ruffians, who were eager to attack the Free Staters in Lawrence. Jones and the Border Ruffians gathered on the Wakarusa River, just outside Lawrence, and laid siege to the town.\nFree Staters took measures to defend themselves. They built defensive works in Lawrence and raided the Federal Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, seizing weapons and ammunition.\nOn December 6, Thomas Barber, a Free Stater, was killed after he ventured outside of Lawrence.\nWakarusa War Photo by Legends of America Meanwhile, Governor Shannon intervened and mediated a truce between the Border Ruffians and Free Staters. Although the Border Ruffians disbanded, Governor Shannon and the Free Staters feared they would return. Shannon gave the leaders of the Free Staters — James H. Lane and Charles Robinson — permission to organize their Jayhawkers into a legal militia.\nJohn Brown Arrives in Kansas Toward the end of the Wakarusa War, John Brown arrived in Kansas and was given command of a Jayhawk militia company. Brown was a vocal opponent of the peace treaty that ended the conflict.\nAccording to historian Richard Cordley : “John Brown was one of the unique characters which the Kansas struggle drew out. He was a man by himself. Very few of the free-state men agreed with him in his policy or action. Many of them were in constant fear that he would precipitate a conflict by some rash deed. He came to Kansas because he hated slavery, and his hatred of it was as a fire to his bones.”\nJohn Brown Photo by Library of Congress Growth of Lawrence Despite the Wakarusa War, the town of Lawrence experienced tremendous growth in 1855. While many settlers built shacks and log cabins to live in, some were able to build framed houses and some were built from stone and a new building material called “concrete.”\nThe largest structure in Lawrence, the Free State Hotel , was started by the Emigrant Aid Company and cost $20,000. During the Wakarusa War, Free State leaders used it as a shelter, even though it was still under construction.\nThe threat of violence from the Border Ruffians forced the people of Lawrence to think about defending themselves at all times. A pastor wrote, “All the public buildings are turned into barracks, the preaching hall with the rest, and nothing is thought of but the best means of defense.”\nWhile the Jayhawkers focused on dealing with the Border Ruffians, many new settlers simply wanted to move on with their lives. However, they were all joined together over the common cause of ensuring Kansas would be a Free State.\nLawrence Suffers Through the Harsh Winter of 1855–1856 The winter of 1855-1856 was harsh. It kept Border Ruffians from harassing the Free Staters in and around Lawrence, but the Free Staters also suffered from severe cold. Captain Samuel Walker, a Free Stater, wrote:\n“I failed to complete my log house before the winter of 1855-56 set in…Our cabin had no floor, but we were as well off in this particular as most of our neighbors. Chinks and fissures abounded in roof and gable...Seven of us made up the family, five children mostly small. At times when the winds were bleakest we actually went to bed as the only escape from freezing. More than once we woke in the morning to find six inches of snow in the cabin. To get up and make one’s toilet under such circumstances was not a very comfortable performance….”\nThe Slavery Faction Puts Its Scheme in Motion Meanwhile, the Border Ruffians and pro-slavery leaders were preparing to push the Free Staters out of Kansas. However, they needed to do this without attracting the attention of the Federal Government.\nAt the time, the Kansas government was controlled by the pro-slavery faction. However, Border Ruffians played a part in manipulating the election. The Kansas legislature was called the “ Bogus Legislature ” and the Free Staters responded by forming a government, even though it had no authority.\nThe scheme started in the spring of 1856 when pro-slavery leaders accused the leaders of the Free State government of treason.\nSheriff Jones Returns to Lawrence In April 1856, Sheriff Jones returned to Lawrence, with warrants to arrest the Free-Staters who had taken part in freeing Jacob Branson.\nJones arrived on the 18th but was unsuccessful. The next day, he tried to arrest Samuel F. Tappan. However, Tappan resisted, hit Jones, and escaped.\nGovernor Shannon responded by giving Jones 10 soldiers and an officer for a posse, so he could carry out his duties.\nOn April 23, Jones and his posse returned to Lawrence. Upon arrival, he arrested people whom he accused of refusing to help him on the 18th and 19th.\nJones stayed in Lawrence overnight and was in a tent when someone shot him in the back. At first, rumors flew throughout Kansas that Jones had been “mortally wounded” and “foully murdered.”\nThe Bogus Legislature used this to its advantage. It worked with a pro-slavery judge, Samuel D. Lecompte , to file charges of treason against prominent Free Staters — including James H. Lane and Charles Robinson . A Grand Jury — which met in secret — responded quickly and indicted them on the charges. However, one of the people on the jury warned the Free Staters.\nCharles L. Robinson Photo by Wikimedia The Free State Hotel is Completed By this time, the construction of the Free State Hotel in Lawrence was completed. This was important to the Free Staters because it gave new immigrants arriving in Lawrence a place to stay.\nAccording to historian Richard Cordley, the pro-slavery faction and Border Ruffians believed “To destroy this hotel was to remove a powerful attraction. All these disturbances had largely the same motive. They would keep the country in such a state of confusion and terror that settlers would be kept away.”\nMarshal Donaldson’s Proclamation On May 11, I .B. Donaldson, the U.S. Marshal for the Kansas Territory , issued a proclamation that called on “law abiding citizens” to assemble to help carry out the arrest warrants for Free Staters. According to Cordley, this meant: “The United States court had issued the order, and a United States marshal was to execute it. The people of Lawrence must tamely submit, or resist United States authority.”\nFree Staters quickly assembled and appealed to Governor Shannon for help. However, he denied them, saying he did not have the authority to interfere with the duties of Marshal Donaldson or Sheriff Jones.\nMeanwhile, Border Ruffians responded to Donaldson’s call to help enforce the law. They formed camps near Donaldson’s headquarters, at Lecompton, Kansas. Among the Border Ruffians who joined Donaldson were the Douglas County Militia, the Kickapoo Rangers, and the Missouri Platte County Rifles (see First Sack of Lawrence ).\nLawrence Prepares for the Attack On May 13, the people of Lawrence responded with resolutions that said:” …we are ready to resist, if need be, to the death, the ravages of an invading mob.”\nHowever, leaders disagreed on how to prepare for any attack. Some argued they had not broken any laws and they did not need to defend themselves. Others argued it was during a critical time for planting crops and people could not be asked to leave their farms.\nOn May 14, the town leaders sent a letter to Marshal Donaldson and asked him to clarify the charges against the Free Staters. They insisted they wanted to remain peaceful, but were aware the “...men collected about Lawrence openly declare that their intention is to destroy the town and drive off the citizens.”\nMarshal Donaldson responded that they were in violation of the territorial laws and had tried to assassinate Sheriff Jones. Donaldson questioned why they had armed themselves and said, “...those who seek to resist the laws of the land, and turn traitors to their country, will find me aiding in enforcing the laws, if not as an officer, as a citizen.”\nThe people of Lawrence appealed to Governor Shannon. They wanted him to ask the Federal government to send U.S. Army troops to serve in Donaldson’s army, instead of the Border Ruffians. Once again, Shannon refused to intervene.\nBy this time, violence had already started. The Border Ruffians were patrolling the roads, looking for Free Staters. They killed a man who left the safety of Lawrence and harassed farms in the area.\nThe Sacking of Lawrence On May 21, Marshal Donaldson, Sheriff Jones, and the Border Ruffians arrived outside of Lawrence. They assembled on Mount Oread, overlooking the town, and pointed artillery at the town. The people of Lawrence decided not to resist the authority of the United States Government.\nAround 11:00, the Deputy Marshal rode into town and arrested G.W. Smith, Gains Jenkins, and G.W. Deitzler, all of whom had been indicted on charges of treason.\nThe Free Staters invited Marshal Donaldson and his men to dinner at the Free State Hotel. The invitation was accepted. Afterward, Donaldson returned to his camp. He told Sheriff Jones and the Border Ruffians he was satisfied and dismissed them.\nOutraged, Sheriff Jones asked the Border Ruffians to remain and serve as a posse on his behalf. This effectively transformed the small army from a Federal force to a territorial one, but the people in Lawrence did not know this.\nJones rode into town and demanded the townspeople give up their weapons. He threatened to use the artillery to bombard the town if they refused. The town leaders agreed to his demands.\nAs soon as Jones had everything in his possession, he told the people living in the Free State Hotel to leave, because he intended to destroy it. After he failed to do so with the artillery, he had his men burn it to the ground. As the walls collapsed, Jones said, “This is the happiest moment of my life.”\nFree State Hotel Historical Marker Photo by Historical Marker Database The Border Ruffians continued to terrorize the town. They burned the offices of two Abolitionist newspapers. They vandalized homes, ransacked them, and burned the homes of Free State leaders.\nAt one point, the Border Ruffians raised a flag that said, “Southern Rights” on one side and “South Carolina” on the other.\nAftermath of the Sack of Lawrence The Lawrence Committee of Safety sent an account of the attack to Washington, D.C. The town was devastated by what the Abolitionist press in the North called the “Sack of Lawrence.”\nRumors flew that Free Staters had been killed by the Border Ruffians, which was not true. However, the fact that a U.S. Marshal had organized the small army — and allowed Sheriff Jones to take control of it — significantly heightened the tensions in the Border War.\nFour days later, John Brown had his revenge in one of the most brutal massacres to take place in American history — the Pottawatomie Massacre .\nCorrections If you see a grammatical or factual error in this article let us know in the comments.

    "text": "A reduction in wind helped firefighters keep the Post Fire within its 15,690-acre “footprint” as of Thursday, although hot spots remain in the south, according to Landon Haack, operations section chief for CalFire.\nThe southern portion of the fire, near Pyramid Lake, remains the most active area and where firefighters’ efforts were focused Thursday, Haack said in a video posted on social media. The containment percentage reached 47% as of the morning.\nThe evacuation areas shifted based on the announcements made by the L.A. County Fire Department on social media.\nThe evacuation order for Paradise Ranch in Castaic was lifted, but an order was converted to a warning for areas south of Pyramid Lake, west of Interstate 5, east of the Los Angeles County line, and just north of Templin Highway.\nAn evacuation order remains in place for areas south of Gorman Post Road, west of Interstate 5, east of the Los Angeles County line, and north of Pyramid Lake, according to the county Fire Department.\nThanks to a day of mopping up Wednesday, the situation on the northern perimeter of the fire is “looking really, really good,” Haack said, pointing to the top of a giant map stretched out behind him.\n“There’s a line all the way around the fire up there,” he added, referring to acres of blackened brush that can be seen from the freeway.\n“The crews are continuing to get on our biggest points of concern, which are down here on the southern end and partially into the wilderness area,” Haack said. A small piece of the fire crossed the lake, which was part of the concern on Wednesday.\nSteep terrain continues to present a challenge, Haack said, although Thursday’s incident report indicated there were fewer helicopters in use than the previous day, and the number of personnel remained roughly the same.",

    "text": "Thinking greener and cleaner: Waste management company gives tips on recycling after the holidays GEORGETOWN, Del. – After opening up all those Christmas gifts, it can be hard to distinguish what’s recyclable from what’s not. Environmental Educator at Joan’s Crossroads Landfill, Andi Errico said sorting through your waste is crucial in ensuring it gets dropped off at the right place. “If you think about all your trash and waste, if it went to the landfill, it’ll fill them up a lot faster than if we were to be separated,” Errico said. Cardboard boxes, wrapping paper and even Christmas trees are just a few of the items that the landfill finds good use in after the holidays. Errico said every recyclable item that’s dropped off has a bigger purpose. “When it comes to yard waste, which would include your holiday trees, those are mulched on site, at our landfills,” Errico said. “Then, it’s used to cover the landfill at night, to cap the landfill for the day, to make sure nothing escapes.” The recycling effort shouldn’t stop right after the holidays. Errico said if everyone does their part, Delaware should be able to increase the amount of diverted recyclables in the long run. “I would love, for people in 2024, to increase their recycling,” Errico said. “We have so many people in this world, and we all produce waste.” “The statistic is, every American throws away 4.5 pounds of trash a day, and we have billions of people, and that accumulates pretty fast,” Errico added.",

    "title": "Off-road drivers were swept away by river, says man who tried to save them | News and Star",
    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.

    "title": "Russia military drone 'spotted over German nuclear power plant' sparking WWIII fears",
    "text": "WW3 fears explode as Russian drones spotted over key EU infrastructure Insiders have raised the alarm about a Russian military drone possibly flying over a German nuclear power plant, signaling another act of Kremlin espionage that has caused concern for the west. The incident involved an &quot;enemy object&quot; hovering over the shut-down facility and a natural gas terminal in Brunsbuttel, Schleswig-Holstein, according to Bild. The publication also noted that several other drones were seen nearby recently. An internal police report was quoted by Bild: &quot;The no-fly zone was violated several times by flying over the nuclear power plant. An enemy object, believed to be a military drone, was captured.&quot; Sources suggest the drone likely came from Russia and might have been sent from civilian vessels in the North Sea. The Flensburg public prosecutor&#039;s office is looking into the possibility of a sabotage attempt. There have also been sightings of unidentified drones over German military bases where Ukrainian forces are being trained. Marcus Faber, a member of the German parliament, expressed his concerns to Bild in January, saying, &quot;Drones are regularly spotted over the Klietz military training area, where the Bundeswehr (German military) trains Ukrainians (on Leopard 1 tank).&quot; Mr Faber implied that Russia was responsible for these occurrences and highlighted Germany&#039;s urgent need for better drone technology and modern jamming equipment. German politician, Andreas Schwarz, has voiced his concerns over Russia&#039;s potential spying activities, stating: &quot;We must not allow Russia to spy on military training areas with drones.&quot; By the end of August 2023, Germany had trained at least 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers, with a target of 10,000 by year-end. The training programs have included general combat training and the use of advanced equipment such as Patriot air defence systems and US-supplied Abrams tanks.
