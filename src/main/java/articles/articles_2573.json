Police said they could confirm nine dead and they were waiting for more details.\nThe border region is considered a no-go area for citizens. Police and other law enforcement agencies do not have much control of the area, which a large number of gangs use as a safe haven.

    "text": "20+ Year Business and Marketing Expert Makes Her High-Stakes Reality TV Debut PORTLAND, OR - In the last 20 years, Lindsey Anderson, leading online business consultant, has become one of the most influential voices in the digital marketing space. To date, her work has been showcased in several major media publications such as Fox, NBC, CBS, Huffington Post, ABC, and others.\nA business scaling expert, Lindsey offers multiple programs—including the Content That Converts 90-Day Transformation Program and the 1:1 Mastery Program—that help coaches, consultants and experts generate more high-quality leads and convert them into paying clients. She is also the driving force behind the Build and Monetize (BAM) Agency. Her agency goes beyond conventional advertising services, offering a comprehensive approach to elevate marketing and sales efforts.\nThe BAM Agency doesn't just stop at running paid advertising campaigns; they actively support product launches and put their client’s entire marketing and sales strategy into overdrive. Their expertise extends beyond tactical aspects, encompassing years of business strategy, market positioning, and brain-based learning design.\nAuthor of the best-selling book, The Click Technique , and host of The Millionaire Maker Show podcast, Lindsey has developed several online marketing strategies that have been instrumental in helping entrepreneurs scale their online businesses. Now, she will be putting her business acumen to the test when she appears on Netflix’s highly anticipated reality TV series, The Trust: A Game of Greed .\nThe upcoming show’s premise revolves around a group of 11 strangers who are competing to win the grand prize—a quarter of a million dollars. The catch? The contestants are awardedthe prize money at the beginning of the show in the form of a trust. The money belongs to them, and if they survive the entire season, each contestant will be able to claim an even share.\nUnlike the average game show, the contestants’ fates are entirely dependent on each other, facing the dilemma of sharing the prize equally or strategically voting each other out. With the power to eliminate a contestant with just one vote, Lindsey and her peers grapple with the decision between relationships and money. The Trust is a riveting social experiment filled with drama, featuring betrayal, deception, paranoia, and greed as contestants fight to keep the big prize. The show challenges the conventional timeline of trust development, exploring whether trust can emerge among strangers when money is on the line.\nTo catch the first episode of The Trust: A Game of Greed when it airs on Netflix on January 10, 2024, click here.

A Newcastle man is making travel plans after winning a Lotto 6-49 second prize. Robert Genosko plays the lottery weekly, and won $101,904.60 in the Aug. 28 draw. Genosko uses OLG’s Quick Pick feature to make his selections and always adds Encore to his tickets. “I checked my ticket on the OLG app and was initially confused by what I saw,” Genosko said in a press release. “I checked my ticket on multiple phones to make sure what I was seeing was real. I was shocked and so happy.” Genosko first shared the news with his wife. “At first, she thought I had won $101, but when she looked a little closer, she was pleasantly surprised. Winning is an incredible feeling. It’s both shocking and unbelievable, but it could happen to you.” He plans to help his family and travel. “I plan to enjoy every moment of life with my family,” he concluded. The winning ticket was purchased at [Esso on King Avenue East](https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=00b2415a928ac49a&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA999CA999&output=search&q=Esso+on+King+Avenue+East&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0C5IIOpSDYVh51ut_zQFgH585hUmXBEfiyc3KZbf5BCLrdAeHw6QgI_YgMUsbX0iPItlukb7cOdhfcpIKoAlDR2K-Tpc-QEntO4DRtQHosQ09Im1z6G49EGekMFw3NUymhwKBXk1rDrB5TuPUCJofRVbnLoVWwN-L_Plj7tx1j42BhX8mEFzjPEkYiEhPcYk9nQ7R-xPwY0k648GI19OayHqzlFCQ&entry=mc&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111) in Newcastle Contact us at [thenewsroom@metroland.com](mailto:thenewsroom@metroland.com) To join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.

    "title": "A lei foi feita para o bem do ser humano",
    "text": "A lei foi feita para o bem do ser humano\n9º Domingo do Tempo Comum [02 de junho de 2024]\n[Mc 2,23 – 3,6]\nO relato do evangelho para esse domingo sugere dois pontos de reflexão: o repouso dominical e a transgressão da lei.\nSão João Paulo II escreveu uma cartinha sobre o domingo (Dies Domini). Ali ele tenta mostrar a importância de se recuperar o Domingo como Dia do Senhor, Dia da Criação, Dia do Ser Humano, Dia do Descanso.\nA preocupação do Papa revelava o que estamos vivendo: o domingo perdeu quase por completo seu sentido original que traz no próprio nome: Dominica, Dies Domini: Dia do Senhor. As mudanças nas relações econômicas, culturais, sociais e religiosas pelas quais tem passado o nosso mundo, trazem consigo esse novo modo de viver o Domingo. Isso não somente entre os agnósticos e arreligiosos, mas também entre os próprios cristãos e católicos.\nSe por um lado essa espécie de indiferença diante do domingo e outras celebrações litúrgicas ditas “de preceito” trazem certa dificuldade e tristeza, por outro, ajudam a reconsiderar caminhos feitos e fortalecer aqueles que ainda acreditam na força e importância de celebrar o Domingo como dia do Senhor e do descanso.\nA ordem de Deus a Moisés para que se guardasse o Sábado era um meio de se fazer memória da libertação do Egito operada pelo próprio Senhor. Também traz dentro de si o eterno desejo do Criador: o ser humano não é escravo; precisa viver em liberdade. Quando o texto sagrado diz que “o sétimo dia é sábado para o Senhor teu Deus” (Dt 5,14), quer nos lembrar que o “Sábado” não é mera prescrição ou observância legal, mas uma exigência de liberdade e diálogo entre Deus e seu povo. É um dia de descanso “para o Senhor”. Não é preciso dizer que o Sábado dos judeus se converteu no Domingo para nós cristãos por causa da Ressurreição do Senhor.\nOutra reflexão que fazemos a partir do evangelho de hoje é referente à transgressão das leis e normas. Até que ponto a Lei deve ser cumprida e desde quando deve ser transgredida?\nNos tempos de Jesus a observância do Sábado se transformara num peso insuportável. Em vez de ser dia de repouso, de descanso, tornou-se dia de peso, de cansaço. Uma escravidão. O culto sabático caiu numa ação externa e formal.\nJesus veio dar novo sentido à Lei, ao Sábado. Ele não transgride nem suprime a Lei, mas vem dar-lhe pleno sentido (cf. Mt 5,17). Para isso ele parte de dois princípios: a misericórdia e a consciência. Uma realidade divina e outra humana. Apelo do Alto e resposta humana.\nNo princípio da Misericórdia ele parte da realidade do ser humano e suas necessidades imediatas que precisam estar acima de qualquer lei. Uma legislação ou código de normas que não leva em conta o ser humano como prioridade é vazia de sentido. “O sábado foi feito para o homem e não o homem para o sábado” (Mc 2,27). A misericórdia deve prevalecer sobre as exigências legais. Por isso Jesus cura aquele homem no dia de Sábado. Quem quiser viver o princípio da Misericórdia coloca em risco sua vida à semelhança de Jesus: é uma atitude eucarística.\nUm dado interessante no relato do evangelho de hoje é que, estando dentro da sinagoga, num momento de culto a Deus, enquanto as atenções se voltam para Deus, Jesus volta seu olhar para aquele homem doente. E pede que ele “fique no meio”. Foi, certamente, uma afronta aos dirigentes do culto. Deus não deve ocupar o primeiro e absoluto lugar no culto? Será que Jesus está invertendo o sentido da celebração? O que levou Jesus a colocar o homem doente no centro? – Jesus não inverte o sentido do culto, mas quer ensinar que um culto que não nos compromete com os irmãos é vazio para o Pai. É como se ele dissesse: “O culto que agrada ao Pai é aquele que converte o coração do ser humano e o coloca em empatia, em solidariedade, em atitude de misericórdia para com aqueles que sofrem” (cf. Is 58,6-7). – Convenhamos: há atitudes dentro de nossas celebrações eivadas de egoísmo, vaidade, desprezo, arrogância, indiferença, discriminação... (cf. Tg 2,2-4).\nJesus veio mostrar um novo modo de se relacionar com Deus. O culto que não leva a cuidar do ser humano não chega ao coração do Pai. Podemos afirmar então que a grande contribuição de Jesus em relação às outras religiões é a de revelar um Deus que não existe para si mesmo. Deus criou o ser humano para que participasse de sua vida e glória. Deus é amor que se doa, que sai de si, que se interessa pelo ser humano. E sua glória consiste em buscar o bem de todas as criaturas.\nPortanto, não basta defender a ordem no País, como reza nossa bandeira, se não se busca a defesa e os cuidados dos direitos fundamentais da pessoa humana. O Estado existe para administrar e distribuir equitativamente os bens da Nação. Se, em nome da ordem, o Estado prejudica o ser humano, tal ordem não pode ser cumprida. É um pecado e um crime empenhar-se num progresso que se faz em detrimento da humanidade. O “descartado”, o “inválido”, o “sobrante”, o “invisível” precisa estar “no meio”: para receber visibilidade e cuidado.\nO mesmo pode-se dizer em relação à Igreja. Suas leis devem estar sempre a serviço da humanidade. Não podem constituir-se em uma carga pesada que sufoca e oprime. Não é suficiente defender uma disciplina da Igreja por si mesma. Se tal disciplina não ajuda a comunidade a ser mais generosa, mais tolerante, mais misericordiosa, mais inclusiva precisa ser revista, refeita na medida do Evangelho.\nA primeira missão da Igreja não é impor leis morais, mas ajudar o ser humano a descobrir que Deus o ama. Ajudá-lo a encontrar aquele ponto no qual descobre a bondade e o amor de Deus por ele e pela humanidade toda, manifestado em Jesus de Nazaré. E levá-lo a perceber que ele é chamado por Deus a colaborar na obra da salvação e cuidados da humanidade.\nPe. Aureliano de Moura Lima, SDN",
