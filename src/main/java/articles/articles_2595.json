    "title": "Kamala Harris hints Trump wants Ukraine to surrender and links him to Putin in extraordinary swipe during Zelensky meeting",
    "text": "Kamala Harris insinuated that Donald Trump would support Vladimir Putin in Ukraine when she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House on Thursday.\n“There are those in my country who would force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory. These proposals are the same as Putin’s. And let’s be clear: these are not peace proposals. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,” the Democratic candidate for president said.\nShe did not mention Donald Trump by name, her intention was clear.\nThere were reports that Zelensky wanted to have a conversation with Trump while he was in the United States for the UN General Assembly meeting.\nHis visit came in the shadow of election year politics and many want to spend time with the two contenders vying to become the next occupant of the Oval Office.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Vice President Kamala Harris shake hands during a meeting at the White House\nInstead of a friendly meeting, Zelensky became the target of the former president’s ire.\nTrump called Zelensky “probably the greatest salesman on the planet” during a campaign rally earlier this week in North Carolina.\n“The president of Ukraine is in our country and he is making nasty little insults towards your favorite president, me,” he told his adoring crowd of MAGA supporters.\n“Any deal — the worst deal — would have been better than what we have now,” Trump said, portraying Ukraine as a lost cause.\n“If they had made a bad deal, it would have been much better. They would have given up a little and everyone would still be alive and every building would be built and every tower would age another 2000 years.\n‘What deal can we make? It has been demolished,” he added. ‘The people are dead. The country is in ruins.’\nUkraine has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives to the conflict.\nZelensky is in the United States to convince officials of his “victory plan,” which includes strengthening Western security guarantees for Ukraine, increasing military aid and securing further financial support.\nHe has not released the full details and was not expected to do so during his meetings with President Joe Biden and with Harris.\nHarris has pledged to continue sending military aid to Ukraine if she is elected president. However, Trump is more critical of Zelensky and raises questions about what he will do when he returns to the White House.\nThe vice president, who has met Zelensky seven times, was clear in her support.\n“My support for the Ukrainian people is unwavering. I am proud to stand with Ukraine. “I will continue to support Ukraine and ensure that Ukraine gains the upper hand in this war so that it remains safe and prosperous,” she said.\n“By standing by our friends and defending our ideals against tyranny, America has become the most powerful and prosperous nation in the world. “Putin’s aggression is not only an attack on the Ukrainian people, it is also an attack on fundamental principles such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she added.\nVice President Kamala Harris and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wave from the balcony of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Joe Biden meet in the Oval Office\nZelensky echoed her, saying he was looking forward to the conversation and thanking the US for its support.\n“We believe that this war can be won and that only then can a just peace be achieved,” he said.\nBefore his meeting with Harris, Zelensky met with Biden in the Oval Office.\n“Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail, and we will continue to support you every step of the way,” Biden said, after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan.\nZelensky also visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill – where his government said he also presented his victory plan – and delivered a defiant speech at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.\nThe Ukrainian president’s visit to the United States came as Putin raised the stakes, saying his country should be able to use nuclear weapons if it were attacked by a state backed by a nuclear power.\n“It is proposed to consider aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,” Putin said at a meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday.\nZelensky has pushed for permission to fire more Western weapons into Russia’s heartland. Western leaders fear that Putin will see this as an attack from the West and expand his war.\nHe is also struggling to keep the world’s attention as the war in the Middle East expands. Israel has stepped up its attacks on Lebanon as it targets Hezbollah members.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (center) walks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., left, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nRepublicans were also furious. Zelensky toured a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, calling it an election stunt.\nBut the White House defended the visit and told Republicans to drop the outrage.\n“This came from Ukrainian. Not us,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of the visit.\nZelensky toured the factory with Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top Harris surrogate. Republican Chairman Mike Johnson has called on Zelensky to fire his ambassador to the US for arranging the trip.\n“The Ukrainians have asked to visit the factory where, as you know, American workers are employed to produce crucial supplies that the Ukrainian army uses every day on the front lines of freedom, as it plays a central role in survival of their country,” Jean said. – said Pierre.\nShe pointed out that Zelensky visited Utah in July and Republicans expressed no outrage.\n“President Zelensky traveled to Utah and held an event with the Republican governor, a very similar event, and Republican officials were there at that event in Utah, and there was not a single demand, not one, not a single demand for an investigation.\n“This was the normal course of action for a Ukrainian request in wartime, in wartime. And so I would encourage House Republicans to drop this. They should drop this kind of political stuff,” she noted.\nIn total, the United States has provided approximately $175 billion in both military and economic aid to Ukraine.",

The Golden Knights advanced to the NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed and vaulted into the Frozen Four with a 3-2 victory over No. 5 Minnesota in the quarterfinals. The Golden Knights then fell to the top-seeded and eventual NCAA champion Ohio State Buckeyes, 4-1, in the semifinals.\nClarkson gained first-place in the poll with 113 overall points. Colgate, which finished first in the league in the regular season last year with an 18-4 mark, took second in the poll with 109 points. In a sign of the competition at the top in the league, both Clarkson and Colgate received six votes apiece as the anticipated top team.\nCornell follows closely behind with 103 points and two first-place votes. St. Lawrence is ranked fourth with 92 points and one first-place vote.\nThe remainder of the poll is Quinnipiac (82 points), Yale (69), Princeton (65), Brown (47), Rensselaer (35), Harvard (27), Dartmouth (23) and Union (18).\nECAC Hockey also announced its preseason all-league team and three Clarkson players made the squad with defender and two-time World Championship medalist Haley Winn as the only unanimous selection by the league’s coaches (11 total votes, coaches are not allowed to vote for their team’s players).\nWinn, an All-ECAC second team selection last season, led Clarkson in assists with 29 and tied for the team lead with 39 points with Nicole Gosling.\nGosling, ECAC’s Defender of the Year and a member of the Team Canada gold-medal-winning team at the World Championships this year, also made the ECAC Preseason All-League team at defense.\nClarkson forward Anne Cherkowski rounds out the Golden Knights all-league selections.

    "title": "Alabama to benefit from $20,832,304 grant funding by Biden-Harris Administration to support clean U.S. manufacturing of construction materials | US EPA",
    "text": "July 17, 2024 Contact Information EPA Region 4 Press Office ( ) (404) 562-8400 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (July 17, 2024) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that Alabama will benefit from four grants totaling approximately $20.8M to support efforts to report and reduce climate pollution from the manufacturing of construction materials. EPA estimates that the construction materials used in buildings and other built infrastructure account for more than 15% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions.\nBillions of tons of concrete, asphalt, steel, glass and other construction materials and products are required to build, maintain and operate our country’s buildings and infrastructure. The U.S. leads the world in the production of clean construction materials, and these transformative awards from President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history--will reduce climate pollution by helping businesses measure the carbon emissions associated with extracting, transporting and manufacturing their products.\nThe grants will support the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal Buy Clean Initiative , which leverages the U.S. government’s sway as the largest purchaser on Earth to catalyze demand for clean construction materials used in federal buildings, highways, and infrastructure projects. The grants will be awarded to businesses, universities and nonprofit organizations serving all 50 states and will help disclose the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing concrete, asphalt, glass, steel, wood and other materials.\nKnauf Insulation, Inc. (Knauf) has been selected to receive $3,283,879 for work in Alabama, California, Indiana, Michigan, Texas and West Virginia. Knauf is a building materials company that manufactures fiberglass insulation, delivering thermal and acoustical solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and OEM applications. Knauf’s project will aim to improve the quantity, quality and robustness of data used to develop Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), exemplify best practices as related to data disclosure and verification, and spur market demand for low embodied carbon construction products. Knauf’s goal is to develop EPDs for 100% of Knauf's product portfolio, including new and optimized versions of current EPDs. In addition, Knauf will produce a best practice manual on EPD development for industry-wide stakeholders and provide educational seminars to employees at Knauf manufacturing facilities on greenhouse gas reductions. HOLCIM US, Inc. has been selected to receive $1,371,814 for work in Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. In the U.S., Holcim is the largest cement manufacturer and top five producer in aggregates and ready-mix concrete, with approximately 7,000 employees. Holcim’s EPD Accelerator Project will increase the transparency of data on environmental emissions associated with the production of construction materials, generate robust EPDs with a diversity of manufacturers from across the U.S., and drive market demand for lower carbon construction materials. Hemp Building Institute (HBI) has been selected to receive $6,186,200 for work in Alabama, California, Maryland and Tennessee. HBI is nonprofit organization that provides support for entities that manufacture, remanufacture and refurbish construction materials and products. Biogenic materials from agricultural crops such as hemp, soy, and straw bale provide a unique opportunity to directly address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment. The Biogenic Building Materials project will focus on developing EPDs and life cycle assessments for biogenic materials. This project will create a standardized cradle-to-gate product category rules (PCRs) for agricultural crop components that will be combined with gate-to-grave, industry-determined PCRs to create a practical EPD generator tool for biogenic building materials. The overall goal of the project is to assemble the assessments, protocols, tools and training in an ecosystem designed to increase adoption of biogenic building materials from agricultural crops. Oklahoma State University has been selected to receive $9,990,311 for work in Alabama, Guam, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico and Washington. Oklahoma State University is leading the creation of the National Center for Sustainable Construction Materials to promote low carbon construction materials (LCCMs) and generate robust EPDs for materials such as asphalt, concrete, steel and their additives. In collaboration with 11 universities across the United States, including the University of Illinois and University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the project will provide extensive training, create educational programs, and design tools and incentives for adopting LCCMs.\n“As America continues to build more and upgrade our nation’s infrastructure under President Biden’s leadership, cleaner construction materials like concrete and steel are increasingly essential for the nation’s prosperity,” said EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe. “These historic investments will expand market access for a new generation of more climate-friendly construction materials, and further grow American jobs that are paving the way to the clean energy economy.”\nThe grants will help businesses develop robust, high-quality EPDs, which show environmental impacts across the life of a product and can catalyze more sustainable purchasing decisions by allowing buyers to compare. Investments in data and tools will make high-quality EPDs available for 14 material categories, which include both new and salvaged or reused materials. These efforts will help standardize and expand the market for construction products with lower greenhouse gas emissions. They will make it easier for federal, state and local governments and other institutional buyers to ensure the construction projects they fund use more climate-friendly products and materials.\nEPA is also announcing expanded technical assistance opportunities to businesses, the federal government and other organizations across America. EPA will initially offer EPD development support and direct businesses to resources to help them measure and reduce the embodied carbon associated with their materials, such as those provided by the ENERGY STAR Industrial program. Federal agencies and their suppliers will be able to compare the climate impact of various materials to drive near-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Robust EPD data will be further strengthened by a new label program under development that will identify low carbon construction materials for the growing Buy Clean marketplace.\nTogether, the grants and technical assistance programs will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support American jobs. These programs are made possible by the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which creates significant investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction, transport and manufacturing of construction materials and products. The Inflation Reduction Act also provides more than $2 billion to the General Services Administration to use low embodied carbon materials in the construction and renovation of federal buildings and $2 billion to the Federal Highway Administration to incentivize or reimburse the use of low embodied carbon construction materials in certain transportation projects.\nSelections are contingent upon completion of legal and administrative requirements and grantees are tentatively expected to receive their funding in late summer.\nLearn more about EPA’s Grant Program for Reducing Embodied Greenhouse Gases in Construction Materials and Products.\n###",

    "text": "The tight end was a sore spot for the Sooners in 2023. Production never met expectations, and the Sooners offense received nothing from the room this past season.\nTight ends coach Joe Jon Finley was elevated to co-offensive coordinator. Because of that, the expectations of him as a recruiter have also elevated.\nHe has a much better assortment of talent to work with in 2024. Four-star tight end Davon Mitchell will be a big boost to the room, but the Sooners have their work cut out to rebuild the position to the caliber of OU standards from the past.\nOne attempt to do that has the Sooners offering one of North Carolina’s best players, if not the best player in the state. Kendre Harrison is a five-star athlete who projects as a tight end for the Sooners. He’s equally capable of playing defensive end at the Power Five level, but most teams see him as a tight end. He’s the number one prospect in North Carolina for the class of 2026, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in NC who doesn’t think he’s simply the best player in the state, regardless of class.\nHarrison’s physicality oozes on film. Though he’s not necessarily a fluid route runner, he showcases the ability to be molded into a more refined product.\nEvery major school in the country has offered or shown interest in Harrison, and some have offered him as a basketball player. He could very well be a five-star basketball player when his high school career is over.\nKendre Harrison’s Recruiting Profile Film HUDL\nRatings\nStars Overall Position State ESPN N/A N/A N/A N/A Rivals 4 17 N/A N/A 247Sports 4 4 1 1 247 Composite 5 7 1 1 On3 Recruiting 4 N/A N/A N/A On3 Industry 4 8 1 1\nVitals Hometown Reidsville, North Carolina Projected Position Tight End Height 6-6 Weight 240 lbs\nRecruitment Recruitment Offered on January 23rd, 2024 No visit has been scheduled yet Notable Offers Per 247Sports\nOklahoma Alabama Georgia UNC Penn State NC State Arkansas Colorado Michigan Ohio State Twitter Blessed to receive an offer from the University of Oklahoma #AGTG #BoomerSooner @RivalsFriedman pic.twitter.com/Lg5Pkv6ObL\n— k̷e̷n̷d̷r̷e̷’̷ ̷h̷a̷r̷r̷i̷s̷o̷n̷ (@SupremeDre8) January 23, 2024",

Una vez a temperatura ambiente se cortan los tentáculos en trozos del tamaño de un bocado, se salpimientan y se saltean en dos cucharadas de aceite de oliva en una sartén grande , se le agrega el vino blanco y la guindilla y en cuanto rompe el hervor, se retira del fuego y se reserva la preparación.\nLa albahaca, el perejil y el cebollino deben lavarse con abundante agua y cortarlos en juliana menuda. Mientras tanto se hierven los tallarines siguiendo las instrucciones del paquete. Cuando estén ‘al dente’, se cuelan y se incorporan a la sartén del preparado del pulpo . Agregar media taza del agua de la cocción de los tallarines y se dejan a fuego fuerte durante tres minutos, removiendo bien para que se mezclen los sabores.\nRetirar del fuego y dejar reposar unos minutos. Una vez servida en el plato se echa un chorrito de aceite de oliva sobre cada porción y se espolvorean las verduras cortadas. Se sugiere agregar queso rallado del tipo grana padano, parmesano reggiano u otro similar.\nEsta receta ecológica típicamente mediterránea y con innegables raíces italianas, es ideal para servir a toda la familia, ya que, además de resultar exquisita, aporta muchos nutrientes , por lo que es sanísima y un regalo para el paladar.",

    "title": "Google offers to level playing field for RMG apps; CCI seeks stakeholder feedback",
    "text": "In a move aimed at resolving an antitrust dispute with Indian gaming platform WinZO, Google has proposed significant changes to its policies for the Play Store and advertising in India. The company's new framework would allow a wider range of real-money gaming apps on its platforms, a departure from its previous pilot program that only included daily fantasy sports and rummy.\nIndia's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has invited public feedback on Google's \"commitment proposal.\" The tech giant has offered to allow all real-money games to be distributed on the Play Store, provided that developers can furnish proof from a \"third-party authoritative body\" that the app is a \"game of skill,\" not gambling. This commitment application was filed under Section 48B of the Competition Act, 2002, following an earlier prima facie order under Section 26(1) in response to a complaint by WinZO in 2022.\nThe Commission identified three key concerns: the alleged exclusion of certain real-money gaming (RMG) apps from Google Play, a competitive disadvantage arising from the selective onboarding of DFS and Rummy apps, and the prolonged duration of the pilot program that allegedly perpetuated these disadvantages.\nThe proposal comes after a complaint from WinZO, which argued that Google's 2022 pilot program was discriminatory because it excluded other types of real-money games. The CCI subsequently launched a formal investigation into Google's policies.\nIn response, Google submitted a \"Play Commitment Proposal\" which will eliminate the pilot program and allow all RMGs self-declared by developers as legally permissible under Indian laws to be distributed on the Play Store. Developers must obtain a third-party certification from a \"Recognised Third Party\" — industry associations like the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF), E-Gaming Federation (EGF), or Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS) — that verifies the app is a game of skill. These third parties are required to meet objective criteria, and certification must be demonstrably credible.\nRMG developers will also need to comply with Google's broader platform rules, including the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) and Developer Program Policies (DPP), which Google will update to reflect these new inclusions. Google has stated that it would also finalize an \"appropriate business model\" for these developers. These changes will be implemented within 120 days of the Commission’s approval.\nUnder the new proposal, developers would self-declare their apps as permissible real-money games. To be listed on the Play Store and to be eligible for advertising, they would need to provide third-party certification. Recognized industry associations like the All India Gaming Federation, E-Gaming Federation, or the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports could serve as these certifying bodies.\nGoogle also submitted an \"Ads Commitment Proposal\" to address concerns about discriminatory advertising policies. Under this plan, all permissible RMGs—not just DFS and Rummy—will be eligible to advertise on Google platforms, provided they receive certification from a Recognised Third Party and comply with Google Ads policies. These ad-related changes will take effect within 150 days of the CCI’s approval.\nA Google spokesperson expressed optimism about the proposal, stating, “We’re pleased the CCI is market testing our proposed framework for real-money games (RMGs) in India. This development reflects our constructive discussions with the CCI and the Indian developer community along with our commitment to building a more open and safe ecosystem for RMG apps across Google Play and Google Ads.”\nIn its official summary, Google also clarified that the payment warnings users see during Google Pay transactions are not targeted at RMG apps outside the pilot program. These warnings are uniformly applied based on risk parameters defined by regulatory guidance from the RBI and NPCI and are not discriminatory.\nThis policy shift, if approved, would offer significant benefits to Google, allowing it to earn revenue from a broader segment of the booming Indian real-money gaming market. According to a recent report by WinZO and the Interactive Entertainment and Innovation Council (IEIC), real-money gaming accounts for nearly 86% of the country's online gaming revenue, which was estimated to be around $3 billion in 2024.\nThe proposal could also be a boon for developers who are currently distributing their apps outside the Play Store, often through APK files on their own websites. However, the CCI's broader investigation into whether Google engaged in discriminatory practices is still ongoing.\nAs part of the public consultation process, the CCI has invited stakeholders to send in their comments, objections, or suggestions on the commitment proposal by August 20, 2025. Submissions can be made via email to secy@cci.gov.in or by post to the Commission’s office in New Delhi.\nThis antitrust probe is one of several challenges Google is facing in India. The company has already been fined for allegedly abusing its market dominance through Android and the Play Store and has appealed one of these rulings to the Supreme Court.\nGoogle's spokesperson concluded, “We look forward to continuing to work with the CCI and the wider RMG ecosystem, and are confident our proposed framework will empower Indian developers, grow the digital economy, and prioritize user safety.”\nRead More: Creativeland Asia takes WinZO to court, cries foul over misuse of creative idea",
