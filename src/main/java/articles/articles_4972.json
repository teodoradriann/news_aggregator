    "text": "Stakeholders have advocated for a safe and inclusive digital ecosystem for everyone, especially vulnerable persons. This was the crux of the conversation at the 2024 online safety forum organised by Techsocietal, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The theme of the forum, which took place in Lagos, was ‘Connected and protected: Ensuring safe digital access for all’. NGOs championing digital space safety, representatives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Meta attended the event. Advertisement Speaking during the panel session on online access and safety, Emmanuel Edet, the acting director of regulations and compliance at NITDA, said the government is worried about what people do with digital access. Edet said the government always seeks to provide safety in the digital space for internet users. He added that NITDA has been providing public enlightenment concerning digital space safety. Advertisement “I will start by saying that digital access is not a problem in Nigeria. The problem is meaningful digital access,” Edet said. “What is the quality of access? Beyond that access, what do people do with the kind of access that they have? “The access actually provides the kind of safety that people require. “We need to have a better conversation with the tech community. Let’s understand what our position in terms of online safety is. It is not an imported position but our local position.” Advertisement Also speaking, Juliet Ohahuru-Obiora, the programme director at the Action Against Child Sexual Abuse Initiative (ACSAI), said the internet exposes young people to many dangers. Ohahuru-Obiora noted that there is a need to put safety measures in place to protect the young population. On his part, Adeboye Adegoke, a senior programme manager at Paradigm Initiative, said there must be a clamour for digital literacy campaigns, in addition to creating access. Adegoke said some people believe and accept every piece of information they see on social media without any form of verification, adding that digital literacy is very important. Advertisement “It is not two competing issues to argue that we should protect rights while addressing safety issues online. It is not a conflict,” he said. “Let’s stop presenting the argument that once we protect rights, people are going to be unsafe, or when we want to keep people safe, we have to deprive people of their rights. We can ensure rights while also ensuring safety.” Advertisement Sylvia Musalagani, head of safety policy, Africa, Middle East, and Turkey at Meta, who joined the event virtually, said the organisation is committed to building products that consider the safety of users. Musalagani said Meta has been working with their local partners to enable the tech company to understand the “contexts of content that play out” on their platforms for safer engagement. Advertisement On her part, Chioma Agwuegbo, executive director of TechHer, said big tech companies have a duty of care to users, especially vulnerable people, as it relates to safety. Agwuegbo said big tech companies must welcome criticism from stakeholders on the safety of their products, adding that “true partnership is accountability and co-creation”. Advertisement Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Temitope Ogundipe, executive director of Techsocietal, said there is a need for strong partnerships among stakeholders to achieve safe access to the digital space for everyone. Ogundipe urged parents to actively monitor the mobile devices of their children. Add a comment",

    "title": "AI the Latest Instance of our Capacity for Innovation Outstripping our Capacity for Ethics",
    "text": "AI the Latest Instance of our Capacity for Innovation Outstripping our Capacity for Ethics\nThe eagerness with which movie and television studios have proposed to use artificial intelligence to write content collides with the concern of Writers Guild members for their employment security and pay in the latest episode of technological innovation running ahead of ethical deliberation.\nRegarding modern technology, the psychologist Steven Pinker and the economist/environmentalist E. F. Schumacher have expressed opposite opinions. In his Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress (2018), the former is full of optimism--e.g.,“technology is our best hope of cheating death”--but many decades earlier Schumacher stated that it was “the greatest destructive force in modern society.” And he warned, “Whatever becomes technologically possible . . . must be done. Society must adapt itself to it. The question whether or not it does any good is ruled out.”\nNow, in 2023, looking over all the technological developments of the last century, I think Schumacher’s assessment was more accurate. I base this judgment on recent developments in spyware and Artificial Intelligence (AI). They have joined the ranks of nuclear weapons, our continuing climate crisis, and social media in inclining me to doubt humans’ ability to control the Frankensteinian monsters they have created. The remainder of this essay will indicate why I have made this judgment.\nBefore taking up the specific modern technological developments mentioned above, our main failing can be stated: The structures that we have developed to manage technology are woefully inadequate. We have possessed neither the values nor wisdom necessary to do so. Several quotes reinforce this point.\nOne is General Omar Bradley’s: \"Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.\"\nMore recently, psychologist and futurist Tom Lombardo has observed that “the overriding goal” of technology has often been “to make money . . . without much consideration given to other possible values or consequences.”\nFinally, the following words of Schumacher are still relevant:\n“The exclusion of wisdom from economics, science, and technology was something which we could perhaps get away with for a little while, as long as we were relatively unsuccessful; but now that we have become very successful, the problem of spiritual and moral truth moves into the central position. . . . Ever-bigger machines, entailing ever-bigger concentrations of economic power and exerting ever-greater violence against the environment, do not represent progress: they are a denial of wisdom. Wisdom demands a new orientation of science and technology towards the organic, the gentle, the nonviolent, the elegant and beautiful.”\n“Woefully inadequate” structures to oversee technological developments. How so? Some 200 governments are responsible for overseeing such changes in their countries. In capitalist countries, technological advances often come from individuals or corporations interested in earning profits--or sometimes from governments sponsoring research for military reasons. In countries where some form of capitalism is not dominant, what determines technological advancements? Military needs? The whims of authoritarian rulers or elites? Show me a significant country where the advancement of the common good is seriously considered when contemplating new technology.\nTwo main failings leap out at us. The first, Schumacher observed a half century ago--capitalism’s emphasis on profits rather than wisdom. Secondly--and it’s connected with a lack of wisdom--too many “bad guys,” leaders like Hitler, Stalin, Putin, and Trump, have had tremendous power yet poor values.\nNow, however, on to the five specific technological developments mentioned above. First, nuclear weapons. From the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 until the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, concerns about the unleashing of a nuclear holocaust topped our list of possible technological catastrophes. In 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists established its Doomsday Clock, “a design that warns the public about how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making.” The scientists set the clock at seven minutes to midnight. “Since then the Bulletin has reset the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock 25 times,” most recently in January of this year when it was moved to 90 seconds to midnight--“the closest to global catastrophe it has ever been.” Why the move forward? “Largely (though not exclusively) because of the mounting dangers of the war in Ukraine.”\nSecond, our continuing climate crisis. It has been ongoing now for at least four decades. The first edition (1983) of The Twentieth Century: A Brief Global History noted that “the increased burning of fossil fuels might cause an increase in global temperatures, thereby possibly melting the polar ice caps, and flooding low-lying parts of the world.” The third edition (1990) expanded the treatment by mentioning that by 1988 scientists “concluded that the problem was much worse than they had earlier thought. . . . They claimed that the increased burning of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum was likely to cause an increase in global temperatures, possibly melting the polar ice caps, changing crop yields, and flooding low-lying parts of the world.” Since then the situation has only grown worse.\nThird, the effects of social media. Four years ago I quoted historian Jill Lepore’s highly-praised These Truths: A History of the United States (2018): “Hiroshima marked the beginning of a new and differently unstable political era, in which technological change wildly outpaced the human capacity for moral reckoning.” By the 1990s, she observed that “targeted political messaging through emerging technologies” was contributing to “a more atomized and enraged electorate.” In addition, social media, expanded by smartphones, “provided a breeding ground for fanaticism, authoritarianism, and nihilism.”\nMoreover, the Internet was “easily manipulated, not least by foreign agents. . . . Its unintended economic and political consequences were often dire.” The Internet also contributed to widening economic inequalities and a more “disconnected and distraught” world. Internet information was “uneven, unreliable,” and often unrestrained by any type of editing and fact-checking. The Internet left news-seekers “brutally constrained,” and “blogging, posting, and tweeting, artifacts of a new culture of narcissism,” became commonplace. So, too did Internet-related companies that feed people only what they wanted to see and hear. Further, social media “exacerbated the political isolation of ordinary Americans while strengthening polarization on both the left and the right. . . . The ties to timeless truths that held the nation together, faded to ethereal invisibility.”\nSimilar comments came from the brilliant and humane neurologist Oliver Sacks, who shortly before his death in 2015 https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/the-machine-stops that people were developing “no immunity to the seductions of digital life” and that “what we are seeing—and bringing on ourselves—resembles a neurological catastrophe on a gigantic scale.”\nFourth, spyware. Fortunately, in the USA and many other countries independent media still exists. Various types of such media are not faultless, but they are invaluable in bringing us truths that would otherwise be concealed. PBS is one such example.\nTwo of the programs it produces, the PBS Newshour and Frontline have helped expose how insidious spyware has become. In different countries, its targets have included journalists, activists, and dissidents. According to an expert on The Newshour,\n“The use of spyware has really exploded over the last decade. One minute, you have the most up-to-date iPhone, it's clean, sitting on your bedside table, and then, the next minute, it's vacuuming up information and sending it over to some security agency on the other side of the planet.”\nThe Israeli company NSO Group has produced one lucrative type of spyware called Pegasus. According to Frontline, it “was designed to infect phones like iPhones or Androids. And once in the phone, it can extract and access everything from the device: the phone books, geolocation, the messages, the photos, even the encrypted messages sent by Signal or WhatsApp. It can even access the microphone or the camera of your phone remotely.” Frontline quotes one journalist, Dana Priest of The Washington Post, as stating, “This technology, it's so far ahead of government regulation and even of public understanding of what's happening out there.”\nThe fifth and final technological development to consider is Artificial Intelligence (AI). During the past year, media has been agog with articles on it. Several months ago on this website I expressed doubts that any forces will be able to limit the development and sale of a product that makes money, even if it ultimately harms the common good.\nMore recently (this month) the PBS Newshour again provided a public service when it conducted two interviews on AI. The first was with “Geoffrey Hinton, one of the leading voices in the field of AI,” who “announced he was quitting Google over his worries about what AI could eventually lead to if unchecked.”\nHinton told the interviewer (Geoff Bennett) that “we're entering a time of great uncertainty, where we're dealing with kinds of things we have never dealt with before.” He recognized various risks posed by AI such as misinformation, fraud, and discrimination, but there was one that he especially wanted to highlight: “the risk of super intelligent AI taking over control from people.” It was “advancing far more quickly than governments and societies can keep pace with.” While AI was leaping “forward every few months,” needed restraining legislation and international treaties could take years.\nHe also stated that because AI is “much smarter than us, and because it's trained from everything people ever do . . . it knows a lot about how to manipulate people, and “it might start manipulating us into giving it more power, and we might not have a clue what's going on.” In addition, “many of the organizations developing this technology are defense departments.” And such departments “don't necessarily want to build in, be nice to people, as the first rule. Some defense departments would like to build in, kill people of a particular kind.”\nYet, despite his fears, Hinton thinks it would be a “big mistake to stop developing” AI. For “it's going to be tremendously useful in medicine. . . . You can make better nanotechnology for solar panels. You can predict floods. You can predict earthquakes. You can do tremendous good with this.”\nWhat he would like to see is equal resources put into both developing AI and “figuring out how to keep it under control and how to minimize bad side effects of it.” He thinks “it's an area in which we can actually have international collaboration, because the machines taking over is a threat for everybody.”\nThe second PBS May interview on AI was with Gary Marcus, another leading voice in the field. He also perceived many possible dangers ahead and advocated international controls.\nSuch efforts are admirable, but are the hopes for controls realistic? Looking back over the past century, I am more inclined to agree with General Omar Bradley--we have developed “our technology without wisdom or prudence,” and we are “ethical infants.”\nIn the USA, we are troubled by divisive political polarization; neither of the leading candidates for president in 2024 has majority support in the polls; and Congress and the Supreme Court are disdained by most people. Our educational systems are little concerned with stimulating thinking about wisdom or values. If not from the USA, from where else might global leadership come? From Russia? From China? From India? From Europe? From the UN? The past century offers little hope that it would spring from any of these sources.\nBut both Hinton and Marcus were hopeful in their PBS interviews, and just because past efforts to control technology for human betterment were generally unsuccessful does not mean we should give up. Great leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela did not despair even in their nations’ darkest hours. Like them, we too must hope for--and more importantly work toward--a better future.",

    "text": "Melanie Griffith flaunted a youthful glow in Beverly Hills on Thursday. The Working Girl actress, 66, was leaving a hair appointment with celebrity hair stylist Christopher McMillan, whom Jennifer Aniston has used for years; he created The Rachel haircut. Melanie was maintaining her sassy longer bob cut which she has called 'sassy.' For this outing, Melanie wore her usual black in a knee-length classic coat over a dress of the same length. To keep her legs warm, the Lolita actress wore opaque black tights. She accessorized with a maroon and grey scarf and smart-looking cat-eye black glasses. The veteran actress wore comfortable and casual black sneakers on her feet. Melanie Griffith took a walk through Beverly Hills after her hair appointment. The Working Girl actress, 66, regularly goes to celebrity hair stylist Christopher McMillan to get her color done and maintain her sassy longer bob cut At her last hair appointment in November, the Milk Money star went in for a bit of a change. She shared before and after photos of her hair to Instagram, revealing in the after that she had McMillan lob off a few inches. Melanie eschewed her usual shoulder length, layered hair for a chin-length bob. 'Changing it up! My extraordinary friend and hair magician @mrchrismcmillan gave me a new do! I adore him and thank him,' she captioned the post. And she was thrilled with the outcome, adding: 'I feel refreshed and very sassy at 66!' Griffith is the mom of three adult children. She shares her eldest daughter, Dakota Johnson , 34, with her first husband Don Johnson , to whom she was married for several months in 1976, and again from 1989 until 1996. The Path actress was later married to Steven Bauer from 1981 until 1989, and their son Alexander, 38, was born in 1985. She went on to marry Antonio Banderas in 1996, and they welcomed their daughter Stella, 27, that same year.

Chris often works with Jennifer Aniston as well The Something Wild actress received a tattoo as a tribute to the Desperado star in the 1990s, although the two went on to divorce in 2015. After undergoing the long and arduous process of removing her Banderas-inspired tattoo, Melanie replaced it. She debuted the new ink this summer. Now, instead of the heart shaped tattoo which was once etched onto her skin, she now has the names of her children Alexander, Stella, Dakota, and Jesse jotted onto her arm. Jesse Johnson is her step-son through her second marriage to Don Johnson.",

    "title": "Why Scholar Rock Holding (SRRK) Surged Ahead: A Breakthrough in Muscle Preservation?",
    "text": "Why Scholar Rock Holding (SRRK) Surged Ahead: A Breakthrough in Muscle Preservation?\nOn April 24, 2025, [scholar rock holding] (NASDAQ: SRRK) surged over 25% in a single trading session, outperforming the broader market. The catalyst? A perfect storm of clinical, regulatory, and strategic momentum around its lead drug candidate, apitegromab, which is designed to address muscle-wasting conditions. Let’s unpack why investors are betting big on this biotech’s transformative potential.\nThe EMBRAZE Trial: A Catalyst for Growth\nAt the heart of the rally is anticipation for data from the Phase 2 EMBRAZE trial, which evaluates apitegromab’s ability to counteract muscle loss in patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists—popular obesity drugs like tirzepatide. These therapies often lead to unintended lean muscle loss, a critical issue for long-term health. If apitegromab can mitigate this side effect, it could carve out a $13 billion market opportunity by 2034 in obesity treatments.\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush have already emphasized this dual potential: apitegromab’s primary indication for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and its secondary role in obesity. The trial’s top-line data, expected in Q2 2025, could validate this narrative.\nRegulatory Momentum and Commercial Readiness\nScholar Rock’s path to approval is accelerating. In January 2025, the company submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for SMA treatment, with a six-month fast-track review. A European submission followed in March, setting the stage for potential approvals by late 2025.\nMeanwhile, the company is preparing for a Q4 2025 launch, scaling its salesforce to 50 representatives and securing payer coverage through its “Life Takes Muscle” campaign. This aggressive commercial strategy reduces execution risk—a key concern for investors in biotech.\nAnalyst Optimism and Valuation Upside\nThe stock’s surge also reflects Wall Street’s bullish reevaluation. HC Wainwright raised its price target to $47, citing apitegromab’s “transformative” SMA data and its broader applications. Piper Sandler highlighted the drug’s potential to address unmet needs in both rare diseases and mainstream obesity markets.\nThese upgrades come after apitegromab’s Phase 3 SAPPHIRE trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in motor function for SMA patients—a result that already drove a 440% stock surge in late 2024.\nFinancial Strength and Mitigated Risks\nWith $190.5 million in cash (Q2 2024) and a $275 million public offering in late 2024, Scholar Rock is financially equipped to navigate regulatory hurdles and scale commercial operations. While risks like competition in obesity therapies or regulatory delays exist, the market’s focus on near-term catalysts (EMBRAZE data, FDA approval) has overshadowed these concerns.\nConclusion: A Stock Riding Dual Catalysts\nScholar Rock’s April 24 surge underscores investor confidence in two key pillars:\n1. Clinical Validation: The EMBRAZE trial’s potential to expand apitegromab’s addressable market from SMA (a $2 billion niche) to obesity treatments.\n2. Execution Certainty: Regulatory progress, robust cash reserves, and a well-planned commercial launch.\nWith a 335% year-to-date gain in 2024 and analyst price targets averaging $42 (versus a recent price of ~$25), the stock appears poised for further gains if data and approvals materialize. However, investors must monitor EMBRAZE results closely—positive outcomes could push SRRK toward $50, while a miss might trigger a sharp correction. For now, the momentum is undeniable: Scholar Rock is a biotech to watch in the muscle-preservation and obesity space.",

    "title": "AI Predictions: Meta’s Llama Says These Will Be the 3 Best-Performing Stocks in 2024",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for many industries, sparking public imagination about the capabilities it may one day attain. However, we must temper expectations when it comes to AI predictions for the stock market. While AI tools undoubtedly crunch vast amounts of data at speeds no human could match, even the most advanced models lack contextual understanding and reasoning ability. Nonetheless, experimenting with AI for stock analysis can still prove educational. In that spirit, I decided to test drive Meta’s (NASDAQ: [META](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/meta-stock-quote/)) new natural language model Llama, prompting it to name the top three stocks it expects to outperform in 2024. As with any stock recommendation, skepticism and independent verification is key. Thus, I will be providing my own opinion on these picks below. I expect you to do the same before you choose to invest. Let’s start! Enphase Energy (ENPH) I previously recommended Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: [ENPH](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/enph-stock-quote/)) near when the stock plunged to $75, punished too harshly amidst broad market turmoil. My thesis — Enphase would recover once conditions improved for the renewable energy industry — has partially played out, with shares bouncing back to the $130s. However, I believe there remains meaningful upside still to capture. Revenue is projected to [slip 16.6%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENPH/earnings/estimates) next year as near-term headwinds linger. Still, margins should sustain, thanks to Enphase’s technological edge in microinverters. More exciting is the growth trajectory further out. By 2025, analysts forecast a sharp 38% revenue rebound. Enphase is one of few hardware makers simultaneously levered to surging electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the wider clean energy transition. Consider the total addressable market for EV charging infrastructure. With EVs still comprising just 1% of vehicles on roads globally, we’ve only scratched the surface of potential demand. That creates a massive runway for Enphase to supply integrated solar and battery storage systems powering next-gen charging stations. Additionally, while geopolitical instability has sidelined solar projects since 2022, renewable energy remains a long-term priority for policymakers, given climate goals. In the U.S., the recent Inflation Reduction Act extends solar tax credits through 2032. All things considered, I agree with Llama that ENPH can outperform next year. Medtronic (MDT) Medtronic (NYSE: [MDT](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mdt-stock-quote/)) likewise endured a steep 38% stock selloff from post-pandemic highs, which I view as overdone, given fundamentals. Shares have recovered just about 16% thus far. The company faces pressure. Revenue has [stagnated near $30 billion](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/MDT/summary) since 2019 as hospitals delayed elective surgeries during COVID waves. Bottom-line growth also slowed. Yet analysts [expect](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDT/earnings/estimates) Medtronic’s top line to improve starting next year, averaging 4% annual gains through 2029. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share should bounce back more sharply. Consensus calls for around 10% annual EPS expansion moving forward. So, while headwinds linger, Medtronic’s stock correction overshot rational limits. The quality franchise trades at just 17 times forward earnings. Thus, an earnings-fueled rebound seems likely over the next 12 to 18 months as growth stabilizes. However, tagging Medtronic as a top performer feels like a stretch, given peers with stronger momentum. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: [GOOG](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/), NASDAQ: [GOOGL](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/)) has been a laggard versus big tech peers and has been unable to impress Wall Street. Shares still sit 6% off highs. However, I’m warming back up to the stock at current levels. No doubt, Alphabet faces pressures — advertising demand fluctuates with budgets while rising costs eroded margins last quarter. Zooming out, revenue and earnings should deliver double-digit growth for years to come. Consensus [sees](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates) annual top-line and EPS gains both exceeding 10% through 2028, arguing for a higher valuation than the undemanding 24x forward multiple shares currently fetch. Two exciting potential catalysts make me particularly constructive on Alphabet in the long. The first is traction in AI, as Google aims to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT conversational tool using its [new Gemini model.](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/) The second and nearer-term is ad revenue upside from YouTube’s anti-adblocking efforts. As the globe’s #2 most visited site, YouTube monetizes minimally, given the rampant usage of ad blockers. By restricting extensions that bypass ads, Alphabet could lift sales by making people opt for paid memberships. So, I agree it makes sense to go on your buy list, just not necessarily at the top regarding potential gains.
