    "text": "Perhaps the biggest upset in the election was the defeat of former PM (and brother-in-law of Thaksin Shinawatra) Somchai Wongsawat, whom pundits had predicted would be the next Senate speaker. He lost in the final round of voting.No matter how imperfect or mind-bogglingly complex the process was, the Senate election highlighted a new, unusual dynamic in Thailand's political landscape. The public saw individuals from all walks of life -- ordinary workers, artists, activists, even former PMs -- competing for seats in the Upper House, which for decades had been reserved for the political elites or a select few appointed by the coup-makers of the day.Before this year, the idea that anyone could be a senator was unthinkable. For most of its history, Thailand opted for an indirect form of representation, with citizens voting for politicians and political parties. The latest Senate election gave Thai citizens their first taste of direct democracy.The election has given the country some valuable lessons. Chief of which is that the multi-phase voting system did not prevent political parties and interest groups from dominating the election process.While many of the candidates who made the cut are known to be linked to parties that dominate the Lower House, a big chunk of the candidates come from the lower Northeast, particularly around Buri Ram, a bastion of the Bhumjaithai Party.Meanwhile, most of the candidates who billed themselves as pro-democracy candidates are aligned with iLaw, a political group that supports monarchy reforms, revising the lese majeste law, and the junta-sponsored constitution-- the flagship policies of the Move Forward Party.There were accusations of vote buying and candidates voting among themselves. Many candidates also spoke to the media about how they were offered money and\\/or positions by political parties if they would vote for certain candidates.There were also reports that candidates stayed in the same hotels and held meetings to strategise before voting. While these activities do not violate election laws, it raises doubts about the fairness of the process.Another issue that only emerged after the election ended concerns the candidates' qualifications. Many people were shocked to learn that many candidates have limited experience in their fields, raising doubts about their ability to do their jobs and keep MPs in check.The election would have been more legitimate and successful had the EC encouraged more people to join the process. The EC's sub-par public campaign prior to the election, combined with the steep 2,500-baht registration fee, meant only 48,000 people signed up, far below the 100,000 the EC had predicted would join the race.Lawmakers will need to revise the system to make it more inclusive, if they wish to use the highly-complex model again in the future.Now, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. No matter who they are and where they come from, the new senators must prove that they are better than the outgoing, junta-appointed senators by supporting democratic principles and by proving they aren't simply proxies of political groups.",

    "text": "Los habitantes de Salt Lake City, Utah, tendrán que sacar sus abrigos del armario ante la llegada de un potencial frente frío a la región que podría bajar las temperaturas drásticamente a partir de la próxima semana, de acuerdo con el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional de Estados Unidos (NWS, por sus siglas en inglés). Los meteorólogos señalan que las condiciones han sido más secas de lo habitual en la región, lo que podría propiciar que el frente frío baje las temperaturas hasta los 4 grados centígrados (40 grados Fahrenheit). “Este fin de semana, las condiciones cálidas y secas volverán al final de la semana, justo antes del cambio de una secuencia dramática el próximo fin de semana”, explicó un funcionario del NWS a través de una publicación en X (antes Twitter). “Se esperan temperaturas aún más frías debido a una tormenta a principios de la próxima semana, con nieve en las montañas y lluvia en el valle. En los próximos días, se proporcionará información más detallada\", agregaron. Salt Lake City terminó octubre con el mes más cálido registrado, una mala señal de la que advierten los meteorólogos podría impactar significativamente para el inicio de la llegada de los frentes fríos. “Se estima que el frente frío llegará a finales del lunes o martes. Algunos de los efectos comenzarán a sentirse el lunes, en compañía de algunas lluvias ligeras y temperaturas más cálidas; sin embargo, los efectos completos no se sentirán hasta el martes”, indicó Hayden Mahan, meteoróloga del NWS, para la revista Newsweek. La experta también señaló que se esperan lluvias generalizadas en el valle, acompañadas de nieve en las montañas y temperaturas cercanas a los 4 °C (40 °F). Actualmente, el otoño ha estado bastante seco para esta época del año, y la meteoróloga destacó que septiembre fue uno de los meses menos normales en mucho tiempo. También expuso que gran parte de Utah está irregularmente seca. Estas condiciones podrían favorecer el surgimiento de incendios forestales en el noreste, además de intensificar el frío que se espera en la llegada del invierno.",

    "title": "Justin Welby says Church should have asked 'more questions' over former Post Office boss' role",
    "text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury has said more questions should have been asked about the former CEO of the Post Office's involvement in the Church of England. Paula Vennells who is an Anglican priest, has been strongly criticised for her handling of the Horizon software scandal in which hundreds of branch managers were prosecuted for theft and fraud as a result of faulty computer software. A month before Vennells resigned from the Post Office in February 2019, she was appointed to the C of E’s Ethical Investment Advisory Group. She also held three other senior advisory Church positions, including reporting on the implementation of the Church Buildings Review. She is also believed to have been short-listed to become Bishop of London in 2017. The Archbishop’s comments were in response to a question submitted ahead of this weekend’s meeting of the General Synod in London. Most Rev Justin Welby was asked whether the Church Nominations Commission had been informed of a High Court claim by sub-postmasters against the Post Office when it considered Ms Vennells’ application to become a bishop. He replied: “As has been said more generally about Paula Vennells' involvement in various committees and working groups in the Church of England, by 2019 and 2020, it is clear that more questions should have been asked about the appropriateness of that involvement when more had come to light about the Horizon scandal. We recognise this and will need to reflect on it.” Between 1999 and 2015 more than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted because of the faulty Horizon software. Vennells was awarded a CBE for services to the Post Office, which she handed back in January. She has been contacted for comment.",
