    "text": "Press Release German National Stationed in Northern Virginia Sentenced for Receiving Child Sexual Abuse Material from the BitTorrent File-Sharing Network Wednesday, April 9, 2025 For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs A German national, who worked in an IT position for the German military’s United States outpost in northern Virginia, was sentenced today to six years and six months in prison for downloading child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\nPeter Markus Kuttke, 49, a German national residing in Reston, pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 to receiving CSAM. According to court documents, law enforcement learned that CSAM files were available for download on Bit-Torrent, a file-sharing network, from a user with an IP address associated with Kuttke’s residence. On Dec. 1, 2023, federal agents executed a search warrant at Kuttke’s home and recovered electronic devices that contained evidence of Kuttke’s offenses, including a device with numerous CSAM videos and images. Forensic analysis further confirmed that Kuttke had downloaded CSAM from BitTorrent, including videos depicting adults sexually assaulting prepubescent children.\nMatthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert for the Eastern District of Virginia; and Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Heck, of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE HSI) Washington, D.C made the announcement.\nHSI investigated the case.\nTrial Attorney Nadia Prinz of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alessandra Serano for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case.\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

    "text": "A local rapper is hoping to teach and inspire young artists and musicians in his hometown. Bryan ‘Bioson’ Delaronde is an independent hip hop artist from Williams Lake who has been performing and producing music for more than a decade. Recently, he has started doing workshops for kids who are interested in learning more about the music industry. Delaronde holds the youth music and videography workshops at Skyline Alternate School where he teaches kids how to write and record music, shoot music videos and perform live. His friend, fellow Williams Lake hip hop artist Cassidy ‘CassCity’ Porter, whom he recently collaborated with on a new song, has played a big role in helping kick-start the workshops and mentor the kids. Together, they have helped over 20 kids learn how to write and record music, and they have even had some of the kids collaborate with them on music videos. “It’s been very rewarding, and I feel like we’re helping build confidence and and teaching the kids skills they can apply in everyday life, like video editing, audio editing and writing,” Delaronde said. “It’s been very progressive.” As for his music career, Delaronde got his start at the age of 15 when he stated writing lyrics as a way to channel his emotions into something creative. “It was a tough time for me around that time,” he said. “Eventually, I started recording songs, [and] after that I started performing at shows and it snowballed into me getting massive opportunities.” Delaronde says his sound and style has changed a lot over the past few years, and as he gets older, his taste in music constantly changes. “I wouldn’t even round it up to one genre anymore, although most would say it’s rap,” he said. “I’ve made club tracks, heavy metal tracks, pop, R&B tracks and even experimented in songs that. were borderline country music.” He goes on to explain that it all depends on the topic and who he is collaborating with, but he is always striving to make every song a little bit different than the last. He has been travelling across B.C. over the past few months, doing shows in Prince George, Vernon and Vancouver. He recently opened for award-winning Canadian rapper, singer and producer k-os, and will be opening for other Canadian artists at upcoming shows around the province. In recent years, he has toured with four-time JUNO Award-winning Vancouver hip hop group Swollen Members, as well as rappers Dax and Junk. Delaronde said he never imagined he would open for and collaborate with some of the biggest names in the industry, but perhaps his biggest collaboration is with the one he will have for the rest of his life — the one with his daughter Marcy. “I love recording with my daughter,” he said. “To be able to show my daughter how to make music and bring her on stage time to time is very special to me and her.” Delaronde is currently working on his fifth album, and like all of his music, it will be available on his YouTube, Amazon Music and Spotify channels. He has also been working on other singles and projects, and has about 25 new unreleased songs ready to go. “I recently collaborated with Eazy-E’s son, which was pretty cool,” he recalled. “I’m also launching a podcast series, Bioson’s Podcast, and I’ve been bringing guests on from all walks of life — music, boxing, DJs.” The first episode of the podcast featured Williams Lake boxer Stuart McLellan. Delaronde draws his inspiration from his supporters who often ask for music and share ideas and stories about how some songs help get them through hard times. “That’s such a blessing in itself and definitely helps me get projects done quicker,” he said. “I’m very fortunate to have the support system I do and couldn’t be more thankful.” Aside from workshops, recording music and shooting videos with out-of-town artists, and performing across the province, Delaronde is still looking for new ways to grow his brand. He has stared getting into merchandise, and hopes it will help lead into a full-time opportunity. “Ultimately, I’d love to start a business of some sort in the future and hopefully combine all these hobbies, skills and connections into something I could do as full-time work,” he explained. “Right now, I’m just enjoying the process and trying to help other artists fulfill their visions.” Delaronde also mentions how failure can happen constantly in this business, whether it’s making a song or doing a show. “Making a song in itself is a big process to do right [and] if you throw a video into the mix there’s been more room for failure,” he said. “With shows, it’s the same thing. They don’t see that behind the scenes, I’ve made dozens of phone calls, sent out emails and messages and got rejected or it just wasn’t reasonable.” He goes on to add that failure is all part of the journey, and he’s taking it all in stride and enjoying the ride. “I have no big expectations for music,” he said. “I’m just enjoying the cool opportunities and the process of creating projects as well as getting the chance to meet amazing people.” READ MORE: Local talent shines at Hometown Hip-Hop concert",

Così Elena Donazzan.\nSecondo l’esponente meloniana, il matrimonio “purtroppo è anche una legalizzazione, un contratto sociale che dà molti diritti agli sposi”.\nElena Donazzan\nSempre secondo l’assessora, questo è da considerare un problema perché “la nostra società può essere sicuramente multietnica, ma non multiculturale”.\n“Culture così diverse ravvicinate – ha sostenuto Donazzan – possono rivelarsi un problema in un periodo caratterizzato da forte terrorismo. La colpa è la nostra, l’Italia si sta ‘scristianizzando'”.\nLe reazioni dal mondo politico\nLe frasi di Donazzan non sono passate inosservate. Così, tramite una nota, la deputata Pd Ouidad Bakkali: “\nLa competizione Vannacci-Fdi sta generando dei mostri“.\n“La presidente Meloni – ha aggiunto la dem – prenda immediatamente le distanze e condanni le parole dell’assessore regionale veneto all’istruzione e al lavoro, Elena Donazzan”.\nÈ allucinante che chi sta governando del nostro paese si affianchi a persone che pronunciano frasi razziste e xenofobe che sembrano provenire dal medioevo”, ha concluso Bakkali.\nAnche Italia Viva, attraverso la coordinatrice nazionale Raffaella Paita, ha esternato indignazione: “Non si può pensare di governare un paese con una classe dirigente che ha nei luoghi comuni e, peggio ancora, nei pregiudizi le basi della propria identità politica”.",

    "text": "Should I Keep Aquarium Plants in Their Pots? A Comprehensive Guide The short answer is generally no , you shouldn’t keep most aquarium plants in their pots. While it might seem convenient, the pots and the rock wool or other materials they contain are usually intended for the plant’s initial propagation and transport, not for long-term growth within your aquarium. Removing the plant from the pot and carefully cleaning the roots will allow it to establish itself more naturally and thrive in your tank environment. However, there are some exceptions, which we’ll explore in detail.\nWhy Remove Plants From Their Pots? Most aquarium plants arrive in small plastic pots filled with rock wool . This material is used to provide support and moisture during shipping, but it’s often nutrient-poor and can restrict root growth once submerged in the aquarium. Here’s a breakdown of the issues:\nRestricted Root Growth: The confined space of the pot limits the plant’s ability to develop a robust root system. This hinders its ability to absorb nutrients from the substrate and anchor itself securely. Anaerobic Conditions: Rock wool can become compacted over time, leading to anaerobic conditions (lack of oxygen) within the pot. This can cause root rot and ultimately kill the plant. Nutrient Depletion: The rock wool itself doesn’t provide long-term nutrition for the plant. While some pre-fertilized options exist, they are not designed for sustained growth within an aquarium. Hiding Place for Detritus: The pot and rock wool can trap decaying organic matter (detritus), contributing to poor water quality in your aquarium. Inhibits Spreading: Plants that naturally spread via runners (like Sagittaria subulata or dwarf sag) are unable to do so when confined to a pot. Aesthetics: Often, the pot itself is not very attractive. Removing the plant and planting it directly in the substrate allows for a more natural and visually appealing aquascape. Exceptions to the Rule While removing plants from their pots is generally recommended, there are a few exceptions where keeping them potted might be acceptable or even beneficial:\nEasy Planters or Similar Decorations: Some aquarium decorations are specifically designed to hold potted plants. These “easy planters” often provide a more natural look than the original plastic pot and can make it easier to move or rearrange plants in the tank. Certain Rhizome Plants: Plants like Anubias and Java Fern are epiphytes, meaning they naturally grow attached to rocks or driftwood, not rooted in the substrate. While they don’t need to be in pots, keeping them in a small pot with inert gravel can make it easier to move them around or quarantine them if necessary. Just make sure the rhizome (the thick horizontal stem) is not buried, as this will cause it to rot. Temporary Quarantine: If you suspect a new plant might be carrying pests or diseases, you can keep it in its pot for a short period in a separate quarantine tank for observation before introducing it to your main aquarium. Floating Plants: Floating plants, by definition, don’t need to be planted in substrate or placed in pots. How to Remove Plants From Their Pots Properly Removing aquarium plants from their pots requires a gentle approach to avoid damaging the roots. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\nGently Remove the Plant: Carefully pull the plant out of the pot, wiggling it gently if necessary. Avoid yanking, as this can break the roots. Remove the Rock Wool: This is the most crucial and often the most challenging step. Submerge the root ball in a bucket of clean aquarium water. Gently tease the rock wool apart with your fingers, rinsing it frequently to dislodge any remaining fibers. Use tweezers to remove any stubborn pieces. The goal is to remove as much of the rock wool as possible without damaging the roots. Trim the Roots (Optional): If the roots are very long or tangled, you can trim them slightly with sharp scissors. This encourages new growth and helps the plant establish itself more quickly. Inspect for Pests: Examine the plant carefully for any signs of snails, algae, or other pests. Dip the plant in a diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 19 parts water) for a few minutes to kill any unwanted hitchhikers. Rinse thoroughly before planting. Plant in the Substrate: Finally, plant the plant in your aquarium substrate, ensuring that the roots are properly buried but the crown (where the leaves emerge) is exposed. Caring for Potted Aquarium Plants (When Allowed) If you choose to keep certain plants in pots, it’s crucial to take extra steps to ensure their health:\nUse Inert Substrate: Fill the pot with inert gravel or sand that won’t decompose or release harmful substances into the water. Avoid using garden soil or other substrates not specifically designed for aquariums. Fertilize Regularly: Potted plants rely on the water column for nutrients, so regular fertilization is essential. Use a liquid fertilizer specifically formulated for aquarium plants. Monitor Water Quality: Potted plants can contribute to nutrient imbalances in the aquarium, so monitor water parameters regularly and perform water changes as needed. Clean the Pots: Periodically remove the pots and clean them to remove any accumulated detritus. Repot as Needed: As the plant grows, it may outgrow its pot. Repot it into a larger container as necessary. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions related to aquarium plants and their care:\n1. Do aquarium plants need substrate? While some plants (like rhizome plants and floating plants) can survive without substrate, most aquarium plants benefit greatly from being planted in a nutrient-rich substrate. Aquarium soil provides essential nutrients and minerals, helps to stabilize pH, GH, and KH levels, and provides a surface for beneficial bacteria to grow.\n2. How do I keep aquarium plants alive without substrate? For rhizome plants like Anubias and Java Fern, attach them to rocks or driftwood using fishing line or aquarium-safe glue. Floating plants simply need to be placed on the water surface, provided with adequate light and liquid fertilizers, and protected from strong currents.\n3. What is the lifespan of aquarium plants? The lifespan of aquarium plants varies depending on the species. Some plants may only last a few months, while others can live for several years with proper care. Regularly prune and remove dead leaves to promote healthy growth.\n4. Is it OK to leave dead plants in the aquarium? It’s generally best to remove dead plant leaves from the aquarium. Decaying plant matter can contribute to ammonia buildup and degrade water quality.\n5. How often should you change aquarium plants? Healthy aquarium plants can last several months to a few years before needing replacement. Replace plants when they show signs of decline or are no longer thriving.\n6. Can aquarium plants grow in just gravel? While gravel can help anchor plants down, it doesn’t provide the essential nutrients needed for optimal growth. For a fully planted tank, a nutrient-rich aquarium soil is recommended.\n7. Should I remove the cotton/wool from aquarium plants? Yes, always remove the rock wool from aquarium plants before planting them in your aquarium. As mentioned earlier, it can restrict root growth, create anaerobic conditions, and trap detritus.\n8. How do I make my aquarium plants happy? To keep your aquarium plants healthy and thriving, maintain water stability, provide adequate lighting, add necessary nutrients through fertilization, and prune regularly.\n9. Do plants grow better in pots or in the ground? In general, plants grow better in the ground because they have access to a larger volume of soil, more stable temperatures, and a more extensive root system. However, with proper care, some plants can thrive in pots as well.\n10. Can I keep plants in plastic containers? Yes, you can keep plants in plastic containers, but ensure the containers are food-grade plastic or specifically designed for plants to prevent leaching of harmful chemicals. For aquarium plants in pots, use inert substrates like gravel or sand.\n11. How do you remove plants from pots? Tap the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen the plant. If necessary, use a chopstick or dowel to push the root ball out through the drainage holes. Be gentle to avoid damaging the roots.\n12. What kills plants in a fish tank? Several factors can kill plants in a fish tank, including phosphate deficiency, lack of light, poor water quality, and herbivorous fish.\n13. What are the cons of having live plants in an aquarium? The cons of having live plants include the need for proper lighting, nutrient supplementation, and maintenance. Some fish species may also uproot or eat the plants.\n14. Do dead aquarium plants cause ammonia? Yes, decaying organic matter, including dead plant leaves, can contribute to ammonia buildup in the aquarium.\n15. Do aquarium plants need light all day? Aquarium plants need light for photosynthesis, but they don’t necessarily need light all day. A photoperiod of 8-12 hours per day is generally sufficient. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can promote algae growth. Check out The Environmental Literacy Council at https://enviroliteracy.org/ for more information about aquariums and living things.\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a thriving planted aquarium that enhances the beauty and health of your aquatic environment. Remember to research the specific needs of each plant species to ensure optimal growth and success.",

    "text": "ALIGARH : A three-day international conference on “Climate Change: Resilient Society and Sustainable Development”, organized by the Department of Geography, Aligarh Muslim University concluded with the exchange of ideas, research and strategies to address climate change-related global challenges. Addressing the valedictory session as the chief guest, Prof Arun Kumar Singh, Registrar, Banaras Hindu University highlighted the increasing frequency and intensity of climate change-induced weather events, which disproportionately impact developing and low-income countries, which are reliant on climate-sensitive resources. They are at heightened risk of poverty, inequality, food insecurity, and health crises caused by climate hazards, he added. The guest of honour, Prof. B.S. Chaudhury, Chairman, Department of Geophysics, Kurukshetra University, highlighted the urgent need for worldwide action to achieve a climate-resilient and sustainable world. He said that a comprehensive framework known as Climate Resilient Development (CRD) has been proposed, combining climate adaptation strategies with greenhouse gas emissions reduction to support sustainable development. The Dean, Faculty of Science, Prof. Sartaj Tabassum emphasized the significance of Climate Resilient Development Pathways (CRDP) in fostering sustainable development, poverty reduction, and inequality alleviation while also meeting adaptation and mitigation targets. Earlier, welcoming the guests, Prof Nizamuddin Khan, Chairman of the department and Convener of the programme highlighted the diversity of papers presented during the conference which addressed various climate-related issues faced in different regions of the world and especially in India. He highlighted the conference’s key conclusion, which called for community participation in tackling climate change and engaging local communities in the decision-making process for inclusive, practical, and sustainable development. The conference also emphasized the need for adopting modern technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, in managing climate-related challenges. Dr Saleha Jamal presented a brief report on the conference and pointed out that 26 technical sessions and two special memorial lecture sessions were organized, and about 300 papers were presented in different technical sessions by scholars, scientists, policymakers, delegates from across India, and international participants from Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Ethiopia. Prof. Nigar Alam Siddiqui proposed a vote of thanks while Dr. Ahmad Mujtaba conducted the valedictory function.",

    "text": "Segundo a Organização Mundial da Saúde, o Brasil é o país com maior prevalência de depressão na América Latina e o segundo lugar no continente americano. A depressão é a principal causa de incapacidade em todo o mundo e estima-se que mais de 300 milhões de pessoas, de todas as idades, sofram com esse transtorno.\nJá não é segredo para a ciência que, se você quer manter os sintomas da depressão afastados, uma das melhores opções é se exercitar. Atividades aeróbicas, musculação, yoga e tai chi eram algumas das opções mais recomendadas. Agora, um estudo sugere que a caminhada também pode manter a depressão sob controle.\nFeito por um grupo de pesquisadores espanhóis, o estudo é uma revisão global de dados. Os cientistas em questão pegaram 33 outras pesquisas que faziam ligações entre números de passos e saúde mental e analisaram seus dados. A revisão cobriu 33 estudos envolvendo 96 mil adultos ao redor do mundo – eles usavam dispositivos de monitoramento para calcular seus passos diários e faziam acompanhamento psicológico.\nRelacionadas Ikigai: Conheça o segredo japonês para uma vida longa e feliz Existem três tipos de burnout. Conheça o burnout por tédio A tirania da positividade Os sintomas de depressão costumam ser sentimentos de incapacidade, irritabilidade, pessimismo, perda de prazer, déficit cognitivo, baixa autoestima e tristeza, que interferem bastante na vida diária. Ela também afeta a capacidade do paciente de trabalhar, dormir, estudar, comer, socializar, entre outros.\nPesquisadores já notaram evidências de que exercícios de qualquer tipo podem funcionar como um antidepressivo natural. Mas será que uma atividade tão simples como uma caminhada teria um efeito similar?\nContinua após a publicidade Segundo o estudo espanhol, aumentar o número de passos diários, mesmo em níveis modestos, já é associado a uma redução nos sintomas depressivos.\nPresumindo que uma pessoa ande, normalmente, 5 mil passos por dia, quem deu mil passos a mais teve uma queda de 9% nas chances de desenvolver depressão.\nEsses benefícios aumentaram rapidamente: em comparação com pessoas que caminhavam 5 mil passos diários ou menos, aquelas que caminhavam 7 mil passos por dia tiveram uma probabilidade 31% menor de depressão, segundo o estudo. Acima de 7,5 mil passos, a prevalência de depressão foi 43% menor.\nContinua após a publicidade Essas tendências se mantiveram verdadeiras para todas as faixas etárias, tanto em mulheres quanto em homens.\nDepois dos 10 mil passos diários, a curva de redução dos sintomas depressivos deu uma estagnada, e os benefícios nesse quesito deixaram de ser tão significativos.\n“Estabelecer metas para o número de passos diários pode ser uma estratégia de saúde pública promissora e inclusiva para a prevenção da depressão”, concluíram os autores do estudo.\nContinua após a publicidade As descobertas foram publicadas no periódico JAMA Network Open .\nCompartilhe essa matéria via: WhatsAPP Telegram Publicidade Mais lidas 1 Sociedade PIS/Pasep 2025: Governo divulga o calendário de pagamento do abono salarial 2 Finanças pessoais O ano virou.

    "title": "Juicio por YPF: Argentina presentó los argumentos para evitar que Burford tome el control",
    "text": "Burford, principal beneficiario de la condena en primera instancia contra la Argentina por haber expropiado mal [Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF)](https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/tags/487/yacimientos-petroliferos-fiscales) en 2012, le pidió a la jueza [Loretta Preska](https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/1036771/economia/juicio-ypf-justicia-estados-unidos-busca-embargarle-bienes-argentina.html) quedarse con el control del 51% de las acciones de petrolera que están en manos del Estado. Aunque las posibilidades que que el pedido avance son bajas, podrían prosperar. El bufet sabe que no podrá cobrar el fallo de Preska que indicó que Argentina debe desembolsar U$S16.000 millones, y quiere sentarse a negociar con un que hasta ahora no dio señales de querer hacerlo, más allá de los dichos del presidente Javier Milei quien dijo meses atrás que había “voluntad de pago”. En ese contexto, el estudio inglés pidió formalmente las acciones de la empresa y embargar activos locales en el exterior, dos medidas que avanzan en el estrado de Preska mientras, en paralelo, Argentina defiende su postura en Corte de Apelaciones del Segundo Circuito de Nueva York con la intención de revertir la condena de la magistrada que reemplazó al fallecido Thomas Griesa, consignó un artículo del portal [Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/economia/2024/06/27/juicio-por-ypf-los-4-argumentos-que-presento-argentina-para-evitar-que-burford-tome-el-control-de-la-petrolera/). Hoy se conocieron los argumentos de la defensa local que presentaron en Nueva York cinco abogados de Sullivan & Cromwell, el estudio que representa al país en EEUU en esa causa y que sigue los lineamientos de la Procuración del Tesoro, a cargo de Rodolfo Barra. Se trata de tecnicismos con los que, a grandes rasgos, el Estado busca convencer a Preska de que no puede embargar activos locales en el exterior, ni transferir acciones de la empresa y, sobre todo, que no puede actuar sobre un territorio soberano. Uno por uno, los argumentos presentados - “Esta Corte no puede ordenar a un soberano extranjero que actúe dentro de su propio territorio, y mucho menos ordenarle que viole o revise sus propias leyes”. Básicamente, se asegura que una corte foránea no puede obligar a otro país a repatriar activos. “Argentina dice que la doctrina de international comity prohíbe que una corte de EEUU ordene a estado extranjero hacer algo en su propio territorio. Sobre todo si implica violar o cambiar una ley (Ley 26.741 prohíbe transferir acciones de YPF expropiadas sin el voto 2/3 del Congreso)”, dijo en X Sebastián Soler, quien fue viceprocurador del Tesoro del gobierno de Alberto Fernández. - “El artículo 10 de la Ley de Expropiación de YPF no se limita a ‘la asignación de poderes entre el poder legislativo y ejecutivo de Argentina’”. “Argentina presenta informe experto del Dr. Alfonso Santiago (especialista en derecho constitucional) que explica que la prohibición de transferir las acciones expropiadas sin aprobación del Congreso aplica tanto a transferencias voluntarias como a las ordenadas judicialmente”, destacó Soler. Otra mitad de la biblioteca cree que la ley de expropiación hace referencia solo a “transferencias voluntarias”, como podría ser una venta, y no, como sucede en este caso, a una orden judicial. Fuentes cercanas a Burford creen que esa prohibición de transferencia no aplicaría ante una eventual orden de Preska. - “Los demandantes leyeron mal 28 U.S.C. 1610 para incluir propiedades soberanas ubicadas fuera de Estados Unidos”. “28 US Code 1610″ es una referencia al United States Code –la compilación y codificación de la legislación federal general de EEUU– que en su apartado 1610 hace referencia a “Excepciones a la inmunidad de embargo o ejecución”. “El Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act solo permite ejecutar ‘bienes en EEUU de un estado extranjero... usados para una actividad comercial en EEUU’. Las acciones expropiadas están en Argentina (registradas en Caja de Valores) y solo se usan para votar en asambleas en Argentina”, explicó Soler en X. Burford pide que Argentina transfiera a EEUU las acciones y luego se las entreguen. Quienes defienden la postura local creen que aún si esas acciones estuvieran por algún motivo en EEUU tampoco podrían ser embargadas porque el Estado local no las usa para una actividad comercial. “La excepción tampoco funciona para el caso en que YPF haya tomado deuda en EEUU. En ese caso la actividad comercial es de la empresa, no del Estado”, destacó un abogado que conoce la causa al detalle. - “Los demandantes se equivocan al afirmar que la República utilizó sus acciones [de YPF] para efectuar el incumplimiento del requisito de oferta pública de adquisición establecido en los estatutos de YPF”. “Argentina no usó las acciones expropiadas para incumplir el estatuto de YPF al no hacer la OPA porque según la propia sentencia de Preska el incumplimiento se produjo el 16 de abril de 2012 (Argentina lo cuestiona) y en esa fecha las acciones no habían sido expropiadas aún”, explicó Soler. “Son cuestiones técnicas, pero sólidas. Argentina dice que hay que cumplir con las leyes internacionales y que se debe mantener el respeto entre países soberanos. Pero es verdad que el año pasado Preska ya dijo que tiene el poder de repatriar activos en el caso de Bainbridge (un holdout) cuando rechazó el pedido de repatriar activos porque ese fondo no había podido identificarlos. Los beneficiarios del fallo ahora identificaron esos activos, es decir, las acciones de YPF. Entonces Preska podría decir que sí puede ordenar la repatriación. Como sea, hay que esperar a ver cómo sigue el caso”, destacó Sebastián Maril, de Latin Advisors. Sobre el juicio, Marial destacó que Argentina está siguiendo la misma estrategia legal que ha utilizado en el pasado. “Dejar que las cortes hablen hasta agotar toda instancia legal disponible. En el mientras tanto, evita dialogar con los beneficiarios de los fallos quienes pueden ofrecer un acuerdo mucho más adecuado que el que siempre terminamos pagando por agotar toda instancia legal disponible. Argentina comenzó la apelación de YPF el año pasado y no habrá decisión de la corte hasta el año que viene. Mientras tanto, sumamos intereses por USD 840 millones anuales y no aprovechamos una oportunidad de negociar acuerdos menores. Hoy, me atrevo a decir que se puede negociar un importante descuento de los USD 16.100 millones más intereses”, detalló.",
