    "text": "Tourism Western Australia has awarded The Brand Agency its new Creative Services contract to continue bringing Walking On A Dream to the world. The contract was awarded effective 20 March 2024 and will be in place for up to five years.\nTourism WA and The Brand Agency worked together to launch the highly successful Walking On A Dream destination brand for Western Australia in September 2022. Since the new brand launch in September 2022, annual visitor spend in Western Australia increased by around 36 per cent from $12.27 billion to $17.7 billion in December 2023.\nIn November 2023, Tourism WA and The Brand Agency were nominated for an ARIA Music Award for Best Use of an Australian Recording in an Advertisement category after Empire Of The Sun rerecorded their hit single “Walking On A Dream” to support the brand.\nTourism WA managing director Carolyn Turnbull said she was delighted to continue the agency’s partnership with The Brand Agency following the success of the destination brand. “Walking On A Dream has been truly embraced by the tourism industry in Western Australia, so we will be proud to again work in partnership with The Brand Agency to continue to deliver this inspiring and unified brand and bring even more visitors to Western Australia, the Dream State”.\n“The Brand Agency will strengthen Western Australia’s global brand to drive awareness, consideration, and conversion and help us achieve our vision for Western Australia to be recognised as a world-class destination, immersing people in our unique cultures, communities and environment”.\nWalking On A Dream has launched across major global cities including London, New York, Singapore, and Tokyo and will continue to be the global brand platform for the next five years.\nThe Brand Agency business director Brendon Lewis said working with Tourism WA on the development and global rollout of Walking On A Dream has been an incredible experience for everyone at the agency.\n“Knowing we can continue to evolve the brand is exciting, we can’t wait to see where we take it.

El compromiso del gobernador es seguir articulando acciones para la seguridad de los santandereanos. El Consorcio Ortiz dará este viernes la respuesta sobre la evaluación de nuevas órdenes de servicio y, de ser positiva, el lunes se reactivarán los contratos de 32 personas que estaban suspendidos”, señaló Hernández.\nComo parte de los acuerdos, el próximo 22 de agosto se instalará una mesa de alto nivel con el Ministerio de Transporte, el Ministerio de Trabajo, la ANI, el contratista, la comunidad, la Defensoría del Pueblo, la Procuraduría, la Gobernación y la Alcaldía de Sabana de Torres, con el fin de buscar una solución definitiva a la situación laboral de los volqueteros y evitar nuevos bloqueos.",

Oops ... that was then, this is now. Illinois and Chicago never anticipated the flood of Latin Americans, Pakistanis, Africans and who knows who else coming across the wide-open border. Now, Chicago and other towns are ticketing and fining bus companies for dropping migrants wherever. Yes, being a sanctuary state sounds good if there are no migrants to deal with. Well, Pritzker and Johnson now know how towns in Texas feel ... overwhelmed by the tidal wave of people pouring across the Rio Grande. Not such a good idea after all. Biden and company have screwed up the immigration process, that was working, into a a problem that will take decades to repair. Joe and Kamala have produced quite a legacy.

    "title": "Why Distancing Yourself From A Gemini Man Could Backfire",
    "text": "Gemini men often get a bad rap in the zodiac world. They’re labeled as flighty, inconsistent, or even emotionally detached. And sure, if you’ve been burned by one, the idea of stepping back might seem tempting. But before you make that move, let’s talk about why distancing yourself from a Gemini man might actually be the wrong call.\nThe Myth of The “Unreliable” Gemini It’s easy to assume that because a Gemini man changes his mind often, he’s unreliable or insincere. But that’s not necessarily true. Geminis have Mercury calling the shots—yes, the chatty planet of communication—so their brains are always buzzing with ideas, questions, and a little bit of chaos. They explore ideas, shift perspectives, and crave mental stimulation—not because they’re flaky, but because they’re intellectually curious.\nIf you distance yourself simply because he seems inconsistent, you might be misreading his nature. A Gemini man’s adaptability is one of his greatest strengths. He can adjust to new situations effortlessly, making him an exciting and dynamic partner—if you know how to engage with him.\nYou’ll Miss Out on His Best Qualities A Gemini man is curious, witty, and endlessly entertaining. He’s the kind of person who can make even a mundane conversation feel like an adventure. If you pull away, you’re not just avoiding potential frustration—you’re also shutting the door on laughter, deep conversations, and spontaneous fun.\nInstead of distancing yourself, try meeting him where he is. Geminis appreciate partners who keep up with their energy rather than trying to slow them down.\nDistance Can Make Him Drift Further (Here’s Why) Gemini men don’t respond well to the silent treatment or emotional withdrawal. Here’s what actually happens when you pull away:\n1. He Assumes You’re Not Interested Geminis are social creatures who thrive on interaction. If you suddenly go distant, he won’t overanalyze it—he’ll take it at face value and move on.\n2. He Seeks Stimulation Elsewhere A bored or ignored Gemini will naturally look for engagement elsewhere—whether in friendships, new hobbies, or even other romantic interests. If you want to keep his attention, staying present (without being clingy) is crucial.\n3. He Doesn’t Like Emotional Games While some signs might chase after a partner who plays hard to get, Geminis prefer straightforwardness. If you want more from him, say so. If you’re upset, express it in a way that invites discussion rather than shutting down.\nWhat Happens When You Pull Away? When you shut down or retreat, a Gemini man won’t always chase. Unlike more emotionally intense signs (think Scorpio or Cancer), Geminis tend to match energy. If you withdraw, he might assume you’re no longer interested—and instead of fighting for your attention, he’ll simply move on to the next stimulating experience .\nSo, what’s the trick? Communication. If you need reassurance, just say so. If you’re feeling disconnected, bring it up in a playful, lighthearted way. A Gemini man appreciates honesty, but checks out under pressure or heavy emotional drama. If you distance yourself, he’ll likely mirror that and drift away too. Geminis reflect what they’re given.\nWhat To Do Instead of Distancing Yourself Rather than stepping back, try these approaches:\nEngage His Mind – Challenge him intellectually. Geminis love a good debate or a new idea to explore.\nKeep Things Light (At First) – Deep emotional expectations right away can overwhelm him. Let the connection develop naturally through fun, laughter, and great conversation. As trust builds, he’ll open up more.\nBe Spontaneous – Surprise him with an unplanned outing, a random debate, or a last-minute adventure. Geminis love partners who keep them on their toes.\nCommunicate Clearly (But Playfully) –If something bothers you, don’t sulk—bring it up in a way that feels like a discussion, not a confrontation. Geminis respond best to dialogue, not demands.\nFinal Thoughts: Give Him A Chance Gemini men aren’t for everyone—but if you’re willing to embrace their lively, ever-changing nature, you might just find one of the most exciting and dynamic partners out there. Instead of distancing yourself, try adapting to his rhythm. You might be surprised at how rewarding the connection can be.\nSo before you write him off, ask yourself: Is this really about him, or is it about my expectations? Sometimes, the best relationships aren’t the ones that fit neatly into a box—they’re the ones that keep you on your toes. And if anyone can do that, it’s a Gemini.",

Was I wrong to offer? GENTLE READER: New parents are told that their baby is upset for one of a very limited number of reasons. The menu for the new parents themselves may be slightly longer, but no good comes of your guessing the father’s look was meant to convey that you insulted their baby by reasonably offering a blanket.
