    "title": "¡Old Trafford tiene nuevo héroe! Remontada del Manchester United con 'hat-trick' de Amad Diallo",
    "text": "Old Trafford tiene nuevo héroe. Se llama Amad Diallo, tiene 22 años y es el líder absoluto de un club gigantesco como el Manchester United... pero que vive a la deriva desde hace años. En una noche que pintaba a drama, se echó el equipo a la espalda y, con un 'hat-trick', remontó para ganar 3-1 al Southampton.\nEl Southampton se plantaba en Old Trafford con poco o nada que perder. Colista destacado (seis puntos en 20 jornadas) y sin ganar en Premier desde el pasado 2 de noviembre. Pero la victoria en FA Cup les había dado alas. Y pusieron patas arriba el feudo del Manchester United hasta el minuto 90.\nFue otro partido a cara de perro de los de Amorim. Kamaldeen Sulemana dejó un 'show' en el Teatro de los Sueños regateando a todos los que se ponían por delante. Pero Onana le frenó a él, y a Dibling, con tres manos impecables. Con su propio compañero, sin embargo, no pudo. Ugarte, en un balón que le pegó en la espalda tras un saque de esquina muy bien sacado, superó al meta camerunés. Tanto en propia, 0-1 y silencio sepulcral en Mánchester.\nY si bien es cierto que los 'Red Devils' tuvieron el empate en una ocasión clamorosa que falló Antony a puerta vacía, Sulemana estaba desatado. Su gran noche. Perdonó al contragolpe el 0-2. Temblaba el United.\nSin embargo, al rescate apareció, llegando a tiempo, el de siempre esta temporada: Amad Diallo Traoré. Superó a un Ramsdale enorme para, en el minuto 82, empatar. Y no se iba a quedar ahí. En el minuto 90 firmó su doblete para remontar. Incluso le quedó tiempo para, en el minuto 93, firmar 'hat-trick'.\nLa insistencia acabó encontrado premio y Amad, mientras, sigue sumando: siete goles y siete asistencias esta temporada para la nueva joya del Manchester United. En esta ocasión, partiendo desde el carril derecho y absorbiendo todo el juego ofensivo del equipo de Amorim.\nEl Manchester United es 12º en Premier League con 26 puntos en 21 jornadas. Europa, mientras, sigue lejos: el sexto es el City, con 35 unidades.",

    "text": "BENZIE COUNTY, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- The Benzie County Sheriff's Office is investigating an incident that took place at the home of an elected official. Four rocks with religious messages written on them were thrown through multiple windows, sending glass everywhere and damaging the furniture inside. Amy Ferris and her husband live in a pretty secluded neighborhood. It's hard to reach their home, but that didn't stop someone from finding it and sending them a message. \"In my sleep I don't know what I thought it was, but my husband of course started screaming and I jumped out of bed,\" said Ferris. \"At first we I mean, it's so incomprehensible that somebody would do this to you. I thought it was a bear trying to break in.\" Ferris is the Crystal Lake Township Supervisor, and she's served as an elected official for more than a decade. In the early morning hours of May 18, she and her husband found their living area covered in shards of glass. Deputies arrived and pointed out to Ferris the rocks thrown through her living room had a message written on them: the word \"repent\" and a drawing of a cross. I don't know what this message really means. According to the deputy's report, the wording on the rocks leads him to believe this was \"a personal attack and potentially motivated by some moral/ethical conflict.\" Ferris believes the same. \"I don't think it was random. It was definitely targeting me,\" Ferris said. Ferris and the sheriff's office are unsure of a motive. In her role as an elected official, she said she's made a lot of decisions over the years that could've upset someone. \"I was scared to come in the room for most of the rest of the weekend,\" said Ferris. \"Just all of a sudden it was like a foreign territory to me. It's not a room that I wanted to go in.\"",

    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Windy and dry conditions Sunday AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - An incoming system is looking to bring high winds and dry conditions to the region. An approaching system will actually begin to kick up our winds on Saturday, with 20+ mph winds out of the southeast. Thanks to this element, humidity is higher on Saturday, keeping fire danger a little lower. Once the system gets closer Sunday, we’ll see higher, and drier winds. Winds will already be stout Sunday morning, but could be sustained around 30-40 mph by the afternoon, with gusts over 60 mph expected. This will cause visibility issues with blowing dust, and with relative humidity values down around 15%, critical fire danger will return. Thankfully, a cold front arrives late Sunday into Monday, that’ll drop temperatures and bring winds down as well. But until then, secure loose outdoor items, and practice smart fire safety.

    "text": "A Program in Wonders and the Exercise of Mindful Forgiveness A Program in Miracles (ACIM), a spiritual and philosophical text, is really a profound work that's had an important impact on the lives of countless individuals seeking a further understanding of themselves and the character of reality. Comprising around 1200 pages of thick substance, ACIM is a unique and extensive guide to inner transformation, forgiveness, and spiritual awakening. It was scribed by Helen Schucman, an investigation psychologist, and first printed in 1976, and it continues to resonate with individuals from all hikes of life. At the primary of A Course in Wonders is just a non-denominational way of spirituality that encourages pupils to issue their preconceived notions about fact, the self, and the world. The writing is divided in to three elements: the Text, the Book for Students, and the Handbook for Educators, each offering a different perception on the material presented. The key teachings of ACIM can be distilled in to many key principles. Among the main themes of ACIM is the idea of forgiveness. The Class teaches that forgiveness is not just pardoning some body for his or her wrongdoings, but rather, it's the acceptance that there's nothing a course in miracles podcast to forgive. It asserts that what we comprehend as wrongdoings are ultimately the result of our personal misperceptions and projections. In forgiving others, we are, actually, forgiving ourselves. ACIM highlights that forgiveness is really a road to internal peace and liberation from the burdens of resentment and anger. Yet another basic concept of A Class in Wonders may be the proven fact that the physical earth is definitely an illusion. It posits that our physical experiences are unreliable indicators of reality and that correct notion can just only be achieved via a change in consciousness. The Class distinguishes involving the \"real-world,\" which is a state of peace and oneness beyond the material realm, and the \"confidence earth,\" known by fear, separation, and conflict. According to ACIM, our main purpose is to awaken from the dream of the vanity earth and return to the consciousness of our heavenly nature. ACIM also introduces the idea of the Holy Heart as helpful tips and instructor within the individual. This spiritual existence is observed as the foundation of inspiration and wisdom, helping people produce possibilities that cause us closer to truth and away from illusion. The Class teaches that through our readiness to hear the Sacred Spirit's guidance, we are able to access a deeper understanding of our purpose and the road to healing.",

    "text": "Antioch will for the first time in history fly the Pan-African flag at City Hall through Juneteenth in honor of Black Americans who contributed to the enrichment of the community. Originally proposed as a Black History Month display, the flag flying was extended because it came on the agenda so late in the month on Feb. 27. Mayor Lamar Hernandez-Thorpe, who sets the agenda, requested an extension because of the delay, noting the requester – Antioch’s Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment – had done so in a timely fashion. “I reviewed the request and thought it was a great idea,” the mayor said of the flag flying in what is now one of the Bay Area’s most diverse cities. Mayor Pro-Tem Monica Wilson moved for approval, with an extension until Juneteenth, the June 19 holiday that commemorates the end of slavery. Unlike past requests for other flags, this one received unanimous support on Tuesday. After much controversy, Antioch approved its first flag flying policy on a split vote in 2022, allowing the Progress Pride flag to be flown for the first time outside City Hall. All flag requests must now come before the council for approval before being flown. “If there are any flags that are requested to be flown in the interim, we can certainly fly them as well,” Hernandez-Thorpe said. “So this does not preclude other flags from being flown.” Some other area cities that fly the Pan-African flag include Richmond, Emeryville, Oakland and Tracy. Leslie May told the council she was proud of her heritage, which is African and Native American, and she would like to see the flag flown all year. “I would like to see this flown in honor of me, my ancestors before me and the ancestors before them,” she said. “Since we were forced to come over here to this land, we lost our opportunity for the real (African) flag to be flown.” Antioch-ACCE member Tachina Garrett thanked the council for raising the flag. “This flag was created to give Black people in America and the world a symbol that unifies the diaspora,” she said. “The red, which symbolizes our blood that was shed. The black symbolizes those bodies that were beaten and burned and everything else, and the green represents the land that was stolen.” The Pan-African flag was developed by activist Marcus Garvey and others in response to racism as a symbol to connect people of African descent across the world. It is also known as the Black Liberation flag and the Afro-American flag, and was adopted by the UNIA at a conference in New York City in 1920.",

    "text": "Guerra Israele-Hamas, a Bari in marcia per la pace. Il vescovo: \"Coltiviamo un'ostinata speranza\" Una marcia per la pace. Per dire “basta” alla violenza che si sta consumando in Medio Oriente. Per un immediato cessate il fuoco, la fine del conflitto a Gaza, la liberazione di tutti gli ostaggi e dei prigionieri civili. La manifestazione organizzata nel pomeriggio del 29 dicembre dall’arcidiocesi di Bari-Bitonto e dal Comitato per la pace di Terra di Bari, senza bandiere o schieramenti politici, ha attraversato il lungomare con partenza da piazza Diaz e arrivo a largo Chiurlia per lanciare un messaggio verso il nuovo anno: “Dobbiamo coltivare una ostinata speranza – spiega mentre cammina in testa al corteo monsignor Giuseppe Satriano, arcivescovo di Bari-Bitonto – soprattutto in questo tempo in cui la guerra sembra fiorire ovunque. La guerra in Medio Oriente richiede un atteggiamento di denuncia: bisogna riunirsi per costruire soluzioni di pace, la pace non è solo un dono ma è un impegno”. Circa un migliaio i manifestanti in strada. “La nostra è la città di San Nicola – ha aggiunto il sindaco Antonio Decaro, affiancato dall’assessora al Welfare Francesca Bottalico – da qui ricordiamo la fratellanza e la solidarietà. A San Nicola ci affidiamo con questa volontà” di Daniele Leuzzi video di Carlo Tesser e Michele Piscitelli",
