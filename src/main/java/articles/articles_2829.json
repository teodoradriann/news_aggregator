    "text": "As its name suggests, the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut has the sea — or, rather, the Mystic River — right at its door. While the relationship between the museum and the river has been mostly harmonious, rising water levels are now prompting significant protective changes. Flooding at the museum site has been more frequent than ever. Historically, it might happen a few times a year. Now, flooding is a monthly or weekly occurrence, according to April reporting from the New York Times. First opening to the public in the 1930s , the museum was built on the Atlantic Ocean at the low-lying site of what once was a shipyard. Constructed on the water, it was not designed to withstand today's rising seas. At the moment, most of the museum's campus is considered a critical flood zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Even the highest points are only 14 feet above sea level, per the New York Times, making floods an inevitability. \"Flooding often submerges walkways throughout the campus,\" the paper noted , \"preventing visitors from accessing buildings and experiences.\" As noted by the Times, researchers expect sea levels in the area to rise 20 inches by 2050. \"It might not be 2050,\" Chad Frost told the publication, \"but this isn't a question of 'if,' but rather 'when.'\" The architectural expert has been collaborating with the museum for years, focusing on flood resilience since 2020. Rising sea levels primarily stem from human-caused pollution, which traps heat in our atmosphere and can cause Arctic ice melting and water to expand . In the context of the Mystic River shoreline, the higher water levels can supercharge flooding events, making them more frequent and more destructive. As temperatures increase worldwide, we can expect more intense climate shocks , including not only floods but also hurricanes and fires . Museums beyond Connecticut are making preparations to survive wildfires and extreme floods too. At the Louvre in Paris, France, artworks not on display can be stored off-site at a higher elevation, according to KRTV. Do you think your house could withstand a hurricane? No way Maybe a weak one I'm not sure It definitely could Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. \"This is a slow building crescendo that gets worse the longer we wait,\" Frost continued , referring to the peril at Mystic Seaport's doorstep. \"The clock is ticking,\" he added. The New York Times reported that, for the past five years, the museum has been implementing new methods for protecting its historical artifacts, including coastal barrier fortification and plans for building elevation. Specialists are also relocating some of the buildings. However, some operations are tied to the waterfront — like the historic watercrafts on display — and if coastal levels continue to rise, those materials could be lost or damaged. To protect the vulnerable Mystic River coast and so many others, we need to address the proliferation of heat-trapping pollution that exacerbates sea level rise and flooding events. Some steps you can take include lowering the amount of energy you consume that's fueled by burning dirty energy sources like oil, coal, and gas. Coordinating with your community can also maximize your impact. More actions to take at the community level include those similar to the efforts that Frost has helped the museum to pursue, like flood-risk assessment. Advocating for infrastructural plans and local investments to help make your neighborhood safer can reduce the costs — financial and otherwise — of flood recovery efforts down the line.

    "text": "As the new year begins, it’s good to set aside time and ask God for wisdom. Proverbs 9:10 tells us, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\nThis doesn’t mean we’re afraid of God; it means we are in absolute awe of His majesty, how He works through generations, and how the impossible becomes possible if we simply obey Him.\nThe fear of the Lord is first mentioned in the story of Abraham, who is often called the father of our faith. In Genesis 15:1, God gave him the wonderful promise:\n“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.” When Abraham replied that he was childless, God promised that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars.\nThen comes a verse that is key to the book of Romans, to all of Paul’s theology, and to the entire Reformation:\nAnd he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6). This gets rid of all legalism. As long as we believe God, He will account it to us for righteousness.\nAbraham’s story doesn’t stop here. Yes, we are justified by faith; yet faith without works is dead. God called Abraham to take Isaac—the son of the promise—and sacrifice him. Abraham obeyed, concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead (Hebrews 11:19).\nThat’s when the angel of the Lord stopped him with these profound words:\n“Now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me” (Genesis 22:12) Abraham didn’t withhold his best from the Lord, and God didn’t withhold His best from us. John 3:16 tells us,\n“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.” When we place our lives in His hands and trust Him completely, we know—and God knows—that we fear Him. And that is the beginning of wisdom.\nIf you start thinking of things you’ve done wrong, don’t fall back into the trap of legalism. Instead, fall forward into grace and quote Psalm 130:4:\nBut there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. It is His grace and goodness that leads to repentance. And in that repentance, we gain more reverence and appreciation of Him.\nWhat does God require of us?\n“To fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments” (Deuteronomy 10:12-13) And we have that ability because the Holy Spirit gives us the gift of the fear of God, filling us with His wisdom and understanding. God bless you.\n~\nScripture is quoted from the Holy Bible, New King James Version, copyright © 1982 by Thomas Nelson. Used by permission. All rights reserved.\nShare This Devotional",

Virgos are amazing friends, always there to lend a hand and also lend advice. Virgo has a rich inner life, and can sometimes seem shy at first meeting. Your horoscope serves as a map for mastering the art of organization and self-improvement.\nHere is what is in store for you today:\nFor those born under the Virgo sign, the day ahead appears to be reasonably balanced. Individuals engaged in employment may find a boost in self-confidence due to the successful implementation of a past project at the office. It's crucial for these employees to remain vigilant and attentive to their tasks to achieve further success. In fact, superiors may recognise and reward this dedication by considering promotions. On the business front, Virgo entrepreneurs should tread with caution. Ensuring all legal documentation is in order is paramount, as overlooking these details could lead to unforeseen complications, including potential legal repercussions. It's advisable not to make significant financial investments in new ventures today.\nFor the younger Virgo individuals, steering clear of excessive indulgence in alcohol and cigarettes is essential, as these habits can detrimentally impact their lives. They should prioritise the needs of their parents, paying special attention to their well-being. Strengthening familial bonds and fostering happiness within the family can be a rewarding endeavour. Health-wise, some Virgos might experience discomforts like abdominal or back pain. Overburdening oneself isn't recommended.
