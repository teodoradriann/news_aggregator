    "text": "Alok Industries witnesses 20% surge as RIL invests Rs 3,300 Crore through preferential shares. {Photo: Facebook}\nOn January 2, the shares of Alok Industries experienced a remarkable surge, climbing 20 percent and hitting its upper circuit at Rs 25.80. This peak marked the stock’s highest level in the past 52 weeks. The rally was ignited by a significant investment move from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which subscribed to non-convertible redeemable preferential shares amounting to Rs 3,300 crore.\nThe preferential shares were issued to RIL at an attractive dividend rate of 9% through a private placement basis. Notably, these preferential shares hold the feature of being redeemable at par anytime within a maximum period of 20 years from the date of allotment.\nAlso Read\nOil jumps 1.5% in New Year after U.S. forces repel Houthis in Red Sea This investment announcement led to a surge in trading activity, with an impressive 11 crore shares changing hands on the exchanges. This volume is notably higher than the one-month daily traded average of 4 crore shares, underscoring the heightened investor interest in Alok Industries. Over the past month, the stock has also recorded a substantial 31 percent increase.\nReliance Industries, being a promoter in the textile manufacturing company, has a history of strategic involvement with Alok Industries. In 2020, RIL, in collaboration with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co, successfully acquired Alok Industries through bankruptcy proceedings. This acquisition was executed to recover the outstanding dues to creditors, solidifying RIL’s position in the textile sector.\nAlso Read SBI, ONGC, Sunteck Realty, Coal India Dalmia Bharat top picks for Motilal Oswal in 2024\nAs of the end of the September quarter, RIL held a substantial 40.01 percent stake in Alok Industries, while JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co owned a noteworthy 34.99 percent stake. This recent move by Reliance Industries not only highlights its ongoing commitment to Alok Industries but also positions the textile company for potential growth and strategic developments in the coming years.\nInvestors and industry observers are keenly watching how this infusion of funds and strategic support from Reliance Industries will impact the future trajectory of Alok Industries, as both entities continue to collaborate and navigate the dynamics of the textile sector.",

    "title": "Letter: Has the LDS Church divested itself from an investment linked to the ‘Hamas money machine’?",
    "text": "A recent New York Times there article — titled “Israel found the Hamas money machine years ago. Nobody turned it off.” — depicts how Hamas was funded generally and then how the money was used to finance its operations. The article concentrates primarily on Turkey’s involvement, but also on many Western investments.\nOf particular local interest is the following report: “Foreign investors piled in [in a real estate development firm named Trend GYO, a company found to be at the center of the Hamas portfolio] . . . . In 2019 while Washington sat on the ledgers, American and European banks held more than 3 percent of the company’s publicly traded shares on behalf of clients, Turkish financial records show.”\nThe LDS church was one of those investors: “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’s Investment arm Ensign Peak Advisors, bought more than 200,000 shares.”\nThe Times does provide an excuse for the investment: “There is no indication that the church . . . knew about any Hamas ties at the time. A church spokesman said that a U.S.-based investment adviser, Acadian Asset, bought the shares on its behalf.”\nNevertheless, Israeli authorities have now concluded that this influx of money not only helped Hamas prepare for the Oct. 7 attacks, but also gave leaders confidence that they would have the money to rebuild afterward. This opinion was voiced by five Israeli security officials.\nIt is of particular interest to know who is the church spokesman, and if the LDS Church, while apparently having no knowledge of Hamas ties, has divested itself of this investment, and if so when, and if not, why not.\nGene Fitzgerald, Salt Lake City\nSubmit a letter to the editor",
