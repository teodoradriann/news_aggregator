    "text": "Las negociaciones para alcanzar un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza avanzan positivamente y se acercan a un principio de acuerdo, si bien las partes todavía no han cerrado ningún pacto definitivo, informaron este sábado a EFE fuentes conocedoras de las conversaciones que tienen lugar en El Cairo. (Vea: La OMS pidió a países no bloquear el tratado global para combatir pandemias) Una fuente palestina dijo a EFE, bajo condición de anonimato, que \"hay un gran avance en las negociaciones entre el movimiento palestino Hamás e Israel\", y detalló que la delegación egipcia en el proceso negociador \"ha alcanzado una formulación acordada en cuanto a los puntos de discrepancia\".\nPrecisó que el último acuerdo sobre el que discuten actualmente incluye una primera fase de 40 días de tregua en la que se liberarán 33 rehenes del total de unos 128 rehenes israelíes retenidos por Hamás , mientras que el Ejército israelí se retirará de las zonas en las que esté presente en la Franja de Gaza.\nSegún esta misma fuente, la segunda fase continuará por otro periodo de 42 días durante el cual se liberarán todos los rehenes restantes y se extenderá un proceso de \"calma permanente en Gaza\", mientras que la tercera y la última fase incluirá intercambiar los cadáveres y durará también 42 días. (Siga leyendo: Brasil rechaza la oferta de Vale y BHP por el mortal colapso de una presa en 2015) También apuntó que \"(Sinwar) quiere un compromiso estadounidense por escrito para el fin incondicional de los combates\" y solicita también que Israel no impida regresar al territorio ocupado de Cisjordania a los palestinos liberados a cambio de los rehenes.\nSegún un alto funcionario de Hamás citado por la cadena catarí Al Yazira , el hecho de que Netanyahu insista en que Israel entrará en la ciudad de Rafah con independencia de un posible acuerdo es un \"elemento clave\" que también se está discutiendo hoy en las conversaciones.\nHasta el momento, en el enclave palestino, al menos 32 personas fallecieron en las últimas 24 horas, lo que elevó a 34.654 el número de víctimas mortales registradas en los hospitales del enclave, además de más de 77.900 heridos, según datos del Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí, dependiente de Hamás.

CARTER | Culture | CONTACT\nLocal underachiever Chris Crossley (20) has decided it’s time to get completely wankered at a party where he knows almost nobody.\nThe second-year student at Betoota Institute of Technology was a last minute invite to Jack’s 21st birthday party — a bloke he had never met before tonight.\n“Yeah I just said bring whoever,” Jack said, arms full of two slabs of the cheapest beer money can buy.\n“Should be a big one haha.”\nChris’ mate Toby took that literally, inviting Chris on a whim once he realised he had no plans.\n“I feel kinda bad for him to be honest,” Toby told our reporters.\n“So I thought I’d throw him some bait.”\nThose plans were turned upside down, however, when Toby disappeared with a potential suitor for 25 minutes.\nThe development then left Chris with little choice.\n“I mean it’s free drinks so,” he laughed as he cracked another can of social lubricant.\n“Haven’t had a big one in a while.”\n“Could get fuck-eyed actually.”\nChris was last seen bumping into strangers on the dance floor while singing ABBA at the top of his lungs.\nMore to come.\nWendell Hussey LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

    "text": "Allerta meteo per l’Italia settentrionale, ed in particolare, nuovamente, per il Nord/Est. In considerazione della situazione, il servizio PRETEMP (gruppo di lavoro che si pone l’obiettivo di studiare e prevedere i fenomeni temporaleschi severi sul territorio italiano) ha previsto un’allerta livello 2 che comprende principalmente il Veneto e in parte Lombardia, Trentino, Emilia-Romagna e Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Un’area contrassegnata da livello 1 circonda l’area di livello 2 (mappa di seguito).\nAllerta Meteo, i dettagli In dettaglio, il bollettino PRETEMP riporta: “ Un’onda corta più decisa rispetto a quella transitata nella giornata precedente causerà un’instabilizzazione atmosferica nel pomeriggio-sera prima sulle Alpi Orientali e Appennino Settentrionale e poi anche sulle pianure del Nord-Est. Un’afflusso di aria più fresca anche nei bassi strati da Nord favorirà l’innesco della convezione sulle pianure “.\nSono attesi “ temporali localmente forti già sulle fascia alpina e appenninica, con qualche grandinata di piccole-medie dimensioni e forti rovesci. In seguito, è probabile lo sviluppo di qualche supercella e QLCS sulle pianure di Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto e Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Tuttavia, c’è da menzionare che alcuni modelli ad area limitata faticano a sviluppare celle organizzate in aperta pianura. Dunque, c’è dell’ incertezza sull’effettivo sviluppo di temporali forti sulle pianure di Veneto, Emilia-Romagna e Lombardia, anche se si ritiene più probabile lo scenario in cui questi si andranno a sviluppare e per questo si è deciso di emettere un livello 2 “.\nI temporali “ potranno essere associati a grandinate, forti raffiche di vento e intensi rovesci. Rispetto al giorno precedente si ritiene più alta la pericolosità per grandine di medio-grosse dimensioni e più bassa quella per estese raffiche di vento intense. La probabilità di tornado è bassa, ma non nulla lungo la convergenza con lo Scirocco tra Veneto e Romagna “.\nFocus sull’area livello 2 Su questo settore, prosegue il bollettino di allerta meteo PRETEMP, “ si avranno condizioni ambientali simili al giorno precedente, con elevato CAPE (>2000 J/kg) e moderato DLS (attorno a 15 m/s). Un blando richiamo di Scirocco genererà una linea di convergenza sul Veneto Centrale e sulla Romagna , dove sono attesi valori un po’ più alti di instabilità potenziale e wind shear, anche direzionale. La forzante in quota sarà leggermente più intensa rispetto al giorno precedente, motivo per cui si ritiene che i temporali si dovrebbero estendere con maggiore diffusione verso sud colpendo l’ Emilia-Romagna e la pianura lombarda, almeno centro-orientale. I temporali si svilupperanno nel pomeriggio sulle Alpi e Appennino Settentrionale, verso il tardo pomeriggio dovrebbero interessare la pianura veneto-friulana e lombarda, per poi estendersi in serata all’ Emilia-Romagna . La probabilità di supercelle è maggiore tra Veneto Centro-Occidentale, Emilia-Romagna e Lombardia Orientale. La probabilità di grandine grossa è un po’ più alta rispetto al giorno precedente per il mixing ratio leggermente più basso nel boundary layer, per l’aria leggermente più fredda in quota e per il flusso più intenso in alta troposfera. Non dovrebbero comunque verificarsi episodi con chicchi particolarmente grossi e/o grandinate violente estese. La probabilità di estese forti raffiche di vento convettive è ridotta, seppur episodi di downbursts sono possibili. Il pericolo di tornado è basso e presente più che altro lungo la linea di convergenza con lo Scirocco “.\nAllerta Meteo, focus sull’area livello 1 “ Sulle aree di pianura di Emilia-Romagna e Lombardia a livello 1 valgono le considerazioni fatte per il livello 2, ma la probabilità di temporali è più bassa, ” si legge nel bollettino di allerta meteo PRETEMP. “ Sul Friuli-Venezia Giulia sono probabili dei temporali, ma solo localmente forti. La lingua di instabilità potenziale dall’Adriatico potrebbe estendersi più che altro verso il Veneto, dove di conseguenza è maggiore la probabilità di temporali forti. Qualche grandinata anche di medie dimensioni e forte raffiche di vento è comunque possibile. Sulle Alpi sono probabili dei temporali, solo localmente forti, specie nelle zone più prossime alle pianure. Sono possibili delle grandinate di piccole-medie dimensioni e forti rovesci “.\nDi seguito i link per l’accesso diretto alle pagine con le previsioni, particolarmente accurate nei dettagli, per le aree geografiche d’Italia (link sempre raggiungibili anche dal Menù in alto in tutte le pagine del sito):\nNord Italia Centro Italia Sud e Isole Le Previsioni Meteo Regione per Regione: Lombardia Lazio Campania Veneto Sicilia Emilia Romagna Piemonte Puglia Toscana Calabria Sardegna Liguria Marche Abruzzo Friuli Venezia Giulia Trentino Alto Adige Umbria Basilicata Molise Valle d’Aosta Per monitorare nel modo migliore possibile la situazione meteo in tempo reale, di seguito forniamo un elenco delle pagine con tutte le informazioni utili per seguire il nowcasting meteorologico minuto per minuto:\nSatelliti Satelliti Animati Situazione Fulminazioni Radar",

    "title": "Luciano Marín Arango, alias ‘Iván Márquez’",
    "text": "Luciano Marín Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” is a former guerrilla commander who rejected a 2016 peace agreement and formed a dissident group known as the Second Marquetalia (Segunda Marquetalia).\nMárquez, as the former second-in-command of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia’s (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC ), attracted many ex-guerrillas back to criminality in the wake of the peace accords, and received pledges of loyalty from certain ex-FARC mafia groups.\nAfter Colombian President Gustavo Petro launched his Total Peace (Paz Total) policy, which aims to negotiate with the country’s armed and criminal groups, Márquez and the Segunda Marquetalia have shown interest in negotiating with the government. However, the talks have not progressed beyond the initial stages.\nHistory Iván Márquez was born on June 6, 1955, in Florencia, the capital of Colombia’s southern Caquetá department. Like many of the FARC’s oldest members, Márquez was part of the Colombian Communist Party Youth Organization (Juventud Comunista Colombiana – JUCO), joining in 1977.\nAs a member of the JUCO, he supported the FARC in part by taking provisions to the group in the countryside. He joined the FARC in 1985 as a political commissioner for one of the rebels’ most active units, the 14th Front in Caquetá.\nIn the early 1980s, as part of a peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC, Márquez became a top emissary for the rebels’ nascent political party, the Patriotic Union (Union Patriótica – UP). He was later elected as a city council member and then as an alternate congressman for Caquetá.\nIn 1987, as the persecution of UP members by right-wing paramilitaries intensified, the FARC recalled Márquez and other top rebel emissaries in the party. The rebels named him commander of the Southwest Bloc for his efforts with the UP.\nIn the 1990s, Márquez was transferred to the northwestern part of the country, where he took part in a bloody battle for control of the Urabá region along the Colombia-Panama border.\nThis earned Márquez respect within the FARC as a strong military commander, complementing his political skills. The combination of these two abilities contributed to his trajectory as an international representative of the organization.\nHis activities and influence spread far and wide. He became the guerrillas’ top foreign emissary, and intelligence officials in Colombia said he headed efforts to infiltrate universities and create student federations to support the FARC’s political and military strategy in Colombian cities.\nThanks to his political and diplomatic skills, Márquez was chosen to head the FARC’s delegation for peace talks with the Colombian government in 2012. He continued to head the guerrillas’ negotiating team after the talks moved to Havana, Cuba in November of that year.\nAfter four years at the negotiating table, the FARC and the government signed peace accords in 2016. Márquez joined the body created to monitor implementation of the deal, and took a leadership position within the political party that replaced the rebel group.\nHowever, the peace process was beset by turmoil in April 2018 after US drug charges led to the arrest of FARC leader Seuxis Paucis Hernández Solarte, alias “ Jesús Santrich .” Márquez protested the arrest of his fellow former guerrilla and refused his post as a senator in the Colombian congress, which had been granted to him as part of the accords. He also ramped up his criticisms of the peace process and demanded that the government comply with stipulations in the agreement that had not been fulfilled, such as funding projects for ex-FARC members.\nAmid this uncertainty, Márquez moved to a reintegration camp headed by former FARC commander Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias “ El Paisa ,” who previously led the militant Teófilo Forero Mobile Column.\nSometime later, he fled from the camp along with El Paisa and went into hiding. He was not heard from until May 2019, when he sent a message via Twitter saying that the FARC guerrillas made a “grave error” when they put down their weapons.\nA few months later, in August 2019, Márquez — wearing fatigues and carrying a pistol — declared in a video published on YouTube that the Colombian government had “betrayed” the peace accords. He said his group, dubbed the Second Marquetalia in reference to the FARC’s original stronghold, would return to war.\nMárquez set up a base of operations in Venezuela, capitalizing on opportunities to get involved in drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and contraband. However, he faced significant setbacks in his attempts to gain control of the border region. At the end of 2021, three of his senior commanders were killed in Venezuela, leaving Márquez dangerously alone and exposed.\nIn December 2021, after the deaths of some of his closest allies, Márquez allegedly went into hiding. He was injured in an attack in 2022, and reports surfaced in 2023 that he had died from those injuries. But in 2024 he appeared in a video and later at a public event, confirming that he is still alive.\nCriminal Activities Iván Márquez has overseen the FARC’s drug policies, directing and controlling the production, manufacture, and distribution of cocaine. He also commanded FARC units accused of kidnapping, extortion and murder.\nAs the head of the Second Marquetalia, troops under his command control much of the drug trafficking along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, specifically in the Colombian department of Arauca and the Venezuelan state of Apure.\nGeography Before heading up the FARC’s peace negotiating team, Márquez primarily operated in northern Colombia. As commander of the Caribbean Bloc, his zones of influence included the Serranía del Perijá mountain range, the departments of La Guajira and Cesar, and some regions along the Colombia-Venezuela border.\nWhile groups associated with the Second Marquetalia operated elsewhere in Colombia, its base of operations since 2019 has been the Venezuelan state of Apure.\nAllies and Enemies Historically, the main enemies of FARC leaders like Márquez have included extreme right-wing elements of Colombia’s political elite, some of whom have had ties to paramilitary groups.\nHowever, the FARC has seen its share of infighting as well. A rift formed in its ruling body when Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri, alias “ Timochenko ,” assumed leadership of the FARC.\nThe division became most evident as the FARC transitioned into a political party. Márquez earned more votes than Timochenko to be elected to the party’s national directorate after running on a more critical line regarding the implementation of the peace agreement.\nFollowing his return to criminality and the creation of the Second Marquetalia, Márquez made numerous enemies. His troops frequently clashed with other ex-FARC mafia groups, like those commanded by Miguel Botache Santillana, alias “ Gentil Duarte ,” as well as the biggest remaining rebel group in Colombia, the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN ).\nThe Second Marquetalia also came under sustained pressure from Colombian and Venezuelan authorities, as three top commanders, El Paisa, Jesús Santrich, and Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “ Romaña ,” were all killed in Venezuela in 2021.\nProspects Following the deaths of most of the Second Marquetalia leadership, Márquez’s power and that of his group had significantly weakened ahead of Total Peace talks with the Gustavo Petro administration. The progress of peace negotiations with the Segunda Marquetalia has been impeded by the lack of clarity regarding the group’s status as a politically motivated insurgent group and their previous demobilization under the 2016 peace agreement with the FARC.",
