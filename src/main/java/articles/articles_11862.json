    "text": "If You Can Add 'That JD Vance Just F*cked' To The End Of A Campaign Statement, It's A Bad Campaign Statement\nI mean, unless you're the Harris campaign obviously.\nWe hate to show up at Mar-a-Lago and start slapping Donald Trump’s\nMario Kart dick out of everyone’s mouths — mostly because we’re worried it’d make some kind of comical Nintendo sound — but the advice in that headline is basic Campaign 101 kinda stuff. If you’re making a campaign statement, and you can add “that JD Vance just fucked” or “for JD Vance to fuck” or “the kind JD Vance likes to fuck? Don’t know, what did you hear?” to the end of a campaign statement, it’s a bad statement.\nWe are of course referring to the Trump campaign desperately trying to do … we don’t even know what … by ending one of its statements by comparing Kamala Harris’s relatability to that of a “worn-out couch.”\nThere is no way this was not intentional. There is no way those unfuckable losers didn’t think they were doing something funny and clever, something on the level of NO, JD VANCE DOESN’T FUCK COUCHES, YOU FUCK COUCHES!\nNO YOU FUCK COUCHES give us money, thanks.\nHere is the statement in question:\n“President Trump is an inspiring and gifted storyteller and referencing pop culture is one of many reasons why he can successfully connect with the audience and voters. Whereas, [Vice President Kamala Harris] is as relatable as a worn-out couch.”\nThe quote came from Steven Cheung, the incel-looking Trump campaign spox whose paycheck as far as we can tell is given in exchange for tasting Trump’s bathwater to make sure he farted in it. Oh, and issuing statements like these.\nThe article in question was in the Washington Post, attempting to answer why Donald Trump, a gross-looking man with clown makeup and apparent dementia, during every single rally\nstarts babbling about Hannibal Lecter.\nRecently, his intended meaning — and how fucking stupid Trump really is —\nsuddenly hit a bunch of people all at once. People realized Trump always tells starts fugue-stating about “the late great Hannibal Lecter” and “He’d love to have you for dinner” while ranting about immigration. About asylum-seekers, he said at the Republican Convention, “That’s insane asylums. They’re emptying out their insane asylums.”\nIt suddenly dawned on people that this halfwit imbecile thinks “asking for asylum” is the same kind of “asylum” as “insane asylum.” The Occam’s Razor with Trump is always the most obvious and also stupidest answer.\n“Ohhhhhhhhh!” it dawned on people. “He’s THAT dumb.”\nAnd as the Post explains, and as we’ve\nalluded to in the past, Trump’s brain, and his cultural references, and probably his wangledong, are preserved in amber in the 1980s. He never left that decade. That’s the last time any of his shit functioned. That’s the last time anybody who matters pretended they respected him with a straight face. (They never really respected him.)\nThat’s when he got his picture on Playboy and Time covers. That’s why he thinks New York is a crime-infested murder show, because in his brain, it’s the ‘80s outside.\nHe’s a cultural hermit who stopped meaningfully leaving the house in the ‘80s. It’s why he was once confused whether American veterans have cell phones. Those are for the “Miami Vice” guys! If it’s still 1988 in your mind.\nOr as Trump biographer Tim O’Brien puts it in the Post article:\nTrump is the “crypt keeper for the 1980s,” which was “the high point of his life until he became president,” said Tim O’Brien, a Trump biographer who has criticized the former president.\n“Every time he opens the door, people spill out from the 1980s, whether it’s Roger Stone or Rudy Giuliani, fashion from the ’80s spills out, whether it’s his monochrome tie or suits that invariably are made in two or three different colors … his office decor is still in the 1980s,” he said. “None of his tastes have been updated in decades.”\nAnd The Silence of the Lambs, book version, was side-by-side with The Art of the Deal in bookstores, and the movie came out in 1991.\nHis brain is dementia-stuck in one of those years.\nOr maybe we’re wrong, and as Steven Cheung said, it’s because Trump is an “inspiring and gifted storyteller” with a penchant for referencing pop culture, whereas Kamala Harris “is as relatable as a worn-out couch.”\n(That JD Vance recently grabbed by the cushy.)\nEvan has a new side project called\nThe Moral High Ground, you should check it out and subscribe there too!\nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter\nright here.\n@evanjosephhurst on Threads!\nIf you're shopping on Amazon anyway, this portal gives us a small commission.",

    "text": "(ZENIT Noticias / Ciudad del Vaticano, 07.01.2024).- En ocasión de la fiesta litúrgica del bautismo de Jesucristo que la Iglesia católica celebró el domingo 7 de enero, el Papa Francisco bautizó a 16 niños en la Capilla Sixtina de la Ciudad del Vaticano. Los padres de los niños estaban acompañados por los padrinos. Es tradición cada año que el Papa bautice a hijos de los empleados del Vaticano. Por esa razón la Capilla Sixtina, que forma parte del recorrido de los Museos Vaticanos, esté cerrada al público. La santa misa con bautismo inició a las 9:30 de la mañana. Tras la lectura del Evangelio el Papa dio una brevísima homilía en la que dijo: “estamos aquí para bautizar, para dar el don de la fe a nuestros hijos. Y ellos son los protagonistas de esta ceremonia: pueden hablar, ir, gritar… Ellos mandan, porque es su fiesta: van a recibir el don más hermoso, el don de la fe, el don del Señor. Si lloran -de momento callan, pero basta que uno dé la nota y empieza el concierto-, que lloren; si tienen hambre, dales de comer, tranquilamente, aquí. Si tienen calor, quítales la ropa, que a veces el calor hace daño. Ellos son los protagonistas, porque hoy nos darán también el testimonio de cómo se recibe la fe: con inocencia, con apertura de corazón. Y a vosotros, padres y padrinos, os deseo que vuestras vidas ayuden a estos niños, que les ayuden a crecer. Os deseo que les acompañéis en su crecimiento, porque ésta es una manera de ayudar, para que la fe crezca en ellos. Muchas gracias por vuestro testimonio, por traerlos aquí para que reciban la fe. Y ahora, continuemos con el rito del Bautismo. A continuación papás y padrinos fueron pasando con cada niño. El Papa Francisco estuvo acompañado por los cardenales Konrad Krajewski, limosnero papal, y Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, LC, presidente del Governatorato del Estado de la Ciudad del Vaticano. Antes de dar la bendición final el Papa dijo: “Antes de darles la bendición, les agradezco que hayan comenzado esta vida de sus hijos con el Bautismo. Y os encomiendo, que ellos conozcan la fecha del Bautismo, porque es la fecha del nacimiento. Y cada uno de nosotros también. Si os pregunto: «¿Cuál es la fecha de vuestro nacimiento?», no sé si todos lo sabrán. Pero pensad bien: la fecha de nacimiento es como un cumpleaños, la fecha en la que recibí la gracia del Señor y me hice cristiano. Enseñad esto a los niños, para que lo celebren cada año”.",

    "title": "Gates Foundation open access move ‘shifts needle in right direction’",
    "text": "The open access tool of author-paid publishing fees appears to be nearing an end point, with the Gates Foundation formally joining experts and publishers who see more problems than value in the once-promising alternative to subscription-based scientific journals. Gates, the largest US charitable foundation with a $75 billion (£60 billion) endowment and a particular focus on global health, said it has paid about $6 million since 2015 to cover the article-processing charges (APCs) for the researchers it funds. That is a costly practice, the foundation [has now concluded](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/research-paywall-open-access), and one that has been doing more to feed perceptions of certain journals as prestigious than to promote overall equity in scientific sharing. “We’ve become convinced that this money could be better spent elsewhere to accelerate progress for people,” Estee Torok, the foundation’s senior programme officer for malaria, said in outlining a shift that will require the results of Gates-funded research to be made freely available through online preprint formats rather than APCs. Author-paid fees won popularity in recent years as a chief solution to the longstanding problem of scientific journals with subscription charges being an obstacle to the wider sharing of government-funded research discoveries. The Gates Foundation, however, is now throwing its money and influence behind those who have increasingly warned of pitfalls, including the need for high APC rates to replace the revenues from subscriptions in the standard decades-old publishing models. “They’re one of the first funders to really aggressively act and say, ‘Nope, this is not working – we tried it as an experiment and it’s clearly too expensive,’” said Heather Joseph, executive director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, a leading advocate of open access in science. “Lots of other funders who have gone all-in on APCs are coming to the same conclusion.” cOAlition S, the Europe-based alliance of national research funding agencies that promotes open access research publications, was [similarly welcoming](https://www.coalition-s.org/the-bill-melinda-gates-foundations-open-access-policy-refresh/). The new Gates policy “builds on what has been learnt, responding to the increased recognition of the value of preprints in the research enterprise”, said the group’s executive director, Johan Rooryck, a visiting professor of linguistics at [Leiden University](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/leiden-university). In an earlier sign of trouble for APCs, the American Association for the Advancement of Science – the world’s largest multidisciplinary scientific society – conducted a survey of scientists in 2022 that showed researchers often lacking the funds to pay APCs, [with the problem especially acute](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-scientists-wary-author-publication-fees-under-biden-order) for female and younger scholars. Many universities and funders have talked of [reimbursing APC fees as part of grant awards](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/nature-and-university-california-expand-open-access-pact), but like Gates they appear to have underestimated the true cost. A leading alternative to subscription models and APCs – and the one now required by Gates for the scientists it funds – is the idea that researchers simply post a copy of their findings in online repositories that are freely accessible to anyone. That seems the best option, Ms Joseph said, even though it, too, has some shortcomings, including questions about the reliability of the funding for such repositories, and about the soundness of research ahead of its peer-reviewed and published version. In the long term, however, the preprint repository method could prove even more trustworthy than peer-reviewed journals and their months-long corrections processes, as the community of researchers gets into the habit of scrutinising papers posted online in their fields and flagging up possible mistakes, she said. A key unanswered question in the US involves the Biden administration. It has [set a 2025 deadline](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-orders-publicly-funded-research-be-made-free-access-immediately) for federal funding agencies to establish policies by which the results of the research they commission are immediately made fully and freely available to the public, and congressional Republicans recently failed in [a legislative bid to overturn that order](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/biden-open-access-order-under-threat-republican-budget-bill). For now – while awaiting the specific rules from the government’s individual funding agencies – the Biden approach allows, but does not require, the use of APCs as a pathway for agencies to reach compliance. Ms Joseph acknowledged that it was unclear what research reliability would actually look like under a system that relied on preprint repositories and trusted scientists to discover and report mistakes in research. But that approach seems better than any alternative, she said. “Is what Gates is doing solving the problem? No,” she conceded. “But it’s moving the needle in the right direction.” Register to continue Why register? - Registration is free and only takes a moment - Once registered, you can read 3 articles a month - Sign up for our newsletter [Register](/the-ums-modal/register/nojs) Subscribe Or subscribe for unlimited access to: - Unlimited access to news, views, insights & reviews - Digital editions - Digital access to THE’s university and college rankings analysis [Subscribe](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/store) Already registered or a current subscriber?

    "title": "Estate, torna iniziativa raccolta e riciclo lattine per bevande - Notizie - Ansa.it",
    "text": "Torna anche questa estate 'Nei Parchi Marini Calabria…ogni lattina vale', l'iniziativa green nata 4 anni fa grazie alla collaborazione tra Ente parchi marini regionali della Calabria (Epmr), Cial-Consorzio nazionale imballaggi alluminio e Coca-Cola.\n \"L'obiettivo è uno: recuperare - è detto in una nota - e avviare al riciclo il maggior numero possibile di lattine per bevande consumate fuori casa lungo le coste e nelle principali località turistiche/vacanziere della Calabria. Cento i lidi e le spiagge coinvolte in 28 comuni: Praia a Mare, Diamante, Scalea, Cutro, Amantea, Belmonte Calabro, Amendolara, Pizzo Calabro, Vibo Valentia, Briatico, Zambrone, Parghelia, Tropea, Brancaleone, Soverato, Bianco, Ferruzzano, Stalettì, Squillace, Cropani, Cetraro, Ricadi, Belvedere, Borgia, San Nicola Arcella, Bruzzano, Zeffirio, Palizzi. Dotati di appositi raccoglitori, nei mesi di luglio e di agosto tanti giovani animatori del progetto sono pronti a darsi da fare lungo le spiagge, per le strade e nelle piazze individuate per stimolare turisti e residenti a mantenere puliti gli spazi pubblici e recuperare le lattine per bevande vuote, promuovendo ad ampio raggio e in maniera coinvolgente le buone pratiche per un corretto smaltimento dei rifiuti\".\n \"Nelle passate edizioni i numeri - riporta la nota - sono stati davvero da record. Teniamolo bene a mente: l'alluminio è un materiale prezioso, riciclabile al 100% e all'infinito, essendo in grado di conservare in eterno le sue proprietà. Basti pensare che oltre il 75% dell'alluminio da sempre prodotto è tuttora in circolo. Un dato su tutti: il 100% della produzione nazionale di alluminio è basata e proviene dal riciclo\".\n \"L'Ente per i parchi marini regionali, ad oggi - afferma Raffaele Greco commissario Epmr - con l'aggiunta del Parco marino regionale 'Secca di Amendolara', interessa le aree costiere e marine calabresi più emblematiche e di pregio dal punto di vista naturalistico e biologico. L'educazione ambientale è un passaggio fondamentale per sensibilizzare e responsabilizzare i turisti e la popolazione che vive nelle aree limitrofe ai Parchi\".\n \"Anche quest'anno Cial - sostiene Stefano Stellini, direttore generale del Consorzio - torna sui lidi e sulle spiagge della Calabria promuovendo Every Can Counts - Ogni Lattina Vale.In tante località, lungo le meravigliose coste della Calabria tutti i turisti, i villeggianti e gli abitanti locali sono a non disperdere le lattine in alluminio per bevande consumate nei luoghi pubblici e a compiere un piccolo sforzo per far sì che siano raccolte in maniera adeguata e dunque avviate a un processo virtuoso di riciclo\".\n \"Dalla nascita di questo progetto, quattro anni fa - afferma Giangiacomo Pierini, Corporate Affairs & Sustainability Director di Coca-Cola Hbc Italia - collaboriamo con Ente Parchi Marini e Cial a questa importante iniziativa di economia circolare, che ci consente di contribuire concretamente al riciclo degli imballaggi in alluminio\".",

Se disputó a una temperatura de 19 grados celsius bajo cero y con sensación térmica de 30 bajo cero.\nEl juego con la temperatura más baja en la historia es el denominado como el ‘Ice Bowl’ que se jugó el 31 de diciembre de 1967 entre los Green Bay Packers y los Dallas Cowboys en el Lambeau Field, en Green Bay, Wisconsin, bajo una sensación térmica de 41 grados celsius por debajo de cero.\nEn el partido Patrick Mahomes, de Kansas City, terminó con 262 yardas y un envío de anotación. Con Miami Tua Tagovailoa, quien debutó en ‘playoffs’, pasó para 199 yardas y un ‘touchdown’; fue interceptado una vez y capturado en dos ocasiones.\nEn la serie inaugural del juego los Chiefs tomaron ventaja 7-0 con envío de Mahomes hacia Rice.\nEn el segundo cuarto Kansas City se alejó 10-0 con una patada de tres puntos, pero los Dolphins reaccionaron y rompieron el cero, 10-7, gracias a un envío de 53 yardas de Tagovailoa que encontró a Tyreek Hill, quien celebró su primer touchdown ante su ex equipo.\nLos monarcas respondieron con un par de goles de campo que los alejaron 16-7 antes del descanso.\nMahomes y los Swifties celebran tras cómoda victoria en playoffs\nEn una jugada cerca de la zona de anotación, Patrick Mahomes chocó casco contra casco con un defensivo, acción en la que el casco del ‘quarterback’ se rompió de la parte frontal. Mahomes tardó en acomodarse a uno nuevo, pero al final logró superar el incidente.\nEn el último periodo la defensiva de Miami al fin se dobló y Kansas City lo aprovechó para sentenciar el partido con un acarreo de Isiah Pacheco que dejó el juego 26-7.\nLa estrella del pop, Taylor Swift, estuvo en un palco en el estadio para apoyar a Travis Kelce, junto a la madre de éste y la esposa de Patrick Mahomes. Lució una gruesa chamarra de Chiefs con el número 87 que porta el ala cerrada que le diseñó la esposa de Kyle Juszczyk, corredor de poder de los San Francisco 49ers.\nEn plena victoria, se observaba el palco donde está ubicada la familia Mahomes, Taylor Swift y demás familiares celebrando al ritmo de la música y los fanáticos en una noche tormentosa difícil para los Miami Dolphins.\nSigue leyendo:\n–\n¿Quién es Jerod Mayo, el sucesor de Bill Belichick como entrenador de los New England Patriots?\n–\nTom Brady agradeció a Belichick por convertirlo en el jugador que fue, para muchos el mejor de la historia\n–\nAsesinan a un aficionado de los Buffalo Bills tras partido ante Miami Dolphins",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Max Verstappen, il rinomato pilota di Formula 1 della Red Bull, ha espresso un rinnovato ottimismo per la prossima stagione 2025. La sua fiducia deriva dai significativi miglioramenti apportati al veicolo Red Bull F1 di quest’anno, un netto contrasto con le difficoltà che il team ha affrontato lo scorso anno.\nVerstappen, che è riuscito a conquistare il suo quarto titolo mondiale nel 2024, non è estraneo a superare le sfide. Nella scorsa stagione, la Red Bull si è trovata a fare i conti con uno sviluppo inadeguato a metà stagione, portando a un deludente terzo posto dietro ai colossi McLaren e Ferrari nella classifica dei costruttori.\nNonostante questi ostacoli, la determinazione incrollabile e le abilità di Verstappen si sono messe in evidenza, assicurandogli il titolo mondiale. Questa resilienza è indicativa della filosofia di corsa dell’olandese, una testimonianza della sua affermazione che la prossima stagione “non può essere peggiore dell’anno scorso”.\nLa Red Bull F1 del 2025 è attesa come un elemento di cambiamento, riflettendo un significativo salto rispetto al suo predecessore. La convinzione di Verstappen nelle prestazioni del veicolo è un segno promettente per il team, suggerendo una stagione potenzialmente più forte in arrivo.\nNel mondo spietato delle corse di F1, dove i millisecondi possono determinare il vincitore, le prestazioni del veicolo sono fondamentali. Le difficoltà della Red Bull nella scorsa stagione hanno sottolineato l’importanza di uno sviluppo e di un’adattamento continui del veicolo. Quest’anno, sembrano pronti a correggere il loro corso, con Verstappen a guidare la carica.\nMentre l’anticipazione cresce a un crescendo per la prossima stagione di F1, la fiducia di Verstappen nel migliorato veicolo Red Bull F1 2025 è destinata a tenere i fan con il fiato sospeso. Resta da vedere se il suo ottimismo si tradurrà in una stagione vittoriosa o se sarà un altro anno di sfide impegnative per il team Red Bull. In ogni caso, la convinzione incrollabile di Verstappen nel potenziale della vettura 2025 è una testimonianza della sua resilienza duratura e del suo impegno per lo sport, qualità che hanno consolidato la sua posizione come uno dei piloti più rispettati della F1.",

Penumbra Inc, a leading developer and manufacturer of medical devices for the neurovascular and peripheral vascular markets, reported a notable increase in both revenue and net income, surpassing analyst estimates.\nCompany Overview\nPenumbra Inc specializes in creating innovative medical devices aimed at treating challenging conditions such as ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism. The company's products are primarily sold to hospitals and are designed for use by specialist physicians. Penumbra operates as a single reportable segment, focusing on the design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of its medical products.\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\nFor the first quarter of 2025, Penumbra Inc reported revenue of $324.1 million, a 16.3% increase from the same period in 2024. This figure exceeded the analyst estimate of $315.66 million. The company's net income rose to $39.2 million, translating to a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00. This is significantly higher than the estimated EPS of $0.70. This robust performance underscores Penumbra's successful expansion in the U.S. thrombectomy market, which saw a 25.0% revenue increase.\nKey Financial Achievements\nPenumbra's gross profit for the quarter was $215.9 million, representing 66.6% of total revenue, up from 65.0% in the previous year. This improvement was driven by a favorable product mix and enhanced productivity.

The company's ability to exceed revenue and earnings expectations positions it well for continued success in the competitive medical devices industry.
