    "title": "Liberia: Transparency and Accountability Group Extols Pres. Weah for Nominating Cllr. Dean to the Supreme Court Bench",
    "text": "MONROVIA — A group under the banner of the ‘Liberia Media Initiative for Transparency and Accountability’ (LIMITA) has commended President George Weah’s decision to nominate Cllr. Minister Frank Musa Dean as an Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Liberia. In a statement issued on Thursday, December 28, 2023, the Board of Directors of LIMITA described the recent nomination of Cllr. Frank Musah Dean as the best decision that would serve the interests of Liberia and the country’s jurisprudence. “As we are in the phase of transition, we believe that the learned Cllr. has all it takes to occupy such a post judging from his past and present performances. Cllr. Musah Dean Jr. over the past six years of the Weah-led administration has demonstrated competence, capability, and professionalism in discharging his duties as Minister of Justice of the Republic of Liberia. “Our findings have proven that the Minister has always stood his ground and has never wavered or succumbed to external influence in terms of ensuring that the right thing is done.” The statement also said, “Notably, Cllr. Musah Dean Jr., during his tenure as Justice Minister and Attorney General of the Republic of Liberia, was steadfast in making insightful impacts such as seeking extradition for alleged gun smugglers, being unbiased in the dispensation of justice, and issuing a non-restriction on the enjoyment of constitutional rights.” They also claimed that it was under the watch of Cllr. Frank Musa Dean Jr. that several mass protests and demonstrations were staged by major opposition blocs peacefully without any major casualties, incidents, or accidents, even if they did not seek permission from the Ministry of Justice. “With these references, LIMITA and its Board of Directors can safely assure the public that Cllr. Frank Musa Dean Jr. will discharge his duties without fear, intimidation, or external influence. “Therefore, we urge the Liberian Senate, the body that is responsible for confirmation, to kindly do the needful by confirming this noble and humble man so that he continues to contribute to the growth and development of Mama Liberia. We are of the strongest conviction that Cllr. Musah Dean Jr. is indeed the right choice to fill in that void.",

    "text": "Longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson will take over as head coach at Delaware State, Victory Formation Media and ESPN reported Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the latest data point in a growing trend of FCS football teams hiring well-known former players -- with little to no prior coaching experience -- in an effort to stand out. Jackson, 38, has no connection to Delaware State but according to ESPN, \"it has always been a dream\" of his to coach at an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities). Earlier this month, Norfolk State hired Michael Vick to take over the Spartans' program. Vick, who also reportedly heard from Sacramento State, hails from the Norfolk, Va., area. Norfolk State is one of Delaware State's rivals in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Colorado coach Deion Sanders spent three seasons (2020-22) as the head coach of Jackson State before moving up to the FBS level. His only prior coaching experience came at the high school level, including at his own short-lived charter school in Texas, \"Prime Prep Academy.\" Jackson last played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. He is best known for two stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2008-13, 2019-20) and played for a total of six teams in a 15-year NFL career. Jackson caught 641 passes for 11,263 yards and 58 touchdowns, adding four rushing touchdowns and four punt return touchdowns in 183 career games. Delaware State went 1-11 in 2024 (0-5 MEAC) and fired coach Lee Hull after the season. The Hornets have not had a winning season since going 6-5 in 2012. --Field Level Media\n Featured Local Savings Recommended for you Originally published on fieldlevelmedia.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "text": "Boston Dynamics' robot Atlas being billed as 'fully-electric humanoid': Watch it in action [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com/) is back at it again with its new humanoid robot. In a [post on X](https://x.com/BostonDynamics/status/1780603212359205323), formerly known as Twitter, the engineering and robotics design company debuted the robot named ['Atlas](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/)' in a 30 second video. Laying flat on the ground, Atlas begins to wake up. Bending its feet backwards, the humanoid stands up, twisting and turning as it makes its way to greet the cameraman. Although the robot does not have facial features, the few seconds of engagement with the cameraman can be counted as a brief conversation. Atlas then makes its way out of the frame. Joining [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) and [Stretch](https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/stretch), Atlas is a new fully-electric robot that Boston Dynamics said can tackle hard tasks. [Hyundai](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en) plans to invest in the engineering and robotics company to help with new testing for Atlas. The goal for humanoid is to be an improved version of the HD Atlas that will be able to lift heavier objects and improve various gripper technologies, according to the [Boston Dynamics blog post](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/?utm_campaign=cy24q2-atlas&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social).

This humanoid is famously known for its groovy dance moves that went viral in 2020. The purpose of a humanoid robot Creating a robot that has similar features to a human will help the robot navigate our world easier, Boston Dynamics explained. Although structurally Atlas looks exactly like a human, the goal of the robot is to move more efficiently to complete a certain task. After years of research and testing, the engineering and robotics company wants Atlas to be able to complete dangerous, dirty and dull tasks in real world scenarios.
