    "text": "The Nigeria Union of Teachers, Oyo State, has commended Governor Seyi Makinde-led government for recruiting 19,500 teachers in five years.\nThe union, in a statement signed by the NUT Chairman, Oladimeji Raji and the Secretary, Salami Olukayode, noted that the appointment of 5,000 teachers in his first term and 14,500 since the inception of his second term into the state primary and secondary schools was noteworthy.\nThe union said the ripple effects of the recruitment were that it would address the problems of inadequate manpower in the education sector and promote teaching and learning.\nThe statement read, “Your disposition towards turning the tide of the education system of Oyo State remains unprecedented and unmatched not only in the annals of recruitment history of our dear state in recent times but also across the entire 36 states of the Federation including the Federal Capital Territory.\n“Your Excellency Sir, your achievements in the education sector since assumption of office particularly, on the successful recruitment of over 14,000 qualified teaching professionals and about 3,500 non- teaching personnel, aside from an appreciative number of caregivers is a clear cut and a perfect reflection of your results-oriented style of leadership aimed at providing free, qualitative and quantitative education to the amiable citizens of Oyo State. This gesture shall, without doubt, have a significant touch in our classroom and as well enhance educational service delivery to our school children.”\nThe union said it was particularly glad that the teachers were recruited on merit.\n“It is no doubt that this noble achievement of yours, despite the prevailing global challenges of economic meltdown, will forever remain a variable tool and special reference point that may not be easily matched by successive administrations.\n“Indeed, you have successfully redeemed our position of honour in the comity of states, most especially on matters of education as envisioned by our beloved forebears. Hence, NUT appreciations of many folds.\n“Kindly be assured of NUT’s undiluted support and unaltered teachers’ dedication to work as expected.\nAhead of next week’s verification exercise of 5,600 newly recruited primary school teachers, the union appealed to the selected individuals to comport themselves to ease the process.",

    "text": "The NIH has morphed into a Marxist run organization that simply does not have the best interests of the American people at its core. In a joint effort, Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) are raising concerns about the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) plans to amend its mission statement by eliminating the commitment to “lengthen life.” The senators recently penned a letter to NIH Director Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, expressing apprehension over the potential repercussions of this proposed change. Not only is the NIH no longer insterested in extending life, but they have done all they can to actually shorten lives via their support of dubious papers designed to cover-up the facts on Covid. Natalie Winters explains ‘ The government is creating a “vaccine informatics system” to monitor discussions and “misinformation” about COVID-19 vaccines. They want to stop people from having the “reasoning behind refusing” flu, HPV and COVID vaccines. Read this NIH grant (see below) Why is the @NIH considering removing “lengthen life” from their mission statement? This could lead to an uptick in doctors recommending physician-assisted suicide- [Senator Marco Rubio] The NIH has worked with the FBI to cover up not only the origin of Covid but also the true effects of the vaccine on the American people, compared with simple treatments that could have saved about a million Americans. ‘We now know that the FBI was told very early in 2020 by a highly reliable informant that Covid leaked from the Wuhan lab. We also know the FBI established a task force by late March or early April 2020 and had “obtained proposals and progress reports for NIH grant AI110964 to EcoHealth (the grant that likely funded construction of SARS-CoV-2), and EcoHealth was their subject or target (h/t @R_H_Ebright)” All of which makes the information in the thread below even more alarming. It appears all but certain that the Intelligence Community was lying to the world. Did they lie to Trump as well? The April 2020 “Assessment” described below now makes even less sense. And remember, despite the IC’s claim, there was there was no scientific consensus at the time. But it gets worse. The IC’s August 2021 assessment (more than a year later) still claimed a natural origin. “Four Intelligence Agencies and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence that the initial infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with the virus or a closely-related virus.” Only the FBI dissented. Which would seem to indicate the higher levels of our IC, like the National Intelligence Council, knew everything and willfully downplayed the FBI’s information to perpetuate the lie. This seems like a big deal. We deserve some real answers. And some accountability, said [Jeff Carlson](https://x.com/themarketswork/status/1750150681099735179?s=20) Flash Forward to today… The lawmakers underscored their worries about the removal of the goal to lengthen life from the NIH’s mission statement, emphasizing the need for an explanation or justification. They expressed particular concern about the impact on public attitudes toward the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. The senators pointed to the increasing acceptance of physician-assisted suicide in some countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands, as well as certain states in the U.S., highlighting the potential consequences for those with disabilities. Highlighting the importance of treating individuals with disabilities with dignity and respect, the senators acknowledged existing stereotypes and biases in the research and healthcare sectors that hinder accessibility to timely care for people with disabilities. A bipartisan pair of senators wrote a letter expressing concerns with the National Institute of Health’s proposal to remove a vow to “lengthen life” from the agency’s mission statement. [https://t.co/cuMdPBRCpf] — The Hill (@thehill) [January 25, 2024] The senators’ letter was prompted by the NIH’s proposal in August of the preceding year to update its mission statement. The agency’s current mission statement emphasizes seeking fundamental knowledge about living systems, with a commitment to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The proposed change aims to rephrase the mission statement as follows: “To seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that knowledge to optimize health and prevent or reduce illness for all people.” The Advisory Committee to the Director, established in 2021, recommended this alteration to strengthen disability inclusion and eliminate language related to reducing disability from the NIH mission statement. The committee, in a report from December 2022, expressed concerns about the current mission statement perpetuating ableist beliefs and suggested that it could be interpreted as implying that disabled people need fixing. ‘Important interview by Rand Paul where he documents what he calls an “orchestrated” Wuhan lab-leak coverup and how Anthony Fauci and the CIA are obstructing Congress from investigating years of dual use and bio-weapon funding: “USAID, NIH, HHS, they’re withholding documents because they funded the lab in Wuhan, not just once, not just twice, but for a decade. “We have Anthony Fauci on record as saying that even if gain of function research infects a scientist and a pandemic occurs, that the knowledge would be worth the risk. “There’s a safety committee that was supposed to review this, and Anthony Fauci allowed this research to be done at his signature … without the approval of the safety committee. For this he really should go down in history perhaps as one of the worst people in public office ever and responsible for more deaths than any other individual in the medical world. “We also now know that [Fauci] was visiting the CIA in early 2020. We also know that the CIA scientists, seven of them, voted 6 to 1 to say it came from a lab and then they were reversed by superiors … he wasn’t recorded on visitor logs but he was appearing frequently at the CIA. “He was also in charge of a lot of bio-weapons money, and a lot of things that had dual use, and [the CIA] won’t reveal any of this to us. They had weekly meetings on dangerous dual use research concerns and gain of function, and not one item of any of those meetings has been released to us despite us asking for it for over three years.” said Charlie Kirk.

Sent a letter to the NIH Director with [@SenDuckworth]demanding an explanation. [https://t.co/xKGMEawFPe] — Senator Marco Rubio (@SenMarcoRubio) [January 24, 2024] While the NIH requested responses to the proposal by November 24, 2023, the change to the mission statement has not been finalized. The NIH has far more issues to deal with when it comes to basic honesty. The senators cited a 2022 survey indicating that over 80 percent of U.S. physicians believed that individuals with “significant disability” have a lower quality of life compared to those without disabilities. They raised concerns about the potential for discrimination in recommendations for physician-assisted suicide, given these prevailing views among healthcare professionals. Acknowledging the NIH’s efforts to address healthcare research disparities for people with disabilities, the senators expressed reservations about the proposal to remove “lengthen life” from the mission statement. They commended the NIH for recognizing the existing disparities but emphasized the need for clarity in the mission of the nation’s largest biomedical research funder. Senate duo questions NIH director over proposal to omit ‘lengthen life’ from mission statement [https://t.co/MZk2CC3tJf]via [@thehill] [pic.twitter.com/xFJjGMIFMb] — Charlie 🇺🇸 🍺 (@CharliesTapRoom) [January 25, 2024] To Sum it all Up: the senators requested the NIH to provide an explanation for considering the removal of “lengthen life” and to outline the potential impact on the agency’s research and grant-making priorities. Additionally, they sought details on the guidance that would be given to program officers and other relevant personnel if the proposed change were implemented, questioning whether external groups were consulted in the decision-making process. The senators’ concerns coincide with the ongoing national debate on physician-assisted death, with multiple states exploring legislation to legalize medically assisted death, and efforts to expand legalization persisting despite opposition from religious organizations. The NIH has slowly devolved into an anti-human organization that seems more willing to hide any information which conflicts with Leftist doctrines. They continue to support, with American tax dollars, labs all over the world including in Red China, that are hard at work to develop yet another disease that perhaps the NIH and WEF will roll out as their ‘Disease X’ in an effort to continue to destroy freedom on a global scale and bring about their Great Marxist Reset. As Lara Logan and many others have pointed out, Tony Fauci is a criminal who, through his direct actions, has contributed to the murder of approx. a million Americans who could have been treated with effective and safe drugs like Ivermectin.

    "text": "Segundo o relatório anual do ACNUR 'Tendências Globais em Deslocamento Forçado 2024', divulgado hoje, no final de 2024, o Sudão contava com 2,8 milhões de refugiados, um crescimento de 40% em relação a 2023, a esmagadora maioria (93%) nos vizinhos, sobretudo no Chade (1,1 milhões), Egito (602.700) e Sudão do Sul (487.700), e 11,6 milhões de deslocados internos, mais 2,5 milhões (28%) que no ano anterior.\nAs hostilidades em curso em todo o país desencadearam \"a maior crise mundial de deslocações, com um total de 14,3 milhões de sudaneses a permanecerem deslocados no final de 2024, quase todos dentro do país ou em países vizinhos\", o que representou mais 3,5 milhões do que no final de 2023, afetando cerca de um em cada três sudaneses, de acordo com a organização.\nTambém a situação na República Democrática do Congo (RDCongo), onde o conflito prolongado no leste do país tem sido caracterizado por contínuas violações graves e abusos dos direitos humanos contra a população civil, gerou \"uma das maiores, mas também das mais ignoradas, crises mundiais de deslocação interna\", salienta.\nNo final de 2024, 7,4 milhões de democrato-congoleses estavam deslocados à força, 8 em cada 10 dos quais permaneciam no seu país. Em 2025, o conflito agravou-se ainda mais: cerca de 140 mil pessoas tinham também fugido do país no início de maio de 2025, principalmente para os vizinhos Burundi e Uganda.\nJá o Sudão do Sul depara-se com o desafio de \"reabsorver os quase 750 mil refugiados sul-sudaneses que regressaram desde o início do conflito [no vizinho Sudão], em abril de 2023, 404.800 dos quais chegaram só em 2024\".\nNo que diz respeito à região do Sahel, o ACNUR aponta que as deslocações forçadas de e para o interior da região aumentaram para 3,8 milhões de pessoas devido à intensificação dos conflitos, mais 11% que no final de 2023 e um aumento de 58% desde o final de 2020 (quando eram 2,4 milhões).\nCerca de três quartos dos deslocamentos forçados na região do Sahel ocorreram dentro dos próprios países, com perto de 2,1 milhões deles no Burkina Faso, 412.000 no Níger e 361.000 no Mali, países cujos regimes resultam de golpes de Estado e enfrentam grupos 'jihadistas' e eventos climáticos extremos.\n\"Em 2024, o Sahel Central contabilizava mais de metade de todas as mortes relacionadas com terrorismo e perto um em cada cinco ataques em todo o mundo\", lê-se no relatório.\nA nível mundial, o número de pessoas forçadas a fugir de perseguições, conflitos, violência, violações dos direitos humanos e eventos que perturbam gravemente a ordem pública aumentou em 2024, atingindo o número recorde de 123,2 milhões, um aumento de 7 milhões de pessoas ou 6% em comparação com o final de 2023. Uma em cada 67 pessoas em todo o mundo foi deslocada à força no final de 2024.\n\"A procura da paz deve estar no centro de todos os esforços para encontrar soluções duradouras para os refugiados e outras pessoas forçadas a fugir das suas casas\", disse o comissário da ACNUR, Filippo Grandi.\nAté ao final de abril de 2025, o ACNUR estima que o total de deslocações forçadas a nível mundial tenha diminuído ligeiramente em 1%, para 122,1 milhões.\nNo entanto, a confirmação do decréscimo vai depender da dinâmica dos principais conflitos durante o restante do ano de 2025. A ONU espera, pelo menos, uma cessação dos combates, em particular, na RDCongo e no Sudão e que a situação no Sudão do Sul \"não se deteriore ainda mais\".\nO ACNUR salienta que 2024 registou o maior número de refugiados reinstalados em mais de 40 anos, com mais de 188.800 refugiados a poderem iniciar o processo de reconstrução das suas vidas em segurança num país terceiro.\n\"Os recursos para satisfazer as necessidades humanitárias urgentes, para apoiar os países de acolhimento, para proteger as pessoas dos riscos de movimentos perigosos e para ajudar os refugiados e outras pessoas deslocadas à força a encontrar soluções duradouras (...) são mais essenciais do que nunca\", lê-se no documento.\n\"As consequências da inação serão suportadas por aqueles que menos as podem suportar\", concluiu a ONU.\nLeia Também: Após ataque, exército do Sudão retira-se da fronteira com Egito e Líbia",

    "title": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash | Boise State Public Radio",
    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Ronaldo becomes 1st man to score 900 career goals Cristiano Ronaldo isn't showing any signs of slowing down. The 39-year-old recorded the 900th goal of his professional career Thursday, scoring against Croatia in Portugal's opening game of the 2024-25 Nations League. Ronaldo reached the milestone by scoring from close range in the first half of Portugal's eventual 2-1 win. Ronaldo appeared emotional after scoring, briefly celebrating and then putting his hands over his face and falling to the ground before being surrounded by teammates. The goal comes days after Ronaldo's inclusion in Portugal's squad raised eyebrows following his poor performance at Euro 2024. Asked about possibly retiring from the national team, Ronaldo [said](https://thescore.com/news/3066346) the thought \"never\" crossed his mind after the summer tournament. He now has 131 goals in 213 appearances for Portugal. His 769 club goals are split between Real Madrid (450), Manchester United (145), Juventus (101), current team Al-Nassr (68), and Sporting CP (5).
