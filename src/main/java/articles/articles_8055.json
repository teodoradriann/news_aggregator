    "title": "She Was A Brave Warrior And Ruled The Celtic Iceni Tribe, Gathering A Rebel Army Of Over 100,000 People To Take Revenge On The Romans After They Stormed Her Late Husband’s Land",
    "text": "Powerful, fierce women have been around for centuries, but their stories often get overshadowed by prominent men from their time periods. For instance, do you know who Queen Boudica, the Iceni tribe ruler and brave warrior, was? Researchers believe Boudica was born around 25-30 CE, but much of her life before the Roman conquest is unknown. She was born into a noble family in England and eventually married Prasutagus, king of the Celtic Iceni tribe. After marrying him, she became the tribe’s queen, and they ruled side-by-side. They also had two daughters together. When Prasutagus died around 60 CE, he divided his kingdom in half, giving one to the Roman Emperor Nero and the other to his daughters. However, the Romans were not pleased with this plan and stormed Prasutagus’ land, wanting to take it for themselves. During the Romans’ plight, they seized property and items from the Iceni and made a mockery of Boudica by publicly flogging her and taking advantage of her daughters. Furious by the actions of the Romans, Boudica swore to take revenge and began plotting what is known as Boudica’s Revolt.

    "text": "Xcel Energy improving Harrington Generating Station’s fuel transformation with new gas pipeline investment AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - Xcel Energy’s 2020-initiated project to convert a coal-fueled station to natural gas is gaining momentum with the acquisition of the new pipeline. The several mile long pipeline will be located near Lakeside Drive in Potter County. This move not only improves air quality for the county, but also positions Xcel for cost-efficient and environmental friendly operations. “Natural gas does not emit the same level of sulfur dioxide than a coal plant would,” said Wes Reeves, Xcel Energy senior media relations representative. Reeves said Xcel is hopeful to have the access they need and begin construction of the pipeline by the end of the first quarter. “So we’re in the process right now of finishing up the land access and land acquisition for that pipeline project that could be about a 20 mile pipeline,” said Reeves. The roughly $75 million project is set to be completed by January 2025. Copyright 2024 KFDA. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - AzerNews) Ulviyya Shahin Read more\nTo boost global climate action, Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan's Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources and President of the upcoming 29th UN Climate Change conference (COP29), has sent official communications to participating governments. This move, reported by various international outlets, including the UK's Business Green, signifies a renewed effort to secure tangible climate commitments.\nThe COP29 President has confirmed that a pivotal focus during the conference will be reaching a consensus on a new climate financing target. Emphasising the urgency, he urges governments to update their national climate plans to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Defining a fresh collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG) is set as a primary agenda item under Azerbaijan's presidency.\nThe letters also stress the necessity of agreeing on an ambitious and feasible climate finance target, especially tailored to the needs of developing countries within the Framework Convention.\nAccording to Babayev, achieving consensus on climate finance targets requires collaborative effort among nations. He underscores that this is not solely Azerbaijan's priority but a collective responsibility to achieve this significant milestone.\nFurthermore, Babayev details pre-summit events and meetings leading up to COP29 in Baku, involving ministers from UNFCCC member nations, negotiating groups, and NGOs.\nThe publication highlights the critical steps needed to ensure the operational effectiveness of the Loss and Damage Fund, initiated at COP28 in Dubai last year. This fund aims to aid vulnerable and developing nations in managing climate change impacts.\nThe COP29 President's correspondence coincided with a poignant video message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, who, following Hurricane Beryl's devastation of his home island of Carriacou, emphasised the human and economic toll of climate disasters. Stiell called for prioritising climate action to prevent such tragedies from becoming commonplace.\nBusiness Green, a reputable UK publication focusing on environmental issues and the green economy, reported these developments.\nMENAFN19072024000195011045ID1108458136",

    "text": "Risk for severe thunderstorms over North Florida, Panhandle on Thursday and Friday Several rounds of potentially dangerous thunderstorms are forecasted for parts of Florida’s Panhandle and North Florida on Thursday and Friday. According to specialists at the Storm Prediction Center in Normal Oklahoma, these storms could produce all modes of severe weather: Straight-line winds in excess of 60 mph, large hail, and tornadoes. On Thursday morning, mid-level energy was exiting the Ohio and Tennessee River valleys to the east, after producing numerous supercell thunderstorms and tornado reports over the region Wednesday night. Several clusters of thunderstorms were, on Thursday morning, tracking through parts of South Carolina, Georgia, and northeastern Alabama. These groups of storms will continue to be steered southeastward throughout the day, and they could intensify as they approach the Florida Panhandle and North Florida during the afternoon and evening. As of writing, the Storm Prediction Center has outlined the entire Panhandle and most of North Florida under a slight, or level 2 out of 5, risk for damaging thunderstorms on Thursday. This means that ingredients will be in place to support scattered occurrences of large hail and damaging wind gusts. In addition, isolated tornadoes will be possible. Storms should arrive to the Panhandle region during the mid to late afternoon, before pushing southward into the northern peninsula during the late afternoon Thursday into the evening. Storms are expected to weaken Thursday night as they push southeastward and eventually dissipate. Additional rounds of strong storms are expected to threaten the same regions Friday. The first round should approach the western Panhandle after midnight but before dawn. Then, this first cluster of cells should push toward Tallahassee during the morning commute before tracking east toward Cedar Key, Gainesville, Ocala, and in the Jacksonville metro area can expect storms to approach late Friday morning. Friday’s second round of thunderstorms is modeled to approach the western Panhandle during the mid-morning before quickly tracking eastward to the Tallahassee by the late morning and into North Florida during the early afternoon. Storms on Friday could also produce damaging wind gusts in excess of 60 mph, hail, and isolated tornadoes. The risk for these hazards, according to the Storm Prediction Center, is highest on Friday from Tallahassee to Jacksonville and southward toward Gainesville. Interests in these areas are urged to remain weather aware on Thursday and Friday, as the forecasted area of impact and timing of impact could change. If warnings are issued for your immediate area, take cover in the inner-most room of a sturdy building, away from windows. Copyright 2024 Storm Center",
