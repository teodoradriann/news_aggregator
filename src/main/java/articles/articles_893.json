    "text": "Citizen science, where the public collects and analyses scientific data, can contribute to monitoring and testing of water quality in South Africa, delegates at the third yearly IIE MSA Water Symposium heard recently.\nThe two-day event, themed ‘Citizen Science – Uniting Science and Society for Sustainable Solutions’, was hosted in Johannesburg by the IIE MSA’s Centre for Water and the Environment in partnership with the Ecological Engineering Institute of Africa.\n“What we really need to do is capacitate people so that they are able to overcome issues. So not only do we want to encourage people to be involved but we want to and need to capacitate them to take action and to be change agents. Citizen science provides us with a very powerful tool, to do just that,” IIE MSA environmental science head Linda Downsborough said at the symposium, where the importance of access and availability of safe and clean water was highlighted by various speakers.\nWhile taps periodically run dry in some parts of South Africa owing to water supply disruptions caused by droughts, population growth, rapid urbanisation and underinvestment in infrastructure, the quality of tap water, especially in larger metropolitan areas, is, for the most part, considered healthy and drinkable.\nHowever, the quality of water in rivers, streams and beaches has deteriorated owing to pollution, with WaterCAN executive manager Dr Ferrial Adam highlighting that more than 50 000 litres of sewage flows into the country’s rivers every second.\nUniversity of KwaZulu-Natal research associate Dr Jim Taylor , delivering a keynote address, also noted that owing to pollution, there is no river today that has safe water to drink when it enters the sea.\nThis pollution can have numerous consequences, the speakers warned, highlighting that South Africa has first-hand experience of the dangers of poor water quality after a cholera outbreak last year led to about 30 deaths in Hammanskraal in Pretoria.\nThe waterborne disease was caused by the failure of the Rooiwal wastewater treatment works, operated by the City of Tshwane, to meet the desirable final effluent quality for discharge to the Apies river.\n“The health hazards posed by unsafe water make it an imperative to test our water consistently. However, with an extensive river and stream network that extends about 160 000 km, ensuring effective monitoring systems are in place is difficult.”\nThis is where citizen science can come in, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund’s Dr Khumbuzile Zuma highlighted during a keynote address.\n“Citizen science tools are simple, practical and scientifically proven and knowledge is generated from the ground up.”\nTaylor also highlighted South Africa’s role in the citizen science movement, especially in regard to meeting the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially that of SDG 6.\n“South Africa has taken the lead in developing water quality monitoring tools like Clarity Tube and MiniSASS, which are inexpensive and easy to use. In fact the United Nations report on progress on ambient water quality highlighted miniSASS as having global potential,” he explained, adding that these tools were instrumental in bringing about change in Mphophomeni township near Midmar dam, in KwaZulu-Natal.\nCommunities recognise the importance of working with professional scientists and researchers to monitor and test water quality.\nIn 2022, WaterCAN worked with 77 community volunteers who conducted 100 tests. This number grew more than ten-fold with the number of volunteers increasing to 866 in 2023, resulting in 1 500 tests being carried out.\nThe South African National Biodiversity Institute (Sanbi) in partnership with Nature Speaks and Responds NPC, is also currently working with traditional health practitioners on citizen science aquatic monitoring and a Water Research Commission-funded Citizen Science State of the Rivers Reporting project is also underway.\nOwing to the deterioration of water quality, organisations such as WaterCAN and many others are being galvanised into action to collaborate with communities to monitor and test the quality of water across the country.\nThe Citizen Science Association of Southern Africa is being developed, and is cochaired by Sanbi’s Dr Pearl Gola and the Department of Water and Sanitation’s Noloyiso Mbiza .\n“There really seem to be a lot of things going on in the citizen science space, both locally, nationally and globally, and the interest in the IIE MSA Water Symposium is a signal of this – and one of the things we really wanted to do was to provide a platform to bring people together to talk about citizen science,” said Downsborough.\nThe Centre for Water and the Environment at IIE MSA also partnered with ADvTECH’s Environmental Social Governance unit and ran a competition for primary and high school students around the country and Africa.\n“We were taken aback by the calibre of entries we received. It highlighted just how important citizen science is,” she said.\n“We need to democratise science and bring water and the environment into our classrooms.”\nEdited by Creamer Media Reporter",

Back when a small group of developers at Interplay Productions released\nFallout in 1997, I’m sure they couldn’t imagine they were setting the foundations for one of the most iconic RPG series of all time. From its humble beginnings as an isometric CRPG to Bethesda’s first-person RPG take on the series, Fallout has gone through several genre and tonal shifts over the years. And with the first season of a brand-new Prime Video TV show coming out, Amazon is set to bring the world of Fallout to our TV screens for the first time.\nThis makes it the perfect time to look back on the long-running series and find out exactly what it was about Fallout that set the RPG world on fire!\nFeaturing: Jonathan Logan, Abraham Kobylanski, Jimmy Turner; Edited by Jonathan Logan\nOpening and ending music by Miles Morkri\nListen and subscribe where you please, and leave a rating if you can!

    "text": "Cómo Hacer ¿Cómo usar agua tibia con vinagre para ahuyentar a las polillas? Este método simple y poderoso es una herramienta valiosa en la lucha contra las plagas. [Por: Redacción El País](/autor/redaccion-el-pais/) En el constante desafío de mantener nuestro hogar libre de plagas, las polillas a menudo se presentan como un problema persistente. Estos insectos nocturnos pueden causar estragos en la ropa, alimentos y otros objetos de valor. Sin embargo, en la búsqueda de soluciones efectivas, a menudo pasamos por alto métodos simples y naturales. Una alternativa poco convencional pero sorprendentemente eficaz: [ el uso de agua tibia con vinagre para ahuyentar a las polillas](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/como-limpiar-y-purificar-el-hogar-para-recibir-el-ano-nuevo-2847.html). Descubrir los fundamentos científicos detrás de esta técnica, cómo implementarla de manera efectiva podría ser la solución que estaba buscando. Es crucial comprender la base científica que respalda la efectividad del agua tibia con vinagre contra las polillas. Estas, en su mayoría, buscan ambientes cálidos y oscuros para reproducirse y anidar. Al introducir agua tibia en el escenario, se altera su hábitat preferido, creando un entorno menos acogedor para su supervivencia. Además, el vinagre, con sus propiedades ácidas, actúa como un potente agente repelente. [ Las polillas, al detectar el olor del vinagre, tienden a evitar el área tratada, disuadiéndolas de anidar o causar daños. ](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/la-fruta-que-ayuda-a-alejar-las-cucarachas-de-la-cocina-2824.html)Este enfoque natural no solo es respetuoso con el medio ambiente, sino que también evita la necesidad de recurrir a productos químicos agresivos que podrían ser perjudiciales para la salud humana y el medio ambiente. ¿Cómo preparar y aplicar la mezcla de agua tibia con vinagre? La clave para el éxito de esta técnica radica en la correcta preparación y aplicación de la mezcla de agua tibia con vinagre. Aquí hay un sencillo paso a paso para implementar este método de manera efectiva: - Ingredientes necesarios: agua tibia: calentar una cantidad suficiente de agua para abordar las áreas problemáticas. Vinagre: prefiere vinagre de manzana o vinagre blanco, ambos conocidos por sus propiedades repelentes. [Atomizador o esponja: facilitará la aplicación precisa de la solución.](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/asi-se-debe-purificar-el-hogar-para-ano-nuevo-segun-el-feng-shui-2857.html) - Proporciones adecuadas: mezclar partes iguales de agua tibia y vinagre. Una proporción de 1:1 suele ser efectiva, aunque puede ajustarla según la gravedad de la infestación. - Aplicación estratégica: verter la mezcla en un atomizador para una distribución uniforme o utilizar una esponja para aplicar directamente en áreas propensas a la infestación, como armarios, estantes y rincones oscuros. - Reaplicación periódica: la efectividad de la solución puede disminuir con el tiempo. Por lo tanto, [es recomendable reaplicar la mezcla cada cierto tiempo, especialmente si nota un aumento en la actividad de las polillas.](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/bromas-faciles-para-hacer-hoy-por-el-dia-de-los-inocentes-2818.html) *Este artículo fue creado con ayuda de una inteligencia artificial que utiliza machine learning para producir texto similar al humano, y curado por un periodista especializado de El País.",

    "title": "Manus AI and the Future of Generalized AI Agents: A Disruptive Long-Term Play",
    "text": "Manus AI and the Future of Generalized AI Agents: A Disruptive Long-Term Play\nThe rise of artificial intelligence has long been framed as a race to create smarter, faster, and more efficient tools. But in 2025, a paradigm shift is emerging: the rise of generalized AI agents—systems that not only generate information but autonomously execute complex, real-world tasks. At the forefront of this revolution is Manus AI, a Chinese startup's creation that is redefining the boundaries of what AI can achieve. Its \"Less Structure, More Intelligence\" approach is not just a technological innovation but a strategic reimagining of how humans and machines collaborate. For investors, this represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector poised to reshape global productivity and economic value.\nThe \"Less Structure, More Intelligence\" Revolution\nTraditional AI tools—chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini—require users to break tasks into rigid, step-by-step instructions. Manus AI, by contrast, operates as a digital collaborator that thrives on ambiguity. Users provide high-level goals (e.g., \"Create a market analysis report for a SaaS startup\"), and Manus autonomously researches, synthesizes data, generates charts, and delivers polished outputs. This \"less structure\" model mirrors human problem-solving, where creativity and intuition replace rigid workflows.\nThe technical underpinnings of this approach are equally compelling. Manus employs a multi-agent architecture—Planner, Execution, and Verification agents—that work in tandem to decompose tasks, allocate computational resources via a credit-based system, and adapt to unforeseen challenges. For instance, if a user asks to \"Automate a B2B lead generation pipeline,\" Manus might independently deploy tools for web scraping, CRM integration, and A/B testing of outreach strategies. This level of autonomy is a stark departure from the \"tool-based\" AI assistants of today.\nMarket Validation: Performance and Demand\nManus AI's technical prowess is matched by its market traction. In early 2025, its private beta generated 1 million requests in a single week, a testament to its appeal across industries. On the GAIA benchmark, a rigorous test of real-world task-solving, Manus reportedly outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 and achieved a score exceeding 65%—a benchmark previously held by H2O.ai's h2oGPTe. This performance has drawn comparisons to OpenAI's Operator, but with a critical edge: Manus operates across multiple domains (e.g., legal research, marketing, SaaS), while Operator is focused on consumer-facing tasks like online bookings.\nThe financial markets have taken notice. AI ETFs surged by billions in early 2025 as investors bet on the \"AI agent\" narrative, with Manus AI cited as a key catalyst. Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu—China's tech giants—have all seen stock price increases, reflecting broader optimism about AI-driven value creation. For institutional investors, Manus AI represents a \"picks and shovels\" opportunity: it is a foundational tool in the AI ecosystem, much like cloud computing platforms were in the 2010s.\nCompetitive Advantages and Long-Term Potential\nManus AI's differentiation lies in three key areas:\n1. Autonomous Execution: Unlike chatbots, it delivers tangible outcomes (e.g., code, reports, workflows) without requiring human intervention.\n2. Cross-Industry Adaptability: From healthcare diagnostics to algorithmic trading, Manus's tools are designed for scalability.\n3. Cost Efficiency: At $2 per task, it is a tenth the price of OpenAI's DeepResearch, making it accessible to small businesses and startups.\nThese advantages position Manus to disrupt not just specific tools (e.g., SEO software, legal research platforms) but entire industries. For example, a single Manus AI instance can replace a team of analysts in financial data processing, reducing costs and accelerating decision-making. In education, it could democratize access to personalized learning content by automating curriculum design.\nRisks and Realities\nNo investment is without risk. Manus AI is in a beta phase, with limited access and occasional instability (e.g., errors in handling paywalled content). Its closed-source model also raises questions about transparency and long-term governance. However, these challenges are not unique to Manus; they are part of the broader maturation curve for AI agents. The company's plan to open-source key models in 2025 could mitigate these concerns while fostering ecosystem growth.\nInvestment Thesis\nFor long-term investors, Manus AI embodies the next phase of AI evolution: autonomous, intelligent systems that drive productivity gains and economic growth. Its \"Less Structure, More Intelligence\" approach aligns with the natural progression of AI from narrow, task-specific tools to generalized agents. As AI agents become the new \"operating system\" for business and daily life, Manus's first-mover advantage and technical superiority give it a strong chance to dominate the market.\nActionable Advice:\n- Venture-Stage Investors: Consider early-stage exposure through Monica.im's equity or AI-focused venture funds.\n- Institutional Investors: Allocate to AI ETFs and Chinese tech stocks (e.g., Alibaba, Tencent) that are positioned to benefit from the AI agent ecosystem.\n- Conservative Investors: Monitor the open-sourcing of Manus's models in 2025 for signs of broader adoption and ecosystem growth.\nThe future of AI is no longer about answering questions—it's about solving problems. Manus AI is leading the charge, and for those who recognize its potential early, the rewards could be transformative.\nComments\nNo comments yet",

    "text": "By Jeremy Hanna ,\n31 minutes ago\nDespite having a Hall of Fame-worthy career, a Green Bay Packers legend has plummeted in a recent ranking of the best players in the National Football League.\nAaron Rodgers is arguably the greatest Packers quarterback of all time and one of the best in the history of the NFL. However, this didn't stop him from leaving Green Bay and heading to the New York Jets.\nUnfortunately, his debut season with the new team ended after he was injured in the first game. This has caused his ranking in NFL.com's list of the Top 100 Players of 2024 to drop severely from last year.\n\"Rodgers took a major descent in this year’s rankings after a torn Achilles limited his debut season with the Jets to just four snaps,\" Krissy Hetherington said. \"But the future Hall of Famer remains one of the most decorated quarterbacks in the league with four MVPs, 10 Pro Bowl honors and four All-Pro nods in addition to his one Super Bowl title.\"\nThis marks the second year in a row that Rodgers faced a significant drop in these rankings. Ranked third overall in 2022, Rodgers' final season with the Packers wasn't quite up to his MVP standards, causing him to drop 48 places to 51st overall in 2023.\nThis particularly stings because the ranking isn't decided by analysts or experts, but by fellow NFL players . On the bright side, Rodgers didn't have the largest fall from grace. That \"honor\" belongs to free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who dropped 61 places.\nRodgers hasn't gotten the chance to prove himself in New York. 2024 will be the perfect time for him to show that he still has plenty left in the tank after almost 20 years in the NFL.\nMore NFL: Green Bay Packers fans will love USA Today's prediction for 2024 season\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Sumar y Podemos denuncian la guerra en Palestina y Montero reta a Ribera a que lo llame \"genocidio\"",
    "text": "MADRID, 6 (EUROPA PRESS) Sumar y Podemos han aprovechado el debate electoral de RTVE para las elecciones europeas para referirse al conflicto en Palestina y denunciar lo que consideran un \"genocidio\" por parte de Israel, y la candidata de los 'morados', ha retado a la socialista Teresa Ribera a que \"reconozca\" ese genocidio, pero la vicepresidenta ha declinado el envite.\nAsimismo, Montero ha recriminado a Ribera que el Gobierno esta mañana haya anunciado que se suma a la demanda presentada por Sudáfrica ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) contra Israel por presunta violación de la Convención contra el Genocidio y que, \"esa alegría\" que ha sentido \"mucha gente\" se haya transformado en \"dos minutos exactos\" en \"rabia y desesperación\" en la rueda de prensa del ministro de Exteriores, José Manuel Albares, que a su juicio ha dicho \"cosas inaceptables\" como que \"España no toma partido\". \"Dice se mantiene neutral entre un Estado \"genocida y un pueblo masacrado\", ha lamentado.\nSE ESTÁN ROMPIENDO LOS CONSENSOS EN LA UE A su juicio, las decisiones que está tomando Europa sobre la guerra \"sí están rompiendo los principales consensos europeos que tienen que ver con la paz, con el antifascismo y con el bienestar de los pueblos\", ha manifestado, preguntándose al mismo tiempo que \"si Europa no es capaz de construir paz y sobre todo de acabar con el genocidio en Palestina ¿para qué sirve Europa?\".\nAl hilo, Montero ha apelado de nuevo a Ribera preguntándole de forma directa que si España no va a la CIJ para acusar al genocida Netanyahu de genocidio, \"¿para qué narices va?. ¿Qué ata al Gobierno con el estado genocida de Israel para no romper relaciones diplomáticas y comerciales cuando por mucho menos las hemos roto con Argentina?\", ha insistido.\nHa sido en este punto cuando la candidata de la formación morada ha interpelado a Ribera para que reconozca que lo que está haciendo Israel a Palestina es \"un genocidio\", algo a lo que Ribera ha declinado responder de forma directa si bien ha sostenido que el \"asunto del genocidio\" está en el debate y que por eso España se ha sumado a Sudáfrica. \"Estamos en el lado correcto de la historia\", se ha limitado a decir.\nDe su lado, la candidata de Sumar, Estrella Galán, ha arrancado su intervención pidiendo a las fuerzas políticas presentes en el debate de RTVE que hagan una condena firme y determinante por el \"genocidio\" que está ocurriendo en Palestina, recordando el bombardeo que esta mañana Israel ha ejecutado en una escuela de la UNRWA en Gaza y que ha dejado al menos 40 muertos.\n¿Y UCRANIA? En torno a este asunto el candidato de Ciudadanos, Jordi Cañas, ha defendido que las elecciones europeas no van de \"Sánchez o de Feijóo\" ni tampoco de Israel o Hamás porque, según ha dicho, los ciudadanos \"tienen otros problemas que asumir\" que son \"los reales\", unas palabras que ha reprochado Montero.\nDicho esto, Cañas ha respondido a la candidata de Podemos que cuando \"habla de paz y de guerra nunca dice que la guerra la provoca Putin, una cosa muy extraña\", ha deslizado, a la par que ha defendido que la economía de la defensa pasa por fabricar fragatas en Ferrol y en Cádiz, hacer submarinos en Cartagena al igual que helicópteros en Getafe, aviones en Sevilla o munición en Palencia.\n\"Y a ti todo eso te da igual, porque ese empleo a ti te da lo mismo, y ese empleo es clave para garantizar nuestra seguridad, frente a quien ha provocado la guerra, frente quien ha provocado el incremento de los precios del gas, frente a aquel que ha invadido un país que nunca lo citas. Es como si no pasara, como mágico\", le ha lanzado, provocando la reacción de Montero que ha asegurado que Putin \"es un criminal\".\nLeer más acerca de: Israel Podemos Palestina Teresa Ribera Sumar RTVE",
