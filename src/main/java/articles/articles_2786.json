    "text": "Bill to ban Satanic displays ultimately blocked by Arizona lawmakers A bill that would have forbidden representations of Satan on public property failed in the state Senate on Thursday when two Republicans opposed it alongside all the chamber’s Democrats. The vote followed an incident two weeks ago, when Democratic Sen. Juan Mendez (D-Tempe) — an outspoken atheist — drew the ire of some Republicans for welcoming Satanists to the Capitol. “This proposal isn’t even a dog whistle, this is a straight up attack on the rights of people and religion. Any religion that can be viewed by the sponsor or this committee if they view it to be a desecration to Christianity, you’re no longer safe in Arizona,” Mendez said in one of the bill’s hearings. [The bill passed its first hearings on party lines](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/SB1279S.pdf) with Republican support, but when it came to a vote of the whole chamber, Sens. J.D. Mesnard (R-Chandler) and Ken Bennett (R-Prescott) voted it down. Mesnard said he didn’t vote no because he is defending Satan — or defending Sparky the Sun Devil, the mascot of his alma mater, Arizona State University — but because he wants to protect religious freedom. “I’m obviously repulsed by Satanism, whatever that even means, but I oppose singling out a religious belief, however antithetical it may be to my own,” he said in a text. When it comes to Sparky, there’s some disagreement about whether the bill would affect him. In other words, if he represents a devil or the Devil, since ASU is indeed public property. Bill sponsor Sen. Jake Hoffman (R-Queen Creek), a Christian, said in a text that the idea of Sparky being affected by the bill is a “conspiracy theory” that is “laughable at best” and “moronic at worst.” There’s another reason he cited for the bill being necessary; [an incident that occurred in December in Iowa](https://apnews.com/article/satanic-temple-hate-crime-iowa-cb182f8b3235d25fd4949e0b2e4f43f7), where the state Capitol allows religious displays in the holiday season. The Satanic Temple of Iowa brought a Satanic altar to the Capitol, including a pagan statue, which was damaged by a man who was recently charged with felony mischief. “I find it ironic that in Iowa you can knock over a Satanic display and you go to jail for that, but at the U.S. Capitol you can have a gay sex orgy in a government building and there is zero consequence. That is abhorrent and disgusting,” Hoffman said. His second comment references another story from December wherein a leaked video showed a congressional staffer having sex in what appeared to be a government building. The senator that staffer worked for announced soon after that the staffer was fired. Hoffman argued that Satanism isn’t actually a religion, it’s the antithesis of it. “It is absolutely abhorrent that a Satanic memorial, statue, altar or display or any method or representation honoring Satan is displayed on public property,” Hoffman said. Members of Arizona’s Satanic Temple spoke in opposition to Hoffman’s bill — noting that it was designated as a religion by the IRS.",

    "text": "Former police officer sentenced for making an arrestee lick urine off the holding cell floor\nBy Jade Gordon, Anissa Carby and Navya Shukla, CNN\n(CNN) — A former Mississippi police officer was sentenced to a year in federal prison followed by a year of supervised release along with fines and assessments for forcing a man who he arrested to lick urine off the holding cell floor.\nMichael Christian Green was sentenced to the maximum penalty for a federal misdemeanor for acting under color of law to deprive a person of their civil rights. The former Pearl Police Department officer\nplead guilty in March and is scheduled to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on July 26.\nGreen worked for the Pearl Police Department for six months after working at other law enforcement agencies in Jackson, Mississippi. Pearl is in the same county where\nsix White former law enforcement officers, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” were sentenced on federal and state charges after pleading guilty to a racist assault on two innocent Black men.\nGreen responded to a disturbance at a Sam’s Club on December 23, 2023, and arrested a man, according to the complaint. Once the man was booked, security footage from the holding cell showed him trying to tell Green he needed to urinate, the federal prosecutor wrote in the complaint. After not receiving a response, the man urinated in a corner. When Green was later told about the urine, he demanded the arrestee lick the urine, threatening to beat him with a phone, the complaint said.\nWhile standing in the doorway of the holding cell, Green commanded the man to get on the ground and “suck it up,” according to the complaint, then “removed his phone from his duty vest and filmed” the man, who complied. Green resigned on December 27.\nGreen testified in federal court during his sentencing hearing and took responsibility for his actions and said he regrets what he did.\nCNN reached out to Green’s attorney for comment.\n“The City of Pearl, while not the sentencing body on this case, is glad to have this part of our recent history put behind us,” the municipality said in a statement. “The actions of Michael Green were reprehensible and inexcusable, and we have been deeply grieved to have been associated with this incident. We hope that this sentencing can help the victim and his family in their healing process, and we’re grateful to our federal partners who helped bring this terrible incident to justice swiftly.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months for contempt of Congress | WUNC",
    "text": "Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months for contempt of Congress Former Trump White House official Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison for contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. Navarro, who served as a trade adviser in the Trump administration, was convicted in September of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents and testimony related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He is the second former Trump insider to be convicted and sentenced for contempt of Congress. Steve Bannon was found guilty in 2022 of the same charges and sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon has appealed his conviction. \"You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution. You are not,\" Judge Amit Mehta told Navarro as he announced the sentence. \"You have received every process you are due. Every process.\" \"Your obligation as an American is to cooperate with Congress, to provide them with the information they were seeking,\" Mehta added. \"They have a job to do, and you made it harder. It's really that simple. It wasn't a kangaroo court. The public could see that.\" In addition to the four-month sentence, Mehta also ordered Navarro to pay a $9,500 fine. Prosecutors had asked the court for a six-month sentence. At Thursday's hearing, prosecutor John Crabb argued that Navarro \"believes he is above the law.\" \"The defendant brazenly defied Congress,\" Crabb said. \"The behavior cannot be countenanced.\" The defense, which has argued that executive privilege shielded Navarro from having to testify or produce documents to the committee, had asked for probation. They are expected to appeal his conviction. Navarro was not expected to speak at his sentencing, but ultimately did—against his attorneys wishes. He told the court that when he received the congressional subpoena he had \"an honest belief that the [executive] privilege had been invoked.\" He said the House committee should have either called former President Donald Trump or his attorneys to confirm it, or the panel should have told Navarro that there was a dispute about executive privilege. \"If they wanted the information, one phone call. That's it. We wouldn't be here,\" Navarro said. \"And if the lesson of this proceeding going forward is get a letter, get a lawyer, there's no need for this harsh punishment.\" His attorney, Stanley Woodward, echoed that point, saying: \"He need not be punished to prove a point. He acted the way he did because he thought he was duty-bound to do it.\" \"Forever more, presidential advisers will see this case as an advertisement of what not to do,\" Woodward added. Ahead of trial, Judge Mehta denied Navarro's executive privilege line of defense, ruling that Navarro had not established that Trump directed Navarro not to cooperate or invoked executive privilege. Mehta reiterated that point Thursday, saying that Navarro presented no evidence to confirm that Trump had invoked the privilege regarding Navarro. At last year's trial, the jury heard testimony from just three witnesses, none of them for the defense. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

Аферисты пообещали девушке крупный заработок и попросили пополнить \"брокерский\" счет. Своих денег у начинающего инвестора не было, и тогда женщина попросила подругу о помощи. ЗЯвительница поняла,что что-то не так, когда девушка показала ей \"личный кабинет\" брокерского приложения, где показывалась прибыль от совершенных сделок. Но все накопления в размере 1,4 млн рублей уже были отправлены на указанные счета. И вернуть их больше невозможно.\nРанее ИА IrkutskMedia писало, что за три дня 14 жителей Иркутской области стали жертвами телефонных и интернет-мошенников. Больше всего денег потеряли новички в \"инвестициях\", но в числе пострадавших — и студентка иркутского медуниверситета.",

    "text": "The first Advent candle is called the candle of hope, the hope of the faithful that God will fulfill His promises. Hope is also a theme for the new year, at least for those who make a list of New Year’s resolutions with the expectation (read: hope) that they will conform to them for 366 days.\nMaybe hope is what America needs now more than ever. Thirty minutes or less of watching cable news will challenge even the most optimistic among us. We are a nation at war with itself; we obsess with any differences we can assert against “them.”\nIt is hard to be an optimist these days. I avoid slipping into total pessimism by detouring into skepticism, a belief system for me that expects bad but still hopes for good. I have to be careful, though; full cynicism is at the door awaiting its chance.\nIs it reasonable to hold out hope that A.D. 2024 will be better than 2023? My discussion group talked this through at our December meeting. Even though America is bent on descending into woke hell, this group of conservatives still found reasons for hope.\nYes, we did spend some time bemoaning the state of affairs but our Socratic methodology, mildly enforced, led us to list what we thought were the reasons for our malaise. Only after clearly delineating with specificity could we see our way forward to a handful of changes we could make. Our ideas are ambitious but achievable . . . if we make the effort.\nWe decided the key to our solutions is to restore those American institutions which have declined due to conscious assaults by those who despise western civilization. Here is our list, ordered by organic level: the family, the neighborhood, religious and civic organizations and the larger community.\nEven though I remember little from my high school biology, I can see a structural metaphor from that discipline. The atom is the most basic building block, followed by the molecule, then the cell and finally the organism. Simplistic, but I was never very good at science. The point is that one must care for the most elemental building blocks for the structure to remain strong.\nNo doubt that is why the family, the atom in my metaphor, has been subjected to such vicious attacks by those determined to recreate American society the image of their nihilistic philosophy. I don’t need to rehearse the data about the number of children born out of wedlock, raised by a single parent or perhaps neither, and consigned to a life of poverty and little opportunity. Just compare outcomes of children raised in traditional, two-parent families. The data leave no room for intelligent debate.\nNext, consider the neighborhood. One of our group commented that a drive down a residential street will find all garage doors closed. No one is sitting outside welcoming neighbors to stop to talk. Kids are not playing in back yards because they are inside playing video games. Good luck finding multi-family barbeques on Saturday evening. Granted, these are exaggerations but the thesis holds.\nNow look at the status of our social institutions. One of our group reported that in my hometown of Fort Wayne weekly church attendance had dropped from 50 percent to nearly 10 percent. How active is your local Kiwanis or Lions club? Is the local school’s PTA meetings well attended? You know the answers as well as I.\nIt is no wonder that our communities are wracked with rancorous divisions. How can a community be healthy if its structure is rotting? Perhaps we should spend less time worrying about elections and focus that time on repairing those things closest to us.\nOne member suggested something so simple that, if I were in a cartoon, a light bulb would have appeared over my head. He asked what is the common denominator among all of us, regardless of status or background?\nGathering together over food.\nEven in the most dysfunctional families, they still eat. Social time with neighbors is enhanced by sharing a meal. Church potlucks are as American as baseball, and the service clubs meet around breakfast or lunch. We have to eat; why not make it a communal activity?\nBringing people together will strengthen the family, the neighborhood and our civic institutions. If that happens, how can our communities not recover as well?\nBefore I am accused of being a Pollyanna, I don’t expect peace on earth and goodwill to men to prevail in 2024. But, if we can all make the effort to spend more time with our families, our neighbors and others of our acquaintance, how can things not improve?\nPlus we all get to eat more while socializing with those we most treasure.\nHow can that be a bad thing?\nHappy New Year!",
