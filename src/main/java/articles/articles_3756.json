    "title": "Hospital, ASC partnerships soar in 2024: 3 things to know",
    "text": "The increased range and complexity of services that ASCs offer has opened the door for a new era of collaboration between ASCs and hospitals, both of whom stand to benefit from partnerships. Here are three other things to know about hospital and ASC partnerships in 2024: 1. A January survey of health system executives by VMG Health found that 60% of leaders were considering pursuing outpatient surgery joint ventures in 2024, the highest area of interest of any potential specialty partnerships. Additionally, Becker's reported on 55 hospitals and health systems opening ASCs in 2023. 2. Health system partnerships can be beneficial to ASCs in negotiating better rates with payers, as well as providing access to shared resources and partnerships with private equity or physician groups. \"Right now, we are renegotiating our payer contract because our rates are so low and we added service lines to the center,\" Kristopher Kitz, CEO of Wyatt Surgery Center in Tucson, Ariz., told Becker's . \"And the only reason why they will speak with us and even entertain materially better rates is because we have a health system affiliation.\" 3. In addition to the cost-savings power of migrating procedures to ASCs, they are often more preferable settings for both patients and physicians. \"[Hospitals] are either going to be part of that or they're going to lose in that race,\" Jim Freund, managing partner for Physician Transaction Advisors, told Becker's. \"So you see all the big consolidators out there, and even the smaller ones are creating partnerships with healthcare systems, whether it's an independent or a joint venture group.\" For example, Nashville, Tenn.-based Tenet Healthcare has been quickly selling off hospitals as growth quickly shifts to its ASC arm, United Surgical Partners International.",

    "title": "Could we see the Northern Lights tonight?",
    "text": "NEW ORLEANS — It's a natural phenomenon that happens so rarely. Thursday night there's a chance parts of Southeast Louisiana could see the Northern Lights. They dance across the night sky – vibrant pinks and greens showcasing nature's beauty. The Northern Lights are simply magical. Space weather forecaster, Shawn Dahl with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center said, \"It's a blast of solar material, billions of tons of it in fact, and a strong magnetic field is dragging it out into space towards Earth, that's left the sun a few days ago and arrived at earth this morning at exactly 9:15 a.m.\" The evening of October 10th isn't just any old Thursday evening, we could see a phenomenon in our own backyard. WWL Louisiana Meteorologist Peyton Malone says it's difficult for the lights to happen, that's what makes it so rare. He said, \"The northern lights are interesting because you get these charged particles that [have] traveled from the sun, they have raced our direction at a million miles an hour, that magnetic field is literally colliding with Earth's magnetic field and as those charged particles are coming into the atmosphere, they're excited that's why you get your colors.\" Now don't get too excited, but space weather forecasters say there's not a huge chance we will see the lights, but there's still a possibility. \"It's a magnetic storm, so it involves magnetism, so if you take two negative magnets and you try and put them together, they repel but if you have one opposite the other, they connect, magnets stick together. Same here with thing with the storm, we need that magnetic energy,\" Dahl said. The experts say because of light pollution in the city, you will have to leave New Orleans to see the Northern Lights, you could head to St Tammany Parish in the Folsom area, you could also head to Washington Parish or parts of Tangipahoa Parish. The key is to find the darkest parts of a rural area to see the lights. Remember to have your camera ready, because you may just be lucky enough to see nature's magical light display. Dahl said the best time to see the lights is usually the hours surrounding midnight.",

Take a cool shower or bath or move to a room with air conditioning.Check on adults you know that are at-risk for heat-related illness at least twice a day.Constantly monitor children for signs of heat-related illnesses.Heat-related illness (MDH)​Heat cramps: Short, severe cramps in the muscles of the leg, arm, or abdomen. This can happen during or after heavy exercise in extreme heat. Heavy sweating uses the body's supply of salts, which causes cramps. Heat cramps also may be a symptom of heat exhaustion.Heat exhaustion: Occurs when a person spends time in a hot environment without drinking enough fluids. Symptoms include extreme thirst, fatigue, weakness, clammy skin, nausea or vomiting, and rapid breathing.Heat stroke: The most serious heat-related illness. Heat stroke occurs when body temperature rises to as much as 106 degrees or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not provided. Symptoms of heat stroke include red, hot, and dry skin, no sweating, and rapid, weak pulse.WBAL-TV 11 Maryland Weather RadarApp users tap here for interactive radar.Maryland's 7-Day Weather ForecastAlert Days vs. Impact DaysYou may see the WBAL-TV 11 Weather Team highlight Alert Days or Impact Days in the forecasts.

    "text": "By Spotlight Newsroom ,\n5 hours ago Dear Editor,\nWhenever you have a large group of family or friends from out-of-town to visit, chances are they stay at a hotel in Albany County. What they probably don’t know is that a bill currently under consideration by the County Legislature would raise the cost of their visit by half-a-percent every night they’re in town.\nThe proposed raise to Albany County’s hotel occupancy tax may seem like small potatoes. For starters, it’s not a direct tax on County residents, and would mostly target out-of-towners. Second, the tax increase appears so small that it’s not worth scrutinizing. And finally, it would be creating a funding stream for County economic development, a goal my colleagues across party lines all share.\nSadly, as is the case every time government raises taxes, the choice we’ve been given versus the alternative could not be more stark.\nAlbany County collects a 6 percent tax on hotel occupancy, as well as 8 percent sales tax, or 14 percent total. If you’re staying two nights at one of the many places along Wolf Road or Central Avenue, that means you’d be paying anywhere from $8.40 to $35 for the privilege of that stay, according to recent rates. Adding a half-percent ($0.30 to $1.25) may not feel like much but add that to the other assorted fees on your room bill and the total runs up quickly. Whether you’re staying short-term, long-term, here for business or pleasure, would you rather pay extra in Albany County, or pay less for something comparable in lower-taxed Schenectady, Rensselaer or Saratoga Counties?\nThis increased tax is the definition of “death by a thousand cuts.”\nWe’d be cutting off our nose to spite our face with this tax, but the nuance goes deeper. A little-known fact: half of the current hotel tax proceeds are paid to the Albany Capital convention center authority fund, which is debt-free and in no need of the millions it collects from the tax every year. It’s the only state authority in New York funded by local tax dollars. Instead of considering a change to this outdated formula to better fund County economic development, our local Democratic representatives in state government are trying to force a tax raise without a better alternative.\nI’m happy to say my Republican and Conservative colleagues and I identified that better alternative. As a Conference, we proposed a bill redirecting existing revenue generated from commercial casino gaming to fund economic development. Revenue we collect from Rivers Casino is currently directed to the General Fund. Through phase-in and sunset clauses, and some creative accounting, we would avoid spending down our budget and surplus. It would also generate more funding for our efforts ($2.45 million annually when fully phased-in) than the increased hotel tax (less than $1 million annually).\nSurrounding counties have funded economic development for decades, and we need to play catch-up. Let’s be serious about providing a sustainable and adequate source to compete with neighboring counties like Saratoga and Schenectady, which both spend millions on economic development. As County leaders, protecting taxpayers and the local economy are top priorities. If we can sidestep raising taxes while stimulating job growth and opportunities, we should seize the opportunity. I hope my colleagues all agree this is a golden opportunity to do things with common sense.\nFrank Mauriello\nMinority Leader, Albany County Legislature\nThe post Letter to the Editor: New increase would be death by 1,000 cuts first appeared on Spotlight News .",
