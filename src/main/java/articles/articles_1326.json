    "text": "ONU otorga Premio a Libertad de Prensa a periodistas en Gaza La UNESCO dio su ‘Premio Mundial a la Libertad de Prensa’ a todas las personas palestinas que ejercen el periodismo en Gaza. La UNESCO otorgó el jueves (02.05.2024) su Premio Mundial a la Libertad de Prensa a todas las personas de origen palestino que ejercen el periodismo en Gaza, diezmadas desde hace casi siete meses por la ofensiva israelí en el territorio, tras el ataque del grupo terrorista Hamás en Israel. \"En estos tiempos de oscuridad y desesperanza, queremos transmitir un firme mensaje de solidaridad y reconocimiento a los periodistas palestinos que están cubriendo esta crisis en circunstancias tan dramáticas\", declaró el chileno Mauricio Weibel, presidente del Jurado Internacional de profesionales de los medios de comunicación. \"Como humanidad, tenemos una enorme deuda con su valentía y su compromiso con la libertad de expresión\", añadió en un comunicado. Audrey Azoulay -directora general de la organización de Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura- destacó por su parte \"la importancia del compromiso colectivo para garantizar que los periodistas de todo el mundo puedan seguir llevando a cabo su labor esencial de informar e investigar\". Según el Comité para la Protección de Periodistas (CPJ), con sede en Nueva York, al menos 97 reporteros -en su mayoría (92) palestinos- han sido asesinados desde que estalló la guerra entre Israel y Hamás el 7 de octubre de 2023. Otros 16 resultaron heridos. El conflicto estalló cuando comandos de Hamás atacaron el sur de Israel, matando a 1.170 personas, en su mayoría civiles, según un balance de la agencia AFP basado en datos israelíes. Asimismo, más de 250 personas fueron secuestradas. Israel afirma que 129 siguen en Gaza, de las cuales 34 habrían muerto. En respuesta, Israel prometió \"aniquilar\" a Hamás y lanzó una ofensiva que dejó hasta el momento 34.596 muertes en Gaza, en su mayoría civiles, según el Ministerio de Salud del territorio, gobernado por el movimiento islamista.",

    "text": "Paramount+ Cancels Wolf Pack After One Season\nSarah Michelle Gellar's Teen Wolf offshoot will not return for Season 2.\nThe latest extension of the Teen Wolf franchise has been declawed. On Thursday, reports confirmed that a second season of\n[Wolf Pack](/category/wolf-pack/), the series that spun out of the events of 2022's [Teen Wolf: The Movie](/category/teen-wolf-the-movie-noncomicmovie/), is no longer in the works at Paramount+. Wolf Pack, which starred and was executive produced by Buffy the Vampire Slayer star [Sarah Michelle Gellar](/category/sarah-michelle-gellar-actor/), premiered its first season in early 2023. According to the reporting surrounding the cancellation, the decision was partially made after production delays caused by last year's actors and writers strikes meant that Season 2 of Wolf Pack wouldn't premiere until 2025. That extended hiatus would reportedly require Paramount+ to spend more money to market Season 2.\n\"Well, after just about a full year of uncertainty, the hammer finally fell today in Hollywood and news came out that Wolf Pack has been officially cancelled,\" Edo Van Belkom, who wrote the Wolf Pack novel the series was based on, wrote on social media. Disappointing, of course, especially since all signs pointed to there being a season two. But, while the show was a success, the WGA strike, followed by the SAG strike did the series no favors... I'm sad myself, season two was going to see me have a cameo and another set visit, but I was just having fun and playing in Hollywood for a bit. I feel more for the young actors and others who felt this was going to be their big break.\"\nWell, after just about a full year of uncertainty, the hammer finally fell today in Hollywood and news came out that Wolf Pack has been officially cancelled.— Edo van Belkom (@EdovanBelkom)\n[pic.twitter.com/kP8pqNUbn2] [January 24, 2024]\nWhat Is Wolf Pack About?\nWolf Pack follows a teenage boy and girl whose lives are changed forever when a California wildfire awakens a terrifying supernatural creature and drives it to attack a highway traffic jam beneath the burning hills. Wounded in the chaos, the boy and girl are inexplicably drawn to each other and to two other teenagers who were adopted sixteen years earlier by a park ranger after another mysterious wildfire. As the full moon rises, all four teens come together to unravel the secret that connects them – the bite and blood of a werewolf. In addition to Gellar,\nthe cast of Wolf Pack consisted of Armani Jackson, Bella Shepard, Chloe Rose Robertson, Tyler Lawrence Gray, Rodrigo Santoro, and Chase Liefeld.\n\"There is definitely a path that he could follow. There's definitely a lot of things that have already happened that can play out that we can see on screen,\" Liefeld\npreviously told ComicBook.com about a potential Season 2 of Wolf Pack. \"Integrating into society, coming to terms with what he's done, all these things. He's definitely got a lot of things he'll be fighting [in a possible] next season. Maybe physically, maybe mentally. There's going to be no shortage of obstacles in his way if season two does come along. We'll see what happens.\"\nWhat do you think of Wolf Pack being cancelled by Paramount+? Are you sad that the series won't be getting a Season 2? Share your thoughts with us in the comments below!\n[0comments](#)",

    "title": "FIRST ALERT: Snow tonight, major winter storm possible by late weekend",
    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Snow tonight, major winter storm possible by late weekend We are tracking two winter storm systems that combined could very well double our current seasonal snowfall total, which stands at 9.4 inches. The first system will bring a couple of inches, perhaps a little more, to the Mankato area from late this evening into Friday morning. There is a winter weather advisory for counties north and east of the Mankato area where amounts will be slightly higher. The second system could very well be our most significant winter storm system so far this winter season. There is a high likelihood of a long-duration winter storm system, which could produce heavy snow, strong winds, rain, and even some ice. Snow will begin late Saturday night into Sunday morning with precipitation continuing through Monday night and possibly even through most of Tuesday. We have a lot to talk about. Here is a detailed breakdown of the two systems. TONIGHT / FRIDAY MORNING Timing: Snow will develop across far western Minnesota late Thursday afternoon and develop east and southeastward into Thursday evening. Snow is expected to reach the Mankato area by mid-Thursday evening, continuing through the night and ending around or shortly after daybreak on Friday. Snow will exit from northwest to southeast Friday morning. A second band of snow is likely along and south of I-90 late tonight. This band will start as rain but change to snow as temperatures drop overnight. Snowfall amounts here will depend on when the rain changes to snow. Amounts: In the Mankato area, snowfall amounts will be around 2 inches, with some locations getting up to three inches. Amounts will gradually be higher north and east of Mankato with lesser amounts to the west and south. The exception to the south will be locations along and south of I-90 where an enhanced area of precipitation will develop late tonight. Precipitation will begin as rain but is expected to change to snow. Snow amounts will depend on when that change happens. If it happens earlier, snow amounts will be higher. Snow forecast as of 2pm Wednesday 3/20/2024: Here are the latest Watches, Warnings and Advisories: LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY The second system we are tracking is much more significant and will likely be the most impactful winter storm we’ve had so far this winter season. Based on our latest long-range forecast model data, a 6+ inch snowfall event is looking more and more likely. It’s still early, making it too soon to pinpoint where the heaviest snow will fall. However, current estimates suggest a “low end” range of 3 to 6 inches and a “high end” range of 8 to 12 inches. We will probably end up somewhere in between, but this could all change based on where the system develops, where it ends up tracking, and how much precipitation falls as snow versus rain. Those are all things that we won’t be able to narrow down for another couple of days. In regard to timing, snow could potentially start as early as Saturday evening with the potential for heavy snow Sunday and Sunday night. During that time, it will also be very windy with easterly gusts of 40+ mph. Warmer air will wrap into the system Sunday night into Monday, at which point snow will change to rain. Rain will be likely through much of Monday, with rain changing back to snow with colder air on the backside of the system Monday night through Tuesday. Keep in mind, all of this is very preliminary as we are still several days away from the onset of this system. That said, if you have travel plans from late Saturday through early next week, check the weather and check it often because it is looking more and more likely that you will have to make some changes.

It included 12% raises.\nUnion leaders spent the week in Pittsburgh taking part in workshops on labor law, mid-contract negotiations and strike preparation.

    "text": "Soudan: les habitants de Khartoum en guerre survivent grâce à la soupe populaire\nLa guerre au Soudan et la crise humanitaire qui continue de s’aggraver. D’après les Nations unies, le conflit a provoqué la plus importante crise alimentaire au monde et les premiers cas de famine déclarée depuis 2017. Près de 25 millions de Soudanais souffrent d’insécurité alimentaire aigüe, soit près de la moitié de la population du pays. À Khartoum, la capitale, les déplacés commencent à rentrer, mais ont bien du mal à trouver de quoi se nourrir.\nPublié le :\nAvec notre envoyée spéciale au Soudan, Gaëlle Laleix\nDevant la mosquée du quartier de Burri à Khartoum, la capitale du Soudan, Haïthiam Mohammed Alawad distribue de grandes gamelles de haricots rouges. Il gère cette soupe populaire depuis le début de la guerre. « On a cuisiné beaucoup de légumes, des haricots. On a aussi de la salade. On fournit le petit déjeuner, le déjeuner et du riz pour le dîner. Environ 190 personnes viennent chaque jour. On note les repas sur une carte ».\nBurri est dévasté par les combats et les pillages. Pour ses habitants, comme Habib Mohammed Ali Mustapha, la soupe populaire représente le seul moyen de survivre. « On n’a ni argent, ni nourriture chez moi. Je n’ai jamais quitté Khartoum. Durant toute la guerre, je suis venu chercher ma nourriture ici. Tous les habitants du quartier, on venait se nourrir ici. Deux repas chaque jour ».\nLa soupe populaire financée par la diaspora\nCe sont les Soudanais de la diaspora qui financent les soupes populaires de la capitale. Mahmoud Salah, ingénieur, vient chaque jour. Il n’a pas les moyens de suivre l’inflation. « La nourriture coûte très cher, car on est dans une période d’après-guerre. 1 kilo de viande coûte 24 000 livres soudanaises. Aujourd’hui, 6 pains coûtent 1 000 livres soudanaises. Avant, on en achetait 24 pour le même prix. La différence est énorme ».\nD’après le Programme alimentaire mondiale, le prix du panier moyen au Soudan, a augmenté de 134% en un an.\nÀ lire aussiSoudan: les déplacés de retour retrouvent leurs maisons en ruines\nNewsletterRecevez toute l'actualité internationale directement dans votre boite mail\nJe m'abonne",
