    "text": "Google Makes It Easier to Erase Your Unwanted Personal Info from the Web\nToggle Dark Mode\nThree years ago, Google debuted Results About You, a new tool to let you know where your personal information was showing up on the web and help you remove anything you don’t want to be out there. It’s a handy way to protect your privacy, but it hasn’t always been obvious where to find it or how to use it.\nThankfully, the search giant has just improved that, announcing a new design that will make it easier to sign up for the tool and request that unwanted information be removed. More significantly, it will also offer proactive monitoring, saving you the time of visiting the Results About You page to see what’s changed. Instead, Google will alert you when new results are found.\nThis Limited-Time Microsoft Office Deal Gets You Lifetime Access for Just $39\nSick and tired of subscriptions? Get a lifetime license for Microsoft Office Home and Business 2021 at a great price!\nWhile registering for Results About You requires you to give Google the personal information it needs to scan for, including your name and current and former phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. Google notes that the info you give the tool “is not shared or used to personalize your experience across other Google products.”\nHowever, the real catch is that Results About You wasn’t easy to find. Google’s iPhone app highlighted it, but it was pretty buried in the web interface, whether on mobile or desktop. This week’s changes feature a redesigned hub that will be more prominently displayed, plus tighter integration to let you remove offending information directly from the search results.\nClicking the three-dot menu beside any search result now shows a Remove result button on the info bar that pops out from the side. This will be available even if you didn’t conduct the search from Results About You and can actually be applied to any result — although Google will presumably ignore any spurious removal requests.\nSelecting Remove result lets you choose from three options, including removing personal information. This will ask you to identify what personal information you’d like removed, with categories that include contact info, government ID numbers, financial info, passwords & signatures, restricted “highly personal” records like medial documents, other “other” things like inappropriate images or details on a person under 18 years old.\nYou can also file a legal removal request for copyright infringement or illegal activity, or refresh outdated information. This last option can be applied to any web page, but in this context it’s most relevant for situations where you’ve had information corrected or removed from a website but it has yet to be reflected in Google’s search results. The option reindexes the website in question to update its information. It’s unclear if this happens immediately, but it’s presumably at least prioritized so it happens more quickly than simply waiting for Google’s next regular visit to the page.\nThe standard Results About You tool remains available as a way to see a summary of any personal information that Google has found about you, but the new Remove result button lets you submit removal requests more organically while you’re browsing through results. These tools are currently available to users in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, Brazil, France, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Thailand, but Google will be expanding it to more countries in the future.",

    "text": "Allied Gaming Bounces Back: Strategic investment from Elite Fun Entertainment, A Stepping-Stone to Recoveryn From Setback to Comeback: Allied Gaming and Entertainment Inc. Leverages Investment from Elite Fun Entertainment amidst Revenue Slump.\nPublished / Modified Dec 28 2023\nCSIMarket Team / CSIMarket.com\nAllied Gaming & Entertainment,Inc. (NASDAQ: AGAE) is not just a company; it is the harbor of imaginative and immersive entertainment experiences delivered across the globe.By making supreme use of advanced technology and interactive exhibits, AGAE unfailingly presents its clients with a one-of-a-kind entertainment experience that surpasses the conventional norms of amusement. Their quality services have been appreciated far and wide, and they stand as a trusted name in the global entertainment industry.\nOn the other hand, Elite Fun Entertainment Co., an influential purveyor of cultural and theatrical affairs in Macau, is equally distinguished for its prowess in directing live events across Asia, and especially in the thriving area of China's Greater Bay. This expertize has given them a significant position amidst the Asian cultural and entertainment sectors.\nThis investment by Elite Fun Entertainment is viewed as a dynamic collaboration that couples the robust experiential entertainment capacities of AGAE with the live event mastery of the investing company.\nDespite a tough financial quarter for Allied Gaming & Entertainment Inc., which saw a revenue slump of 28.47% YoY in Q3 2023, this move seems to be a well-thought-out play in the grander scheme of things. While most of AGAE's\ncompetitors reported an average revenue surge of 5.38% in the same period, Allied Gaming & Entertainment Inc. managed to attain higher profitability. With a substantial net margin of 6.72%, AGAE outshines its competitors regarding profitability metrics.\nThe 3rd quarter also saw Allied Gaming and Entertainment Inc. turn a corner, bringing home a net profit of $0.08 million, contrasting considerably with the net loss of $1.64 million it bore in the same quarter the previous year.\nAs the collaboration crystalizes, all eyes remain on how AGAE uses this alliance to further leverage its profitability and turn revenue adversity into an opportunity.\nCreative\nPrevious News\n<a href=\"https://csimarket.com/news/breaking_news_leading_law_firm_encourages_milestone_pharmaceuticals_inc_investors_to_inquire_about_securities_class_action_investigation_into_potentially_mis2023-12-28210107\">\nBREAKING NEWS: Leading Law Firm Encourages Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc Investors to Inquire About Securities Class Action Investigation into Potentially Misleading Business Information </a> <a href=\"https://csimarket.com/news/allied-gaming-bounces-back-strategic-investment-from-elite-fun-entertainment-a-stepping-stone-to-recoveryn-from-setback-2023-12-28210115\">\nAllied Gaming Bounces Back: Strategic investment from Elite Fun Entertainment, A Stepping-Stone to Recoveryn From Setback to Comeback: Allied Gaming and Entertainment Inc.

    "title": "SHINE Humanity Leads Charge for Better Healthcare in Pakistan: Key Figures Rally Support",
    "text": "At the heart of Pakistan's ongoing healthcare debate, a recent fundraiser hosted by SHINE Humanity has sparked significant conversations among key political and health figures. Saleem Mandviwala, Zafar Mirza, and other prominent individuals addressed urgent health concerns, underlining preventive care's importance and calling for widespread support from both governmental and non-governmental sectors. The event not only highlighted SHINE's critical role in providing healthcare to underserved areas but also served as a rallying call for enhanced health measures nationwide.\nVoices for Change\nDuring the fundraiser, Saleem Mandviwala stressed the dire need for Pakistan to shift its focus towards preventive healthcare to counteract the rising illness rates that starkly contrast with global standards. Meanwhile, Zafar Mirza, lauded SHINE Humanity's efforts in addressing healthcare challenges and urged for collaborative efforts to improve the health landscape across the country. Their speeches underscored a common theme: the necessity of preemptive actions and comprehensive healthcare strategies to combat the prevalent issues affecting Pakistan's health sector.\nSHINE Humanity's Mission\nSHINE Humanity's commitment to improving healthcare accessibility in marginalized communities, especially in Sindh, was highlighted by Dr. Asghar Naqvi. Through extensive data collection and targeted interventions, SHINE aims to address the most pressing health concerns. This approach is informed by evidence, such as the findings from a study published in Child Indicators Research, which paints a grim picture of child health disparities in Punjab, emphasizing the urgent need for action.\nAssessing Child Health Disparities reveals alarming statistics on malnutrition and vaccination rates, advocating for a declaration of a health emergency in Pakistan.\nCommunity Support and Recognition\nSarwar Peshimam, representing the Rotary Club Sunset Platinum, commended SHINE Humanity's impactful contributions towards addressing Pakistan's health challenges. The organization's dedication to healthcare provision and its efforts in improving health statistics through effective initiatives have garnered widespread appreciation and support. This collective backing from various sectors underscores the critical importance of unified action in tackling the healthcare crisis, setting a precedent for future endeavors.\nThe recent SHINE Humanity fundraiser not only served as a platform for discussing Pakistan's healthcare needs but also as a catalyst for change. By bringing together influential figures to advocate for preventive care and comprehensive health strategies, the event has laid the groundwork for a stronger, healthier Pakistan. As the country grapples with significant health challenges, the support and initiatives of organizations like SHINE Humanity offer a beacon of hope for a better future.",
