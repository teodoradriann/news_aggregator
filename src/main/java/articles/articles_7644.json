    "text": "By Mubasher Bukhari\nLAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) – At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said.\nThe crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district.\nA large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital.\nAt least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader.\n“They burned one house and lynched several Christians,” Bhatti aid.\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street.\nBhatti said the videos were images from the scene.\nReuters could not independently verify the pictures.\nThe independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was “at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs”.\nBlasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\nWhile blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\nA Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.\n(Writing by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Mike Harrison)",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Lafayette County, Mississippi from 1901-2000 was 43.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Lafayette County, Mississippi experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Lafayette County, Mississippi history.",

    "text": "Since the moment he took office, Joe Biden and his administration have engaged in a full-fledged campaign to weaponize the federal government against their political opponents and people of faith. Recently, 11 anti-abortion protesters were convicted for peacefully protesting and praying at a Tennessee abortion clinic in 2021. Their crime? Arriving at an abortion clinic before it opened and sitting in prayer while handing out flyers that shared the value of human life. These pro-life activists were convicted under the \\\"Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances\\\" (FACE) Act, a 1994 statute that makes it a federal crime to interfere in any way with a person’s attempt to get medical services. Initially, the FACE Act was passed to protect both the supposed right to access abortions and the right to protest peacefully, as well as the safety of churches and pregnancy centers. Sadly, churches and pregnancy resource centers have been subject to a spree of violent attacks in the wake of the Dobbs decision, to which the Biden administration has turned a blind eye. BIDEN'S TEAM INSISTTS PRESIDENT IS FIT TO SERVE. SO LET'S SEE THE HUR TAPES, TRANSCRIPTS AND RECORDINGS However, under the Biden administration’s weaponized Justice Department, the FACE Act is primarily being used to go after people of faith who stand up for what they believe and protest to protect innocent life. Each of these 11 peaceful protesters now faces up to 10 and a half years in prison and fines of up to $260,000 for participating in that day of prayerful protest. Luckily, Congressman Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have moved to repeal the FACE Act and replace it with a bill of their own, titled the \\\"Restoring the First Amendment and Right to Peaceful Civil Disobedience\\\" Act, which would prevent the Biden administration from weaponizing the federal government against Christian conservatives. But the weaponization of government against conservatives and people of faith doesn’t end there. After a man took down a Satanist statute that was placed in the Iowa state Capitol building last December, he was charged with a felony hate crime. PRO-LIFE PROTESTERS CONVICTED OF VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW FOR BLOCKING ABORTION CLINIC DOOR Iowa law defines this as a violation of individual rights, even though the Satanic temple explicitly admits it is not a religious organization with a belief in a higher power. Not only is Iowa making a mockery of the free exercise of religious rights by treating the Satanists as a religious organization, but Iowa is also making a mockery of the justice system by labeling this destruction of property as a hate crime. Perhaps even more disturbingly, in 2021, the Biden administration released a memo instructing the Department of Justice to go after concerned parents at school board meetings after receiving a letter that compared these parents to \\\"domestic terrorists.\\\" Last year, it was also revealed that the FBI mounted a spying program on traditional Catholics (particularly those interested in the Latin Mass) and identified them as individuals who might be part of the \\\"far-right nationalist movement.\\\" In the eyes of the Biden Department of Justice, these Christian patriots are the actual threat to the American way of life – not the criminals who are carjacking, terrorizing and even killing everyday Americans in our cities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Many of these conservative Christians are facing harsher penalties than those who committed acts of arson and vandalism in the BLM riots of 2020 and even the six illegal immigrants who recently assaulted multiple police officers in New York City, five of whom were released on bail. The administration has clearly made use of the justice system against their political enemies. It’s clear they consider everyone who opposes their views as their enemies as well. These unprecedented acts of weaponization of the Justice Department prove that the Biden administration is eager to deploy the full force of the federal government against its perceived political enemies while letting real crimes, such as the D.C. riots and the destruction of federal property, go unpunished. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Americans continue to fall victim to rising crime and violence in their neighborhoods, the Biden administration should focus on keeping our communities safe and putting real criminals behind bars. The Department of Justice should never be used as a weaponized arm of the executive branch to harass, intimidate, and stifle political opposition. The American people should demand better from the Biden administration. If President Biden continues to go after Christians and other people of faith while letting the real criminals run free, \\\"justice\\\" remains nowhere to be found in the DOJ except for its name.

    "title": "Syphilis Surge: 2.9x Rise & Teen Parent Risks in Thailand",
    "text": "Thailand Faces a Silent Epidemic: The Converging Crises of HIV and Syphilis and the Looming Threat of Untreatable STIs A staggering 300% increase in combined HIV and syphilis cases, particularly among young adults aged 15-24, is rapidly reshaping Thailand’s public health landscape. While recent data reveals a national HIV prevalence of over 540,000 with 13,000 new infections, the parallel surge in syphilis – spiking by 2.9x in five key provinces – signals a dangerous trend. This isn’t simply a resurgence of known diseases; it’s a harbinger of a future where antibiotic resistance renders common STIs untreatable, potentially reversing decades of public health gains.\nThe Geographic Hotspots and Vulnerable Populations The provinces of Bangkok, Chonburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, and two others (as reported by Bangkokbiznews, komchadluek, and LINE TODAY) are currently experiencing the most dramatic increases in syphilis cases. This concentration isn’t accidental. These areas often represent hubs of economic activity, migration, and tourism – factors that can accelerate disease transmission. Crucially, the disproportionate impact on young adults, including pregnant women, highlights a critical gap in preventative education and access to healthcare. The risk to newborns from congenital syphilis is particularly alarming, leading to severe health complications and even mortality.\nBeyond the Numbers: The Rise of Multi-Drug Resistant Syphilis The current crisis isn’t just about increased infection rates; it’s about the evolving nature of the pathogens themselves. Globally, and increasingly in Southeast Asia, we’re witnessing the emergence of azithromycin-resistant Treponema pallidum , the bacterium that causes syphilis. Azithromycin is a key antibiotic used to treat the disease, and its diminishing effectiveness threatens to render syphilis a far more difficult and costly infection to manage. This resistance is driven by overuse of antibiotics, both for syphilis and other infections, and underscores the urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship programs.\nThe Intertwined Epidemics: HIV and Syphilis Co-infection The simultaneous rise in HIV and syphilis is particularly concerning. Co-infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission, accelerates disease progression, and complicates treatment. Individuals with syphilis are more susceptible to HIV infection, and vice versa. This synergistic effect creates a vicious cycle that demands a coordinated public health response. The Thai government’s recent initiative to promote HIV self-testing (ThaiPR.NET) is a positive step, but it must be coupled with comprehensive syphilis screening and treatment programs.\nThe Role of Social Determinants of Health Addressing this epidemic requires acknowledging the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to its spread. Poverty, lack of access to education, stigma surrounding sexual health, and limited access to healthcare services all play a role. Targeted interventions are needed to reach vulnerable populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender individuals. These interventions must be culturally sensitive and address the specific needs of each community.\nThe Future of STI Control: Towards a Tech-Enabled, Proactive Approach Looking ahead, the future of STI control in Thailand – and globally – will depend on embracing innovative technologies and adopting a more proactive, preventative approach. This includes:\nPoint-of-Care Diagnostics: Rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostic tests that can be deployed in community settings are crucial for early detection and treatment. Digital Contact Tracing: Utilizing mobile technology to anonymously notify individuals who may have been exposed to an infection. AI-Powered Risk Prediction: Developing algorithms that can identify individuals at high risk of infection based on demographic data, behavioral patterns, and geographic location. Novel Vaccine Development: Investing in research to develop effective vaccines against both HIV and syphilis. Enhanced Surveillance Systems: Implementing real-time surveillance systems to track infection rates, identify emerging trends, and monitor antibiotic resistance. The current situation demands a paradigm shift from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. Ignoring the converging crises of HIV and syphilis will not only lead to increased morbidity and mortality but also threaten to undermine decades of progress in public health. The time for decisive action is now.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the Future of STI Control in Thailand What is the biggest threat posed by antibiotic-resistant syphilis? The biggest threat is the potential for syphilis to become untreatable with currently available antibiotics, leading to severe health complications, increased transmission rates, and a resurgence of congenital syphilis.\nHow can technology help to combat the spread of STIs? Technology can play a crucial role through point-of-care diagnostics, digital contact tracing, AI-powered risk prediction, and enhanced surveillance systems, enabling faster detection, targeted interventions, and more effective prevention strategies.\nWhat role does education play in preventing the spread of STIs? Education is paramount. Comprehensive sexual health education, free from stigma, is essential to empower individuals to make informed decisions, practice safe sex, and seek timely testing and treatment.\nWhat can be done to address the social determinants of health that contribute to STI transmission? Addressing poverty, improving access to education and healthcare, reducing stigma, and providing targeted support to vulnerable populations are crucial steps in tackling the social determinants of health that drive STI transmission.\nWhat are your predictions for the future of STI control in Thailand?

    "text": "[Europe](../)\nFrance temporarily bans oyster production in Arcachon over norovirus\nMultiple people were sick over Christmas, with authorities saying reports indicated it was linked to oysters.\nFrench authorities have temporarily banned the fishing, harvesting and marketing of shellfish from a bay in the southwestern part of the country after detecting the presence of norovirus in oysters.\nNorovirus spreads through contaminated food or surfaces and can cause severe vomiting and diarrhoea.\nAs of December 27, “batches of shellfish harvested or fished in these areas must be withdrawn from sale,”\n[regional authorities](//www.gironde.gouv.fr/Actualites/Communiques-de-presse/Communiques-de-presse-2023/Decembre-2023/Interdiction-temporaire-des-coquillages) in southwestern France said.\n“People who have shellfish from these areas are asked not to consume them and to return them to the point of sale,” they added.\nThe oysters were linked to several cases of foodborne illness, authorities said, with investigations still underway. But analyses carried out directly on the oysters found the presence of norovirus.\nNo serious cases of the illness have been reported to date, authorities added.\nFor\n[oyster](//www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/23/meet-the-company-using-discarded-oyster-shells-to-cut-energy-costs-and-keep-frances-buildi) producers, the ban is hard to stomach as the shellfish is especially popular during the holidays.\nArcachon’s regional shellfish farming committee said in a statement that they had a “heavy heart”, adding that norovirus is not naturally present in the seawater.\n“It is clear that Arcachon Bay and, as a result, the oyster farming profession, are victims of the saturation of wastewater and rainwater networks, overflowing into the natural environment and contaminating production areas,” the committee said.\nThe majority of norovirus foodborne illnesses in France are linked to eating contaminated shellfish, and in particular to eating raw oysters.\nFoodborne illness can also lead to transmission between people.\nIt is recommended to wash your hands, avoid handling food when you have gastroenteritis symptoms, and wash raw fruits and vegetables before eating them to limit exposure to norovirus.\n“Preventing contaminated oysters from ending up on consumers’ plates is the top priority for professionals, even if it comes with very serious economic consequences,” the regional shellfish farming committee added.\nFrance is the top European country that produces and consumes oysters, with an industry turnover of €403 million per year.\n[World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../../us-news) [Source link](//www.euronews.com/next/2023/12/28/oysters-in-frances-arcachon-bay-temporarily-banned-after-norovirus-detected)",

    "title": "Foto de base israelense destruída após ataque do Hezbollah foi gerada por IA | Aos Fatos",
    "text": "É falsa a imagem que supostamente mostraria a base aérea israelense de Ramat David destruída após um ataque do Hezbollah. A foto contém diversas inconsistências comuns em conteúdos gerados por ferramentas de [inteligência artificial](https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/?tag=inteligencia-artificial). Ainda que o grupo xiita libanês de fato tenha atacado a base aérea, [autoridades israelenses](https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/?tag=israel) disseram ter interceptado a maior parte dos mísseis. A imagem falsa viralizou principalmente no exterior, mas circula em língua portuguesa no Telegram e no Bluesky. Ramat David, base aérea na Palestina Ocupada, próximo de Haifa. Fotos vazadas... Publicações têm compartilhado uma imagem gerada por IA como se fosse um registro da base aérea israelense de Ramat David destruída após um ataque do grupo xiita Hezbollah. A foto contém uma série de inconsistências, que indicam que foi gerada artificialmente (veja abaixo): - Os veículos militares que aparecem na imagem estão distorcidos e se fundem; - O texto que aparece ao lado de um dos caminhões contém letras que não existem no [alfabeto hebraico](https://www.jewfaq.org/hebrew_alphabet); - A janela que aparece logo atrás do poste também está distorcida; - Esse mesmo poste também parece estar flutuando. A foto falsa viralizou principalmente em inglês e em espanhol — e foi desmentida por sites como a [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-these-images-dont-show-hezbollah-strikes-on-israel/a-70312934) e a [France24](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20240924-this-viral-image-of-the-ramat-david-airbase-hezbollah-attack-is-ai-generated). Os veículos apontaram também inconsistências no formato do fogo e na estrutura do avião. A imagem falsa também não se parece com outros registros da base aérea [disponíveis na internet](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/266436325/ramat-david-airbase/?locale=pt_PT). O próprio Hezbollah divulgou um [vídeo](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-publishes-drone-footage-of-ramat-david-airbase-in-north/) do local feito por drones no qual não é possível ver uma pista semelhante à da foto das peças de desinformação. É fato, no entanto, que houve [um ataque à base aérea](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/internacional/hezbollah-diz-que-lancou-foguetes-contra-base-aerea-no-norte-de-israel/) no início da semana. O Hezbollah afirmou ter disparado “dezenas de foguetes” em direção a Ramat David em retaliação ao avanço militar israelense no Líbano. O exército de Israel disse que foram lançados cerca de dez projéteis, e que apenas um deles não foi interceptado. Um homem teria sofrido ferimentos leves por conta dos estilhaços da explosão. O caminho da apuração Aos Fatos realizou uma busca reversa da imagem e encontrou a foto apenas em publicações pouco confiáveis ou em sites que desmentiam sua veracidade. A reportagem, então, fez uma análise para buscar na imagem inconsistências que são comuns em conteúdos gerados por IA. Para construir o contexto da checagem, também procuramos informações sobre o ataque do Hezbollah tanto na imprensa internacional como em veículos brasileiros.",
