    "text": "A diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) sounds like the end of the road.\nFortunately, it’s not.\n“Depression, even if it proves to be stubborn, is a very treatable condition,” says psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Mazda Adli, head of the affective disorders research division at Charité university hospital in Berlin, Germany.\nSo if your doctor says your depression is “treatment-resistant,” it doesn’t mean nothing more can be done for you.\nThe term is used when adequate dosages of at least two different antidepressants, administered for four to six weeks, don’t improve your symptoms.\n“It’s very important to make clear that ‘treatment-resistant’ doesn’t mean you aren’t treatable, but that your depression is simply refractory to treatment,” Dr Adli says.\nThis isn’t unusual, he says, noting that about one-third of patients with major depressive disorders don’t respond to initial treatment with two antidepressants.\n“Patients, their relatives, and also the doctors then need plenty of staying power and patience with treatment,” says Dr Adli.\nThere are many ways to help people with depression, he adds, even when medications – and perhaps a first go at psychotherapy – have little effect at the outset.\nShould standard treatment methods fail to improve a patient’s depression, doctors move on to a clearly specified step-by-step plan – and even look beyond it – until improvement is achieved.\nAlternative methods\nPossible options are set down in guidelines for the medicinal and psychotherapeutic treatment of depression.\nThey include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).\nECT involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain, under general anaesthesia, that induces a cerebral seizure lasting about a minute.\nThis causes electrical and chemical changes in the brain. Psychotherapy or talk therapy refers to a variety of treatments that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviours.\nIn rTMS, a magnetic coil placed against the patient’s scalp delivers magnetic pulses that stimulate brain areas that regulate mood.\nWhile both are proven methods of brain stimulation, less evidence has been gathered to date on the effectiveness of rTMS in improving TRD symptoms.\nDr Andrea Jungaberle, a Berlin-based clinical specialist in anaesthesia and emergency medicine, says it’s important that doctors and TRD patients together seek further treatment options.\nDr Jungaberle, who is also a psychedelic therapist researching on the therapeutic application of altered states of consciousness – including for depression, says many doctors, herself included, see substances previously known more as narcotics as giving new hope in treating depression.\nOne of them is esketamine.\nEsketamine is a more potent version of ketamine, an established anaesthetic that’s also used as a recreational drug (“special K” is one of its street names) and can have hallucinogenic effects.\nIn recent years, esketamine nasal spray has been approved in some places for short-term, emergency treatment of severe depression as well as TRD.\nDr Gerhard Gründer, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Department of Molecular Neuroimaging at the Central Institute of Mental Health (ZI) in Mannheim, Germany, heads a study on the antidepressant effects of psilocybin, a hallucinogenic substance obtained from certain types of (“magic”) mushrooms.\nTesting underway\nAt ZI and Charité, 144 TRD patients are being given psilocybin under the supervision of psychotherapists, who prepare them for the experience and then review it with them afterwards.\nAs Dr Gründer emphasises, the method is not comparable to a self-experiment with drugs: “Truffles containing psilocybin are legal in the Netherlands, where you can purchase them in shops,” he says.\n“But taking a substance like this is by no means a treatment, which must be well prepared and subsequently evaluated.”\nDr Adli, too, underscores the importance of taking hallucinogenic substances only under medical supervision.\n“After taking them, some people have dissociative experiences,” he says.\n“The feeling, for example, that they’re floating through the room, that colours or sound intensities change.\n“Some people don’t find this at all unpleasant. Others do. And some don’t notice anything at all.”\nAs Dr Gründer explains, clinical trials of alternative treatments such as this are aimed at determining their safety and effectiveness for possible approval by regulatory authorities.\n“The euphoria needs to be dampened a bit. In the media – in some articles anyway – psychedelics are touted as a panacea,” he says, pointing out that a large number of effective antidepressants are already available, however.\n“At the end of the day, psychedelics are simply a very practical – and probably promising – addition to our treatment arsenal.”\nWhen it comes to research on the use of psychedelic drugs for medical purposes, Germany, according to Dr Jungaberle, is an international laggard.\n“(Research) has been going on considerably longer in Switzerland, and there are studies in Great Britain, the Netherlands and Czech Republic,” she says.\n“Germany has now jumped on the bandwagon, but we’re about five to 10 years behind.”\nDr Adli, for his part, would embrace innovative treatments for depression.\n“We need to develop new antidepressants, and further develop existing ones,” he says.\n“Depression is a very common illness. A particular antidepressant won’t help everyone, and more treatment options mean greater treatability.”\nPsychotherapy is an integral part of treatment for stubborn cases of depression, he notes, adding that physical activity, a balanced circadian rhythm and learning self-care behaviour can enhance treatment effectiveness. – dpa\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "'Grinding' O's look to kick into gear for stretch run LOS ANGELES -- A late-August showdown between the Orioles and the Dodgers -- two of MLB’s top teams this season -- had a big-time feel during the seventh inning at Dodger Stadium on Thursday night. Trailing by two runs, Baltimore had loaded the bases with two outs, with star shortstop [Gunnar Henderson](https://www.mlb.com/player/683002) stepping to the plate to face right-hander Blake Treinen, who had just entered the game. The sellout crowd was loud, as many fans rose to their feet for the most critical juncture of the contest. Henderson struck out, swinging and missing at a high 2-2 cutter from Treinen. The O’s then went down quietly the rest of the way in a [6-3 loss](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/orioles-vs-dodgers/2024/08/29/746102/final/box) to Los Angeles, which took two of three in the series at Chavez Ravine. “It feels playoff atmosphere-ish, as close as you can in the regular season. It’s a really good team over there, with a tough lineup,” manager Brandon Hyde said. “We won one. We had a chance to win in the other two if we string some hits together. We just didn’t do it.” It marked the end of one of the most challenging weeks on the Orioles’ schedule. They previously played four home games vs. the American League West-leading Astros -- earning a split of the series -- and then went on the road to face the MLB-best Dodgers. Although Baltimore (77-58) still didn’t get hot, it survived the grueling stretch by going 3-4. So its deficit to the Yankees in the [AL East](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/standings/?date=2024-08-29) is only 1 1/2 games. Despite the O’s 19-20 record in the second half -- which includes a 12-14 mark in August -- they remain in a good position as the final month of the regular season nears. Their schedule is also about to get quite a bit lighter, as they travel to Colorado to face the Rockies (50-85) before returning home to face the White Sox (MLB-worst 31-104) and the Rays (66-67). “We’re grinding right now. We’ve been grinding for a couple months, honestly,” Hyde said. “The effort that our guys are putting in is fantastic. I think our guys are handling everything really, really well right now. It’s a tough time in the season. We’re also pretty banged up. Looking forward to getting some guys back. “To be competitive against two first-place teams, that’s good. But we want to keep pushing and start doing some things a little bit better.” Some of those things again emerged during the finale loss in Los Angeles. There hasn’t been enough offense, as Baltimore has scored four or fewer runs in five consecutive games and in 10 of its past 12. All three of its runs on Thursday came on one swing -- [Colton Cowser](https://www.mlb.com/player/681297)’s fifth-inning homer (his 20th of his rookie season) that cut the Dodgers’ lead to 5-3. Rookie left-hander [Cade Povich](https://www.mlb.com/player/700249) allowed five earned runs and a career-high 10 hits in his 11th MLB start. He’s given up exactly five runs in each of his two outings since returning from Triple-A Norfolk, recording a 10.80 ERA over that span. “I mean, stuff I looked to improve after coming up, sure, it was fine. Command was still better, only one walk,” Povich said. “But I’ve got to make pitches when it counts.” Even though Povich struggled and the Orioles recorded only four hits, the seventh presented an opportunity for them to orchestrate a comeback win. If Henderson had made contact with Treinen’s final pitch of the inning, it could have changed the game. “Battling our butts off, but it's how the game goes. It sucks, but just how it goes,” said Henderson, who is mired in a 2-for-27 skid. “Probably just need to not try as hard. Taking a lot of swings so just trying to do what I can to help the team. But yeah, just need to probably take it a little bit easier.” Perhaps a weekend trip to hitter-friendly, high-altitude Coors Field is exactly what the O’s need. “Those of us that have been to Colorado and have played the Rockies there, it’s challenging,” Hyde said. “Playing there, it’s just different. It’s video game-ish. It’s so big. The ball travels so much. Balls fall in in the outfield. There’s a lot of things that can happen. No lead is ever too big there. We’re going to go play a young, hungry team that is swinging the bats right now. So we have to play well.”",

    "text": "By Sascha Nixon ,\n1 hour ago\nSource: Thinkstock\nEVANSVILLE, Ind. — A man and woman from Princeton, Indiana – both of whom have criminal records – may soon find themselves in prison again…for stealing mail to the tune of $1 million.\nMichael Wright and Cortney Young have both been charged with mail theft, and they are individually facing charges for crimes such as unlawful possession of a mail key, aggravated identity theft, and more.\nPolice believe Wright used an “arrow key” multiple times to access USPS collection boxes and steal pieces of mail. “Arrow keys” allow Postal Service employees to open collection boxes, mailbox panels, and more.\nAccording to the Department of Justice, police first started getting “complaints” about mail theft and check forgery last October.\nFor at least some of these thefts, Young apparently acted as his getaway driver. Officers say they stopped the two on one such occasion and found stolen wedding invitations, an “arrow key,” and more inside the car.\nLater, in searching Wright and Young’s apartment, police claim they also found stolen checks worth more than $1 million, illegally owned guns, and other items.\nThe post Princeton Couple Arrested for Stealing Mail Worth Over $1 Million appeared first on WIBC 93.1 FM .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Patsoura.\n- \"Vivre comme une personne normale\"- Jusqu'à récemment, quand des prisonniers avaient fini leur peine dans les territoires ukrainiens occupés, ils pouvaient essayer de regagner leur pays via un unique point de passage entre la Russie et l'Ukraine, grâce a l'aide de bénévoles.\nAnna Pritkova, ancienne détenue ukrainienne bloquée dans une prison saisie par les forces russes à Melitopol, le 22 juin 2024 à la gare de Kiev ( AFP / Anatolii Stepanov )\n\"Ils sont jetés (...) à la rue dans leur combinaison de prisonnier\", explique Olga Romanova, qui supervise l'organisation russe de défense des droits des prisonniers \"Rus Sidiachtchaïa\" depuis son exil à Berlin.\nLe point de passage est fermé depuis que les troupes ukrainiennes ont pénétré en Russie le 6 août.\nAprès deux ans dans une prison sous contrôle russe à Melitopol, Anna Pritkova est parvenue à retourner en Ukraine en empruntant le couloir humanitaire alors encore ouvert.\n\"Maintenant, je vais rentrer à la maison pour retrouver mes enfants\", a-t-elle confié à l'AFP un beau jour de juin dans la gare de Kiev. \"Je vais trouver un travail et vivre comme une personne normale\".\nNombreux sont ceux qui espèrent faire de même.\nIoulia, elle, est condamnée à une attente angoissante: Iouri a encore plusieurs années à purger.\n\"C'est vraiment difficile de toujours se demander ce qu'il vit, d'espérer que tout va bien... S'il est encore en vie, s'ils ne l'ont pas tué\".",

    "text": "Governo 'inverte a lógica' ao acusar refinarias privadas de concorrência desleal, diz Refina Brasil\nAssociação que representa fatia de 20% do mercado dominado pela Petrobras e tenta reduzir preço de venda do petróleo bruto pela estatal reage a pedido feito ao Cade e à ANP\nRIO - O presidente da Refina Brasil, Evaristo Pinheiro, divulgou carta na noite de quarta-feira, 14, em resposta ao pedido feito pelo Ministério de Minas e Energia ao Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade) e à Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) de averiguação de supostas práticas anticoncorrenciais das refinarias privadas em suas políticas de preços.\nRepresentante de empresas privadas responsáveis por uma fatia de 20% do refino no País — sendo 14% apenas da Refinaria de Mataripe, na Bahia —, a Refina Brasil afirma que o pedido do MME \"inverte a lógica dos fatos, dado que é a Petrobras o agente dominante no mercado de óleo e gás do Brasil, detendo 93% do mercado de petróleo e 60% do mercado de refino\", afirma.\nA associação tenta há meses reduzir o preço de venda do petróleo bruto da Petrobras para as refinarias privadas, justificando que, com os preços de venda 10% maiores do que para as próprias refinarias da estatal, a competitividade fica comprometida. Além disso, reivindica ajustes no preço de referência divulgado pela ANP.\n\"O ministério ignora os pedidos de correção das distorções regulatórias e concorrenciais extensamente noticiadas e notificadas ao MME, Cade e ANP, como a defasagem do preço de referência do petróleo, a impossibilidade de aquisição de petróleo a preços competitivos, prática de preços predatórios pelo agente dominante do segmento upstream (em reservatórios rochosos), dentre outros\", diz Pinheiro.\nEle ressalta ainda, que o próprio documento enviado pelo MME evidenciou a prática de preços muito inferiores aos patamares de mercado por parte da Petrobras, \"sem que o MME tenha apontado qualquer preocupação de ordem concorrencial em relação a esse fato\", destaca.\n\"A Refina Brasil desde já informa que acompanhará com atenção os desdobramentos dos ofícios, publicará oportunamente seus comentários técnicos aos documentos e adotará todas as medidas cabíveis à defesa de um mercado de refino competitivo, livre e que permita alcançar a autossuficiência em derivados no País\", conclui a carta.",

    "text": "DAMASCO, SIRIA.-La mayoría de las iglesias en Siria restringieron las celebraciones por Navidad y las limitaron a rezos en solidaridad con los palestinos que sufren por la guerra entre [Israel y Hamás ](https://www.elheraldo.hn/fotogalerias/mundo/25-imagenes-mas-impactantes-conflicto-israel-hamas-palestina-LA15732922#image-1)en [Gaza.](https://www.elheraldo.hn/fotogalerias/mundo/franja-de-gaza-cinco-datos-clave-sobre-realidad-marcada-pobreza-conflictos-hamas-palestina-MK15682925#image-1) “La gente está sufriendo en Palestina, lugar de nacimiento de Jesucristo”, dice a la AFP Dionysius Antoine Shahda, el arzobispo católico de Alepo (nordeste de Siria). En la ciudad meridional de Azizia era habitual que pusieran un árbol de Navidad y un mercado navideño, pero este año la plaza central está vacía y no hay las tradicionales decoraciones. “En Siria, hemos cancelado todas las celebraciones y actos en nuestras iglesias en solidaridad con las víctimas de los bombardeos en Gaza” del ejército de Israel, explica Antoine Shahda. Esta decisión de la Iglesia católica siria recibió el respaldo de las instituciones de los ortodoxos griegos y de los ortodoxos sirios (jacobitas), quienes también limitaron sus actos navideños. “Teniendo en cuenta la situación actual, especialmente en Gaza, los patriarcas lo sienten pero no organizarán actos navideños”, aseguraron en un comunicado los responsables religiosos de los católicos, jacobitas y ortodoxos griegos. El Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, gobernada por Hamás, anunció el domingo que los bombardeos e incursiones terrestres de Israel en ese territorio palestino provocaron 20.424 muertos, la mayoría de ellos mujeres y menores, desde el 7 de octubre. Cerca de 1.140 personas murieron en territorio israelí en el ataque sin precedentes de Hamás que desató la ofensiva israelí.La situación en el enclave palestino, asediado completamente por Israel desde el 9 de octubre, es catastrófica. La mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio y la población enfrenta altos niveles de inseguridad alimentaria, según la ONU. “No es el momento para la alegría” Antes del estallido de la guerra civil en Siria en 2011, 1,2 millones de personas de confesión cristiana vivían en ese país de Oriente Medio. Durante ese longevo conflicto, las celebraciones navideñas decayeron, pero se habían recuperado en los últimos años en que los combates perdieron intensidad y el gobierno de Damasco recuperó el control de la mayor parte del territorio. Pero en este mes de diciembre planea un ambiente gris en la capital siria, donde el espíritu navideño se limita a un mercado y la catedral mariamita (ortodoxa) de Damasco puso un pequeño árbol y unas austeras decoraciones. “Este año estamos muy tristes. Empezó con el terremoto y se ha acabado con la guerra de Gaza”, asegura Rachel Haddad, de 66 años, una habitante de Damasco que se refiere al sismo en febrero que dejó un reguero de 55.000 muertos, sobre todo en Turquía y Siria. Además, lamenta la fragilidad de la situación económica en Siria, donde escasea el combustible y suelen producirse cortes de luz. “No hay electricidad. ¿Cómo queréis ver decoraciones y luces en cualquier sitio?”, se pregunta Haddad de manera retórica.",
