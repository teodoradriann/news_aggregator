    "text": "Imagine this: You’ve just launched your dream business. Your products are ready. Your branding looks slick.

Two weeks later, your site is live.\nBut then…\nYour traffic flatlines.\nNo one’s calling.\nCustomers message saying your website “won’t load” or “looks like a scam.” And when you Google your business?

    "title": "Vanessa Ballan, i funerali nel lutto regionale. Il vescovo: \"Serve una civiltà che rifiuti la violenza sulle donne\" - Notizie - Ansa.it",
    "text": "Nel Duomo di Castelfranco Veneto i funerali di Vanessa Ballan, 26 anni, uccisa a coltellate il 19 dicembre. In carcere, accusato dell'omicidio, Bunjar Fandaj, 41 anni. Per il giorno dei funerali il presidente della regione del Veneto Luca Zaia ha proclamato il lutto regionale. \"È troppo grande quanto è accaduto, è troppo al di fuori di ogni pur pessimistica previsione\", ha detto nel duomo il vescovo di Treviso Michele Tomasi nell'omelia. \"Non c'è un motivo al mondo che giustifichi questo atto, questa violenza. Non c'è mai. Non c'è sicuramente nel caso di Vanessa - ha aggiunto - e della creatura che lei portava in grembo\". Per il prelato \"non c'è un senso nella sua brutale uccisione. Questa è il male. E con il male non possiamo, non abbiamo il diritto di venire a patti\". Monsignor Tomasi ha chiesto \"il silenzio dai clamori e dalle curiosità. Silenzio della memoria e delle emozioni più negative. Silenzio della preghiera che invoca la consolazione delle vittime e la conversione dei violenti. Non certo il silenzio della ricerca della giustizia - ha puntualizzato - e nemmeno il silenzio nell'impegno per una civiltà che rifiuti nelle parole, negli atti e nei fatti la violenza sulle donne, e che superi finalmente la follia di voler possedere una persona, o di volerne determinare con la violenza le scelte e le decisioni\". \"Abbiamo tanta rabbia perché non doveva succedere. Non devono più succedere. Io mi chiedo a questo punto a cosa servano le leggi\", ha detto, poco prima dell'inizio del funerale, una collega del supermercato dove lavorava Vanessa Ballan . \"Noi - racconta - avevamo paura quando Fardaj - l'uomo arrestato per l'omicidio, ndr - entrava in negozio, il suo sguardo non mi piaceva\". Bunjar Fandaj, attualmente in carcere a Treviso perché accusato dell'omicidio, avrebbe indirizzato al telefonino del compagno e non alla vittima l'ultima comunicazione via whatsapp, quella che gli è costata la denuncia sporta dalla coppia a fine ottobre. E' quanto emergerebbe dalle indagini dei Carabinieri. Nel messaggio giunto a Nicola Scapinello, Fandaj avrebbe fatto riferimenti espliciti alla natura del rapporto Vanessa, accompagnati anche da un video. Per questo Vanessa e Nicola, di comune accordo, avrebbero preso la decisione di andare insieme dai militari per sporgere querela. La giovane avrebbe raccontato al compagno di aver chiuso la storia con il quarantenne e per questo di essere stata ricattata. Relazioni a Nordio sul perché dei mancati interventi Sono in fase di ultimazione le relazioni che i magistrati della Procura di Treviso invieranno all'Ispettorato del Ministero di Grazie e Giustizia con i motivi per i quali, alla denuncia di Vanessa Ballan nei confronti del suo futuro assassino, Bunjar Fandaj, non fece seguito alcuna misura cautelare. Le relazioni, dei due pm, Valmassoi e Sabattini, e del procuratore capo di Treviso Marco Martani, saranno inviate tramite la Procura Generale di Venezia all'ispettorato del Ministero, e anche come risposta all'interrogazione diretta al ministro Nordio presentata in Senato dal leghista Gian Marco Centinaio. \"Finiremo al ministero nel più breve tempo possibile - ha detto il procuratore Martani, sulla stampa locale - le relazioni dei due pubblici ministeri, quello che era di turno (quando Vanessa presentò la denuncia per stalking, ndr) e quello che fa parte del gruppo speciale per i reati da 'codice rosso'\". Sui mancati provvedimenti cautelari, come il divieto di avvicinamento, il magistrato ha detto che questa valutazione verrà spiegata al Guardasigilli. Il procuratore ha negato che sul caso \"non sia stato fatto niente\", ricordando che fu subito disposta una perquisizione in casa di Bunjar. Ma in assenza dei riscontri sui messaggi intimidatori mandati dall'uomo a Vanessa (Ballan li aveva cancellati dal suo cellulare) la valutazione dei pm sul caso era stata \"di non urgenza\", come aveva ammesso nei giorni scorsi lo stesso Martani.
