    "text": "MISHAWAKA — \"You had the people and now you have the support behind it,\" Penn varsity girls wrestling coach Amy Hildebrandt has been around the sport of wrestling her entire life. And she's thrilled to see her sport on the rise in Indiana, climbing from the club ranks to now in its inaugural season as an IHSAA-sanctioned sport. \"To see it in their eyes and their movement and how empowered they feel, how much they believe and how much they love working hard and being taken seriously and I just freaking love it,\" says Sarah Hildebrandt, the 2024 Paris Olympics gold medalist, as well as a Penn wrestling alum, and Amy's sister. \"It's amazing, but a little scary and nerve-wracking,\" says Janiah Juarez, a senior at Penn who's wrestled for three years. \"It’s still for fun but now it’s a little more serious. You get to say that you placed first at this IHSAA tournament.\" Experiences vary from Juarez, in her 3rd year wrestling, to others who joined the team this year on a whim. \"It’s made me better as a person,\" says senior Lilliah Schlabach, who's in her first season as a wrestler. \"It’s not about being good at this sport, but improving as a person and everything and I love it. Wrestling is a hard sport. A lot of girls are nervous to do it. I was. I think it’s great that we’re getting out there and building the confidence to be able to do that.\" That’s been one goal Penn Head Coach Amy Hildebrandt set out to achieve when she founded the Kingsmen’s girls’ wrestling club as a sophomore in 2011. \"It's elevated the whole sport in my opinion,\" Amy Hildebrandt tells WSBT 22. \"Boys wrestling, men’s wrestling, women’s wrestling, girls wrestling, all of it. It starts here at this level and this involvement. The fact that it’s now open and easily accessible to everyone, that's how you’re going to grow wrestling.\"",

    "text": "A new weather warning is in place for Durham Region. Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement that applies to Ajax, Pickering, Oshawa, Whitby and south Durham, along with Uxbridge, Beaverton and northern Durham, stating that “significant snowfall” is possible on Friday and Friday night (March 22). Hazards for all Durham residents include five to 10 centimetres of snow, with locally higher amounts possible, and reduced visibility in areas of heavier snow, the national weather agency said in its [statement for Durham residents](https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?onrm11=). “Light snow is expected to begin Friday morning, but should intensify late in the afternoon or evening. The snow should taper off from west to east late Friday night,” the statement for Durham reads. “Confidence in exact snowfall amounts at this point is low, although many areas may receive 5 to 10 cm of snow. Note that even higher amounts are possible for areas near Lake Ontario. There is also a risk of freezing rain for areas near Lake Erie Friday evening.” Environment Canada added that the snow “may have a significant impact” on the evening commute on Friday in more urban areas. This weather warning comes in the midst of [several road closures already in place on Highway 401 through Durham](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/all-lanes-closed-significant-highway-401-closures-in-ajax-and-pickering-as-well-as-oshawa/article_ace23d8c-4ace-5ad3-94eb-3ea80fe581ee.html) that, coupled with the snowfall, could wreak serious havoc on roads. This is the [second weather warning](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/environment-canada-puts-ajax-and-pickering-as-well-as-oshawa-whitby-and-rest-of-durham/article_9e9546ed-aec5-55d9-b7bb-b98644df6528.html) of the spring in Durham, and spring is only two days old. The Ontario government, as well as other weather and travel agencies, say that drivers should remember to stay safe during the colder months and be prepared for snowfall at all times, given its unpredictability in certain conditions. You might be interested in Officials say motorists should get a maintenance checkup to ensure that your vehicle is ready for the snow, and also make sure that your gas tank is always half-full. Drivers should also ensure they have an ice scraper and washer fluid in their vehicle at all times.",

    "title": "B.C. odour incidents spark questions around corporate ethics and communication - Prince George Citizen",
    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\" As a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine. \"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said. He immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later. \"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said. It was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches. The smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents. It came just days after a \"controlled release of gas\" from a FortisBC interconnect station in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours. Harvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services. A statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas. Carol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics. \"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said. \"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\" Harvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district. \"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said. Metro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday. But, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different. \"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\" Harvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting. The Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not. \"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said. \"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\" Fortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response. \"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\" Kevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather. \"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\" Parkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility. In a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday. It said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said. The refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations. While some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\" \"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\" Farrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday. \"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said. Metro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\" While some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\" \"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024. Brieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said there was a gas leak at a FortisBC plant.",

    "text": "La météo de Noël dévoilée et c’est une mauvaise nouvelle !\nFanny Jacoble 13 Déc 2024 à 16:33\nIl n’y a pas que la politique qui sera tourmentée cet hiver, la météo aussi et notamment pour Noël. Que nous réserve les 24 et 25 décembre 2024 ? Une chose est certaine, ce n’est pas très engageant. On vous explique grâce aux analyses des experts météo.\n[\n📌 à lire aussi\nLes scientifiques viennent de découvrir une créature marine aussi grande que 2 terrai […]\nLes scientifiques viennent de découvrir une créature marine aussi grande que 2 terrains de basket !\n]https://www.letribunaldunet.fr/insolite/scientifiques-decouvrir-creature-marine-aussi-grande-que-terrains.html?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=block\nHiver 2024-2025 : de plus en plus difficile de faire des prévisions météo\nCroyez-le ou non, mais les prévisions météo ne sont plus tellement « prédites ». En réalité, il est de plus en plus difficile de savoir quel temps et quelles températures il fera pour un certain jour. Et ce, même si c’est un jour futur pas si lointain.\nPrenons un exemple. L’été 2023 fut l’un des plus chauds jamais enregistrés. D’ailleurs, l’automne 2023 fut également l’un des plus chauds, bien au-dessus des normales.\nCela est dû au réchauffement climatique. Le réchauffement climatique a plusieurs effets néfastes, dont celui d’augmenter les périodes de sécheresses et de canicules.\nMais, cet été 2024 fut très différent. Si nous nous attendions à un été encore pire, il n’y a eu que très peu de canicules en France. D’ailleurs, contre toute attente, l’été était plus nuageux que prévu, notamment dans le sud où, habituellement, le soleil frappe fort.\nEt, le réchauffement climatique est également palpable pour cet hiver 2024-2025. Plutôt, dirions-nous : le dérèglement climatique. Car oui, la planète se réchauffe à cause des pollutions, mais la météo se dérègle aussi.\nS’il y a des décennies, nous avions un vrai hiver, un vrai été, un printemps et un automne… aujourd’hui, les saisons se confondent. Et, les événements météorologiques comme les catastrophes naturelles sont aussi de plus en plus fréquentes, même chez nous.\nCe dérèglement climatique et cette imprévisibilité de la météo se vérifie pour la période de Noël 2024. La Chaîne Météo a mis en avant deux scénarios possibles très différents pour le 24 décembre prochain. Cela montre justement que nous ne pouvons plus prévoir le temps avec précision.\n[\n📌 à lire aussi\nLa prédiction de Stephen Hawking sur la fin du monde est-elle sur le point d’arriver […]\nLa prédiction de Stephen Hawking sur la fin du monde est-elle sur le point d’arriver ?\n]https://www.letribunaldunet.fr/science/prediction-stephen-hawking-fin-monde-arriver.html?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=block\nMétéo : Le froid revient, mais pas la neige pour Noël\nNoël 2024 devrait être très loin de ressembler à une fin du monde, avec du vent et de la neige. Deux scénarios se distinguent : soit un Noël froid et humide, soit un Noël doux et calme.\nMais, dans tous les cas, il devrait faire froid sans pour autant aller jusqu’à neiger (sauf peut-être dans les montagnes). S’il a neigé un peu en ce début d’hiver 2024-2025, il est peu probable de passer un Noël sous les flocons et faire des bonhommes de neige en famille.\nDans le premier scénario de La Chaîne Météo, le temps sera plutôt froid et humide pour Noël. « La situation générale serait influencée par l’anticyclone des Açores, assez puissant », explique l’expert.\n« Dans ce contexte, le temps serait assez humide et légèrement plus frais que la normale (entre 1 et 2° C en dessous), même si les précipitations devraient rester faibles dans l’ensemble », lit-on aussi.\nDans ce premier cas, cela voudrait dire que la neige va au moins tomber au niveau des massifs. Par contre, ce ne sera peut-être pas le cas dans le second scénario.\n« Le flux serait faible, et plutôt océanique, ce qui provoquerait beaucoup de nuages sur la moitié nord mais avec de la douceur globalement. Les températures pourraient être supérieures de 2 à 3 °C par rapport à la normale dans ce scénario », explique le site.\n[\n📌 à lire aussi\nVoici la vérité sur les débris « d’un autre monde » capturés par un hélicoptère de la […]\nVoici la vérité sur les débris « d’un autre monde » capturés par un hélicoptère de la NASA sur la planète Mars […]\n]https://www.letribunaldunet.fr/science/verite-debris-autre-monde-captures-helicoptere-nasa-planete-mars.html?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=block\nDe moins en moins d’épisodes neigeux en France\nVous vous souvenez de la dernière fois que vous avez vu de la neige tomber en France ? Nous voulons dire, tomber et rester en place sur la route, empêchant les cars scolaires d’emmener les enfants en cours d’histoire ?\nEn réalité, cela fait des années que la neige peine à revenir dans le pays, justement à cause du réchauffement climatique.\nCe n’est pas pour rien que de nombreuses espèces comme le moustique tigre peuvent vivre chez nous et que certains producteurs font maintenant pousser des avocats et des bananes dans le sud de la France.\nLe temps et la météo changent. Et il est peu probable que la France connaisse encore de gros épisodes neigeux, hormis dans les montagnes ou sous les canons à neige.\nLa météo de ce Noël n’est qu’un exemple. D’après une étude sur la réduction de l’enneigement naturel, la période de neige aurait diminué de 22 à 34 jours dans les Alpes entre 1971 et 2019.\nD’ailleurs, la hauteur de la neige a également baissé. Toujours dans les Alpes, la hauteur de la neige aurait diminué de 2,8 cm par décennie.\n[\n📌 à lire aussi\nUn hybride homme-chimpanzé appelé « Humanzee » a été euthanasié après que les scienti […]\nUn hybride homme-chimpanzé appelé « Humanzee » a été euthanasié après que les scientifiques ont réalisé les co […]\n]https://www.letribunaldunet.fr/science/hybride-homme-chimpanze-humanzee-euthanasie-scientifiques-experience.html?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=block",

    "text": "Who’s watching city hall? Nobody — and that should scare you\nWhere are the journalists?\nIf it seems like the local news you read and watch doesn’t cover the breadth of issues, and doesn’t cover them as well as they used to, you’re not imagining it.\nA new study details a shocking decline in the number of journalists covering local news today, compared to 20 years ago.\nIn 2002, there were an average of 40 local journalists per 100,000 U.S. residents. In 2025, that number fell to 8.2 local journalists per 100,000 residents. That huge drop off means we aren’t getting the coverage of school boards, city councils and boards of supervisors that we used to.\nThe study is a collaboration between two organizations, Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News. Muck Rack is a company that connects public relations professionals with journalists. Rebuild Local News is a non-profit advocating for public policies to strengthen local news coverage around the country.\nThe study has some stunning conclusions.\n• There are 1,000 counties in the United States, fully one-third of all counties, that don’t have one local journalist.\n• The decline doesn’t affect only rural areas. There are significant declines in some of America’s biggest cities, too. The study shows Iowa, although suffering a huge decline in numbers of journalists, is not nearly as bad as many other states.\n• Some of the least-covered areas are fast-growing counties adjacent to big metro areas. That’s true in Iowa, too, which I’ll show below.\nWe’ve been reading for years about layoffs in the news industry, but the study concludes “the data shows that the nation has a shortage of local journalists that is more severe and more widespread than previously thought.”\nSome interesting Iowa numbers:\n• Statewide in 2002, there were 44 journalists per 100,000 residents. Today, that number is 14, less than one-third the number two decades ago. That won’t come as a surprise to anyone running a local newsroom, and it won’t come as a surprise to you, either. We simply don’t get the sustained coverage of local decision-makers like we used to. There are no longer “beat” reporters covering city hall, the school board and the board of supervisors. That results in citizens who aren’t as well-informed as they used to be, particularly when they go to vote. IF they go to vote.\n• Still, Iowa’s 14 journalists per 100,000 residents is enough to rank us 10th best out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It’s not good here, but it’s worse most other places.\n• The Iowa county with the most journalists for its population is Fayette County, up in northeast Iowa with the towns of West Union and Oelwein.\n• The Iowa county in last place with the fewest journalists per residents is Pocahontas County in north-central Iowa.\n• Iowa’s largest county, Polk, which 20 years ago had 297 journalists per 100,000 residents, now has 35 per 100,000.\n• As I mentioned above, fast-growing counties near metro areas have some of the most deficient local news coverage. That’s true for Dallas County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country. It has only 2.9 local journalists per 100,000 residents. Des Moines-based reporters might get to Dallas County, but only for certain kinds of stories. As the study says about these counties in general, “Murders might get covered; school board meetings, don’t hold your breath.”\nWhat’s it mean for you, for journalism, and for America?\nWhat’s it all mean for you, the discerning news consumer? It means you’re not as informed as you used to be. You’re simply not getting the depth of coverage that you used to. It means you must work a little harder to find out what’s really going on in your community. Subscribe to the local paper if you can, watch the news, but also read digital news products like Iowa Capital Dispatch, Axios Des Moines and Substack columns that meet your needs.\nFor an old-school journalist like me, these numbers are depressing. It means there are fewer genuine content providers knocking on doors and digging into documents at city hall. There is way too much repackaging of news that comes from other sources – like those TV news stories I see in Des Moines all the time that come from Cedar Rapids or Sioux City. Those are time-fillers, but don’t really affect the lives of central Iowa viewers.\nWhat’s it all mean for society? To fill the information vacuum, people are forced to get information from social media, where conspiracy theories thrive and misinformation abounds. In my view, this is a major reason why we have too many Americans voting for the truly incompetent people running our country right now. If Americans were better armed with facts, they wouldn’t buy the lies the Trump administration spews 24 hours a day.\nWant to make America great again? We need to hire some real reporters and fix American journalism.\n——-\nDave Busiek spent 43 years working in Iowa radio and television newsrooms as a reporter, anchor and the last 30 years as news director of KCCI-TV",
