    "text": "Early risers: How another hot start propels Indiana women's basketball to a Big Ten win After Sunday’s matchup between [Indiana women’s basketball](/story/sports/college/iu/2024/01/07/indiana-basketballs-xavier-johnson-returns-to-form-in-ohio-state-win/72099563007/) and Nebraska only two teams remain undefeated in Big Ten conference play — Indiana and Iowa. Indiana (13-1) halted Nebraska’s (11-4) perfect conference run with a 91-69 win in Lincoln. It was a team effort with four Hoosiers scoring in double-digits, with the team shooting 61% and dishing 22 assists. “It feels good to come off of a performance like we did at Michigan and then come in here today in a very tough environment and play really good basketball,” said IU head coach Teri Moren. “It feels good for us and our performance, but we also know that this game can be fickle sometimes and so we have to make sure we continue to keep our foot on the pedal.” All-American guard Mackenzie Holmes led the Hoosiers with 22 points, while [Sydney Parrish added 20](/story/sports/college/iu/2024/01/05/sydney-parrish-helps-indiana-womens-basketball-vs-michigan-perfect-first-quarter-teri-moren-big-ten/72110473007/), Sara Scalia 19 and Chloe Moore-McNeil 16.

Since Jan. 4 Parrish is 9-for-11 from 3-point range. Parrish has provided an early offensive cushion for the Hoosiers. In Thursday's win over Michigan Parrish hit five shots as IU was a perfect 13-for-13 in the first period. “Seeing a couple (shots) go down last game against Michigan (helped),\" Parrish said. \"A lot of shooters just need to see one go in and then it will propel you for the next game.\" Parrish finished the game with a new season-high of 20 points. The recent outside scoring surge has also helped create more opportunities down low for Mackenzie Holmes. “This group in particular does a great job of is finding each other and finding each other when they feel like someone has the hot hand,” Moren said. “It’s no mistake that (Parrish) had teammates out there that were trying to feed her and find her.” Mackenzie Holmes vs. Alex Markowski Nebraska center Alexis Markowski up against Holmes provided a physical, old-school Big Ten matchup around the basket. Averaging 17.2 points per game as well as 9.9 rebounds, Markowski challenged Holmes, holding her to eight points in the first half. Markowski also showed her range, canning two from beyond the arc and finishing with 21 points. She picked up her fourth foul early in the third quarter and had to sit, which opened the door for Holmes.

The speed and pressure of the Hoosiers’ defense forced the Huskers into 19 turnovers that Indiana converted into 24 points. “I didn’t like the pace in the first quarter,\" Moren said. \"I thought it was too slow for us.\" Efficient ball movement on the offense opened up Holmes and Parrish, as well as Scalia and Moore-McNeil. Up next for Indiana women Indiana returns home on Wednesday as they host Penn State (10-4, 1-2 in Big Ten). Penn State is the last game before the Hoosiers face the no. 4 Iowa Hawkeyes.",
