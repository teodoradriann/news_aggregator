    "text": "AHMEDABAD, Feb 1: Durham pace duo of Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse wreaked havoc on a depleted India A side as they bowled the hosts out for a modest 192 to give England Lions upper hand in the third and final unofficial Test here on Thursday. At stumps on the opening day of the four-day fixture, England Lions were placed strongly at 98/1, with Alex Lees batting on 48 (106b) in the company of Oliver Price (20; 63b). The visitors trailed by 96 runs in their first innings. Potts returned with excellent figures of 6/57, his second successive six-wicket haul, and now has 18 wickets from three matches. Carse finished with 4/52 from his 12 overs as the duo ensured that the hosts, missing the services of Sarfaraz Khan and Washington Sundar, were bowled out inside two sessions. In response, opener Lees anchored the innings with a composed knock and Keaton Jennings contributed 17 runs before being dismissed by Akash Deep. Price and Lees then put together an unbroken 71-run stand to see through the opening day. For India A, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled a tight spell, but remained wicket-less (8-2-19-0) and he would look to give early breakthroughs to help his team regain control. Leading the three-match series 1-0, the Abhimanyu Easwaran-led side was asked to bat first and faced an early setback when the skipper was trapped in front of the match’s first ball. After his patient approach, Tamil Nadu left-hander shouldered arm an incoming Potts delivery in another horror lbw dismissal, which left India A at 19/2 inside seven overs. Potts continued his onslaught, grabbing Tilak Varma (22) and Rinku Singh who made a second successive duck in his debut India A series. Karnataka batter Devdutt Padikkal emerged as the lone fighter with his 65 (96b) but lacked significant support from his teammates. The England Lions pace duo of Potts and Carse maintained pressure on the Indians, with the latter chipping in with four crucial wickets after the early breakthroughs effected by his colleague. India A, who won the previous unofficial Test by an innings and 16 runs, face a daunting challenge to fight back in this game. Brief scores: India A 1st Innings 192; 50.2 overs (Devdutt Padikkal 65, Saransh Jain 64, Tilak Varma 22; Matthew Potts 6/57, Brydon Carse 4/52). England Lions 1st Innings 98/1; 34 overs (Alex Lees 48 batting, Oliver Price 20 batting). Match to continue. (PTI)",

The mother of four and grandmother of seven was 70 years old and held U.S., Canadian and Israeli citizenship. She was born in Goshen, N.Y., and grew up in Canada, but had lived in Israel for 30 years. Her husband, also a dual Israeli-American citizen, was [confirmed dead last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-gaza-hostage-dead-gadi-haggai/). Both their bodies are believed to still be held by Hamas in Gaza. Weinstein and Haggai were out on a morning walk when Hamas terrorists overran the kibbutz. They took cover in a field where [Weinstein recorded 40 seconds of video](https://apnews.com/article/hostages-israel-hamas-war-what-to-know-406920c384818fa4fe3525327adf3f50) that she shared in a group chat with family. She managed to [inform her loved ones that they had been shot](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-779885) — her husband in the head — but soon lost contact. [Her cellphone signal was later detected in Gaza](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/judih-weinstein-1.7070309), her family told CBC News Network. Their daughter, Iris, told CBS News in November she had seen video evidence [suggesting her father had been killed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-cease-fire-extended-hostage-prisoner-releases/), but until Thursday, she was holding out hope her mother was still alive. Weinstein taught English to special-needs children in Israel, along with meditation and other anti-anxiety techniques to teens and children scared by rocket fire from Gaza. Her husband was a retired jazz musician and chef. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” the family said in a statement. “She will be remembered for her compassion, her peaceful nature, and the creative life she built with her husband.” U.S. officials all the way up to President Biden expressed their sorrow at the news of her death. “Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also [believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/28/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-judith-weinstein/),” Biden said in a statement from the White House. “This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week’s news that Judy’s beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judy and Gad’s four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts.” He vowed anew to work indefatigably to bring the remaining hostages home. New York officials mourned the loss of one of their own. “Heartbroken to learn that Judith (sic) Weinstein was killed during the October 7 attack,” [wrote Gov. Kathy Hochul on X](https://twitter.com/govkathyhochul/status/1740393533641822243). “My heart is with her family abroad and those still here in New York.” U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-Gardiner, who represents the 18th District where Weinstein was born, mourned the “truly devastating” loss. “Our hearts are with Judih and Gadi’s entire family,” [he said on X.](https://twitter.com/RepPatRyanNY/status/1740427647513989404) “The Haggais were teachers, artists, and peace-loving people, killed only for being Jewish. We will continue our fight to bring their bodies home so that they may be properly laid to rest and mourned.” This is truly devastating – our hearts are with Judih and Gadi's entire family. The Haggais were teachers, artists, & peace-loving people, killed only for being Jewish. We will continue our fight to bring their bodies home so that they may be properly laid to rest & mourned. [https://t.co/Lr93NlRh2L] — Rep. Pat Ryan (@RepPatRyanNY) [December 28, 2023] Hamas overran the border from Gaza into Israel on Oct. 7, massacring 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking an estimated 240 hostages.

    "text": "[World ](/world) Workers bedeck Indian town with flowers amid preparations for temple openingModi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims. [bookmark](javascript:;) [Reuters](/author/reuters) Less than a month before a grand Hindu temple opens, India's northern town of Ayodhya is buzzing with activity as finishing touches are put on a project seen as the centrepiece of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's re-election campaign. Once a sleepy temple town in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya has received a new airport and roads in a $6-billion facelift as Modi prepares to inaugurate the temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities. A day before Modi was set to inaugurate the airport and a renovated train station, workers decorated the streets with flowers, amid a swarm of police. \"Soon our Lord will be in his original place,\" said Girish Sahastrabhojane, who worked on the design of the temple, which forms part of a sprawling 70-acre (28-hectare) complex of carved pink sandstone and white marble. \"Our Lord Ram was born here and the Hindus of India, and also abroad, have been waiting for it since 1992,\" the engineer involved in the construction told visiting reporters. But Modi's opponents have accused him of stoking religious sentiment to further his political ambitions, and several opposition leaders have declined an invitation to attend the temple's inauguration. On Jan 22, Modi will pray for the first time before an idol of Lord Ram at the project, which cost more than 20 billion rupees ($240 million), and where more than 4,500 workers are labouring round the clock to complete the ground floor. Wearing hardhats and safety shoes, they worked on Friday to carve pillars and lift stones amid cranes towering over the site, which Sahastrabhojane said could accommodate 125,000 people in a day. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims. He has made its construction an emotive issue in many speeches ahead of next year’s general elections, widely expected to secure him a third term. Nationwide riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them minority Muslims, broke out in 1992 after a Hindu mob razed the Babri mosque - where the temple will stand - saying it was built on the site of an earlier Hindu temple. In 2019, the Supreme Court ordered that Hindus be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.",

She will be dearly missed.”\nEnglish singer and actress Marianne Faithfull in March 1965 with her then-fiancé, British artist John Dunbar. Getty Images Faithfull was known for a slew of hits, including “As Tears Go By,” which was written by the Rolling Stones ‘ Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, with whom she had a several-year romance.\nThe song reached the UK Top 10 in 1964.\nFaithfull played herself in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1966 movie “Made in the USA,” starring Anna Karina, and made her debut onstage co-starring in Chekov’s “Three Sisters” with Glenda Jackson.

Pascal Le Segretain After her addiction to cocaine and heroin worsened, she was found naked, wrapped in a fur rug, during a 1967 police search of Richards’ home, alongside the guitarist, Jagger and six other men, according to the Guardian .\n“It destroyed me,” Faithfull later said, per the outlet. “To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorizing. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.”\nIn the early ’70s, Faithfull lost custody of her son, broke up with Jagger and became homeless.\nShe lived on the streets of Soho in London as she tried to quit drugs. “I’d been living in a very fake sort of world in the ’60s,” she said in 2016. “Suddenly, when I was living on the streets … I realized that human beings were really good. The Chinese restaurant let me wash my clothes there. The man who had the tea stall gave me cups of tea.”\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nEnglish singer Marianne Faithfull poses on the set of the Rolling Stones concert film “Rock and Roll Circus” at Intertel Studio in London in 1968.

    "title": "Gli Usa preparano la rappresaglia anti-Iran: «Pronti a colpire in Siria e Iraq». E Biden firma le sanzioni contro i coloni israeliani - Open",
    "text": "Gli Stati Uniti si preparano a lanciare una serie di attacchi contro obiettivi iraniani in Siria e in Iraq. Questo per lo meno è quanto indicano indiscrezioni della [Cbs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-personnel-facilities-in-iraq-syria-approved-jordan-drone-attack/), a cui funzionari della Casa Bianca hanno confermato che i piani per condurre gli strike di rappresaglia sono stati approvati. «Gli Usa non tollerano attacchi alle proprie truppe. Prenderemo tutte le misure necessarie a difendere gli Stati Uniti, i nostri interessi e il nostro popolo», ha detto in conferenza stampa il segretario alla Difesa Lloyd Austin, aggiungendo che «risponderemo dove, quando e come sceglieremo». La promessa arriva a pochi giorni dall’ [attacco](https://www.open.online/2024/01/28/giordania-raid-droni-soldati-usa-biden-iran) con droni a una base americana sul confine tra Siria e Giordania in cui sono rimasti uccisi tre soldati statunitensi. Sembra escluso comunque ogni progetto di rivalsa diretta contro l’Iran. «Non è quello che sto cercando», ha detto il presidente [Joe Biden](https://www.open.online/temi/joe-biden/) nei giorni scorsi a chi gli chiedeva se si potesse aprire un confronto militare diretto tra Washington e Teheran, accusato di muovere come pedine le sue milizie nella regione in chiave anti-Usa e Israele. Sanzioni ai coloni: il segnale Usa a Netanyahu Nelle stesse ore la Casa Bianca ha preso un’altra decisione preannunciata da tempo che ha a che fare col conflitto in Medio Oriente. Obiettivo però questa volta Israele. O meglio, una sua porzione di popolazione ben precisa. Joe Biden ha infatti firmato oggi un ordine esecutivo che impone sanzioni finanziarie e il blocco del visto a quattro coloni israeliani in Cisgiordania che hanno attaccato negli scorsi mesi i palestinesi: con atti di violenza, nonché minacce e tentativi di distruggere o impossessarsi di loro proprietà, precisa la Casa Bianca. Che rende esplicito come quello di oggi voglia essere un segnale politico anche al governo di ultradestra guidato da [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.open.online/temi/benjamin-netanyahu/): «una risposta diretta al drammatico aumento delle violenze dei coloni» contro i palestinesi in Cisgiordania dopo l’attacco di Hamas del 7 ottobre, ha precisato il portavoce del consiglio di sicurezza nazionale Usa John Kirby. Il livello di violenza dei coloni, ha aggiunto lo stesso Biden, è ormai diventato «intollerabile» e costituisce «una seria minaccia per la pace, la stabilità e la sicurezza» di tutta la regione. Una decisione quella della Casa Bianca accolta ovviamente con amarezza a Gerusalemme: «Non c’è motivo di adottare misure straordinarie. La maggioranza assoluta dei residenti in Giudea-Samaria (Cisgiordania) sono cittadini rispettosi della legge», ha detto Netanyahu, sottolineando come Israele «già opera contro chi infrange la legge» e come peraltro in questo periodo «i residenti della regione sono impegnati nella difesa di Israele sia nelle unità di leva sia fra i riservisti». Spiragli di tregua Nel frattempo prosegue dietro le quinte il lavorio per arrivare a un difficilissimo accordo tra Israele e Hamas per mettere fine, almeno temporanea, ai combattimenti. Fonti del governo del Qatar hanno detto nelle scorse ore a Reuters che Hamas avrebbe accolto «positivamente» la [bozza d’intesa](https://www.open.online/2024/01/30/guerra-israele-hamas-30-gen) predisposta nei giorni scorsi dai mediatori, anche se una risposta formale ancora non è pervenuta. «La stiamo aspettando», premono dal Qatar: su Hamas, ma implicitamente anche su Israele.

    "title": "Global scientific network highlights plant genera named for women",
    "text": "A network of scientists across the globe have identified more than 700 plant genera named for women. This is a nearly twenty-fold increase in the number of genera linked to women before the group started working on the list.\nThe project, which aimed to highlight the contribution of women to botany, was the result of social media conversations about plants named for people.\nWhat began as a simple question about how many and which plant genera were named for women evolved into a global network of scientists who built a dataset of plant genera named in honor of women. The group, which met virtually for over two years, also worked to improve data easily available about these genera that have information publicly available through the global resource Wikidata.\nThe results, which included a dataset of 728 plant genera named for women and female beings (mythological), were recently published in a paper entitled, “Creating a multi-linked dynamic dataset: a case study of plant genera named for women.”\n“Our motivation for this research was not only to highlight the names of plant genera named after women, but to look at the roles and lives of these women, many with fascinating stories, and to better recognize the contribution to science of this historically marginalized group,” said Missouri Botanical Garden Curator Dr. Carmen Ulloa.\nUlloa is one of eight co-authors of the paper that represents a multidisciplinary group of female experts from around the world with an interest in diversity and inclusion in science. Other authors involved in this research are from the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, the Cambridge University Herbarium, and from Wellington, New Zealand.\nHistorically, women were often excluded from scientific professions, the paper explains, and one way that is plainly visible is in eponymy, or the practice of naming taxa for people. Like streets, monuments, and parks, plant names at all levels – species, genus, family, etc. – can be named for people. The group specifically focused on the names of flowering plant genera, as there are roughly 16,000 known genera compared to 450,000 known plant species.\nThe group deliberately did not compare the number of names honoring women to those named for men with the intention of amplifying women’s contributions to the history and development of science. Their research found that many of the contributions of women honored were in unpaid roles, such as a supportive spouse, or obscured among a collection team and “whose role in the discovery of a new plant genus has been historically overlooked,” explained Ulloa.\nIt also created a dataset that can be used by other researchers looking to build upon the work. The team deliberately used a push-pull method so that existing resources were constantly updated in an Open Science approach as work proceeded.\n“Taking this Open Science approach has ensured we have amplified the contribution of women to the field of botany,” the paper explains. “We hope to inspire others to use our methods and workflows to empower their own research and follow-up studies on under-represented and under-acknowledged groups in science.”\n# # #\nThe Missouri Botanical Garden’s mission is “to discover and share knowledge about plants and their environment in order to preserve and enrich life.” Today, 165 years after opening, the Missouri Botanical Garden is a National Historic Landmark and a center for science, conservation, education and horticultural display.\nJournal\nBiodiversity Data Journal\nMethod of Research\nContent analysis\nArticle Title\nCreating a multi-linked dynamic dataset: a case study of plant genera named for women\nArticle Publication Date\n6-Dec-2023",
