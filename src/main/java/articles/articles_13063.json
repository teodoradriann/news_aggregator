    "title": "Polis headed for another showdown with Democrats over union issues - The Journal",
    "text": "Gov. Jared Polis is once again on a collision course with fellow Democrats in the state Legislature and the Colorado labor movement.\nThe governor quickly pooh-poohed a piece of legislation unveiled earlier this month that unions say will be their priority when state lawmakers reconvene at the Capitol in January. The bill has the backing of top legislative Democrats, as well as the chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party.\nThe divide is likely to inflame tensions that flared when Polis vetoed three of the labor movement’s bills passed during the 2024 legislative session. During a May protest on the steps of the Capitol, hundreds of demonstrators, flanked by some of the most prominent Democrats in the state, shouted “Shame on Polis!” Some wore “Polis failed workers” T-shirts as they gathered under a banner that said “Governor Polis turned his back on us.”\nAhead of next year’s legislative session, unions are starting their pressure campaign on the governor early. And they are deploying their most influential supporters.\n“I’m very proud to be here with all these Democrats – our brothers and sisters in labor – to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is,” Colorado Democratic Party Chairman Shad Murib said during a Nov. 19 labor rally in the foyer outside Polis’ office at the state Capitol.\nHe was the closing speaker at the event, emphasizing a point made by other speakers.\n“This is where we get a chance to put up or shut up,” state Rep. Javier Mabrey, D-Denver, said at the rally. “Which side are you on, Colorado Democrats? The power is completely in our hands.”\nThe rally was held to unveil a bill that will be introduced during the legislative session that would make it easier for unions to organize in Colorado.\nThe bill would eliminate a barrier before unions and employers can negotiate whether all employees should have to pay representation fees to the union, whether they are part of the union or not. That’s known as union security. Right now, those union security negotiations can only happen after a vote of employees, and it requires as much as 75% of eligible workers’ support to pass.\nThat vote is in addition to the simple majority vote required to form a union in the first place. The requirement is unique to Colorado and is part of the Labor Peace Act, a 1943 state law.\nUnion supporters say the second-vote requirement is an unfair burden for workers who want to collectively bargain.\n“That 75% turnout is insane,” Alejo R. González, political and community coordinator at Service Employees International Union Local 105 in Denver, told The Colorado Sun earlier this year. “It’s hard to get that many people to vote. … And a lot of companies won’t start bargaining until that happens.”\nA Sun analysis found that about half of the second-vote elections since the late 1970s have failed.\n“Colorado’s required second election is too much, and it’s not right,” Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez of Denver, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said at the Nov. 19 rally.\nRodriguez said his bill rolling back the requirement will be introduced during the first week of Colorado’s 2025 legislative session, which begins Jan. 9.\nThe business community is already chafing at the proposed changes to Colorado’s labor laws.\n“The Labor Peace Act has been a cornerstone of Colorado’s economic success for decades,” J. J. Ament, president and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, said in a written statement. “To unravel this proven compromise now, while our economy is still recovering, is reckless. This isn’t just bad for businesses – it’s bad for Coloradans. Forcing employees to pay into unions increases costs for workers already struggling to make ends meet.”\nDaniel Ryley, vice president of economic competitiveness at the chamber, said the first question businesses looking to relocate to Colorado ask is about the state’s so-called right-to-work status.\nIn right-to-work states, employees never have to join a union or pay union fees as a condition of their employment. Colorado isn’t a right-to-work state, but the second-vote barrier makes it more difficult for unions to require that employees pay for representation whether they are part of the union or not.\n“Between 2018 and 2023, Colorado’s average annual employment growth rate of 1.5% was more than three times that of non-right-to-work states,” he said in a statement. “At its core, the Labor Peace Act supports a thriving environment where businesses, employees and communities can succeed together.”\nAssuming the union security bill passes the Legislature, Polis will once again be caught between the wishes of his party and his free-market leanings. The governor expressed early skepticism of the measure in a statement released by his office.\nPolis “is leery of the need for a new bill to open the Labor Peace Act that serves the state and workers so well,” said Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for the governor. She noted that Colorado’s labor laws “go further than those of the 26 right-to-work states by not only protecting the right to organize, but also providing an avenue to strengthen unions through union-security agreements.”\n“Any changes to the Labor Peace Act would need to find common ground with employers and businesses and labor, and the governor is deeply skeptical of this bill without a heavily negotiated, thoughtful and comprehensive process,” she added.\nIt’s unclear which of the bills Polis vetoed this year may return in 2025. They were:\n- House Bill 1008, which would have created new wage theft protections for construction workers, making general contractors liable for wages owed by their subcontractors. Polis argued it would have let subcontractors off the hook for bad behavior, and increased the cost of construction by passing the financial burden on to general contractors.\n- House Bill 1307, which would have prohibited school districts from using federal money to hire HVAC contractors who aren’t certified by the state Department of Labor and Employment. Polis said it would have made it harder for rural schools to apply for grants, noting in his veto letter that more than a dozen counties lack state-certified electrical or plumbing contractors in their area. He also told The Sun he would have signed it if lawmakers had agreed to provide waivers to schools that made good-faith efforts to meet the new standards.\n- House Bill 1260, which would have prohibited employers from disciplining workers who refuse to attend an employer-sponsored meeting that involves religious or political matters, with some exceptions. Polis said the bill was so broad it would have created a chilling effect on free speech and could have limited even businesses’ basic operational functions and work meetings.\nHouse Bill 1307 was time-sensitive and tied to federal dollars. Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board recently ruled that companies cannot force workers to attend meetings where employers express their views on unionization, making House Bill 1260 less relevant.\nNegotiations around bringing back House Bill 1008 in a way that could win Polis’ approval are underway.\n“We did meet with the governor and the governor’s team over the summer. We talked about a few things – seeing where we could possibly work with the governor’s team,” said Mark Thompson, senior representative for the Western States Regional Council of Carpenters.\nThompson said, however, that the two sides are “not on the same page.”\n“This coming session, we’re not going to push a contractor liability piece,” he said. “We’re not going to go there.”\nA wage-theft bill is still coming, Thompson said. But it would only allow workers who are victims of wage theft to file larger claims with the state.\n[The Colorado Sun is a reader-supported, nonpartisan news organization dedicated to covering Colorado issues.

    "text": "勞保局統計，從1986年至2024年為止，墊償基金累積已墊償82億9547萬餘元，但僅追回16億3711萬餘元，追償率不到2成。（本報資料照片）　許多雇主經營不善時，往往會積欠勞工工資、退休金或資遣費，為保障勞工，《勞動基準法》訂定積欠工資墊償基金制度，當雇主發生歇業、清算或宣告破產時，勞保局將墊付並向雇主追討，據統計，截至2024年仍有超過66億元未追回，追償率不到2成。勞保局強調，將積極維護債權。　勞保局統計，從1986年至2024年為止，墊償基金累積已墊償82億9547萬餘元，但僅追回16億3711萬餘元，追償率不到2成。勞保局普通給付組長劉秀玲坦言，公司會積欠勞工薪資，並且走到清算、歇業時往往已經經營不善，沒有現金流，因此追償難度相對高，但2016年勞基法修正把勞工薪資列為第一順位抵押權後，目前追償率已大幅增加，近幾年追償率已達26％。　隨《勞動基準法》及《勞動基準法施行細則》於2015年修正，將積欠工資墊償基金墊償範圍擴大，增加實際墊償金額及財務壓力，該基金累積未償金額快速增加，且逐年墊償金額大於償還金額。　近幾年如華映清算後墊償8億餘元、遠東航空墊償2.9億元等案件，近年也積極追討，如在遠東航空停業後已討回2.8億元。截至2024年年底，墊償基金餘額達196億元。　為增加追償比率，劉秀玲說，由於墊償後向雇主追償為循民事法院程序，過程相對較長，為加速處理程序，勞保局會在墊付後就函請事業單位於7日內償還墊款，只要經法院審理後取得債權會定期查調事業單位財產狀況，若有可供執行財產，會積極聲請強制執行，如果事業單位曾有勞退舊制勞工，還會請地方政府召開勞工退休準備金請求人會議盡速結清，以利後續追償。　全國產業總工會理事長戴國榮說，目前墊償基金墊償後僅能向事業單位追討，無法向負責人追討，若有事業單位惡意倒閉，政府恐怕難以討回，應要研議透過修法或其他方式補強，而不是企業倒閉後負責人就沒事。",

    "title": "Revealed: The Reason Behind Hoda Kotb & Joel Schiffman’s Split",
    "text": "Jamie Mccarthy/Getty Images Hoda Kotb and Joel Schiffman looked like one of those couples that would ride off into the sunset — until they didn’t. After nearly a decade together and two kids, they pulled the plug before ever getting to say “I do.” But if you’re expecting some juicy scandal behind their split, don’t hold your breath.\nThe “Today” host had long believed that Schiffman was the man she’d grow old with. Sure, it took six years to get a ring on her finger, but marriage was always on the agenda. And when he finally popped the question, she was over the moon. “I actually didn’t know I could love him more, but I did, in that moment. And I’ve felt different ever since,” she once gushed in a “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” appearance. They were supposed to have a low-key beach wedding in August 2020, but due to the pandemic, all plans were put on ice. By January 2022, they’d announced they were better off as friends and co-parents than future spouses. Kotb even cleared the air on “Today,” saying, “It’s not like something happened … They say sometimes relationships are meant to be there for a reason, for a season, or for a lifetime, and I feel like ours was meant to be there for a season.”\nIt wasn’t until two years after their split that Kotb shared a little more insight about their parting of ways. Turns out, the real reason they called it quits was simply a case of life taking them in different directions.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images Even though Hoda Kotb and Joel Schiffman called off their engagement, Kotb still holds her ex-fiancé in the highest regard. She continues to think the world of him — it’s just that their life goals veered off in different directions, leading to their split.\n“Joel is one of the best people I know, and he really is a great human being,” Kotb dished in a “The Jamie Kern Lima Show” episode. “And I feel like I’m a pretty great human being, but sometimes two great human beings together isn’t quite enough to make it work.” She went on to explain that their growth didn’t align, making it tough for them to see eye to eye. “When people are growing at different paces, it’s hard to be in sync,” she explained. “One person wants it this way, and one person wants it that way.” Still, Kotb has zero regrets about their almost-decade together, especially since Schiffman helped her adopt their daughters, Haley Joy and Hope Catherine. “It’s because of Joel that I have Haley and Hope, without question,” she told People. “I think I might have been too afraid to do it alone. That’s not something I love to admit, but it’s true.”\nAnd now, they’re able to create a co-parenting setup, and it’s working out rather swimmingly. “He’ll have a Saturday, and I’ll do the Sunday. We switch each week. He’ll take the girls and do some fun things, and I’ll take some quiet time,” she shared. “It’s a healthy mix, and the kids love it. He’s a great dad.”\nJohn Nacion/Getty Images Even though Hoda Kotb found herself single in her fifties, she didn’t lose a wink of sleep worrying about her dating prospects. With a rock-solid sense of self, she’s confident that the right person will eventually come along. “I’ve had past loves, and I feel like I’ll have future loves,” she said in her People interview. “Once you know who you are all the way, then love can come in. You know how people say the older you get, the more you know who you are? I think someone who meets me now will meet me for real.”\nBut don’t think Kotb’s letting just anyone waltz into her life. These days, she’s playing it smart, refusing to bend over backward to please someone else. On “The Drew Barrymore Show,” she revealed that while she’s having a blast in the dating world, she’s not about to settle. “I’ve gotten to a point where if the date’s not formulating, and it’s OK, I’ll say, ‘Oh my God, this was so much fun — you’re a really nice guy.’ I don’t mind being myself and being confident and knowing what I want,” she said, noting that she has since learned how to draw the line. “I’m not twisting myself in a pretzel to make everybody feel good all the time because I’ve done that for most of my life, and it was exhausting.” We’re totally here for this single Hoda era!\nSource: Nicki Swift",
