    "title": "How Biden Can Tackle Mass Incarceration – DNyuz",
    "text": "As a candidate, Joe Biden said he would substantially reduce the federal prison population as president. Last week he commuted the sentences of 11 people who he said were serving unjustifiably harsh prison terms for drug offenses and also pardoned people convicted of certain marijuana charges. Still, the number of people in federal prison has grown during the Biden administration.\nDespite historical bipartisan support for sentencing reform, Mr. Biden has failed to fully embrace the momentum of his two immediate predecessors, who made substantial efforts to tackle mass incarceration. Some have argued that his relative inaction on the issue may hurt him among key voting groups.\nBut it is not too late.\nTen years ago, Barack Obama began an ambitious program to reform the country’s criminal justice system and take on mass incarceration, offering clemency to people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes who had demonstrated rehabilitation. Over 1,500 people were freed — many of whom would have died in prison otherwise.\nAnd five years ago, Donald Trump took up that mantle and accelerated reform of federal sentencing laws by championing the First Step Act , which, as of January 2023, has resulted in the early release of nearly 30,000 people in prison, including many sentenced under what many lawmakers came to consider especially harsh laws.\nThe opportunity is ripe for Mr. Biden to act as well. And he can do so without negotiating with a fractious Congress and without following Mr. Obama’s politically fraught path of offering clemency, which invites the same arbitrariness and inequities that reformers are trying to correct.\nInstead, Mr. Biden can chart his own course by taking advantage of a little-used law that allows prison officials to recommend to federal judges that they re-evaluate sentences of people for “extraordinary and compelling reasons.” This can include people who are facing long sentences and have already served many years behind bars, have shown their commitment to rehabilitation and are prepared for release.\nThis approach, which could be called administrative clemency, is fairer, more transparent, more comprehensive and less politically complicated than traditional clemency. It is in step with reforms percolating through state legislatures that empower law enforcement agencies and judges to revisit old, unnecessarily harsh prison sentences. It also encourages people in prison to work on themselves through education, vocational training, counseling and drug treatment.\nPrison officials are ideally situated to make this evaluation. Prosecutors, judges, police and even defense lawyers tend to move on to other cases and often do not keep tabs on people sent to prison who have been working to rehabilitate themselves and are hoping for some kind of reprieve. But prison officials and staff members work with them daily and follow and chart their progress.\nThe administrative clemency process empowers prison officials to identify suitable candidates for resentencing based on their behavior and rehabilitation. Those cases would be sent back to court, where a judge would make the final determination on whether a person’s sentence should be reduced.\nUnlike clemency, this decision is made in open court, with arguments and evidence by prosecutors and defense lawyers. It also allows courts to consider and impose release plans that maximize public safety. Final determinations are made by federal judges with lifetime tenure who are distant from the politics that influence presidential-level decisions. In short, this process returns the case to where it belongs: in court, with all the legal protections, evidence and consideration criminal cases deserve.\nWhile some people may be justifiably wary of investing so much power in prison officials, a similar process is working in California, infamous for having some of the country’s harshest sentencing laws and most overcrowded prisons, as well as what may be the nation’s most powerful prison guard lobby.\nOver the past six years, under a program begun by Jerry Brown when he was governor, California state prison officials have recommended 2,200 people for sentencing reductions. Before any candidates are released, they undergo thorough vetting by prosecutors and defense lawyers, and a judge determines whether continued incarceration is no longer in the interest of justice.\nThere is little litigation because after a person is identified and endorsed by prison officials, it becomes clear that the sentence is unnecessarily long and counterproductive. California’s program makes use of what had been a largely dormant state statute similar to the federal law that Mr. Biden could employ.\nMr. Obama, who recognized that many criminal punishments were overly harsh, ineffective at maintaining public safety and infected by racial bias, argued in a Harvard Law Review article that presidents have an “obligation” to correct injustices baked into the county’s criminal legal system. “How we treat citizens who make mistakes (even serious mistakes), pay their debt to society and deserve a second chance reflects who we are as a people,” he wrote.\nAnd Mr. Trump, in social media posts after Congress passed substantial changes to tough-on-crime laws in 2018, said that it was his job “to fight for all citizens, even those who have made mistakes” and added that the new law would “keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it.” Among other things, the changes reduced prison terms.\nAdministrative clemency, if the Biden administration pursues it, will not correct fundamental flaws in the criminal legal system. It will not directly address racism, mental illness and bad social science that can be corrected only through comprehensive reform. But it is something Mr. Biden can do to address thousands of unfair federal sentences without embroiling himself in the politics of clemency or legislation. And it’s something he can do today.\nThe post How Biden Can Tackle Mass Incarceration appeared first on New York Times .",

Eso [Xiaomi ](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/09/24/versatilidad-a-toda-prueba-asi-es-la-nueva-redmi-pad-se-de-xiaomi/)lo sabe bien, ya que en los últimos años ha estado innovando con todo tipo de aparatos electrónicos. Tal es el caso de su nuevo SU7, un vehículo eléctrico con el que planean entrar a lo grande al negocio automotriz. Y es que la revelación de este automóvil marca un hito significativo en la estrategia de la empresa, que aspira a ser uno de los cinco principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo en los próximos 15 a 20 años. Un vehículo ambicioso: Así es el Xiaomi SU7 Según [Xiaomi](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336), el SU7 no es sólo un vehículo, sino que se define como una extensión del ecosistema tecnológico de la firma. De partida, incorpora el sistema operativo [HyperOS](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/10/26/xiaomi-14-presentada-la-nueva-linea-de-la-marca-con-pantallas-de-3000-nits-y-camaras-de-apertura-variable/), diseñado para integrarse perfectamente con una amplia gama de dispositivos Xiaomi, incluidos IoT, televisores, altavoces, y más. Este sistema operativo es el cerebro detrás del SU7, capaz de gestionar tanto los sistemas de info-entretenimiento como la conducción autónoma. El SU7, también denominado “Speed Ultra”, estará disponible en dos versiones; la primera con el motor HyperEngine V6 y la otra con un HyperEngine V6S, que ofrecen potencias impresionantes de 295 CV y 663 CV respectivamente. Su autonomía, en tanto, varía entre 1.000 y 1.200 kilómetros, dependiendo de la batería seleccionada. HyperOS: Más que un sistema operativo Sin dudas el lanzamiento de HyperOS representa un gran avance, tanto en términos de vehículos eléctricos como también en la integración de la tecnología en la vida cotidiana. Este sistema operativo permite una conexión instantánea con otros aparatos, permitiendo acceder y controlar aplicaciones móviles directamente desde el sistema del SU7. Con una pantalla de 16,1 pulgadas y resolución 3K, HyperOS también permite la visualización de parámetros de conducción y la gestión de otros dispositivos conectados. Xiaomi contra Tesla: ¿Una competencia real? Por supuesto que Xiaomi no compite solo, ya que la compañía se enfrenta a un mercado de vehículos eléctricos dominado directamente por [ Tesla](https://www.fayerwayer.com/entretenimiento/2023/12/03/el-cybertruck-de-tesla-ya-esta-aqui-conoce-su-precio/). Así que tras el lanzamiento del SU7, Xiaomi entrará en este mercado y, según su [comunicado](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336) oficial, intentará reinventarlo gracias a su amplia gama de tecnologías. El tiempo dirá si el SU7 logra establecerse como un serio competidor de Tesla y si logrará su objetivo de ser uno de los principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo. Por ahora, estaremos atentos a su fecha de lanzamiento para contarles todos los detalles oportunamente.",

    "text": "Iconic household brand, Capri-Sun, has launched one of its biggest ever integrated marketing campaigns – bringing the taste of fun to consumers across the UK.\nWith a combined estimated reach of over 400+ million, the 360 integrated marketing campaign represents a significant brand investment and will see Capri-Sun spotlight its new Zero added sugar range. Introducing the new product innovation – the brand´s lowest sugar product to date – the campaign invites consumers to embrace playful fun and carefree moments, one sip at a time.\nThe campaign, created in partnership with leading digital marketing agency, iProspect, forms part of Capri-Sun’s continued investment in driving greater brand awareness and trial and injecting fun into the kid’s juice drinks category, with a 60% year-on-year increase.\nCommenting on the campaign, Anke von Hanstein, Senior Marketing Manager Capri-Sun UK, said: “We know parents lead busy lives and are looking for simplicity in their choices, especially when it comes to their children’s drinks. Capri-Sun Zero added sugar offers a product they know their kids will love, without any of the guilt or having to check the label for sugar. Our new marketing campaign captures the carefree fun and great taste our Zero range offers with every sip. It also marks a significant investment in the brand, as we focus on increasing market share by driving mass awareness and trial among UK consumers.”\nCommenting on 2024, James Bailey, CEO iProspect UK, said: “Capri Sun and iProspect have a longstanding relationship. Our work has delivered outstanding results in the past and opened up some brilliant innovations media. 2024 will be the most exciting year yet. With new products, a renewed focus and some big ambitions. Watch this space.”\nThe campaign will run from April to September, targeting families with activity across CTV, video-on-demand, YouTube, digital and social channels. It will also be supported by out-of-home activity, which will see it reach consumers nationwide with an OOH takeover.\nThe Zero added sugar range is sold across UK grocery and wholesale channels. Tapping into the growing demand for low-and-no sugar drinks options, the product has been developed to offer consumers more choice with a reduced sugar option without compromising on the iconic Capri-Sun taste.",
