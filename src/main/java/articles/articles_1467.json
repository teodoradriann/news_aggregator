    "title": "“Se desaconseja viajar”: La advertencia de la NWS para el fin de semana en California",
    "text": "El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional ha emitido una advertencia crucial para los residentes y viajeros en California este fin de semana. Se insta encarecidamente a evitar los viajes hacia y desde la Sierra Nevada debido a la llegada prevista de una tormenta invernal. Las condiciones extremas están pronosticadas para afectar una amplia área, incluidos importantes corredores como la Interestatal 80 y la Carretera 50, las dos carreteras principales que entran y salen de Tahoe Basin. \"Se desaconseja encarecidamente viajar\", señaló el NWS, en un alerta que destaca la gravedad del clima que se espera, con fuertes nevadas y condiciones peligrosas que podrían hacer que los viajes sean difíciles, si no imposibles. La seguridad pública es primordial en momentos como este, y se recomienda encarecidamente a todos tomar precauciones y seguir de cerca las actualizaciones meteorológicas. El pronóstico para la región indica que las nevadas intensas, con acumulaciones de hasta 1 a 3 pies de nieve fresca, podrían provocar cierres de carreteras, retrasos significativos y condiciones peligrosas para quienes se aventuren en las carreteras. En las áreas de recreación al aire libre, como la Cuenca Tahoe y el Parque Nacional Yosemite, que suelen ser destinos populares durante los fines de semana, se espera que las condiciones climáticas extremas afecten las actividades recreativas. Las intensas nevadas y las condiciones de viento adversas podrían interrumpir o incluso suspender actividades como el esquí, el snowboard y las caminatas. Se prevé que los acumulados de nieve sean particularmente altos en elevaciones más altas, con pronósticos que alcanzan hasta 2 a 3 pies en áreas como el Parque Nacional Yosemite. La advertencia de tormenta invernal rige desde las 17 horas local del viernes hasta el mismo horario del domingo. Esta situación hace imperativo que los residentes y los turistas estén al tanto de las actualizaciones meteorológicas y sigan las recomendaciones de seguridad emitidas por las autoridades pertinentes para garantizar su bienestar durante esta tormenta invernal pronosticada.",

    "text": "It’s been a rainy day at Walt Disney World. With such poor weather, there weren’t many guests at Magic Kingdom, and only one security line has been operating at the Transportation and Ticket Center. This is where most guests go through security screening before entering the park. Unfortunately, as the rain has subsided, crowds of guests have arrived but only one line remains open.\nTransportation and Ticket Center Security Line\nWhen we were leaving the Transportation and Ticket Center between 1:00 p.m. and 1:20 p.m., the security line stretched under the bridge and into the disability parking lot.\nGuests who took a tram from their car were being dropped off close to the security station but then had to walk back to the end of this line.\nA Cast Member told us that there was a fire code in one of the parking lots that pulled several security officers away from the Transportation and Ticket Center.\nGuests rushing to the back of the line also led some trams to make emergency stops due to danger.\nHopefully, another security screening station will open soon and the long line will be resolved.\nAll guests must go through security screening. In addition to the Transportation and Ticket Center, there are smaller security stations at the nearby resorts for park guests to go through.\nFor the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow\nWDW News Today on\nRelated posts:\nREVIEW: Mickey Mousse Ornament Treat From Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic KingdomNovember 8, 2022 PHOTOS: Three Little Pigs, Mulan, and Mushu Greet Guests for Lunar New Year at Disney California Adv...January 30, 2022 DeSantis' Central Florida Tourism Oversight District to Void Disney's Land Use Agreement and More at...April 20, 2023",

    "text": "(Reuters) - ChatGPT developer OpenAI said on Thursday it has released a research preview of its latest GPT-4.5 model for its Pro users and developers worldwide, with plans to expand access in the coming weeks.\nGPT-4.5 comes with improved ability to recognize patterns, generate creative insights without reasoning and shows greater emotional intelligence, the company said.\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI said it would begin rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Plus and Team users next week, and then to Enterprise and Edu users the following week.\nCEO Sam Altman called it \"a giant, expensive model,\" saying the company ran out of GPU capacity to roll out to user tiers at the same time.\n\"We will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week ... this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages,\" he said in a post on X.\nOpenAI said the model also has a lower rate of \"hallucinations\", a common issue in which large language models generate false information. At 37.1%, GPT-4.5's hallucination rate compares with the 61.8% shown by GPT-4o and 44% shown by its o1 reasoning model.\nGPT-4.5 supports file and image uploads and can also work on writing and coding projects, but does not currently support other advanced features such as voice and video.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. – Signs of the First Coast Expressway began popping up in St. Johns County as the next phase of the project takes shape.\nResidents said they are already noticing the changes, and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) provided updates on what to expect.\nRecommended Videos\nChristi Alvarez, a resident of Shearwater, moved to the area two years ago, not far from Trout Creek Academy. She recalled the moment she first heard the construction noise.\n“It was a total surprise,” she said.\nRELATED | FDOT unveils plans for next phase of First Coast Expressway construction in St. Johns County\nAround the southern part of the neighborhood, clearings and columns are visible, marking significant progress for FDOT.\nThe First Coast Expressway will eventually connect Interstate 10 to Interstate 95, providing direct access for residents on the Westside, as well as those in Clay and St. Johns counties.\nClick here to view an interactive map of the project\nThis segment of the expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million.\nThis segment of the First Coast Expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million. (FDOT) Sara Pleasants from FDOT explained what residents can expect in the coming months.\n“They will see some overpasses being built, with the piles for those, and then just new roadway construction, laying asphalt, curb and gutter, that kind of thing,” she said.\nJust a short drive from a local Jersey Mike’s near Silver Leaf, some shoppers mentioned they have begun noticing the changes brought by the expressway.\nMORE | Traffic relief in sight for Clay County commuters as First Coast Expressway project progresses\nPleasants went on to explain long-term project plans.\n“This is a multi-year project. They started last fall on this segment, and it’ll continue, likely until around 2030. Later this year, we expect to see construction start on that final segment, which will be east of County Road 2209, from St. Johns Parkway to I-95,” Pleasants added.\nDespite the noise and disruption, Alvarez sees the value in what’s coming.\n“Shearwater is wonderful. I often say it’s kind of like a 55-and-over community for young families,” she said, highlighting the appeal of her neighborhood.\nPleasants explained some of the louder noise of the pile driving should be done in the next couple of weeks.\nAs construction progresses, the First Coast Expressway promises to enhance connectivity and accessibility for residents, paving the way for future growth in the region.\nCopyright 2025 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",

For every film that turned out to be good, or at least decent, there were plenty that weren’t. Animated projects were often better, especially ones with Sonic the Hedgehog and friends, but many franchises didn’t dare test these waters. But then, the team at\nRiot Games decided to do things their own way and make a series dedicated to their games’ champions, and now, Arcane Season 2 has gotten its first teaser, and it’s a doozy.\nTo recap, the first season was about the story of VI and Jinx. The two sisters were brought up in incredibly different parts of society and forced to clash with one another. The show was so good that it wasn’t just a hit on Netflix; it won an Emmy award for its animation. The moment that season 1 was over, season 2 was anticipated. And with the teaser below, a key champion is about to make his debut in Arcane Season 2:\nYep, it’s none other than Warwick! The augmented wolf creature is one of the many experiments by Singed, and as the teaser highlights, the experiment to make Warwick what he needs to be is underway. The question here is, “Who is Warwick?” Well, he was a man that was turned into the beast you see. But his identity may change in the second season, as it’s heavily hinted that VI and Jinx’s father, Xander, might be the man whom Singed took and turned into the beast you see.\nIf this holds, then that means there will be plenty of “family drama” in season 2 to go around, and part of it will be the sisters having to team up to not just fight their father but potentially reach him from within his bestial form. Warwick, as a character, is full of rage due to the chemicals that Singed put in his body, so that won’t make him easily susceptible to pleas from his kids, not that he would recognize them in his wolf form.\nThe thing that fans are looking forward to the most is the worldbuilding and style that the first season had. The adaptation was beautiful, and while it took its sweet time to get made, fans will only have to wait until November for the second season to arrive.",
