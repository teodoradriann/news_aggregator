    "title": "Sirmione, avvolta dalle fiamme mentre cucina: morta dopo ore di agonia | Bresciaoggi",
    "text": "Una fiammata dai fornelli mentre preparava la cena, il fuoco che l'ha avvolta provocandole ustioni sul 90% del corpo, un giorno tremendo di agonia in ospedale e infine la tristissima notizia. Sirmione perde all'improvviso e drammaticamente una colonna portante della sua comunità. Silvana Bettanini, vedova dell'alpino storico Bruno Parolini, è venuta meno all'affetto dei suoi cari oggi pomeriggio, 16 luglio.\nLe gravissime ustioni riportate dall'incidente domestico della sera prima nella sua abitazione non le hanno lasciato scampo, la donna di 85 anni lascia nello sconforto 4 figli ei nipoti.\nL'incidente domestico\nErano circa le 19,30 quando la donna come ogni sera stava preparando la cena per lei e per il figlio Roberto, che viveva nella stessa abitazione a Colombare in via 4 novembre. Sui fornelli c'era solo un pentolino che la donna stava mescolando ma improvvisamente, il piano cottura avrebbe preso fuoco, forse per una fuga di gas, ma gli accertamenti sono ancora in corso. Le fiamme sono divampate con forza e all'improvviso e si sono immediatamente propagate di fronte a Silvana attaccandosi sui vestiti, probabilmente realizzati in tessuto sintetico.\nLe grida di aiuto e di dolore hanno allertato i vicini che, appena capito hanno cosa stessa succedendo, hanno cercato di intervenire e chiamando i Vigili del fuoco che sono arrivati dopo pochi minuti insieme all'ambulanza. La situazione che si sono trovati davanti è stata drammatica: i vigili hanno spento immediatamente le fiamme che avvolgevano l'85enne ormai riversa a terra, ma è apparso subito evidente che le ustioni erano gravissime.\nI sanitari hanno richiesto l'intervento dell'eliambulanza, cercando di tenere in vita Silvana che è stata trasportata in codice rosso nella terapia intensiva del Civile di Brescia: l'anziana aveva riportato ustioni sul 90 percento del suo corpo.\nLa donna, attaccata al respiratore, ha lottato con tutte le sue forze per tutta la notte ma questa mattina si è capito che non c'era più nulla da fare: la sua famiglia ha dato il consenso nel primo pomeriggio di staccare la spina, per evitarle ulteriori e soprattutto inutili sofferenze. Un drammatico incidente domestico, sul quale si cercano spiegazioni certe, che ha colpito duramente la comunità di Sirmione.\nChi era Silvana Bettanini\nSilvana Bettanini era di origini friulane, da giovane si era trasferita a Sirmione per convolare a nozze con Bruno Parolini: ex muratore in pensione e soprattutto alpino di ferro che è venuto a mancare nel 2021: “un grande personaggio”, secondo chi lo conosceva.\nI Parolini sono una famiglia storica della penisola da più generazioni e Silvana era molto amata sia tra i vicini di casa che in parrocchia: “Era una donna forte, ha sofferto tanto nella vita ma si è sempre rialzata, adesso non resta che pregare per lei e ricordarla come merita”, dice Don Francesco, il parroco della chiesa San Francesco di Colombare. Silvana Bettanini lascia nello sconforto i figli Stefania, Roberta, Fabio e Bruno ei suoi nipotini.",

    "text": "Best Crypto to Buy Now December 28 – Bitcoin SV, Aave, Arbitrum\nSelect cryptocurrencies are exhibiting bullish behavior to close out the year, making them potentially among the best cryptos to buy now–with Bitcoin SV rallying nearly 80%, Aave surging alongside Ethereum, and Arbitrum’s price increasing on the heels of layer 2 optimism.\nMeanwhile, ongoing crypto presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are also attracting investor attention.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now in the News\nBitcoin SV’s (BSV) price has seen a notable increase, with a 53.74% rise yesterday to $76.78 and an additional 16.46% surge today to $89.30.\nThis upward trend has sparked discussions on the sustainability of its rapid growth.\nTechnical indicators suggest that while the upward movement is strong, the current conditions may be overextended.\nUpbit’s share of trading volume has been pivotal for BSV’s performance, but reliance on this volume raises questions about the rally’s future.\nThe decentralized finance token Aave is currently priced around $117.41,\nwith whale activities contributing to its recent price action. A notable withdrawal of AAVE tokens from Binance by a large investor indicates a positive sentiment towards the asset.\nFurthermore, Aave’s value has surged alongside Ethereum, which recently reached $2,400.\nThe high correlation coefficient of 0.92 between ETH and AAVE prices suggests that Aave’s future could be closely tied to\nEthereum’s market movements.\nArbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has seen a 20% increase in value in just 24 hours, a rise that aligns with the growing interest in\nlayer 2 technologies.\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem has expanded, with a 50% growth in developer headcount year-over-year.\nSuch growth underscores the platform’s attractiveness and potential for further adoption.\nI've posted some updates on\n[$ARB].\nRetest at $0.98 did work, continuation towards $1.35 as well and even further.\nSome beautiful S/R flips, I think $1.40-1.45 should hold and we can continue to $2.\n[pic.twitter.com/wIFEg26zq8]\n— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL)\n[December 28, 2023]\nAnalysts like Michael van de Poppe have a positive outlook for ARB, with expectations of a bullish continuation that could see the token approach the $2 mark.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s commendation for Arbitrum as a stage 1 roll-up adds to the platform’s credibility and may influence its market performance.\nWith these established tokens making headlines, the crypto presales market is not far behind.\nProjects like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are stepping into the spotlight, offering Bitcoin alternatives worth checking.\nThese early-stage projects are creating a buzz with their unique propositions and are being closely watched by investors considering diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolios.\nAs the year draws to a close, these cryptocurrencies and crypto presales demonstrate the\nbroad selection of Bitcoin alternatives in the cryptocurrency market.\nBitcoin SV, Aave, and Arbitrum have solidified their positions as some of the best crypto to buy now, with each demonstrating unique factors that appeal to different segments of investors.\nMeanwhile, presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat present opportunities for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising new crypto ventures.\nBSV Price Rockets 16.46%: Resistance and Support Levels to Watch\nThe Bitcoin SV (BSV) price has seen an astounding rally over the past two days, with the cryptocurrency currently up by nearly 80%.\nThis intense surge comes amidst rising trading volumes from major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit.\nHowever, with the spike in volume primarily originating from this singular exchange, BSV’s rally could lose momentum if conviction fades.\nExamining the key BSV price technical indicators paints a mixed picture.\nThe 20-day EMA stands at $55.79 while the 50-day EMA sits at $51.15, with the BSV price well above both at $89.30.\nTypically, a price above its short and long-term EMAs signals bullish momentum.\nMeanwhile, the\nrelative strength index (RSI) has shot up to 87.27 from 83.05 yesterday.\nThis shows BSV is heavily overbought, signaling the price could be due for a pullback.\nThe MACD histogram sits at 3.48, a sizable increase from yesterday’s 1.69.\nThe growing positive value indicates a strengthening bullish sentiment behind the BSV price.\nWith BSV stabilizing north of $80, technical indicators remain conflicted.\nWhile overbought RSI hints at downside potential, surging volume and MACD highlight raging bullish momentum.\nTrading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation may be wise.\nA break past immediate resistance between $98.85 and $102.10 could signal an extended upswing.\nMeanwhile, support at the Fib 0.236 and 0.382 levels of $84.89 and $77.38 could cushion any declines.\nThe near-term direction will likely hinge on whether or not conviction holds as the BSV price ventures into overbought territory.\nAAVE Price Struggles to Hold Gains: Fib 0.236 Level as Immediate Resistance\nThe AAVE price has seen bullish momentum for the past few days, with the cryptocurrency up over 4% so far today.\nAAVE is attempting to break out past key resistance levels after setting a new year-to-date high of $129.88 earlier today.\nHowever, the AAVE price has struggled to retain its gains and is currently trading below the Fib 0.236 level of $119.79.\nThis area could act as immediate resistance if AAVE closes below this level.\nExamining key technical indicators shows there are mixed signals for AAVE’s price.\nThe 20-day EMA stands at $102.88, above the 50-day EMA of $97.18, which is typically seen as a bullish sign.\nHowever, the closeness of these EMAs indicates high volatility and uncertainty for the AAVE price.\nThe RSI is currently at 71.35, up from yesterday’s 66.87 and approaching overbought territory. This suggests upward momentum is building.\nMeanwhile, the MACD histogram sits at 1.25, an increase over yesterday’s 0.52. The growing positive value points to strengthening bullish sentiment.\nWith the AAVE price stabilizing above crucial support levels, indicators remain balanced between further upside and potential pullback.\nTrading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation of a breakout past resistance at $119.79 or support at the Fib 0.5 level of $108.53 may be prudent.\nA decisive close above the $120 resistance or a drop below the $108 support zone could set the trend for the AAVE price over the coming days. Careful risk management is key amidst the mixed signals.\nARB Struggles to Extend Higher: Potential Near-Term Weakness Ahead\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) price saw increased volatility yesterday after breaking out from a period of consolidation and posting gains of 13.51%.\nHowever, despite setting a new multi-month high earlier today, ARB is struggling to extend higher so far today, pointing to potential near-term weakness.\nCurrently trading around $1.50, the ARB price is down 0.44% so far today. This marks a pullback after ARB hit a multi-month high of $1.6691 earlier in the session.\nWith the cryptocurrency facing resistance confluent with key Fib levels, ARB appears set for a potential correction.\nLooking at technical indicators, the 20-day EMA for ARB stands at $1.2682, above the 50-day EMA at $1.1568.\nThis bullish crossover shows upside momentum in the short term. However, ARB trading back below the 20-day EMA could signal waning momentum.\nThe RSI for ARB is currently reading 68.41, down slightly from 69 yesterday.\nThis shows bullish momentum slowing despite remaining in overbought territory above 70.\nThe fading RSI highlights the potential for a pullback after the recent surge.\nAt the same time, the MACD histogram sits at 0.0308, up from 0.0288 yesterday.\nThe histogram growing more positive indicates bullish momentum remains intact.\nHowever, a histogram rollover could foreshadow an ARB price drop.\nWith the ARB price around $1.50, the cryptocurrency is testing resistance between $1.5740 and $1.6085.\nThis area aligns with the Fib -0.382 level at $1.5861. A failure here signals potential downside ahead.\nOn support, ARB shows the previous resistance zone of $1.4188 to $1.4637 in focus.\nThis area could catch a pullback after flipping to support.\nBelow that, the Fib 0.382 and 0.236 levels around $1.35 mark the next key support zone.\nAnalyzing volume and market cap provides added context. ARB saw its market cap climb to $321 million, up from $308 million yesterday.\nHowever, 24-hour trading volume fell to just $19 million. The diverging metrics highlight uncertainty.\nOverall, after spiking to multi-month highs, the ARB price appears vulnerable to a pullback as bullish momentum slows.\nThe test of resistance confluent with extended Fib levels underscores risks. Against this backdrop, trading within defined risk limits seems prudent.\nA decisive break above $1.60 resistance or a drop below $1.35 support could set the stage for the next major trending move.\nIn the near term, ranging could persist for ARB while awaiting the next catalyst.\nWhile major cryptocurrencies grapple with near-term directional uncertainty, speculative crypto presales offer exposure to new ecosystems.\nSponge V2 and Meme Kombat exemplify this, merging memes and gaming with cryptocurrencies.\nNavigating New Avenues in Cryptocurrency: A Look at Proming Bitcoin Alternatives\nThe cryptocurrency market, traditionally anchored by\nBitcoin, is witnessing a growing interest in developing blockchain projects.\nThis trend is a departure from the usual focus on\nestablished market leaders, signaling a strategic shift among investors.\nThese new projects, like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat, are increasingly catching the eye of savvy investors.\nTheir potential for growth in the early stages is a key factor in their rising popularity.\nThis shift indicates a move towards a more diversified investment approach, focusing on developmental cryptocurrencies rather than mainstream ones.\nInvesting in these developing crypto ventures, particularly through presale opportunities, presents a unique chance for early involvement in their growth trajectory.\nFor those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios, paying attention to these Bitcoin alternatives could be a wise decision.\nThe concept of the ‘best crypto to buy now’ is evolving. It’s no longer just about the most popular names in the market.\nBitcoin alternatives, often lesser-known but with substantial growth potential, are becoming increasingly relevant.\nSponge Token Success Sparks Excitement for Sponge V2 Presale: Is It the Best Crypto to Buy Now?\nThe meme coin Sponge (SPONGE) is launching a presale for its second version, Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2), coming on the heels of the success of the original meme coin in May.\nThe first Sponge Token saw substantial gains during the recent memecoin boom, reaching a peak market capitalization of nearly $100 million.\nNow, Sponge V2 seeks to build on that momentum with an upgraded meme coin.\n🔥 Important Reminder! 🔥\nYou must take your staked\n[$SPONGE]tokens from the V1 staking contract and stake them in our V2 smart contract. 🙌\nYou can do this via our website to secure your share of the V2 token once it launches. 🧽🧽🧽\n[#SpongeCoin] [#Web3] [#Crypto] [pic.twitter.com/u2HKxKz3cM]\n— $SPONGE (@spongeoneth)\n[December 28, 2023] According to the Sponge V2 website, the new token will introduce staking rewards and a play-to-earn game.\nSponge V2 will be launching as an ERC-20 token on the\nEthereum blockchain through a bridging method the team calls “stake-to-bridge.”\nHolders of the original Sponge Token can stake their tokens to earn Sponge V2 tokens when they launch.\nSponge V1 tokens staked will be locked permanently in the V2 staking pool and accumulate V2 tokens over four years.\nThe Sponge V2 presale seeks to further capitalize on the meme coin hype and offer staking rewards of up to 613% APY to draw in buyers.\nT\nhe project said on social media that the presale seeks to “absorb liquidity and establish dominance in the crypto space.”\nSponge V2 has allocated 26.93% of the token supply for bridging from V1, 43.09% for staking rewards, and 10% to centralized exchange liquidity.\nThe tokenomics also include allocations for marketing, game development, and play-to-earn rewards.\nThe original Sponge Token gained traction during the recent surge of interest in meme coins.\nNow, the team behind that project is leveraging its community and marketing playbook to try and replicate the success with Sponge V2.\nWhile meme coins remain highly speculative assets, the Sponge ecosystem has already proven it can attract substantial hype.\nThe Sponge V2 presale offers an opportunity for those interested in the meme coin space to get in early before the new token launches.\nMeme Kombat: The Best Crypto to Buy Now for Memes and Crypto Gaming Enthusiasts\nRiding the momentum of the meme coin phenomenon, a cryptocurrency startup named Meme Kombat seeks to blend memes and play-to-earn gaming.\nThe platform’s MK token presale has already exceeded $5 million in contributions.\nWe hit $5 million raised in the\n[$MK]presale🎉🚀\nCongrats fighters!\n[pic.twitter.com/SK5TGEuson]\n— Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe core of Meme Kombat is its\nupcoming crypto gaming platform enabling users to battle popular meme characters. Powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the outcomes of these PvP clashes will be randomly determined.\nPlayers can stake Meme Kombat tokens and bet on match results, earning MK token rewards when their selected meme fighter wins.\nWith its interactive gameplay and community focus, Meme Kombat wants to offer something new compared to typical meme coins.\nThe game will feature fan-favorite memes like\nSpongeBob, Wojak, and Shiba Inu as playable characters to attract engagement.\nLeading the project are founder Matt Whiteman and his public-facing development team.\nWhiteman’s credentials are viewable on LinkedIn, underscoring Meme Kombat’s commitment to transparency.\nMeme Kombat’s tokenomics allocate 50% of tokens to presale participants, 30% to staking rewards, 10% to liquidity pools, and 10% to community initiatives.\nThis distribution intends to incentivize presale buyers to actively participate post-launch by gaming and staking their MK tokens.\nWhile risky like any crypto investment, Meme Kombat provides a unique value proposition through its creative fusion of memes and play-to-earn gaming.\nThe presale’s strong momentum highlights enthusiastic demand for Meme Kombat’s interactive platform.\nAs the token sale enters its final stages, the closing period often gives buyers the optimal window to acquire tokens before exchange listings.\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

    "text": "Os 10% mais ricos do mundo causaram dois terços do aquecimento global desde 1990 Por Green Savers com Lusa 1:18 - 8 Maio 2025\nPartilhar Os 10% mais ricos da população mundial são responsáveis por dois terços do aquecimento global desde 1990 e pelo aumento de eventos climáticos extremos, como ondas de calor e secas, derivados da crise climática, segundo um estudo.\nA investigação, publicada na revista Nature Climate Change e citado na quarta-feira pela agência Efe, avaliou até que ponto os diferentes grupos e sociedades contribuem para as emissões e revelou que o 1% mais rico do mundo contribuiu 26 vezes mais do que a média global para o aumento dos extremos de temperatura global e 17 vezes mais para as secas na Amazónia.\nO trabalho, conduzido pela ETH Zurich (Suíça), mostra a relação entre a desigualdade de emissões baseada no rendimento e a injustiça climática, revelando que o consumo e os investimentos dos ricos tiveram e continuam a ter um impacto desproporcional nos eventos climáticos extremos.\nEstes efeitos são “especialmente graves em regiões tropicais vulneráveis, como a Amazónia, o Sudeste Asiático e o Sul de África”, que historicamente têm contribuído menos para as emissões globais.\nO estudo mostra que os impactos climáticos extremos não são apenas o resultado de emissões globais abstratas, mas “podem estar diretamente ligados a estilos de vida e escolhas de investimento, que por sua vez estão ligados à riqueza”, sublinhou Sarah Schöngart, investigadora da ETH Zurique e principal autora do estudo.\n“Verificámos que os emissores ricos desempenham um papel significativo na condução dos extremos climáticos”, e isso “fornece um forte apoio às políticas climáticas que visam reduzir as suas emissões”, salientou Schöngart.\nUtilizando um modelo que combinava dados económicos e simulações climáticas, os investigadores conseguiram rastrear as emissões de diferentes grupos de rendimentos globais e avaliar a sua contribuição para extremos climáticos específicos.\nAssim, descobriram que as emissões dos 10% mais ricos da população dos Estados Unidos e da China, somente, multiplicaram as temperaturas extremas em regiões vulneráveis em duas ou três vezes.\n“Se todos tivessem emitido como os 50% mais pobres da população global, o aquecimento global teria sido mínimo desde 1990”, garantiu Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, coautor do estudo e diretor do Grupo de Investigação de Impactos Climáticos Integrados do IIASA.\n“Corrigir este desequilíbrio é crucial para uma ação climática justa e eficaz”, lembrou o investigador.\nO estudo também destaca a importância das emissões ligadas a investimentos financeiros e afirma que focar-se nos fluxos financeiros e nas carteiras de indivíduos com rendimentos elevados pode gerar benefícios climáticos substanciais.\nOs autores acreditam que estas descobertas podem ajudar a lançar instrumentos de políticas progressistas dirigidas às elites sociais e realçam que fazer os poluidores ricos pagarem também pode fornecer o apoio muito necessário para a adaptação e perdas e danos em países vulneráveis.\nReequilibrar a responsabilidade pela ação climática de acordo com o contributo real para as emissões “é essencial”, não só para conter o aquecimento global, “mas também para alcançar um mundo mais justo e resiliente”, concluem os autores.\nPartilhar",
