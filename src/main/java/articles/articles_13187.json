    "title": "Nintendo announces Switch 2 release date, price - NewsBreak",
    "text": "After enough rumors to sink the Titanic, we finally know: The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5. On release day, the base console will cost $449, while a bundled version with a digital copy of Mario Kart World will be available for $499.99. Customers will be able to preorder the Nintendo Switch 2 beginning April 9. Wednesday, an informational Nintendo Direct video presentation announced a brand-new Mario Kart game to lead the pack in day-and-date releases alongside a series of hardware updates aimed to set the Switch 2 apart from its predecessor. More games — and the buttons to press them with — below. Hardware upgrades The Nintendo Switch 2 is bigger and more powerful in every way. With a 7.9 inch LCD screen, the Switch 2 dwarfs the Switch’s 6.2 inches. While it largely looks the same –— hence the dolefully uninspired name — the Switch 2 will have a sturdier U-shaped kickstand, stronger speakers, and the ability to output 4K resolution to TV for select games. With a more powerful CPU, it will be able to play far more demanding games at faster speeds and with better graphics than the straining Switch. The original Switch’s 1,280x720 pixel resolution has long been outdated, so the Switch 2’s 1080p LCD screen that can get up to 120Hz refresh rate is a welcome upgrade, if not a revolutionary one. Instead of sliding onto the console, the Switch 2’s new Joy-Cons connect with a magnetic snap for easier configuration. They can also be turned to the side and used as a computer mouse, which will make it easier to play games designed for mouse and keyboard, such as the confirmed port of world strategy game Sid Meier’s Civilization VII. The Nintendo Switch 2 will release with 256 GB of internal storage. Eight times the storage of the Switch, it still pales in comparison to the more than 600 GBs offered by the PlayStation 5. The Switch 2 will be backwards-compatible, which means players will be able to play the vast majority of original Switch games, digital or physical, on the new system. A list of incompatible games can be found on Nintendo’s website. Chat with friends One of the Switch 2’s biggest additions is GameChat. By pressing the “C button,” users can initiate or join audio calls during online multiplayer games sessions. With a microphone built into the Switch 2, Nintendo is touting a noise-canceling feature that will allow players to keep talking with friends even through disruptive background noise. Players can also purchase the separate Nintendo Switch 2 Camera for $49.99 or hook up a compatible USB-C camera to initiate voice chat with their friends or family. GameChat is a substantive update from the original Switch, which boasted a difficult-to-parse friend code system. If it works as smoothly as Nintendo hopes, it’ll keep players from turning to the popular third-party app Discord while bolstering Nintendo’s reputation for family-friendly group play. Players must be a member of the paid Nintendo Switch Online service in order to access GameChat. However, in order to showcase the console’s new features, GameChat will be free from the console’s June 5 release until March 31, 2026. Local play GameShare will allow players to share select Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 titles with friends who don’t own the game. As long as each person has their own Switch or Switch 2, players who’ve purchased a game can temporarily share it with friends in the same physical location. It’s a wonderful family-friendly feature that will earn Nintendo some deserved goodwill. In a digital-only world where sharing games feels on the precipice of disappearing, Nintendo should be proud of making it easier to share games with our loved ones — especially our youngest family members. Titles eventually slated for GameShare include Captain Toad , Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury , Super Mario Odyssey , and Big Brain Academy . But the first title they’re releasing GameShare for? Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics . With familiar faces like solitaire, mancala, chess, and mahjong, you can finally do on Switch what you’ve been able to do on spyware-infected browser websites all along: play poker with your grandpa. I guess Clubhouse Games didn’t sell all that well. Special editions Popular Switch games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, its sequel Tears of the Kingdom , Super Mario Party Jamboree , and Kirby and the Forgotten Land will receive paid upgrades called Nintendo Switch 2 Expanded Edition upgrade packs. Jamboree’s update will add motion and voice mini-games, while fans of Kirby and the Forgotten Land fans can play through an entirely new story added to the original. Like the other titles, both Zelda games will see enhanced visuals and performance. The Nintendo Switch Online phone app will also feature an update on something called Zelda Notes, which can give real-time help to players seeking out Hyrule’s peskiest secrets. Current owners of these games on the original Switch will have to pay an as-yet-unspecified price for these upgrades. Nintendo also announced that they would implement free upgrades to select titles. New Nintendo games How do you follow up Mario Kart 8 , the fifth best-selling game of all time? You make it open world. Mario Kart World has a bright future. Opening up Mario Kart’s tried-and-true formula to allow friends to race around the world together is a brilliant way to differentiate it from the titan that came before. Nintendo also announced Drag X Drive , a wheelchair basketball game that relies on mouse controls, hack-and-slash Tears of the Kingdom prequel Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment , and Donkey Kong Bananza , a long-desired 3-D platformer starring the original video game gorilla. The Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will also launch with the console. Like Astro’s Playroom on PlayStation 5, this launch game is designed to show players around their new system’s controls. Unlike Astro’s Playroom , Nintendo is charging for it. Hopefully, it won’t be very much — although with digital games rumored at $80 bucks a pop and physical game cartridges at $90, that seems less likely than ever. Third-party titles Plenty of games previously released on other consoles are confirmed to be coming out on Switch 2. These include Elden Ring , Street Fighter 6 , Cyberpunk 2077 , Split Fiction , Hogwarts Legacy , Hades 2 , and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 . New games include The Duskbloods , an original title by Dark Souls and Elden Ring creator FromSoftware that will be exclusive to Switch 2. Known for their challenging gameplay and dark fantasy worlds, The Duskbloods is a surprise addition to family-friendly Nintendo’s lineup sure to turn a few heads and bring in a few more console purchases. With a decent release lineup and robust hardware updates, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a bigger, better Switch with all of the Switch’s kinks ironed out. Player-friendly features like GameShare and GameChat dull the sting of console-wide price hikes — but if the rumors of $80-90 games are true, the pill still goes down a little sour.
