    "text": "(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office issued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having some of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner told the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "text": "ALBANY – The long-time leader of Sweet Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church was installed earlier this month as the leader of a statewide convention of missionary Baptist congregations. Rev. Elgin J. Taylor Sr., is now the head of more than 300 churches as head of the Empire Baptist Missionary Convention. Taylor has served as pastor at Sweet Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Arbor Hill since March 2010. Being a pastor was a dream ever since he was very young, he said. And being chosen to lead the body that oversees the missionary Baptist churches in the state was an exciting and emotional moment. That night he was thinking of his mother and other family members who had served in the convention. “To be able to see me now, in that place where they once worked and where they served so faithfully, it was an overwhelming feeling of excitement and joy,” he said. “It was a feeling of, 'I can't believe this is happening.'” Taylor comes from a religious family with roots in the Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church going back six generations. Growing up, he would walk around telling family members he would be a pastor when he grew up. “My siblings and cousins they talk about how we always had to play church in the basement, and I was always the pastor,” he said. “You know, they tease me about it now. But it's been something that's been part of my life all of my life.” Taylor began training for the ministry in 2006 under the Rev. Reverend Ronald Grant at the Shiloh Baptist Church of Hudson, where he served as executive minister to the pastor and minister of music and was ordained as a minister in 2010, according to a 2012 Times Union story. Taylor previously served the convention in several roles, including the director of music, president of the young people’s auxiliary and vice president at-large. He felt called by God to continue his service and run for election as the organization’s president. “I've been involved in the work and I just always knew somewhere along the line, that it was my destiny to be where I am today,” he said. As part of his duties Taylor will help guide the convention’s missionary work, including foreign missions. His term is for three years, with an option for another three years. “I'm responsible to pull together the team that does the programming that fulfills the mission of the convention,” he said. “We do a lot of missionary projects to help people, to help churches, not just in New York state, but we've gone globally.” While his new role will take him across the state, Taylor said his focus on his congregation at Sweet Pilgrim won’t waver. The venerable church is beginning a fundraising drive to support a $1.6 million expansion project for the 147-year-old structure, including making the church more accessible to senior worshippers and those with mobility issues. “I have this big thing going on in New York state. But the truth is my main priority remains at home,” he said.",

    "text": "Micron Surges 2.48% on $1.87B Volume to 37th U.S. Liquidity Rank as Analysts Hike Price Targets to $165 and Institutional Buyers Pile In\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rose 2.48% on July 30, 2025, with a trading volume of $1.87 billion, ranking 37th among U.S. stocks by liquidity. The move followed a surge in analyst optimism, with price targets raised across multiple firms, ranging from $140 to $165, reflecting confidence in the company’s recent earnings performance and strategic positioning in the semiconductor sector.\nParnassus Value Equity Fund highlighted Micron as a key holding in its Q2 2025 investor letter, citing its role in the firm’s concentrated portfolio of large-cap U.S. stocks. The fund outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, with a 7.24% return for the quarter. Institutional investor activity further underscored Micron’s appeal, as holdings by entities like CIBC Private Wealth Group and Janus Henderson Group increased significantly in Q4 2024, with the latter adding 1.13 million shares valued at $113 million.\nTechnical and fundamental indicators aligned to support the stock’s recent momentum. Micron’s Q3 2025 earnings of $1.91 per share exceeded analyst estimates by 21%, while revenue reached $9.3 billion, outpacing expectations. Analysts from Piper Sandler, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen upgraded their price targets, with Piper Sandler setting a new $165 target—a 46% increase from its prior level. Despite short-term technical headwinds, including a 3.84% dip in the prior week, the stock’s strong cash flow and gross profit margins signaled resilience amid sector volatility.\nThe strategy of purchasing the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day generated a 166.71% return from 2022 to 2025, outperforming the benchmark by 137.53 percentage points. This approach demonstrated a 31.89% compound annual growth rate, highlighting the effectiveness of capitalizing on high-liquidity stocks and short-term market sentiment shifts.\nComments\nNo comments yet",
