    "text": "Apple, in its effort to advance its success in the industry, is preparing to implement various changes. The company, which claims to make devices ‘smarter’, aims to use more powerful hardware and strengthen the interaction between humans and technology. Here are the details: Apple products will now be smarter! The rapidly advancing technology has pushed the entire tech world, including major corporations, to take innovative steps. Known for its innovative approach, Apple plans to further its position in the sector by developing smarter and more successful products. The company is taking serious steps based on more advanced artificial intelligence models and superior performance hardware. In today’s technology, our smart devices can take voice commands from us and respond to them, monitor our heart rate and blood oxygen levels in real-time, translate all world languages into each other, and allow us to video chat with our loved ones. These functions have become quite standard. However, artificial intelligence technology, which is just starting to be integrated into our lives, has not yet reached this level of ordinariness. Apple, wanting to redefine the norms at this point, plans to spend more time on artificial intelligence technology in the coming period to introduce state-of-the-art products to the user experience. With this leap, the tech giant aims to surpass the current limitations of artificial intelligence technology and is trying to bring a new perspective to the AI models used in its devices. Apple’s research team has tackled the issue of ‘memory’, one of the biggest factors limiting artificial intelligence. Thanks to a new method discovered during the research process, artificial intelligence models can operate at a capacity equivalent to twice the DRAM size of the device while significantly speeding up CPU and GPU operations. The steps taken by the company within this mindset seem to set the stage for the beginning of a new era in the technology world. We expect the company, which will be discussed in the future with much more successful results, is allocating a significant budget for these steps. What do you think about this topic?

This means that during the afternoon, when we hit our high in the mid 90s, it'll actually feel anywhere from 105-110. There could be some momentary relief with an afternoon cold front producing some sporadic storms that may bring temperatures down.\nA few of these storms could be on the hefty side with some strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall being the primary threats. We could also see a few small hailstones possible. Timing on these storms will be towards Friday afternoon/evening.\nBeyond Friday, we are very dry. A dominant high pressure system will build into our area pushing all the rain chances away from us. This will not only keep us dry, but also allow that heat to build back.\nThis weekend will have low temperatures in the low to mid 70s with high temperatures in the mid 90s. Although we will be slightly cooler, heat indices in excess of 100 degrees are likely. That means heat advisories will once again be issued. If you can battle the heat, then there should be beautiful sky conditions to enjoy some outdoor fun.\nTracking the Tropics: Invest 97L continues to pick up steam as it moves over the Greater Antilles. This will continue to move northwest into the Gulf of Mexico by early next week. Right now, projections have it sticking around the Florida coast along the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico before moving northeast into the Carolinas. Although we won't see any direct effects from the tropical system, this is going to be a big factor on our temperatures.

    "text": "The prevailing assumption in psychiatric practice, embedded within the Mental Health Act 1983/2007 (MHA), is that individuals with a personality disorder can be objectively assessed and managed, with compulsory detention criteria applied in a manner similar to other conditions, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\nThis article challenges this assumption, arguing that the fundamental relational nature of personality disorders renders traditional assessment frameworks under Part 2 of the MHA not only inadequate, but potentially harmful.\nFurthermore, considering the restrictive and controlling nature of in-patient psychiatric care, and the lack of overall therapeutic approach and evidence-based interventions on in-patient units, the legal and ethical justification for compulsory detention of individuals with personality disorders is unclear. Despite the intended progressive reforms of the Mental Health Bill (MHB), its capacity to change the entrenched patterns of mismanagement in this patient group is questionable.\nRethinking personality disorders\nIndividual personality refers to enduring patterns of thoughts, emotions, motivations and behaviours that shape an individual’s way of relating to themselves and others. Although personality is inherently adaptive, personality disorders are characterised by rigid and maladaptive patterns of interpersonal functioning, causing significant impairment. In practice, diagnosing personality disorders is challenging because of their variability, symptom instability and overlap with normal personality traits and other psychiatric conditions.\nHistorically, in line with the medical disease model, personality disorders were conceptualised categorically, but contemporary research highlights their dimensional nature. Rather than fixed, discrete conditions, personality disorders are now understood to exist along a spectrum, with significant variability influenced by context and relationships.\nPersonality disorders have strong developmental underpinnings, with early-life adversity strongly predicting the severity. Attachment theory posits that early caregiving interactions shape internal relational models, influencing future interpersonal functioning. Secure attachments promote trust and stability, whereas adverse childhood experiences lead to maladaptive relational templates and epistemic mistrust. Mentalisation theory explains how disorganised attachment disrupts reflective functioning undermining relational stability.\nInterpersonal theory conceptualises personality pathology as inherently relational, arising from difficulties in how individuals perceive, interact with, and understand themselves in relation to others. From this perspective, personality disorders differ from other psychiatric conditions because their primary manifestation is in relationships, and could therefore be better thought of as interpersonal disorders.\nTrapped by the MHA\nMHA assessments are inherently relational encounters that are shaped by unconscious relational dynamics that may distort decision-making. These assessments often involve power imbalances that reinforce dysfunctional relational patterns. Assessors often find themselves in a double-bind, not because of any failing on their part or the patient’s, but because of the very nature of the personality difficulty itself. As a result, their decision can end up reflecting the patient’s unconscious dynamics, either through detention, which echoes past experiences of coercion and control, or discharge, which may feel like rejection or abandonment. In both cases, there is a risk of unintentionally re-enacting earlier trauma.\nIndividuals with a personality disorder often present to emergency services in crisis, leading to repeated detentions related to ‘risk management’. The trauma of repeated crisis detentions, particularly those involving police, can further contribute to relational difficulties and mistrust of services, ultimately increasing recurrent suicidal crises.\nReference Warrington1\nThis is concerning, as frequent psychiatric emergency presentations have been identified as a strong predictor of suicide attempts, with each additional visit further increasing the risk.\nReference Coyle, Shaver and Linehan2\nDetained but not treated\nPsychiatrists frequently detain individuals with personality disorders under the MHA despite the lack of evidence-based interventions delivered in a compulsory in-patient setting.\nReference Baldwin and Beazley3\nParadoxically, contrary to its therapeutic intention, compulsory in-patient admissions for individuals with personality disorders frequently result in developmental regression, worsening psychopathology and heightened suicidal behaviour.\nReference Lundahl, Torenfält, Helgesson and Juth4\nInvoluntary psychiatric detention is frequently experienced as distressing, coercive and re-traumatising; patients often report fear, powerlessness and a lack of autonomy, and perceive coercive measures such as restraint and forced medication as punitive.\nReference Akther, Molyneaux, Stuart, Johnson, Simpson and Oram5\nSome aspects of hospital admission itself, such as trauma, loss of autonomy and social disruption, may contribute to suicidality. Patients with personality disorders may be particularly vulnerable to these experiences because admissions often exacerbate their distress. A dose−response relationship has been observed, with longer or repeated admissions correlating with higher suicide rates, raising concerns that hospital admission may not always be protective.\nReference Large, Chung, Davidson, Weiser and Ryan6\nFurthermore, locked in-patient environments do not necessarily reduce risk, and evidence suggests that risk can be effectively managed in open residential settings, such as therapeutic communities, which prioritise relational security, structured support and patient autonomy over coercion and restriction.\nReference Huber, Schneeberger, Kowalinski, Fröhlich, von Felten and Walter7\nWhen law and ethics collide\nOne of the more controversial aspects of compulsory detention of individuals with a personality disorder is the questionable ethical justification, given that many patients retain decision-making capacity even during crisis episodes.\nReference Lundahl, Helgesson and Juth8\nThe justification for overriding autonomy based purely on perceived risk is increasingly untenable, as it conflicts with broader principles in medical ethics and law, where competent patients’ decisions, however unwise, are respected.\nComparatively, under the MHA, individuals cannot be detained solely for substance addiction, recognising their right to make unwise decisions. Despite addiction undoubtedly being a disturbance of the mind, involving neurocognitive adaptations that drive harmful decision-making, this standard is not applied to personality disorders, highlighting legislative inconsistency.\nAdditionally, clinicians often admit that risk-driven compulsory detentions are influenced by defensive practices motivated by fear of litigation, media scrutiny or personal anxiety rather than genuine clinical benefit.\nReference Lundahl, Helgesson and Juth9\nFurthermore, it is ethically and legally problematic to justify compulsory detention solely based on suicide risk assessments, which remain fundamentally unreliable and imprecise.\nReference Large, Myles, Myles, Corderoy, Weiser and Davidson10\nIt is also worth noting that some suicides may occur despite good psychiatric care, just as myocardial infarctions still occur despite good cardiac care. The pursuit of total risk elimination through coercive measures may paradoxically worsen outcomes. As a profession, psychiatrists must take a leading role in helping wider society, policy makers and legislators come to terms with the limits of our interventions.\nThe Mental Health Bill: progress or more of the same?\nThe new MHB introduces four principles intended to guide mental health practice toward more ethical and patient-centred care. However, for individuals with a personality disorder, these principles are unlikely to translate into meaningful change without specific legislative provisions.\nThe principle of choice and autonomy is frequently compromised in practice, as these patients commonly retain the capacity to make decisions, albeit unwise, even in crisis. Detaining someone who understands the implications of their decisions undermines autonomy and contravenes general medical ethical and legal principles. In medicine, competent patients can refuse life-saving treatment, yet this standard is inconsistently applied in psychiatry.\nThe principle of least restriction is similarly challenged by the routine application of overly restrictive measures, including restraints and compulsory medication. These often re-traumatise the patient and result in self-perpetuating cycles of behavioural disturbance and restraint.\nThe principle of therapeutic benefit is particularly problematic given that evidence-based therapies are scarcely delivered in in-patient units, and no psychotropic medication has been licensed or shown to be effective. Thus, detaining these patients frequently lacks genuine therapeutic justification, raising questions about its legality and ethical validity.\nFinally, the principle of seeing the person as an individual is undermined by the coercive nature of compulsory detentions, which are often risk-focused and result in further fragmentation of an already unstable identity.\nBeyond coercion, toward meaningful reform\nThe new MHB, although well-intentioned, fails to sufficiently address the systemic and conceptual flaws in how patients with personality disorders are assessed and treated under the MHA. For genuine change, legislation must explicitly recognise the fundamentally relational and interpersonal nature of personality disorders. It must move away from risk-focused, restrictive and coercive care, and toward a more capacity-based, trauma-informed and relational framework in line with contemporary understanding of these conditions.\nThe MHB should actively limit compulsory in-patient detention, especially when patients are competent to make decisions, even if those are perceived as unwise by others. One way would be fusion legislation, exemplified by Northern Ireland’s Mental Capacity Act (2016), which merges mental health and capacity laws. Under such a framework, individuals with decision-making capacity cannot be involuntarily detained. It is important to recognise that apparently unwise decision-making in an individual with a personality disorder is contextual, and often represents an interpersonal phenomena rather than an internal temporary but remediable state. As such, the process of capacity assessment could not be applied in its current form without relevant modifications.\nIt is difficult to justify compulsory detention based on risk when detention itself increases risk. Although brief informal crisis admissions to structured, personality disorder-informed therapeutic settings may be beneficial, repeated detentions under the MHA Section 2 for individuals with well-established diagnoses add little clinical value and should be restricted legally.\nFor example, a modification to the MHA criteria for admission under Section 2 should actively restrict detention of patients whose presentation is consistent with their diagnosis and known difficulties. A clause explicitly stating that the detention in a hospital setting is unlikely to worsen the patient’s mental disorder could also be added.\nDetentions under MHA Section 3 should be abolished, as evidence-based treatments for personality disorders cannot be delivered under coercion. We propose that in complex cases, where MHA Section 3 is currently used, consideration should be given to informal long-term residential units. Until legal coercion is available and widely used, such units are unlikely to be adopted and developed.\nThe essence of the proposal in this article is rooted in the principle of ‘do no harm’ and would align mental health law with ethical principles and contemporary scientific understanding.\nAbout the authors\nRuslan Zinchenko is a specialty registrar (ST7) in general psychiatry and medical psychotherapy in a psychotherapy service in Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Preston, UK.

    "text": "Rick Morton ’s writing career has benefited from his wit and talent for prose, and the Walkley award-winning newshound doesn’t disappoint in his latest book about the public service scandal we all can’t get enough of: robodebt.\nBut much like any person obsessed with details, understanding how things work, why decisions are made, and the machinations of government power, exposure to enough weighty truth can also be taxing.\n“I’m glad it’s done, and I’ll be even happier when I no longer have to talk about it,” Morton told The Mandarin.\n“It’s been an incredibly painful process, partly because of my own Catholic guilt and reflecting on things that I wasn’t there [for] or missed [in reporting over the years], and also then just seeing the way other people respond to their own mistakes,” he said.\nAhead of a special event discussing his new book at the Canberra Writers Festival this weekend, Morton said the most frustrating thing about the illegal debt-collecting scheme which ran between July 2015 and November 2019 was that even today, almost a decade on, there was no happy conclusion.\nFollowing a Federal Court case, a royal commission , a referral to the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) that subsequently flatlined, an APSC-led workplace inquiry and sanctions for a small number of government actors, the robodebt story feels oddly incomplete.\n“The publisher was like, ‘We need a more uplifting final chapter’. I’m like, ‘I don’t have one.’,” Morton said.\n“It’s not because I’m overly cynical about everything — if anything, I can be a little bit too rose-coloured glasses about things — but writing and paying this much attention to this, particularly for the last two-and-a-half years, has just absolutely wrecked me,” he said.\nSome people involved in robodebt have been named and shamed , key Coalition ministers who orchestrated the policy conditions that allowed a social security system to be as weaponised against people have issued remorseful statements but deflected responsibility, and the APS commissioner, Gordon de Browuer, has now ruled at least 97 breaches of the code of conduct were committed by public servants.\nBut nobody has been sacked over their involvement in the process, and nobody charged by the police.\nAll we have is a terrible cautionary tale about all the ways the government’s duty to the public can fall off the wagon, symbolic apologies from ministers of the day, and an ongoing reticence to change royal commission recommendation 57 around secrecy provisions for cabinet documents.\n“The royal commission can make their findings, and you can see in the back of my book, there’s a whole bunch of responses from people who’ve had findings made against them, who just say: ‘Well, you shouldn’t take anything the royal commission did as true, because here’s why we don’t believe it,’” Morton said.\n“And they can point to other institutional failures, like the NACC and say: ‘See, they said there might be a risk of creating an unequal outcome so we should not believe what the royal commission says’.\n“It’s not enough to go backwards in time [to achieve justice or find accountability] anymore.”\nMorton reflected that robodebt’s ultimate consequences were unsatisfactory given the scale of the harm caused by the scheme and the way debt collectors and bureaucrats treated vulnerable people .\nSome of those who have been accused of wrongdoing in the robodebt scandal visibly bristle the moment it’s mentioned to them, which shows they know it is not something to be proud of being associated with.\nBut mostly, because ‘ministerial responsibility’ has lost all meaning over the years, the journalist said, he suspected there was a general view that people did not care enough about the injustice suffered by welfare recipients for a reputational mark against chief robodebt offenders to count for much.\n“The story is bleak and, because of that revisionist history [at play], it is so complex,” Morton said.\n“People who should have been self-reflecting by now are not, and can move the pieces [of the story] around in just the right way that it kind of looks reasonable and nice from the outside, and imply that maybe this was all a big hubbub about nothing — I just don’t think that’s fair.”\nThe injustice of subpar accountability was exacerbated by powerful actors who were deft hands in spin, public relations and expert in avoiding mud from sticking , Morton added.\n“There really is a mean streak in the psyche that runs through this country — some things are not worth defending according to the status quo,” he said.\nThroughout his book, Morton shows how victims who were capable of overcoming the cruelty of a system were either supported by a strong network of family and friends or prepared to go in and fight a process they knew was wrong all along.\nMost people complied and believed what the government was telling them was true — at serious personal, financial and psychological cost.\n“There are so many ways that people suffered in robodebt, and I wanted to get a little bit of a flavour of that,” Morton said.\n“There’s a family at the end of the book, just within days of the solicitor-general’s opinion coming in, whose daughter died of a heroin overdose. She had a debt and was trying to get into rehab, which was expensive. I wanted those moments to be peppered throughout the book.\n“But equally, if there’s any value I can bring to it, I think is in how the fuck it happened,” he said.\nThe nature of the way robodebts were raised, the issuing of letters of notice without a contact phone number on the header, online forms that did not allow people to contest automated debts and the flawed formula used to generate them, and the agency’s preparedness to litigate against challengers — all add up to paint a David vs Goliath picture with the odds stacked terribly in favour against David.\nWhat Morton said he worries about most were issues also underscored by the APSC taskforce . He simply does not know what is needed to guarantee reform of a bureaucratic culture allowing public servants to demonstrate lack of curiosity and shrink from mistakes or cover them up.\n“The active disappearing of evidence when the ombud came knocking was incredible. I’d never seen anything like it, particularly from people who, yes, had made mistakes, but they weren’t the ones who came up with robodebt,” he said.\n“I genuinely didn’t think it was possible. I thought rules were always bent and that things were distorted all the time. I’d never thought I would see an outright lie to an independent statutory authority.”\nBuilding a picture of how robodebt was allowed to stand up, and wrapping a narrative around it makes one keenly aware of the insidious public service cultural rot .\nIt also gives journalists like Morton a unique insight into how otherwise well-meaning public servants, who give an inch here or cut corners there, acting across the system can contribute to the ‘look away’ and ‘don’t probe too much’ environment robodebt thrived in.\n“There’s one very senior person who was involved in robodebt going ‘Oh yeah, I thought I did a good job until the royal commission, and then I realised maybe I could do some things better.’ That’s a nice thing to realise, because they weren’t a bad person,” Morton said.\n“But then they were like, ‘It’s really hard though, because what do they want us to do? Go into the secretary’s office and say we’ve got legal advice advising this scheme’s illegal?’ Yes — we do want you to do this. It is your job!”\nREAD MORE:\nRobodebt reverse charges: Dreyfus puts burden of proof back on APS",
