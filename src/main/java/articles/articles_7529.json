    "title": "翻鳄鱼围栏自拍游客险被撕碎！愚蠢决定竟是因为：我以为它是雕像-快科技-科技改变生活",
    "text": "4月28日，一名29岁的男性游客在参观菲律宾一动物园时，做出了“愚蠢”的行为：\n他爬过铁丝网，趟过水，慢慢靠近“鳄鱼雕像”，然后笑嘻嘻拿出自己的手机，准备自拍。\n没成想，这条15 英尺长（约4.6米）“鳄鱼雕像”突然动了，向男子猛扑了过来，差点将其撕碎。\n“这鳄鱼一动不动的，不是塑料模型吗？怎么还是活的？”\n原来，男子之所以如此大胆，是因为他误把真鳄鱼当作了“鳄鱼雕像”。\n这条鳄鱼叫拉莱 (Lalay)，是一只雌性鳄鱼，面对男人的“挑衅行为”，它做出了自己正确的反应。\n男子一靠近，就一口咬住了他的手臂，吓得围观群众惊恐尖叫，大喊男子赶紧离开那里。\n然而，一旦被鳄鱼咬住，哪能这么容易就逃脱了。\n接下来的一幕就很恐怖了，男子就像洋娃娃一样，被鳄鱼甩来甩去，长达30分钟。\n期间，鳄鱼突然松嘴放开了男子的手臂，男子还以为鳄鱼要放过自己了。\n结果下一秒，鳄鱼咬住了他的大腿，实行了鳄鱼擅长的“死亡翻滚”，试图将其杀死。\n翻滚时，为了大腿不被“扯下”，男子只能心如死灰跟着鳄鱼一起翻转。\n由于水比较浅，男子体型比较大，死亡翻滚无法完成一圈，只能完成180°，男子和鳄鱼在水里左边翻转，右边翻转，心都提到嗓子眼了。\n直到鳄鱼拉莱的饲养员到场，事情才有了转机。\n饲养员，冒着生命危险爬进围栏，试图命令鳄鱼松口，但鳄鱼没有照做，最后据说是饲养员将一块水泥砸在鳄鱼头上，鳄鱼才被迫松开男子。\n随后男子被送往医院救治，幸运的是，他活下来了，只是缝了50多针，腿没断，手也没断。\n事情发生后，人们纷纷谴责男子太愚蠢。\n“动物园里，还有假的鳄鱼？这脑子……”\n还有人调侃：“那我们去野生动物园一起欣赏‘雕像’吧！”\n还有人支招：“被咬住的时候，就应该用手指戳鳄鱼的眼睛，鳄鱼疼了才会放开你。”\n一动不动，是鳄鱼的习惯\n不过撇开以上这个场景，鳄鱼在现实中，确实是一座非常好的活“雕像”。它完全可以做到2个小时一动不动，这是它狩猎的一种手段。\n鳄鱼是伏击型捕食者，采用隐身、伏击的捕食策略。\n首先，它会选择一块适合于隐身的位置，然后一动不动地待上几个小时，等待放松警惕的猎物靠近。\n等时机合适，鳄鱼迅速发起攻击，一口咬住猎物，捕猎效率很高。\n平时不狩猎的时候，鳄鱼也会保持静止状态，此时的鳄鱼只是为了节省能量。\n尤其是温度比较低的天气，作为冷血动物，鳄鱼是要靠晒太阳来获取能量的。显然不动，对它更有利。\n因此，可以说，鳄鱼天生是“不爱动”的，也正是鳄鱼“一动不动”的形象，过去还闹出过乌龙事件。\n2024年2月，美国亚利桑那州的一个公园里，有人频频报警，说河里有鳄鱼，大约11英尺长。\n但事实上，这个鳄鱼是假的，由泡沫制成，是人为放到水里的。\n据园方表示，放置这些假动物，是为了方便海龟和鸟上去晒太阳，晚上也有地方让它们休息，后期，还在湖里放了假河马。\n最后\n类似的事情，在2021年也发生过，同样是在菲律宾一家游乐园。\n一名60岁的男子生日去主题公园玩，看到鳄鱼池，也以为鳄鱼是仿品，于是便爬到围栏下方位置，近距离靠近这尊一动不动的“雕像”，并摸了摸它的头。\n刚碰到鳄鱼，鳄鱼也咬住了他的左臂，幸运的是，这名男子迅速跳出了水面，也是缝了几针。\n所以说，鳄鱼擅长当“雕塑”，一动不动，不一定就是假鳄鱼，但如果有围栏，一定要记住，不要冒险去靠近。\n怪罗科普",

    "text": "A NSW berry farm has grown the world's heaviest blueberry. Weighing 20.40 grams and measuring 39.31 millimetres, the fruit has officially broken the [Guinness World Record title](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-blueberry) set in 2020 by a 16.20 gram Western Australian blueberry. The record-breaking blueberry was picked at Costa Berries' farm in Corindi, on the Mid North Coast, in November 2023 and grown by Brad Hocking, Jessica Scalzo and Marie-France Courtois. Mr Hocking said the blueberry was from the Eterna variety which is known for its large fruit size, crisp texture and long shelf life. \"When we picked this one there were probably around 20 other berries of a similar size,\" he said. \"This really is a delightful piece of fruit. \"While the fruit is large, there's absolutely no compromise on quality or flavour as would be expected when developing a premium variety blueberry.\" The Costa Group said its variety improvement program develops one or two new varieties of blueberries on average each year. It licenses Costa bred varieties overseas such as the Americas, Morocco, China and south east Africa. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data.
