    "text": "HANCEVILLE — During the late stages of the game Thursday morning, the Hartselle girls basketball team never batted an eye.\nFacing off against Muscle Shoals in the first round of the Class 6A Northwest Regional tournament, the Tigers found themselves in a battle late in the game.\nLike all great teams do though, Hartselle made the shots when it mattered and it resulted in a 50-46 win.\n\"When you get to this level you have to find ways to win,\" said Hartselle head coach Amber Deline. \"These girls know how to fight when their backs are against the wall and today proved that.\"\nHartselle stayed in comfortable control for the first three quarters, building a 35-25 lead late in the third. However, an 11-0 run by Muscle Shoals gave the Trojans their first lead early in the fourth and forced Hartselle into a timeout.\n\"We were rattled and we just needed to calm down,\" Deline said.\nAfter that, Hartselle continually made clutch shot after shot until it ended with Anna Hampton Burroughs sinking two free throws with eight seconds remaining to seal the win.\nFreshman Hannah Burks led the Tigers in scoring with 17 points, while junior Gracie Hill added 15. Junior Mary Frances Itsede had a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nThree-point shooting was key for the Tigers in Thursday's game and started in the opening minutes of the game when Hill pulled up from behind the men's college 3-point line and swished a shot.\n\"'I'm not going to lie, I was surprised when it went in,\" Hill said with a laugh. \"I guess it was the adrenaline.\"\n\"When she shot it I was thinking 'oh no,' but then she made it so I was like, 'Alright, let's go,'\" Deline added.\nTom Drake Coliseum at Wallace State is notorious for being a tough place to shoot, but Hartselle finished 7 for 14 from beyond the arch, with four of those coming from Hill. It was the most 3 pointers by any team in the Northwest Regional tournament so far this season.\n\"When we got there the first thing Coach Deline had us do was practice form shooting,\" Hill said. \"This is a different place and you have to focus and keep your mind on the goal. Just think it's as big as a normal gym.\"\nWith the win Hartselle advances to the Regional finals for the first time since 2021. The Tigers will face the winner of Class 6A, No. 1 Hazel Green and No. 2 Clay-Chalkville on Tuesday at 9 a.m.",

(WIFR) - The LZ Peace group welcomes veterans and their families to the Purple Heart Memorial unveiling event. The [Purple Heart](https://purpleheartfoundation.org/), created in 1782 by George Washington, is a U.S. military decoration awarded to those wounded or killed in action. Military member that are bestowed with a Purple Heart medal are recognized to have greatly sacrificed themselves, or paid the ultimate price while in the line of duty. On Saturday, Sgt. Nick Parnello and his squadron held an unveiling ceremony and gifted replicas of the memorial to Purple Heart veterans at the Midway Village LZ Peace Memorial, 6595 Guilford Road. “Today was a very, very special day, and it was certainly special to those veterans who received a Purple Heart,” LZ Peace President Nick Parnello says. “Today we were able to meet with those Purple Heart veterans, and we had General Jorge out to honor them... It was a special ceremony.” The LZ Peace group has worked to bring the ceremony to fruition for almost two years, noting the LZ Purple Heart Memorial to be the first in the midwest.

    "title": "Can Avocado’s Wool Mattress Help You Sleep Cool?",
    "text": "Can Avocado’s Wool Mattress Help You Sleep Cool?\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nI have terrible sleep temperature regulation. In fact, I have terrible body temperature regulation in general (hello, Raynaud’s), but it’s especially uncomfortable when it interferes with my sleep. I’m prone to burning up at night and waking up hot and stuffy in the morning. But in the winter, I can hardly get warm enough, even after going to bed in a full sweatsuit and socks underneath my comforter. It’s exhausting, literally.\nTo try and help with my sleep woes, I decided to test Avocado’s Alpaca Wool Mattress Toppers. Wool is a great temperature regulator, keeping you cool when it’s warm and warm when it’s cool. This topper is also made with GOTS-certified organic cotton and natural, ethically sourced alpaca wool—the two-inch thick toppers add what the brand calls a “decadently soft” layer to your bed.\nWhile I chose Avocado’s wool mattress topper for its temperature regulation and because I didn’t want to completely change the feel of my relatively new mattress, the brand has four other topper options. The latex topper is made of both latex and wool for a squishier feel, the vegan topper replaces that wool with cotton, the luxury topper is thicker for a more plush, lux feel, and the eco topper is similar to the vegan topper but at their most affordable price point.\nAll toppers come in six sizes: twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king. Most come in two models: a more plush version or a firmer option, depending on your preferred feel. I opted for the queen-size wool topper in the “standard” model, which is more firm than the “luxury plush” option.\nDelivery & Setup\nThe topper was wrapped in recyclable plastic inside a cardboard box and delivered to my front door. The package was huge, but, fortunately, the topper was super light—I had no problem carrying it up the stairs to my apartment. After unrolling it from the packaging, the topper was ready to go straight onto the bed—no inflation time necessary.\n“After unrolling it from the packaging, the topper was ready to go straight onto the bed—no inflation time necessary.”\nThe four stretchy straps kept it in place on the bed, and it was super easy to put on. The brand recommends putting your mattress protector over the topper, then adding your fitted sheet. The short two-inch height of the topper meant that my normal fitted sheet fit just fine over everything.\nOne note: The topper has a fairly strong alpaca wool smell at first, which is an earthy, barnyard-y scent. The smell was subtle but noticeable, especially on my clothes after waking up in the morning. If you’re sensitive to scents, I recommend airing out the topper in a well-ventilated area if you have the space for a few days before throwing it on the bed.\nIs The Avocado Mattress Topper Comfortable?\nI already love the feel of my mattress—I’d rate it about a six on a scale from firm to soft—and I didn’t want any major changes to the mattress feel. The wool topper in the “standard” model worked perfectly for me, adding just a hair of welcome firmness to an otherwise pretty plushy sleeping situation. If you’re looking to soften up a mattress that’s too firm, I’d opt for the wool topper in the “luxury plush” model or the vegan or latex toppers in the “plush” option.\nFor the most part, I was super impressed with the topper’s temperature-regulating qualities. For the past two weeks since I put the topper on, the only two uncomfortable nights were during a couple of warm days in the apartment (the first few hot days of late spring, no A/C in yet, you know the drill). The wool topper certainly helps with temperature regulation, but it’s not magic. But almost every night lately, I’ve been waking up comfortable, not too hot like I used to. And I haven’t had to put on a sweatshirt on cooler nights.\nIs the Avocado Mattress Topper Worth It?\nAs a brand, Avocado has some pretty impressive brand stats, too. Founded in 2016, the California-based B-Corp is committed to 1% for the Planet and is Climate Neutral certified (and even carbon negative!). But they don’t stop there.\nThey started making certified organic green mattresses, specifically made from all-natural and nontoxic materials. They couldn’t find an affordable, eco-friendly mattress with transparent sourcing and materials—so they made their own.\nAvocado is the most vertically integrated mattress brand in the US, making all their mattresses at their low-waste California factory powered by renewable energy. They own some of their supply chains, too—they raise over 200,000 sheep in northern India, where they also own a GOTS organic certified wool factory, and they co-own 4,000 acres of latex farms and a latex processing facility.\nAlong with mattresses, the brand makes pillows, bedding, furniture, pajamas, yoga equipment, and bath accessories (check out reviews of the Eco Organic Mattress and the Organic Yoga Meditation Pillow).\nKey Takeaways:\n- Avocado is a sustainable mattress brand founded in 2016. They’re a certified\nB-Corp, areClimate Neutral certified, and are committed to1% for the Planet. They’re vertically integrated, and all their products are handmade at their California factory. - The Alpaca Wool Mattress Topper is one of five toppers that they carry. It comes in six sizes and two models: Standard or Luxury Plush. The wool topper is made of GOTS organic certified wool and GOTS organic certified cotton, and no latex.\n- It’s two inches thick, adds a layer of plush comfort to your bed, and helps regulate temperature—keeping you cool when it’s warm and warm when it’s cool. The topper has four elastic straps to keep it in place on your bed.\nTHIS STORY IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR FRIENDS AT AVOCADO\nNatalie Gale is a Boston-based freelance journalist.

    "title": "Pope Francis hails ‘immense gift’ of vocation to the consecrated life",
    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, May 30, 2024 / 16:30 pm (CNA). Pope Francis on Thursday addressed a message to participants in a conference on consecrated religious life currently taking place in Brazil. In his message, he expressed his gratitude for “the immense gift of the vocation to consecrated life which, in its most diverse charisms, enriches ecclesial communion and contributes greatly to the mission of the Church throughout the world.” The pontiff noted that in many places “the first proclamation of the Gospel is made by consecrated men and women, who take up with great commitment and with the dedication of their lives the mandate of the Lord.” The Holy Father also said that “the gift of vocation must be safeguarded and cultivated every day, so that it produces good fruits in the life of each religious.” Pope Francis expressed his joy for the theme chosen for the conference, which is the exhortation that Jesus made to the apostles at the Last Supper: “Remain in my love.” According to Pope Francis, “to live the divine call well, it is necessary to remain in his love, through constant dialogue with Jesus in daily prayer and fidelity to the vows that so beautifully express our consecration.” The pope also said that “the consecrated life, if it remains firm in the love of the Lord, sees beauty. It sees that poverty is not a titanic effort but rather a much greater freedom, which gives us God and others as true riches.” The consecrated life “sees that chastity is not austere sterility but the way to love without possessing. It sees that obedience is not discipline but victory over our unruliness as exemplified by Jesus,” he said, recalling his homily of Feb. 1, 2020, on the occasion of [the World Day of Consecrated Life.](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2020/documents/papa-francesco_20200201_omelia-vitaconsacrata.html) Finally, he encouraged the attendees to live the present “sustained by the mysticism of the specific charisms of each religious family and [by being] prophetically committed to the proclamation of the Gospel.” He also invited them to “look to the future with hope” and not to forget “to pray for me.” This story [was first published](https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/104690/papa-francisco-la-castidad-no-es-esterilidad-austera-sino-el-camino-para-amar-sin-poseer) by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.
