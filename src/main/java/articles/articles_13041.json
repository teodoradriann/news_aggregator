    "text": "After they both posted about the split, Stanley took to YouTube to detail what went wrong — and the message LaBelle allegedly sent him shortly after the breakup.\nThe tribe has spoken: Survivor star Bret LaBelle and YouTuber boyfriend Chris Stanley are over.\nThe pair, who reportedly started dating in 2022 and have a 27-year age gap, announced their split on social media Tuesday, in a pair of Instagram posts.\n“Sometimes love means letting go. Chris and I have shared so many memories, laughter, and growth together, and I will always be grateful for that,” wrote LaBelle, 51, in his post. “While our paths are now going in different directions, the care and respect remain. Wishing him nothing but happiness, love, and success on his journey. Thank you for the memories.”\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\nIn his own post, 25-year-old Stanley added, “Yes, we broke up. Some good things don’t last forever, but that doesn’t make them any less special.”\n“I’ll always be grateful for the memories and the love Bret and I shared,” he continued. “Wishing him all the happiness in the world as we move forward on our own paths.”\nThe two used the same photo in each of their posts revealing their breakup.\nAs Stanley is also a YouTuber with nearly 500K subscribers, he also took to his channel to open up a bit more about the split.\n“This isn’t the easiest or most fun video to make,” he began his video, saying the two actually broke up a few months ago.\nHe added that while he knows a lot of people will want to know “what exactly happened or what went wrong,” Stanley added that he wasn’t “really here to spill tea, point fingers or talk about some drama or some scandal, because nothing really happened.”\n“We’re still on good terms. I think maybe, eventually, when it’s not still fresh, I can talk about our relationship a little bit more,” he continued. “You only saw what was on social media, but obviously there’s more to it.”\nCBS\nEmotional Survivor Moment Brings Jeff Probst to Tears for First Time In 48 Seasons: ‘Never Happened Before’\nView Story\nStanley said that, for him, “what happened is we grew apart” — simply stating, “sometimes it just doesn’t work out and that’s okay.”\nAfter getting choked up, he also shared a text message LaBelle allegedly sent him a few days after they decided to break up. In it, the reality star purportedly wrote, “It sucks it took me 47 years to find a relationship this good and, for you, it’s your first. I’m gonna miss you, man.”\n“It does suck,” acknowledged Stanley. “Bret was my first serious relationship and it was great. I felt like we grew apart.” He ended the video telling fans they shouldn’t say “anything nasty to Bret” following their split, reiterating that the two are “still on good terms.”\nGetty 10 Celebrities Who Were On Game Shows Before Fame\nView Story\nContent shared from www.toofab.com .\nShare This Article",

    "text": "NATO allies putting in place foundations for Ukraine to prevail - Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this during the closing press conference at the end of the NATO Summit in Washington on Thursday, according to an Ukrinform correspondent. \"Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, NATO Allies have provided Ukraine with unprecedented support, including tens of billions of euros in military aid. Ukraine has had a difficult winter and spring. Gaps and delays in the provision of military support have had real consequences on the battlefield. And Ukrainians have shown remarkable courage and tenacity in holding the line. But we cannot and will not allow this to happen again. At this summit, we are turning the corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,\" he said. Stoltenberg noted that on Thursday, July 11, as part of the NATO-Ukraine Council, Allies had a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who opted them on the situation on the battlefield and Ukraine's most urgent needs. Stoltenberg recalled that during the summit, Allies have agreed to launch the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), with a command in Germany, logistics hubs in the alliance and around 700 personnel. [Pentagon: New aid package for Ukraine includes Patriot battery, munitions for HIMARS](/rubric-ato/3884467-pentagon-new-aid-package-for-ukraine-includes-patriot-battery-munitions-for-himars.html) NATO will also coordinate the training of Ukrainian forces at facilities in Allied countries, plan and coordinate the provision of donations, manage the transfer and repair of equipment and provide support to the long-term development of Ukraine's Armed Forces. \"Allies have also agreed a major financial pledge to Ukraine, with a minimum baseline of EUR 40 billion within the next year. And to sustain our support for Ukraine to prevail. We will review this level at forthcoming Summits to ensure that our support continues to meet Ukraine's needs,\" Stoltenberg said. He noted that the Europeans are more than matching the overall U.S. support for Ukraine. \"This pledge will ensure greater burden sharing of military support too. It will also provide Ukraine the reliable support it needs to deter and defend against future Russian aggression now and in the future,\" Stoltenberg said. In addition, he said, at the Summit Allies have made further announcements of immediate military aid including critical air defense, and more Allies have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine bringing the total to more than 20. Allies have taken further steps to deepen Ukraine's interoperability with NATO, bolster Ukraine's defense industry and enhance cooperation on innovation, he added. Allies also agreed to establish NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Center in Poland. All of this support will make Ukraine stronger and more capable. \"In fact, everything we are doing - the command, the pledge, more military aid, more security agreements, and improved interoperability put in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail. They serve as a bridge to NATO. Allies have agreed that as Ukraine continues necessary reforms, we will support them on the irreversible path to membership,\" Stoltenberg said. He noted that today Allies sent a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that \"violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now and for the long haul.\"",

Photographers can't stop themselves from capturing the beautiful sky colors. The reason 2024 has been so active for aurora viewing is because we are in the peak of an 11-year cycle of solar activity. The last time we were in the midst of such a cycle, neither cell phones nor social media were as prevalent. These days, word about an aurora display spreads quickly online, and most of us are armed with a phone camera that, when pointed to the night sky, can quickly make out the shimmering curtains of colors that our naked eye cannot. For all northern lights viewing, the best experience is in dark areas away from the city light pollution to the north. A camera lens will better pick up the waving colors in the night sky. Our brilliant aurora shows begin about 93 million miles away on the surface of the sun. At times, a sunspot cluster will erupt into a complex called a “solar storm,” emitting huge bursts of energy in the form of flares and expulsions of magnetic field and plasma. These bursts are known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. The CMEs pull away from the sun and hurl into space. The size, speed, and strength of a CME can vary greatly. CMEs typically arrive at Earth in three to five days, but the fastest have been found to reach our planet in as little as 15 to 18 hours! Once here, the ejected energy and plasma, and the embedded magnetic field, interacts with our earth’s atmosphere. This disruption results in an exchange of energy from the solar wind into our earth’s magnetosphere, and is known as a ‘Geomagnetic Storm.’ How are solar storm strengths rated? The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The [SWPC ](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)keeps track of solar flares and geomagnetic storms and has developed a scale similar to those for hurricanes and tornadoes, so as to keep tabs on these disturbances and communicate their intensity to the public. Part of the scale is based on a ‘K’ index, sometimes called a ‘Planetary-K’ index, stylized as “Kp.” This reading quantifies the horizontal movement in the earth’s magnetic field over three-hour intervals, with 0 being totally calm (marked by green), and five or more indicating a geomagnetic storm is occurring (marked by red). The top of the scale is 9, reflecting an extreme storm. The colors, intensity, shape, and coverage of an aurora borealis event correlate to the Kp index as such: Kp0 means we might see faint green, from Kp3 we might see some yellows, Kp4 brings pink, Kp5 brings blue and purple, and at Kp8 red becomes part of the mix. Thus, greens are common with lower Kp values, but the blues, purples, and red become visible in only more intense Geomagnetic storms. In the severe Geomagnetic storm that occurred in May of 2024, SWPC’s planetary K-index showed that the Kp index reached between 8 and 9 in the early morning hours of May 11. While the Kp index measures the movement in the magnetic field, the overall impacts of a geomagnetic storm, including disruptions to power grids, GPS, and communications systems, are also measured by SWPC, with the ‘G scale.’ The scale goes from G1-G5, with G1 corresponding to Kp5 and G5 to a Kp9. G5 storms are rare. Until the massive rounds of aurora borealis in May of 2024, a G5 storm hadn’t been observed since 2003. Because severe geomagnetic storms have the potential to affect global navigation satellite systems, scientists work to understand how to improve those systems during such storms. Green northern lights are by far the most common. They become visible when the oxygen in the lower atmosphere gets excited by the changes in the magnetosphere. Reds are generally only seen in the higher latitudes (think of all of those brilliant pinks and reds you’ve seen photographed in northern Europe) unless the solar storm is very intense. Similarly, blues and purples are more rare, and only show themselves in the stronger solar storms. Blue aurora is the result of ionized nitrogen molecules. The [aurora breakout of May 2024](https://komonews.com/news/local/gallery/northern-lights-aurora-borealis-western-washington-seattle-north-central-tips-when-where-how-may-2024-us-space-weather-prediction-center-severe-geomagnetic-storm-solar-event-nws-best-places-to-see?photo=2) led to the visibility of the entire aurora spectrum in the mid-latitudes. CMEs—and thus, the resultant “Northern Lights,” are fairly common. Social media has made that apparent, as even photographers in Western Washington (not just Norway and Finland!) are able to capture them several times a year, sharing documentation on X, YouTube, and other platforms. In order to see the aurora borealis, you’ll have the best luck if: SkunkBayWeather.com sits on a property at the very northern reach of the Kitsap Peninsula, and its [north-facing webcams capture](https://x.com/Skunkbayweather/status/1844607505093230911) the Northern Lights on a regular basis. However, geomagnetic storms aren’t often strong enough such that the Northern Lights are visible all throughout the United States. The G5 level storm in 2024 resulted in an aurora observed as far south as California and Florida. Usually at our latitude, only the fainter greens are easy to spot. During the May 2024 solar storm, many Washingtonians were amazed by the waving curtains of pinks and purples in the mix, too. While the naked eye cannot see the full range of colors in the night sky, personal cameras, including those on mobile phones, were able to capture the brilliant colors of the aurora borealis in Iceland and Alaska, and also right here in Western Washington. Your camera lens can pick up far more color and light than the lens of your eye, especially if it’s set up with a long exposure. This tip is often communicated by broadcasters and NWS meteorologists, so as to keep everyone’s expectations within reason.",

    "title": "From Gaza to Ukraine the IRC highlights women at frontlines of crisis, this International Women's Day | International Rescue Committee (IRC)",
    "text": "London, United Kingdom, March 7, 2024 — This International Women’s Day, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) highlights the [critical role of women](https://www.rescue.org/international-womens-day) who step up to provide crucial services and support to people and communities in crises. In Gaza, of the 1.9 million people displaced, close to one million are women and girls. During crises, girls and women are impacted disproportionately, pushing them to the brink of survival. Conflict worsens their exposure to coercion or violence while gender inequality hinders access to humanitarian services like food, safe water, shelter, and healthcare. In overcrowded shelters, the lack of adequate facilities exacerbates vulnerabilities, such as privacy and safety concerns, health risks, and hygiene and sanitation challenges. The safety and dignity of girls and women are compromised in the absence of secure and separate spaces. Access to water, feminine products, and personal hygiene and sanitation products are scarce, further affecting the well-being of girls and women. In Gaza, malnutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women are a significant concern, as functioning health systems and food security deteriorate. There are an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, with over 180 giving birth every day. These women have to give birth in the few remaining and overwhelmed healthcare facilities, in dangerously overcrowded shelters, or even in the streets among rubble. As access to food and water worsen, mothers continue to struggle to feed themselves and their families. Throughout these catastrophic challenges, women’s rights organisations in Gaza continue to operate. But as with many national organisations, their own staff are displaced, their families struggling, and the majority of their physical infrastructure has been destroyed. As the war reaches its fifth month the IRC is calling on the UK government and international community to work urgently to establish an [immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza ](https://www.rescue.org/uk/press-release/urgent-action-needed-prevent-starvation-gaza-irc-and-map-call-immediate-ceasefire-and)as the only sustainable way to protect civilian lives.This will ensure that the IRC and our partners can safely deliver critical humanitarian supplies, such as dignity kits for women, and help to rebuild the protection and health services women and girls depend upon, such as safe spaces, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), Sexual and Reproductive Health, and Maternal and Newborn Health. Denisa Delić, Director of Advocacy, International Rescue Committee UK, said, “From Gaza to Ukraine, women and girls suffer disproportionately in crisis settings, facing an increased risk of gender-based violence and specific barriers to accessing life-saving aid. In parallel, women are pivotal to any humanitarian response - not only in their understanding of the fundamental needs of their communities, but in their ability to provide critical services. Against this backdrop, on International Women’s Day, the IRC is once again calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and for a fundamental shift to a feminist crisis response. In recognition of their unique expertise and experience, the UK government must prioritise meaningful inclusion of women’s rights and women-led organisations in programme design and strategic decision making, while ensuring access to quality funding. On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to elevating the women who fight for a more equitable world for women and girls in crisis.\" Dr. Seema Jilani, paediatrician with the IRC, recently worked alongside Palestinian doctors and health care staff at Al Aqsa Hospital in Gaza, said, “The women in particular, showed an immeasurable strength amid unimaginably horrifying situations, whether giving birth in inhumane circumstances, breastfeeding their newborn babies amid bombings, or trying to save diapers by changing them less often because of the lack of supplies, comforting their wounded children, or, in the most tragic cases, burying them. They are pillars of strength holding up their communities, and amongst the health care staff, their work ethic is unparalleled.” Seda Akpinar Manla Nassan, the IRC’s Early Childhood and Development Coordinator, added, “Women serve their communities in pivotal ways during humanitarian crises, many times at the forefront of relief efforts. Aid workers in Gaza are working through their own displacement, constant danger, dwindling food, water, and supplies, including medicine, and having lost their loved ones. Women bring a unique perspective, addressing specific needs and challenges faced by women and children. Recognising and empowering women in humanitarian efforts is not only a matter of gender equality but also an imperative for achieving more comprehensive and effective crisis response.” Notes to Editors Read about the work of IRC’s women volunteers, staff, and clients [here](https://www.rescue.org/international-womens-day), this International Women’s Day.",

    "title": "\"Destruir a Rússia\"? \"Os nossos adversários não foram bem sucedidos\"",
    "text": "O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, afirmou, esta segunda-feira, que os seus \"adversários\" Ocidentais, que tinham o objetivo de \"destruir a Rússia\", não foram \"bem sucedidos\", numa referência às sanções impostas ao país devido à invasão à Ucrânia.\nEsta posição foi partilhada por Putin numa reunião com membros do governo.\n\"Nós sabemos muito bem o que aconteceu do ponto de vista económico. Literalmente, no sentido mais verdadeiro da palavra, começaram a agressão económica contra a Rússia\", começou por dizer o chefe de Estado russo, de acordo com a agência estatal russa TASS.\n\"O número infindável de sanções que enfrentámos tinha um único objetivo e todos sabemos muito bem qual era o objetivo: destruir a Rússia a partir do seu interior. E não só politicamente, mas sobretudo a nível económico. As sanções destinavam-se a criar problemas nas equipas de trabalho, a causar desemprego em massa no país, a levar ao encerramento de empresas e indústrias inteiras. Os nossos adversários não foram bem sucedidos\", declarou.\nPutin defendeu ainda que as sanções tiveram o resultado \"exatamente oposto do que se esperava\" e que, no ano passado, a economia do país \"cresceu a um ritmo superior ao da economia mundial\".\nRecorde-se que, no passado mês de abril, o Ministério do Desenvolvimento Económico anunciou que a economia russa tinha crescido 5,4% no primeiro trimestre deste ano face ao mesmo período de 2023.\nO crescimento do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), que tinha atingido 4,8% em janeiro e 7,6% em fevereiro, desacelerou para 4,2% em março, segundo o relatório do ministério.\nO Ministério da Economia melhorou as previsões de crescimento de 2,3% para 2,8%, enquanto o Banco Central russo elevou as suas de um intervalo entre 1 e 2% para 2,5 a 3,5%.\nO Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI) elevou, recentemente, a previsão de crescimento da Rússia em seis décimos de ponto percentual, para 3,2%, graças ao desempenho positivo das suas exportações de petróleo.\nO FMI considera que a economia russa fortaleceu-se porque os volumes de exportação de petróleo permaneceram estáveis devido ao comércio estabelecido com países não alinhados com as sanções ocidentais.\nTambém no início de abril, o primeiro-ministro russo, Mikhail Mishustin, sublinhou que o PIB tinha crescido 3,6% no ano passado, apesar do aumento das pressões externas, aludindo às sanções ocidentais impostas devido à guerra lançada por Moscovo na Ucrânia.\nLeia Também: Moscovo convoca embaixador francês contra \"provocações\" de Macron",
