    "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is set to split into two companies by separating its legacy cable business from its streaming and studios operations. This split is also delivering a heavy blow to CEO David Zaslav , as his salary is set to be reduced following the move. However, his new compensation includes attractive stock options that could be worth more than $150 million if the company reaches certain share price milestones.\nConfident Investing Starts Here: Easily unpack a company's performance with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter\nThe new pay structure will take effect only if the split is completed by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, Zaslav received stock options for 21 million shares last week, with the underlying value already exceeding $200 million. Zaslav is considered one of the highest-paid CEOs on Wall Street, and while making the decision to split the company, the board insisted that Zaslav continue as CEO of the streaming and studios unit.\nZaslav’s Salary Hit by Company Split According to the new pay structure, Zaslav will continue to earn $3 million in regular salary, but his target bonus will be significantly reduced to $6 million, down from the $22 million target bonus he had last year. The new bonus will have a cap of $12 million, nearly half of the $23.9 million payout he earned last year.\nAdditionally, the CEO would receive $15.5 million in equity awards in the first year after the split, followed by $7.5 million annually thereafter. If Zaslav remains in his role, 40% of the options would vest over five years, with the rest vesting in tranches. Notably, if all milestones are met, he could earn more than $150 million in shares from the grant over the five-year period. Moreover, Zaslav’s stock options would continue to vest even if the streaming business is sold or if Zaslav is asked to leave.\nThe media giant made the bold decision to split its business because the legacy cable TV division was dragging down overall performance. The split will result in the creation of two publicly listed entities , with the studios and HBO Max streaming division separating from its cable networks. Last week, WBD’s bondholders approved the split by a majority vote. Under the new structure, most of the outstanding debt will be tied to the cable business, while the streaming and studio units will take on less debt to better compete in the market.\nIs WBD Stock a Good Investment? Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on 10 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average WBD price target of $12.31 per share implies 16.3% upside potential from current levels.\nSee more WBD analyst ratings\nDisclaimer & Disclosure Report an Issue",

    "title": "Hardy Islanders brave record-cold temperatures with outdoor walks — and even swims",
    "text": "It might be frightfully cold outside, but Java still needs to do his business three times a day. The 14-year-old Shih Tzu/Maltese/Yorkshire Terrier cross was walking as briskly as his short legs would take him Thursday afternoon along the Songhees walkway, heading home as the thermometer hovered around -10 C and a brisk breeze added to the wind chill. “He doesn’t seem to mind the weather,” said Brian Skillen, his two-legged companiont. “I think that he is pleased because there is no snow today.” Although it was unusually cold for Greater Victoria, Skillen said during Java’s first winter, they were in Ontario, where temperatures dropped to -25. Friday’s frigid weather set several all-time-low records at locations around the Island. It was -10.7 C at Victoria International Airport, which beat the 1963 record of -9.4 C , while the weather station at Gonzales recorded the coldest temperature there in 55 years at -11.5 C. The low on the Malahat was -13.4 C, down from a record of -8.4 C in 2007. Nanaimo’s low of -10.3 C tied a record set in 1998. While the wind chill in Greater Victoria made it feel closer to -21 C, the temperature in the waters around Victoria stayed a relatively balmy 5 to 6 C, so Monir Moussa was game to jump into the ocean for his usual early-morning swim. “Getting into the water is the easy part, as it is warmer than the air,” said Moussa, who has been going for ocean swims for the last three years. “The hard part today was coming out. My hands were frozen in minutes. It was the coldest I have experienced for some time.” Moussa, who moved to B.C. from Ontario 10 years ago, meets up with a group of other hardy souls who call themselves the Fernwood Social Reptile Club, an offshoot of the Fernwood Social Run Club. He estimates there are close to 50 people who take to the water daily, regardless of the weather, including about five who swim in lakes. “Those are the swimmers who would have to break the ice before they can take their swim. They take the activity to a whole different level,” said the 30-year-old, whose most memorable swim was when he was surrounded by a large bloom of moon jellyfish as they were spawning. “There must have been hundreds of thousands of them.” It may have been cold and windy on Friday, but for Dave Willett, who was out for his usual walk on the Songhees with his wife, Lori, it pales in comparison with his time on patrol in the open water in the Navy. “I have lived all across the country and I believe that Victoria still has the best climate,” said Willett. He said the two,who are in their 60s, walk up to four hours almost every day — their only concession to the unusual cold on Friday was cutting the walk to two and a half hours, although they were looking forward to a hot cup of coffee at the end of it. Katey Sater, meanwhile, was the picture of contentment sitting on a bench on the Songhees walkway Friday, soaking up the sun and a brisk ocean breeze in a fur-lined hooded down-filled jacket. “This is the best,” said Sater, 42, who moved to Victoria seven years ago. “I used to live in Abbotsford and it was a 20-minute drive to get anywhere. Here, I am close to the ocean and I can be downtown in three minutes.” Colder-than-normal weather is expected through Saturday around the Island, although highs could rise above freezing by early next week. Environment Canada meteorologist Lisa Erven said snow is likely now out of the picture on the Island, with Victoria, Duncan, Nanaimo and Port Alberni expected to have sun and cold temperatures through the weekend. Erven said the Malahat had two centimetres of snow by Friday morning, North Cowichan had 10 cm and Nanaimo had nine cm. “Now that the arctic front’s passed through, we’re just basically into a frigid, dry air mass,” she said. Snow could again be a possibility early next week, Erven said. Despite snow accumulating in some areas, schools on south Vancouver Island opened as usual Friday, although there were some bus [cancellations and detours in the Sooke School ](https://www.sd62.bc.ca/our-district/transportation) [District](https://www.sd62.bc.ca/our-district/transportation). In Saanich, the Churchill Drive gate to PKOLS (Mount Douglas Park) was closed to vehicle access at least through Sunday due to the freezing conditions. Emcon Services, the highway-maintenance contractor for the south Island, said it didn’t encounter any major issues Friday. “It’s pretty much bared off — there’s a few slippery sections,” operations manager Andrew Gaetz said Friday morning. B.C. Transit said most of its buses in the Victoria Regional Transit System were running on their usual routes Friday, although icy roads in parts of Langford and Sooke led to some partial detours Friday on routes in the West Shore. parrais@timescolonist.com jbell@timescolonist.com",

    "text": "Os ministros da Educação da CPLP reúnem-se sexta-feira em São Tomé e Príncipe, devendo aprovar o Plano de Ação de Cooperação Multilateral em Educação 2025-2026 (PACE), com planos para mobilizar ajudas de observadores associados e organizações internacionais.\n\"Esta é uma matéria que tem vindo a ser debatida, não apenas no contexto desta reunião ministerial mas também de outras e que se prende com alguma preocupação com o financiamento que internacionalmente está disponível para ir ao encontro de questões que dizem respeito à agenda 2030 para o desenvolvimento sustentável, onde as questões da educação são primordiais\", explicou, em declarações à Lusa, o diretor de cooperação da Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa (CPLP), Manuel Lapão.\nA mobilização de parcerias institucionais para a execução do PACE 2025-2026 será um dos temas centrais da reunião ministerial, que debaterá a possibilidade de organizações como União Europeia, Banco Mundial, Programa Alimentar Mundial, Unesco, Organização dos Estados Ibero-Americanos, mas também os países observadores consultivos da comunidade bem como entidades da sociedade civil darem o seu contributo para os projetos da educação, segundo a agenda do encontro a que a Lusa teve acesso.\n\"Há um conjunto de parceiros internacionais com quem gostaríamos de trabalhar\" nesta área, sublinhou Manuel Lapão.\nAlém disso, os ministros devem aprovar o relatório sobre o cumprimento do plano de ação da cooperação multilateral em educação do período 2022-2024 \"com um grau de execução muito elevado, de 80%\", revelou.\nA reunião deverá contar, na sessão de abertura, com as intervenções das ministras da Educação de Angola, Maria Luísa Alves Grilo, na qualidade de representante da presidência cessante da CPLP, e da Educação Ciência e Cultura de São Tomé e Príncipe, Isabel Viegas de Abreu, em representação da presidência em exercício daquela organização, que está desde agosto de 2023 sob a liderança do seu país, e que em julho, na próxima Cimeira de Chefes de Estado e de Governo, passará para a Guiné-Bissau.\nNa agenda inicial, estava prevista também a intervenção presencial na sessão de abertura do secretário executivo da CPLP, Zacarias da Costa, que, por motivos de agenda, não vai estar presente e enviará uma vídeo mensagem.\nAlguns ministros previstos na agenda inicial poderão não estar presentes, como é o caso do ministro do Brasil, Camilo Sobreira de Santana, que se fará representar pela vice-ministra Sara Figueiredo, faltando, nas vésperas do encontro, várias confirmações oficiais.\nPara Manuel Lapão, o importante é que as pessoas por quem os ministros se façam representar \"tenham plenos poderes para decidir\", embora admita que, para \"um debate político\", seria \"o ideal\" ter os ministros presentes.\nNa quarta-feira, dois dias antes da reunião ministerial, decorreu o II Fórum Internacional da CPLP sobre Cooperação em matéria de Educação, cuja primeira edição se realizou durante o mandato da presidência angolana.\nNesta segunda edição \"pretende-se que os Estados-membros da CPLP possam, por via dos respetivos agentes de educação, ter maior acesso às oportunidades de intercâmbio disponíveis a nível das Organizações Internacionais\", referem documentos da organização do evento.\n\"Esta tem sido uma tarefa desafiante, tendo em conta os condicionalismos da língua portuguesa, que não constitui língua de trabalho em muitos destes organismos internacionais\", salientam.\n\"Assim, torna-se imperativo que a CPLP promova uma maior aproximação a estas Organizações, a fim de permitir um crescente interconhecimento e a identificação de pontos de convergência que contribuam para a viabilização dos programas e projetos inscritos\" no PACE 2025-2026, lê-se no documento a que a Lusa teve acesso.",

    "text": "Natural England in partnership with Clinton Devon Estates declares new extension to Pebblebed Heaths National Nature Reserve. This launch is third in new King’s Series of National Nature Reserves which promote natural connections and biodiversity. Sees 90ha of wetland in the lower Otter valley join rare heathland at the Pebblebed Heaths NNR (declared in 2021) to become a much larger area for nature. Natural England and landowners Clinton Devon Estates today announce the extension to a National Nature Reserve neighbouring Budleigh Salterton, making the Otter Estuary Nature Reserve the third in the new King’s Series of National Nature Reserves.\nThe Otter Estuary becomes the latest in the “King’s Series” celebrating the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and leaving a lasting public legacy for people and nature.\nNational Nature Reserves are the crown jewels of England’s natural heritage. The King’s Series of National Nature Reserves will see five major National Nature Reserves named every year for the next five years - 25 in total. NNRs share a commitment to seeing England’s nature restored, enriched and reconnected to people.\nThe NNR extension brings together the existing 1159ha Pebblebed Heaths NNR, a nationally important lowland heathland managed by the Pebblebed Heaths Conservation Trust (PHCT), RSPB and Devon Wildlife Trust, along with a further 90ha of wetland at the nearby Otter Estuary, cared for by the PHCT on behalf of Clinton Devon Estates.\n50 ha of the newly declared area is inter-tidal habitat created as part of the recently completed Lower Otter Restoration Project (LORP).\nThe climate change adaptation project has seen major works along the lower Otter valley, reconnecting the river with its floodplain. Following a 70m breach of an embankment last September, the land is now tidal for the first time in 200 years, making space for nature while safeguarding local infrastructure.\nThe reserve is becoming increasingly important for rare and declining wetland birds, particularly waders including oystercatcher, curlew, godwits, avocet, and plovers. Rarer sightings include grey phalarope, spoonbill, green and wood sandpiper, glossy Ibis, ruff and osprey. Water rail and warblers including Cetti’s warbler also breed here.\nThe reintroduction of tidal flows is allowing the habitat to develop, transitioning to mudflat and saltmarsh. A range of visiting bird species make use of the increased area to feed. The appearance of each new species or familiar birds in larger numbers has delighted wildlife watchers.\nThe Pebblebed Heaths NNR lies within the East Devon National Landscape, while the new Otter Estuary reserve also forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the Otter Estuary Marine Conservation Zone. The heaths and new wetland share Triassic geology, a key feature of the entire NNR. The spectacular red sandstone cliffs of the estuary form the oldest part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, with Otter Head being part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\nWell connected to the town and local villages, in excess of 250,00 local people and visitors enjoy the Otter Estuary nature reserve each year using the network of footpaths which run through it, including part of the South West Coast path.\nStrong beaver and otter populations exist on the River Otter and the estuary supports populations of sea trout, Atlantic salmon and European eel. Restoration works during the LORP project has enhanced the ability of fish and other wildlife to move between the Pebblebed Heaths (the source of four tributaries of the River Otter) and the sea. Marine species such as bass, goby, pollock, flounder and thin-lipped mullet are also abundant within the Otter Estuary.\nTony Juniper, Chair of Natural England, said:\nThe extension of the Pebblebed Heaths National Nature Reserve to encompass the River Otter restoration project is a huge step for nature recovery, not just in Devon but the country as a whole, with new wetland habitat protected for nature.\nThe Otter estuary restoration shows how we can work with nature to deliver multiple benefits such as climate change adaptation while supporting internationally important wildlife.\nThis ambitious extension to the National Nature Reserve will not only enhance the natural environment, making it a better and more joined up place for wildlife to thrive, but also provide opportunities for locals and visitors alike to connect with the natural world, history and the local heritage.\nDr Sam Bridgewater, Director of Environment Strategy and Evidence, Clinton Devon Estates said:\nWe are very proud to have the Otter Estuary recognised as a National Nature Reserve. The recently completed restoration project took over a decade to plan, fund and deliver.\nTo have the site’s conservation value recognised in this way makes it all worthwhile. The restoration work could not have been undertaken without the support of the Environment Agency who were our project partners in this endeavour.\nWe have been delighted with how nature is thriving in this greatly enhanced and expanded wetland with almost every week bringing a new species sighting. It has also been wonderful to see the overwhelmingly positive response from the public who can easily access the site and connect with nature.\nOver the coming years we will continue to record how the habitats evolve and how wildlife benefits with important research work supported by a strong team of local citizen scientists.\nAs well as managing this wonderful reserve, the efforts of our team are now focused on building on the nature gains we have seen with our long-term goal being to go further and create a ‘super’ National Nature Reserve that powers nature recovery across the agricultural hinterlands that link all of the component parts of the Pebblebed Heaths NNR.\nNational Nature Reserve status is given to the very best nature conservation sites in England and is recognition that the land is nationally important and will be managed in perpetuity for its wildlife and geology. Many National Nature Reserves are managed by multiple parties also known as Approved Bodies who are committed to working together towards a shared future vision for the Nature Reserve. Clinton Devon Estates is the Approved Body for the entire Pebblebed Heaths NNR, with Devon Wildlife Trust and the RSPB also Approved Bodies for the previously declared area.\nRead more about the power of National Nature Reserves in this blog by Tony Juniper.\nFurther information Approved Bodies National Nature Reserves are an excellent way for partners to work together and effect environmental improvements. But only Approved Bodies can join the management of these reserves.\nTo become an Approved Body, the applicant must demonstrate a record of conservation management to prove they can manage a national nature reserve in the long term before their application is approved by Natural England. Individuals cannot become an Approved Body.\nNational Nature Reserves National Nature Reserves (NNRs) are open to the public, and we welcome all our visitors to connect with nature and be inspired by our fantastic wildlife, habitats, geology and landscapes.\nWhen visiting our reserves please follow the countryside code to enable everyone to enjoy, value and respect England’s most important places for nature.\nNNRs were established to protect some of our most important habitats, species and geology, and to provide ‘outdoor laboratories’ for research. Most NNRs offer great opportunities to schools, specialist interest groups and the public to experience wildlife at first hand and to learn more about nature conservation.\nThere are currently 219 NNRs in England with a total area of over 109,000 hectares - approximately 0.8% of the country’s land surface. The largest is The Wash covering almost 8,800 hectares, while Dorset’s Horn Park Quarry is the smallest at 0.32 hectares.\nSee: - details of the reserves and their special features in the county lists - the location of England’s NNRs on the MAGIC website\nNatural England manages about two thirds of England’s NNRs. The remaining reserves are managed by organisations approved by Natural England, for example, the National Trust, Forestry England, RSPB, Wildlife Trusts and local authorities Mendip will be the third largest NNR in Somerset.\nIt is estimated that the 135 NNRs managed by Natural England remove up to 185,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year, providing an annual benefit of an estimated £12 million. They are also an important recreational resource, attracting an estimated 20 million visits a year. Natural England managed NNRs do not charge for access so visits represent free recreational experiences estimated to be worth £22 million per year, with associated benefits from visitors to local businesses. (Figures from Natural England 2019, Accounting for Nature Reserves\nThe King’s Series of National Natures Reserves: Natural England will leave a lasting public legacy for people and nature by creating the King’s Series of National Nature Reserves to celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III.\nAs Prince of Wales, His Majesty expressed a deep love and concern for England’s wildlife, natural and rural places, frequently reflecting on his love of walking and its role in promoting a healthy mind and body.\nAs the government’s focus moves on from an era of nature conservation to nature recovery to create spaces for wildlife to thrive, this new series showcases our ambition for bigger, better and more connected spaces for nature – building on those declared in the reign of her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.",

    "text": "“I fedeli sono pregati di non dare l’elemosina ai mendicanti in chiesa e nemmeno nei dintorni”, parole dure soprattutto se scritte in un cartello affisso in una chiesa. E sotto Natale. La chiesa in questione è quella dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua di via Santa Lucia, in centro a Padova.\n“Sono scandalizzato, e mi dispiace che sotto Natale non ci sia posto per i poveri in chiesa”, ha commentato al Mattino di Padova don Albino Bizzotto , presidente dell’associazione Beati costruttori di pace.\nLa richiesta va contro i principi cristiani della solidarietà e dell’aiuto ai poveri. Ed è saltato all’occhio dei fedeli, provocandone l’indignazione. Ma l’Opera dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua sostiene con forza l’iniziativa: bandita non è l’elemosina, ha precisato, quanto la pratica dell’accattonaggio molesto. “La chiesa resta sempre aperta, 24 ore su 24. È per questo che noi abbiamo anche il compito di garantire il rispetto e il silenzio in tutti quei momenti di intimo raccoglimento dei fedeli», spiega una referente dell’opera religiosa al Mattino.\n\"Essendo una chiesa sempre aperta e non una parrocchia, gli accattoni gravitano intorno al luogo di culto a tutte le ore e non solo durante le occasionali funzioni religiose, anche di notte. Questo ha portato problemi anche ai commercianti della zona che si sono lamentati per la presenza costante di gente che chiede l’elemosina”, ha concluso la referente. “Alcuni fedeli sono stati avvicinati in orari notturni da alcuni mendicanti molesti che in modo insistente hanno chiesto denaro, non solo disturbando i momenti di culto, ma diffondendo anche un certo senso di insicurezza”.\nMa per don Albino Bizzotto non ci sono scuse. “I poveri meritano attenzione soprattutto in questi giorni. Certo, va individuato l’opportunismo, ma non agire in modo generalizzato precludendo ai bisognosi la carità”\nArgomenti chiesa padova Leggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",

    "text": "On Thursday night, Dec. 28, workers at Advanced Grow Labs in the New Haven County city of West Haven voted unanimously to ratify their union contract, according to a United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 919 spokesperson. The contract is the first such cannabis union agreement in the history of Connecticut and includes guaranteed wage increases of up to 25 percent over three years, increased holiday pay, secured retirement and health insurance, increased safety measures, and on-the-job protection. The ratification comes months after workers at AGL formed the union in March 2023, becoming the first cannabis workers in Connecticut to do so. “I am proud to be a part of the first cannabis union in Connecticut,” said AGL Production Technician Alanna Daniels, who continued, \"This has been a huge milestone for the industry in the state and our company. I hope other workers can come together like we have.” AGL Harvest Technician Christopher Mckenzie called the agreement \"groundbreaking.\" “We have a voice at work now and a better future coming now that we have a union contract,\" Mckenzie added. The UFCW, which represents tens of thousands of cannabis workers across the US in dispensaries, labs, delivery, kitchens, manufacturing, processing, grow facilities, and more, is the country's largest cannabis workers union.
