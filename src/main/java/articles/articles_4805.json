    "title": "Tras su ESTADO CRÍTICO de SALUD, el PAPA FRANCISCO no pronunciará el ÁNGELUS este domingo",
    "text": "La medida se repite tras el domingo anterior. El Papa Francisco no participó en la habitual oración. Esta decisión ha generado gran expectación en la comunidad católica.\nEl pontífice se encuentra en el hospital y atraviesa un momento delicado. Los médicos han confirmado que sufre de neumonía bilateral, lo que requiere atención y monitoreo constante.\nEl Papa ha enviado un mensaje que será publicado por el Vaticano. En el texto, expresa palabras de aliento y reflexión, y dicha publicación reemplaza la tradicional oración en voz alta.\nLa decisión provoca una mezcla de inquietud y esperanza entre los fieles. La noticia despierta diversas emociones en aquellos que siguen las palabras del Papa, mientras los creyentes mantienen la fe en medio de este tiempo de prueba. El portavoz del Vaticano, Matteo Bruni, ha confirmado que el Vaticano publicará el mensaje, el cual fue revelado durante una conferencia de prensa. Bruni subraya el compromiso del Papa con la fe y la comunidad.\nEl Papa Francisco “no está fuera de peligro”\nEn una rueda de prensa, el doctor Sergio Alfieri, responsable de Cirugía en el Gemelli, brindó detalles sobre el estado del pontífice, quien sufre de una infección polimicrobiológica acompañada de una neumonía bilateral. A pesar de los desafíos que enfrenta, los médicos aseguraron que su vida no corre peligro en este momento.\nEl pontífice, de 88 años, ha mostrado signos de mejora desde su ingreso, pero los médicos recalcaron que esto no significa que esté completamente fuera de peligro. Francisco es un “paciente frágil”, ya que padece de bronquiectasia y bronquitis asmática crónica, lo que agrava su situación respiratoria. Sin embargo, no presenta otras patologías graves, y su corazón se mantiene fuerte, lo que es positivo según el equipo médico.\nA pesar de su delicado estado, los médicos han destacado que el Papa sigue demostrando un fuerte espíritu de lucha. Luigi Carbone, médico de la Dirección de la Sanidad del Vaticano, mencionó que Francisco incluso ha rezado en la capilla del hospital y continúa mostrando buen humor. “No es una persona que se rinda”, afirmó Carbone.\nA lo largo de su tratamiento, el Papa ha sido alimentado con apetito y no requiere respiración asistida, aunque se le administra oxígeno cuando es necesario. A pesar de su mejoría, deberá permanecer en el hospital al menos hasta la próxima semana, hasta que la neumonía se haya curado por completo. Los médicos subrayaron que, tras su alta, Francisco continuará su tratamiento en su residencia en Santa Marta.",

    "text": "Wage Negotiations Reach Impasse at Czech Hyundai Plant Negotiations over wages and working conditions at the Hyundai factory in Nošovice , Czech Republic, have stifled, potentially leading to a dispute and potential strike last month.\nThe unions, who represent employees, have publicly declared that the company’s proposals are detrimental to workers, arguing that the proposed adjustments will significantly diminish both their nominal and actual wages.\nPatrik Fupš, leader of the trade union at Hyundai in Nošovice exonerates the company of playing fair. \"Everything they propose is in the red,\" he said, emphasizing the\nautomotive giant’s proposals would worsen working conditions for employees.\nAccording to the union, Hyundai, for example, has declined to provide an extraordinary bonus tied to a record profit of almost 14 billion crowns, attributing this decision to the need to pay for development and fines levied due to not meeting emission targets.\nFurther fueling discontent, Hyundai proposes to raise canteen prices, eliminate severance payments in cases of long-term health issues which prevent an employee from working, and lay off 100 employees while simultaneously hiring roughly the same number of workers in October\nThe workers’ representatives expressed their unwillingness to entertain any further discussions until Hyundai puts forward a contrasting offer, ensuring no worsening of employee conditions. They addressed their proposal was delivered to Hyundai management, who allegedly refused to discuss the union’s proposal any further\n\"They tried, it didn’t work to reach an agreement,\" said Fupš, stating negotiations reached an impasse after the second canvassing. \"The differences between their proposal and ours are profound.\nNow we’ve requested the employer make a genuine counter-proposal,” he added, highlighting the existing collective agreement remains valid until late March.\n\"We are in no danger of that agreement expiring vol junit review\nA Hyundai Motif Czech spokesperson said they policy obligates non-disclosure in this situation. Publicly stating their commitment to accompanying growth, he underlined that\na response cannot be offered at present, this\n\"In general, I can say that in every collective bargaining, even outside of them, our goal is to improve the working conditions of employees while maintaining the long-term prosperity of the company,\"\nAmong other things, however, an increase in wages\nHyundai employs roughly 3,100 individuals at the Nošovice factory, with additional. Roughly 8,700 individuals employed throughHyundai’s supply chain.\nAccording to them, their gonna\ndo is why they are asking for continuous pay the complexities\nWhat are the main points of contention in the wage talks between Hyundai and the workers’ union? ## Hyundai Workers Face Uncertain Future as Wage ⁣Talks Stall\n**Interviewer:** ‌Welcome to ​the show. Today, we’re discussing the ongoing wage negotiations at Hyundai’s factory in Nošovice, Czech Republic. Joining us is Patrik Fupš, leader of the trade union at the plant. Thank you for joining us, Patrik.\n**Patrik Fupš:** Thank you‍ for having me.\n**Interviewer:** ​Let’s delve right into it. The​ negotiations seem to have hit a wall. Can you tell⁢ us⁤ what the key sticking points are?\n**Patrik Fupš:** [conditial content based on provided context: If it states that negotiations are ongoing, use this:]\nThe situation⁢ is quite concerning. While we’re still at the negotiating table, Hyundai’s proposals are simply unacceptable. They would significantly cut into our ‌members’ incomes, both in terms of nominal‍ and real ⁣wages.\n[If it states negotiations have ended without agreement, use this:]\nUnfortunately, the negotiations have reached an impasse. Hyundai’s final offer was a slap ⁣in the face to the hard-working employees who contribute to their record profits.\n**Interviewer:** You mentioned a decrease in real wages. Can you elaborate on that?\n**Patrik Fupš:** Absolutely. Hyundai is‌ proposing hikes that don’t keep pace with inflation, effectively lowering our purchasing power. On top of that, they’re refusing ‌to share the prosperity with workers despite raking in close⁣ to 14 ‍billion crowns in profit. They claim this ​is needed for⁢ development​ and to cover fines for not meeting emission⁢ targets, but it seems like they’re prioritizing profits over the wellbeing of their​ employees.\n**Interviewer:** Are there any⁢ specific ​examples you can share that highlight the difficulties workers are facing?\n**Patrik Fupš:** Definitely. They’re‌ even proposing to increase canteen prices, which directly impacts the affordability of ‍meals for our members. It just adds insult to ‌injury.\n**Interviewer:** This situation certainly paints a​ worrying picture. What are the next steps‌ for ​the ⁣union?\n**Patrik Fupš:** We’re deeply disappointed with Hyundai’s stance and are currently consulting with our members about the next course​ of action. We‌ won’t rule anything out, including the possibility of a strike, if Hyundai continues to disregard the legitimate concerns‌ of their workforce.\n**Interviewer:**⁢ Patrik Fupš, thank⁤ you for your time and insights into‌ this critical situation. We’ll continue to follow this story closely.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "Blue Ivy Carter turns 12 years old today! Once named “the most famous baby in the world” by [TIME](https://newsfeed.time.com/2012/01/09/jay-z-releases-glory-featuring-his-daughter-blue-ivys-cries/) magazine, Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s first child has grown up before our eyes. From her quiet presence to her, at times, stand-out style and personality, Blue Ivy is coming into her very own while managing the lights, cameras, and attention of being part of the Knowles-Carter dynasty. She is big sister to twins Rumi Carter, 6, and Sir Carter, 6, and granddaughter to glam-ma Tina Knowles. Proud of her family, Tina has been candid about her love for her grandchild. Last year, Tina penned a heartfelt message to Blue Ivy celebrating her 11th birthday. “You are funny and beautiful and graceful, Kind, and so smart. I could not ask for a better granddaughter Ms. Blue Ivy Carter! I could not be more blessed, grateful, and completely in love with another human. You truly bring me joy!!” Tina said, among other sweet comments, in the love-filled post. See the full message below. Blue Ivy Carter is carving out her own public lane. Despite her young age, Blue Ivy has had several memorable moments, making us all feel like big sisters, brothers, cousins, and mentors. More publicly seen than her younger siblings, she has accompanied her famous parents to high-profile events like the MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammy Awards, NBA basketball games, and galas and events such as the opening of Jay Z’s [“The Book of HOV”](https://hellobeautiful.com/3882697/beyonce-blue-ivy-book-of-hov/) in Brooklyn.

La ‘doccia fredda’ è arrivata nei giorni scorsi ai 40 impiegati dell’ufficio che si trova nell’area industriale dell’Osmannoro, in via Volturno: \"La prima comunicazione da parte dell’azienda – spiega Stefano Becocci Filt Cgil contattato sulla vicenda – è dello scorso 4 settembre e indica la volontà di chiudere la sede dell’Osmannoro e di trasferire i lavoratori in un’altra sede dell’azienda che si trova a Livorno Collesalvetti. A Sesto tutti i lavoratori sono nel ruolo di impiegati\". Decisione che, chiaramente, ha suscitato una grossa preoccupazione fra i lavoratori e i sindacati anche perché, per persone residenti nell’area di Firenze, sarebbe molto difficile, se non impossibile, spostarsi quotidianamente per lavorare a Livorno. Uno scenario, fra l’altro, già visto sul territorio sestese dai dipendenti del Cartonificio fiorentino cui, ormai da molti anni, è stato prospettato il trasferimento nella sede di Altopascio con la chiusura dello stabilimento di Sesto.\nAl momento non è certo se lo spostamento sulla costa potrà comportare degli esuberi: \"Su questo punto – prosegue Becocci – c’è incertezza, non abbiamo risposte precise ma contiamo che ci vengano fornite il prossimo 24 settembre, giorno in cui incontreremo l’azienda. In quella sede chiederemo che ci vengano date informazioni precise su quello che si intende fare, sulle modalità, sui tempi e, chiaramente, sulla questione occupazionale. Fra l’altro, visto che l’azienda fa parte del gruppo Dhl, chiederemo se, in caso dovessero esserci esuberi, i lavoratori interessati possano essere ricollocati in altre attività di Dhl\".\nÈ comunque forte la preoccupazione di Filt Cgil Area metropolitana \"per la possibile perdita di posti di lavoro e soprattutto per l’impoverimento della Piana perché, ovviamente – prosegue Becocci - se il lavoro va da un’altra parte c’è una perdita per quest’area e faremo di tutto per evitarlo\". Intanto, oggi i sindacati incontreranno, nella sede di via Volturno, i dipendenti della Hillebrand Gori per illustrare la situazione e per cercare una linea condivisa: \"L’incontro – conclude l’esponente della Filt – sarà un passaggio anche formale per la nomina della Rsa\".",

    "text": "LAKE COUNTY, Colo. (KKTV) - Even with a heat wave, snow is still an issue in some part of Colorado! Lake County Search and Rescue says it has to rescue an injured hiker over the weekend after he slipped while navigating a snow field on Mt. Massive. “The subject had slipped crossing a snow field and slid 600 vertical feet,” LCSAR said in a social media post Sunday night. Search and Rescue crews responded to the southwest slope of the mountain Saturday morning. “Our team hiked in 4 miles making contact with the subject on [the] trail at 12,300 feet,” LCSAR said. “... The call came in from a satellite communication device, so limited information was available besides location. Classic Air Medical was on standby doing a flyover to look for landing zones in case the subject was in critical condition.” The hiker was injured but ultimately able to walk himself out. “This is a great reminder of how high angle snow fields are very common on the peaks during early summer conditions. Ensure to bring traction devices such as microspikes, and an ice axe in order to self-arrest in case of a slide,” Search and Rescue said. Copyright 2024 KKTV. All rights reserved.",
