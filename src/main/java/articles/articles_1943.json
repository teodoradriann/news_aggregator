    "title": "Engineering needs to attract more women to fill its 6,000 vacancies",
    "text": "Failure to address the gender imbalance in engineering will exacerbate the existing skills shortage, warns Engineers Ireland (EI), the industry’s national representative body. The engineering sector employs 60,000 people in Ireland. Recent research for EI estimated that 6,000 vacancies in engineering would arise in 2024. Just 24% of student engineers in Ireland are female. Pay gaps after graduation are not helping — with 20.1% of male graduates of engineering, manufacturing and construction earning a salary of €60,000 or more, compared to 12.7% of females. “Boosting female participation is a priority for engineering companies worldwide,” said Damien Owens, director general, Engineers Ireland. “A lot of companies in Ireland are recruiting engineers from overseas, so around half of our newest members are from overseas. “The gender balance is 60:40 among our new members, which is much more equitable versus the 24% of female engineering students in Ireland. A lot of these new members are in biomed, mechanical, software and robotics. “We need to raise awareness of how engineering has diversified as a profession in line with the technological advances and demands in other sectors. It is not just about building roads and bridges, though these activities remain vital to society.” Changing perceptions around engineering will be a key theme for EI at this year’s National Ploughing Championships in Ratheniska, Co Laois, where its stand will feature an autonomous robot dog, Setanta, who works at construction sites conducting laser scans to identify deviations from construction plans, testing air quality and other roles deemed unsafe for humans. The EI stand will also feature a life-sized representation of the human heart and arterial system, engineered to support biomedical research to combat heart disease; an interactive Formula 1 experience demonstrating the importance of automotive engineering to motorsports; and an opportunity for attendees to visit space through virtual reality. EI’s research shows that one in four people consider engineering to be a better career for men than women. The battle for minds, however, starts far earlier than one might think. “Research shows that by age 7-to-10, a lot of our career choices are already made,” says Damien Owens. “We need to get to people early, even before secondary school, when people are streaming their subjects towards their career choices. “We need to change fears around the difficulty of maths and people’s perceptions that engineering is only for the mentally elite. There are a lot of things we need to change. Unfortunately, there’s no silver bullet solution.” One positive impetus for female engineers is a seeming absence of a glass ceiling in engineering. An EI survey a few years ago showed that women occupy more senior roles in engineering than in many other professions, in many cases paid more than their male counterparts. Still, EI believes that this finding does little to offset their concerns around female graduates earning less than their male colleagues. And of the 24% of female students graduating in engineering, just half (12%) go on to pursue a career in engineering. That fall-off rate, however, may be partly masked by the fact that engineering graduates end up working in sectors as diverse as medical devices and robotics to wind farms. Data from the HEA shows that male graduates of STEM courses are twice as likely as their female counterparts to have the word “engineer” in their job title, nine months after graduation. Either way, none of this deflects EI’s focus from seeking to boost the levels of female participation in engineering and its plans to promote greater gender balance in STEM roles with campaigns in schools, the Ploughing Championships and elsewhere. Damien Owens says: “We need to change perceptions of engineering in Ireland to encourage more women and other underrepresented groups, such as students from more rural backgrounds, to consider it as a career path. Engineering is vital for the functioning of the Irish economy and there is a real risk of skills shortages in the future as the demand for engineering continues to grow. “Greater representation of our society in engineering will not only shore up skills shortages, but it will also bring new ways of thinking and better balance to the future of the profession, which is increasingly focused on innovation and data-centric problem-solving. “It is particularly concerning that younger people of 16 to 24 consider engineering as a ‘man’s job’. We want to challenge that perception and show younger people in particular that engineering is open to everyone,” he adds. Engineers Ireland’s exhibition at the National Ploughing Championships will be open to the public to visit from September 17-19. EI also has resources on its website for teachers, career guidance counsellors, parents and students as part of its STEPS Programme: www.engineersireland.ie/schools",

    "title": "Ten years later, improper behavior on field trip leads to another departure at CHS",
    "text": "CUMBERLAND – Ten years ago this week, a pair of teachers leading a group of Cumberland High School students on a trip to Ecuador provided those students with alcohol, an action that helped lead to their resignation.\nParents at the time said they wanted to make sure nothing similar to this ever happened again, saying their children were also left alone in a city for long periods of time, and that they were told not to talk to their parents after they got home about what had transpired.\nMemories of that trip were front of mind last week after Michael Feroce, the Cumberland High School band director credited with bringing back the program after a long hiatus, resigned following an inappropriate incident on a field trip.\nFeroce, according to school officials, was found to have been inside the hotel room of female high school students for an extended period of time during an overnight field trip.\nThe departed teacher has not responded to requests for comment.\nThere was no evidence that inappropriate contact was involved, according to school officials, but Feroce was in the room late in the evening during a trip to New York City over Memorial Day weekend.\n“Although Mr. Feroce’s presence in the room appeared consensual and there was no evidence uncovered of improper physical contact on this trip, Mr. Feroce’s decision to go into the hotel room of female students late in the evening reflected conduct that the superintendent found unacceptable,” School Committee Chairperson Amy Vogel said in a statement at a meeting to discuss the matter on Wednesday evening, June 18.\nAdded Vogel, “the superintendent believed that Mr. Feroce’s conduct was unbecoming of a Cumberland School Department teacher and irreconcilable with further employment,” Vogel added.\nStudents were interviewed as part of the investigation, according to school officials. Vogel said those conversations revealed that Feroce had students help him with household tasks at his home, “which in of itself reflects a boundary violation.”\nFeroce has been known for his energetic advocacy for the band, bringing it from a struggling program to one of the top ones in the area, routinely performing well at competitions.\nParents have been critical of school officials for not communicating openly about what was transpiring, and that they had to rely on rumors told to them by their children.\nAsked this week whether the overnight field trip policies need to change in response to this latest incident, Supt. Phil Thornton said the policy is pretty comprehensive, and no policy could have prevented what happened. That said, after any incident, it’s prudent to “review everything we do based on current events,” he said.\nCHS Principal Adolfo Costa agreed on the idea that these trips still have value.\n“I believe overnight field trips can be incredibly rewarding and enriching opportunities for students,” he said. “It’s important not to lose sight of the educational and social growth these experiences can provide.”\nFeroce began teaching at CHS during the 2013-2014 school year following the departure of longtime band director Lisa Koziol-Kenyon. He graduated with a degree in music education from the University of Rhode Island in 2012. At the time, there were only about 40 students participating in band, and Feroce and students began selling Clipper Coffee that year as a start to bringing back the marching band and color guard after a decade without one.\n“It’s really endless what you can do with a marching band,” Feroce said at the time, adding that the band can attend all sporting events. “It would bring a lot of attention to Cumberland for sure.”\nThe band grew into an award-winning program under Feroce’s leadership, as he repeatedly lobbied for resources, including new uniforms. He also helped bring back the program after it was halted during the pandemic, and also grew music classes during his tenure.\n“Pre-pandemic, we were setting enrollment records, scoring top-level superior performances at band and choral festivals, and performing dozens of gigs a year,” he said in 2022.\nHe said then that he was happy to see Cumberland’s Clipper Band and Chorus returning to their pre-pandemic selves, with Director Amanda Santo running the chorus and Clef Singers as part of a vibrant music department.",
