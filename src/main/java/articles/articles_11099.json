    "title": "The Great Lakes go digital as smart buoy network launches in Lake Erie | City Pulse",
    "text": "Lake Erie is the first of the Great Lakes getting connected to the internet with a series of offshore “smart” buoys. And it’s not just for sending texts on the water. The buoy project, called the [Smart Lake Erie Watershed Initiative](https://www.clevelandwateralliance.org/smart-lake-erie-watershed-initiative), is providing invaluable data to researchers and anglers. The initiative was created by the Cleveland Water Alliance, a group that protects and improves how the Great Lakes are used in Ohio. The alliance works with a local engineering group, Freeboard Technology, to develop and deploy the buoys. Smart Lake Erie makes water conditions, contaminants and nutrients easily accessible, said Ed Verhamme, Freeboard Technology’s president. Eventually it will be available across all of the Great Lakes. Related: Smart Lake Erie is an infrastructure investment that will better prepare the region for harmful algal blooms, oil spills and the consequences of climate change, experts say. “We really take for granted how easy it is on land to provide (cellular) coverage,” Verhamme said. “With the network, it’s going to be easier and cheaper to monitor the Great Lakes.” Other methods of connecting to the internet on the water — cell modems and satellite telemetry — are expensive and inconvenient, Verhamme said. But Smart Lake Erie allows users to directly connect their devices through short-wave radio. The goal is to have over 200 sensors in buoys and cell towers in the network to provide over 12,000 square miles of coverage, Verhamme said. Right now, about half of the area is covered, with service available over 20 miles off the Ohio coast. That includes parts of Lake Erie and nearby wetlands that drain into it. The complete project, Smart Great Lakes, will provide coverage to populated areas of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Superior with over 300 buoys, Verhamme said. Each buoy can monitor local weather and water conditions such as temperature, depth and contaminant concentrations. The data is [publicly available](https://freeboard.tech/data-portals/#smartlakeerie) and can be accessed by texting the buoy. Public safety is one of Smart Lake Erie’s many uses, Verhamme said. Sensors can detect changes in water depth, wind speed and changes in humidity to alert boaters of an approaching storm. “Lake Erie is a phenomenal resource,” Verhamme said. “We know it’s got billions of dollars of economic value to the region and we think there’s some technology that can lower the risk for people to be out on the lake and also be safer while they do it.” The buoy networks are also revolutionizing climate monitoring in the Great Lakes, said Steve Ruberg, a researcher for the Observing Systems and Advanced Technology branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Right now, most information collected on the water is retrieved from buoys about once a year. With the buoy network, the same information is available in an instant. “You can’t really make good decisions unless you have good data,” Ruberg said. One of Ruberg’s longest projects — a 30-year study of Great Lakes temperatures — shows that the region’s winter season is shorteniong. This change has disturbed the lake’s nutrient cycling, which is vital for organisms to survive. Poor nutrient cycling can harmt fish populations, Ruberg said. Collecting real-time data on water conditions using Smart Great Lakes could allow decision-makers and fisheries to respond to the effects of climate change faster. “There are folks making decisions about stocking additional fish and folks making decisions about trying to restore native fishes, such as whitefish,” he said. “It could inform decisions like that.” In addition to NOAA, researchers at Michigan Technological University and Lake Superior State University have been collaborating with Freeboard Technology on water studies leveraging the expansive network, Verhamme said. One proposed study would deploy small “drifters” that float through the water to map the path of algal blooms. The buoy network would relay their location and the local algae concentration in real-time. Similar drifters cost over $10,000 to equip with the power and radios needed to communicate with satellites, Verhamme said. But his team has gotten the price down to about $500. “People will see it’s going to be easier and cheaper to monitor the Great Lakes, understand the movement of harmful algal blooms,” he said. “Most scientists would agree it’s going to help us understand these as well as know how to manage them in the future.” Christopher Pace, chief of the Great Lakes Center for Oil Spill Expertise, said Smart Lake Erie helps the U.S. Coast Guard prepare for oil spills. “Their Lake Erie network, it’s really, I would say groundbreaking with the amount of data available and the grid system that they’ve set up there,” Pace said. The Great Lakes Commission [reported](https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/Oil-Transp-Risk-Assessment-Marty-June2017-FinalReport.pdf) in 2017 that the coasts of Toledo and Buffalo have the highest risk of an oil spill that would be “devastating” to protected fish and wildlife populations and their habitats. “The Great Lakes present a unique challenge for oil spills,” Pace said. Spills are harder to detect in the winter because of ice cover, and not enough data is available to know if oil cleanup methods, like controlled burning, are safe for freshwater. But with Smart Lake Erie, buoys near these areas could detect hydrocarbons in the water, allowing spills and their range of impact to be detected early. With the help of Limno Tech, another engineering company Verhamme helps lead, Lake Superior State University is helping the U.S. Coast Guard test hydrocarbon sensors. “While hydrocarbons aren’t their specific focus, it helps us start to understand what monitoring in the Great Lakes or early detection of oil spills might look like,” Pace said. “While hydrocarbons aren’t their specific focus, it helps us start to understand what monitoring in the Great Lakes or early detection of oil spills might look like,” he said. And the buoy network is key to making the sensors possible. “A lot of these sensors exist in the federal arsenal, but at a cost many times more than what the teams here in the Great Lakes region are employing,” Pace said. “That’s because they’re taking some innovative approaches to off-the-shelf equipment and modifying it to meet the needs of the Great Lakes region. “And that’s really empowering.” The idea is to use technology to help scientists better understand biology and ecology, Verhamme said. “We’re showing them how we can use this tech and helping them unlock their creativity for problem solving.” The Great Lakes Echo originally published this [story](https://greatlakesecho.org/2024/01/30/smart-buoys-help-brace-great-lakes-for-environmental-challenges/) No comments on this item [Please log in to comment by clicking here](/login.html?referer=%2Fstories%2Fthe-great-lakes-go-digital-as-smart-buoy-network-launches-in-lake-erie%2C86661) [ Support City Pulse - Donate Today! ](https://lansingcitypulse.org/support-us/)",

    "text": "[Coolcaesar](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Department_of_Justice_headquarters,_August_12,_2006.jpg))\n[US DOJ seeks court order forcing Google to sell Chrome](#)\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) and a coalition of US states [filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.0.pdf) a motion on Wednesday seeking to compel Google to divest its Chrome web browser.\nThe DOJ argued that Google’s control over Chrome has significantly bolstered its monopolistic position in the search market. The department contended that forcing Google to divest Chrome is essential to remedy its illegal monopoly. In the case of Android, the department also [highlighted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.1_1.pdf) Google’s ability to leverage the operating system to favor its search products in both overt and subtle ways. However, rather than recommending a divestiture, the DOJ proposed a series of behavioral remedies aimed at limiting Google’s ability to use Android to further its dominance in general search and search text advertising. The DOJ warned that if these remedies prove insufficient, the court may ultimately be required to mandate the sale of Android as well.\nIn October, the DOJ [filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1052.0.pdf) prospective remedies that raised the potential for more aggressive actions, including the forced sale of Google’s Android operating system. The remedies being proposed by the government are extensive, ranging from limitations on new deals with phone or computer manufacturers to restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence, and even the possibility of a full-scale restructuring.\nThese measures are designed to last for 10 years, with specific exceptions outlined in the DOJ’s filing on Wednesday. The DOJ said its ultimate goal is to dismantle Google’s monopolistic control and restore competition to the general search ecosystem. Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker [described](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/) the government’s proposal as “extreme.”\nIn August, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia [found](https://www.jurist.org/news/2024/08/us-federal-judge-rules-google-violated-antitrust-law-by-monopolizing-internet-searches/) that Google illegally monopolized the online search and advertising markets. The DOJ said the court’s opinion underscores the decade-long harm caused by Google’s dominance in the markets for general search and search text advertising.\nGoogle is [scheduled](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/google-search-chrome-doj.html) to submit its own proposals for addressing the search monopoly by December 20. Both parties will have the chance to revise their requests before Judge Mehta hears arguments on the remedies in the spring, with a ruling anticipated by the end of the summer.\nThe Justice Department also [sued](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html) Apple in March, claiming the company has made it difficult for consumers to leave its ecosystem of devices and software. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission [filed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/ftc-amazon.html) separate lawsuits against Amazon and Meta, accusing them of anticompetitive practices and stifling competition.",

    "text": "Les anneaux imprimés en 3D fluorescents, une promesse pour les implants de demain\nCarla C.\nLe terme qui désigne les découvertes faites par hasard est la « sérendipité ». Parmi les avancées scientifiques les plus remarquables, on trouve la radioactivité, les rayons X, ainsi que la découverte de la pénicilline. Récemment, cette même sérendipité a conduit à une nouvelle avancée dans le domaine de la fabrication additive. Deux chercheurs de l’Université de l’Oregon, en discutant de manière informelle, ont eu l’idée de fusionner leurs compétences pour créer des anneaux 3D fluorescents destinés à des applications médicales. Ces anneaux pourraient ouvrir la voie au développement d’un nouveau type d’implant lumineux, facilitant le suivi et la surveillance une fois inséré dans le corps.\nLes chercheurs impliqués dans cette étude sont Paul Dalton, du Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact, et Ramesh Jasti, du département de chimie et de biochimie de l’Université de l’Oregon. Le laboratoire de Paul Dalton s’intéresse depuis un certain temps à une technique d’impression nommée « Melt Electrowriting », qui permet de créer des pièces 3D pour des applications médicales. De son côté, le laboratoire de Ramesh Jasti est reconnu pour ses travaux sur les « nanohoops », des cylindres en carbone qui émettent de la lumière lorsqu’ils sont exposés à la lumière ultraviolette. Ensemble, les chercheurs ont réussi à incorporer la quantité idéale de nanohoops fluorescents dans le matériau d’impression 3D, produisant ainsi des structures lumineuses durables et biocompatibles.\nCe qu’il faut savoir sur les anneaux 3D fluorescents\nSelon les chercheurs, des structures similaires avec des propriétés luminescentes ont déjà été envisagées, mais n’ont jamais pu être réalisées. En plus de nécessiter une technique d’impression 3D spécifique, la plupart des molécules fluorescentes se décomposent après une exposition prolongée à la chaleur. C’est ici que les travaux de Jasti se démarquent, car ses « nanohoops » sont stables, même à des températures élevées. Après avoir mené des tests pour vérifier que les nanohoops conservent leurs propriétés lorsqu’ils sont intégrés au matériau d’impression 3D, les chercheurs ont constaté qu’ils ne perdaient ni leur résistance ni leur stabilité. De plus, ils ont confirmé que l’ajout de molécules fluorescentes n’affectait pas la toxicité du matériau pour les cellules, ce qui est crucial pour son utilisation en biomédecine.\nLa conception des anneaux 3D fluorescents pourrait permettre de développer des implants. Selon les chercheurs, ces anneaux pourraient ouvrir la voie à diverses applications, notamment une nouvelle technologie de cicatrisation, des vaisseaux sanguins artificiels ou des échafaudages pour favoriser la régénération des nerfs.\nL’équipe envisage une variété d’applications, mettant en avant leur potentiel dans le domaine biomédical, notamment pour la création d’implants qui brillent sous la lumière UV. De plus, le matériau pourrait être adapté à des usages en matière de sécurité. Cependant, il faudra patienter avant de voir des applications concrètes, car l’équipe a récemment déposé une demande de brevet pour pouvoir commercialiser ses travaux.\nQue pensez-vous des anneaux 3D fluorescents ?

He is averaging 28.8 points since his debut on Dec. 19, when he capped a 34-point performance by hitting the game-winning shot at New Orleans. Denver is without Aaron Gordon, who suffered lacerations on his face and hands resulting from dog bites suffered on Christmas. --Field Level Media Your comment has been submitted.
