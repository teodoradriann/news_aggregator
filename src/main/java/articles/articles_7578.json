    "text": "ST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. – West County EMS and Fire said recent training was put into action Wednesday when responding to a call for a rescue in Winchester. “So, confined space, boat rescues, water rescues—a lot of those get what you call rescue major responses. So, you’re getting all the right parts and pieces,” Deputy Chief Kelly Grassmuck, West County EMS & Fire, said. Many people watched the coverage, but Grassmuck said what the public didn’t see was the training leading up to the rescue. “We just so happened to select trench training for the second quarter of this year,” he said. Grassmuck said the rescuers have completed two out of three trainings, meaning there is still time to add in elements from Wednesday’s rescue. “When we do sets here, you’re dealing with prefabricated sides and all this other stuff. So, the sets here, when we set panels and we shoot struts and all that, it’s pretty clean. Yesterday, we had to modify a lot of that on the fly,” Grassmuck said. One of those modifications could be the number of panels holding up walls of dirt. In training, Grassmuck said they typically use four or six; Wednesday they used two. “There are things that we never really thought of, like how small these holes can be and just foundation work where you’re digging a hole out,” he said. Grassmuck said another learning point was the equipment brought out for each rescue major. “We had the vac truck tube running over the carport and then we had the flexible tube running to that and that is the first time I’ve ever used one on a call and it was invaluable,” he said. Grassmuck said they’re thankful for Wednesday’s successful rescue. “Climbed out and walked over to the stretcher. Given the high fatality rate in trench collapses, very lucky,” he said. “The large percentage of these, upwards of 85%, are not survivable. So, yesterday was a very good day all around for us and for him.”",

    "text": "Sunday, December 24, 2023 02:40 pm Mirna Walid – Beirut – Lebanese artist Reem Al-Sharif sparked controversy by declaring that the interpretation of the Holy Qur’an is distorted and that Islam did not forbid alcohol. She said: “A religion of 1,400 years has not been distorted? It has not been distorted?” She continued that the interpretation of the Qur’an is distorted, and considered that the Holy Qur’an does not forbid alcohol. Where God said a verse: “Do not approach prayer while you are drunk,” and He did not say, “Do not become drunk,” as it expresses it. Reem’s statement came during her interview on the “What’s the Story” program with journalist Rabaa Al-Zayat. Reem’s statements were met with objection by some, who considered her words to be completely untrue. These were the details of Reem Al-Sharif’s [news](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/news/) that sparked controversy with her statement that the interpretation of the Qur’an is distorted and Islam did not prohibit alcohol for today.

    "text": "Poonch (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], August 23 (ANI): A PoK resident and Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group guide identified as Zaher Hussein Shah has been apprehended by the Indian Army in Poonch, confirmed police. Earlier on Thursday, as part of efforts to thwart the Pakistan Army's designs to revive terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Army and other security agencies have redeployed troops and special forces in the higher reaches of areas south of Pir Panjal to carry out search and destroy operations.

The Indian Army and security forces have deployed more than 10 battalions and over 500 Special Forces operatives in the areas south of Pir Panjal range to tackle the terrorist activities prompted by the Pakistan Army, sources in security agencies told ANI. The Indian Army has now moved the troops to carry out searches in the forested areas with a proactive approach to take out terrorists who have been hiding in natural caves and man-made underground hideouts, sources said.

The sources said the idea is to search and locate terrorists at higher reaches and not let them come down and target civilians and security forces there, sources added. The human intelligence grid has also been strengthened in the area with the induction of new police officials in the area while the central police forces have also strengthened their presence and activities, the sources said. Indian Army and security agencies have suffered multiple casualties as the terrorists took advantage of the relatively low presence of troops in view of redeployments done for the standoff at the northern borders. The new inductions in the area including the armoured vehicles and mine-protected vehicles have also strengthened the forces. The security deployment and standard operating procedures in the entire Jammu division including Rajouri, Poonch, Udhampur and Doda districts have been revised and all troops in the area are on high alert to thwart any terror attack, the sources said. The local over-ground workers and terrorist sympathisers have also been identified and are being taken care of by the security agencies, they said. Support by some locals in these areas to help terrorists has also been found and measures are being taken to curb that with area domination and other measures, they said. The top Army brass have also discussed the terror situation in the area recently and have also briefed the top leadership on the action being taken by them.

    "title": "Strage di Natale in Nigeria: 190 morti in una serie di attacchi | il manifesto",
    "text": "Strage di Natale in Nigeria: 190 morti in una serie di attacchi «Attacco barbaro, brutale e ingiustificato». Così Caleb Mutfwang, governatore dello stato di Plateau in Nigeria ha descritto i sanguinosi attacchi che tra sabato 23 e martedì 26 dicembre hanno causato «almeno 198 vittime e 500 feriti nei villaggi di Bokkos e Barkin Ladi». I gruppi armati, definiti dal governo di Abuja «banditi», hanno colpito non meno di 20 villaggi, con «una serie di attacchi ben coordinati e pianificati», secondo le autorità locali. Fino a ieri non è giunta nessuna rivendicazione e restano sconosciute le cause, ma secondo il quotidiano The Punch, la principale causa potrebbe essere legata a «violenze jihadiste» o «scontri confessionali»: gli attacchi avevano l’obiettivo di «uccidere e non depredare risorse o sequestrare persone». Scontri confessionali legati principalmente alla sanguinosa lotta tra agricoltori cristiani e pastori musulmani che, in meno di 5 anni, ha causato «almeno 10mila vittime nelle regioni centrali del paese». Un conflitto sulla proprietà della terra e delle acque reso ancora più acuto a causa della siccità e dalla desertificazione della Nigeria settentrionale. Amnesty International ha richiesto al presidente Bola Ahmed Tinubu un’indagine «imparziale ed efficace», per capire cosa abbia motivato gli attacchi nella regione, già colpita più volte in passato. Dure le critiche nei confronti di Tinubu – nonostante la visita di mercoledì nel Plateau del vicepresidente Kashim Shettima – accusato di «inerzia e cattiva gestione della sicurezza», visto che alcuni residenti hanno accusato «un ritardo di 12 ore alla loro richiesta di soccorso da parte delle forze di sicurezza». Le opposizioni considerano «inefficace» la campagna militare lanciata lo scorso settembre dal presidente per porre fine alle violenze jihadiste di Boko Haram e dello Stato islamico dell’Africa occidentale (Iswap) nello stato del Borno (nord-est) in un conflitto che in questi 15 anni ha causato oltre «50mila vittime e 2 milioni di profughi» secondo l’Onu. Come altrettanto inutili sembrano i tentativi del governo centrale di limitare gli attacchi e i rapimenti in continua crescita nel nord-ovest e nel centro del paese a causa della crescente povertà e del proliferare delle formazioni di «banditi». Riguardo alle connivenze tra «banditi» e gruppi jihadisti, un recente report di Malik Samuel – ricercatore dell’Istituto studi sulla sicurezza (Iss) di Bamako – afferma che «Iswap arma e sostiene questi gruppi con l’obiettivo di radicalizzarli e destabilizzare maggiormente la Nigeria».",

    "title": "Los emblemas de Boca que están en duda para el partido ante Instituto - TyC Sports",
    "text": "Edinson Cavani y Marcos Rojo, al límite físicamente de cara a Boca vs. Instituto El Matador y el capitán del equipo de Diego Martínez hicieron ejercicios regenerativos con el resto de los que fueron titulares en la victoria contra Independiente del Valle en la Copa Sudamericana. Están en duda para la visita a Alta Córdoba. El plantel de Boca se entrenó este jueves por la tarde en el predio de Ezeiza luego de vencer a Independiente del Valle en La Bombonera y obtener la clasificación a los octavos de final de la Copa Sudamericana. Aunque la espuma del triunfo todavía dura en los paladeras del Xeneize, Diego Martínez comenzó a planificar el partido del domingo contra Instituto, en Alta Córdoba, con la duda de las presencias de Edinson Cavani y Marcos Rojo. La práctica vespertina fue tranquila en líneas generales. La mayoría de los titularse realizó trabajos regenerativos en pos de bajar cargas luego de un duelo en el que el cuadro de la RIbera debió jugar con 10 jugadores, durante gran parte del segundo tiempo, por la expulsión de Milton Delgado. La buena noticia es que Jorge Nicolás Figal, que aún no sumó minutos desde la vuelta del receso de la Copa América por una lesión, comenzó a hacer ejercicios futbolísticos en espacios reducidos. Si bien no está confirmada su participación ante la Gloria, es posible que regrese al terreno de juego para las fechas previas a la disputa de la siguiente ronda del certamen continental, señalada para mediados de agosto ante Cruzeiro de Brasil. Tampoco se puede descartar la aparición de Aaron Anselmino , vendido a Chelsea por 18 millones de dólares pero a préstamo en Boca durante un año más, en la próxima convocatoria luego de superar un desgarro y sumarse a la par del grupo. No obstante, viajará en breve a realizarse la revisión médica para aprobar su pase al equipo inglés, que realiza su pretemporada en Atlanta. Sin embargo, el foco estará puesto en los entrenamientos venideros de Edinson Cavani y Marcos Rojo. Ambos terminaron el cotejo ante el Matagigantes al límite físicamente y Diego Martínez podría resguardarlos para no forzar una lesión. El uruguayo, autor del gol de la clasificación, se había perdido la ida a causa de una molestia muscular y se ausentó del empate ante Defensa y Justicia en Florencio Varela con el objetivo de llegar óptimo a La Bombonera. Por su parte, el platense acusó un problema intercostal en el primer chico contra el cuadro ecuatoriano y también tuvo que saltearse el compromiso de la sexta fecha de la Liga Profesional para decir presente en la vuelta. Si bien todavía restan dos prácticas más y el viaje a Córdoba, no está asegurada la titularidad de dos de los emblemas del once habitual de Boca. Hay que tomar en consideración que el Xeneize disputará el próximo miércoles el partido postergado contra Banfield en La Bombonera, correspondiente a la séptima jornada del torneo local. La formación que podría probar Diego Martínez en Boca vs. Instituto Sergio Romero: Luis Advíncula, Cristian Lema, Gary Medel, Lautaro Blanco; Tomás Belmonte, Pol Fernández, Milton Delgado o Mauricio Benítez, Brian Aguirre; Milton Giménez y Miguel Merentiel. ¿Fanático del Xeneize?

    "text": "The Chief Imam of Daaru Na’im Central Mosque, Sheikh Imran Abdulmajeed Eleha, has cautioned beneficiaries of zakat disbursement against abusing the gesture by turning themselves into permanent recipients of the proceeds. The Saudi Arabia-trained Nigeria-born scholar said the purpose of zakat was to empower the less-privileged, who should utilise whatever they get judiciously. Eleha was speaking at the ninth edition of Zakat and Sadaqah disbursement of Jaiz Charity and Development Foundation, one of Nigeria’s leading faith-based poverty alleviation and empowerment non-governmental organisation (NGO) known for putting smiles on the faces of the needy. The event, which was held at Beleke Smith Memorial Mosque, Surulere, saw the disbursement of a total sum of N15m to 165 beneficiaries grouped into four different categories. In his lecture, Sheikh Eleha explained that zakat was one of the empowerment and anti-poverty strategies established by the Shari’a, thereby warning against abuse of the privilege by beneficiaries. “The purpose of zakat is to empower the less-privileged persons. Therefore, once you are selected as a beneficiary, you are to use the money or zakat item judiciously. It is not ideal for people to abuse the zakat by turning themselves into permanent recipients. The best thing is for the beneficiaries to strive to reciprocate the gesture by paying back in the coming years. “During the time of Umar Ibn Abdulazeez, one of the Caliphs of Islam, the Ummah disbursed zakat for two years, and people had become so empowered that in the following year (which is the third), nobody had cause to receive zakat.” Sheikh Eleha noted the huge challenge of poverty and hunger bedevilling Nigerian society is due to our low application of zakat as a strategy to empower the less- privileged . He said: “The Islamic community must have arrangements for empowering Muslims. ..” The Shari’a has established many ways including sadaqah, zakat and others. It is because we do not follow these ways properly that we are still facing a huge challenge of hunger and poverty today.” He commended the Jaiz Foundation and other Islamic organisations administrating the collection and disbursement of zakat in Nigeria, noting they are preserving the Shari’a. “We must commend the job that organisations like Jaiz Foundation are doing to preserve the Shari’a in the area of zakat and sadaqah administration. May the Almighty Allah reward them abundantly for emancipating the less privileged ones in the society,” he said. Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer of the foundation, Dr. Abdullahi Shuaib, revealed that beneficiaries of this year’s zakat disbursement cut across different segments including education, health, economic empowerment, and welfare, among others. According to him, “At today’s event, no fewer than 165 indigent Nigerians will be presented with cheques and tools worth N15 million for economic empowerment, health, livelihood, educational intervention, among others. “The sum of N6.4 million was earmarked for the economic empowerment category comprising 32 beneficiaries. Similarly, while the sum of N4.5m went for education support, N2.8m was awarded for humanitarian support. 6 beneficiaries shared the sum of N1.7m in the health category,” he added. The Jaiz Foundation CEO appreciated the Zakat payers for their unwavering support and generous donations over the years while urging other wealthy individuals to fulfil the obligation. “We ask Allah to continue to bless the zakat payers’ wealth, families and enterprises as they continue to support the cause of Allah and humanity,” Dr Shuaib added. 0 Comments [cancel reply](/news/muslim-cleric-urges-judicious-application-of-zakat-proceeds-2/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.

    "title": "Social Media In Amhara Politics: Disinformation And Misinformation In An Existential Struggle – OpEd",
    "text": "Introduction There is nothing new in voicing concerns over the possible negative effects of social media. Indeed, there is nothing particularly original in stating that these drawbacks are categorical. What is less often mentioned, however, is how the normalization of misinformation and disinformation – two of the main ulcers afflicting social media – causes much more than extreme views and polarized politics. In some cases, its negative effects can be measured in blood.\nMy interest here is to reflect on the vicious and toxic interactions that currently dominate social media interactions around Amhara politics and its struggle. I have been actively observing these interactions on Facebook, TikTok, Twitter (X) and WhatsApp accounts via group meetings. Of particular concern is understanding why the civility of conversation –even online conversation– has reached such low standards of decency. These social platforms and online forums are rife with aggressive and abusive interactions, dominated by shocking political statements that flirt with murder and larger calls for mass killings. What should have been a positive social movement to defend Amhara interests in the face of state-sanctioned persecution from the current Ethiopian government seems to have degenerated into a cesspit of inner-accusiations, chauvinistic declarations and mob abuse against other Amharas who voiced ever so slightly differing views. This toxic online environment is not only hurtful for users, it is also affecting the Fano insurgency.\nFor example, some observers suggest that social media sites spur greater schadenfreude —the emotional experience of pleasure in response to another’s misfortune—perhaps as a result of the dehumanization that occurs when interacting through screens on computers and mobile devices . Some studies also suggest a strong tie between heavy social media use and increased depression , anxiety , loneliness and feelings of inadequacy. However, in the case of the Amhara politics, there is an intentional, organised and malicious agenda. Of course, some of the participants involved in the spread of misinformation and fake news may have some personal scores to settle, too.\nPsychologists have observed that we lose some of our usual inhibitions when communicating online, especially when our identity is unknown. That can work well to open up debate, but it also removes the social barriers to saying hurtful things. I personally have a first-hand experience that lasted two weeks, a campaign against my character for reasons I still do not understand. It is my belief that the online disinhibition effect has caused immense damage not only to innocent and committed Fano supporters but also to the overall Fano struggle.\nThe toxic comments expressed in the social media largely fall into two categories: hate speech and online harassment (aka trolling). I personally experienced both categories, and that is one of the motivations I am encouraged to write this.\nThere is a vigorous debate over what constitutes hate speech, but the United Nations defines it as “any kind of communication that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor”. The hate speech that we observe with regard to the Amhara struggle for freedom is now vigorously directed at Fano leaders. The intention is to create discord and divisiveness among them. I strongly believe that the Ethiopian government is partly behind this campaign of sowing animosity and distrust, which is then also distributed by less informed and reckless people with no critical thinking. To further compound this problem, the resulting toxic online environment means that intelligent supporters of the Amhara struggle are afraid of expressing their views in public or social media. The reason is that they could not stand the character assassination for expressing their views. One distinguished academic was participating in a Twitter feed/conversation and decided to share his views on the roots of ‘Amhara demonisation’. His views were well presented and explained: some people may have partly disagreed or perhaps wanted to contribute to further the point: in other words, the natural progression of a discussion. However, one loud-mouthed participant attacked him for his comments with a torrent of abuse. If this had been a real debate, it would have been the equivalent of a member of the audience suddenly standing up, interrupting him and shouting a long list of profanities. The old academic swiftly left the space, disappointed by his experience and vowing to never repeat it. One less contribution to the Fano struggle.\nI have not seen him in any forum since then. I tried to convince the professor that the young man who viciously attacked him is uncultured or sent by the Ethiopian government to silence you. This is typical of Totalitarian regime’s modes operando. When George Orwell coined the term “totalitarianism,” he had not lived in a totalitarian regime but was merely imagining what it might look like. He referred to two primary traits of totalitarian societies (1): one is lying (or misinformation), and the other is what he called “schizophrenia.” Orwell wrote:\n“The organised lying practiced by totalitarian states is not, as it is sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the same nature as military deception. It is something integral to totalitarianism, something that would still continue even if concentration camps and secret police forces had ceased to be necessary.” Orwell argues that totalitarianism makes literature impossible. By literature, he means all kinds of writing in prose, from imaginative fiction to political journalism; he suggests that verse might slip through the cracks. He writes, too, that there is such a thing as “groups of people who have adopted a totalitarian outlook”—single-truth communities of sorts, not just totalitarian regimes or entire countries. These are deadly to literature as well. What we see in Amhara politics is “groups of people who have adopted a totalitarian outlook”.\nMy Personal Account A family member has just informed me that during the past four years or so I have written 67 articles and 2 books on the Amhara Genocide, Amhara displacement, ethnic cleansing and the Fano struggle. I was the first to write a peer reviewed article on the history of Fano and valour. There was none before that. (2) I was interviewed by foreign and local media to explain what Fano stands for. In those two widely read articles, I have clearly outlined the central concepts of my thesis. These are: Traditionally, the Fano struggle had focused on fending off attacks against Ethiopia. In recent years, Fano has become a household name, and a crucial movement tasked with saving the very existence of the Amhara population as well as the integrity of Ethiopia . On my recent article I argued that Fano is, first and foremost, fighting for the survival of the Amhara people against whom the Abiy regime has launched a war with chilling echoes of ethnic persecution under a tailor-made state-of-emergency law. Fano upholds, as the songs and poems vividly describe, the equality of all the 85 languages and ethnic groups of Ethiopia under Ethiopianism and is therefore steadfastly pro-Ethiopia. Fano is thus, so to speak, the military wing of the majority of Ethiopians and therefore waging a people’s war against the revanchist, hegemonic, and ethno-nationalist Abiy regime. Currently, the balance of power appears to be in favor of the Abiy regime in terms of arms and finance but at the end of the day, it is people who use the arms and finance to fight and win the war. A good example of this is the fact that thousands of the regime army are surrendering to the Fano with their advanced weaponry, disillusioned with the war. Fano has the people, and they will take the arms and put them in the hands of the people where they should belong and win the war for themselves and Ethiopia. It is thus a matter of time before Fano decisively wins the war and seizes central power. Already the course of the war has turned decisively in Favor of Fano, which has won every ground battle it has fought with the Abiy regime so far. The yardsticks used to make the above conclusion are based on 1) cause and morale 2) general war strategy 3) intelligence network 4) logistics and terrain 5) provisions. I also dedicated a couple of articles to the late Fano Molla Melaku and Fano Eshete Moges. (Both lost their lives in action)\nIn a recent article that I published online I urged people to unite in one ‘Centralised Fano Structure’, regardless of who is heading such central structure. I also urged people to avoid fragmentation, parochial thinking or having a limited or narrow outlook or scope that limits the Fano campaign in line with my two theses above. This suggestion or advice was taken out of its context by vicious people. They implied that I was encouraging a fight between Fano groups. It is quite a shocking accusation because it is the exact opposite of what I state in my article. What disappointed me is the large number who can be easily deceived and share the information with out checking the authenticity of the information.\nA recent article Why people get more stupid in a crowd (3) said it all . Group conformity stands in marked contrast to the “wisdom of crowds” effect, whereby aggregating the opinions of large numbers of people gives answers or predictions more accurate than those of any individual. This happens only when members of a crowd make their judgements independently of each other, and it is most effective when a crowd is diverse. In cohesive groups, on the other hand, where members share an identity, the urge for unity overrides all. So, when Richardson presents us with a picture of a killer whale and asks us how much the creature weighs, he’ll be better off taking the average of the answers we give independently, rather than following the scramble of dots on the screen. We think of the internet as an information superhighway, …. a bias superhighway.\nIn our struggle for Amhara freedom, social media enables every individual to become a publisher, communicating true or false information instantly and globally. In the ‘post-truth’ era, deception is commonplace at all levels of contemporary life. Fakery affects the struggle and social information undermining trust among our Fano leaders and the capacity of individuals and society to make evidence-informed choices, including on life-or-death issues. In the battle for truth, we all must speak out against false information and fake videos in circulation and forcefully contradict so called activists who promote it. The well informed and educated Ethiopians must contribute to facts and knowledge that help understand and counter false information, to education that builds knowledge and skills in assessing information and to strengthening science literacy in society.\nThe legendary German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (4), whom the Nazis executed less than a month before the end of World War II, once offered this fascinating comparison of stupidity and malice: “Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless.” In our day and age of mass stupidity, it’s hard to disagree with Bonhoeffer’s viewpoint. In day-to-day life, a stupid person can drain you of your most valuable personal resources, including time, energy, and money. But when it comes to political and geopolitical affairs, stupid people can damage entire nation. That is what is happening in Ethiopia and it is causing immense damage to the Fano movement. In a recent article titled Is the Amhara diaspora an obstacle or a help to Amhara’s survival struggle in Ethiopia? (5) the author has aptly captured the phenomenon: ‘Indeed, Amhara diaspora politics is dominated by selfish or less educated orators who nominated themselves as chief political analysts by force, regardless of expertise. Social media and even mainstream outlets dominated and misused by these people to harm or hijack the struggle’.\nChallenges and opportunities in the Fano struggle As mentioned earlier the unchecked social media is getting out of control. Ideally Social media platforms do offer social value. Facebook’s mission statement begins by claiming its purpose is “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” Social interaction is fundamental to our humanity. It is the means through which we create our very worlds. Communication media are crucial in shaping our futures. At their best, social media would help us build better worlds. They would help us become better humans. But social media cannot foster more just societies when their primary goals are growth and profit. Better societies cannot be built on models of humans as data profiles to be matched with advertisers. (6) However, in Fano struggle the social media tools are mostly and actively and intensively used to weaken the movement and cause distrust among the Fano leaders and fighters.\nThe TikTok actors and Facebook “activists” are the worst in creating false narratives and mocking the Fano leaders and the gallant fighters. Their audiences are huge compared to serious educative and informative platforms. Both disinformation and misinformation are generated primarily in those popular networks. Youtubers are scrambling for information from the battlefield. They want to be the first to report. Fano leaders are interviewed constantly regardless of the security matters, or without adequate cyber security protections.\nCurrently, what is severely impacting the movement is disinformation and misinformation. (7) Both can have significant impacts, but disinformation is particularly harmful due to its intentional nature. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is spread without the intent to deceive. This can happen when someone shares incorrect information believing it to be true. For example, if someone mistakenly shares a wrong date for an event, they are spreading misinformation. Disinformation, on the other hand, is deliberately false information created and spread with the intention to mislead or deceive others. This can include propaganda, hoaxes, or malicious content designed to manipulate public opinion or obscure the truth. Even though misinformation, disinformation, and fake news are not new phenomena, they have received renewed interest since political events such as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections. In the Ethiopian case, these phenomena are becoming disastrous, costing human lives and creating bloody war among brothers and sisters.\nOne other challenge is the phenomenon of self-appointed experts on the Amhara struggle, fano fighting and political and military structures. They have no talent or ability at all. All over the Internet, I am amazed by all the ‘experts, gurus and ninjas’ on Ethiopian matters. My question is, where do we go to get certified as an expert? Most of us who understand the complexities of Ethiopian politics are either shy or reserved. And the exhibitionists and shallow people took the arena. And the sad thing is there is no one to correct them. As I noted most people seem to be content with these shallow peoples’ simple, unproblematised messages and currently the internet entertainers have monopolized the information flow with their blunt and immoral jokes. Unfortunately, there are spectators, in millions. One can only imagine the cost to our people. I strongly believe that there should be a sort of “expert police” among us. As Eyob Tilahun (2024) correctly pointed that ‘the elite group was expected to shape the orbit of struggle and point forth a strategic direction for freedom fighters. Unfortunately, the role of elites in the survival struggle is negligible. Even though they have a less negative role in the survival struggle, they are responsible for their silence instead of being a voice for the voiceless people of Amhara. Being silent at this time is immoral and it is time to react’.\nWe need to be brave to voice the danger of unsubstantiated comments and opinions about the battle front because the Internet is infested with exhibitionists, imposters, false experts. These are the last things the struggle needs. I was once to write about why the Amhara struggle attracted these segments (so called activists) of our population. They are too many. I can list at least 20 to 30 notorious ones. My preliminary diagnosis of their behaviour is that many of them are unstable, jobless and perhaps have a history of mental issues. Sadly, these traits have quaified them as chief influencers of online public opinion. It is time for the decent segments of the population to empower themselves and correct the derailed path before it is too late.\nAccording to Eyob Tilahun (2024 July 31), disgustingly, some diasporas deliberately or unknowingly disseminate hatred and divisive ideas among Amhara and unsubstantiated garbage-in, garbage-out ideas without critical analysis. Even some who called themselves educated demarcated themselves at village-level insight instead of united Amhara. Some of the Amhara diasporas intentionally or naively served as weapons of Abiy’s regime. Freedom fighters on the ground welcome unbiased comments and suggestions from the diaspora based on evidence. However, meritless and unfair criticism, the tendency to hijack the survival struggle, and unnecessary interference to twist the hands of freedom fighters for personal interests are completely unacceptable and should be stopped. The diaspora should only play a supportive role, not a decisive one.\nFinally, as UNESCO warned, Social media poses ‘existential threat’ to traditional, trustworthy news. In the Ethiopian case it poses existential threat to the Amhara people. Social media platforms must adopt safeguards to prioritize fact-based information to stop foreign and domestic adversaries from spreading false or misleading information about the Amhara people and Fano fighters. Many of these social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, can be hotspots for spreading hurtful rumours, lies, and abuse that can leave lasting scars in the survival struggle.\n“The truth is still the truth, even if no one believes it.

[PTI](https://www.devdiscourse.com/pti-stories)| Albany | Updated: 01-01-2024 11:09 IST | Created: 01-01-2024 11:04 IST - Country: - United States New York's minimum-wage workers had more than just the new year to celebrate on Monday, with a pay bump kicking in as the clock ticked over to 2024. In the first of a series of annual increases slated for the Empire State, the minimum wage increased to USD 16 in New York City and some of its suburbs, up from USD 15. In the rest of the state, the new minimum wage is USD 15, up from USD 14.20. The state's minimum wage is expected to increase every year until it reaches USD 17 in New York City and its suburbs, and USD 16 in the rest of the state by 2026. Future hikes will be tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a measurement of inflation. New York is one of 22 states getting minimum wage rises in the new year, according to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute. In California, the minimum wage increased to USD 16, up from USD 15.50, while in Connecticut it increased to USD 15.69 from the previous rate of USD 15. This most recent pay bump in New York is part of an agreement made last year between Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Legislature. The deal came over the objections of some employers, as well as some liberal Democrats who said it didn't go high enough. The federal minimum wage in the United States has stayed at USD 7.25 per hour since 2009, but states and some localities are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states, including New Mexico and Washington, have done so. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
