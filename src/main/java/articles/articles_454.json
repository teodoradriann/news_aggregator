    "title": "Former SBC Seminary Administrator Charged With Falsifying Records in DOJ Sexual Abuse Investigation",
    "text": "Matthew Queen, a former administrator and professor for Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, has been charged with falsification of records. The United States Attorney’s Office alleges that Queen sought to cover up a report of sexual abuse that occurred at the Southern Baptist affiliated seminary in 2022.\nThe announcement comes amid the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) ongoing investigation of Southern Baptist entities.\nSouthern Baptist leaders were made aware of the DOJ’s probe in 2022 shortly after the release of a\nGuidepost Solutions report, which revealed the failures of the denomination’s Executive Committee to properly respond to reports of sexual abuse across a 20-year period.\nRELATED:\nSurvivors Say DOJ Investigation Into SBC Executive Committee Is Not Closed\nIn a\nstatement released by the United States Attorney’s Office on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said, “Matthew Queen, an interim Provost, allegedly failed to inform the FBI of a conspiracy to destroy evidence related to the ongoing investigation of sexual misconduct and instead produced falsified notes to investigators.”\n“Queen’s alleged actions deliberately violated a court order and delayed justice for the sexual abuse victims,” Smith continued. “The FBI will never tolerate those who intentionally lie and mislead our investigation in an attempt to conceal their malicious behavior.”\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office said that shortly after the DOJ opened its investigation, Southwestern Seminary received a report of sexual abuse committed by a student. While an administrator contacted campus police, the incident was not reported to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office further alleges that a seminary employee created a document in January 2023 that described the failure of Southwestern Seminary “to take action regarding the allegation at that time” but that the document was ordered destroyed by a member of the school’s executive staff during a meeting where Queen was present.\nQueen later produced notes that he said were from the meeting but that investigators believe to be falsified. In those notes, Queen stated that the two other seminary employees merely discussed giving the report to another department of the seminary.\nWhile Queen originally told investigators that the notes were written shortly after the meeting in January 2023, he later said that he wrote them in April 2023. Investigators believe Queen “had written the notes following his initial May 2023 interview with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI.”\nRELATED:\nBruce Frank Running for SBC President With a Focus on a ‘Tenacity With Sexual Abuse Reform’\nIn a\nhttps://swbts.edu/news/statement-on-department-of-justice-announcement/ also released on Tuesday, Southwestern Seminary said that it “has and will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ in its investigation of sexual abuse.”",

The guest should have headed to the hotel gym, which was open at the time.\nBut, for heaven’s sake, keep it down in the hallway.",

    "text": "Miami, Florida – January 24, 2020 (Shutterstock)\nALBAWABA – In a shocking turn of events, officials at Paris Orly Airport discovered an undocumented passenger hidden in the landing gear of an Air Algeria aircraft. Reports indicate that the stowaway is in critical condition and has been promptly admitted to a nearby medical facility.\nThe flight, originating from the Algerian city of Oran, lasted approximately two and a half hours, raising concerns about the perilous conditions endured by stowaways in the landing gear compartments.\nThe extreme temperatures ranging from minus 50 to minus 60 degrees Celsius during flight, combined with potential oxygen depletion at high altitudes, pose severe risks.\nThis incident is not an isolated occurrence. Similar incidents in the past have underscored the grave dangers faced by those attempting clandestine journeys in aircraft landing gear compartments.\nIn 2015, a stowaway’s lifeless body fell from a British Airways plane traveling from Johannesburg to London, and in 2019, another suspected stowaway’s body was discovered in southwest London. These instances highlight the inherent risks and challenges associated with such perilous endeavors.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info).",

    "text": "At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said. The crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district. A large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital. At least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Quran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader. \"They burned one house and lynched several Christians,\" Bhatti aid. Videos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street. Bhatti said the videos were images from the scene. Reuters could not independently verify the pictures. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\". Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores. While blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs. A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Quran.",

The way experts look at and characterize grief is changing, including the newly recognized prolonged grief disorder. Experiencing grief is different for each person. For some, it's an outward expression of action, while others may internalize the emotion. It can last for an extended period of time, impacting day-to-day life. [Prolonged grief disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/prolonged-grief-disorder) is a recently-recognized diagnosis for someone who is experiencing \"persistent pervasive symptoms\" one year after a death, social worker Clara Sainte told KCUR's Up To Date. \"So beyond our cultural norms, beyond what we would expect grief to look like,\" Sainte said. Grief can come in waves, and it's important for others to be supportive with no timeline or expectations of when it should end or how it should look. \"The majority of the work in my office isn't about the death itself, or the cancer, or the trauma. It's about the lack of the way people show up,\" Sainte said.

    "text": "The NHS has offered children with severe epilepsy brain surgery before medicinal cannabis, parents have revealed. Several families have told the Mail that their children were offered the “incredibly invasive procedure” which involves separating one side of the brain from the other and can cause vision loss. One mother refused the operation, which costs the NHS up to £33,400, and requested medicinal cannabis oil, which was legalized five years ago and has been shown to be effective with epileptic children. The oils are given orally every day and three children in the UK have NHS prescriptions, with successful results. But other young people with similar conditions have been denied, leaving parents paying up to £2,000 a month to obtain the medication privately, while others cannot access it at all. Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, (pictured together) was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer (concentrated cannabis oil file photo) Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family said they were warned this was “life-threatening”, that Alfie could lose his peripheral vision and would need weeks of rehabilitation to learn to walk again. Mrs Griffin said: “I don’t want to have to go to him and say we know it didn’t work… I want to say we’ve done everything we could, Alf, we did everything we could, why not do it?” Try medical cannabis first? The family, from Peterborough, have been refused Epidiolex on the NHS and private clinics that prescribe other oils cannot help. In October, the Mail revealed that two families were smuggling cannabis oil from the Netherlands in suitcases, as the pharmacy that supplied their private prescription did not have enough stock. Ms Griffin said obtaining the drug privately may not even be an option as they would struggle to keep up with the large monthly payments. ‘Even if we could (get it privately), how long can we sustain £2,000 a month? Not for long because we would have to sell the house,” the mother said. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer. She said: ‘We are absolutely stuck. They were alone. “We have no support.” Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately (file photo of scientist checking hemp plants in a greenhouse) The Mail has spoken to two other families whose epileptic children were offered brain surgery. “You can’t reverse brain surgery, so it seems crazy,” one mother said. Caroline Gisbourne’s 16-year-old son Mitchell underwent the procedure before medical cannabis was legalized in 2018, but it didn’t work and he is now using the oils successfully. She said: “If I had known about medicinal cannabis oils before, there would be no way to put him through the operation.” Brain surgery costs to the NHS depend on the age of the patients and the complexity of the procedure, but typically range between £7,800 and £33,400. Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately. A spokesperson for NHS England said: “The decision to proceed with surgery… would be made jointly by a clinical team and the patient’s family and/or carers.”",
