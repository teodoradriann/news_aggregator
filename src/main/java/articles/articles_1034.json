    "text": "The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) has today escalated its response to severe storms impacting Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria since 23 December, declaring an Insurance Catastrophe. This decision reflects the escalating severity of the situation, the high volume of claims already received, and the anticipated impact of further extreme weather events forecast for the coming days. The ICA's Catastrophe declaration serves to escalate and prioritise the insurance industry's response for affected policyholders. Under the Catastrophe declaration: - Claims from affected policyholders will be given priority by insurers. - Claims will be triaged to direct urgent assistance to the worst-affected property owners. - ICA representatives will be mobilised to work with local agencies and services and affected policyholders as soon as emergency services say it is safe to do so. - Insurers will mobilise disaster response specialists to assist affected customers with claims and assessments as soon as emergency services say it is safe to do so. - An industry taskforce has been established to identify and address issues arising from this catastrophe. - The insurance industry has made this Catastrophe Declaration to activate services and support for affected homeowners and businesses and reassure them that their insurer is there to help. As of today, insurers had received 18,174 claims related to the storms across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with 10,716 claims in the Gold Coast region alone. Access to storm-damaged areas remains hampered by ongoing power outages. The Insurance Council urge homeowners and business owners whose property or vehicle has been impacted to contact their insurer as soon as possible to initiate the claims process, even if the full extent of the damage is unclear. For those beginning cleanup efforts, they are not obligated to retain damaged property, including carpets and furnishings. Simply take photos, record any identifying information, and keep material samples for claims purposes. Quote attributable to ICA COO Kylie Macfarlane: Given the immense scale and destructive nature of these storms across eastern Australia, the Insurance Council and insurers are escalating our response to a Catastrophe level to better serve the immediate and future needs of our customers. Insurers expect claims volumes to grow in the coming days as more residents gain access to properties and power is restored to some areas, however, it is too early to understand the cost of the damage. We encourage residents to put their safety and the safety of their family first and contact their insurer if they need immediate financial assistance.

    "text": "A young man had his head buried in his phone, when he looked up he had\nkilled a beloved father and injured his son.Peter Agius sent 44 Snapchats while driving just 12 kilometres, at 100km/h down a busy Victorian country road.\nHe received 41 replies, including one 20 seconds before the deadly crash.\nHis victim, Adam Sutton, had just picked his six-year-old son up from school when they were struck by Agius' vehicle in January 2023.\nSutton died at the scene, while his son was taken to hospital with critical injuries and left with a permanent brain injury.\nCounty Court Judge Kevin Doyle labelled Agius' offending as \"extreme inattention\" as he threw him behind bars for at least six years today.\n\"A life was lost and a young child's life has been damaged by your actions,\" the judge told Agius, aged 23, who cried upon learning his fate.\nAgius had fought the two charges, of culpable driving causing death and negligently causing serious injury, at a jury trial in regional Victoria.\nHe claimed to have dropped his sunglasses while driving, and looked down to pick them up, when the crash occurred.\nHis lawyers argued Agius should be convicted of dangerous driving causing death and serious injury, not the more serious charges.\nBut prosecutors argued Agius was not paying attention to the road because he was sending and receiving dozens of Snapchat messages while driving, which was grossly negligent behaviour.\nAnalysis of Agius' phone revealed he sent and received 85 Snapchat messages while driving about 12 kilometres from his worksite to the crash scene, at the intersection of Traralgon-Maffra and Farmers roads in\nGlengarry.A jury ultimately convicted Agius of the culpable and negligent driving charges in April 2025.\nJudge Doyle said Agius was \"an accident waiting to happen\" and would have seen Sutton waiting to turn right if he was paying attention.\n\"The duty of every driver is to pay proper attention to the road - you didn't do that,\" he said.\nAgius had a history of dangerous driving, including a fine and loss of licence for dangerous driving while being pursued by police in 2022.\nIn 2020, he was ordered to undertake a road trauma awareness course for careless driving.\nAnd in February 2024, he was caught driving while on bail for the offending which caused Sutton's death, after he had been banned.\n\"Twice before this catastrophic collision, you had engaged in incredibly stupid driving offences,\" the judge said.\n\"You should have understood the basic duties of driving from these experiences, but you did not.\"\nSutton's loved ones told the court he was \"deeply loved as a husband, father, son, brother and friend to many people\", Judge Doyle said.\nLeanne Sutton said 1000 people attended her son's funeral, with 2000 watching online, and his death left \"an enormous void\" in the lives of all who knew him.\nHis father, Ray Sutton, said the pain and distress caused by Adam's death was \"indescribable\" and not a day went by that he did not think about \"the life sentence we've been given\".\nAgius was jailed for a maximum of nine years and eight months, and has served 122 days of that sentence.\nHe will be eligible for parole after serving six years.\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

    "title": "Thousands without power as heatwave replaces storms",
    "text": "Power outages in parts of south-east Queensland were expected to last nearly a week after deadly wild weather cut supplies and weather conditions remained hot and stormy.\nTens of thousands of people on the Gold Coast and other regions south of Brisbane were expected to be without electricity on the New Year weekend after damage caused by storms that lashed a vast swath of Australia’s east coast starting around Christmas.\nStorms cut power in south-east Queensland.\nMaking things worse, the region was due to be hit by a heatwave that forecasters said would extend across northern Australia and could bring temperatures in the 40s.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43 degrees on Friday, while temperatures of up to 37 degrees were forecast for Gympie in the storm-ravaged south-east and 36 degrees in Brisbane, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nIn the Northern Territory, it was predicted to reach 40 degrees in Katherine and 43 degrees in Tennant Creek, while at Marble Bar in Western Australia’s Pilbara region 49 degrees was expected.\nAdvertisement Seven people died in Queensland as wild weather lashed the south-east, including at least people caught in stormwater drains. In Victoria, two people were killed by falling branches and a third drowned in flash flooding after wild weather lashed the state around Christmas.\nFederal Disaster and Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said south-east Queensland residents should look out for neighbours who were elderly or living with disability.\n“If you have fans or air conditioning available and have got the power on, today is the day to use it,” Senator Watt said on Thursday.\n“If you don’t have that, today is the day to think about using those public libraries, public pools, other spaces to stay safe.”\nMore than 120,000 homes and businesses lost power during extreme rain, lightning and wind.\nQueensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said 63 per cent of customers without power since Monday and Tuesday’s “unprecedented” storms now had their services restored, and officials aimed to increase that rate to 80 per cent by Saturday.\nAdvertisement But more than 43,000 people were still without power on Thursday afternoon.\nHealth Minister Shannon Fentiman said this was “incredibly concerning”, with high temperatures expected over the coming days.\n“Use a cold towel or if there is power on at the local library or at a shopping centre, go there and just keep your temperature down if you’re starting to experience some signs and symptoms of heat stress,” she said.\nThe Gold Coast council announced its pools would be open and made free on Friday during the extreme heat.\nAAP\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Extreme weather\nGold Coast\nClimate crisis\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Energy Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Companies",

According to a report released by the Veterans Administration, military veteran suicides are down slightly but remain persistently steady. File Photo by Bonnie Cash/UPI Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Military veteran suicides are down slightly but remain persistently steady, according to a report released by the Veterans Administration on Thursday.\nNearly 18 veterans died by suicide every day in 2022, the latest data available. The number remained steady from the previous year but dropped slightly from a high of about 18.5 in 2018.\nThere are \"encouraging\" signs of progress among women and younger veterans, according to the VA's 2024 annual suicide prevention report . It's the most comprehensive national report on veteran suicide, analyzing suicide by veterans from 2001-2022.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement In 2022, 6,407 veterans died by suicide , compared with 6,404 in 2021, a rate of roughly 34.7 per 100,000.\n\"[There are] notable changes within the data in terms of increase or decreases in veteran suicide prevention that provide aspects of hope regarding progress,\" said Matthew Miller, executive director for the VA's Suicide Prevention Office.\nThe 34.7 per 100,000 suicide rate among U.S. veterans was more than twice as high as the non-veteran population of 17.1 per 100,000.\nThe deaths included 6,136 male veterans -- a 1.4% increase from the previous year -- and 271 female veterans, a decline of 24% from 2021. The suicide rate among homeless veterans, which has been notoriously high and receives extensive media and government attention, dropped 19.1% in the latest data.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Veterans in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic saw a 4% reduction.\nThe number of veterans who died in the same year that they left active duty dropped overall from a rate of 51 per 100,000 in 2021 to 46.2 per 100,000 in 2022, but was up sharply among Marines over other branches of service.\nMarines had a death rate of 67.9 per 100,000 \"person years\" -- a data point that incorporates the number of members and their time in service for the year.\nThe death rates for the other branches with members who recently left the service were 47 per 100,000 for the Navy , 38.8 per 100,000 for the Army , and 38.1 for the Air Force , which includes Space Force data, according to reporting by Military.com .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Wisconsin school shooter was in contact with a California man accused of planning separate attack, report says CNN Passengers panic as American Airlines flight ‘floods’ in midair: ‘New fear unlocked’ NY Post Ex-Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson facing warrants for arrest in Texas USA TODAY Sports Highest-earning NYPD cop with OT-fueled $400,000 salary retires following Daily News exposé NY Daily News \"This information raises concern about the unique challenges faced by Marine Corps veterans and highlights the necessity for specialized support systems tailored to their specific needs,\" Miller said.\nThe VA has spent more than $17 billion on veteran suicide prevention programs, up from $13 billion in 2022, according to the Congressional Research Service .\nIf you or someone you know is suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads",

There is a reason why children do not generally commence primary school until the age of five. Equally, because of the long process required for full cognitive development, a child’s capacity to understand the implications of certain decisions is significantly limited. This is why, as a society, we have minimum age limits for various activities – to prevent our children from coming to undue harm. [There is a reason why a 10-year-old cannot open a bank account. There is a reason why a 12-year-old cannot sign up to Facebook. There is a reason why a 15-year-old cannot consent to having sex. There is a reason why a 17-year-old cannot buy a scratch card or drink alcohol in a pub. This is called child safeguarding.](/v3/r2/?url=aHR0cDovL3dhdmVsZW5ndGhwYXRjaC5jb20v) However, in the name of gender ideology, which has managed to infiltrate all areas of our society, we have seemingly thrown everything we know about both child development and child safeguarding out of the window. This week, it [emerged](/v3/r2/?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xMi8yNi90YXZpc3RvY2stdHJhbnNnZW5kZXItY2xpbmljLWNoaWxkcmVuLWFnZWQtdGhyZWUtbmhzLw==) that 382 children aged six and below were referred to the now defunct Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock clinic in London over the past decade. Even more shocking: over 70 of those children were aged just three or four. Of course, three-year-olds have no real concept of terms like biological sex or gender identity. Nor are they capable of communicating confusions about their ‘gender identity’ to those around them. Most likely, these children simply showed an interest in toys or clothing that are more commonly associated with the opposite sex. And this led to them being carted off to the Tavistock. I thought we had moved past the days of regressive gender stereotyping. It appears not. Nowadays, a young boy who likes the colour pink or a young girl who enjoys playing with Action Man may find themselves in a gender clinic, on the dubious basis that they are ‘trapped in the wrong body’. How these children came to be there may vary. Were they referred by a GP who believes that everyone has a unique gender identity? Did an activist charity scare the parents into believing their child might commit suicide if they do not transition? Was it a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, with the child’s parents seeking the positive attention and affirmation that comes with having a child who identifies as trans? But, in many ways, the reason is irrelevant, because the outcome is the same: those innocent children are likely to have come to serious harm. Spokespeople for the Tavistock have defended the referrals of these extremely young children. They say that kids of such a young age would not have received medical ‘treatment’. Instead, these toddlers and their families were apparently only provided with ‘support and advice’. But we now know that presenting at a gender clinic is often the first step on a slippery slope towards greater intervention and medicalisation. It can begin a process that moves inexorably on to puberty-blockers, cross-sex hormones and eventually surgery in later life. Even so-called social transitioning, when a child adopts a new name and pronouns or wears the clothes of the opposite sex, is not a neutral act. This was made clear back in 2022 in [the interim Cass review](/v3/r2/?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9jYXNzLmluZGVwZW5kZW50LXJldmlldy51ay93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAyMi8wMy9DYXNzLVJldmlldy1JbnRlcmltLVJlcG9ydC1GaW5hbC1XZWItQWNjZXNzaWJsZS5wZGY=), an independent government review into child gender services which ultimately brought about the closure of the Tavistock. Research shows that if a child begins to live as if they are the opposite sex, their discomfort with their actual sex is more likely to persist. The ‘trans’ three-year-olds of today could well become the irreversibly damaged teenagers and young adults of tomorrow. Their puberty blocked, fertility extinguished, perfectly healthy body parts chopped off. We have seen it all before. A gender clinic is no place for a three-year-old. We are witnessing the worst medical scandal for a generation. We must put a stop to it.

    "text": "[Redacción Mundo](/mundo) El martes 29 de octubre España vivió una aterradora jornada ante el arribo de la Dana (Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos) a la Comunidad Valenciana. En territorio ibérico hay polémica ante las medidas preventivas que podían tomar las autoridades, pues muchos ciudadanos exponen que la alerta meteorológica fue enviada tarde. (Vea también: [“Solo importáis vosotros”: emotivas portadas de medios en España por tragedia de la Dana](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/dana-espana-portadas-medios-valencia-por-tragedia-PP4056624)) Las redes sociales han sido de gran utilidad ante lo sucedido, teniendo en cuenta que muchos valencianos publicaron videos del momento en el que el nivel del agua empezó a subir en las calles.

El agua empezó a cubrir las calles de Valencia a las 7:38 p. m. y aunque muchos ya corrían, la alerta en mensaje de texto no había sido enviada. El agua ya venía con escombros y demás elementos que arrasó a su paso. 🇪🇸 | INUNDACIONES EN VALENCIA: Cómo empezó el desastre en Valencia antes de que los habitantes recibieran siquiera aviso.
