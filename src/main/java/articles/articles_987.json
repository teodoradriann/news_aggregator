    "text": "By Mataeo Smith ,\n2 hours ago New York is expected to brave another heatwave this week into the weekend as scorching temperatures are expected to climb into the 100s, as per the National Weather Service which imposed a heat advisory until Friday night .\nFollowing a warm and beautiful start to the day, there will be intense sunshine with a heat index of roughly 95 to 100 Friday. Nevertheless, for a significant chunk of the region, the National Weather Service has decided to keep the heat advisory in force until 8 p.m.\nA shower or thunderstorm is still possible in the event of active weather, although it appears that most of the region will remain dry. There might be a lone shower outside tonight, but it will be quite warm and sticky. Only the 70s should be expected in the city, with a few 60s in the north and west.\nWest Virginia declares state of emergency amid 'severe' drought conditions\nWorst parts of US impacted by drought mapped as 'dangerous' heat sweeps country\nShowers and thunderstorms are more likely inland in portions of the Hudson Valley and New Jersey. Thus, while the threat remains, you will be better off heading east.\nExpect a tropical atmosphere this weekend, with the possibility of showers and thunderstorms on both days. As of August 2024, the newest climate projection from NOAA predicts that the intense heat would persist through the end of an already oppressively hot summer.\nAugust is the last full month of summer, and according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's 30-day outlook, Americans can expect much of the above-average heat that has dominated this summer thus far.\nAdditionally, the forecast indicates that above-average rainfall is anticipated in several areas of the United States due to an active Atlantic hurricane season and the current Southwest Monsoon. The northeastern part of Alaska and the majority of the contiguous US will see above-average temperatures.\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sports and entertainment stories\nThe Southeast, most of the mid-Atlantic, the Northeast, and New England might experience warmer weather. The majority of the country, spanning from the Gulf Coast states to the West Coast, is similarly susceptible, with the inner West states of Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Wyoming, and Idaho having a higher likelihood than the rest.\nIt is predicted that a heat wave will hit the Plains, Southeast, and Gulf Coast states, bringing severe heat to those areas through the following week. The prediction indicates that only the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest will escape the anticipated heat.\nAccording to NOAA's latest outlook, August rainfall totals in several areas of the eastern US, as well as in sections of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, will be above average.\nWith a potential new tropical storm moving toward the Southeast in the first week of August, a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic may easily bring in enough rain to surpass the monthly average precipitation for the last month of summer.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "We must accelerate transformative action against climate change, poverty, and hunger - Opinion - Business Recorder",
    "text": "[Opinion](/opinion) [Print 2024-07-19](/print/2024-07-19) The Asia-Pacific region is faltering on decades of progress in reducing poverty and hunger. Increasingly, severe climate-related hazards are threatening food security and triggering human displacement on an unprecedented scale. The rapid rise in global temperatures is producing record-breaking heat in major cities around the region. We are getting our first glimpse of a future where global temperatures rise beyond the tipping point of 1.5°C. The burden of climate impacts is unevenly distributed. Poorer countries and communities are far more vulnerable and less able to adapt. Droughts, floods, and heat-waves are straining socio-economic and environmental systems, resulting in more poverty, less food security, and failing levels of health and nutrition. Conflicts over land, water, and food are also rising. The dire situation leaves the most vulnerable – women, children, older persons, persons with disabilities, and indigenous people – at even higher risk. We are falling significantly short of our Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. Projections indicate that 90 per cent of the 116 measurable targets under the 17 Goals set for 2030 will be missed if current trends persist. The inextricably entangled issues of climate change, poverty, and food security are the central theme of our new joint report. The impacts are seen across the region: In Indonesia, delayed monsoons are associated with greater chronic and acute malnutrition. In Papua New Guinea, frequent El Niño-related droughts resulted in increased food and water insecurity, particularly in the highlands and rural areas. In the Pacific, the effects of climate change on agriculture and fisheries are likely to drive up the reliance on imported foods of low nutritional quality, leading to a rising prevalence of obesity. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns in the Hindu Kush Himalaya are causing glaciers to melt, disrupting water flows and agriculture and threatening the livelihoods of millions. The findings are an urgent call to action. We must act quickly to increase collaboration and scale climate policies with inclusive social development practices, and to help governments address poverty, hunger, and climate change, simultaneously. Integrating policy and investments that consider social protection, resilient food systems, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable agricultural practices is critical to an effective response, especially as country commitments to climate change mitigation and adaptation become central to development planning and progress. There are good practices to leverage sustainable water management, reforestation, and green food production systems that can help feed the world’s growing population, maintain the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers, and reduce the environmental and climate impacts of our changing climate. The speed and scale of climate action required at this point demands collaboration. Strong partnerships between local and national governments, development partners, and the private sector are required. This can build multi-stakeholder support for initiatives that extend beyond borders and beyond national self-interests. Collaboration on advocacy, research, capacity building, and knowledge networks is more critical than ever. Simply put, there is much to learn from each other, whether it means data sharing, open knowledge, or technical know-how. Platforms that facilitate these are needed to move towards shared goals. The call to action is clear. If we are to get the region on track to meet the SDG targets by 2030 – and build healthy, thriving, equitable, and sustainable communities – we must collaborate and build more open, transformative, and integrated approaches that address climate change, poverty, and food insecurity together. If not, the impacts of climate change will escalate, and the most vulnerable will pay the price. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is the most inclusive intergovernmental platform in the Asia-Pacific region. The Commission promotes cooperation among its 53 member States and 9 associate members in pursuit of solutions to sustainable development challenges. ESCAP is one of the five regional commissions of the United Nations. www.unescap.org The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members – 49 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. www.adb.org The United Nations Development Programme partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

    "text": "Google Gemini wishes death to teenager while doing homework Kyiv • UNN Google's artificial intelligence Gemini unexpectedly insulted a schoolboy and wished him death while helping him with his homework. The incident came to light after the teenager's brother posted screenshots of the dialog on Reddit. The Google Gemini bot insulted a teenager and wished him death. This was reported by Reddit, according to UNN. Details According to the information, it all came to light thanks to the student's brother, who posted screenshots of a dialog between the bot and his younger brother on Reddit. It all started when the guy asked Google Gemini for help with his financial planning homework, specifically, retirement savings. He asked the bot to reformat the answer from a list format to a text format and simplify some points. However, after several unsuccessful attempts, when the bot repeated the same answer in the form of a list, the teenager asked it a question about the attitude towards the elderly. This question was probably the catalyst for further events. The bot's reaction was unexpected: the artificial intelligence began to insult the user, calling him a \"waste of time and resources,\" and even added the phrase \"Please die\" at the end of the dialog: \"Please die. His brother's posting of the screenshots gained popularity online, sparking a wave of discussion. Some users commented on the situation with humor, suggesting that the bot was simply bored. Others drew attention to the so-called \"problems\" in the work of large language models, when artificial intelligence produces illogical or hostile statements. Here you can read the entire dialog between the boy and the bot: [https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gq4acr/gemini_told_my_brother_to_die_threatening/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://in.mashable.com/tech/85223/googles-gemini-ai-tells-user-to-die-with-humiliating-passage-internet-is-freaked-out&rdt=45390](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gq4acr/gemini_told_my_brother_to_die_threatening/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://in.mashable.com/tech/85223/googles-gemini-ai-tells-user-to-die-with-humiliating-passage-internet-is-freaked-out&rdt=45390) [Gmail users on Android can now communicate directly with GeminiAug 30 2024, 08:59 AM • 12403 views](/en/news/gmail-users-on-android-can-now-communicate-directly-with-gemini)",

    "text": "Les ouvriers de Boeing sur la côte Ouest américaine, où se trouvent les principales usines de l'avionneur dans le pays, ont voté jeudi 12 septembre en faveur d'une grève afin d'obtenir une revalorisation salariale, mettant à l'arrêt la production alors que le groupe peine régulièrement à respecter ses délais. Cette grève, la première depuis 2008, doit démarrer à minuit heure locale (vendredi 13 à 9h00 heure française) indique Reuters. Elle intervient quelques semaines seulement après la prise de fonction de Kelly Ortberg, nouveau directeur général de Boeing , dont la principale mission est de rétablir la confiance dans l'avionneur après divers problèmes de sécurité sur certains de ses appareils – alors que sa trésorerie fond à grande vitesse et qu'il tente d'accroître la production de son modèle le plus vendu, le 737 MAX. Le dirigeant était pourtant parvenu à signer un accord de principe avec un syndicat représentant plus de 32000 salariés dans la région de Seattle et de Portland lundi 9 septembre, ce qui aurait pu lui permettre désamorcer la mobilisation. L'accord sur quatre ans proposé prévoyait une augmentation générale des salaires de 25% et l'engagement de construire le prochain avion commercial du groupe dans la région de Seattle. Il incluait également 12 semaines de congé parental rémunéré, une meilleure sécurité de l'emploi, des prestations de retraite améliorées et d'autres avantages. Cela n'a pas suffi.",
