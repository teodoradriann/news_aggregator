    "text": "Prince William says his mum taught him “everyone has the potential to give something back”.\nThe 41-year-old – whose mother, Princess Diana, died aged 36 in 1997 – gave an emotion-filled speech today, paying tribute to her charity legacy.\nHe told an audience at the Diana Legacy Awards at the Science Museum, London: “This evening’s Legacy Award is particularly special as it marks the 25th anniversary year of The Diana Award, a charity set up to reflect my mother's belief that young people can change the world.\n“I know that she would have been honoured to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe.”\nHe added his mum taught him “everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life”, with the dad-of-three adding: “She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back; that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life.”\nReferring to his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales, 42, who is continuing to recover from abdominal surgery, he added: “That legacy is something that both Catherine and I have sought to focus on through our work, as have the 50,000 young people who have received a Diana Award over the past 25 years.\n“I am so proud to see this belief of my mother’s manifested in the amazing young people receiving the Legacy Award tonight.”\nThe legacy award was introduced by The Diana Award in 2017 to celebrate the life of the tragic princess on the 20th anniversary of her death.\nToday's event included a performance from songwriter Tom Walker and was hosted by Cel Spellman.\nWilliam’s estranged brother Prince Harry, 39, is due to speak via videolink at the event.",

    "text": "“Good to see Ivanishvili finally came out of hiding. His excuses were weak. Challenge accepted! Happy New Year!,” former Prime Minister and the Chairman of the For Georgia party, Giorgi Gakharia responded to news of the Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili’s [return](https://georgiatoday.ge/bidzina-ivanishvili-returns-to-politics/) to politics. Ivanishvili was elected honorary chairman of the “Georgian Dream” Congress. About 350 delegates attended the congress. “The only thing I could not count on was the betrayal of the country and the team by Giorgi Gakharia one month after I distanced myself from politics,” Bidzina Ivanishvili stated, adding he had to take on the function of an advisor after that. “For the first time since 2018, I have had to turn to politics. I recall the words of the former ambassador of the European Union, an ambassador with whom I was friends with, who told me that if I did not return for a month, there would be nothing left of the ruling party. “I knew this very well, but from what the ambassador said, I understood that what I saw and assessed looked good from the outside. Then, I fulfilled my mission. We organized the team, set up the system, and after that I left politics for a second time- I had to retire and I had a good reason for doing so. “The only thing I could not count on was the betrayal of the country and the team by Giorgi Gakharia one month after I distanced myself from politics. Then I had to act as an advisor, and if I didn’t help the team through consultations, the processes would have developed in the most difficult scenario for the country. “Since then, I have regularly communicated with 2-3 leaders of the party, which helped to maintain a healthy situation in the team. A former leader of the party advising the team is a common occurrence, it happened and is happening in many democratic countries”, Ivanishvili noted.",

    "text": "Android Auto è una piattaforma a cui il team di sviluppatori di Google dedica continue attenzioni, rilasciando aggiornamenti con una frequenza costante ma alle volte tali update possono anche generare qualche problema.\nUn esempio in tal senso è quello che ci arriva da diversi utenti, che negli ultimi giorni hanno iniziato a notare un peggioramento dell’esperienza di visualizzazione offerta dall’applicazione del colosso di Mountain View, la cui interfaccia sembra essere divenuta sbiadita.\nRicordiamo che Android Auto è la soluzione studiata da Google per mettere a disposizione degli utenti un valido assistente per i loro spostamenti, il tutto con l’obiettivo primario di consentire al conducente di un veicolo di mantenere la concentrazione ben fissa sulla strada, sfruttando le potenzialità dell’assistente virtuale del colosso di Mountain View per la gestione degli aspetti multimediali e per le comunicazioni con i propri contatti.\nOfferte Bomba! Solo errori di prezzo o sconti incredibili ma verificati!\nScoperto un nuovo problema per Android Auto Si stanno moltiplicando su Reddit le segnalazioni di utenti che hanno iniziato a riscontrare quello che può essere definito un vero e proprio problema per quanto riguarda l’esperienza video offerta da Android Auto, la cui interfaccia pare abbia assunto una tonalità tendente al grigio (dovrebbe trattarsi di un aumento del contrasto).\nI display appaiono così sbiaditi che alcuni utenti hanno pensato che il bug in questione potesse invece essere una modifica intenzionale del design da parte di Google e pare che non sia possibile risolvere il problema modificando le impostazioni dello schermo del veicolo.\nAnche se, stando a quanto suggerito da qualche utente che ha riscontrato il problema, una soluzione fai-da-te ci sarebbe (almeno in alcuni casi), sebbene sia solo temporanea: cancellare i dati e la cache dall’app Android Auto, infatti, tende ad eliminare il bug per un po’ di tempo.\nNella speranza che il team di sviluppatori di Google possa trovare la causa del problema e risolverlo in tempi rapidi. Staremo a vedere.\nPotrebbe interessarti: Android Auto arriva alla versione 15: tutte le novità del nuovo aggiornamento",

    "text": "According to Director of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Mai Van Khiem, the extreme weather events included a low turbulence in the middle of and southern East Sea, intensification of cold air and a powerful operation of monsoon which would cause widespread heavy rains in the Central region. This is a weather pattern causing localized heavy rain, the risk of waterlogging, flash floods and landslides in the North Central and mid-Central regions, primarily in the provinces and cities from Ha Tinh to Da Nang and Quang Nam and Phu Yen provinces. It is anticipated that these regions can experience two or three more spells of heavy rains from November 11. In response to extreme and dangerous weather in both the mainland and sea, the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting requested that local authorities carry out preventive measures against the risk above warned. Particularly, it is necessary to regularly update information on forecasts and warnings of natural disasters issued according to regulations. Besides, localities in the Central region need to instruct troops to review hazardous points and prevent blockage of river flow and streams to ensure people's safety; require owners of hydroelectric and irrigation reservoirs to strictly comply with regulations on providing observation data, operational information and hydrological forecasts to meteorological units.",

    "title": "LZ Granderson: Your US history class needed a film like 'Rustin'",
    "text": "In the '90s I was a founding member of the Black History Club in high school, took Black history courses in college and worked in the minority affairs office in grad school. Yet I did not know who Bayard Rustin was until seeing the 2003 documentary \"Brother Outsider.\"\nThat miseducation was not by accident.\nRustin — the man who introduced the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the principles of nonviolence, the man who organized the March on Washington — was gay. Because of his sexual orientation, his contributions to the civil rights movement were not often retold. Since the documentary's release 20 years ago, there has been a concerted effort to change that, most recently culminating in the 2023 film \"Rustin\" and the performance of awards season darling Colman Domingo in the title role.\nA decade ago, Domingo brought Ralph Abernathy to life in Ava DuVernay's \"Selma,\" which also included Rustin. Today he is the first Afro-Latino to be nominated for a lead actor Oscar. He is the second out gay man to be nominated for portraying an out gay man.\nPeople are also reading…\nThis intersection has quietly played a significant part in Domingo's career: He appeared in 2020's Oscar winner \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" about the life of a queer Black woman, and in 2018's Oscar winner \"If Beale Street Could Talk,\" based on a book by James Baldwin, a gay Black man. For his work last year, in addition to being Oscar-nominated for \"Rustin,\" Domingo is part of the SAG-nominated cast of \"The Color Purple,\" written by out Black author Alice Walker.\nRecently it seems Domingo has been the person to call when Hollywood recognizes that representation matters. Not because it can grab attention and awards, but because representation reflects the history and the connective tissue between the Black and LGBTQ+ communities.\nFor many years, what little queer content there was in mainstream America did not include people of color. But we've long been here, standing at the intersection.\nWalker's \"Purple\" shaped the 1980s. Baldwin's \"Beale Street\" was born in the 1970s. Rustin came to prominence in the 1960s, but his work in civil rights dates back to the 1940s. And Ma Rainey, the Mother of the Blues, was a queer Black woman born in 1886.\nThat was the year of the Carroll County Courthouse Massacre in Mississippi. More than 50 armed white men stormed a courtroom and opened fire on all the Black people in attendance, killing more than 20. The crime? A Black lawyer bringing charges against a white person.\nThat was the world Rainey was born into. And in that world she openly had relationships with women. I marvel thinking about the bravery. Viola Davis was nominated for awards for bringing Rainey's full life to audiences.\nIt's important to tell these stories at the intersection. People need to know this history that's been kept from all of us because of yesteryear's attitudes. It's important that Hollywood develops the same fascination with these hidden figures as it does with the lives of Garland, Monroe, Elvis and other white cultural icons whose biographies have been reexamined time and again.\nNow that queer storytelling has expanded beyond Stonewall and the HIV/AIDS crisis, my hope is that more of the Rustins of history will be explored. The entertainment value is important, the history even more so.\nKeeping warriors such as Rustin out of history and out of storytelling was intentional. The push to correct that wrong should be deliberate as well. It's wonderful that Domingo is everywhere for his portrayal of Rustin. And it would be even more so if Rustin, who was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, were everywhere in Black history lessons.\nHis role in history isn't yet celebrated as it should be. Maybe it never will be. That's what happens when contributions are minimized. Stories become lost. Tremendous acts of courage are forgotten. Too many lives we should honor go unknown.\nThis awards season, a light has been shined on someone we should never forget. Perhaps instead of relying on sequels and reboots, Hollywood should turn to the stories nestled in our history that we should know. The history that prejudice tried to keep in the shadows should take center stage.",

    "text": "Technician at psychiatric hospital accused of raping drugged patient multiple times\nJeff Doresca, 37, allegedly attacked the patient while she was under the influence of her medications\nMichelle Del Rey\nA technician at a Florida psychiatric hospital has been accused of raping a patient multiple times while she was drowsy from her medications.\nBroward Sheriff’s Office deputies in Oakland Park arrested Jeff Doresca, 37, on Monday on half a dozen sexual battery charges.\nThe alleged attacks happened after an unidentified 32-year-old woman admitted herself to the Fort Lauderdale Behavioral Health Center on Thursday for schizophrenia and depression treatment.\nShortly before 4:25pm on Sunday, the woman had been given her regular medications, which caused her to become drowsy and lose consciousness. She later woke up and saw a nurse putting a wet towel on her forehead.\nAfter the nurse left, Doresca entered the room and asked the victim if she had showered. The woman said she hadn’t. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by Local 10 News, Doresca allegedly instructed the woman to take a shower and watched her as she did so.\nPolice said the man then allegedly touched the victim who was still drowsy and didn’t understand what was happening, a deputy wrote in the affidavit.\nA staff member gave the woman additional medication just after 9:30pm which made her more drowsy. Doresca reportedly returned to the room and sexually assaulted her. He would do so five more times while the patient was “too drowsy and weak to resist,” police said.\nThe woman’s roommate reportedly witnessed at least one of the rapes. Surveillance footage also caught the man going into the victim’s room several times. He reportedly looked down the hallway before entering to check if anyone had seen him.\nThe roommate “saw the male tech having sex with (the victim),” the affidavit states. However, since the roommate didn’t notice the woman resisting, she assumed the encounter was consensual.\nDuring a police interview, Doresca admitted to having sexual intercourse with the woman but said the patient “came onto him” and “threatened him that if he did not have sex with (her) that she would report him and he would lose his job,” the affidavit continues.\nThe document further states: “Doresca admitted that he was instructed when he was hired that he was not allowed to have sex with any of the patients (and) that it was wrong to have sex with a mental patient who was drowsy from being under the influence of her medication.”\nDoresca told a deputy “he was not thinking straight when he had sex with a helpless victim.”\nThe tech has been arrested on six first-degree sexual battery charges and is being held in the county's main jail. If he posts bond, he’s been instructed not to contact the victim or work as a caregiver.\nDoresca has been living in the US for two years on Temporary Protected Status.",

    "text": "Jesus told us the poor will always be among us and truly even in the most affluent of societies there are those who fall through the cracks and whose lives are short, harsh and brutal. We are particularly mindful of their plight at Christmas. But this year we seem to have even more desperate and struggling citizens, judging by the thousands standing long hours in the midday sun hoping to receive food packages from their elected representatives whom one would expect would be better engaged in Parliament passing legislation to make life more bearable for the masses. What was particularly noticeable this Christmas was that the majority of those in need of food assistance seemed to be in the North Rift, the bread basket of Kenya, at a time when we are informed that there is a bumper harvest and Uasin Gishu received 25 per cent of the subsidised fertiliser. There is something very shameful that 60 years after independence thousands and thousands are reduced to begging from the country’s elected representatives to put food on their tables for their families at Christmas. It is a societal failure. Yet, when the celebrations wind down, the reality of an economy in crisis and a sprouting authoritarian leadership will dawn on everyone. The increasing expense of education will be a headache for every parent, but the looming crisis in health will bring even more challenges. Universal Health Care remains a slogan rather than a reality as NHIF transforms into SHIF, with no tangible evidence to suggest that it has the capacity or intention to pay its billions of debts to the private hospitals, a large section of whom have now withdrawn their services to NHIF patients. This transition must not become an excuse to escape from responsibility as health providers will certainly not cooperate with the new scheme until such time as their old bills are paid. More likely still is that citizens will resist the 2.75 per cent monthly salary deductions for services that are not in place, confirmed by the Ministry of Health and UNICEF research that revealed that only 7 per cent of the nation’s hospitals have the facilities and capacity required to implement the new SHIF legislation. As stated frequently, despite the promises and PR, the Kenya Kwanza government must acknowledge that the vast majority of the public have lost trust in their leadership. Citizens no longer believe what they are told because they have not seen any improvement in their lives since they came to office. The predominant view is that they will bulldoze their way forward, tax you to the hilt but won’t listen to your cries of despair. Moreover, day by day, the same regime is eroding the powers of the independent commissions that were established to represent the citizens interests. The latest assault is on the National Land Commission that was established to protect public land because successive governments had looted and dished it out to their cronies. Now, the Ministry of Lands wants to restore to itself the powers of public acquisition and compensation, reducing the NLC to a mere feeble department. There is a similar onslaught on the Anti-Corruption Commission as the Secretary to the Cabinet recently convened a meeting to announce that the government is setting up an almost parallel structure to fight corruption. Few believe that these moves are in the public interest, nor the scheme to disband the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. Put another way, we are seeing a deliberately planned emasculation of the Constitution at every level resulting in a growing authoritarianism, coupled with threats to use the sword against anyone that stands in their way. Unfortunately, the opposition is so compromised and divided that it offers no real vision or alternative. The new year looks bleak, yet this is a wake-up call to the many stakeholders, patriots and leaders of ability and integrity who may be sitting on the fence and hoping for a miracle. Jesus is not coming back any day soon and the work of Christmas to build a just and equitable society begins on January 1. We are pretty much on our own, so get up, speak up and get down off the fence.",
