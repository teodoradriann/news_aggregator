    "text": "About thirty kilometers from the Lebanese border, the Israeli town is preparing for a revenge attack by Hezbollah. Even those who do not support the actions of the Israeli government have to prepare.\nHaifa\nRead the summary\nThe summary is made by artificial intelligence and checked by a human.\nIsrael is preparing for Hezbollah’s possible revenge.\nIn Haifa, Rambam Hospital has an underground hospital where 800 patients are evacuated.\nA man from Haifa criticizes the actions of the Israeli government. They do not improve the living conditions of ordinary people.\nMeeting has agreed to a hospital. We’re almost an hour late because the map apps aren’t working.\nPatiently waiting for us David Ratner a spokesman for Haifa’s Rambam Hospital, says the reason: the Israeli armed forces have jammed GPS connections to make it harder for Hezbollah rockets to find their destination.\nThis is one of the many ways in which Israel prepares for an attack that may soon arrive from Lebanon.\nSuch has been the case since Israel killed two important Hamas and Hezbollah leaders at the end of July. Iran and its affiliated Hezbollah organization operating from Lebanon have vowed to avenge the deaths.\nAir conditioning was one of the first things built into the underground hospital. Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nRambam is a true hymn to preparedness.\nAn underground hospital has been built in its parking garage, where 800 patients and hospital staff would be evacuated in the event of a retaliatory strike.\nRatner talks non-stop as we walk past parking spaces filled with hospital beds. He exudes pride in the way everything has been thought out in “the world’s largest underground hospital.”\nMany things have to be taken into account. Not only the organization of medical care, but even sewage. Staff, patients and relatives must be accommodated.\n“There will be about 5,000 people here, all of whom need to poop and pee. It would be very smelly in here, it wouldn’t be comfortable, it would be like hell, but we would be protected,” explains Ratner.\nThe Rambam’s contingency plan was created years before the latest escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. During the Lebanon war in 2006, patients were treated in the hospital amidst air raids.\nAfter those experiences, it was decided in Israel that the next war would be better prepared.\nIn the underground hospital, you can wash in the field shower built on top of the parking spaces intended for the disabled Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nThe equipment needed in the hospital has been collected in the parking garage of Rambam Hospital, so that everything would be ready when a possible attack begins. Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nPreparation war can be seen everywhere in Israel.\nAbout 60,000 civilians have been evacuated from the northern parts of the country, near the Lebanese border. There are signs in public places that advise the route to the nearest bomb shelter. The blow is expected to come at any moment.\nIn Gaza, the situation is almost the opposite.\nBig strikes are no longer expected, but Israel has been carrying them out for ten months already. People have little chance to protect themselves. Hamas has built a network of tunnels under Gaza for its own fighters.\nIsrael has repeatedly struck targets located in places designated as humanitarian safe zones. More than 40,000 people have died.\nReporters have not been able to enter Gaza since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out last October.\nGaza is also linked to the threat of Hezbollah and Iran, which Israel is currently preparing for. Reuters according to Iranian sources a ceasefire could rein in Iran and Hezbollah.\nFrom Haifa Jonah Clarfield says that the situation in Gaza cannot continue like this.\nJonah Clarfield has just moved into his home, but he may have to leave if the expected backlash comes. Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nof Clarfield it echoes a little in the apartment, because the decoration of the new home is in progress. Clarfield, who grew up in Jerusalem, moved to Haifa only a few weeks ago. The function of the sofa is also provided by the mattress.\nEven though a retaliatory strike could mean an early departure for Clarfield, he doesn’t feel intimidated.\nHe says he’s more of a turd.\nClarfield is very disappointed with the Israeli government. He believes that the situation could have been prevented from escalating to this point and that the deaths of individual Hamas leaders will not lead to a safer environment on a large scale.\n“I don’t feel that the Israeli government has a useful strategy that strengthens the living conditions of the people living here,” says Clarfield.\nClarfield also had to prepare for a possible revenge attack.\n“I’m not naive. — I know where my shelter is and I have a bag packed and an alternative place I can go to within the country,” says Clarfield.\nBut when we ask for a picture of the bag’s contents, Clarfield politely declines. He doesn’t want to appear as a victim when at the same time so many people suffer more than him.\nJonah Clarfield’s balcony offers a view of Haifa harbor. Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nIts instead, Clarfield wants to talk about what kind of change he would like to see in Israel.\n“The release of the hostages, the end of the war and the end of the Israeli occupation are all intertwined,” he says.\nAccording to Clarfield, the occupation of Palestine must therefore end. According to him, some kind of agreement must be reached that is fair to the Palestinians.\n“Otherwise, this cycle of oppression, violence and terror will continue indefinitely. It seems like this is a minority opinion in today’s Israel,” says Clarfield.\nClarfield speaks choosing his words carefully, avoiding filler words. Talking about these opinions has led to trouble in the past.\nThe funicular station next to Clarfield is not big, but it could act as a bomb shelter if necessary. Picture: Sami Kero / HS\nTogether in this matter, Clarfield is on the same lines as his compatriots. The hostages kidnapped by Hamas in October must be brought home.\nPictures of the abductees are everywhere you go in Israel. “Bring them home,” reads ATMs and the sides of cars.\nThe fate of the hostages is also on the table in the cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nAs a result of talks in Qatar last week, the US presented a preliminary ceasefire proposal aimed at bringing Hamas and Israel closer together.\nStill, the US newspaper The New York Times write based on his sources, that there are still major, unresolved disputes.\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said believing that it might be the “best and last” chance to free the abductees.\nThere are currently believed to be 109 of them in Gaza. It is not known how many are still alive. According to Hamas, some of the prisoners were killed in Israel’s own attacks.\nFor time, when negotiations are held, civilians can only wait. At the Rambam hospital, David Ratner says that the prolonged tense situation has taken its toll.\nThe number of people seeking treatment for anxiety and depression has increased by one hundred percent in a year, he says.\nRegardless, Ratner doesn’t think the retaliation is “anything really bad.”\n“Remember Sting? He has a song that says, ‘I hope the Russians love children too’. I think the same or… I hope that Hezbollah and Iran also love children.”\nAccording to David Ratner, it is important that each hospital department knows its turn to go downstairs in an evacuation situation. Otherwise there would be chaos. If the attack came from Iran, it could take a few hours to move, while Hezbollah’s rockets could be there in a minute at worst.

I don't know, but sometimes it's okay. And then also you start getting a whiff, and you're like, 'Where is this coming from?'\"\nThe borough says they are actively working to fix the stinky smell.\nThey say the wastewater plant located on the South Reading Road is to blame.\nIt's a plant that takes sewage and removes contaminants, making the waste safer for the environment.\nBut parts of the system were not functioning properly. The borough says they discovered this after an investigation last week, adding that is likely what's causing the rancid odor.\nThat system has been fixed, but it could take weeks for the smell to improve.\nThe facility was upgraded recently. And with the new technology, there can come some issues.\nEphrata Borough manager Nancy Harris says, \"It's the second plant in the U.S. That's processing human waste that way. And the first one on the East Coast. So we have some growing pains. And unfortunately, it's impacting the residents in the area.\"\nThe borough says they are continuing to investigate what is happening at the treatment plant and want residents to know they are taking their concerns seriously.",

    "title": "Saskatoon Pride bans Sask. Party members from participating | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Saskatoon Pride says 'no' to Sask. Party members who said 'yea' to pronoun law Saskatoon Pride has joined the chorus of organizations banning members of the Sask. Party from Pride events this month over its controversial law that would effectively “out” children who want to go by a different name or pronouns in school. “The Sask. Party and its members who stood up and answered ‘Yea’ to Bill 137 are banned from our 2024 Pride Parade and other festival activities and events,” Saskatoon Pride said in a statement on Wednesday. “They are not allies to two spirit, trans, or other queer people in this province.” Pride organizations in Prince Albert, North Battleford, and Regina [made similar announcements last month](https://regina.ctvnews.ca/saskatchewan-party-mlas-barred-from-regina-pride-parade-over-school-pronoun-law-1.6884951), all related to Bill 137 — dubbed the Parents Bill of Rights. The law requires parental consent for students under the age of 16 to change their names or pronouns while at school. Initially introduced as a Ministry of Education policy in August 2023, the pronoun rules drew immediate pushback from the University of Regina's Pride organization, UR Pride, which launched a legal challenge alongside Egale Canada claiming the policy violated the Charter rights of children. To prevent the pronoun rules from being struck down, the Sask. Party enshrined the policy into law in October, invoking the notwithstanding clause to shield it from a potential court order. In February, a King's Bench judge said Egale’s Charter case could proceed anyway. Even if the court could not strike down the law because of the notwithstanding clause, a judge could still hear the case and decide if the law violated the Charter rights of children. The provincial government turned to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to intervene. It’s arguing that the use of the notwithstanding clause should [prevent a judge from even hearing the case](https://regina.ctvnews.ca/alberta-intends-to-intervene-in-parents-bill-of-rights-case-before-sask-court-of-appeal-1.6840523). The bill also implements sweeping restrictions of [sexual health education](https://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/sexual-assault-centres-barred-from-classrooms-under-new-sask-pronoun-rules-1.6605734), including barring third-party health organizations and sexual assault centres from presenting in schools. “The ongoing anxiety the Sask. Party government created when they invoked the notwithstanding clause to avoid the scrutiny and power of the courts thereby limiting the rights of queer and trans young people is both telling and alarming,” Saskatoon Pride’s board said in its statement. “It shows how far sitting Sask. Party members of the day, and particularly the premier, and the justice and education ministers, will go to appease the extreme right of the province.” Saskatoon Pride says the law turns back the clock on years of progress made by the community. “Given their attack on rights of queer and trans youth there was no way in which our board would approve their participation in our festival.” In a statement to CTV News on Thursday, a spokesperson for the executive council said it’s up to the organizers to choose who can attend their events. “With respect to pride parades, the organizers determine attendance for their events and we will respect their decision.” The province did still proclaim June 2024 as Pride Month, the spokesperson said.

    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Renowned entrepreneur and technology analyst James Altucher is predicting what could be the most significant technological shift of the decade. According to Altucher, all signs point to Elon Musk preparing to unveil a groundbreaking development as early as March 13, 2025 —announcing an event he calls a “Super-IPO” that could redefine global connectivity forever.\nThe Starlink Revolution\nStarlink, a division of SpaceX, has already disrupted traditional internet service providers by deploying a revolutionary satellite-based network. Unlike conventional broadband and 5G technology, Starlink’s system bypasses ground-based infrastructure, delivering fast, reliable, and uninterrupted internet access from anywhere on the planet—whether in a metropolitan hub or a remote rural location.\nAltucher explains that this technology is set to challenge legacy telecom giants, with Musk’s vision for a global, high-speed internet service that eliminates dead zones, enhances emergency response systems, and powers the next generation of digital communication. With over 2.6 million users already onboard and expansion accelerating, Starlink is at the forefront of a connectivity revolution.\nKey Developments Leading to a Major Announcement\nA series of key developments have fueled speculation about an imminent announcement:\n● Elon Musk’s Own Statements: In a previous statement, Musk confirmed that Starlink would go public once its cash flow became predictable—recent reports indicate this milestone has been reached.\n● Market Positioning: Analysts note that Starlink has surpassed critical operational thresholds, now servicing major commercial and government clients worldwide.\n● Government & Industry Integration: With ties to aerospace, defense, and global commerce, Starlink’s expanding role suggests a strategic alignment with the next phase of space-based communications.\nAltucher’s Perspective on This Historic Moment\nJames Altucher states, “Mark my words: what’s coming next is a radical new internet, powered directly by President Trump’s right-hand man, Elon Musk”\nFurther emphasizing the impact of this anticipated announcement, Altucher remarks, “History shows that situations like this are when everyday folks have the rare shot at getting extraordinarily rich”\nHe draws comparisons to past technological revolutions, adding, “Untold amounts of wealth are made over time by folks who see it coming”\nWhat Comes Next?\nWith March 13 on the horizon, all eyes are on Musk and his team as they prepare to potentially unveil what could be the largest technological leap forward in modern internet history.\nAbout James Altucher\nJames Altucher is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, and technology analyst known for his deep insights into emerging trends and disruptive innovations. He has founded multiple companies, appeared on top financial media platforms, and built a loyal following through his expertise in finance, tech, and entrepreneurship.

[…] I'd probably today be diagnosed as ADHD, I was bouncing off the walls. I couldn't sit still, I just wanted to get in the woods. […] I started doing heroin, I went to the top of my class.
