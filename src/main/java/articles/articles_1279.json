    "title": "Clarence Thomas took more undisclosed trips paid for by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, Senate committee chair says",
    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas omitted at least three trips gifted by Republican megadonor Harlan Crow from his financial disclosures, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said. Durbin’s office obtained the information through a subpoena for Crow that the Judiciary panel authorized as part of an ethics probe of the court. Thomas recently amended a prior financial disclosure to include trips to Indonesia, and California that he had accepted from Crow and without disclosing at the time. Crow’s office said it struck a deal to give the committee seven years of information — in exchange for the panel dropping its investigation into the real estate magnate. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has omitted at least three private jet trips gifted by Republican megadonor Harlan Crow from his annual financial disclosures , a top Senate Democrat alleged Thursday.\nThose trips included private flights in 2017, 2019 and 2021 that Thomas failed to disclose, according to Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin of Illinois.\nDurbin’s office said it obtained documents revealing the trips as a result of the Judiciary panel authorizing a subpoena for Crow in November as part of an ethics probe of the Supreme Court.\nCrow’s office told CNBC that it struck an agreement to provide the committee with relevant information stretching back seven years — in exchange for the panel dropping its investigation into the real estate magnate.\n“Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning to resolve the matter,” his office said in a statement.\nThe documents revealed a private flight in May 5, 2017, taking Thomas from St. Louis, Missouri, to Kalispell, Montana, and a return flight to Dallas, Texas, on May 9, the senator’s office said in a press release.\nCrow’s documents also showed round-trip flights from Washington, D.C., to Savannah, Georgia, on March 23, 2019, and to and from D.C. to San Jose, California, on June 29, 2021, Durbin’s office said.\nThe Senate probe of the Supreme Court “makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,” Durbin said in a statement.\nSpokespeople for Thomas and the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for comment.\nThe Judiciary chairman released the information less than a week after Thomas amended his 2019 financial disclosure report to include trips to Bali, Indonesia, and Monte Rio, California, that he had accepted from Crow that year.\nThomas said in his latest disclosure that those two trips were “inadvertently omitted” at the time.\nProPublica first revealed them last year, reporting in a bombshell investigation that the Bali trip could have exceeded $500,000 if the conservative justice paid for it himself. Thomas’ amendment in last week’s disclosure does not say how much the trips were worth.\nThomas’ attorney Elliot Berke said in August 2023 that the justice had correctly followed judicial guidance that at the time did not require him to disclose transportation.\nThe new information from Durbin also follows a recent analysis from judicial reform group Fix the Court, which found that Thomas has accepted millions of dollars’ worth of gifts during his more than three-decade tenure on the nation’s highest court.\nThat figure dwarfs the combined value of all the gifts received by the eight other current justices, Fix the Court’s analysis showed.\nArgentina’s Senate passes Milei’s economic reform bill as protesters clash with riot police Judge bars ‘pharma bro’ Martin Shkreli from streaming Wu-Tang Clan album after suit says he copied it Biden cheers cooling inflation ahead of key Fed interest rate decision Trump and Biden campaigns go head-to-head with rival fundraisers in London The court in November announced a code of conduct aimed to tamp down any “misunderstanding” that its nine life-appointed members see themselves as unbeholden to ethical rules.\nBut the document, which has no apparent enforcement measures, has hardly quieted the court’s chorus of mostly Democratic critics. Their gripes have only grown as the court, which bears a 6-3 conservative majority, gears up to deliver key rulings related to former President Donald Trump .\nDurbin said Thursday that as long as Chief Justice John Roberts refuses to adopt an enforceable code of conduct, the committee will continue to push for legislation that would saddle the court with new ethical and financial rules.",

    "text": "Article: Sluggish Tempo of Supreme Courtroom’s Selections Raises Considerations\nSluggish Tempo of Supreme Courtroom’s Selections Raises Considerations Delay in Considerably Anticipated Rulings Leaves Dangerous Information for the Nation Authorized analyst Elie Mystal warns of “unhealthy” information forward because the Supreme Courtroom launched three rulings this week, none of which included the key circumstances eagerly awaited this time period. With 28 selections nonetheless pending, together with a number of main ones, issues come up because the courtroom is predicted to cram all of the rulings, together with vital ones on abortion capsule mifepristone and former President Donald Trump’s presidential immunity, into the final three weeks of the time period. The sluggish tempo of the Courtroom’s selections raises questions concerning the potential penalties and goal behind the delay.\nSignificance of Additional Delay in Ruling on Trump’s Immunity One of many alarming elements of the restricted selections made on Thursday is the delay in ruling on the potential for former President Donald Trump being criminally prosecuted. Analyst Elie Mystal means that this delay might point out that Justice Samuel Alito, amongst others, could be planning to take excessive actions within the case. Mystal expresses issues that the courtroom’s conservative majority could also be contemplating granting “absolute” immunity or one thing near it to Trump, relatively than ruling towards his immunity claims.\nImpression on Federal Election and Categorised Paperwork Instances The Supreme Courtroom’s ruling within the case of Trump v. United States , which addresses the problem of presidential immunity, has direct implications for the federal election interference case towards Trump. This ruling may additionally affect the federal categorised paperwork case he faces in Florida. Whereas Trump’s Georgia election interference case has already been halted and is unlikely to renew till after the 2024 election, its standing is left unsure because of the sluggish tempo of Supreme Courtroom rulings.\nConservative Supermajority and Prolonged Determination Course of Consultants counsel that the slower publication of opinions in important circumstances is a typical incidence because of the better deliberation and the presence of a number of draft opinions among the many justices. This phenomenon is especially evident with the present conservative supermajority. The justices normally take time to finalize the publication of opinions, with a number of concurring opinions ensuing from their disagreements over the authorized rationale. The courtroom’s workload, additional difficult by elevated safety protocols, has contributed to the delayed launch of selections.\nGuaranteeing Honest Public Notion and Predicting the Courtroom’s Selections Experiences reinforce the concept the sluggish development of vital selections doesn’t essentially point out a predetermined final result. Authorized skilled Mark Joseph Stern emphasizes that the sluggish tempo displays the courtroom’s dealing with of an extreme variety of difficult circumstances and the implementation of additional safety measures. Assistant professor Alex Badas states that based mostly on the oral arguments within the Trump immunity case, the courtroom is unlikely to grant the previous president absolute immunity. Subsequently, the time elapsed between oral arguments and the publication of the opinion shouldn’t be construed as signaling a positive final result for Trump or an endorsement of absolute immunity claims.\nUnusual Information Newsweek is dedicated to difficult standard knowledge and discovering connections within the seek for frequent floor.",

    "text": "En 1961, l’Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) cherche à contraindre la province sécessionniste du Katanga à revenir dans le giron du Congo indépendant. Officiellement, Paris soutient l’intégrité territoriale de l’ancienne colonie belge. Mais, en sous-main, les réseaux de la « Françafrique », qui lorgnent les richesses minières de la province, appuient ces séparatistes farouchement anticommunistes, avec l’aide des régimes racistes de Rhodésie et d’Afrique du Sud. Des centaines de mercenaires français — souvent proches de l’Organisation armée secrète (OAS) — se mettent au service du redoutable ministre de l’intérieur katangais, Godefroid Munongo. Le journaliste Maurin Picard a rencontré de nombreux témoins afin de retracer cette page particulièrement sombre. Non seulement ces mercenaires ont livré de féroces combats aux casques bleus (pour la plupart indiens, éthiopiens, suédois et irlandais), mais leur action clandestine a probablement coûté la vie au secrétaire général de l’ONU, Dag Hammarskjöld, mort dans un mystérieux crash d’avion au-dessus de la Rhodésie du Nord (actuelle Zambie) en septembre 1961.",
