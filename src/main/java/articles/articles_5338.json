    "text": "Australian opener Usman Khawaja has emphasized the need for cricket’s governing bodies to ensure that players receive adequate financial rewards to preserve the Test format. Khawaja underscored the importance of money reaching players’ pockets, warning that without appropriate compensation, players might opt for the lucrative T20 leagues to secure their families’ well-being. Advocating for increased transparency, Khawaja highlighted the allure of central contracts for top Australian players participating in Test cricket due to high match fees. However, he noted that this incentive might not be as prevalent in other nations, leading players to favour playing in T20 leagues where financial rewards are more substantial.

Acknowledging the financial disparities among nations, Khawaja suggested that the challenge lies in providing adequate incentives for players from other countries to prioritize international and Test cricket. He urged cricket boards worldwide to be transparent in determining the best compensation structures for players. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh had previously advocated for a universal match fee for all Test players to address earnings disparities. Khawaja echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the necessity for a collective effort to incentivize players globally and maintain the significance of Test cricket in the cricketing landscape.",

    "text": "TROUT RUN, Pa. — Children and their parents sing songs around a fire at [Camp Susque](https://susque.org/) in Lewis Township outside of Trout Run at the camp's Rain or Shine program. The program started this past fall and is currently in week two of the six-week spring session. \"It's a group of parents and kids who wanna get outside and explore God's creation together; we often are getting our hands dirty, and it's hands-on,\" said Stephanie Knauss, Coordinator of the School of Discovery at Camp Susque. The Rain or Shine program is for ages from two to eight. Activities during the program include campfire songs, exploring, and reading books based on the theme of the day. Stephanie Knauss, School of Discovery Coordinator at Camp Susque, says she started the program, so families with young school-aged children can explore the outdoors together. \"Camp Susque has beautiful grounds, a lot to offer, a variety of woodland, pond, fields, and so we have so much to work with here, and it's a great community,\" said Knauss. In addition to the Thursday rain or Shine event, the camp has an afternoon activity program for children of all ages. \"We use our climbing wall, our ropes course, kayaking, canoeing, archery, any outdoor activity you can think of, we have classes associated with it, a lot of art classes with our pottery studio, we have an observatory—so we do astronomy,\" said Peter Swift, Executive Director Camp Susque. All programs at the camp are possible through donations. Knauss tells Newswatch 16 that having a program like Rain or Shine gives children the opportunity to learn and grow. \"There's so many studies on sensory exploration and children taking initiative, taking risks, enjoying themselves outside, it's just all around healthy for them.\" The Rain or Shine program costs $45 for the six-week spring session. It meets every Thursday at 9:30 a.m. and runs until April.",

    "title": "The Government’s Impartial Trans Healthcare Reviewer Isn’t so Impartial, Colleagues Claim",
    "text": "The Government’s Impartial Trans Healthcare Reviewer Isn’t so Impartial, Colleagues Claim Oops. by Rivkah Brown 8 August 2024 The government’s landmark report on transgender healthcare has sustained another body blow, this time from two doctors one of whom previously worked with its author. The doctors – one a consultant paediatrician, the other a clinical psychologist – claim that Dr Hilary Cass did not approach her review of gender-related healthcare for children and adolescents with an open mind as she has previously claimed – in fact, they say, “ Cass was “known by colleagues to oppose medical transition when she was appointed to the review”. The article throws further doubt onto the impartiality of the government-appointed “independent” reviewer, whose lengthy findings and recommendations have formed the basis of both the Conservatives and the Labour party’s approach to the issue of transgender healthcare for children – though the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) insisted her report was “robust” and “firmly grounded in evidence”. Drs Max Davie and Lorna Hobbs published their 7,000-word analysis of the Cass Report on Davie’s blog on Wednesday. They also made an unpaywalled version of the blog post available via Google Docs . In the article, Davie and Hobbs write that Cass “expressed her dismay and shock at the practice of medical transition to one of us” before she began her review. Neither Davie nor Hobbs worked on the Cass Review, nor do the authors state explicitly when, where or to whom Cass made her remarks – however, Cass and Davie appear to have worked alongside one another as consultant paediatricians at Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS trust. Davie and Hobbs both previously worked at the new child and adolescent gender services at Great Ormond Street Hospital, which made headlines in January after four of its newly-appointed team quit following disagreements over how gender dysphoric children should be treated. It is unclear whether Davie or Hobbs were among them. In their article, Davie and Hobbs wrote that Cass “recommended strongly that we read the gender critical polemic “Irreversible Damage” on the subject”. Subtitled “The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters”, Irreversible Damage was published in 2020 by Regnery Publishing, which describes itself as “America’s leading publisher of conservative books”. Authored by former Wall Street Journal columnist Abigail Shrier, the book was criticised by several clinical professionals for misinterpreting data and ignoring evidence that doesn’t support its conclusions. It went on to win both The Economist and Times book of the year. Cass’s report generated similar controversy when it was finally published in April this year, following a four-year review process. The 388-page report made 32 recommendations, including a more cautious approach to prescribing medical intervention, a “follow-through service” for 17-24-year-olds and a separate service for detransitioners. Among the criticisms of the report were that it exaggerated figures, discarded 98% of the clinical research into puberty blockers and hormone treatment, and made conclusions unsupported by its own analysis. Commentators also noted that transgender people were expressly excluded from the review’s governance committee. In early July, nine American and Australian academics including from the Yale School of Medicine and Yale Law School co-authored a white paper on the Cass Review, finding that it “repeatedly misuses data and violates its own evidentiary standards by resting many conclusions on speculations”. They added that the review “levies unsupported assertions about gender identity, gender dysphoria, standard practices, and the safety of gender-affirming medical treatments, and repeats claims that have been disproved by sound evidence.” In response to the controversy, Cass – who was given a peerage by Rishi Sunak earlier this year – gave several interviews to media outlets, insisting on her impartiality. In one interview with the New Statesman stated: “When she was handed this unenviable task, Cass had no pre-conceived ideas. One of her friends was trans, but otherwise she was coming at it “pretty cold””. This, write Davie and Hobbs, is a “hilarious claim”. Despite being widely criticised within the healthcare profession, the Cass Review – commissioned by the Conservative government in 2020 – has formed the basis of Labour’s approach to transgender healthcare. One of Wes Streeting’s first acts as health secretary was to unilaterally ban puberty blockers for transgender children, a decision recently upheld by the High Court. Streeting previously described the Cass Review as “a watershed moment for the NHS’s gender identity services”, describing Cass’s work as “thoughtful and thorough”. In a statement to Novara Media, DHSC defended Cass’s report, and said that her recommendations would be rolled out. A departmental spokesperson said: “The Cass Review is a robust report backed by clinicians and firmly grounded in evidence. NHS England will be implementing Dr Cass’s recommendations so that children and young people get the safe, holistic care and support they need. “Yesterday NHSE announced the rolling out of new gender services as recommended by Dr Cass, and the setting up a clinical trial to establish the evidence on puberty blockers, because children’s healthcare should always be led by evidence.” The NHS Cass Review team did not respond to Novara Media’s request for comment.

    "text": "A promise made. A promise broken. During the 2019 election campaign, the Liberals committed to introducing legislation to combat online hate, a promise they did not fulfill during that term. They repeated this commitment in the 2021 campaign, going as far as pledging to introduce online harms legislation within the first 100 days of their third mandate. That deadline also came and went, along with several others, and we have yet to see any legislation tabled regarding online hate. At the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs’ Antisemitism: Face It, Fight It conference on Oct. 17, 2023, Justice Minister Arif Virani recommitted his government to introducing legislation to combat online hate. We are still waiting. The problem is that hate does not wait, and Canadians are suffering because of the government’s failure to live up to that promise. Antisemitism is not new; in fact, it is often referred to as the ‘world’s oldest hatred.’ And Canada is not immune. Year after year, Statistics Canada data confirm that Jews are the religious minority most targeted by hate crimes; but the explosion of Jew-hatred we have seen since Hamas’ vicious attack against Israeli citizens on Oct. 7, 2023, is nothing less than terrifying. One of the main environments in which Jew-hatred flourishes, nearly unencumbered, is online. The virtual world is a playground for bad actors spreading disinformation and propaganda, and for those eager to radicalize others through hate. Many online users have insufficient digital literacy skills which renders them easy prey for individuals, groups, or state actors who, shielded by the anonymity of the internet, deliberately spread false or manipulated information. Over the past three months, the level of antisemitic toxicity online has reached a fever pitch. But why, “if sticks and stones might break my bones, but names will never hurt me,” is it so very scary? Because we know that what happens online does not stay online. Jewish schools have been shot at ,and bomb threats have been made against others. Synagogues have been fire-bombed, and community institutions pelleted by Molotov cocktails. Jewish students have been insulted and assaulted on campus, and Jewish-owned businesses set on fire, vandalized, and picketed. In the wake of Oct. 7, we see Canadians divided by an us-versus-them mentality exacerbated by false narratives and lies. Conspiracy theories and tropes are running rampant, unchecked. Religious and ethnic community institutions dragged into a conflict a world away need added security to protect their constituency here. But it didn’t have to be this way. Though I am not naïve enough to think that Jew hatred would have been eradicated had the government lived up to their promise to protect Canadians from online hate, this divisiveness would certainly have been reduced. When it comes to hate, less is better. The federal government has a central role to play in combating online antisemitism; and, for the soul of our country, legislation can be delayed no longer. The anti-online hate legislation should establish an independent regulator to ensure impartial decisions about what constitutes online hate. To identify hate, it must be defined. Although freedom of expression is a foundational right in our democracy, there is no right not to be offended. The bar must be set so that freedom of expression is protected while real hate is caught. That is why the definition of hate must be aligned with the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. Also, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of antisemitism—adopted in 2019 as part of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy—should be used as a non-legally binding guide to what constitutes antisemitism. Social media companies have often been more a part of the problem than the solution. They should be compelled to address online hate with penalties imposed for non-compliance. They should also be required to increase transparency regarding their algorithms and their internal policies, procedures, and guidelines. Finally, Ottawa must launch a national social media literacy campaign to sensitize everyone—especially younger, more vulnerable Canadians—about the appropriate use and abuse of social media. Designed with input from those most affected by online hate, including the Jewish community, this campaign should include up-to-date information on combating online disinformation and hate. The federal government should also engage with provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, and with school boards to encourage broad buy-in and adoption. The rise in antisemitism is dramatic in Canada. Part of the solution lies in diminishing the level of Jew-hatred online. The Liberals have promised to tackle online hate. It is past time for them to fulfill their promise.
