    "title": "Un couple sauvé un extremis pendant les crues en Isère : le récit du secouriste",
    "text": "Le hameau de la Bérarde (Isère) a été dévasté par un torrent qui s’est formé en quelques minutes.Certains rescapés se sont vus mourir, notamment un couple pris au piège dans une maison quasiment ensevelie.L’absence de victime tient du miracle. C’était vendredi vers 9h. À ce moment-là, la chapelle de la Bérarde tient encore debout. Une grosse opération de sauvetage a commencé pour évacuer une centaine de personnes prises au piège, mais deux manquent à l’appel, un couple de Belges coincés dans la mezzanine d’une maison, que le torrent peut emporter à tout moment. \"On est restés blottis l'un contre l'autre parce qu'on grelottait de froid. On ne parlait plus et on attendait\", explique Didier Frans. \"Une force de la nature extraordinaire\" C’est le brigadier-chef Damien Fillon qui descend alors sur le toit, éventré. \"Quand je mets la tête à travers le toit, je vois l’eau de la rivière qui débaroule dans la maison, qui siphonne et il fait tout noir, et j’entends les cailloux qui entrechoquent la maison, je la sens vibrer. Elle est sur le point de partir, et là, je vois des têtes accrochées aux poutres du plafond qui me disent 'on est là, c’est nous'\", explique-t-il. Rassuré d'avoir \"des gens vivants\", il se demande cependant comment il va pouvoir les sortir d'ici. Une fois sur les lieux, il a tapé sur le toit avec \"une violence\", c'\"une force de la nature extraordinaire\", commente Didier Frans. \"Quand je l'ai vu, c'était le soulagement total\", raconte Marie Frans. Une fois arnachés, les victimes se sont tour à tour \"plus ou moins jetées dans le vide\" et ont pu être \"tirées avec un système de sangles\", détaille Damien Fillon. Les équipages de la Sécurité civile ont maintenu en stationnaire l’hélicoptère pendant toute la durée du sauvetage, et envoyé du premier coup le crochet de treuillage. Et c’est, sans aucun doute, cette rapidité d'exécution qui a permis de sauver le couple et leur sauveteur.",

Are we dealing with an unusual heat event, or is this indicative of a larger, more concerning trend?\nDr. Sharma (DS): It’s a pleasure to be here. The current heatwave in South Central Maharashtra,impacting districts like Solapur,Kolhapur,Sangli,and Satara,is indeed concerning. While individual heatwaves can be attributed to specific meteorological conditions, the intensity and early onset of this heat raise valid concerns.We are observing a trend of increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves globally, driven significantly by climate change. the warming planet means higher baseline temperatures, leading to more extreme heat events. this isn’t just an unusual event; it’s a symptom of a larger climate crisis.\nSE: the article mentions notable temperature spikes, particularly in Solapur, where maximum temperatures reached 39.4 degrees Celsius in early March. How unusual are these temperatures for this time of year and what are the potential causes?\nDS: The early arrival of such intense heat is highly unusual for the region. While March can be warm, temperatures exceeding 39°C are exceptionally high for the early part of the season. There are several factors that can contribute to this alarming scenario:\nClimate Change: The clearest culprit is the ongoing increase in global average temperatures, leading to more extreme weather events. El Niño/La Niña: These cyclical weather patterns can influence regional temperature and rainfall patterns, potentially contributing to heatwaves. Urban Heat Island Effect: Rapid urbanization in these regions can exacerbate heat stress, making urban areas significantly warmer than their surrounding rural landscapes. Land-use changes: Deforestation and changes in land cover can impact local temperatures, heat retention, and wind patterns. SE: The article highlights the impact on residents, with altered work schedules and changes in daily routines. What are the immediate and long-term health risks associated with this extreme heat?\nDS: The immediate health risks are severe. Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can cause heat exhaustion, heatstroke, dehydration, and cardiovascular issues. The elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Long-term exposure to high temperatures is linked to increased mortality rates and a rise in chronic health problems. We must remember that heat is a silent killer; its effects can be insidious and cumulative.\nSE: What practical steps can individuals, communities, and local governments take to mitigate the impacts of these heatwaves?\nDS: There are several measures at different levels:\nFor Individuals:\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, irrespective of thirst. Limit Outdoor Activity: Avoid exercising or spending prolonged time outdoors during peak heat hours. Wear Light Clothing: Opt for light-colored,loose-fitting clothing. Seek Shade: Utilize shade from trees and buildings. Monitor Health: Pay attention to warning signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. for Communities:\nPublic Cooling Centers: Establish accessible, air-conditioned places for vulnerable populations. Heatwave Awareness Campaigns: Educate the public on the dangers of extreme heat and protective measures. Green Spaces and Urban Planning: Increase green cover in urban areas to help reduce the urban heat island effect. For Local Governments:\nHeat Action Plans: Develop and implement comprehensive heat action plans, including early warning systems and emergency response protocols. Infrastructure Improvements: invest in sustainable infrastructure like better building insulation and green roofs. Data collection: Gather accurate temperature data to improve heatwave forecasting and targeted interventions. SE: Looking ahead, what can we expect in terms of future heatwaves in this region and globally? What are the wider implications?\nDS: Unless global greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will continue to increase globally, including in South Central Maharashtra. These changes have a knock-on effect on things like agriculture, water resources, and overall economic productivity. The broader implications are extensive and require a multifaceted approach combining mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation measures (preparing for and managing the impacts of heat). This calls for urgent and collaborative action across all sectors.\nSE: thank you, Dr. Sharma. Your insights are invaluable in understanding this pressing issue.\nConcluding Thoughts: the extreme heat in South Central Maharashtra is a stark warning of the escalating climate crisis. Understanding the causes, risks, and mitigation strategies is crucial for protecting communities and ensuring a safer future. Let’s discuss what steps you’re taking to protect yourselves from the heat in the comments below! Share your thoughts and experiences on social media using #MaharashtraHeatwave.\nMaharashtra’s Scorching Start: A Climate Expert Unravels the Extreme heat Crisis Is South Central Maharashtra facing a climate tipping point,or is this extreme heat a harbinger of what’s to come globally?\nSenior Editor (SE): dr. Anya Sharma, welcome. South Central Maharashtra is experiencing unprecedented heat, with temperatures soaring far beyond what’s typical for early March. Many are concerned this isn’t just an isolated incident. Can you provide your expert perspective?\nDr. Sharma (DS): Thank you for having me. The current heatwave gripping Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli, and Satara is indeed alarming. While individual heatwaves are influenced by short-term meteorological factors, the intensity and early arrival strongly indicate a concerning trend – a trend reflecting the accelerating impacts of climate change. This isn’t just about record-breaking temperatures; it’s a symptom of a larger, global shift towards more frequent and intense extreme weather events.\nSE: The article highlights temperatures in Solapur reaching a scorching 39.4 degrees Celsius – exceptionally high for this time of year. What are the primary drivers behind this extreme heat?\nDr. Sharma (DS): The unusually high temperatures in Solapur, and across South Central maharashtra, are a result of several interacting factors. The question of “what causes this extreme heat?” has a multifaceted answer:\nClimate Change: the undeniable primary driver is the ongoing rise in global average temperatures due to climate change. We are witnessing a warming planet, which means higher baseline temperatures and more potential for extreme heat events.\nEl niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): The ENSO cycle, characterized by fluctuations in sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, influences global weather patterns. Certain phases of ENSO can lead to warmer conditions in specific regions, perhaps exacerbating heatwaves.\nUrban Heat Island Effect: Rapid urbanization in South Central Maharashtra contributes significantly to elevated temperatures. Concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat, creating urban “heat islands” much hotter than surrounding rural areas.\nLand-Use Changes: Deforestation and alterations to land cover – including agricultural practices – impact local climate patterns. Reduced vegetation cover decreases shade, alters wind patterns, and increases heat retention.\nSE: The impact on residents is important, forcing changes to daily routines, impacting work schedules, and raising health concerns.What are the most pressing health risks associated with prolonged exposure to this extreme heat?\nDr. Sharma (DS): The question of the health risks associated with this extreme heat is a serious one. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures poses substantial health risks:\nImmediate Dangers: heat exhaustion,heatstroke,dehydration,and cardiovascular problems are immediate threats,notably for vulnerable populations like the elderly,children,and those with pre-existing health conditions.\nLong-Term Consequences: long-term exposure to extreme heat is linked to increased mortality rates, respiratory illnesses, and chronic kidney disease. Heat is a silent killer, leading to insidious health deterioration often unseen until serious problems arise.\nSE: What steps can individuals, communities, and local governments take to mitigate these risks both promptly and in the long term?\nDr. Sharma (DS): Addressing the question of mitigation requires a multi-pronged approach:\nFor Individuals:\nhydration: Prioritize drinking plenty of water throughout the day; don’t wait until you’re thirsty.\nLimit Outdoor Activity: avoid strenuous activity during peak heat hours.\nProtective Clothing: Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.\nSeek Shade: take advantage of natural shade from trees and buildings.\nMonitor Health: Learn to recognize the signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.\nFor Communities:\nCooling Centers: Establish easily accessible, air-conditioned public spaces for vulnerable populations.\nHeatwave Awareness: Implement public awareness campaigns to educate communities on heat-related risks and preventative strategies.\nUrban Greening: Increase urban green spaces to mitigate the urban heat island effect through increased shade and evapotranspiration.\nFor Local Governments:\nHeat Action Plans: Develop and implement comprehensive heat action plans, including early warning systems, emergency response protocols, and vulnerable population support networks.\nInfrastructure Investment: Invest in sustainable infrastructure such as green roofs,reflective pavements,and improved building insulation.\nData-driven Solutions: Invest in robust climate monitoring and data analysis to enhance forecasting accuracy and inform effective policymaking.\nSE: What does the future hold for South Central Maharashtra and other regions facing similar challenges? How can we prepare for increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves?\nDr. Sharma (DS): The future will likely bring even more frequent and severe heatwaves both regionally and globally unless drastic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are asking, “What is the likelihood of extreme heat increasing in the future?”.the answer is, sadly, very high with far-reaching consequences. To prepare:\nClimate Resilience: Investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and strategies are paramount.\nEarly warning Systems: Robust and accessible early warning systems are vital for timely interventions during heatwaves.\nInternational Cooperation: Global cooperation is essential; climate change is a global issue requiring collective response.\nSE: Thank you,Dr. Sharma, for these critical insights. This is indeed a pivotal moment, and your expertise highlights the urgency of collaborative action.\nConcluding Thoughts: The extreme heat gripping south Central Maharashtra serves as a stark reminder of the escalating climate crisis.

INQUIRER.net file photo/Ryan Leagogo\nThe Philippine government can cite the recent acquittal of former Sen. Leila de Lima as proof that the country’s justice system is working, thus bolstering the argument against letting the International Criminal Court (ICC) look into the “drug war” killings that occurred during the Duterte administration.\nPresident Marcos aired this view on Thursday as he stood firm on his position not to allow the entry of ICC investigators into the country.\nADVERTISEMENT READ: De Lima acquitted in last drug case\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Mayor Alice Guo is also Chinese woman Guo Hua Ping, NBI confirms NEWSINFO San Juan City probes reported ‘Basaan 2024’ chaos NEWSINFO INQToday: Alice Guo is also Chinese woman Guo Hua Ping; Dela Rosa admits drug war rights abuses “Well, maybe this is something we should show the ICC: [that] the judiciary is working properly, our investigative services are working properly and former Senator De Lima has been acquitted,” Mr. Marcos told reporters on the sidelines of the 2024 National Employment Summit at The Manila Hotel.\nOn Monday, De Lima was cleared by the Muntinlupa City court of the last of the three drug trafficking cases filed against her by the Department of Justice under then President Rodrigo Duterte.\nThe dismissal of the case was hailed as a complete vindication for the ex-senator and justice secretary—and a staunch critic of Duterte’s brutal antidrug crackdowns since his years as Davao City mayor—who had spent about seven years in jail while on trial.\nMr. Marcos declined to elaborate on his comment on the court decision. “I don’t know what further comments there could be. She (De Lima) went through trial, and was acquitted, so…”\n“We still stay with our position that the ICC has no jurisdiction in the Philippines because we have a working police force, we have a working judiciary, and do not require any assistance in that regard,” he said.\nBut he said the government would not interfere if De Lima, back in the front line as one of the leaders of the political opposition, would actively help the ICC prosecutors by providing material evidence on the drug war killings.\nADVERTISEMENT “She has said that she would like to help the ICC, but that’s between her and the ICC,” he said.\nUN hails ruling On Wednesday, the United Nations and the country’s Commission on Human Rights (CHR) hailed the court decision acquitting De Lima.\nFor Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, “her case reflects wider issues concerning the targeting of human rights defenders and other dissenting voices.”\nREAD: De Lima’s quest for vindication and justice\nLaurence urged the Marcos administration to prioritize pending legislation that would further protect human rights watchdogs in the country.\n“Accountability for human rights violations, in particular the review panel the government announced four years ago to investigate antidrug related killings of thousands during the previous administration, remains out of reach,” he noted.\nShould serve as ‘catalyst’ The CHR called the Muntinlupa court decision “a significant victory for justice and the rule of law,” drawing a lesson from De Lima’s case.\n“As Senator De Lima fully regains her freedom, her case must serve as a catalyst to continuously sound the alarm to uphold justice, protect human rights, and foster an environment where dissent is valued and respected without fear of retribution,” the CHR said in a statement.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
