    "text": "By Clark Kauffman ,\n1 hour ago The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which oversees the enforcement of nursing home regulations, took over responsibility for many of Iowa’s licensing boards in July 2023. (Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)\nSix Iowa care facilities have been cited in recent weeks for medication errors, incompetent staff, resident abuse and a death, according to state records.\nPark View Homes in Sioux City, a 45-bed facility for people with disabilities, was recently fined $8,000 by the state as a result of an inspection that took place over the course of three months, ending in late July.\nThe inspection was triggered by a complaint and three self-reported incidents, and resulted in the home being cited for five federal regulatory violations and one state regulatory violation.\nAccording to state records, two direct support professionals working in the home found a 68-year-old female resident of the home in her bed, unresponsive and not breathing, during a 5 a.m. check on May 5. No one on staff attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as the home’s policy dictated, and the resident was pronounced dead at 5:20 a.m.\nOne of the direct support professionals reportedly had a CPR certification that expired in January 2024. The other direct support professional told inspectors she couldn’t recall whether she’d received training on the home’s medical emergency policy and said she did not know whether the deceased resident had a do-not-resuscitate order in place.\nBoth workers said they were unsure as to how they should administer CPR on people who had feeding tubes in place, such as the deceased.\nAccording to inspectors, the resident had been awake in the hours before her death and had been “crying throughout the night” as if she was in pain. One of the direct support professionals reportedly told inspectors that because the “on-call nurse” that night wasn’t actually a nurse and wouldn’t know what to do he made no attempt to contact her about the resident’s condition.\nInspectors later determined the on-call nurse was not a licensed nurse but a certified medication aide who passed medications at the home. The resident’s cause of death was reported to be hypoproteinemia, indicating low protein in the blood.\nAccording to the inspectors’ reports, the home’s failure to have sufficient, competent staff placed residents in immediate jeopardy, but the situation was corrected on May 10. However, the same reports indicate the medication aide remained as the “on-call nurse” until May 13 when the director of nursing returned from vacation.\nIn June, while the state inspection at Park View Homes was still underway, the facility was cited for two federal violations and one state violation. That resulted in a $5,000 fine for failing to provide residents with their prescribed food.\nThe home had allegedly fed one resident fettuccini with whole shrimp, despite dietary restrictions that indicated he was to be given only small, bite-size food pieces to prevent choking. The resident subsequently choked on his meal, was unable to speak, and had to be given the Heimlich maneuver to clear his airway.\nOther Iowa care facilities recently cited for violations include:\n— Fort Dodge Health and Rehabilitation , which was fined $500 for failing to report resident abuse to state regulators. A staff member allegedly reported that a certified nursing assistant spoke to a female resident of the home in an abusive manner after the woman had an episode of incontinence. The CNA allegedly told the woman, “We need to get you on the commode so you will stop s—-ing your pants, I don’t have time for this,” and then walked out of the resident’s room.\n— Stacyville Community Nursing Home , which was fined $5,000 for giving a resident the wrong medication, resulting in the resident being admitted to a local hospital. The home was also cited for insufficient staffing and failing to have a registered nurse in the building for eight consecutive hours or more, in violation of federal requirements.\nAccording to inspectors, the home had failed to schedule a registered nurse on 10 separate days between February and July. The administrator told inspectors she mistakenly believed the home had been granted a waiver on the nurse-staffing requirement. The $5,000 fine for the medication error has been held in suspension by the state.\n— Hillcrest Health Care Center of Hawarden , which was fined $25,500 in July for failing to follow dietary restrictions and repeatedly giving residents meals that posed a choking risk. The home had been cited for the same violation, and fined $8,500, in January. Both the January and July fines have been held in suspension by the state.\n— Aase Hagen Home of Decorah , which was fined 4,500 by the state for failing to protect residents from hazards. The violation was tied to injuries sustained by a resident who fell out of a mechanical lift that was being used to transfer the individual in or out of bed. Because this was a repeat violation, the $4,500 fine was tripled to $13,500, and then held in suspension by the state.\n— Osage Rehab and Health Care Center , which was fined $7,250 for leaving a resident flat on his back in bed during tube feeding, even after the resident had vomited. The man was subsequently taken to a hospital and admitted to a critical care unit and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and septic shock. Two weeks after the incident, the man was still in the hospital and was gravely ill, with possible brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation, according to inspectors. A family member of the resident reportedly told inspectors that in the past he had twice advised the staff to refrain from feeding the man while he was flat on his back, but the staff was “incompetent and failed to listen.” The $7,250 fine has been held in suspension by the state.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "NFL Wild Card Weekend parlay: Let's make some money",
    "text": "We're heading into the NFL postseason, and we have 6 games on the schedule for NFL Wild Card Weekend . Weather is going to play a huge factor, which is something we'll be watching awfully close as it affects our plays. Saturday's K.C. outlook -- when the Kansas City Chiefs (11-6) host the Miami Dolphins (11-6) -- calls for 0 degrees with winds at 13-16 MPH. The good news is that there is no precipitation in the forecast. The same cannot be said for Orchard Park, N.Y., where the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7) visit the Buffalo Bills (11-6) Sunday. They will not only face temperatures of 21 degrees, but there is a 60% chance of snow with 22-24 MPH winds. This season, the Under cashed at a 14-2-1 rate in games played with an average wind speed of 13 MPH or greater. Wrapping up the schedule Monday, rain is expected in Tampa. There is a 70% chance of the wet stuff, but at least temperatures will be in the upper 60's with a 6-8 MPH. After looking at FanDuel Sportsbook's NFL Wild Card Weekend odds , here is our \"Let's make some money\" NFL parlay bet to cash in on among SportbookWire's NFL expert picks and predictions . We have 3 rematches from the regular season, too. In fact, the Cleveland Browns (11-6) and Houston Texans (10-7) just met in Week 16 at NRG Stadium in Houston with the Browns winning 36-22 as 3-point favorites with the Over (40) easily connecting. The Dolphins and Chiefs probably wish they could go back to Frankfurt, Germany, and play, instead of being in a refrigerator this weekend. Kansas City earned a 21-14 win over Miami in Germany back in Week 9, covering as a 1-point underdog as the Under (51.5) cashed. Lastly, the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8) met for Monday Night Football in Tampa back in Week 3. Philadelphia came away with a 25-11 win and cover as a 5.5-point favorite as the Under (44) hit. That was a while ago, and Philly was playing much better football. They meet again in Tampa this Monday for the final game of the Wild Card round. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: Get ESPN+ Odds provided by FanDuel Sportsbook ; access USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET. All games ET. There is a lot being made out of geography ahead of this game. Obviously, the Dolphins play in tropical conditions more often than not, rarely having to deal with low temperatures. We're not likely going to see Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa spinning it frequently. Expect both teams to count on the run. Both of the Dolphins RBs, Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane , are capable of housing it, while the Chiefs counter with RB Isiah Pacheco . With their physical styles, all 3 should be tough to tackle on a frigid afternoon. The combination of Mostert and Achane will wear down the defending champs, helping the warm-weather Dolphins keep it close and cover. Plus, the public drove this number up quite a bit, from an open of 1.5, and I never like siding with the public. The weather is going to be absolutely atrocious. If you love a good snow game, then you are going to love the weather at Highmark Stadium Sunday. The forecast calls for temperatures around 20 degrees with a 60 percent or greater chance of snow throughout the game. If that wasn't enough, they're calling for winds whipping off of Lake Erie anywhere from 22-26 MPH with gusts to gale force. We're unlikely to see much in the way of passing as Steelers QB Mason Rudolph and Bills QB Josh Allen would do well to keep it on the ground. Allen and the Bills will have a leg up as he can tuck it and go. Buffalo RB James Cook is likely to see a strong workload, too. In addition to the passing games being hindered, the kicking game will be affected, too. Think back to Dec. 6, 2021, when the Bills hosted the New England Patriots on a Monday night, and we had snow and ice with heavy winds crushing the pass and kick games. In fact, field-goal attempts were downright comical. We're going to get one of those kind of games, and points are going to be at a premium. The Packers (9-8) head into Jerry World , and it could be considered the Mike McCarthy revenge game. The Dallas coach will get a crack at his former employer, and while the personnel has mostly changed, the logo on the helmet remains the same. More importantly, though, the Packers barely made the playoffs, while the Cowboys (12-5) caught fire at the end of the season, blew past the Eagles and rolled to the NFC East title. The Cowboys scored 33 or more points in 6 of the final 9 games as QB Dak Prescott had the offense humming. The Packers won 3 games down the stretch, but all of those victories came against non-playoff teams. Wins are wins, and Green Bay qualified for the playoffs, but they're not likely going to be around very long. Green Bay was just 2-5 ATS in its final 7 road games, while Dallas went 6-2 ATS in 8 games this season at home. Parlay payout: Bet $10 to profit $58.14 (payout = $68.14). Try out the USA TODAY Parlay Calculator . *-If you want to add a 4th play to this parlay. The Browns and Texans kick off the Wild Card round in H-Town, and as mentioned, these teams are familiar with each other. Cleveland fired out to a 22-7 lead by halftime in their 1st meeting and led 36-7 with 12:31 to go, before settling for the 36-22 victory. Don't expect the same type of high-scoring game, but the winning result should be the same. The Browns finished with 418 total yards of offense in that 1st meeting with QB Joe Flacco throwing for 368 yards, and WR Amari Cooper setting a single-game franchise record with 265 receiving yards on 11 catches with 2 TDs. It's safe to say Cooper won't have anywhere near that production -- if he even plays at all. He has been sidelined with a heel injury. The matchup features Houston rookie QB C.J. Stroud against the former Super Bowl MVP Flacco. Experience will be a huge difference. Flacco has been the consummate professional since landing in Cleveland, and he and the starters are well-rested after basically a week off. Nearly all starters sat in Week 18 at Cincinnati with the team locked into the AFC's No. 5 seed. So the bumps and bruises are mended, and this Browns team is ready to roll.

    "text": "\"¿Test de drogas para el deshonesto Joe Biden ? Yo estaría inmediatamente de acuerdo con hacérmelo\", señalaba Donald Trump esta semana para calentar el debate. El candidato republicano volvía a sacar a colación la debilidad de su rival, dando a entender que el actual presidente no podría aguantar un cara a cara sin la ayuda de fármacos estimulantes.\nEl ala más dura del Partido Republicano aprovechó las horas previas al debate para poner el foco en la negativa de los Demócratas a que pasase dicho test, alimentando la idea del mal estado de salud de Biden.\nLa portavoz de campaña del presidente, Adrienne Elrod , rechazó cualquier posibilidad de realizar el test, dando a entender que se trata de una idea absurda.\n[La promesa de Trump si es reelegido: \"La operación de deportación más grande en la historia de EEUU\"] La salud de ambos es uno de los elementos que tendrán en cuenta los votantes en unos comicios que enfrentarán al octogenario presidente con un Trump que entraría en esa misma década durante su hipotético segundo mandato presidencial.\nLos ataques a la salud de Biden han sido una constante durante toda la presidencia del político de Pensilvania, cuyas caídas y tropezones han sido utilizadas desde el partido del elefante para subrayar su vejez. También han hecho hincapié en estos años en su salud mental, empleando para ello los extraños silencios en algunas de sus intervenciones públicas, o los notables lapsus en las respuestas a periodistas.\n[El Supremo marca la carrera electoral en EEUU: la inmunidad de Donald Trump, armas y aborto] Trump ya usó una estrategia similar hace ocho años , cuando cuestionó el estado de salud de Hillary Clinton, su rival demócrata por la presidencia en 2016. \"Hillary Clinton no tiene la entereza, la fortaleza o la resistencia para liderar nuestro mundo\", decía un anuncio televisivo de la campaña de Trump de aquel año. \"Ella fracasó como Secretaria de Estado. No dejes que nos vuelva a fallar\".\nDe hecho, el multimillonario también reclamó que Clinton pasase un test de drogas previo al debate final de octubre durante la campaña presidencial de hace ocho años. \"A los atletas les obligan a someterse a un control de drogas. Deberíamos hacernos una prueba antes del debate porque no sé qué le pasa. Al comienzo de su último debate, ella estaba muy entusiasmada al comienzo, pero al final, apenas podía llegar a su coche\", afirmó en un discurso.\nAsí van las encuestas El presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden, y su rival, el expresidente Donald Trump, llegan al debate de este jueves en CNN con un empate en las encuestas a nivel nacional, pero con Trump por delante en la mayoría de los estados que serán clave en las elecciones de noviembre.\nSegún la media de encuestas del portal FiveThirtyEight , Trump tiene un 41 % de intención de voto , frente al 40,9% de Biden , que ha recuperado terreno en las últimas semanas.\n[Ni con Biden ni con Trump: los \"dobles odiadores\" podrían tener la llave de las elecciones de EEUU] Para el demócrata, una buena actuación en el debate es vital a la hora de mejorar en los sondeos y despejar parte de las dudas sobre si puede gestionar un segundo mandato con 81 años.\nLa última encuesta nacional, publicada por The New York Times , da a Trump una ventaja de tres puntos sobre Biden , con un 40% de la intención de voto entre los probables votantes.\nUn debate decisivo Los sondeos ponen a ambos candidatos dentro o a muy poca distancia del margen de error, con lo que la actuación en el debate de hoy , el más temprano de la historia, puede ser decisiva para cambiar la tendencia en las encuestas y orientar la percepción de los votantes.\nLas encuestas en los estados decisivos , los que se pueden inclinar a uno u otro candidato, dan ventajas a Trump en la mayoría. En Míchigan, Wisconsin y Pensilvania, el margen es de empate técnico, mientras que Trump tiene márgenes claros de ventaja en Georgia, Carolina del Norte, Nevada y Arizona.\nEste debate es histórico , no sólo porque llega antes de las convenciones de ambos partidos (nunca antes se había celebrado un cara a cara antes de septiembre), sino por la edad de los candidatos ( 78 años Trump, 81 Biden ).\nAdemás, es el primero que no organiza la Comisión de Debates Presidenciales desde 1988 y el primero desde el debate televisivo inaugural de 1960 entre John F. Kennedy y Richard Nixon que no tiene público.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Denton County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Denton County, Texas from 1901-2000 was 45.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Denton County, Texas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Denton County, Texas history.",

    "text": "With loud cheering and a cheerful pop, the cork pops out of the bottle and then drills into the ceiling at a rapid pace. A dent in the plasterwork remains as a permanent reminder of a great party. But a flying champagne cork can be dazzling, [warns the largest association of ophthalmologists in the world, American Academy of Opthamology, in 2023.](https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/ophthalmologists-warn-flying-champagne-corks-cause) How big is the danger of the champagne cork really? A champagne cork shoots past a car The bubbles in your bottle of champagne build up as much as six bar of pressure behind the cork, three times as high as the pressure in a car tire. With this push it will easily fly into the air at eighty kilometers per hour, especially if you shake it again before popping the bottle. You can do it at that speed [a well-aimed champagne cork travels a record distance of more than fifty-four meters](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66345-longest-champagne-cork-flight). And yes, it is of course not nice if you get that in your eye. Into the hospital thanks to victory potion Cyclist Biniam Girmay can speak to that. He had to retire from the Giro d’Italia in 2022 after the cork from his victory bubbles hit his eye. He was admitted to hospital due to a bleeding in his eye. A bad idea, but the chance of this happening to you is extremely small. In [an older study from 2004 from the University of Alabama (USA)](https://bjo.bmj.com/content/88/1/69?ijkey=df3b98db1136ef5bc26dbb53d1ae76a048790101&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) almost thirteen thousand eye injuries from three countries were listed. There were only ninety corking accidents. Still a better chance than winning the lottery, by the way. This had serious consequences for the few unlucky ones who literally looked a little too deeply into the bottle of champagne. A quarter of them remained blind in the injured eye. Uncorking champagne: that’s how it goes Fortunately, you can prevent these types of injuries by opening a bottle of champagne properly. The loud bang with splashing foam looks nice on the podium of a car circuit, but… [You officially open champagne with a controlled pop, or a breath.](https://www.champagne.fr/en/about-champagne/a-great-blended-wine/champagne-bottles-bottling) To make controlled opening easier, it is best to choose a chilled and large bottle, because the pressure is lower. With one hand securely on the cork, gently wiggle the cork free with your other hand. This way you won’t shoot any eyes out. And although it looks less spectacular than when the foam is swirling around the room, there is more champagne left to enjoy this way. What about the other alcoholic refreshments at your party? For example, can you still drink expired beer? And should you choose beer first or wine first to avoid the sting? 2023-12-28 18:22:24 #champagne #cork #flies #air #speed #car #dangerous",
