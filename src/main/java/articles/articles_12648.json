    "title": "AI for Lower Drug Costs: Finding Cheaper Repurposed Meds",
    "text": "Summary and Key Highlights Summary: This section delves into the potential for AI to transform drug repurposing by evaluating millions of drug-disease possibilities, identifying low-cost drugs that could be effective against various conditions. AI's ability to sift through vast amounts of data allows researchers to find inexpensive drugs that can be tested and fast-tracked into clinical trials. This approach opens up new opportunities to address diseases with affordable medications, bypassing the traditional, often costly drug development process. However, the discussion also acknowledges the regulatory challenges that could arise from using AI in this way. Key Takeaways: - AI can evaluate millions of drug-disease combinations to find low-cost treatment options. - Inexpensive, effective drugs identified through AI can be rapidly tested and adopted. - Regulatory issues will need to be addressed when applying AI-driven drug repurposing.
