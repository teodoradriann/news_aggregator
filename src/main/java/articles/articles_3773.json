    "title": "Croatia: Adverse weather forecast across much of the country through at least Aug. 3 | Crisis24",
    "text": "Severe weather forecast across much of Croatia through at least Aug. 3. Disruptions to transport, business, and utilities possible. Severe weather is forecast across much of Croatia through at least Aug. 3. Thunderstorms are forecast to break out across much of the country; heavy rainfall, strong wind gusts, lightning, and possible hail may accompany the storms. Heavy downpours could trigger flooding in low-lying communities, and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages. As of Aug. 2, Croatia's State Hydrometeorological Institute (DHMZ) has issued the following weather warnings across the country: Orange thunderstorm warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Karlovac and Zagreb regions. Yellow thunderstorm warnings: Gospic, Knin, Osijek, Rijeka, and Split regions. Further yellow thunderstorm warnings are in place across the country with the exception of Dubrovnik Region Aug. 3. Officials could update and possibly extend the coverage of the weather alerts over the coming hours and days. The storms could produce rounds of heavy rainfall, strong winds, and isolated thunderstorm activity across the affected areas. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where the soil has become saturated by heavy rainfall. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding, landslides, or strong winds impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Strong winds might also pose a hazard to high-profile vehicles. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports across the affected areas. Authorities may temporarily suspend port operations or close beach fronts along the Adriatic coast if strong winds trigger hazardous sea conditions. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas that see heavy rainfall and potential track inundation. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for updated emergency and weather information. Seek updated information on weather and road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast. Plan accordingly for potential delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through affected areas. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "title": "GO TO PRISON FOR FOUR MONTHS OR FOREVER, STEVE BANNON",
    "text": "HALLELUJAH, for once in American history we are legitimately writing a happy blog post.\nSteve Bannon — that unbathed, becrusted, decaying husk of matted pubic hair and lack of remorse —\nhas been ordered to report to prison on July 1. He must finally begin his four-month prison sentence for ignoring Congress’s subpoenas back in the old days of the House January 6 Select Committee, when Congress was actually trying to investigate the Donald Trump-inspired terrorist attack on the Capitol.\nThe appeals have run out, he may not pass go, so it’s time for him to stuff all the things up his butt he thinks he can manage to smuggle into the prison, only to have them confiscated on his first day by the guards.\nNo favorite blankie for you ever again for four months, fucker!\nSteve Bannon is heretofore to be known as a number, and nothing more. He is to be addressed as “inmate.”\nYou are not an inmate! You are a paying subscriber.\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, ruled that postponing prison is now pointless, because, per\nPolitico, “a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled strongly and unanimously last month against Bannon’s position.”\nBannon can appeal this, and he’s going to, both to the en banc Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court, but is anybody really going to save that rotting cadaver of meanness and sickness smells? Doubt it. And July 1 just isn’t that far away.\nBut sure, dude, cry out for help:\n“We’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,” Bannon said after Nichols’ decision. “There’s not a prison built or jail built that will shut me up.”\nAssuming the prison reporting date sticks, Bannon will get out just before the November election. He will likely not remember his name, nor will he understand how to use phones or computers or microwaves anymore, because they will be totally different from the old-timey ones that existed before he went in. All his favorite shows will have gone off the air, and all his friends and God will have forgotten him, just as everybody and God has forgotten Trump idiot Peter Navarro, who is\ncurrently in prison for similar reasons. (Notably, SCOTUS told Peter Navarro to go eat prison food in prison when he begged them for a reprieve, if that gives you any indication of how they might lean on Bannon. The circumstances aren’t exactly the same, but close enough.)\nPoint is, four months is a very long time, and life moves on.\nOn the bright side, there is a good chance Bannon will learn how to make a birdhouse during that time, or at least some alcoholic refreshments out of the toilet.\nBannon is of course welcome to die in there, as he is 70 years old but by the looks of him, his bodily organs are probably about 140.\nWhatever. Up to God.\nEvan has a new side project called\nThe Moral High Ground, you should check it out and subscribe there too!\nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter\nright here.\n@evanjosephhurst on Threads!\nIf you're shopping on Amazon anyway, this portal gives us a small commission.",

    "text": "Os 10% mais ricos da população mundial são responsáveis por dois terços do aquecimento global desde 1990 e pelo aumento de eventos climáticos extremos, como ondas de calor e secas, derivados da crise climática, segundo um estudo.\nA investigação, publicada na revista Nature Climate Change e citado na quarta-feira pela agência Efe, avaliou até que ponto os diferentes grupos e sociedades contribuem para as emissões e revelou que o 1% mais rico do mundo contribuiu 26 vezes mais do que a média global para o aumento dos extremos de temperatura global e 17 vezes mais para as secas na Amazónia.\nO trabalho, conduzido pela ETH Zurich (Suíça), mostra a relação entre a desigualdade de emissões baseada no rendimento e a injustiça climática, revelando que o consumo e os investimentos dos ricos tiveram e continuam a ter um impacto desproporcional nos eventos climáticos extremos.\nEstes efeitos são \"especialmente graves em regiões tropicais vulneráveis, como a Amazónia, o Sudeste Asiático e o Sul de África\", que historicamente têm contribuído menos para as emissões globais.\nO estudo mostra que os impactos climáticos extremos não são apenas o resultado de emissões globais abstratas, mas \"podem estar diretamente ligados a estilos de vida e escolhas de investimento, que por sua vez estão ligados à riqueza\", sublinhou Sarah Schöngart, investigadora da ETH Zurique e principal autora do estudo.\n\"Verificámos que os emissores ricos desempenham um papel significativo na condução dos extremos climáticos\", e isso \"fornece um forte apoio às políticas climáticas que visam reduzir as suas emissões\", salientou Schöngart.\nUtilizando um modelo que combinava dados económicos e simulações climáticas, os investigadores conseguiram rastrear as emissões de diferentes grupos de rendimentos globais e avaliar a sua contribuição para extremos climáticos específicos.\nAssim, descobriram que as emissões dos 10% mais ricos da população dos Estados Unidos e da China, somente, multiplicaram as temperaturas extremas em regiões vulneráveis em duas ou três vezes.\n\"Se todos tivessem emitido como os 50% mais pobres da população global, o aquecimento global teria sido mínimo desde 1990\", garantiu Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, coautor do estudo e diretor do Grupo de Investigação de Impactos Climáticos Integrados do IIASA.\n\"Corrigir este desequilíbrio é crucial para uma ação climática justa e eficaz\", lembrou o investigador.\nO estudo também destaca a importância das emissões ligadas a investimentos financeiros e afirma que focar-se nos fluxos financeiros e nas carteiras de indivíduos com rendimentos elevados pode gerar benefícios climáticos substanciais.\nOs autores acreditam que estas descobertas podem ajudar a lançar instrumentos de políticas progressistas dirigidas às elites sociais e realçam que fazer os poluidores ricos pagarem também pode fornecer o apoio muito necessário para a adaptação e perdas e danos em países vulneráveis.\nReequilibrar a responsabilidade pela ação climática de acordo com o contributo real para as emissões \"é essencial\", não só para conter o aquecimento global, \"mas também para alcançar um mundo mais justo e resiliente\", concluem os autores.",

    "title": "Humanitarian aid packages are dropped over war-torn Gaza as Israeli bombardment of Palestinian territory rages on | Express Digest",
    "text": "Humanitarian aid has been dropped into war-torn Gaza once again, as Israel continues its deadly campaign against the Palestinian territory. A Spanish charity ship carrying food aid was expected to soon set sail from the Mediterranean island-nation of Cyprus to help alleviate the suffering in the coastal Gaza Strip, now in its sixth month of war. The non-governmental group Open Arms said its boat would carry 200 tonnes of food, which its partner the US charity World Central Kitchen would then unload on the shores of Gaza where it had constructed a basic dock. As famine looms in parts of besieged Gaza, US, Jordanian and other planes have also airdropped food aid there, but UN agencies warn this falls far short of the needs of its 2.4 million people. The war, started by the October 7 attack on Israel, has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where vast swathes have been reduced to a bombed-out wasteland. Humanitarian aid was being airdropped over the Palestinian territory The war, started by the October 7 attack on Israel , has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have aimed for a six-week truce and the release of many of the about 100 hostages Hamas is still holding in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, with no result so far. The widely shared target had been to halt the fighting by the start of Ramadan, which is expected to begin Monday depending on the first sighting of the crescent moon. Both sides have blamed each other for failing to reach a ceasefire deal so far, after Israel had demanded a full list of surviving hostages, and Hamas had called for Israel to pull out all its troops from Gaza. Israel’s government accused Hamas of ‘entrenching its positions like someone who is not interested in a deal and is striving to inflame the region during Ramadan’. US President Joe Biden reiterated Saturday that Israel has ‘a right to continue to pursue Hamas’, but also stressed his growing impatience with Israel’s right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As the civilian death toll has surged, Biden told broadcaster MSNBC Netanyahu ‘must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken’. At this stage, said Biden, Netanyahu’s approach to the war was ‘hurting Israel more than helping Israel’. Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have aimed for a six-week truce and the release of many of the about 100 hostages Hamas is still holding in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, with no result so far Both sides have blamed each other for failing to reach a ceasefire deal so far US President Joe Biden reiterated Saturday that Israel has ‘a right to continue to pursue Hamas’ The comments came after Israeli protesters again took to the streets of Tel Aviv in growing anti-government rallies, joined by some of the desperate families and friends of the remaining captives. Biden also signalled he would be willing to speak directly to the Israeli people through an address to the Knesset legislature, but without revealing any further plans or details. The war started when Hamas launched their unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in about 1,160 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures. The militants also took 250 hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes 99 hostages remain alive and that 31 have died. Israel’s withering bombardment and ground offensive have killed 31,045 people, mostly women and children, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday. It has also said at least 23 children have died from malnutrition and dehydration. Inside Gaza, displaced Palestinians were lining up at a truck carrying scarce drinking water, which they filled into jerry cans and plastic containers.

The Israeli military said its troops had killed 13 militants in air strikes and with tank and sniper fire in central Gaza over the past day. Troops were also engaged in ‘close-quarter combat’ in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where strikes had killed 17 militants. The army has reported that 248 of its forces have died in Gaza, where it claims to have killed more than 10,000 militants. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel was preparing for ‘all possible operational scenarios’ during Ramadan. ‘Shortly before Ramadan, Hamas is preventing a deal and is acting against what was raised by the mediators,’ he said. The Israeli military said its troops had killed 13 militants in air strikes and with tank and sniper fire in central Gaza over the past day Biden last Thursday announced that the US military would build a temporary pier on Gaza’s coast to facilitate larger aid shipments by sea The army earlier dropped leaflets with pictures of Hamas leaders enjoying a lavish meal and Palestinians with near-empty plates. One Gaza man, Attallah al-Satel, told AFP: ‘What is the purpose of this leaflet? We want a solution, to stop the war. We are just exhausted citizens.’ Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh called for the speedy distribution of aid and the full opening of border crossings ‘to end the siege of our people’. Biden last Thursday announced that the US military would build a temporary pier on Gaza’s coast to facilitate larger aid shipments by sea, but the Pentagon warned this would take about 60 days. The US Central Command said a ship had left Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia on Saturday carrying the ‘first equipment to establish a temporary pier’ to receive aid off Gaza. International Committee of the Red Cross chief Mirjana Spoljaric again called for a ceasefire and for both sides to respect international law and protect civilians. ‘It is the line between humanity and barbarity,’ she said, adding that the situation was degenerating ‘by the hour’ in a war that had ‘ruptured any sense of a shared humanity’. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13179457/Humanitarian-aid-packages-dropped-war-torn-Gaza-Israeli-bombardment-Palestinian-territory-rages-on.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "title": "Fausto Vera rompió el silencio por su salida a Boca o Atlético Mineiro: \"Me dicen ingrato...\"",
    "text": "El volante, que tomó protagonismo en las últimas semanas, habló sobre su situación actual y se refirió a su futuro. Para este mercado de pases, Boca fue a buscar volantes y uno de los primeros nombres que circuló fue el de Fausto Vera. Desde Buenos Aires enviaron ofertas, pero estas no pudieron convencer a la dirigencia de Corinthians. Mientras tanto, apareció un competidor en Brasil y todos los caminos parecen conducir a una nueva experiencia en el país vecino, esta vez con la camiseta de Atlético Mineiro. A la espera de la resolución por su futuro, el mediocampista argentino rompió el silencio y en una entrevista con UOL Esporte, se refirió a su salida y las polémicas que giraron en torno a ello. “Quiero aclarar esta situación. Me califican de desagradecido y es todo lo contrario. Siempre estaré agradecido y es un orgullo vestir esta camiseta”, confesó Vera. Fausto Vera rompió el silencio tras las ofertas de Boca y Atlético Mineiro. Foto: Getty Luego, sumó: “Estoy muy tranquilo y quería transmitir a la afición que todo lo que se dice no es cierto. Cuando apareció la propuesta del Atlético-MG hablé con el técnico y la directiva. Llegamos a un acuerdo de que yo me quedaría fuera de los partidos para que la junta pudiera resolver el tema de la venta”. ¿Qué dijo Fausto Vera sobre su salida de Corinthians? A mediados de 2022, el Timao mostró interés en el juvenil surgido de las inferiores de Argentinos Juniors y casi dos años después, tiene muchísimas chances de buscar rodaje en otro club. En esta entrevista, el mediocampista de 24 años dio su punto de vista sobre las ofertas recientes y puso en la mesa algunos aspectos claves. “Siempre he entrenado bien en el Corinthians. Siempre agradecido con el club, dando lo mejor de mí dentro y fuera del campo. El Corinthians me compró y tiene una deuda con el club anterior. Llegó una propuesta interesante para mí y para el club, con un dinero interesante de un club que el entrenador me conoce y quiere que yo esté en el equipo para ayudar a reducir la deuda. Estoy muy tranquilo y quería transmitirlo”, resaltó. Además, dio sus motivos para cambiar de aires y cerró: “Llegué al club en 2022, el club gastó mucho dinero. Vítor Pereira siempre me usó en esa posición, jugué muy bien y más de lo que la afición esperaba, porque en Brasil no era muy conocido. En 2023 los entrenadores empezaron a ponerme como segundo mediocampista e incluso en la derecha. Siempre tuve que adaptarme a posiciones que no son mi posición principal, pero trato de adaptarme”. ¿Cuánto había ofrecido Boca por Fausto Vera? Teniendo en cuenta la posición en la fase de grupos de la Copa Sudamericana, el Xeneize sabía de antemano que iba a disputar el playoff y para esta serie contra Independiente del Valle, tendrá sus bajas, principalmente en la mitad de la cancha. Ante esto, el Consejo de Fútbol inició gestiones por varios jugadores y uno de ellos era Fausto Vera. El cuadro de la Ribera hizo una oferta de 2 millones de dólares por el 50% del pase y Corinthians la consideró insuficiente. Unos días después, apareció Atlético Mineiro y Gabriel Milito cumplió con un rol fundamental al conocerlo de su paso por Argentinos Juniors. El Galo se movió rápidamente y quedó a un paso de contratarlo a cambio de 4 millones de dólares. Lectura recomendada:",
