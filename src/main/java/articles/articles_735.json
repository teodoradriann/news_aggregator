    "text": "29 Nov 2024 | 09:24 PM UTC\nSouth Korea: Unionized transport, education, and public sector workers to launch coordinated nationwide strike Dec. 2\nWorkers affiliated with several labor unions to strike across South Korea starting Dec. 2. Public transport, business disruptions likely.\nWorkers affiliated represented by several labor unions, particularly in the transport, education, and public services sectors, plan to launch a series of coordinated strikes in South Korea on Dec. 2. The Cargo Truckers Solidarity, an affiliate of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), will hold a three-day strike from Dec. 2. Additionally, Korea Railroad (KORAIL) employees represented by the Korean Railway Workers' Union (KRWU) will stage an indefinite work stoppage starting Dec. 5, with workers employed by Seoul Metro walking off the job starting Dec. 6. Certain unionized public service employees, including those at the National Pension Service and Korea Gas in the South Korean capital, will also participate in a walkout, as will education workers affiliated with the KCTU. The purpose of the labor action is to demand improved working conditions and condemn alleged workplace discrimination, among other things. Unless averted, the labor action will likely prompt significant transport and business disruptions.\nIncreased demand for alternative modes of transportation is likely. Organizers may suspend or cancel the labor action at short notice if they perceive that authorities may give in to some of their demands.\nAlthough there were no immediate announcements for such gatherings, related demonstrations of varying types are possible. Potential gathering sites include the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport building and Seoul Metro facilities, as well as other government buildings, public squares, and thoroughfares. Authorities will likely monitor any demonstrations that materialize and may disperse overly unruly crowds. Isolated minor skirmishes between strike participants and police cannot be ruled out.\nPlan accordingly for likely disruptions to rail services nationwide and metro services in Seoul during the strike. Schedule alternative modes of transportation as necessary. Confirm business appointments in advance. Consider alternate arrangements for freights shipped by truck starting Dec. 2. As a precaution, avoid any demonstration that materializes. Depart the area at the first sign of any security disturbance. Heed all official transport and security advisories.",

    "text": "Boutique Japanese audio company, Final Audio, has just announced its latest wireless earbuds and they’re priced at a surprisingly accessible $100. The ZE3000 SV are effectively the second generation of the company’s $149 ZE3000 — some of the best-sounding earbuds I’ve ever tested under $200 — and yet they appear to have many improvements and a much lower price. They’ll be available on Amazon and Final Audio’s website in the coming days.\nWhile the ZE3000 are notable for their audio quality, Final neglected to include many of the features we’ve come to expect on wireless earbuds, like noise cancellation and Bluetooth Multipoint. They can do hi-res audio, but only via Qualcomm’s aptX Adaptive codec, which isn’t available on the most popular smartphones.\nThe ZE3000 SV address all of these concerns. Final’s says its new “Comfort ANC” has been designed to balance sound quality and sound isolation performance. Multipoint is on tap for connecting two devices simultaneously, and Final has swapped aptX Adaptive for Sony’s hi-res LDAC codec, which is available on all Android smartphones (though not on iPhones).\nAll of these are welcome additions, but not if the come at the expense of audio quality. Apparently Final has found a way to maintain the ZE3000’s excellent performance through the use of new, larger 10mm “f-Core SV drivers” and f-LINK Port technology. It “optimizes the pressure of the acoustic space while maintaining a secure waterproof performance. This allows significant control of low frequencies, which is typically difficult to achieve in true wireless products. It produces realistically vivid vocals, kick drums, and bass lines that hit hard without overpowering the overall balance.”\nBattery life remains the same at a claimed 7 hours of playtime (28 with the charging case) though it’s not clear how the use of ANC and LDAC will affect these numbers. The ZE3000 SV are also IPX4 water-resistant and they can be customized via the Final Connect App.\nThey also feature a gaming mode, though I’m a bit surprised by the description: “Gaming Mode can be activated via the Final Connect app and will instantly achieve a low latency connection of up to 60ms – speeds unheard of with standard Bluetooth connections.” 60 milliseconds is certainly an improvement over what you’d normally expect with SBC, AAC, or LDAC codecs (these can run as high as 350ms), but there are many wireless earbuds that promise low latency modes as fast as 45ms.\nRegardless, I’m very excited to try the ZE3000 SV. If they sound as good as the ZE3000, they’ll be a bargain.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Israeli forces fatally shoot Palestinian who stabbed 2 security workers Fleeing Palestinians have packed into areas along Gaza's border with Egypt and the southern Mediterranean coastline, where shelters and tent camps are overflowing. The UN humanitarian office says the scale and intensity of ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups and their devastating impact is impeding aid deliveries. The Israeli military's air and ground offensive against Hamas has widened to most of the territory. Israel says it is striking militant targets, though homes full of people are regularly crushed. Israeli forces bombarded cities, towns and refugee camps across Gaza overnight and into Thursday, killing dozens of people. More than 20,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead. About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza. Here's what's happening in the war: ISRAELI FORCES FATALLY SHOOT PALESTINIAN WHO STABBED 2 SECURITY WORKERS JERUSALEM -- Israeli security forces have shot and killed a Palestinian man who stabbed two people at a checkpoint between the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Israeli police say the man got out of his car and stabbed two security workers before he was shot dead. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the two security workers — a 20-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man — were in moderate condition. The occupied West Bank has experienced a surge in violence since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in unrest and clashes with Israeli forces. NO ACTION AGAINST ISRAELI SOLDIERS IN MISTAKEN KILLING OF 3 HOSTAGES JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has completed its investigation into the mistaken killing of three Israeli hostages, saying the event “should not have occurred” and could have been prevented but taking no disciplinary action. The three hostages, Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Al-Talalka, 25 and Alon Shamriz, were mistakenly shot by Israeli forces on Dec. 15 after exiting a building in a Gaza City neighbourhood where intense battles had taken place. Announcing the results of its investigation, the army on Thursday confirmed initial reports that the men had emerged from the building shirtless and waving a white flag, apparently trying to signal they posed no threat. Two men were killed immediately, while the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. The commander issued an order to cease-fire, but another burst of gunfire killed the third man. The army said that complex battle conditions, limited visibility and noise from nearby tanks that prevented troops from hearing their commanders’ instructions contributed to the fatal event. “The fighting creates many complex and difficult situations,” army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference. “After entire days of encountering explosives, watching your friends die, having RPGs fired at you, encountering terrorists wearing civilian clothes without a weapon, pulling you toward all kinds of explosives in the streets — in that situation, a soldier stood at a window with limited visibility. He made a mistake,” he said. The army’s chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said the soldiers had violated open-fire procedures because the hostages did not pose a threat. But he said “there was no malice in the event” and the soldiers acted “to the best of their understanding.” U.S., ISRAELI DEFENSE CHIEFS SPEAK ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN MILITARY CAMPAIGN WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday to discuss Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and preparations for the stabilization phase that will follow major combat operations. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said Austin reiterated U.S. resolve to ensure Hamas can no longer threaten Israel’s security and he also underscored “the importance of protecting Gaza’s civilians and accelerating humanitarian assistance.” Ryder said Austin and Gallant also discussed other threats to regional security, including Hezbollah's activities in southern Lebanon, Houthi attacks against ships in the Red Sea, and Iranian-backed militia attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria. HAMAS OFFICIAL SAYS END TO WAR MUST BE FINAL, NOT TEMPORARY BEIRUT -- A Hamas official said Thursday that the Palestinian militant group is “open to any ideas or proposals for a complete and final cessation of aggression against our people in the Gaza Strip.” Osama Hamdan said the group is not interested in a “partial or temporary cessation of aggression” and reiterated the group’s official position that the remaining hostages who have been held in Gaza since the group launched its deadly Oct. 7 incursion into Israel would only be released after a permanent ceasefire is implemented. He was responding to a question at a press conference about the ongoing discussions regarding roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war -- including a proposal Egypt recently suggested. As for the enclave’s post-war governance, Hamdan said it would be a “decision of the Palestinian people alone” and that Palestinians in Gaza would “not accept a leadership that comes on the back of a Zionist or American tank or under the protection of this tank.” He reiterated the group’s denial of a claim made by a spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on Wednesday that the Oct. 7 attack was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas. Hamdan said the Oct. 7 attack was “a Palestinian operation in planning, preparation, decision and implementation” and was launched as the “result of international collusion that tried to dispose of the Palestinian cause” in response to Israeli aggression. KIBBUTZ ANNOUNCES DEATH OF AMERICAN-CANADIAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE TEL AVIV, Israel -- A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The death of Judith Weinstein was announced days after her husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein had also been killed on Oct. 7 and her body was also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined her death. The couple are survived by four children. \"Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,\" the family said in a statement. She will be remembered for her compassion, her peaceful nature, and the creative life she built with her husband.\" According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on Oct. 7, with roughly one quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved-ones. Netanyahu met Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were ongoing behind-the-scene efforts to bring them home, according to a statement from his office. \"I can't elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,\" he said. UN PEACEKEEPER INJURED IN LEBANON BEIRUT -- A United Nations peacekeeper was injured when a group of young men attacked a patrol in south Lebanon, the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL reported Thursday. A vehicle was also damaged during the Wednesday night attack in the village of Taybeh, the force said. Such attacks \"are not only condemnable, but they are violations of Resolution 1701 and Lebanese law,\" UNIFIL said on X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to a UN Security Council resolution that ended a monthlong 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. In a separate incident Thursday morning, residents blocked a group of peacekeepers that was traveling through the border village of Kfar Kila, UNIFIL spokeswoman Kandice Ardie said. The peacekeepers were able to move on \"after a brief discussion with locals,\" Ardie said. Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon frequently accuse the UN mission of colluding with Israel, while Israel has accused the peacekeepers of turning a blind eye to Hezbollah's military activities in southern Lebanon. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah and allied groups have clashed almost daily with Israeli forces on the Lebanon-Israel border, and shelling has struck UNIFIL facilities. The peacekeeping force said gunfire from Israeli troops hit one of its patrols last month, causing no injuries but damaging a vehicle. HEAD OF IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD VOWS REVENGE FOR GENERAL'S DEATH TEHRAN, Iran -- Thousands of people attended a funeral in Iran for a high-ranking general killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike in Syria. Mourners gathered in a central square in Tehran on Thursday before accompanying the casket of Gen. Seyed Razi Mousavi to a shrine where he was buried. Mousavi was a high-ranking general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard who had served as a longtime military advisor to the Syrian government during that country's ongoing civil war. He was killed in an airstrike in Damascus on Monday. The head of the Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, said \"our revenge will be tough, as always,\" but that the only fitting revenge would be \"the removal of Israel from the face of existence.\" Salami described Mousavi as a close companion of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020. Earlier Thursday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, prayed before Mousavi's casket, state TV footage showed. Iran and Israel have waged a long shadow war, with Israel regularly carrying out strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria. Tensions have soared since Hamas' Oct, 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel views Iran as its greatest threat because of Tehran's disputed nuclear program and its support for regional militant groups like Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. ISRAEL ARRESTS 21 PALESTINIANS ACCUSED OF HELPING FINANCE HAMAS TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Israeli military says forces carried out an operation across multiple areas of the West Bank and arrested 21 Palestinians alleged to have helped finance Hamas. In a statement Thursday, the military alleged the suspects were financial services providers who allegedly funded Hamas through digital currency and cash. Israeli media said those arrested worked as foreign exchange brokers. The military said it confiscated tens of millions in Israeli currency as well as safes, documents and cell phones. Video released by the military showed troops raiding establishments overnight, at one point drilling through a wall that appeared to have been stuffed with cash. One suspect, blindfolded and hands bound by zip ties, was seen getting escorted from a military vehicle. During the operation, the military says its aircraft struck militants in Jenin who fired on troops. Forces also opened fire on Palestinians whom the military said were throwing firebombs at troops in numerous areas across the West Bank. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces in the central city of Ramallah. It did not disclose the circumstances. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, the Palestinian Health Ministry says, mostly in confrontations with Israeli forces during raids and protests. Israel has also arrested more than 2,500 people in the West Bank during that time. UNITED NATIONS OFFICE CITES OBSTACLES TO GAZA AID DELIVERIES UNITED NATIONS -- The UN humanitarian office says the scale and intensity of ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in most areas of Gaza and their devastating impact is impeding aid deliveries. The office, known as OCHA, cited blocked roads, a scarcity of fuel and telecommunications blackouts as some of the obstacles hampering the humanitarian response. Despite the challenges, OCHA said the UN World Food Program reached about a half-million people internally displaced in UN shelters south of Wadi Gaza with food parcels, wheat flour, high-energy biscuits and nutrition supplements between Dec. 23 and Dec. 26. The World Food Program, through its partners, is also helping thousands of people outside UN shelters at distribution points and community kitchens, OCHA said. The UN humanitarian agency said it is also working to deliver 50 tons of wheat flour to more than a dozen bakeries in Gaza. ISRAELI OFFICIAL SAYS MILITANT LEADER IN LEBANON COULD BE TARGETED JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign minister says the head of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group could be Israel's next target. Eli Cohen spoke a day after a Hezbollah strike wounded 11 people in northern Israel. The Iranian-backed group has fired missiles and rockets into Israel throughout the two-and-a-half month war between Israel and Hamas. Israel has responded dozens of airstrikes and artillery barrages. The daily battles have forced tens of thousands of Israelis to evacuate their homes from border communities and raised fears that they could escalate into a region-wide war. Touring Israel's border with foreign ambassadors. Cohen said Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, \"must understand that he's next.\" He said Hezbollah must respect a 2006 UN ceasefire that calls on the group to withdraw from the border area. \"We will operate to make the most of the diplomatic option,\" Cohen said. \"If it doesn't work, all options are on the table.\" [Shopping Trends](https://www.ctvnews.ca/shopping.html) The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "title": "Crisis laboral de Pemex en Campeche: ¿Qué ocurre con los más de 8 mil trabajadores desempleados? - PorEsto",
    "text": "En Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche, más de 8 mil trabajadores han perdido sus empleos debido a la falta de pago de Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) a sus proveedores. Esta situación ha generado una crisis laboral en la región, afectando principalmente a empleados de empresas relacionadas directa o indirectamente con la industria petrolera.\nNoticia Destacada\nMás de 8mil trabajadores fueron despedidos en Ciudad del Carmen por deudas de Pemex\nDe acuerdo con Guillermo Rosas Corcuera, titular del Servicio Estatal de Empleo en Campeche, las compañías proveedoras comenzaron a despedir personal desde finales de 2024, cuando los pagos de PEMEX se retrasaron significativamente. Hasta el momento, no se ha informado sobre indemnizaciones o liquidaciones específicas para los trabajadores afectados, lo que ha generado incertidumbre entre las familias que dependían de estos ingresos.\nAnte esta situación, las autoridades locales han implementado medidas para mitigar el impacto económico. Se han organizado ferias de empleo y módulos itinerantes para promover vacantes en sectores como el turismo, servicios de salud, educación y restaurantes. Sin embargo, estas opciones no han logrado cubrir la demanda de empleo, especialmente para quienes tienen experiencia en el sector petrolero, donde las oportunidades son limitadas.\nPor su parte, la Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico (SEDECO) ha planteado la necesidad de diversificar la economía del estado para reducir la dependencia de PEMEX. Aunque se han anunciado planes para fortalecer otros sectores, los resultados aún son inciertos, y muchos trabajadores continúan enfrentando dificultades para encontrar empleo estable.\nLa falta de pagos de PEMEX no solo ha afectado a los trabajadores, sino también a las empresas proveedoras, que han visto comprometida su capacidad operativa. Mientras tanto, los afectados esperan que las autoridades y la paraestatal cumplan con los compromisos pendientes para aliviar la crisis económica en la región.\nEste caso refleja la urgencia de implementar estrategias económicas sostenibles que garanticen la estabilidad laboral y reduzcan la dependencia de una sola industria. ¿Qué opinas de esta situación?",

    "text": "The Dubuque man who died from a self inflicted gunshot wound as police were prepared to serve an arrest warrant for sexual abuse was a middle school teacher who allegedly took advantage of a 14-year-old. Dubuque Police say the body of Trent Paschal, a Thomas Jefferson Middle School teacher, was found in his home shortly after officers heard a gun go off Wednesday. An arrest warrant was issued for Paschal after Dubuque school resource officers conducted an investigation over the relationship with the student. Police say the two, \"exchanged text messages and SnapChats of a sexual nature,\" and that Paschal picked the student up twice from the student's neighborhood, \"then gone back to his residence where the two engaged in sex acts.\" Traffic camera video on May 27 shows him picking the student up before midnight and driving to his apartment. The Dubuque Police Department strongly encourages any victims of sexual abuse to file a report with your local law enforcement agency. Anyone with information related to this investigation should contact Investigator Kurt Rosenthal at 563-587-3808 or krosenth@cityofdubuque.org.",
