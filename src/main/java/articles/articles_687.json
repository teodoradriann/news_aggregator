    "text": "Who knew Swiss chard could be this good?! The key is to slice the chard very thinly and cook it over medium-high heat until it caramelizes on the edges. These greens are not soggy or mushy, no way.\nThis cooked chard is a little garlicky, a little lemony, and seriously irresistible. It’s the perfect quick and healthy side dish. The chard shrinks in volume while it cooks, so you’ll find yourself eating more greens than you realize—your body will thank you!\nI love that this recipe uses leaves and stems, which are often discarded. It’s a great way to produce less waste and get more bang for your buck. Thanks to the stems, the final dish is more textural, colorful, and interesting to eat.\nIf you ever find kale to taste too bold, try mellow, earthy Swiss chard instead. Ancient Romans enjoyed Swiss chard and I’m just now falling in love with it, thanks to this quick side dish. I’m even feeling inspired to plant Swiss chard in our garden. Try it, and let me know what you think!\nHow to Cook the Best Swiss Chard You’ll find the full recipe below, but here are the keys to cooking truly irresistible Swiss chard.\nSeparate the ribs from the greens and thinly slice them both. The trick to slicing the leaves is to stack and roll them into a cigar-like shape before slicing—see my photos and the video below for visuals. The stems are tougher than the leaves, so we’ll cook the stems first. Cook over medium-high heat to achieve a lovely, light char. Add the olive oil and wait until it shimmers before adding the stems and salt. Cook until a fork easily pierces through the stems. Then, add the greens and stir every 30 seconds until they are wilted, dark green, and turning brown on the edges. Don’t stir too often because those caramelized edges are so tasty! Add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir, stir, stir. We’re adding the garlic late in the game so it doesn’t burn. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and additional salt if needed. The lemon juice adds an essential touch of brightness to these cooked greens. Watch How to Cook Swiss Chard Swiss Chard Selection & Storage Tips Any variety of Swiss chard will work well for this recipe, but the red-stemmed or rainbow-stemmed varieties yield more visually appealing results. The pops of color from the stems are so pretty!\nLook for chard leaves that are solid green with thick, healthy stems. Yellowing around the edges of the leaves and splayed stems indicate that the chard is growing old and losing flavor.\nSwiss chard is a hardy green that will keep for up to 10 days when stored properly. When you bring Swiss chard home from the store, remove the twist-tie around the base and ensure the produce bag is open rather than tied shut to prevent rot. Store the chard in the vegetable drawer on top of the other vegetables so it doesn’t get crushed.\nSwiss Chard Serving Suggestions This recipe offers a perfectly nutritious side serving of greens. Warm sautéed chard is lovely on cooler days when leafy salads are less appealing.\nThe flavors complement a variety of meals, from traditional fare like Thanksgiving supper to cheesy delights like mac and cheese .\nDon’t hesitate to serve these greens with any hearty meal that needs a burst of nutritious greens—I’d love them alongside Mexican dishes like enchiladas . You could substitute lime juice for the lemon if it better suits your meal.\nThis sautéed chard recipe stores and reheats well. Add the leftovers to your packed lunch , stir them into warm whole grains like farro or quinoa or cooked spaghetti, stuff them into quesadillas or burritos , or fold them into scrambled eggs. They’re so versatile and nutritious!\nMore Healthy Greens to Enjoy If you appreciate Swiss chard, you’ll enjoy these fresh recipes.

The key is in the method. Recipe yields 4 modest side servings. Cook another batch in another skillet if desired.\nIngredients Scale 1x 2x 3x 1 large bunch chard (about 10 ounces ) 1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil ⅛ teaspoon fine salt, to taste 2 medium cloves garlic, pressed or minced Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, scale back or omit if sensitive to spice) ½ teaspoon lemon juice plus lemon wedges, for serving Instructions To prepare the chard: Cut off the browned bits at the ends of the stems and discard them. Cut out the thick center ribs and slice across the ribs to make ¼-inch thick pieces. Keep these separate from the leaves. Stack the remaining greens and roll them up into a cigar-like shape. Slice over the “cigar” as thinly as possible (⅛″ to ¼″) to make long strands. Shake up the greens and chop across them a few times so the strands aren’t so long. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the ribs and the salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring often, until the ribs are easily pierced through by a fork, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add all of the greens to the pan. Stir until they’re lightly coated in oil, then let them cook for about 30 seconds before stirring again. Continue stirring in 30-second intervals until the greens are wilted and dark green and some are starting to turn brown on the edges (this is delicious). This will take 2 to 4 minutes. Once the chard is nearly done, add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir to break up the garlic and cook until it’s fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice. Taste and add another pinch of salt, if desired. Serve each portion with a lemon wedge. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days. Briefly warm the leftovers in the microwave before serving. Nutrition Show Nutrition Hide Nutrition The information shown is an estimate provided by an online nutrition calculator.

    "title": "Volokh Conspiracy’s Ilya Somin Smears 1924 Immigration Act—For Contemptibly Selfish Reasons",
    "text": "With\nEugene Volokh, founder of The Volokh Conspiracy seemingly fading away, the dominant voice at the website has become that of the far cruder and openly ethnocentric Ilya Somin.\nSomin is also a Russian Jewish immigrant but arriving at the age of 5 he did better expropriating the fruits of American higher education, holding degrees from Amherst, Harvard, and Yale. Volokh, although judging from his biography a much cleverer man, was confined to\n[UCLA](/posts/who-wrecked-ucla-s-medical-school-jennifer-lucero-another-woman-of-color-abusing-power).\nSomin is extremely voluble. In May alone he published 19 substantial essays on The Volokh Conspiracy.\nThese articles are comically predictable. A fanatical Open Borders man, he never exhibits any empathy for the great mass of his fellow Americans. He is strongly influenced by the interests of owners of capital.\nI have been brooding about this classic example since it was posted:\nThe ”Migrant Crisis” is Caused by Flawed Work and Housing Policies, not Migrants [by Ilya Somin, The Volokh Conspiracy, February 20, 2024].\nThis piece is an absolute master class in Missing the Point, an Open Borders Brigade specialty:— Some Random Conservatarian (@violacesario_)\n [pic.twitter.com/jjBtK7biAa] [February 22, 2024]\nSomin asserts:\nI discussed this phenomenon in\n[Queens Landlord Enriched By Biden Immivasion—Neighborhood Destroyed](/posts/queens-landlord-enriched-by-biden-immivasion-neighborhood-destroyed) and [NY Real Estate Owners Pigging Out On Great Replacement Funding](/posts/ny-real-estate-owners-pigging-out-on-great-replacement-funding)\nIlya Somin is impervious to anyone’s interests but his own.\nNow Somin has had the insolence to post\nThe 100th Anniversary of One of America’s Worst Laws—the 1924 Immigration Act [The Volokh Conspiracy, June 3, 2024].\nBluntly, his claims are crazy:\nPost‐1924 Americans are not free to associate, contract, and trade with people born around the world as they were before.\nThis is a ridiculous statement.\nJust as silly:\n…the Act also did great harm to native-born Americans by depriving them of the economic growth, productivity, and innovation that immigration produces, and reducing America’s power and influence in the world.\nOh yeah? No doubt this was why, 21 years later, America was unable to defeat Germany and Japan in separate titanic global wars, and save the USSR from the consequences of Stalin’s diplomatic outwitting by Hitler and the damage done by his\nslaughter of his officer corps.\nSomin burbles on:\nIf the United States had granted legal permanent residence at the same per‐capita rate that it did from 1900–1914—before World War I disrupted travel—another 164 million immigrants would have been permitted to settle in the United States legally.\nWhile it not quite clear what period Somin has in mind the population of the U.S. in 1965, when the nation-breaking reversal of policy of that year, was engineered, was 195 million. So if Somin had had his way this would have been 84% higher.\nA population expansion of this size driven by the introduction of aliens obviously raises the danger I discussed late last year in\n[Chinese Problems + No Borders = American Obliteration](/articles/chinese-problems-no-borders-american-obliteration-watch-muckraker-com-s-great-videos). Would America still be America?\nApparently this is not a question Somin cares about.\nNot that he rejects ethnic considerations altogether:\nThe most obvious harm caused by the 1924 Immigration Act was consigning many millions of would-be immigrants to a lifetime of poverty and oppression in their countries of origin. The most notorious example is that of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, such as\n[Anne Frank and her family].\nThere is definitely a school of thought that\n[the 1924 Act](/articles/john-derbyshire-it-s-100-years-since-calvin-coolidge-who-signed-the-1924-immigration-cutoff-into-law-was-sworn-in-as-president) was wrong because it did not subordinate American immigration policy to the convenience of German Jews.\nIn one of his first essays for us,\n[Was the 1924 Immigration Cut-off ”Racist”?](/articles/was-the-1924-immigration-cut-off-racist), Professor [ Kevin MacDonald](/writers/kevin-macdonald) considered the torrent of abuse to which the Act has been subjected:\nBut were the 1920s restrictions “racist-driven”? What, exactly does that mean? And could it be that the opponents of those restrictions had their own ethnic motivations? Motivations still to be found today?\nMacDonald pointed out that the Congressional colloquies were full of admissions by the measure’s supporters acknowledging that recent immigrants were superior in various ways to the native-born, but that they did not accept it gave the newcomers the right to transform America. Thus Congressman\nWilliam N. Vaile of Colorado:\nWhat we do claim is that the northern European and particularly\n[Anglo-Saxons]made this country. Oh, yes; the others helped. But… [t]hey came to this country because it was already made as an Anglo-Saxon commonwealth. They… [did not make it], and they have not yet greatly changed it.\nWe are determined that they shall not … It is a good country. It suits us … If there is any changing to be done, we will do it ourselves.\nThis perfectly reasonable point of view is anathema to open-borders types like Ilya Somin.\nWhy?\nLater, in 2014, Professor MacDonald explored this for us in\n[Is Immigration Really A ”Jewish Value”?](/articles/is-immigration-really-a-jewish-value) At the time a tremendous effort was underway in Congress for amnesty and immigration acceleration, with the energetic support of most Jewish groups. Also at the time, Israel was wrapping up its successful effort to prevent an inundation by black Africans crossing the Suez peninsula.\nWe had a series celebrating this:\n[Netanyahu For President! (4)](Netanyahu%20For%20President!%20(4))\nProfessor MacDonald was curious about this extreme paradox. He concluded:\nThe way I see it is that overtly nationalist ethics are\n[alive and well]in Israel, as it [rids itself of African migrants]and systematically oppresses the Palestinians via ethnic cleansing and apartheid, while in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Western Diaspora the organized Jewish community and most Jewish intellectuals pose as enlightened universalists…\nDiaspora Jewish groups in the West see themselves\n[as benefiting]from displacement-level immigration because it [lessens the power]of the White majority.\nIn fact, the motive may be more specific in some cases, as I noted in\n[The Lesson Of WHITE RURAL RAGE: They Hate Us. They Will Always Hate Us.](/posts/the-lesson-of-white-rural-rage-they-hate-us-they-will-always-hate-us)\nBut I agree with Kevin MacDonald’s conclusion:\nWestern peoples… can only begin to defend their legitimate interests when they challenge\n[the hypocrisy], and historical inaccuracy, of Jewish immigration enthusiast claims to a unique, and imperative, moral vision.\nComplain to Ilya Somin via\n[email ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1c756f737175725c7b716932797869)or",

    "text": "Canada will reach the benchmark that requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military by 2032, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said. Speaking at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Mr Trudeau also hit back at those using a \"crude mathematical calculation\" to criticise an ally that \"continually punches above its weight\". As the military alliance marks its 75th anniversary, pressure has been mounting for members to meet the spending target set out by its doctrine.\nCanada currently spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military. The Nato founding member places seventh overall among 32 nations in the amount of money it spends on defence. But using the 2% metric, America's northern neighbour is ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the 32-member alliance. By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%.\nFrustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators, who urged the country to immediately develop a plan to increase its spending. Some US lawmakers have more bluntly criticised Canada over its Nato benchmark shortfall. “They have the safety and security of being on our border and not having to worry about that. I think that’s shameful,\" Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week. \"I think if you’re going to be a member nation and participant, you need to do your part.”",

    "title": "Minnesota State Patrol Trooper Ryan Londregan charged with murder in July shooting of Ricky Cobb II during traffic stop - ABC7 New York",
    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- A Minnesota state trooper was charged with murder Wednesday in the shooting of motorist Ricky Cobb II, who failed to get out of his car during a July traffic stop and took his foot off the brake when officers tried to arrest him. In announcing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said Trooper Ryan Londregan's use of deadly force against Cobb, a 33-year-old Black man, was not justified. \"As with all Minnesota law enforcement officers, state troopers may only use deadly force when it is necessary to protect a person from a specific identified threat of great bodily harm or death that was reasonably likely to occur. That did not exist in this case,\" Moriarty said. Londregan's attorney Chris Madel called his client \"a hero,\" saying Londregan, 27, was trying to protect himself and a fellow trooper. Madel filed papers seeking to have the case dismissed or at least to have Moriarty removed from the case. \"This county attorney is literally out of control. Open season on law enforcement must end. And it's going to end with this case,\" Madel said in a video statement. Londregan has not been arrested. Moriarty said her office will not seek to hold him on bail but will ask the court to require him to surrender his passport and firearms. She expected his first court appearance to be scheduled for later this week or early next week. RELATED | Bodycam video released of Minnesota State Patrol fatal traffic stop shooting The July 31 shooting occurred in Minneapolis, where the murder of George Floyd by police nearly four years ago spurred sometimes violent protests and a nationwide reckoning on racial justice. In that case, Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years for second-degree murder. The shooting has some similarities to the 2022 death of motorist Daunte Wright, who was trying to drive away from a traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center when Officer Kim Potter shot him. Potter said she meant to use her Taser but accidentally grabbed her gun. She served about 16 months of a two-year sentence for second-degree manslaughter. Londregan shot Cobb after two other troopers pulled him over on Interstate 94 in Minneapolis when he saw the lights were out on the Ford Fusion that Cobb was driving, according to the criminal complaint. One of the troopers, Brett Seide, checked Cobb's record and found he was wanted for violating an order for protection in neighboring Ramsey County. There was no outstanding arrest warrant, however, so the troopers checked with Ramsey County officials to find out if they wanted Cobb taken into custody, the complaint said. Ramsey County asked that he be arrested. By then, Londregan had arrived. Seide approached the driver's side of Cobb's car while Londregan went to the passenger door, according to the complaint. The troopers asked Cobb to get out of the car, whose doors were locked and front windows down. Seide told Cobb he was under arrest while Londregan reached inside, unlocked the doors and began opening the passenger door. The complaint said Cobb then shifted the car into drive and took his foot off the brake. According to the complaint, Cobb's car began to slowly move forward. Londregan reached for his gun. Cobb stopped the car. The trooper pointed his gun at Cobb and yelled, \"Get out of the car now!\" Cobb took his foot off the brake again. Within less than a second, Londregan fired his handgun twice at Cobb, striking him both times in the chest, the complaint said. The car accelerated forward while Seide's torso was still inside. Seide and Londregan tried to keep up with the car for several feet before falling. The car collided with a concrete median about a quarter mile (400 meters) away. The troopers caught up, pulled Cobb out and attempted lifesaving measures. Cobb was pronounced dead at the scene. The defense filing quotes written statements to investigators by Seide and Trooper Garrett Erickson that they believed lethal force was necessary. \"At that time, I knew that Trooper Londregan and I were in danger of being run over by Cobb's car, being hit by an oncoming car on the highway, or otherwise being dragged away at a high rate of speed,\" Seide said. According to the complaint, State Patrol policy states that troopers shall not fire at a moving vehicle except when deadly force is authorized, and that troopers should not put themselves in a position that increases the risk that a vehicle that they're approaching can be used as a deadly weapon. The chief of the State Patrol, Col. Matt Langer, said in a statement that Londergan will remain on paid leave during an ongoing internal affairs investigation. \"This is a sad situation for everyone involved,\" Langer said. \"We acknowledge the deep loss felt by Mr. Cobb's family and friends. We also recognize the gravity of this situation for the State Patrol and our troopers tasked with making difficult split-second decisions.\" Cobb's family and racial justice groups demanded in August that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz fire all three troopers. His mother, Nyra Fields-Miller, and the family's attorneys said the charges put law enforcement on notice that those who disregard the law will be held accountable. \"Ryan Londregan stole my son from me,\" Fields-Miller said in a statement. \"He gunned Ricky down my son for no reason while he was defenseless. Nothing can ever make up for that. But today's decision is the first step toward closure and justice.\" The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association accused Moriarty of making a political decision to charge Londregan, noting that she ran on a platform that was critical of policing, and said law enforcement officers elsewhere have been dragged to death during lawful traffic stops. \"The resounding message that I get from rank and file all around the state is that there is a fear, a significant fear, especially in the last three years - and this has really solidified and provided an exclamation point - that you can go to prison just for doing your job,\" Imran Ali, the association's general counsel, said in an interview.",

    "text": "我要飞得更高，飞得更高；\n狂风一样舞蹈，挣脱怀抱；\n我要飞得更高，飞得更高。\n没有人会想到，在2025年只需要299元，就能让 汪峰 “手把手”教自己唱歌。\n音乐人汪峰再成焦点\n据媒体报道，近日知名音乐人汪峰再次成为了网友们关注的目标。\n不过这次让他被大家讨论的原因，并不是那个“热搜又被抢了”的经典老梗，而是汪峰做出了跨界卖课的决定。\n在售价及内容层面。\n299元的 音乐课 程包不仅内含30节汪峰录播课，还有3节音乐课老师直播课。其内容，更是涵盖了音乐历史、基础乐理、词曲创作等多个模块，使用户的观感和“音乐不是一件高门槛的事情”“流行歌曲演唱没有那么难”等Solgan高度相符。\n据汪峰本人在直播间里透露。\n整套音乐课程，不仅承载着近百人团队超三个月的通力合作，还饱含着他的演唱、创作心得。\n与之相应的，网课的发售方“未来音乐学院”也在宣传途中表示，在30天学习期结束后，相关工作人员会组织学员进行统一考核，以此来选拔出汪峰的“赛博得意门生”，让对方参与到汪峰后续的线下活动、音乐表演里。\n将指针拨到7月5日，这天汪峰在直播间里试水了一次带货行动，使自己的音乐课销量快速突破了5600套大关。倘若按照单套售价299元来计算，那么汪峰在7月5日这天的音乐课销售额也将接近160万。\n但值得注意的是。\n7月19日，记者发现上述音乐课在“未来音乐学院”的店铺总销量仅为718套。可见现阶段课程的主要销量仍需依托汪峰的粉丝号召力、个人影响力。其下一轮销量波峰，也大有可能会随着汪峰的直播档期而出现。\n盯上知识付费的明星还有谁\n事实上，汪峰并不是第一个想到吃“知识螃蟹”的艺人。\n早在他录制网课之前，张韶涵、王力宏等明星就已经推出了自己的付费内容。就连 吴彦祖 本人，也曾因为“英语教学”一事而成为网友们争相讨论的目标。\n在5月21日这天，吴彦祖曾在“吴彦祖教英语”直播间里下场带货，并在短短一个半小时内售出了近3万套英语口语教程，首播便取得了“总销售额破千万”的瞩目成绩。\n据媒体报道，吴彦祖教学英语一事可追溯到2025年初，彼时的他不仅在小红书、抖音上开通了个人账号，还结合个人经历向网友们逐步分享了咖啡馆点餐、超市购物等常见语境的英文教程。\n事后，受益于吴彦祖本人的强大影响力。\n相关团队制作的“吴彦祖带你学口语”“吴彦祖带你学英语：90天变身流利口语达人”课程包也迅速走红网络，吸引了大量粉丝慕名购买。\n只可惜，随着时间的推迟，网友们很快就发现售课方主打的“Daniel亲自陪练”实为AI声线模拟，且课程包里吴彦祖的出场部分也多为提前录播（单课出场时间约为5分钟），剩下的课时则由其余英语讲师负责。\n而这种略显“反差”的购物体验，也让部分吴彦祖粉丝在网上发出了失望的吐槽声。\n但不可否认的是，吴彦祖的下场的确为产品甚至品牌建立了差异化标签，使其在同质化竞争严重的英语教学市场爆火出圈，为我们直观展示了明星效应+知识付费的“奇妙反应”。\n明星 副业 迎来3.0版本\n当我们把注意力从汪峰、吴彦祖的身上暂时挪开，转身把它放在“明星副业”这个概念上的时候。\n我们就会发现，现阶段的明星、艺人们，已经悄然进入了副业经济的3.0版本。\n在2015年左右（甚至更早的时间节点），明星们布局副业的方式往往会依托“实体经济”。这个阶段，大家的主流选择通常是创立奶茶、火锅品牌，或是根据个人审美打造服饰潮牌，以此吸引加盟商加盟、粉丝消费。\n该阶段也被称之为明星副业的1.0版本，即依托个人影响力赋能成熟商业模型。\n随着短视频、直播平台的快速成熟，明星副业也很快迎来了2.0版本。这时的艺人明显意识到了互联网的力量，他们不仅会倾尽全力维护自己的账号，还会出现直播间里同粉丝亲密接触并下场带货。\n划重点，明星直播带货的底层驱动力是“个人魅力”。可一旦选品出现问题，那么他们的粉丝认知也将出现裂痕。这种由高风险、高精力投入带来的高收益，也在一定程度上劝退了部分想分得一杯“带货羹”的艺人。\n在这样的背景下，以个人特长、爱好为主的明星副业3.0版本也应运而生。\n就像 周杰伦 卖奶茶、汪峰教音乐一样，无论是实体经济、还是数字产业，3.0副业模型都能让他们强化自己的个人标签，进而凭借“梗文化”“专业性”等概念吸引围观者消费。\n从影响上看。\n第三代明星副业模型，不仅能大幅拉近艺人和粉丝、非粉丝群体的距离，还为他们保留了拥抱实体、线上经济的灵活性。更别说在自己擅长的领域进行副业切入，能够帮艺人节省大量风险评估、可行性调研的精力。\n正因于此，我们也大胆猜测在2025年里，汪峰绝不是最后一个拥抱“副业3.0”的明星。而他大胆下场卖课的行为，也将成为其他布局副业的艺人灵感来源。\n参考 ：\n新京报官微：吴彦祖的英语课，正在变为一场“沉浸式追星”\n21世纪经济报道：“10分钟只有5分钟是他讲”！吴彦祖英语课遭吐槽，课程5天已卖500万元，最新回应\n红星新闻：明星纷纷跨界卖课，汪峰推299元音乐课引热议\n潇湘晨报：汪峰也来跨界卖课，推出299元音乐课，仅售出718套",

    "text": "‘Mi país me falló’: Eduardo Polonsky, ganadero sobreviviente de ataques de Hamás Judío argentino, quien se ha negado a irse del Kibutz Or HaNer, revive el día de los ataques, y expresa su sentir sobre la tardanza para recibir ayuda tras la tragedia Cuarta parte. – A pesar de que la mayoría de los habitantes del Kibutz Or HaNer en el sur de Israel, fueron evacuados tras los ataques de Hamás el 7 de octubre, Eduardo Polonsky, un ganadero judío-argentino se ha negado a salírse; y dos meses después de la tragedia, no oculta su decepción con quienes gobiernan Israel. Toda su familia se ha ido y lo ha dejado en Or HaNer. El hombre rechaza abandonar su hogar, las siembras y sus vacas. “Yo soy un agricultor, un ganadero. No soy un superhéroe. Amo la vida. Lo más arriesgado que hago es andar en moto. Aunque soy parte de la reserva del ejército, mi estilo no es andar con un arma larga”. El segundo día después de los ataques de Hamas a la frontera sur de Israel, el 8 de octubre, el ejército israelí dio la orden de evacuar el lugar. Alrededor de 500 personas fueron evacuadas de los kibutz del sur del país, y de algunas comunidades del norte. La mayoría fueron llevados a hoteles. “La gente que trabajamos en la producción de leche, nos quedamos. No se puede parar. Nosotros seguimos creando vida”. El pintoresco Kibutz Or HaNer, localizado a dos kilómetros y medio de la Franja de Gaza se salvó de ser atacado, gracias a que la unidad de respuesta rápida se enfrentó con alrededor de 40 terroristas en el Kibutz Erez lo que impidió que llegaran a Or HaNer. “La noche del 6 de octubre salimos a cenar con mi esposa con quien estoy casado desde hace 23 años, y con mis hijos. La pasamos muy bien. Nos fuimos a dormir a las tres de la mañana, a las 6:30 de la mañana sonó la alarma. Mi señora me arrastró hacia el bunker, la habitación de seguridad de la casa”. Desde ahí, podían escuchar las explosiones de los proyectiles. “Al volver a la cama, le comenté a mi señora que escuchaba tiros de metralleta y armas automáticas, y no era normal. Cuando nos levantamos, mi hijo mayor de 40 años, es parte del equipo de primera respuesta del kibutz, me dijo que había una situación especial, no sabíamos qué pasaba”. A los 10 minutos les avisaron por la radio que el kibutz Erez de al lado había sido invadido por Hamás; y un miembro del equipo de primera respuesta, había muerto y tenían dos heridos. “No tenían posibilidad de detener la ofensiva, y sabíamos que si la pasaban, venían para acá. El comandante nuestro de primera respuesta, mandó cuatro miembros para tratar de frenar la ofensiva y felizmente pudieron pararla. Hubo mucha suerte”. Lo más duro – recuerda Eduardo – fue el asesinato del intendente a causa de proyectil que lanzaron a su casa para reventarla. “Yo me había ofrecido para ayudarle, pero no me contestó cuando le llamé. A los siete minutos, un periodista me preguntó si era cierto que lo habían matado. Averigüe que sí”. La tardanza Casi dos meses después de la tragedia, Eduardo cuenta que sinceramente no se acuerda de lo que pasó el 7 de octubre. “En mi memoria está lo que me contó mi esposa”. Lo que sí tiene claro y lamenta es la lentitud del ejército para defenderlos. “Pasaron cerca de 16, 17 horas para ver en el kibutz a los primeros miembros del ejército que teóricamente tendrían que habernos defendido. Hasta el 7 de octubre se contaban en el mundo, las proezas y la grandeza del ejército israelí, desde ese sábado no puedo dar la misma respuesta. “Desde ese sábado me es muy difícil creer en quienes teóricamente tendrían que darnos seguridad. Hoy en día, la pregunta sigue siendo qué pasó; y solo hay dos opciones: alguien no quiso estar aquí; o fue la arrogancia del ejército”. Solo contaron para su protección con el grupo de defensa del Kibutz que son todos civiles. “No hay ningún miembro de estos grupos que sean militares o tengan un entrenamiento especial, el que tiene una idea de son superhéroes, esos no somos nosotros”. ‘Mi país me fallo’ Eduardo hace eco del sentimiento de muchos israelíes, dice que se siente decepcionado con Israel. “Mi país me falló. Mi forma de vida y mis pensamientos se convirtieron en una fábula y en una estupidez”. Aclara que no está decepcionado de los soldados, a quienes llama chicos jóvenes excepcionales, sino de quienes representan y dirigen el país. “A los políticos como a los pañales, hay que cambiarlos cada tanto porque están llenos de mierda”. Una encuesta revelada este mes del Instituto Lazar reveló que la popularidad del primer ministro Benjamín Netanyahu continúa cayendo, apenas el 31% aprueba su trabajo en medio de la guerra Israel-Hamas. Eduardo dice que tiene muchos amigos en Gaza y guarda sus teléfonos, pero no les puede llamar porque aquellos que trabajaban en los kibutzim, entraron junto con los soldados de Hamás a matarlos, robarlos y violar a las mujeres. “Hay una llamada por teléfono en la que se escucha a uno de los terroristas avisar a su familia que ya mató a 12 judíos con sus propias manos, y en la que dice que es un héroe”. La guerra no es la solución Eduardo dice que está consciente de que la guerra no soluciona nada. “No se puede matar hasta el último de los soldados del Hamás que luchan por ideales erróneos y distintos a los nuestros. Esto tiene que terminar de otra forma. La guerra tiene que crear pautas para que alguien en el mundo se dé cuenta que esto tiene que tener una intervención distinta. “Alguien del mundo se tiene que dar cuenta que no hay buenos y malos, que acá hay un pueblo que necesita ayuda para ser liberado, estoy hablando del pueblo de Gaza, un pueblo que por sus propios medios no se va a poder liberar”. ¿Vuelta a la normalidad? El agricultor y ganadero dice que tras los ataques de Hamás, no puede darse la libertad de recibir a sus nietos ni de comer un asado con su familia en su casa. A solas en su vivienda afirma: “no sé cuándo lo voy a poder hacer. No sé cuándo se sientan seguros de volver a esta zona”. A seis días de los ataques de Hamás, nació Rommy, la octava nieta de Eduardo. “Apenas la he visto dos veces”. En guerra y bajos misiles, dice que está tratando de volver a la normalidad. “Entre los estruendos que nosotros mandamos y los que ellos mandan, busco algún tipo de normalidad; y en eso, un día me encontré yo solo haciendo asado, y el olor del asado me recuerda a la normalidad”. Y tras una breve reflexión, externa que la ideología de todos los israelíes es no dejarse vencer. “Si nos vencen, nos matan”. Los kibbutzim Eduardo dice que un kibutz en la actualidad, es como un barrio cerrado, con la diferencia de que además de las casas, tienen empresas y la economía es comunitaria, no comunista. “Nosotros nos repartimos las ganancias por igual. Aunque cada uno recibe su sueldo de acuerdo a lo que trabaja”. En el Kibutz Or Haner se producen cuatro millones de litros de leche por año. Tienen una planta seleccionadora de zanahorias, y producen el 70% de las zanahorias que se consumen en el país, además de que exportan a Rusia. “Sembramos trigo, cebada, algodón, y contamos con un criadero de pollos de engorda. Tenemos el restaurante Patagonia que prepara 4,700 raciones de comida por día para su venta fuera; y somos dueños de una fábrica de remaches inteligentes para fabrica pesada, que venden el 95% al exterior”. Antes de los ataques de Hamás, vivían cerca de 900 personas en el Kibutz Or HaNer. Eduardo dice que la agricultura en Israel es trabajada por tailandeses que llegan al país con un contrato de trabajo por cinco años. “Cerca de 40 tailandeses fueron asesinados el mismo sábado 7 de octubre. Ellos pensaron que el pasaporte los iba a salvar de este desastre; y a los que no mataron durmiendo, se los llevaron como prisioneros”. *Esta serie de reportajes es posible gracias a una fellowship de Fuente Latina, una organización no lucrativa y no partidista, fundada y dirigida por Leah Soibel.

    "text": "War produces ideas, innovation and technological development. Hi-tech people are here to stay, and investments are yet to come. Dr. Avi Hasson, founder of the Israel Innovation Authority and currently CEO at Startup Nation Central, is behind a report that is surprisingly optimistic about the future of Israeli high-tech. In an interview, he explains why he abandons his pessimistic predictions. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok >> Read more: Israeli cyber experts warn that Israel is not ready for a cyber Oct. 7 Israel is unprepared for a cyber strike like the October 7 massacre US imposes sanctions on former senior IDF officer over spyware sales to dictators At the end of September, after a difficult year for Israeli high-tech due to global slowdown and judicial reform - \\\"Startup Nation Central\\\" (SNC), located in a fancy designed building on Lilinblum Street in Tel Aviv, began to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Foreign and local company managers came in and out of their doorstep at a record pace Everything was hectic - discussions, meetings, senior delegations arriving from abroad. Even a conference was scheduled for February in the capital of Bahrain with 1,000 participants from the Gulf countries, under the auspices of the King and in cooperation with the Bahraini Ministry of Commerce and Industry. And then October 7 happened. \\\"Everything stopped overnight,\\\" recounts Avi Hasson, CEO at SNC. \\\"The building was emptied, activities stopped, the conference was canceled. And after all the tremendous effort we put in maintaining relations with countries in the region - there was suddenly no one on the other end of the line.\\\" But today, more than 100 days since the war broke out, Hasson, former Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy, and chairman of the Israel Innovation Authority (which he founded) is optimistic. \\\"I am less worried today than I was during the judicial overhaul period,\\\" he says, \\\"because in the end, more than anything else, our most important asset is the human capital. Israel is a hub of human, entrepreneurial infrastructure, with a unique environment, making it suitable for building startups this was the first time I really feared that people would leave the country. CEOs of multinational companies told me at the time that they had never received so many applications for relocation. Now things have reversed, and this trend has fallen off the agenda: many of them, who only a few months ago prepared their foreign passports and registered their companies abroad, are today in a state of mind of 'we stay and fight, we stay and influence'. Therefore, by the way, I bet that we will soon see more and more high-tech people going into politics. \\\"There is another important element: war produces ideas and innovation. Technologies that were developed, perfected, and tested in war can be converted to, say, picking peppers. And I say: just as there is always 'baby boom' after wars, we will see a significant change here.\\\" There is a deep pocket \\\"Startup Nation Central\\\" is unique and there's no such other company in the entire world: it's a free-acting NGO that runs like a high-tech company in every respect - 110 employees with a chief business officer, product managers, customer managers and a customer relations platform - which in 2022 generated an annual turnover of approximately NIS 80 million based on donations only, and its only goal is to strengthen the high-tech industry in Israel to connect between local companies with investors, companies and entrepreneurs from abroad. CEOs of the world's largest international corporations, from food giants like Nestlé to medical centers like Henry Ford in Detroit, senior officials and government representatives, make a pilgrimage to SNC, \\\"and they always ask 'so, where's the catch?' \\\", laughs Hasson. \\\"You don't get commissions from us\\\", they tell me with a wink, \\\"so you probably get one from the company you recommend, or from the government\\\". They find it hard to believe that we are a non-profit organization.\\\" Hasson, 53, has been holding this powerful position, perhaps the most influential on the status of Israeli high-tech in the world, for two years. His predecessor was Prof. Eugene Kandel, currently chairman of the Start-Up Nation Policy Institute SNPI. Hasson entered the position after serving six years as the chief scientist of the Ministry of Economy and chairman of the Israel Innovation Authority. Before that, he served as General Partner at Gemini Israel funds. He is a graduate of IDF's elite intelligence unit 8200, holds a BA in Economics and Middle Eastern Studies and an MBA. He is married, father of three and lives in Modi'in. His wife, Efrat Fink, is a judge in the Central District Court. A few weeks ago, contrary to the gloomy predictions about the high-tech industry in wake of the Gaza war, Hasson signed a relatively optimistic 2023 annual report for SNC, which, despite uncertainty and difficult year, points to first bright spots: 88% of multinationals plan to maintain or expand their presence in Israel private funding levels have shown notable resilience, comparable to that of the US funding has stabilized to 2019 levels, yet, it is actually closer to $10 billion, and signs of rebound are evident in acquisitions and mergers. SNC draws this data from a powerful tool it developed and maintains with a large investment: Startup Nation Finder - an online knowledge and networking platform that supports the development of the Israeli innovation ecosystem. It provides top-quality data and insights about the tech industry and links to key ecosystem players including 7500 startups, 500 multinationals active in Israel, investors, accelerators, and much more. \\\"Finder\\\" has over 100,000 regular users, most of them located abroad, who use it for innovation scouting, to create collaborations, and more it also serves as a reliable tool for conducting surveys in the field. How is the promise of overseas investors to maintain their presence in Israel consistent with another figure in the report, that about half of the active investors in Israel anticipate a decrease in investments in Israeli technology in 2024? Hasson: \\\"Investors sometimes confuse investments in funds with investments in startups. They really have doubts about the ability to raise continuation funds even in 2024. But this is different from the money for startups, which majority part has already been raised. The Israeli investors have deep pockets, but their money which was raised by Israeli funds in 2021 and the first half of 2022 was barely invested because they all went into the bunker. They will have no choice but to invest it. These funds will come, and the entrepreneurs will come, and we are expected, in my opinion, for a new wave of innovation and entrepreneurship.\\\" On the other hand, there may be nothing left to invest in: in the last 8 years there has been a steady decrease in the number of startups founded in Israel, and in 2023 the number of fundraisings for startups decreased by 50%. So maybe it's time to drop the title \\\"Startup Nation\\\" and focus on helping giant Israeli companies and multinational companies? \\\"First of all, every big company was once a small company. There is no way to produce five unicorns (companies valued at one billion dollars or more) without starting with 100 or more startups. In order to reach big Israeli companies, you must have a critical mass of startups. It's a kind of pyramid that you have to climb from the bottom. It always starts with academic research - where we are also in trouble - with ideas and inventions, and then it translates into startups. These, by the way, in the vast majority, are either closed or swallowed by bigger companies. \\\"By the way, in all the startups in Israel, roughly 10% of high-tech employees work. Another 20% work in international companies. That's it. So, the large majority is actually in Israeli companies that have grown, such as Check Point, ironSource, Nice, Wix and more. In the last decade we already have more than 100 like these. Even when they are acquired, they are so big and powerful that not only do they not leave Israel – but they usually bring in more investments for example, Mobileye and Mellanox, which today is part of Nvidia. \\\"There is a red line below which none of this will work, and the decrease in the number of startups is really very worrying. The phenomenon, by the way, is not unique to Israel, but here - it is critical.\\\" So why arefewer startups being opened? \\\"The innovation we see today focuses mostly on very specific areas - mobile, social networks, the Internet. In these realms the world has already reached its peak. In other words, there are indeed a lot of upgrades and updates, but there are fewer new ideas which justify establishing a new company. For example, 70% of the decrease in startups is attributed to one field - AD Tech, which many startups in Israel engaged in, until Facebook and Google took it over and all the others became redundant. The positive side is that we are now at the beginning of a new wave of innovation - technologies such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, quantum and more. We still don't see significant numbers of startups in these fields, but they are on their way. AI in itself creates endless of opportunities. \\\"And there is another reason for the decline. Many years ago, big companies, such as IBM as it once used to be, were not innovative, not fun, not very rewarding - and therefore, if you were a young person who wanted to do the hottest thing and make a good profit, you would start a startup. Today, giants like Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia are very innovative, rewarding companies, and they have an advantage over startups - they own the most significant databases and 'engines.' Obviously, you will be less eager to establish your own startup when you can work in such places, earn very nicely, and engage in innovative topics in a dynamic environment.\\\" GPS for startups SNC owes its establishment to the best-selling book by Dan Senor and Saul Singer \\\"Startup Nation\\\", published in 2009 (in these days, by the way, a sequel \\\"The Genius of Israel\\\" is published, which is no less flattering to Israel). The dramatic impact of the book was not lost on the Jewish billionaire Paul Singer, one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street, founder of the major hedge fund Elliott Management, and his partner, Terry Kassel. The two, passionate Zionists, were inspired by the book, realizing that the right way to strengthen Israel is through high-tech. As far as its founders are concerned, SNC is a kind of GPS, a road navigator that should make Startup Nation accessible to the world. As mentioned, the organization's budget is based only on donations the couple (Singer and Kassel) contribute about half of it, and over the years and due to its success, many other donors have been added. CEO Hasson and his co-workers are perfectly networked in the Israeli high-tech map: they know everything about everyone and are able to provide any investor or company with any relevant information about companies operating in Israel, in high resolutions and in almost every possible cut. Hasson: \\\"For example, I can call a meeting of the managers of the top 30 multinational companies active in Israel to get updates, and they will tell the truth. This place is considered a haven. They share with complete openness, and it is clear to everyone that what comes up in the room does not leak. It is also kind of a support group: a CEO can suddenly discover that the problem he is enduring is also shared by other managers. By the way, if you talk to each of them, you will hear that they wear two hats: they are the ambassadors of their companies in Israel, and they are the ambassadors of Israel in their companies. \\\"In general, one of the greatest assets of Israeli high-tech, which unfortunately was undermined in 2023 and I hope will now recuperate, is the deep feeling every entrepreneur here has, that he is actually selling two things - his product and the country. When I served as the chief scientist, I got the chance to meet a lot with the CEOs of the world's technology giants. I would always ask them what their strongest impression of Israel was. One of the most prominent CEOs, whose name I will not disclose, told me in amazement: \\\"'Listen, I met 13 companies here, and each one of them - apart from selling me their product, sold me Israel'. This is something that is very significant for us, even if we don't notice it. \\\"Apart from the economic aspect, we at SNC also engage with Israel's global positioning, which these days has become very significant: how do you turn something that is perceived as a problem maker, into a place that produces technology and know-how, that overcomes the challenges of humanity, such as epidemics, climate crisis and water shortages. We also created the term 'innovation diplomacy', in which we turn the tables: the startup companies are the 'product' that we utilize to forge ties with other countries. We focused mainly on countries included in the Abraham Accords and other countries in the region with which we do not have agreements.\\\" So why not settle for the website? \\\"Besides the 'Finder', which serves hundreds of thousands of people and provides initial information, there are also hundreds of investors and executives from abroad who contact us directly. We offer tailor-made 'product' packages - from a two-hour presentation on Israeli high-tech, through an in-depth study of a certain sector and a meeting with specific startups, to a three-day, and sometimes a week, of in-depth study and an open discussion about strategies and other relevant areas. There are also completely different processes, such as 'Tech Challenge', as we call it. Let's take, for example, an American hospital that is interested in early diagnosis technologies for Alzheimer's disease. We know how to lead, together with the customer, a long six-month process, which allows relevant companies in Israel to propose themselves, which can also include a judicial process to select the winners.\\\" What has changed in your work since the war broke out? \\\"Everything. If normally our 'customer' is a foreign body, from the outside in, we immediately realized that the 'customer' now is the startups at home that need urgent help, that is, from the inside out. All the companies asked for temporary funding, to allow them to survive the coming months. These are companies that lost deals, that were just planning to go on a fundraising campaign, that at least 15% of their employees are in IDF reserves duty - sometimes the founders themselves. At the same time, we received tons of requests from people all over the world offering their help. It could be also professionals, including senior consultants in large companies, who offered to work voluntarily for the sake of Israeli startups. \\\"We literally set up a service center here, which served 520 startups within a few weeks. We also helped companies to receive government support, and we built a 'pool' of foreign investors that we work with regularly - many of them contacted us on their own initiative - and we offered to provide them with information about startups that are looking for urgent financing. Most of them responded positively.\\\" Who are these people - philanthropists with a warm Jewish heart or businessmen who seizes the opportunity? \\\"The first tier really consists of Jewish investors, and in this war there were also those who suddenly discovered their Jewishness. But not only: it could also be a senior official of an investment company who wants to help Israel and simply doesn't know how. Some of them are people who have used our services over the years as we were helping them find exactly what they needed without asking something in return. So, we told them: Now it's time for you to help us. And there were also those who said to themselves, 'Precisely now Israel is becoming an interesting place to invest in.' Multinational companies also supported Israel very clearly, which was not obvious at all. The main reason in my opinion is that Israel has become very important to them today it is a strategic center for many companies. \\\"In addition, we launched an international campaign under the title 'Israeli Hi-tech delivers, no matter what'. The idea is to convey stability and preserve the image of 'the engine keeps running'. Because with all due respect to the Houthis, high-tech does not involve maritime transportation, supply chains or logistics. During the Russia-Ukraine war, many companies experienced a similar situation, they had quite large development teams in Ukraine, but there the first question that was raised was how to get them out of the country. In Israel it's the other way around: 300,000 Israelis, from anywhere in the world, simply boarded a plane and came to Israel. It seems natural to us, but for people abroad – they find it fascinating.\\\" \\\"Important government signaling\\\" Nevertheless, according to all the data, including yours, the investments in Israel are in a bad shape - about 60% drop. How does this correlate with the cautious optimism emerging from your survey? \\\"This is not contradictory. On the one hand, people are really concerned. On the other hand, there is a great deal of trust in the resilience of Israeli high-tech. Most of the decline we experienced in 2023 is a global phenomenon, experienced in each of the high-tech centers in the world. In Israel, the decline was more significant, and we attribute it to the 'judicial reform' and the Gaza war. So, we dropped to 2019 figures, and we are talking about investments of 'only' two billion dollars per Quarter in 2023, but we weep over it because we remember the large sums of 2021. But two billion dollars per quarter is still a lot of money, also in international terms. \\\"Besides, in Israel things always happen two quarters after Silicon Valley. In 2023, everyone was sitting on the fence. It's a bit like the real-estate market: sellers are still asking for the old prices buyers have already realized that the situation has changed and are not willing to pay so they are waiting - and the result is that no deals are being made. But they will happen, and that is certain. So, I believe that these investments will be made in 2024. \\\"And another encouraging thing: foreigners invested less, but they did not abandon Israel last year, which is quite impressive. The main decrease was registered with the Israeli investors. They 'fortified themselves in the bunker' more than the foreign investors.\\\" This week the government approved a support package and a budget of one billion shekels to promote the high-tech industry, especially startups. This involves funds that will invest in early-stage companies and will urge investments in venture capital funds, in the establishment of incubators and more. Do you think these are steps that can really meet the challenges? \\\"This is an important signal both to the Israeli ecosystem and to foreign players: not only does the government recognize the importance of high-tech, but it is also active, putting its hand in its pocket. We just need to check carefully how much of the budgets in question constitute a real addition, and how much is a re-packaging of existing budgets. \\\"Another thing that stands out in this plan is the ministry of finance's trust it puts in the Innovation Authority. There is a willingness to pour resources and run programs through this body, unlike, for example, the finance ministry's proposal to cut the budgets of chief scientists in several ministries. On the other hand, what is very, very negative in my opinion is the cut from the higher education budget. In general, the fact that this budget is under the Ministry of Education makes no sense. If it was under the Ministry of Science, the perspective would have been different you see that the Minister of Education is more interested in NIS 200 million for the general education budget than for Council for Higher Education. Do you agree that Israel missed the train in terms of leading the artificial intelligence? \\\"AI is like electricity – it's a huge wave, which affects in length, width and depth. The government had a national plan regarding AI already in 2018, led by Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, but it did not materialize. And in fact, all that has to do with the development of AI infrastructures, such as ChatGPT - we are far behind, also in terms of academic research, with a small exception such as AI21 Labs by Amnon Shashua and Yoav Shoham. \\\"Revolutions of this type require investment in research infrastructures, technological infrastructures and staff, and at least the cooperation of the government, which was not the case here. This is also an area that the size plays a significant role, and we are in a position of weakness to begin with. Since 2018 we've had political crises, Covid and a judicial overhaul there has not been one single normal government, which was able to think ahead. We are paying a price for it. Technology in the world does not stop. However, in everything related to application of AI technology within products - there are already more than 2,000 companies in Israel who engage in that, and their number will continue to grow.\\\" Can you fix this situation? \\\"AI is going to be present in our lives for many years. So, let's say that if you change the diet of a four-year-old it won't work the same as if you fed him properly from the age of two months, but you can still greatly improve his health.\\\" How do you see the Israeli high-tech map in the next two years? \\\"We have chosen several focal areas, which we are trying to promote with the help of many initiatives, mainly in the worlds of 'deep-tech': health (health-tech), climate (climate-tech), food (food-tech) and agriculture (ag-tech). These should be the growth engines of Israeli high-tech, because these are the world's challenges. We can be a significant player in each of them: there is a sufficient number of companies, academic knowledge, excellent hospitals, and advanced agriculture tools. These fields are also beneficial for the country: the occupational mix involved in them is better – as there are not only engineers and programmers, but also biologists and technicians, agronomists and more.\\\" No doubt, you are a hopeless optimist. \\\"Listen, you have to leave Israel in order to understand how special this place is with all that's happening here: this bubbling of ideas, which also derives from the craziness we live in, a country where everyone, all the time, has to be an entrepreneur. It must be in our blood, which is amazing. And besides, as long as the other components are here - investors, human capital and a supportive government - I will remain optimistic.\\\"",
