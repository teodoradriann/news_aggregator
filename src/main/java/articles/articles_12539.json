    "text": "Awe-inspiring Daggett Rock is seen June 15 in Phillips. Rebecca Richard/Franklin Journal\nDaggett Rock, seen June 15 is split into three pieces, and has a path to follow through the split in the rock which is located in Phillips. Rebecca Richard/Franklin Journal\nDaggett Rock, the largest glacially transported erratic in Maine is an awe-inspiring natural wonder located in Phillips. Glaciers can transport chunks of rock over long distances. When these rocks are eventually deposited, they are often far from their original location. These transported rocks are called glacial erratics. Erratics provide a record of the glacier’s journey.\nAccording to mainetrailfinder.com , one legend says, Daggett, a local woodsman, found the rock while drunk during a violent storm. He climbed on top of it and cursed his bad luck. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck the rock, splitting it into three pieces.\nDaggett Rock measures 80 feet long, 30 feet wide and 25 feet high and is estimated to weigh 8,000 tons. This massive granite boulder with feldspar crystals likely originated from the Saddleback Mountain area. Geological evidence shows that Daggett Rock split when it was deposited where it now sits thousands of years ago.\nIt is easily accessible via a short, rocky trail with an incline from Wheeler Hill Road. It is a rocky trail which makes the hike a bit of challenge as you must watch out for loose rocks to avoid tripping. Daggett Rock sits prominently at the end of the trail, you can’t miss it. It is a beautiful sight, as you get to the top of the hill and the light pours in as you reach the clearing around the enormous rock. It is worth the journey for young and old. Children love trying to climb on the huge rock. Visitors are advised to watch out for poison ivy. Depending on the time of year, mosquitoes could be a nuisance so keep that in mind as well.",

    "text": "SEATTLE — The San Jose Sharks allowed four goals in less than eight minutes to start the second period in what became a 6-2 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Thursday at Climate Pledge Arena.\nWith the game tied 1-1 after the first period, the Sharks allowed even strength goals to Oliver Bjorkstrand and Brandon Montour with 51 seconds apart, with Montour’s goal, coming off a bad San Jose turnover, giving the Kraken a 3-1 lead at the 2:54 mark of the second period.\nAfter the Sharks failed to capitalize on a power play opportunity, Jaden Schwartz, just after his tripping penalty had expired, took a pass from Jamie Oleksiak, raced in on a breakaway and beat goalie Yaroslav Askarov on a breakaway for his 18th goal of the season.\nAskarov was then pulled by Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky, as the rookie goalie had allowed four goals on 11 shots, although he had little to no chance on one or two of the goals against.\nWith Alexandar Georgiev coming in for Askarov, Montour capped the scoring at the 7:52 mark of the second. With the Kraken on 5-on-3, Montour took a pass from Jared McCann and beat Georgiev for his 10th goal of the year.\nCarl Grundstrom and Tyler Toffoli scored for the Sharks, who have now lost seven of their last eight games.\n Grundstrom’s goal, at the 17:55 mark of the first period, came when he tried to return a pass in front of the Seattle net to Will Smith, but the pass went off Shane Wright’s skate and past Kraken goalie Joey Daccord.\nToffoli’s goal came in the third period and gave him 18 on the season.\nAt the 6:39 mark of the second period, Sharks defenseman Henry Thrun got into his second career fight as a professional as he and Kraken defensemen Vince Dunn dropped the gloves to the side of the Seattle net. Both players received five minute fighting majors, but forward Nikolai Kovalenko received an extra two minutes for roughing.\nKovalenko finished the second period but did come out for the third period for undisclosed reasons.\nFor the game, the Sharks were without several players, including center Alexander Wennberg, who has a nagging upper body injury and was ruled of Thursday’s game in the morning. Also injured for the Sharks right now are forwards Nico Sturm and Ty Dellandrea, and Klim Kostin, and defenseman Jan Rutta.\n©2025 MediaNews Group, Inc. Visit at mercurynews.com.

    "title": "Victoria Beckham's Posh Ride: Chauffeur Picks Up Fashion Icon from London Eatery Amid Foot Recovery",
    "text": "Victoria Beckham's recent outing in London showcases not just her resilience but the lengths to which her team goes to ensure her comfort during recovery. Spotted being whisked away by her chauffeur directly from the doorsteps of a chic Notting Hill restaurant, the fashion mogul's post-Fashion Week celebration turns heads for more reasons than one.\nAdvertisment Seamless Support in Style Recovering from a foot injury sustained a few weeks prior, Victoria Beckham has been navigating public appearances with crutches and a medical boot. This hasn't slowed her down, however, as evidenced by her attendance at the end of a bustling Fashion Week season. Her latest collection's success in Paris was a cause for celebration, culminating in a dinner at the Michelin-starred bistro Dorian. Not leaving style at the doorstep, her exit was facilitated by a £200,000 Maserati SUV, strategically parked under the awning, minimizing her walk to a few steps. This special arrangement highlighted the dedication to comfort and care by her team, ensuring her mobility issues did not dampen the evening's spirits.\nLegal Implications and Public Reactions Advertisment While the gesture by Beckham's chauffeur was undoubtedly thoughtful, driving onto the pavement to facilitate an easier exit for the fashion designer raises legal questions. This act, though seemingly minor, is against the law and might lead to repercussions for the driver. Public reactions have been mixed, with many applauding the care shown towards Victoria's condition, while others pointed out the legal breach involved. The incident has sparked conversations about the lengths to which celebrities' teams will go to ensure their comfort and the potential consequences of such actions.\nVictoria's Resilient Spirit Despite her injury, Victoria Beckham's spirit remains unbroken. She has been seen actively participating in work and maintaining her fitness regime, albeit with adjustments to accommodate her foot brace. Her recent social media posts, including one where she humorously requested a medal from her husband David Beckham, reflect her resilient and positive attitude towards recovery. David's support, notably carrying her at events, underscores the couple's strong bond and mutual support during challenging times.\nVictoria Beckham's recent rendezvous in London is more than a tale of a celebrity navigating recovery; it's a testament to the power of resilience, the importance of support systems, and the complexities of balancing public life with personal challenges. As she continues to heal, the incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of life and the strength found in facing its hurdles with grace and determination. Beckham's journey of recovery, underscored by this recent outing, will undoubtedly be watched by fans and critics alike, offering insights into the intersections of celebrity, care, and the continuous pursuit of passion amidst adversity.",
