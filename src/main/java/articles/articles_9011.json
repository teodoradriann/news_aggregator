    "text": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday justified his decision to veto all art grants in the state in this year's budget by saying at least one of them had \"sexual\" content. \"You have your tax dollars being given in grants to things like the Fringe Festival, which is like a sexual festival where they're doing all this stuff,\" DeSantis said during a news conference, as [reported by The Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article289581896.html). \"It's like, how many of you think your tax dollars should go to fund that?\" the governor added. \"Not very many people would do that.\" According to the outlet, the festival has editions in both Orlando and Tampa. The former has featured such content, but the Orlando Sentinel's arts writer said it was \"always for a good reason and maximum comic effect.\" The festivals mainly feature live theater, concerts and \"kid friendly shows and activities.\" State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, told the Herald that she attended this year's festival and it wasn't sexual. \"It does feature drag queens and other forms of artistic expression that DeSantis has wanted to censor despite courts telling him otherwise!\" she said. According to Politico Florida, the Orlando edition of the festival received $150,000 and the Tampa one $15,000. Overall, DeSantis' veto on art grants amounts to some $32 million. The governor's spokespeople didn't answer questions about which events at the festival were sexual or if he was also making reference to others. Many other entities and organizations will be affected by the decision. \"Something like this could literally be the death knell for some organizations, and succeed in doing what COVID could not,\" the executive director of the Symphony of the Americas, Steven Haines, [told the Sun Sentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/06/20/serious-gut-punch-desantis-eliminates-state-arts-culture-funding-for-dozens-of-south-florida-organizations/). Bari Newport, from GableStage, told Axios that the funding will fall heavily on Miami-Dade, one of the largest funders for arts in the country. \"Many of these arts and cultural institutions are already relying heavily on the county to exist,\" she said. Overall, the veto cuts $6.5 million for the county, impacting more than 120 organizations, including the opera, theaters and art museums. At a state level the figure tops 600. The decision is part of a larger set of vetoes from the state's annual budget, which overall amount to some $900 million. Another scratched item that made the headlines was a program seeking to provide free tampons and pads in public schools. © 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Pottawatomie County, Kansas from 1901-2000 was 29.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Pottawatomie County, Kansas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Pottawatomie County, Kansas history.",

    "title": "US property insurance market woes more widespread than just California: ALIRT - Artemis.bm",
    "text": "When it comes to challenges in the property insurance marketplace, in relation to climate, weather, catastrophe losses and insurer’s ability to underwrite property business profitably, typically California or Florida are the poster child, but analyst firm ALIRT Insurance Research believes the issue is more widespread across the United States. ALIRT focuses on State Farm’s recent announcement of a further pull-back from writing business in California. The property insurance market there has faced significant challenges, after following some years of elevated property losses, in terms of implementing risk adequate pricing to make underwriting there sustainable. For some carriers, the wait for a better legislative environment that allows them to price their policies in a way they deem risk adequate, has been too long, resulting in pull-backs from a number of major players. While there are now steps being taken to improve the insurance market by lawmakers and regulators, such as [the recently announced rules to allow the use of forward-looking catastrophe models and to expand catastrophe model use to cover additional perils](https://www.artemis.bm/news/california-to-expand-use-of-catastrophe-models-to-wildfire-terrorism-flood-lara/), for some it is too late and likely to take effect after they have exhausted their risk appetite for writing new business there. Fast-forward to this week and State Farm announced its latest pull-back from California, saying its carrier “State Farm General Insurance Company is working to ensure its long-term sustainability in California.” The move features the non-renewal of some 72,000 policies, 30,000 California homeowners, rental dwelling, and other property insurance policies and 42,000 policies in the commercial apartment insurance sector, [as our sister publication Reinsurance News reported at the time](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/state-farm-to-pull-out-of-72000-california-insurance-policies/). Recall that [State Farm had said it was pulling back from the California property insurance market last May](https://www.artemis.bm/news/state-farm-exits-california-property-on-rising-cat-risk-reinsurance-costs/), with a plan to cease writing business and personal P&C property as it cites exposure growth, rising catastrophe risks and reinsurance market challenges as reasons for the move. The insurer is just [one of a number to either trim their property catastrophe exposure in the state](https://www.artemis.bm/news/california-legislators-ignore-property-insurance-crisis-as-more-insurers-pull-back/), suspend new business, or exit, in recent years, as the insurance crisis accelerated in California. ALIRT Insurance Research sees State Farm’s California carrier as “an excellent proxy for what other property insurers are likely facing in this market,” noting that its ALIRT Score of 40 for State Farm General Insurance Company is “just at the edge of ALIRT’s historically normal range of 39-61.” ALIRT adds, “Despite substantial direct premium growth over the past five years (66% growth since 2019), SFGIC has reported underwriting losses in four of these five years. The average combined ratio over this period was 114% vs. 103% for the ALIRT Personal Lines Composite. “SFGIC’s underwriting performance was particularly poor in 2023, with the company reporting a loss ratio of 108% (combined ratio of 138%), which reflects both poor accident year results (accident year combined ratio of 122%) plus substantial prior year reserve strengthening of $470 million, with additions for each of the past 10 accident years. “This underwriting loss would be even worse absent SFGIC’s cession of almost 20% of its direct written premium to parent State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Company.” The large operating loss for full-year 2023 contributed to a 40% decline in SFGIC’s policyholder surplus as of 12/31/2023, ALIRT further explained. “This hit to surplus, combined with the aforementioned strong direct premium growth, produced a spike in net premium leverage and a year end 2023 risk-based capital ratio of just 114%, which is almost 1/3 that of the current personal lines composite,” ALIRT continued. Saying, “We remind readers that breaching the company action level (CAL) of 100% in the risk-based capital regime can result in regulators requiring a remedial financial plan, a result previously unthinkable for a subsidiary of a leading personal lines organization like State Farm.” ALIRT Insurance Research then notes that, for other leading insurance groups, it’s harder to compare to State Farm’s experience, given the majority don’t have dedicated California writing carriers. But, the analysts also point out that, “For the time being, however, it is likely that the California homeowners and commercial property insurance markets will continue to face pricing and availability pressures.” Drawing back and looking more widely than just California though, ALIRT warns that these types of problems look more widespread across the US property insurance market landscape. “It is our belief, analyzing the weakening ALIRT results for homeowners and commercial multi-peril specialists writing businesses in other geographies, that this problem is not confined to the Golden State alone. The upcoming release of our year end 2023 executive summary flag letters will further demonstrate the financial toll that property loss trends are having on insurers in a growing number of states,” the analyst firm cautions. Which suggests we may increasingly hear of similar issues in other states’ property insurance marketplaces, all of which could mean a sustained push for higher inward rates from primary carriers as they look to adjust their business models to become more sustainable in these cat and climate exposed regions. All property insurers around the world are battling numerous pressures right now, from the inflationary upward-pressure on their exposure, to the effects of growing policy count as people move to desirable coastal and often cat-exposed regions, alongside the somewhat elevated severe weather catastrophe event frequency that has been seen, severe loss events such as wildfires and hurricanes, plus perceived climate-driven effects on the environment and weather patterns that are changing the risk landscape. Likely also meaning that reinsurance capital will remain more cautious in these peak catastrophe and weather exposed property insurance zones in the United States. Which may result in reinsurance costs remaining at more elevated levels, and reinsurer appetites remaining at higher-attachment levels, amplifying one of the most challenging financial and risk factors property insurers in the US face today, their ability to economically protect themselves, their customers and their shareholders. Inward premium rates and other levers such as investment returns, need to pay for loss costs, costs-of-capital, the expense of operations, a profit, and an outward reinsurance strategy. It seems there may be more work to do before that balances out economically and sustainably for the insurance industry.

    "text": "Thailandia, mamma e figlia finiscono con l'auto in un canale: l'eroico salvataggio dei passanti\nSiamo nel distretto di Kabin Buri, provincia di Prachinburi, Thailandia. Una donna, in compagnia della figlia di sei anni, perde il controllo della sua auto finendo in un canale. Il veicolo rischia di inabissarsi ma il tempestivo intervento di alcuni passanti si rivela risolutivo. Tre uomini riescono infatti ad avvicinare l'auto alla riva del canale utilizzando una fune. Nel giro di pochi istanti, uno di loro entra in acqua ed estrae incolume la bambina dall'autovettura. Anche la donna alla guida dell'auto abbandona il veicolo ormai ad un passo dalla riva senza troppa difficoltà. Mamma e figlia non hanno riportato ferite gravi e sono state portate nell'ospedale più vicino per accertamenti\nVideo Reuters00:47",

    "text": "[Next Article\n](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/chatgpt-now-lets-users-assign-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z/story)\n2024 becomes first year to exceed 1.5°C global warming limit\n[Akash Pandey](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/author/akash/271)\nWhat's the story\nThe year 2024 has broken a new record in the history of [climate change](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/climate-change), becoming the first year to cross the threshold of 1.5°C global warming.\nAccording to two independent data sets, average global temperatures last year were more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (roughly the average temperatures between 1850 and 1900).\nThe temperature rise was mainly driven by human-induced climate change and further exacerbated by the temporary El Nino weather phenomenon.\nClimate consequences\nRecord heat triggers deadly global impacts\nThe record-breaking heat of 2024 had dire real-world consequences, contributing to deadly flooding in [Spain](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/spain) and extreme drought in [Zambia](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/zambia).\n[India]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/india ) also bore the brunt of this climate crisis with extreme heatwaves killing hundreds in the northwest and east.\nMonsoon floods, landslides, and unprecedented bleaching of corals in Lakshadweep's reefs were also reported.\nClimate commitment\nParis Agreement's 1.5°C target: A symbolic threshold\nThe 1.5°C mark is critical as it is the warming limit set by countries in the landmark Paris Agreement.\nCrossing the threshold is believed to lead to more severe climate impacts.\nHowever, despite last year's breach of the limit, experts stress that it doesn't mean a permanent shift above 1.5°C of warming.\nSuch a declaration would only come after several consecutive years of crossing the level.\nEconomic impact\nZambia's economy crippled by worst drought in a century\n[Zambia]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/zambia )'s national coordinator for disasters, Dr. Gabriel Pollen, emphasized the devastating impact of the country's worst drought in over 100 years.\n\"No area of life and the economy is untouched,\" he said.\nThe drought has left six million people staring at starvation, caused a major drop in critical hydropower, resulted in frequent blackouts, and halved economic growth.\nCall to action\nScientists urge leaders to intensify climate action\nDespite the grim climate scenario, scientists stress that it's not too late to prevent further climate change.\nThey are urging world leaders to not only maintain but also intensify their climate action.\nProfessor Piers Forster from the UK's Climate Change Committee emphasized that \"every fraction of a degree\" still makes a difference in the severity of extreme weather events.\nClimate data\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 averaged 15.10°C\nAccording to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change service, global temperatures in 2024 averaged 15.10°C, making it the hottest year since records began in 1850.\nThe figure is 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels in the 1850-1900 period.\nThe UK Met Office's data corroborates these findings, confirming that last year was indeed a record-breaking year for [global warming]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/global-warming ).",
