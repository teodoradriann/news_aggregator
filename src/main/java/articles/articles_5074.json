( [WVUE](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/06/13/2-young-girls-missing-after-mother-found-dead-loranger-sheriff-says/)/Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well. The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 3-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect, Daniel Callihan, was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi. Police found the 6-year-old alive in Mississippi, with Callihan, according to authorities. Erin’s body was a few yards from where her sister was found alive. She was taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Her grandparents are on their way to Jackson to be with her. “You don’t want to see that as a police chief; you don’t want to see that as a father,” said Chief Joseph Wade from the Jackson Police Department. “A coward took this child from her family.” The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Jackson Police Department are also involved in the investigation. The Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning. According to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide. Her two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said. Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing. The manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.” Copyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Fabrizio Benvenuti\nVenticinque vigili del fuoco sono stati trasferiti con la mobilità di giugno: di fatto, con 40 uomini che già mancavano per completare l’organico del Comando, siamo sotto di circa 65 persone. In questo modo si allungano i tempi del soccorso\". L’allarme parte da Fabrizio Benvenuti , segretario provinciale Conapo.\n\"Questa situazione unita alla già conclamata carenza di automezzi porterà certamente ad allungare i tempi di soccorso tecnico urgente, ed a non riuscire a svolgere spesso gli interventi minori, non propriamente di soccorso immediato come abbiamo sempre fatto – dichiara Benvenuti –. Sembra che queste problematiche non interessino a nessuno a livello dirigenziale nazionale, infatti non vengono neppure concesse ore straordinarie, oltre quelle già stanziate per le carenze croniche, affinché si possano richiamare in servizio persone per completare almeno le squadre di soccorso\". Una così grave carenza di organico non si era mai registrata in passato, fa notare.\n\"In tanti anni non avevamo mai visto una carenza così importante e sappiamo che molti altri Comandi sopratutto del nord hanno le nostre stesse carenze – afferma infine Benvenuti –. Ci chiediamo a questo punto quando e se lo Stato intenda intervenire sperando di riuscire a svolgere comunque il nostro lavoro senza che nessuno debba rimetterci\". Per quanto riguarda i mezzi, il segretario provinciale Conapo ribadisce: \"La situazione è drastica: non abbiamo più automezzi di soccorso, sono pochi quelli funzionanti e operativi. Anche per quanto riguarda l’autoscala, a disposizione di tutto il territorio ne abbiamo soltanto una\".\nv.r.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",

    "text": "Ubisoft has just announced that Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has been delayed until March 20th. The game was meant to come out on February 14th . So, we’re basically talking about a one-month delay.\nUbisoft claims that this extra time will allow its dev team to further polish the game. This is the second time that AC: Shadows has been delayed as Ubisoft was initially planning to release the game on November 15th.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in 16th-century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era. In this game, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe and Yasuke. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.\nThe game promises to have spectacular castle towns, bustling ports, peaceful shrines, and pastoral landscapes. Ubisoft also claims that AC: Shadows will have unpredictable weather, changing seasons, and reactive environments.\nJust yesterday, Ubisoft shared some new videos that showcased the new parkour system of this new AC game. In December 2024, it also shared more details about its combat mechanics . So, I suggest reading those articles.\nFinally, AC: Shadows will not require a mandatory internet connection to play . However, it will be using the Denuvo anti-tamper tech . Since this is Assassin’s Creed we’re talking about, I don’t expect Ubisoft to remove it via a post-launch update. That’s a bummer but hey, it is what it is\nStay tuned for more!",

    "text": "CHICAGO – It’s last minute gift time, and Paramount Pictures has the Anniversary and Special Edition DVD collections that make great stocking stuffers for the cinema buff in your life. The videos below will highlight the titles, either celebrating major anniversaries with deluxe 4K Ultra HD releases, or packages of special release editions.\nLackluster ‘Dog Man’ Barks Up an Unfunny Tree\nPatrickMcDon January 30, 2025 - 9:12am\nRating: 2.0/5.0 |\nCHICAGO – A Big ‘ARF’ of rejection for this animated mutt that fails to fetch many laughs. Source book author Dav Pilkey (“Captain Underpants”) came up with Dog Man while in the second grade, and that’s about the upper age limit of those who may still find these sort of dim-witted antics entertaining.\nAfter a gruesome accident, a cop and his trusty dog are injured and surgeons sew the dog’s head onto the cop’s body. So Dog Man (vocal effects by Peter Hastings) is a crime fighter who loses focus whenever a ball is around and other assorted dog related behaviors. He lives in a dog house and that’s about it. His arch nemesis is Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson) … a megalomaniacal cat out to take over the world with various harebrained contraptions, but is constantly thwarted by Dog Man. The movie is largely based on the first few Dog Man books, but exhausts its source material in about the first 20 minutes. So it’s left to narratively chase its own tale for another hour or so to meet the bare minimum of cinematic running time.\nDog Man\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nThe problem lies in the books and the character of Dog Man himself. Although there have now been more than a dozen books, there’s precious little story in each one. And what’s there is wafer thin, so that doesn’t leave much on which to build the movie. The animated film successfully captures the style of the books, but there’s barely a scoop full of kibble here to sustain it, and the voice cast doesn’t make much of an impact either. In addition to Davidson – whose natural stand up style doesn’t lend itself to cartoon villainy – there’s Isla Fisher as reporter Sarah Hatoff, and Chicago’s own Lil Rel Howery in the stereotypical action movie role of “Angry Police Chief.”\nThe film aims for its Pixar moment when Petey makes a clone of himself, and winds up with an adorable kitten named L’il Petey who’s as sweet as his father is evil. While L’il Petey is the only character in this whole enterprise with a whisker’s worth of emotional depth, Dog Man the movie can’t sniff out a way to make something out of the dynamic.\nNone of this would matter much if it were funny, but it’s not. There are puns galore, including a robot named “80-H-D,” but it doesn’t succeed as a type of Zucker Brothers “Airplane” style joke-a-minute laugh fest, because the jokes come in fits and starts and mostly miss their mark.\n‘Dog Man’ to the Rescue\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nWe’ve grown spoiled by the films of Pixar and Disney, and occasionally Dreamworks, which offer sophisticated storytelling in animated form. So something like this, which resembles a cheap cartoon cash-in feature – although highly polished – from the 1980’s (think “Heathcliff: The Movie”) just doesn’t cut it. When Bill Murray’s “Garfield” movies seem like a laugh riot by comparison, you know there’s trouble.\nBy |",

    "text": "据环球时报8月13日消息，最近，国家网信办就美国英伟达算力芯片漏洞后门安全风险约谈该公司问题受到关注。与此同时，越来越多美国给芯片安“后门”的内幕也被曝光。\n8月13日，路透社又刊发独家报道爆料，美国秘密在人工智能相关芯片中设置追踪器，以发现“芯片被转运至中国的情况”。\n路透社报道截图\n报道称，据两位知情人士透露，美国政府已秘密在他们认为有可能被转运至中国的先进芯片目标货物中植入位置追踪装置。知情人士称，这些措施“仅适用于部分受调查的货件”。追踪器可为美方搜集个人或机构违反出口管制的信息。\n位置追踪器是美国执法机构数十年来一直使用的一种调查工具，用于追踪受出口限制的产品，例如飞机零部件。\n另外五名人工智能服务器供应链相关人士表示，他们知道戴尔和超微 (Super Micro）的服务器货物中使用了这些追踪器，这些服务器中包含英伟达和AMD公司的芯片。这些人表示，追踪器通常隐藏在服务器的产品包装中。\n两名参与服务器供应链的人士描述，2024年的一个案例中，一批搭载英伟达芯片的戴尔服务器不仅运输箱上装有大型追踪器，还在包装内甚至服务器内部隐藏了更小、更隐蔽的追踪装置。\n消息人士称，负责监督出口管制和执法的美国商务部工业与安全局通常参与这类行动中，另外联邦调查局（FBI）等部门也可能参与其中。\n对于美国限制对华出口先进人工智能芯片相关问题，中国外交部发言人林剑11日表示，中方反对将科技和经贸问题政治化、工具化、武器化，反对对中国进行恶意封锁和打压的立场是一贯、明确的。这种做法扰乱全球产供链稳定，不符合任何一方利益。\n本文来源：长安街知事 责任编辑： 张叶芳_NB25918",

    "text": "Forget all the home runs Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani often hits.\nFans have been curious over the past few weeks just who Shohei Ohtani sees when he runs home for a night in front of the television.\nIn other, far less confusing words?\nWho the heck is Shohei Ohtani’s wife?!?\nShohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers warms up on deck during the fifth inning of the MLB spring game at Camelback Ranch on March 12, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The former California Angels pitcher/designated hitter — who signed a $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers this past offseason — surprised fans last month when he casually announced he was married.\nOhtani didn’t identity his wife at the time, however.\nOn Thursday, though, Ohtani shared a photo with his new bride on his Instagram Story Thursday, according to Fox Sports.\n“Shohei Ohtani and his wife, basketball player Mamiko Tanaka, are heading to the Seoul Series!” Fox on MLB posted on Twitter, including a screen grab of the photo, as you can see below.\nSHOHEI OHTANI’S WIFE REVEAL!!!\nHe posted this photo on IG with Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka pic.twitter.com/doaCIwmnVk\n— Shawn Spradling (@Shawn_Spradling) March 14, 2024 So, just who is Mamiko Tanaka ?\nTanaka is 27 years old.\nShe is a 5-foot-11 Japanese center, who played for the Fujitsu Red Wave from 2019 to 2023 after a collegiate career at Waseda University and Tokyo Seitoku University.\nThe professional athlete most recently averaged 7.8 points and 6 rebounds per game, which isn’t shabby at all. Seems like a solid role player.\nShohei Ohtani probably hit a home run during this plate appearance. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) Ohtani previously said he had married “someone from my Native country Japan,” stating through his interpreter in February:\n“She is a Japanese woman, and I don’t really feel comfortable talking about when I got married, the exact date and stuff.”\nNow, though, we’ve learned that Ohtani has known Tanaka for about four years.\nHe decided this week to finally reveal her identity in order to make sure nothing about his personal life served as a distraction over the upcoming baseball season.\nShohei Ohtani in the dugout during spring training. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) Ohtani is a two-time American League Most Valuable Player.\nDue to his abilities both as a pitcher and a hitter, many consider the Dodgers superstar to be the most talented baseball player in the history of this great sport.\nOhtani, who will turn 30 on July 5 and who signed the biggest deal in sports history in December, smashed 44 home runs last year and hit .304.\nHe won’t be available to pitch in 2024 as he recovers from surgery to repair his right UCL in October 2023.",

    "text": "The new year rings in wage increases for Michigan workers LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Just as we rang in the New Year, Michigan’s minimum wage increased, requiring businesses to pay low-paid workers more per hour. Some advocates said it’s not enough. When the state legislature passed a bill saying minimum wage is now going up to $10.33 per hour, some businesses said they were against paying employees a higher wage. “If you look at the MIT Living Wage Calculator, that shows you the basic costs of food, housing, transportation, you’re way above 25 dollars an hour in terms of what people actually need to cover the cost of living,” said Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage. Jayaraman is fighting for proper compensation for working families. She said Monday’s wage increase is not enough for people in Michigan to cover the cost of living and keep up with rising inflation. She said, “A raise of a few pennies is not nearly enough to cover what people need.” Some businesses, like Henry’s Place in Meridian Township, already pay their workers more than minimum wage, leaving customers to deal with higher-priced menu items. “I mean, it’s good for the workers because I think they’re going to make more money. But I think it’s going to get passed down to the customers in the end,” said Henry Kwok, owner of Henry’s Place. Tim Nash, director of the McNair Center at Northwood University, said economists should set wages. He said setting a minimum wage requires employers to pay workers more than the market wants, causing jobs to relocate to a neighboring state with lower wages and taxes. “We’ve had a lot of businesses leave Michigan to go to Indiana, and you just worry if this is going to cause more of that to happen,” said Nash. Jayaraman said they are pushing to get a minimum wage of $15 per hour on the November 2024 ballot. Also, starting Jan. 1, minimum hourly wage rates for minors aged 16 and 17 will increase to $8.78 per hour. Tipped workers’ pay will increase to $3.93 per hour. The minimum wage increases could increase in 2024 depending on the outcome of a legal challenge filed by the Michigan Supreme Court.
