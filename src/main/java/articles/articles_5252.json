Stroud and the Houston Texans at Arrowhead Stadium.\nThe Chiefs are no strangers to playoff football under Reid and Patrick Mahomes. The franchise has gone to at least the AFC Championship game every season Patrick has been the starter; there is just something special about this time of the year.\nBut what makes it so great?\nReid offered up his opinion on that 1 special thing.\n\"You're one of the few standing first of all,\" Reid said. \"The preparation, you got to really take care of business there, the error margin there is tiny. Got to make sure that you play well, coach well, the whole works, which is great, we're in this to challenge ourselves. No better time than now.\"\nWith the Chiefs chasing a historic three-peat and aiming to become the first-ever team to achieve three straight Super Bowls, there is ample pressure on Kansas City to keep winning.\nRelated: Chiefs Mahomes Announces Playoff Prediction for Kelce\nA 15-2 regular season record, the No. 1 seed, and a first-round bye gave Reid's team its best shot at making a deep playoff run. But the Texans and Stroud will be no pushovers, and the Chiefs, it's worth remembering, having played a meaningful game in over three weeks, so rust could be a factor.\nIs that the edge the Texans have? Possibly, but let's not forget, the Chiefs have been here before several times, so they know how to navigate it.\nAnd as Reid said, there's no better time to challenge yourself than now.\nRelated: Chiefs Vets Helping Xavier Worthy Prepare For Playoff Debut\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.

    "text": "2/19/2025 Indonesia (International Christian Concern) — On the morning of Feb. 4, Christians living in Paccerakkang, Biringkanaha, Makassar, Indonesia, saw a banner telling them they were not welcome in the community.\nThe banner read, “We, all Muslims, residents of Paccerakkang, especially Neighbourhood 02 and 03 STRONGLY REJECT the Establishment of a Church and worship activities in our environment forever.”\nAn unknown person installed the ban n er in front of the Polda Housing Complex, Mangga 3, targeting the worship activities of the Toraja Church of the Lanraki Congregation. Residents removed the banner early that afternoon.\nThe content of the banner is seen as hate speech, and Christians in the community fear it could lead to increased hostility toward their community.\nAs a constitutional state, it must protect its citizens’ religious and worship rights. Article 29, paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution reads, “The state guarantees the freedom of each citizen to practice their respective religions and to worship according to their religion and beliefs.”\nThe banner also contains discriminatory content against the church. Of course, this rejection degrades the dignity of certain religious groups. This contradicts Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasizes, “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.”\nThe state fully guarantees the freedom to establish a church and conduct worship activities in it, individually or together. Indonesia has ratified international human rights instruments regarding the protection of the right to freedom of expression and religion.\nTherefore, every government instrument related to the banner, from Neighborhood to FKUB Makassar City, needs to take protective measures against church congregations and encourage persuasive actions that mediate religious conflicts as a form of prevention against discrimination and hostility between religious communities.\nTo read more news stories, visit the ICC Newsroom .

    "text": "TORONTO — Toronto was on the brink of its first major transit strike in 16 years as union leadership vowed it was ready to shut down service while the city's transit agency said there was still enough goodwill left to get a deal done before a midnight strike deadline. A strike could bring Canada's most populous city to a grinding halt. It would upend regular travel plans for tens of thousands of commuters who depend on its subways, streetcars and buses, while choking the city's already congested roadways. And unlike some Toronto transit strikes of the past, speedy back-to-work legislation from the province may not be a foregone conclusion. Ontario would not introduce a bill to end the strike unless Toronto requests it since the province is not directly involved in negotiations, a senior government source said, and any bill would likely not be introduced for weeks. The city's largest union of transit workers issued a statement that said as of 5 p.m. no progress had been made in its negotiations with the Toronto Transit Commission. \"ATU Local 113 will be moving forward with strike action tomorrow at 12:01 a.m.,\" read the union's statement. \"The TTC has left us no other choice, as we still need to prioritize a new fair agreement for our transit workers.\" If workers strike, a deal between the union and TTC would keep the system running until subway service ends, between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Wheel-Trans, the paratransit service for people with disabilities, would also continue uninterrupted. \"We're not trying to harshly remove service so that people are stranded or abandoned,\" ATU Local 113 president Marvin Alfred said at a news conference earlier Thursday. \"But we are doing our best to signal if you don't have to be in the system at midnight, why would you enter the system?\" The last TTC strike in 2008 ended after less than two days when the provincial government held a special weekend sitting to legislate the union members back to work. Several other ATU Local 113 job actions, including a record 23-day strike in 1970 and a 45-day work-to-rule campaign in 1989, have ended with legislation. TTC chair Jamaal Myers said early Thursday that he was \"encouraged\" that both sides remained at the bargaining table. He said the TTC was committed to securing a deal that avoids any job action that would be \"disruptive to the lives of millions of Torontonians.\" TTC spokesperson Stuart Green said the agency believes there is \"enough progress and goodwill that we can get an agreement without job action.\" Alfred dismissed those assurances and said the union was \"ready to pull the pin.\" Wages, benefits, and a number of job security issues are top sticking points for the union, Alfred said. The union wants protections against contracting jobs out to third parties and from cross-boundary service getting handed over to other Greater Toronto Area transit operators. Neither side has offered specifics on any proposed negotiating terms. A more than decade-long strike ban on TTC workers was recently lifted after a judge found a provincial law that labelled them essential workers was unconstitutional. Last month, the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal brought by the province and upheld the workers' right to strike. Transit workers were backed Thursday by the Ontario Federation of Labour. \"These workers lost the right to strike for 12 years but they didn't just go to sleep,\" OFL president Laura Walton said at the same news conference where Alfred spoke. \"For the last 12 years, they have been building the power that they needed. They were building the solidarity that they needed. And on behalf of 54 unions and one million members, I stand here proudly in full support of what ATU 113 needs to do.\" - With files from Allison Jones and Paola Loriggio.

    "title": "Safely Dispose of Batteries: Discover the Top Locations in Your Community",
    "text": "When it comes to battery disposal, it’s important to know the proper methods to ensure the safety of both the environment and your community. Batteries contain hazardous materials that can have a detrimental impact if not disposed of correctly. Fortunately, many communities have established designated locations for battery disposal. In this article, we will explore the top locations in your community where you can safely dispose of batteries.\nRecycling Centers One of the most common places to dispose of batteries is at local recycling centers. These centers are equipped with specialized facilities and resources to handle various types of batteries safely. Recycling centers often accept different kinds of batteries, including alkaline, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), and lead-acid batteries.\nWhen you bring your batteries to a recycling center, they go through a thorough sorting process. The different types of batteries are separated based on their chemical composition and placed in appropriate containers for further processing. Recycling centers either recycle or dispose of these batteries in an environmentally friendly manner.\nElectronics Retailers Many electronics retailers have taken steps to promote responsible battery disposal by offering collection programs within their stores. These programs allow customers to drop off their used batteries conveniently while shopping for new electronics or accessories.\nBy partnering with recycling companies or waste management organizations, electronics retailers ensure that collected batteries are handled properly. This partnership guarantees that hazardous materials from the batteries are disposed of safely and that valuable components are recycled efficiently.\nPublic Libraries Public libraries have become increasingly involved in environmental initiatives, including battery disposal programs. These community hubs often serve as collection points for used household batteries. By placing collection boxes within library premises, people can easily drop off their old or spent batteries during their regular visits.\nPublic libraries typically collaborate with local waste management authorities or recycling companies to ensure proper handling and disposal procedures for collected batteries. These partnerships help keep libraries involved in sustainable practices and encourage community members to responsibly dispose of their batteries.\nHazardous Waste Facilities For certain types of batteries, such as lead-acid batteries commonly found in vehicles or large appliances, it may be necessary to visit a hazardous waste facility for disposal. These facilities are equipped to handle hazardous materials safely and have specific protocols in place for battery disposal.\nHazardous waste facilities have the necessary expertise to manage different types of batteries effectively. They ensure that batteries are stored, transported, and disposed of according to strict regulations. If you are unsure about the appropriate disposal method for a specific type of battery, contacting your local hazardous waste facility is recommended.\nIn conclusion, it’s essential to dispose of batteries properly to protect the environment and your community. Recycling centers, electronics retailers, public libraries, and hazardous waste facilities are some of the key locations where you can safely drop off your used batteries. By utilizing these designated locations in your community, you can contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment while promoting responsible battery disposal practices.\nThis text was generated using a large language model, and select text has been reviewed and moderated for purposes such as readability.",

    "text": "Sections Highlight Seville Friday, 29 March 2024, 08:03 Compartir The Junta de Andalucía regional government is to implement a plan for the protection and conservation of the historical and artistic heritage of religious art, which will involve an investment of eight million euros over three years. Most of this budget, around 5.6 million euros, will be earmarked for conservation and restoration work in convents and monasteries that have been declared as assets of cultural interest. Following a cabinet meeting of the Junta's executive last Monday, the minister for culture Arturo Bernal presented the whole programme, which also includes initiatives relating to research, cataloguing, promotion and making this heritage more available to the public. Bernal stressed that around 80% of Andalucía's historical and artistic heritage is related to religious art, yet for decades no action was taken by the regional administration to target conservation and protection. \"For too long they have had to go it alone,\" said the minister, referring to the bishoprics, brotherhoods and fraternities, associations, foundations, religious orders and institutions and private entities, all potential recipients of this aid. \"We are now going to bring our capabilities to this area and we are going to support these groups,\" said Bernal who explained that, in terms of restoration, the subsidies granted under this plan will involve co-financing by the institutions and other bodies who benefit. Other proposals, such as promotion, research or cataloguing of assets, will be fully financed by the Junta. Other beneficiaries can include restorers, craftsmen and researchers, as well as public and private research centres. Turning to specifics, the programme has been approved for three years (2024-2026) and consists of five lines of action. The first is research and spreading the word with the aim of identifying, learning more about, and disseminating the religious aspects of Andalucía's cultural heritage, including the region's heritage held in religious documents. The second is cataloguing with the aim of listing assets and activities of interest. The third, which will account for most of the investment, is the conservation and restoration of both fixed and mobile assets that form part of the region's religious, cultural heritage. The Junta intends to protect these assets by means of calls for subsidies that involve direct action to preserve. The programme also includes more promotion of the region's religious heritage and sacred art (the fourth line of action). The fifth and final action is to make this heritage more available to wider society. Publicidad Publicidad Te puede interesar Publicidad Publicidad Necesitas ser suscriptor para poder votar.

    "text": "The untimely death of model and actress Shefali Jariwala has not only sent shockwaves across the nation but also reignited the conversation of Indian’s obsession with youth, beauty and fairness.\nDuring the investigation, one of the biggest details that came out was Shefali’s unsupervised and long-term usage of skin whitening and anti-ageing treatments, particularly glutathione and Vitamin C.\nShe was taking these treatments for 8 years without active medical supervision after initial consultation, said police sources.\nAs per reports, a stockpile of anti-ageing pills, multivitamins, and glutathione vials was found in Shefali’s room, which was on her table, and even inside her fridge.\nBecause if their benefits like skin brightening, anti-pigmentation effects and signs of reverse-ageing, the popularity of glutathione and Vitamin C has been ever-increasing in India. Not only tablets, these drugs are also sold in the form of intravenous (IV) drips and injections.\nIn 2025, the glutathione market is estimated to be valued at USD 324.6 million and is expected to reach insane USD 585.8 million by 2032.\nDespite the hype, its benefit remains highly doubtful, with long-term medical research suggesting that its usage can have side effects like allergic reactions to kidney and liver complications, with extreme cases, misuse or self-medication can be fatal.\nWhat is the cost of Glutathione and Vitamin C IV drip\nThe cost of these treatments and therapies highly depends on the location, right from metro-cities to other places as per NDTV.\nThe cost can range from Rs 4,000 to Rs 12,000 per session in the clinics of Gurugram, it varies depending on the strength of the dosage and number of sessions. On the other hand, these treatments are sold as packages in Delhi, with a 5-session package costing up to Rs 35,000, while a 10-session plan could set you back nearly Rs 60,000.\nIn Mumbai, the Glutathione IV session starts with Rs 8,000 with at-home service along with a trained medical person. Talking about the packages, a 6-session package is priced at Rs 38,400 while an 18-session package costs around Rs 1,08,000.",
