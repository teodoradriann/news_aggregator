    "text": "Service & Sacrifice: Keeping Us Safe\nA snapshot of the burdens being shouldered by brave U.S. troops and military families around the world.\nMiddle East\nAs\nchaos continues in the Middle East, more than 1,500 U.S. military service members are headed to the troubled region to fight terrorism.\nEarlier this week, a large ceremony was held at a sports arena in Trenton, New Jersey, to bid farewell to the state’s deploying National Guard soldiers. The brave men and women in uniform will be tasked with fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, where Iran-backed terrorist groups have\nlaunched well over 100 attacks since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel in October.\n“It is the largest deployment of New Jersey Army National Guard soldiers since 2008,” according to U.S. Central Command.\nOne of the departing soldiers is Lt. Col. Omar Minott, who\nspoke to CBS Philadelphia about how his deployment will impact his loved ones.\n“With a two-parent household, having me leave is a challenge with our four kids,” Lt. Col. Minott told the TV station. “But my wife is … she’s pretty strong.”\nPlease join The Stream in praying for the safety of these 1,500-plus soldiers and the well-being of their families here at home. America is grateful for your selfless service and willingness to confront the evils of terrorism.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nNothing could demonstrate the sacrifices of our military more than this week’s news that two U.S. Navy SEALs went missing off the coast of Somalia.\nThe SEALs, who went missing last Thursday, “were boarding an un-flagged vessel at night when one fell into the ocean. Another SEAL jumped in to rescue him,”\naccording to KPBS. Iranian missiles were later found by the SEAL team upon boarding the ship, which was bound for Yemen.\n“That effort it is ongoing,” U.S. Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder said about the search for the missing SEALs during a Wednesday news conference at the Pentagon. “Certainly, you know, we hope that we are able to recover our teammates. Our thoughts and prayers are clearly with their families at this time.”\nAs we pray for the safety of the missing SEALs, the U.S. military is pounding terrorist targets in Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthis have been launching attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial ships in the Red Sea. According to the military, American ships and submarines took out 14 Iranian missiles during Wednesday’s wave of counterattacks.\n“The actions by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla in a statement\nposted on X. “We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners and we will always protect our people.”\nPlease continue to pray for our nation’s valiant troops and their families.\nComing Home\nA squadron of U.S. Navy pilots returned to their Virginia Beach base earlier this week after spending eight long months patrolling the Mediterranean Sea.\nWelcome home, heroes! Thanks to you and your families for sacrificing so much to keep our country safe.\nTom Sileo is a contributing senior editor of The Stream.

    "title": "Norway tops Europe for electric vehicle uptake as the UK lags behind By Proactive Investors",
    "text": "The electric vehicle market has been expanding rapidly across multiple geographic fronts in recent months, even as faltering sales in 2023 raised alarm that uptake may not be as swift as originally expected. New research from electronic registration portal Vignettecroatia.com analysed the latest 2022 data from Eurostat, to see which European countries had the highest percentage of electric vehicles. Norway blew the rest of Europe out of the water with a staggering 20.12% of all vehicles in the country now electric – that accounts for more than 600,000 vehicles out of a total of just over 3 million. Rest of Europe lags behind The runner up on the list is Denmark, where just over 4% of vehicles are now electric, a far cry from Norway’s stellar performance. Speaking in real numbers, Germany currently boasts the overall highest number of electric vehicles on its roads with just over one million registered, but that accounts for just 2.08% of the country’s total registered cars. The UK rounded out the top ten, with just 1.93% of registered vehicles being electric. European countries with the highest percentage of electric vehicles. “While electric cars are more common and affordable than ever, they still are an expensive purchase at a minimum for a lot of Europe,” Vignettecroatia.com spokesperson Luka Stojčević said. “Even some of Europe’s highest income countries, as seen in this list, still see electric vehicles as a rarity compared to other fuel types. “However, as technology improves and overall production becomes cheaper, we can expect this list to shuffle around as more countries buy into the market.” ASX companies servicing the EU electric vehicle market More than a handful of ASX-listed companies have recognised the critical and battery metal opportunity presented by the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, and especially the opportunity offered by the European Union. Altech Batteries Ltd (ASX:ATC, OTC:ALTHF)’s main laboratory is based in Perth, Australia, where the company developed its battery material coating technology for the electric vehicle market. The company’s research is focused on coating silicon with high-purity alumina (HPA), for inclusion within electric vehicle battery anodes. To that end, Altech has proposed an 8,000-tonne per annum silica-alumina anode battery materials coating plant in Germany. A definitive feasibility study (DFS) revealed a pre-tax net present value (NPV10) of €684 million for the proposed plant, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 34%, a payback period of 2.4 years and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of €105 million per year. Read more: Altech Batteries CERENERGY® battery project DFS outlines “excellent” project economics Volt Resources Ltd (ASX:VRC, OTC:VLTRF) is also targeting the electric vehicle battery anode material market. The company holds two graphite projects and plans to build a natural graphite anode powder production plant in the US state of Alabama. Its Bunyu Graphite Project in Tanzania produced a solid feasibility study, offering a mining and processing plant throughput rate of 24,780 tonnes per annum of graphite products, with a pre-tax NPV of US$58.9 million, and IRR of 31.5%, a payback period of 2.9 years and an EBITDA of US$169.6 million. Read more: Volt Resources’ feasibility study update highlights improved economics of Bunyu Graphite Project Stage 1 Recent test work on Bunyu flake graphite has produced strong results, successfully meeting the requirements specified by the customer in terms of particle size, particle size distribution, density, moisture and carbon content. The company also holds a 70% interest in the Zavalievsky Graphite (ZG) business in Ukraine, where the mine and processing facilities have been in operation since 1934 with access to lithium-ion production markets. Volt says ZG benefits from an existing customer base and graphite product supply chains based on excellent transport infrastructure covering road, rail, river and sea freight combined with reliable grid power, ample potable ground water supply and good communications. Unfortunately, the conflict in Ukraine has complicated the situation, although the facility resumed operations on August 1, 2022, following lengthy periods of disruption from the war. Supplying the lithium itself European Lithium Ltd (ASX:EUR, OTCQB:EULIF) is approaching the electric vehicle industry from the other direction – supplying high-grade lithium concentrates. The company holds a controlling interest in the Wolfsberg Lithium Project, which was recently listed to the Nasdaq under the name Critical Metals Corp. The project holds a mineral resource estimate of 2.88 million tonnes of measured, indicated and inferred resources at 1% lithium oxide in just the first exploration zone. A recent DFS demonstrated a post-tax net present value (NPV) of US$1.5 billion at a 6% weighted average cost of capital mined over 15 years. Wolfsberg has already drawn attention from other stakeholders, with a binding offtake agreement with BMW in place, and an agreement with Obeikan to build a lithium hydroxide processing plant in Saudi Arabia. In addition to Wolfsberg, the company has a further 245 exploration licences covering a total area of 114.6 square kilometres just north of Wolfsberg, with initial surface sampling grading up to 3.98% lithium on the tenure. Read more: European Lithium price “should be higher” based on Critical Metals Corp. successful Nasdaq performance, says analyst Infinity Lithium Corporation Ltd (ASX:INF) is taking a similar approach in Spain, with the flagship San José Project in the Extremadura region, where the company is working closely with the regional government to develop the project. The company intends to build a fully integrated supply chain for battery chemicals at San José, which currently holds the crown of the EU’s second largest hard rock lithium deposit. Using green hydrogen as a fuel source, and its own San José project as feedstock, the company will build a downstream lithium hydroxide conversion plant on 11 hectares of land within the granted Exploration Permit in Extremadura S.E. Read more: Infinity Lithium soars on gaining strong endorsement of San José Lithium Project with €18.8 million government grant A scoping study has forecast annual steady-state production of 195,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) of battery-grade lithium hydroxide over 26 years, at a rate of 2 million tonnes per annum for the first 22 years.

    "title": "#54 Los trabajadores de un Burger King desobedecen a la dirección y paralizan la cocina tras superar los 34 grados",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#6](c6#c-6) Si las condiciones de trabajo ponen en riesgo tu vida estás legitimado a dejar el trabajo (no recuerdo exactamente en que ley viene, y si lo expresa tal y como lo escribí)\n[#31](c31#c-31) [#32](c32#c-32) Real Decreto 486/1997, \"la temperatura máxima en los lugares de trabajo cerrados no podrá superar los 27 grados centígrados\". De hecho, si la temperatura excede los 33 grados centígrados, se considera un riesgo grave para la salud de los trabajadores.\nY te lo dice un informático que en su dia vivió alucinando pepinillos como el jefe de la sección sindical paró la oficina por estar medio dia a 32 grados. Le plantó al jefe en la cristalera de su pecera un termómetro del chino con cinta americana, con una nota que decía \"Nos vamos todos a la piscina municipal si pasamos de esta marquita roja, no esperes nada de nadie\". El aire acondicionado se arregló mágicamente en media hora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) a ver nosotros con termómetros de los chinos paramos camiones en la pista del aeropuerto, lo que desconocía hasta hoy es lo de irte si en interior se superan ciertas temperaturas.\nAprendí algo nuevo\n[#38](c38#c-38) [#31](c31#c-31) [#32](c32#c-32) no era ese real decreto( que también le afecta).\nEra la ley PRL\nArtículo 21. Riesgo grave e inminente.\n1. Cuando los trabajadores estén o puedan estar expuestos a un riesgo grave e inminente con ocasión de su trabajo, el empresario estará obligado a:\na) Informar lo antes posible a todos los trabajadores afectados acerca de la existencia de dicho riesgo y de las medidas adoptadas o que, en su caso, deban adoptarse en materia de protección.\nb) Adoptar las medidas y dar las instrucciones necesarias para que, en caso de peligro grave, inminente e inevitable, los trabajadores puedan interrumpir su actividad y, si fuera necesario, abandonar de inmediato el lugar de trabajo. En este supuesto no podrá exigirse a los trabajadores que reanuden su actividad mientras persista el peligro, salvo excepción debidamente justificada por razones de seguridad y determinada reglamentariamente.\n\"Según la legislación laboral, la temperatura en un trabajo en interiores nunca puede superar los 25 grados. A partir de este linde, las compañías están obligadas a instalar mecanismos de acondicionamiento para evitar riesgos laborales. Y esto es lo que, siempre según la versión sindical, no ha hecho la dirección de Restaurant Brands Iberia, la firma comercial que gestiona gran parte de los establecimientos de Burger King en España.\"\nTitular alternativo: \"Los trabajadores de Burger King aplican la norma laboral que les impide trabajar a 34º\"\n[#17](c17#c-17) no sé absolutamente nada del tema. Pero con mi opinión de cuñado: no veo porque no se iba a poder refrigerar una cocina a 25 grados. No veo la incompatibilidad por ninguna parte.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Para complementar tu aportación porque es un poco inexacta.\nla temperatura de los locales donde se realicen trabajos sedentarios propios de oficinas o similares estará comprendida entre 17 y 27 ºC y la temperatura de los locales donde se realicen trabajos ligeros estará comprendida entre 14 y 25 ºC.\nPor otro lado, la Guía técnica para la evaluación y prevención de los riesgos relativos a la utilización de los lugares de trabajo, señala que la temperatura óptima para locales cerrados donde se realicen trabajos sedentarios estaría entre los 20 ºC y los 24 ºC en invierno, y entre los 23 ºC y los 26 ºC en verano y, para el caso de actividades ligeras, los rangos se situarían entre los 21 ºC y 25 ºC para verano y los 16 ºC y 22 ºC para invierno.\nhttps://www.ugt.es/la-temperatura-en-los-centros-de-trabajo-debe-ajustarse-la-normativa-de-prevencion-de-riesgos\nEn cualquier caso, trabajar a 34º no entra dentro de ninguna normativa y los trabajadores hacen lo correcto.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Artículo 19.5 del Estatuto de los Trabajadores:\nLos delegados de prevención y, en su defecto, los representantes legales de los trabajadores en el centro de trabajo, que aprecien una probabilidad seria y grave de accidente por la inobservancia de la legislación aplicable en la materia, requerirán al empresario por escrito para que adopte las medidas oportunas que hagan desaparecer el estado de riesgo [...]\nSi el riesgo de accidente fuera inminente, la paralización de las actividades podrá ser acordada por los representantes de los trabajadores [...]. El acuerdo será comunicado de inmediato a la empresa y a la autoridad laboral, la cual, en veinticuatro horas, anulará o ratificará la paralización acordada.\nAhora a ver cómo actúa la autoridad laboral. Pero dado que ya existía un historial médico de afectados, está totalmente justificado.\nDe ahí lo importante que es haber realizado elecciones sindicales en tu empresa, aunque seáis menos de 50 trabajadores. Y sea cuál sea el sindicato, lo importante es como sean tus representantes.\nEn lo referente a la temperatura que indica el artículo:\nReal Decreto 486/1997 de 14 de abril:\nAnexo III\n3. En los locales de trabajo cerrados deberán cumplirse, en particular, las siguientes condiciones:\na) La temperatura de los locales donde se realicen trabajos sedentarios propios de oficinas o similares estará comprendida entre 17 y 27 ºC.\nLa temperatura de los locales donde se realicen trabajos ligeros estará comprendida entre 14 y 25 ºC.\nb) La humedad relativa estará comprendida entre el 30 y el 70 por 100, excepto en los locales donde existan riesgos por electricidad estática en los que el límite inferior será el 50 por 100.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Totalmente cierto y de acuerdo contigo... Después siempre salen los de: \"is qui lis sindiquitis ni sirvin, yi pisi di fillinis, lis mirisquidis...\"\n[#1](c1#c-1) No te extrañe que sea algún Paco el Bajo que esté de encargadillo para ir con la factura de la luz a los jefes y esperar que le tiren un hueso y le acaricien la chepa mientras compañeros y clientes se achicharran.\nDe estos hay a patadas.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Yo diria que estas empresas suelen tener un precio pactado con la que les suministra luz. La novia de un amigo lleva un DIA y es asi, y si no le entendi mal paga un precio fijo al mes; sera por eso que tienen el aire acondicionado a 5º en los locales.\n[#8](c8#c-8) No creo que vaya por ese lado, para poder hacerlo tenés que cumplir 1 requisito:\nTener aires acondicionados independientes.\nGeneralmente este tipo de locales por cuestiones económicas utilizan un solo equipo para todo el local, y ahí nace el problema, los sensores se colocan en el salón donde están los clientes a 25° y esa \"supuestamente\" es la temperatura de la cocina.\nPero claro, con los fuegos, motores, freidoras el calor es muy superior a los 25° que marca la ley ¿Cuál es el problema? Qué si ponés los sensores en la cocina para llevar ese espacio a los 25° congelas a todos los clientes.\nLo extraño, es que no conozco cocina que pueda estar a 25° y he trabajado en muchas con medidas superiores a 34°. No sabía hasta ahora de esta regulación .\n[#1](c1#c-1) si te ahorras la pasta del aire acondicionado y le da un vahído a un empleado o cliente y acaban en el hospital o fallecen, la jugada les puede salir muy cara. Un plan sin fisuras\n[#46](c46#c-46) Espero que tuvieran la delicadeza de ponerle una sábana o la chaqueta por encima para no ver un rictus mortis\n[#1](c1#c-1) Puedes centralizar en un único control los aires acondicionados de un edificio, depende del sistema.\nhttps://www.mitsubishielectric.es/aire-acondicionado/series/controles-centralizados-2/\n[#1](c1#c-1) Mi pareja trabaja en una academia de idiomas y ya en mayo-junio que hace calor le decia a la jefa que pusiera el aire, le contestaba que ya estaba puesto pero hacia mucho calor. Eso si, luego entraba en su despacho y hacian falta crampones y piolets para llegar al escritorio\nSiempre he dicho que se empezaría a luchar contra el cambio climático, pero de verdad... Cuando la empresas empiecen a perder dinero de verdad por el cambio climático\nHay que ser GILIPOLLAS para no dar agua fresca a tus trabajadores en una cocina, no mala persona ni nada similar(que también), GILIPOLLAS, te creas problemas por un gasto NIMIO para la empresa y de sobras justificado... te estas tirando piedras a tu propio tejado.\nYo siempre digo que un jefe o empresario puede ser CABRÓN y salirle bien la jugada(economicamente hablando), pero ser cabrón no significa hacer todo lo posible por joder, significa ser egoista y mirar para ti, que tus trabajadores pasen calor y sed por un coste de unas pocas decenas de euros al mes en un local es absurdo y va en contra de tu propio rendimiento economico y resultados CLARA-MENTE como diria shakira...\nEs decir, si eres cabrón, sé cabrón, pero sé LISTO a la vez, GILIPOLLAS.\nLuego sacaran una normativa de que hay que mandar de forma telematica la temperatura a una web central del gobierno desde varios puntos del establecimineto y los empresarios se quejaran de que les hacen gastar dinero...\nDe ese tipo de empresas se pude esperara todo, siempre hay el clásico trepa que jode a sus compañeros.\nEstuve comiendo allí el fin de semana pasado y el calor en el comedor era insoportable, no me quiero imaginar en la cocina. Se ve que habían quitado los aires acondicionados (se veían las marcas en la pared) y estaba todo el mundo sudando del calor.",
