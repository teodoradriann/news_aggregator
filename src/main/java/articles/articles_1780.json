    "text": "Deputy Prime Minister reveals how many women carry out combat missions on front line More than 10,000 women soldiers are currently performing combat missions directly on the front line, according to the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Olha Stefanishyna. &quot;Ukrainians resist Russian aggression as a united people - both women and men. More and more women are serving in the defense forces, and currently, over 10,000 women are performing combat missions on the front line,&quot; said Stefanishyna. She also emphasized that the role of women is crucial in the country&#039;s recovery, particularly in developing Ukraine&#039;s economic potential. &quot;We have also rethought the role of women in the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine. We already have a large program that envisions women having more access and being actively involved in the recovery and reconstruction process,&quot; noted the Deputy Prime Minister. Women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine According to the Ministry of Defense, almost 70,000 women are currently serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, most of whom are military personnel. In October of last year, we reported that since 2021, the number of women in the Ukrainian army has increased by 12,000, or 40 percent.",

    "text": "It’s not enough for progressives to alter how America views gender and sexuality. Now, they want to change the meaning of yet another word: [Virginity](https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2023/06/30/the-lefts-latest-attack-on-virginity-is-the-latest-attempt-to-get-at-your-children-n769554). [Planned Parenthood](https://redstate.com/tags/planned-parenthood) released a video on Thursday arguing that the traditional understanding of the concept of virginity is inaccurate. According to the [video](https://youtu.be/ozhO62z2nag?si=7YM9NcHDCq4O68Iy), virginity is not necessarily someone who has not had sex, but something more. “Virginity is a completely made-up concept,” the woman in the video explains. “It’s a term that was created simply to control and shame people, mainly women.” She goes on to explain that “another reason the idea of virginity is complete nonsense is that sex means different things to different people,” and that “society tends to define sex in a very narrow way.” She adds: Warning: contains sexual terms Generally speaking, society tends to define sex in a very narrow way. Penetration, penis into vagina. But where does that definition leave queer people or folks who can't or don't have penis and vagina sex and choose to have oral, anal, or another type of sex instead? The woman continues, highlighting the double standard society places on women versus men when it comes to sex and virginity. There is also a double standard on who carries the burden of virginity. Society puts pressure on men for not having sex at the exact same time, they shame women for having it. Make it make sense. Either way, shame has no place in someone's personal decisions about sex. Near the end of the video, the woman argues that it is “time to throw away the notion of losing your virginity.” We hope we are gaining things like intimacy, self insight, pleasure, and empowerment. All of these myths around sex and virginity can be so hurtful and overwhelming. But here's the one truth you should remember. Sex is defined by one thing and one thing only, you. Maybe that's being fingered for the first time. Maybe it's having anal sex. Maybe it's having your first orgasm. Maybe it's masturbating for the first time or when you enthusiastically consent to sex. That's the beauty of your sexual journey. Virginity! What is it? What it isn't. And what’s the big deal about \"losing\" it? Let’s talk about it:— Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) [https://t.co/pOQllDfAHo] [pic.twitter.com/yANUxTaF8s] [January 25, 2024] The woman made some valid points, when it comes to the double standard related to virginity. But the rest of her diatribe was just more far-leftist claptrap intended to challenge traditional norms. This is an effort to dismiss the value that many cultures and individuals place on the concept of virginity. The concept carries significant emotional, cultural, and religious meaning for many people around the world who value the idea of being sexually abstinent until marriage. If someone doesn’t believe in this concept, then they do not have to practice it. But the notion that Planned Parenthood and others would try to completely transform the definition of the word is yet another way the far left seeks to foist their ideology onto the rest of the country.",

They spend between four and five months in Kenya, then fly back to Lake Natron for breeding,” Kimaru said.\n“They have come in large numbers and they all look healthy, signifying a successful breeding season. The birds often fly back to Kenya to spend more time and feed after a successful breeding season.”\nKimaru said the birds flocking back to Lake Bogoria often coincides with the tourism peak season, which he says has seen tourism numbers grow.\nMajor tourist hotels in the area are enjoying high visitor turnout.\nLake Bogoria Spa Resort manager Lydia Dentewo said their facilities were stretched almost to the limit following the birds’ migration.\n“Our accommodation facilities are fully booked for the next two months. We are in the process of setting up more than 120 additional rooms and tented camps to cope with the high number of customers seeking accommodation,” Dentewo said.\nLake Bogoria is a World Heritage Site under the Kenya Lake System, which comprises lakes Nakuru and Elementaita.\nThe flamingo population in Lake Nakuru has decreased over years, which has been attributed to the increasing water levels and pollution. Lake Bogoria host larger populations of flamingos in the region.\nA recent report on the status of World Heritage Sites in Africa proposed that other lakes, which play a critical role in survival of flamingos, be included on the World Heritage List. They include Lake Natron in Tanzania, a key breeding haven for flamingos.\nThe flamingos, the report said, mainly nest in Lake Natron, while flocks also exist in lakes Manyara and Eyasi and in Ethiopian lakes such as Abijatta, Shalla, Metehara, Chitu and Aranguade.",

    "text": "New Testament Christian Academy hosts Black History career fair MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) --- As Black History Month comes to a close, New Testament Christian Academy is hosting a Black history career fair focused on the areas of science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). There are two important parts of the career fair. First students will share presentations on Black Americans who've held successful STEAM careers in history. Then they will learn more about possible future careers for themselves. The goal is to open students up to all the potential opportunities they can take as they get closer to graduating and entering high education. School officials say students are exposed to STEM and the arts on a daily basis. The career fair hopes to show them what they can do with those skills, while also celebrating important figures in Black history. \"I want them to remember the contributions of those from the past who worked so hard....to help make a way for us,\" said Renee Johnson, Academy Director. The academy is also celebrating its state report card results, which showed students tested above the 83rd percentile for English Language Arts and Math.",

    "text": "Tech on the Slopes: PLU computer science students create a scheduling app for White Pass ski patrollers\nbritt.board/ February 27, 2025\nBy Britt Board\nAssistant Director of Communication\nFor years, White Pass Ski Patrol volunteers juggled schedules with paper spreadsheets and manual tracking – until a team of students helped create a solution.\n“We needed something more efficient, something that actually worked for us,” said Chuck Caley, a longtime ski patroller and project collaborator. As part of PLU summer program, students developed the White Pass Ski Patrol Scheduler, an app now used by nearly 160 volunteers to coordinate shifts, track participation, and streamline operations.\nThe project was led by PLU students Stacie Spahr ’25 and Andrew Lee ’26, alongside high school students Boen Liu and Brent Hu. PLU\nProfessor Jeff Caley and industry professionals Andy Caley and Anastasia Bidne guided the students. Their combined efforts resulted in an efficient tool that simplifies scheduling and enhances administrative tracking.\n“These projects function like part-time internships,” Jeff Caley explained. “They had the opportunity to apply their software engineering skills to a real-world problem, developing a product that over 100 people are now using.”\nOvercoming development challenges\nCreating an app that met the ski patrol’s needs proved to be a challenging yet rewarding process. Andrew Lee, a junior studying computer science and applied mathematics, explained, “The biggest challenge was replicating their existing pen-and-paper system in a digital format. Their business logic was quite complex, and it really showed when working on the check-in and sign-up systems.”\nComputer science major Stacie Spahr, another lead developer on the project, emphasized the teamwork that made problem-solving possible. Despite the challenges, Spahr found the process deeply rewarding. “Seeing the app in action after all our hard work was incredibly satisfying,” Spahr said. “It’s one thing to build something in a classroom, but another to create something that people will actually use.”\nAndy Caley, one of the project’s industry mentors, highlighted the impact of seeing the students’ work come to life. “As the summer progressed, we started bringing in ski patrol members to do live user tests with our application. Seeing the satisfaction of the students as they watched their hard work being used in real-world scenarios was so satisfying,” Caley shared.\nA transformational tool for ski patrol\nThe need for a digital solution was clear to Chuck Caley, a longtime White Pass Ski Patrol volunteer. His son, Professor Jeff Caley, saw an opportunity to turn that need into a hands-on learning experience for his students.\n“The app is way more efficient because it allows each volunteer to pick and choose what days they wish to patrol while also ensuring coverage is distributed appropriately,” Chuck Caley explained.\nBeyond scheduling, the app also provides an administrative advantage. “It tallies how many days each patroller is on the mountain and helps the administration track participation. Overall, it makes data analysis easier,” Chuck Caley said.\nThe White Pass Ski Patrol Scheduler has also helped ease the transition from manual to digital processes, even among those less familiar with technology. “Some patrol members were resistant to replacing their old system,” Lee noted. “The app needed to be good enough to win them over. We were all committed to making that happen.”\nThis was a great opportunity to learn to work in a professional environment with a team. PLU offers such a supportive environment, and that is what makes it so great here.\nLearning by doing\nFor the students involved, the experience has been invaluable. Lee appreciated the mentorship and practical learning opportunity. “A lot of credit goes to Professor Caley – he actively creates opportunities for students to gain valuable experience, and I’ve always appreciated that.”\nSpahr echoed those sentiments, “This was a great opportunity to learn to work in a professional environment with a team. PLU offers such a supportive environment, and that is what makes it so great here.”",
