However, other players aren’t having the same issues on other platforms.\nOver the last few years, Warzone has become a solid meeting point for a number of Call of Duty titles. Weapons from at least two games get to face off and look to claim superiority in the meta.\nHowever, the Black Ops 6 integration with Warzone hasn’t quite gone according to plan. Despite the new game having the omnimovement system for, well, better movement, the battle royale has felt more sluggish than ever before . Plus, we still have Urzikstan as the main map, a location that wasn’t built with the new movement system in mind.\nArticle continues after ad Warzone performance is lacking on Steam Now, Steam users believe that you’re doing yourself a disservice playing on the platform versus console or BattleNet.\n“I tried playing the new Warzone with the Omnimovement update on Steam. I got around 120fps with A 4070S And 7800X3Dm” Redditor Deathless729 reported . “I also played the Multiplayer through Xbox app and got around 200-240 there.\nArticle continues after ad “I felt 120 fps was super low, and it even felt WAAY less than 120, it was supper stuttery. So I found videos showing Steam vs Xbox & BattleNet. You get 50% FPS on Steam in the latest Warzone update.”\nArticle continues after ad It isn’t just a one-off case, though, as other players reported similar issues. “I just tried a Warzone game on Steam, 40 fps on an RTX 3060 i5 11400f, low everything,” another noted.\n“I think these issues are also starting to bleed into multiplayer as well. My FPS has dropped by like 50-60 frames in the last week alone,” commented another. “Yeah can confirm for me, 80-90 FPS hard locked. No matter what settings changed. Went and installed it on BattleNet, 150-160 FPS easily,” another added.\nRelated: Best Warzone controller settings: Aim assist, sensitivity, response curve, & more Article continues after ad Dexerto / Activision Warzone Season 1 brings all the weapons and systems from BO6. Some players have suggested that recent updates to Steam, giving players the ability to record in-game clips may have broken something.\nHowever, others suspect that the anti-cheat is also creating some of the problems.\nArticle continues after ad It remains to be seen if the devs will acknowledge the Steam-specific problem. Hopefully, it gets ironed out before long.\nkeep reading Call of Duty Warzone gets big movement buffs making it more fluid than ever Jacob Hale Call of Duty Warzone November 20 update patch notes: Movement changes, Assault Rifle buffs, more Brad Norton Call of Duty Best Warzone PC settings for higher FPS Calum Patterson Call of Duty Warzone & Black Ops 6 Nov 19 update patch notes: Double XP tokens return & hitmarker improvements Ryan Lemay Call of Duty Warzone players claim it’s ‘worse than ever’ after Black Ops 6 update Nathan Warby Call of Duty Black Ops 6 players hit out at “stealth nerf” to fan-favorite streaks Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone & Black Ops 6 Nov 15 update patch notes: Double XP tokens removed and custom loadout increase Ryan Lemay Call of Duty Warzone’s Black Ops 6 integration is off to a great start but there’s one huge fix needed Jacob Hale Related Topics Black Ops 6 Warzone About The Author Connor Bennett\nConnor Bennett is Dexerto's News Editor in the UK team.

    "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Communities across southeastern North Carolina were treated to a spectacular light show Thursday, Oct. 11, as the aurora borealis painted the evening sky. Some may have been able to see it with their bare eyes, but long-exposure photographs revealed the breathtaking sight in greater detail. Many viewers submitted their photographs to WECT, some of which can be viewed below. Did you take a great picture or have an awesome video? We want to see it! Click here to upload them ! You also can find See It, Snap It, Send It on the WECT News app. Just click on Sections and scroll down to See It, Snap It, Send It! “The aurora is formed from interactions between the solar wind streaming out from the sun and Earth’s protective magnetic field, or magnetosphere,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains. “The aurora is one manifestation of geomagnetic activity or geomagnetic storms. “As the solar wind increases in speed and the interplanetary magnetic field embedded in the solar wind turns southward, the geomagnetic activity will increase and the aurora will become brighter, more active, and move further from the poles. Even moderate solar wind creates aurora so there is usually a weak aurora somewhere even when there isn’t a big geomagnetic storm.” More information about the aurora borealis can be found here .

Picture date: Thursday December 28, 2023.\nMikel Arteta admitted his side came up short in both boxes as Arsenal slumped to defeat to West Ham to miss out on regaining top spot in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners remain behind Liverpool as they lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on what Arteta conceded was one of the most frustrating nights of his four-year tenure as Arsenal boss.\nTomas Soucek’s opener – awarded after the VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build up – and a second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos earned the visitors a deserved win.\nA defence masterclass from David Moyes' side ⛔️ #FestiveFixtures pic.twitter.com/yN2hZVa5SN\n— Premier League (@premierleague) December 28, 2023\nThings could have been even better had Said Benrahma not had a stoppage-time penalty saved by David Raya on a night where Arteta applauded the performances of the opposition.\n“I congratulate West Ham and praise my players. That’s what I can tell you,” he said.\n“This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\n“If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That’s the only thing. I can’t imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn’t enough to win the game.”\nAsked if it was among the most frustrating nights of his managerial career, Arteta replied: “It is. But it’s football. Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games.\n“That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n“We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably, that’s for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.”\nArteta successfully fought a Football Association charge after he criticised the officiating and VAR in defeat at Newcastle last month and was less vocal this time.\nHe did, however, suggest technology needs to be further advanced to make close calls, adding: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.\n“If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.”\nFor West Ham and manager David Moyes, this was a rare taste of victory at the Emirates Stadium – Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United.\nWest Ham were 17th at the turn of the year but went on to win the Europa Conference League and now sit just four points off the top four after this hard-fought and deserved win.\nDavid Moyes and his team had a good night (Adam Davy/PA) Moyes is out of contract in the summer but, on the four-year anniversary of his reappointment as West Ham boss, feels a new deal will soon be ironed out.\n“We’re getting ready to talk,” he told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t think any of us are jumping to get it done too quickly, I think we are just happy to make sure we get it done. We will do, I don’t see any problems with that at all.\n“We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe is a great period.”",

    "text": "The City of Louisville unveiled its first fleet of fully electric trash and recycling trucks Wednesday, saying the city was the first in the country to do so . \"To be the first municipality in the country to adopt an electrified fleet showcases their desire to find tangible solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change,\" Richard Coupland, Republic Services vice president of municipal services, said. Louisville will completely replace its current fleet of trash and recycling trucks by the end of the year. This will contribute to the city's Sustainability Action Plan goals and Republic Services' goal to operate more than 50 EVs across the country by the end of 2024. The four new trucks in Louisville are McNeilus Volterra electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions, according to Republic Services. They have audible devices to alert other drivers and pedestrians of their presence to counteract how much quieter EVs generally are compared to traditional trash trucks. The EVs will also have automated braking systems and sensors if drivers drift out of the lane lines, Republic Services said. One of the chief concerns with any electric vehicle is the distance it can travel before it needs to be charged again. Republic Services responded to that by saying: \"Collection trucks drive short distances, travel at slow speeds and make many stops and starts during a route, all of which are factors that make our fleet ideal for electrification. Plus, all trucks return to a base overnight where they can be recharged.\" \"The technology already has been proven in other cities with more challenging climates than ours,\" Louisville Mayor Chris Leh said . \"What's more, it is cost-competitive for our taxpayers.\" This is part of a trend nationwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make electric vehicles more widely used. 6:20 PM, May 09, 2024 Environment EPA offers grants to swap heavy-duty vehicles for zero-emission versions Around $932 million in grants are available for communities to swap out heavy-duty vehicles, like trucks and school buses, for electric versions. It can be costly to buy electric vehicles for these purposes. The EPA is accepting applications for grants to help cover such costs, including related infrastructure costs through July 25.",

    "text": "En entrevista para Heraldo Media Group, durante el programa \"Romandia en el Heraldo\", el coordinador del Partido Revolucionario Institucional en la cámara baja, [Rubén Moreira](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/nacional/2024/7/2/quien-es-ruben-moreira-valdez-conoce-al-proximo-diputado-617350.html), comentó sobre la crisis que se vive dentro del PRI tras las recientes asambleas y la opinión política y pública alrededor de [\"Alito\" Moreno](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/nacional/2024/7/11/pedro-joaquin-coldwell-fue-albazo-de-alito-para-reelegirse-no-una-asamblea-nacional-del-pri-620103.html). \"Los resultados electorales siempre son producto de los contextos\", mencionó al referirse al los resultados electorales del partido tricolor en los comicios del 2 de junio, así mismo, Moreira señaló que los número del [PRI](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/nacional/2024/7/11/pri-cual-sera-el-metodo-con-que-elegiran-su-proximo-dirigente-nacional-619937.html) en las elecciones son un reflejo de problema estructural en país y la falta de representación en algunas localidades, por lo que se debe transformar el partido acercándose a las necesidades de la población.

De Igual forma, Rubén Moreira refrendó su apoyo por \"Alito\" Moreno, puntualizando en las decisiones democráticas alrededor de su dirigencia, explicó que solo tres militantes han llegado a la dirigencia de partido por medio de una votación interna, siendo Moreno Cárdenas el más reciente. ¿Qué pasará con el PRI? Respecto al futuro político e ideológico del PRI, Moreira afirmó que ahora se buscará un enfoque social demócrata. Argumentó que dentro del movimiento se necesita un cambio para conservar su vigencia en la política mexicana. \"Somos un partido que salió de una revolución, tenemos que dar el paso a ser un partido moderno\" Afirmó que se aspira un cambio a un partido en donde los militantes voten y en donde el PRI busque responder a la voz de la gente. Sobre las corrientes opositoras dentro de partido dijo que se tendrá compromiso ante los principios y la declaración de acción del movimiento. \"El militante tiene que responder a la ideología del partido\".",
