Ohad Zwigenberg / POOL / AFP via Getty Images Israeli officials’ ceasefire demands show that they aren’t just using ceasefire negotiations to prolong their genocide of Gaza, but also to secure permission to further deepen their colonization of Palestine, a UN expert has said.\nIn the latest ceasefire talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been insistent that Israel be able to maintain a permanent military occupation of Gaza’s border with Egypt and a corridor built by Israeli forces cutting across the middle of the Gaza Strip, which Israelis respectively call the Philadelphi Corridor and Netzarim Corridor.\nIsrael’s insistence on maintaining control over these corridors is a clear show of their intention to expand their ethnic cleansing and “eat up” more of Palestine, said Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories.\n“Under the guise of ‘ceasefire negotiations’ Israel is trying to create the conditions for permanent occupation and more land grab. Those familiar with Palestine’s history recognize in what is happening to the Palestinians under Israel’s unlawful occupation, the pattern of settler colonialism,” said Albanese on social media on Thursday.\nAlbanese shared an observation from University of Edinburgh international relations professor Nicola Perugini, who noted: “Corridors are key tools of fragmentation, enclavisation and land dispossession in the history of Israel’s colonisation of Palestine. Corridors (Allon Plan etc) were key in settling the West Bank.”\nRelated Story News | Human Rights Israel Is Evacuating Palestinians From Safe Zones With Critical Water Wells Israel’s ground assault is now so widespread that Palestinians have no escape from the front line. By Sharon Zhang , T ruthout August 22, 2024 Truthout The Allon Plan was a proposal drawn up by then-Deputy Prime Minister Yigal Allon after the 1967 war to annex Gaza, forcibly transfer Palestinians, and partition the West Bank. As part of the plan, corridors would be built to connect the areas partitioned to Israel and Jordan. The plan was never put in place, but experts have noted that its principles of annexation and forcible transfers have echoed across decades of Zionist policy.\nIndeed, over the past months, Israel has built two corridors in Gaza that analysts say indicate their intention for a permanent military occupation. According to Forensic Architecture , as well as the Netzarim Corridor, Israel has been building a road that gives Israeli forces direct access to Gaza City. The construction of these two corridors are “infrastructural indications of an intended military presence” in north Gaza, the group said.\nAt the same time, a permanent Israeli takeover of the Philadelphi corridor — a major sticking point for Netanyahu in negotiations — would mean that Israel gets to control the entirety of Gaza’s border, as its border with Egypt is the only side of Gaza not surrounded by Israel. Hamas has been strongly opposed to Israel’s occupation of the two corridors in negotiations.\nIn essence, Israel’s position in the ceasefire talks is for there to be no ceasefire — for Israel to be allowed to continue its genocide for as long as Israeli leaders desire — and for mediators to give Israel permission to expand its occupation of Palestine. This means that, if U.S. officials agree to an Israeli “ceasefire” plan, they are not only giving the green light to the genocide, but also for Israel to take steps toward annexing Gaza.\nCorporate media outlets have covered the ceasefire talks with abandon, willingly repeating U.S. officials’ claims that Hamas, not Israel, is opposed to a ceasefire — despite Hamas leaders’ clear acceptance of President Joe Biden’s three-phase ceasefire deal.\nThese outlets seemingly seek to obfuscate the truth of the negotiations and run endless cover for Israel; in fact, perhaps sensing Israel’s positioning in the talks, The Atlantic published a much-criticized article recently essentially seeking to redefine the entire concept of settler colonialism in order to absolve Israel of the bloody practice.\nExperts and commentators have noted that the true purpose of the ceasefire talks and the U.S.’s participation in them, is to give license for the genocide to continue.\nLike the Oslo process in the 1990s, analyst Mouin Rabbani said recently , the ceasefire talks serve as a way to “buy time” for Israel’s genocide. “[T]heir purpose is process, and their objective has therefore been to avoid reaching a ceasefire agreement rather than concluding one,” Rabbani wrote.",

    "text": "FreightWaves Omni alleges Forward CEO withheld, destroyed requested docs 閱讀整篇文章 Todd Maiden 2023年12月29日 上午12:33 · 3 分鐘文章 Interest and fees are piling up as Forward Air awaits its day in court. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\nA letter to a Delaware court overseeing a dispute between potential merger mates Forward Air and Omni Logistics says Forward and its CEO, Tom Schmitt, “wrongfully withheld” requested documents from board meetings discussing the transaction.\n“In short, it is not credible that after two custodial interviews, a motion to compel, and a partial production of calendar entries in response to that motion, Mr. Schmitt was under any misimpression that his cache of highly relevant notes was not required to be collected for counsel’s review and produced,” a Dec. 20 letter from Omni’s counsel to the Delaware Court of Chancery stated.\nIt said the documents were provided just hours after Schmitt submitted a court-ordered “note taking and destroying practices” affidavit and that some items continued to be destroyed after he was instructed not to.\n“We also do not accept Mr. Schmitt’s claims about the daily destruction of his daily calendar entries, which, by his own admission, continued after he received a litigation hold notice,” the letter said. “That daily destruction of documents continued through a critical period in which Mr. Schmitt participated in regular board meetings and discussions about the transaction and plans to avoid the transaction.”\nAll told, more than 1,300 pages of Schmitt’s handwritten notes and other items pertaining to the merger have been handed over to Omni.\nForward ( NASDAQ: FWRD ) announced in August plans to merge with freight forwarder Omni in a deal initially valuing the company at $3.2 billion. The boards of both companies approved the transaction, but some of Forward’s shareholders were rankled as the deal structure didn’t require their approval ahead of closing.\nA group of shareholders is attempting to block the deal , claiming damages and saying their rights as stockholders were breached when they weren’t permitted a vote.\nOther shareholders have openly criticized the debt-and-equity transaction, claiming the price tag is too high — roughly 18 times trailing adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding deal synergies. The deal would be 38% dilutive to existing shareholders, and Forward would be required to take on $1.4 billion of Omni’s debt, pushing leverage to roughly 4 times adjusted EBITDA at closing.\n繼續閱讀 Forward has asked the court to let it out of the deal , claiming Omni failed to meet pre-closing conditions and that its recent financial targets were worse than expected. A recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Forward showed Omni’s EBITDA was slightly negative in the first nine months of 2023 compared to EBITDA of more than $100 million in the same period of 2022.\nOmni has said it has met all requirements and that Forward is misusing a “no growth” projection as a way to exit the deal following backlash from investors. It has asked the court to force Forward to the closing table .\nA hearing on the matter is set for Jan. 19.\n“As will be shown at trial, these newly produced documents contain critical evidence relevant to the parties’ dispute, including evidence of what actually happened at Forward Air’s board meetings that is not reflected in the formal board record,” the letter read.\nThe deal price is currently closer to $2.6 billion given a 40% sell-off in Forward’s stock.\nForward has provided no update on the interest and fees it is incurring as part of the deal’s financing. Interest expense, after netting out interest earned in an escrow account, on $725 million of 9.5% notes issued in early October is roughly $100,000 per day. Fees to retain lender commitments for a $1.125 billion term loan facility were set to increase to nearly $310,000 per day after Nov. 23.\nFreightWaves didn’t receive a response from Forward or Omni prior to this publication.\nMore FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden\nTFI buying Daseke for $1.1B, contemplating spinoff of truckload unit\nAuction moves 2nd lot of Yellow terminals\nForward Air sells final-mile unit to Hub Group for $262M\nThe post Omni alleges Forward CEO withheld, destroyed requested docs appeared first on FreightWaves .\n熱門新聞 1. 2024年美股五大主題：降息、大型科技股、大選、亞洲及歐洲風險 2. 輝達不夠看！今年哪檔美股表現最狂？冠亞軍漲幅均破1,000% 3. 人行：內地移動支付普及率達86% 居全球第一 4. 大行估明年內地樓市續低迷 5. 憧憬聯儲局減息美匯指數跌至五個月新低 每百日圓兌港元高見5.5算",

    "text": "Low-carbon networks transform home heating\nAgriculture & Energy\nOne heat network developer is driving down green heating costs with this unique approach\nSpotted: Heating our homes has a huge carbon – and financial – cost, amounting to\n20 per cent of all CO2 emitted by the UK. Rendesco wants to change that and decarbonise domestic heating across the UK and Europe, by rolling out heat networks that can reduce costs for the consumer due to a unique financing approach.\nMost heating emissions in the UK come from burning natural gas, which is delivered by the nationwide ‘mains gas’ network. As a low-carbon alternative, Rendesco designs, installs, and maintains geothermal networks that use a central ground source heat pump and employ a system of underground hot water pipes and boreholes to directly distribute that heat to consumers. These kinds of heat networks also boost energy security by reducing the country’s reliance on imported fuels (such as natural gas). Alternatively, Rendesco also installs individual heat pumps that are located on and owned by just one property.\nRendesco is the UK’s leading independent clean heat developer, and Founder-CEO Alastair Murray explains how “over 10 years of heat use, borehole temperature, and operating data from our over 8,000 managed connections” gives the company leverage to make its installations “cheaper per unit than alternative solutions such as air source heat pumps.”\nIn addition, Rendesco’s joint venture with Last Mile Infrastructure, funded by InfraCapital and M&G, has enabled it to finance the networks upfront, something that other heat network developers aren’t usually able to do. This “innovative utility-style funding model reduces upfront capital expenditure and spreads costs across the system’s lifespan, leading to competitive pricing for customers and developers.”\nRendesco has already completed diverse projects, ranging from outfitting domestic new builds to complex retrofits. Alongside its Last Mile venture, the company recently completed a £6 million funding round to expand its operations in the UK and Europe. Investment was led by Clean Growth Fund, Eurazeo, and Aviva Ventures.\nWritten By: Oscar Williams\n5th July 2024\nEmail:\nWebsite:\nrendesco.com",

    "title": "The warmest December in Steele County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Steele County, Minnesota from 1901-2000 was 17.2. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Steele County, Minnesota experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Steele County, Minnesota history.",
