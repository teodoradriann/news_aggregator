Her office was ordered to align itself with internal trade laws and stop requiring these individuals to have 450 hours of nursing experience in Canada in the past two years or 1,225 hours over the past five years to be registered locally.\nThe college defended its now-defunct rules as a response to a wave of complaints about competency — such as the inability to take or interpret vital signs — made about professionals approved via its “labour mobility applicant” stream.\n“Over the last few days I’ve heard from some nurses who have had their confidence shaken, and so I want nurses to know: you are welcome in Manitoba,” Asagwara said Wednesday.\n“The creation of a dedicated navigation role, increased flexibility in documentation and assessment processes and efforts to reduce delays are tangible steps forward,” said the union leader who represents 13,000 nurses, many of whom are IENs.\nJackson said the union has long advocated for “a more compassionate, efficient and equitable registration process” that recognizes IENs’ diverse experiences and upholds public safety.\n“IENs are not the problem — systems that under-prepare and undervalue them are. We want IENs to thrive in Manitoba. We want them respected, supported and safe,” she said. “That means regulation must go hand in hand with wraparound supports in practice settings.”\nThe regulatory body’s news release touted the changes as a way to reduce duplication, improve clarity and help IEN applicants transition into the workplace faster.\n» Winnipeg Free Press",

    "text": "Choosing the right water filtration system in your home is crucial for making certain access to clean, safe water. With a wide array of systems available on the market, it will be overwhelming to decide which one greatest suits your needs. This article will guide you through the primary types of water filtration systems, including their benefits, drawbacks, and superb applications, that can assist you make an informed choice.\nWhy You Would possibly Need a Water Filtration System\nThe quality of tap water varies enormously depending on your location, water source, and local water treatment processes. Contaminants like chlorine, lead, heavy metals, pesticides, and micro organism can sometimes find their way into your home water supply. A water filtration system can remove these impurities, improving both the taste and safety of your water. Moreover, filtered water might be gentler on appliances, extending their lifespan and reducing upkeep costs.\nTypes of Water Filtration Systems\nSeveral types of water filtration systems cater to totally different wants, from whole-house filtration to portable water pitchers. Right here, we’ll cover a few of the most popular systems: activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis systems, ultraviolet (UV) filters, and water distillers.\n1. Activated Carbon Filters\nHow They Work: Activated carbon filters use a process called adsorption, where contaminants are trapped within the porous carbon material as water flows through it. These filters are particularly effective at removing chlorine, which can significantly improve the style and odor of tap water.\nPros:\n– Affordable and widely available\n– Good at improving water taste and smell\n– Easy to put in and replace\nCons:\n– Not efficient towards heavy metals, micro organism, or viruses\n– Require regular filter adjustments to maintain effectiveness\nBest For: Activated carbon filters are perfect for houses with relatively safe water sources that mainly need style and odor improvement. These filters are sometimes used in countertop or under-sink systems, and you can find them in water filter pitchers, which are affordable and handy for renters or small households.\n2. Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems\nHow They Work: Reverse osmosis systems use a semi-permeable membrane to remove a wide range of contaminants, including heavy metals, dissolved salts, and some bacteria. The process forces water through the membrane, leaving contaminants behind, and is typically combined with a pre-filter and post-filter for max effectiveness.\nPros:\n– Removes a broad spectrum of contaminants, including heavy metals and dissolved salts\n– Provides high-quality, purified water\n– Can significantly improve style\nCons:\n– Slower filtration process, which would possibly require a storage tank\n– Requires regular maintenance and replacement of filters and membranes\n– Wastes a portion of water during filtration (typically 3-4 gallons wasted per gallon purified)\nBest For: Reverse osmosis is a superb alternative for households with higher contamination levels in their water supply, especially if the water incorporates heavy metals like lead or arsenic. This system is commonly used under the sink and provides a continuous supply of clean drinking water.\n3. Ultraviolet (UV) Filters\nHow They Work: UV filters use ultraviolet light to disinfect water by killing bacteria, viruses, and different microorganisms. While UV filters successfully neutralize biological contaminants, they do not remove chemical impurities, metals, or dissolved salts.\nPros:\n– Highly effective at sterilizing water and removing organic contaminants\n– Does not alter the taste or odor of water\n– No chemical by-products\nCons:\n– Ineffective towards chemical contaminants, heavy metals, and sediments\n– Requires a consistent power supply to operate\n– Usually combined with another filter for comprehensive purification\nBest For: UV filters are well-suited for properties that source water from wells or areas where organic contamination is a primary concern. They’re often paired with other filtration systems to achieve full-spectrum filtration.\n4. Water Distillers\nHow They Work: Water distillers operate by heating water to the boiling level, capturing the steam, and condensing it back into liquid, leaving contaminants behind. This process successfully removes many impurities, including minerals, heavy metals, and a few micro organism and viruses.\nPros:\n– Produces highly purified water\n– Efficient at removing most contaminants, together with heavy metals and dissolved solids\n– Simple upkeep\nCons:\n– Sluggish filtration process\n– Distilled water can style flat because of the removal of helpful minerals\n– Requires electricity to operate\nBest For: Water distillers are ideal for individuals needing highly purified water, similar to those with compromised immune systems or specific health concerns. Nevertheless, they are less practical for households needing a big volume of water daily.\nSelecting the Right System for Your Home\nWhen selecting a water filtration system, consider factors comparable to your local water quality, household size, and budget. Here’s a quick guide that will help you choose:\n1. Fundamental Style Improvement: If your primary goal is to improve water taste, an activated carbon filter might be all you need. It’s affordable, straightforward to put in, and does a superb job of reducing chlorine taste.\n2. Complete Purification: For more full filtration, particularly if your water incorporates a range of contaminants, a reverse osmosis system may be definitely worth the investment. Nonetheless, be prepared for the higher maintenance costs and slower filtration rate.\n3. Biological Protection: If your primary concern is organic contamination, such as bacteria or viruses, a UV filter can offer efficient protection. Just keep in mind that it’s often utilized in conjunction with different filters.\n4. Highest Purity: For those needing exceptionally pure water, a water distiller is one of the best option. While it could also be slower and more costly, it successfully removes nearly all contaminants.\nFinal Thoughts\nInvesting in the fitting water filtration system can significantly impact your water quality, health, and total home experience. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each filtration type, you may select a system that meets your wants and ensures access to safe, clean water. Whether you want a simple filter for higher-tasting water or a sturdy system to handle a range of contaminants, there’s a solution to fit every dwelling and lifestyle.\nIn case you loved this information along with you want to be given more details regarding Anion-Exchange Resin WATERRO A500P kindly visit our webpage.",

Thanks to a rare [geomagnetic storm](https://greaterlongisland.com/northern-lights-could-be-viewable-again-this-week-on-long-island/), the aurora was visible as far south as Alabama, with the best views on Long Island around 7 p.m. The Northern Lights have been viewable multiple times this year on the Island, including in [August](https://greaterlongisland.com/northern-lights-viewable-once-again-on-long-island/) and [May](https://greaterlongisland.com/great-photos-long-islanders-took-of-the-northern-lights-this-past-weekend/). Long Islanders didn’t miss the chance to capture the moment, sharing stunning views to [Greater Long Island](http://greaterlongisland.com) on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/greaterlongisland/posts/pfbid02TqaJhmuC9rCbMWeWWvmjSxrgY73GsYKmiPxrSNfUsSghscXthpKH7jbdosNUz3Kol).

    "text": "Middle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Video above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokesAfter at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic.Stroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group.Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier research has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages.But the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report.Also, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people.Middle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report.In 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group.Experts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.\"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications.\"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\"Stroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors.But it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say.Strokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic.The younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help.\"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",
