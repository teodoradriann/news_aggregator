    "text": "Group of Palestinian-Americans skip Blinken meeting over Biden admin’s support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza\n(CNN) — A number of Palestinian-Americans refused to attend a roundtable meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday to discuss the\nsituation in Gaza in protest against the Biden administration’s ongoing support for Israel’s offensive in the war-torn strip – a military campaign that has exacted a massive humanitarian toll.\n“We do not know what more Secretary Blinken or President (Joe) Biden need to hear or see to compel them to end their complicity in this genocide,” several of those who rejected the invitation said in a press statement distributed by the non-profit Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU).\n“They show us every day whose lives they value and whose lives they consider disposable. We will not be attending this discussion which can only amount to a box-ticking exercise. Our families, our community and all Palestinians deserve better,” the signatories wrote.\n“There is one thing that we, our community and countless others around the US and the world, including American unions representing nearly 8 million workers and at least 47 US cities, have been asking of this administration: to demand a permanent ceasefire to save Palestinians lives and stop the destruction of Gaza,” they wrote. “A meeting of this nature at this moment in time is insulting and performative.”\nBlinken and other members of the Biden administration have\ncalled on Israel to do more to protect civilians and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The officials, however, have continually rejected the idea of a ceasefire, instead advocating for “humanitarian pauses.”\nThursday’s meeting with Blinken comes amid continued outrage from many progressive Democrats, Muslim and younger voters about the administration’s handling of Gaza – opposition that poses a growing political problem for Biden. The refusal of several invitees to attend underscores the immense anger felt by many in the United States – including some within the federal government – over the toll from the conflict, which was launched following\nHamas’ brutal attack on Israel on October 7. More than 26,000 have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and Gaza is on the brink of famine. More than 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive.\nSix people did attend the meeting, a source familiar told CNN, and those who attended felt conflicted about doing so, but felt they should take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the need for urgent change in US policy toward Gaza.\n‘Soul-searching’\nOne of the invitees to the roundtable, Dr. Tariq Haddad, said in an intensely personal, 12-page letter to Blinken that he initially intended to go to the meeting.\nHowever, “after a lot of soul-searching I have decided that I cannot in good conscience meet with you today knowing this administration’s policies have been responsible for the death of over 80 of my family members including dozens of children, the suffering of hundreds of my remaining family, the famine my family is currently subjected to and the destruction of all my family’s homes,” Haddad wrote in the letter.\n“The more I thought about this meeting, the more I could not emotionally bring myself to look you in the eyes, Secretary Blinken, knowing you and President Biden have knowingly contributed to the suffering and murder of so many of my family, the homelessness and dispossession of 2 million Gazans, and the famine that has befallen my remaining family members,” Haddad said.\n“How does one meet for what I was told would be 3 minutes, with a person you hold responsible for not just the killing of your child, but rather the murder of over 80 of your family members?” he asked in his letter.\n“How do I look you in the eyes knowing you couldn’t even do the basic minimum like calling for a ceasefire to end the suffering and carnage, and even worse, are cutting off humanitarian assistance to 2 million people going through a famine of historic proportions,” he wrote, appearing to reference the suspension of US aid to the UN’s main relief agency in Gaza, UNRWA.\n“My family are subsisting on animal feed, Secretary Blinken, because of your policies,” he said.\n“You could have called for a cease-fire at any point in the past four months and ended all this suffering and death, and you have not. You could have used your diplomatic pressure to end the suffering, and you chose not to. You could have recognized that shutting off aid to an area that is experiencing the worst famine and human rights disaster in modern history is unethical, yet you chose not to. This is why it is very difficult emotionally for me to meet you today, to somehow normalize a meeting with an administration that continues day after day to cause so much suffering and death with their policies,” he wrote.\nHaddad urged Blinken to call for an immediate ceasefire, “end the continued transfer of US military reserve equipment to the Israeli military to stop further murder,” “call for an immediate withdrawal out of Gaza and equality for the Palestinian people,” and a “call for an end to the Israeli occupation, for equal rights, freedoms, and laws in this land regardless of one’s religion, ethnicity, or background.”\nHaddad told CNN that the letter – in which he also included photos of some of his relatives who have been killed – was going to be handed directly to Blinken at Thursday’s meeting.\nThe source familiar with the meeting said some parts of it were read out loud to the top US diplomat during the hour-and-a-half long session at the State Department. That source said Blinken seemed engaged, but largely stuck to talking points in his remarks.\nAt a briefing Thursday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed that Blinken met with “a number of leaders in the Palestinian-American community.”\n“It was the latest in a series of meetings that the Secretary has had with individuals and organizations both within the department and from outside the department that hold a wide range of views across the ideological and political spectrum,” Miller said. “He has held these meetings because he thinks it’s important to hear directly from individuals as I said, both inside the State Department and outside the State Department.”\n“He finds that process to be constructive. It informs his thinking. It helps him, he believes, shape policy in the best way possible,” he said.\nPublic opposition\nAnd while Blinken was quietly confronted behind closed doors about the administration’s policy toward Gaza on Thursday, members of the administration, including Blinken, have also faced public displays of opposition. A number of protesters have camped in front of Blinken’s house since last Friday to try to pressure a change in policy.\nAt a public speech on Tuesday, Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was twice confronted about the administration’s position toward Gaza.\nOne questioner, who identified herself as a USAID contractor, asked Power about the loss of the US’ ability “to be moral leaders” due to the “US funded genocide in Gaza.” Another person interrupted her speech to raise the massive humanitarian toll.\n“It is a devastating situation where not enough resources are getting in, via the Rafah crossing or the Kerem Shalom crossing,” Power said. “And we are working 24/7 to try to dramatically expand the flow of food, medicine, shelter – I mean, so much is needed. But, you know, you have families right now that are living in unimaginable conditions.”\n“In addition, of course, the greatest loss of life has come from the war itself and from the bombing, and more than 25,000 civilians have been killed. There is not a single call that President Biden makes, or engagement that anybody in the Biden administration does, that doesn’t put the importance of civilian protection and international humanitarian law, at the top of the conversation,” she said.\nA USAID spokesperson said that “since the start of this conflict, Administrator Power and other Agency leadership have held numerous engagements with staff in the US and at USAID Missions around the world to discuss the US and USAID response to the conflict, offer appreciation for their work, and hear a range of perspectives and concerns.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Os primeiros Jogos realizaram-se em Atenas, no final do século XIX, também como celebração da independência do Império Otomano. Não passariam muitos anos até que, em Berlim, os Jogos se transformassem numa encenação grandiloquente do nazismo (com a cerimónia de abertura a envolver dez mil bailarinos e um coro de três mil vozes). Logo depois da guerra, as Olimpíadas de Londres foram um momento de afirmação dos aliados, excluindo atletas alemães e japoneses e com a autoexclusão da União Soviética. Na década de 60, os Jogos foram instrumentais para legitimar a democracia musculada no México, o que aconteceria mais tarde, de novo, em Seul. Em plena Guerra Fria, Moscovo e Los Angeles foram a materialização desportiva de um mundo às avessas. Mais recentemente, Pequim recebeu as Olimpíadas para credibilizar a sua imagem como potência global. Já em Sóchi, ficou anunciada a brutal afirmação geopolítica da Rússia de hoje, que, pelo caminho, montou um esquema de doping de Estado.",

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 16:55 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 16:32 IST Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings. Conservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies. The pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward. But in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms. Little wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much. \"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state. In the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point. The Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict. Catholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional. Father Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children. He denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church. \"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku. For activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees. \"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said. \"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Now, community members are speaking out with an online petition that already has more than 4,000 signatures in opposition to the pay increase. The petition is spearheaded by former council member Richard Leon. While council agendas are posted online days before a meeting, Leon claims there was a lack of public knowledge about this proposal. \"I was shocked that they had this without discussion, and really just pushed it on their agenda forward,\" said Leon. \"It was a shame because there was no public input or comment, and really no details of what it was and why it was happening.\" Leon has taken his concerns into his own hands by creating the petition in hopes of a change of heart by the council. \"You can't just ask yourselves for a pay raise,\" said Leon. \"You need to you need to get out there, talk to the people, bring them with you give them a reason why to vote for you, and do that. We did that in 2015 actually, we had the voters vote for a pay raise and they did. They doubled our salary.\" Fox 4's Bella Line spoke with Tom Hayden, council member for District 3. He says this stipend will help them complete their duties with what he called fair compensation considering the city's growth in population. Fox 4 asked Hayden if there could be any change to the decision with this petition in mind. \"I don't believe so,\" said Hayden. \"At this point, I mean, the awareness is out there. They have the right to do the petition to collect the names. You know, that's the citizens' right, but I think as a city, it's important for us to move forward to look at the issues that we're facing in 2024.\" Leon says the purpose of the petition is to raise awareness and encourage council members to reconsider.

The attack on Friday killed two and injured 15, including two young children, as [Vladimir Putin](https://metro.co.uk/tag/vladimir-putin/?ico=auto_link_news_P2_LNK1)’s forces [unleashed one of their largest air attacks on several cities](https://metro.co.uk/2023/12/29/russia-unleashes-wave-massive-missile-attacks-across-ukraine-20037347/). Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Odesa were all assaulted on December 29. The blitz has been seen as revenge for [Kyiv’s Storm Shadow strike](https://metro.co.uk/2023/12/26/ukraine-destroys-another-key-russian-warship-fresh-blow-putin-20025157/) on the Novocherkassk large landing ship this week. Across Ukraine, 18 people were killed in the strike and more than 130 were injured. Odesa oblast governor Oleh Kiper reported his city had suffered civilian casualties and heavy damage with two of the wounded in a serious condition. ‘All of the victims are currently receiving help in the city’s medical facilities,’ he told the Kyiv Independent. He said that prior to the missile attack the city had been targeted by a Russian drone strike although all 10 of these had been shot down by defence systems. But despite the adversity, the spirit of the Odesan people was shown in the Christmas tree remaining lit despite everything around it. Sarfaz Akram tweeted: ‘In the face of adversity, the residents of the Odesa apartment complex illuminated a Christmas tree at the heart of the damaged courtyard, symbolising resilience and unity during challenging times.’ Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian ‘terrorists’ had ‘used nearly every type of weapon in [their] arsenal’ in the assault. The Ukrainian president accused them of targeting a maternity hospital, school and residential buildings in the barrage. He said: ‘A total of around 110 missiles were fired against Ukraine, with the majority of them being shot down. ‘Unfortunately, there have been fatalities and injuries as a result of the strikes. My condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. I wish a speedy recovery to those injured. ‘We will surely respond to terrorist strikes. And we will continue to fight for the security of our entire country, every city, and every citizen. Russian terror must and will lose.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at [webnews@metro.co.uk](mailto:webnews@metro.co.uk).

    "text": "Kampala: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar emphasised India's unwavering commitment as \"Vishwa Mitra\" to global solidarity and cooperation in an address at the 19th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Kampala.\nIn India's National Statement at the summit, Jaishankar provided insights into India's extensive contributions, spanning 600 significant projects across 78 nations, with a special focus on Africa, where 300 projects and 45,000 training slots reflect India's commitment and solidarity.\nJaishankar began his address by conveying warm greetings from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the NAM Summit, applauding \"Uganda for taking up the chairship at this crucial juncture. We extend our fullest support for your success.\"\n\"I recognise Azerbaijan for leading NAM during a difficult period. I also welcome South Sudan as a new member,\" he said.\nHighlighting India's global outreach, Jaishankar stated, \"India demonstrates this commitment through 600 significant projects in 78 nations. And each one of them respects the choice of our partners. Insofar as Africa is concerned, 300 projects and 45,000 training slots are an expression of our solidarity.\" This emphasises India's role as a friend to the world, or \"Vishwa Mitra,\" willing to share its expertise and resources for mutual progress.\nThe External Affairs Minister underlined India's proactive response to global challenges, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe noted, \"When COVID struck, we shared vaccines with 100 nations while still vaccinating our own. As natural disasters happen, we have often been first responders for the developing world. In chairing the G20, we chose to convene and draw strength from the Global South.\"\nJaishankar highlighted the changing global landscape since the last NAM Summit in 2019, emphasising the profound impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, ongoing conflicts, and the disruptive nature of climate change. He expressed concern for conflicts worldwide, particularly focusing on Gaza. Addressing broader challenges, he noted, \"The triad of debt, inflation, and growth challenges also weigh heavily on the developing.\"\nUnderlying these challenges, Jaishankar reflected on the evolving nature of the world, where post-colonial struggles have given way to new forms of inequity and domination. He said, \"In the era of globalization, we see economic concentrations that treat the rest of the world as simply markets or resources.\" The minister emphasised the need to recognise and preserve diverse cultures and traditions amid narratives of political correctness and universalism.\nJaishankar also reiterated India's commitment to the NAM principles and its belief in \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,\" emphasising that the world is a family.\nJaishankar arrived in Kampala on Thursday and led the Indian delegation at the two-day 19th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) which began from January 19.\nThe 19th NAM Summit under Uganda's leadership was held under the theme 'Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence' and brings together more than 120 developing countries on a platform of crucial historic significance.\nIndia wholeheartedly supports Uganda's theme for NAM and looks forward to engaging with NAM countries. As one of the leading and founding members of NAM, India remains committed to the principles and values of the movement, a release from the Ministry of External Affairs said.",
