    "title": "Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander declared as Moon’s South Pole location indicator by NASA",
    "text": "Chandrayaan-3, India's ambitious lunar mission's lander, named Vikram is now serving as a location marker on the Moon's South Pole, confirmed NASA.This came after it has been successfully inserted into lunar orbit with an achieved orbit of 164 km x 18074 km. Additionally, the spacecraft was placed into a translunar orbit of 288 km x 369328 km.\nThis was established through a successful experiment conducted on December 12, 2023, at 3 p.m. EST, where NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) transmitted laser pulses towards the lander from a distance of 100 kilometers, near the Manzinus crater. The LRO's laser altimeter instrument detected light reflected back from a small NASA retroreflector aboard Vikram, confirming the lander's precise location.\nThe Vikram lander's role extends beyond its initial mission objectives. It is equipped with a Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA), which is only 5 centimeters wide but serves as a long-term geodetic station and a location marker. This technology is simple, durable, and can last for decades without requiring power or maintenance.\nThe LRA's ability to reflect light coming from any direction back to its source has numerous applications, including aiding in the precise determination of spacecraft orbital positions and refining the lunar geodetic frame. These insights could reveal details about the Moon's dynamics, internal structure, and gravitational anomalies.\nSeveral NASA retroreflectors are poised for deployment on both public and private moon landers, according to an announcement from NASA.\nOne of these retroreflectors is set to be deployed on the SLIM lander operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), scheduled to land on the Moon this Friday. Additionally, Intuitive Machines, a private aerospace company, will carry another retroreflector on its spacecraft, which is expected to launch to the Moon in mid-February.\nThe primary objectives of Chandrayaan-3 include demonstrating a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, rover roving capabilities, and conducting in-situ scientific experiments. On August 23, 2023, Vikram achieved a historic landing near the Moon's South Pole, making India the first nation to reach this region of the Moon. This feat was further highlighted when the Vikram lander kicked up approximately 2.09 tonnes of lunar soil upon touchdown, creating a visible ejecta halo around the landing site.\nAlso Read: Delhi Police arrests man responsible Rashmika Mandanna's deepfake video\nPublished on: Jan 20, 2024, 7:53 PM IST Posted by: Shubham Singh, Jan 20, 2024, 7:37 PM IST IN THIS STORY #Chandrayaan-3 #Vikram Lander #ISRO #Moon #south pole of moon #NASA #location marker Follow Us on Channel TOP STORIES TOP VIDEOS",

    "text": "Elisabeth Braw is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, the author of the award-winning “Goodbye Globalization” and a regular columnist for POLITICO.\nEU diplomat Johan Floderus is now back home in Sweden, and so is Iranian-Swedish dual national Saeed Azizi. Professional basketball player Brittney Griner is safely back in America, while consultant Michael Spavor and diplomat Michael Kovrig are back in Canada.\nYou may be familiar with these names — individuals who were exchanged for a person their state captors wanted released, making headlines across the world over.\nAnd just like them, today every Westerner traveling to a hostile country faces the risk of detention. Still, many travel anyway, knowing their home countries would move mountains to get them free. But that’s a luxury we can no longer afford.\nIndeed, there’s one thing all of us can do to help keep our countries safe: Stay home.\nThe images of Floderus were searing. Seized by Iran while vacationing there two years ago, there he was in an Iranian courtroom, facing a possible death sentence over accusations of espionage. We all wished he’d be able to flee this Kafkaesque nightmare behind. And now, thanks to enormous efforts by the Swedish government, he has.\nSo has Saeed Azizi, an Iranian and naturalized Swede, who was detained by Iran on espionage charges last year. “Iran has made them both pawns in a cynical negotiating game, with the aim of getting Iranian citizen Hamid Noury released from prison in Sweden. He is convicted of grave offenses committed in Iran in the 1980s. As Prime Minister, I bear a special responsibility for the safety of Swedish citizens. The Government has therefore worked intensively on this matter, alongside the Swedish security services who have negotiated with Iran,”\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a statement after the two men were safely returned.\n“It has consistently been apparent that the operation would require some difficult decisions. We have now taken those decisions,” Kristersson added. Those decisions involved r\neleasing Noury, an Iranian official convicted, in Sweden, of executing Iranian political prisoners in the 1980s.\nThe administration of U.S. President Joe Biden went to similar lengths to get Griner released from Russia, where she’d been convicted on drug charges. In fact, the U.S. went so far that it\nagreed to trade her for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. It had taken a years-long undercover operation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to arrest Brout back in 2010, and now, like Noury, he’s a free man again.\nSo is Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, who’d been detained by Canada on a U.S. arrest warrant. Beijing hadn’t liked the arrest one bit, and retaliated by\nseizing two Canadians — Spavor and Kovrig — who happened to be in China at the time.\nLike Moscow and Tehran, Beijing succeeded in its hostage diplomacy and got Meng released in exchange for the two Canadians. Indeed, countries hostile to the West have discovered hostage diplomacy is an immensely useful tool that can help them force Western governments into making otherwise unthinkable concessions.\nWestern capitals are aware of the risk — the problem is they can’t stop their nationals from traveling to dangerous countries. The post-Cold War world of ever-increasing peace and prosperity seemingly taught Westerners they could dash off wherever they liked, and should anything happen to them, their governments would help them get out. (Remember\nthe young Briton who flew to Afghanistan during the West’s chaotic exit and filmed his adventures?)\nSuch a cavalier attitude toward risky countries may have worked when those doing the snatching were criminals, tribal groups and guerillas. But when it’s the governments of major world powers, it becomes an even higher-stakes geopolitical game — one that can cause great harm to Western countries, as the price of their citizens’ release is so high.\nWhat’s more, the concessions Western governments have to make to get their citizens demonstrate they can indeed be blackmailed. Unsurprisingly, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea will continue to exploit this weakness of ours, and other countries could decide to join the hostage diplomacy club.\nWestern governments don’t ask their citizens to do much for their countries. Over the past couple decades, most haven’t even asked young men and women to do national service. But now that Russia and China have dramatically demonstrated they aren’t above hostage diplomacy, it’s time for Western citizens to do something for their countries.\nThat something is an extremely simple act that will make a noticeable contribution to their countries’ safety: stay put or go somewhere safe.\nThere are plenty of places one can visit — including exotic non-Western ones – but there’s absolutely no need for most of us to visit hostile countries that practice hostage diplomacy. The situation currently faced by the Swedish government illustrates the severity of the risk: Despite looming war in Lebanon, some\n5,000 Swedes and dual nationals are planning to travel there this summer, and some 2,000 are already there.\nMindbogglingly, several hundred Swedes and dual nationals are even planning trips to Iran over the summer.\nYes, many Westerners do extremely courageous work in dangerous parts of the world — just think of the nuns still operating schools in Haiti. These individuals deserve protection. The rest of us, though, should do a good deed and stay home.\nThe post\nDo a good deed for your country — stay home appeared first on Politico.",

    "text": "ATLANTA — Digital access for families can open many doors to education, business and other essential aspects of everyday life. However, without a personal computer at home, that access can be limited.\nThat’s why several organizations in Atlanta are stepping up to help bridge the digital gap while also providing comfort to Atlanta families.\nThis year, the [Food in the City Foundation](/article/life/holidays/food-in-the-city-early-thanksgiving-meals-atlanta/85-8ef08125-0ced-49a9-bbb0-c4f886791a39) is once again hosting a holiday giveaway. For the first time, the foundation is partnering with [Compudopt](https://www.compudopt.org/computergiveaway?gclid=Cj0KCQiAu8W6BhC-ARIsACEQoDBo5xY9uVks8w5DPxO9gxFeZc2em7fo2ez9Y7BBFUKVg6tEU9YROFAaAn7FEALw_wcB) to give 500 families brand-new laptops.\n“We get to partner with Fortune 500 companies, being small, Black-owned businesses, and getting to make a real impact in the community. You can't pay for that,” said Jakeem Smith, founder of the Food in the City Foundation.\nSmith is joining others like Derrick Hayes, the founder of [Big Dave’s Cheesesteaks,](/article/news/local/big-daves-cheesesteaks-new-location-downtown-atlanta-flagship-restaurant/85-10c8655a-348b-43ee-b467-fb944f158c34) for the giveaway on Monday, Dec. 9.\nIn addition to computers, the foundation is partnering with companies like Ashley Furniture, Amazon, Pepsi, AT&T, [Smoot Films](https://www.smootfilms.com/) and others to provide much-needed resources for Atlanta families.\nDerrick Hayes will be there providing meals. The Big Dave's Cheesesteaks founder told 11Alive that the community has to put more focus on helping lift people up, especially those who have climbed themselves.\n“As you climb, you have to lift,” Hayes said. “You can't be the guy that's actually having good things come to you, and you don't put other people in a good position.\"\nHayes added that many children do not have the resources they need.\n\"You know, we could point the finger and say what they're doing and what they're not doing, but what are we doing to change that? And I think right now, this shows what we are doing,” Hayes continued.\nThose interested in attending the giveaway must register with the Food in the City Organization online. Once registered, Smith said that families will receive the location for the Dec. 9 event. To register, [click here](https://foodinthecityatl.com/).",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "title": "Tired Tottenham’s off night ‘understandable’ – Ange Postecoglou",
    "text": "Ange Postecoglou defended his “tired” Tottenham team after they were blown away in a six-goal thriller at Brighton.\nJoao Pedro struck a brace of penalties while Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan produced fine strikes in a well deserved 4-2 victory for Roberto De Zerbi’s men.\nWhile Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies scored in the final 10 minutes, Spurs were second best for much of the night and suffered a fifth Premier League defeat of the campaign.\nBoth clubs have faced numerous injuries during recent months, with Brighton without eight players for this contest and Tottenham nine, which led to Postecoglou taking a philosophical view.\nPostecoglou said: “Fair to say we were looking a bit tired and lacked our usual sharpness, especially at the start of the game. We’ve been starting games well.\n“I guess that’s understandable, we’ve been on this run for a while now and asking players to perform at levels. It’s very demanding the way we play, physically, and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn’t at its sharpest.\n“Brighton are a good side and they took advantage of that. Ultimately what I do know is the players, everything they had they gave and that’s all I can ask for.”\nPedro found the unmarked Hinshelwood to fire beyond Guglielmo Vicario, who had twice denied Danny Welbeck early on, and the Brazilian then rolled home a spot-kick after Dejan Kulusevski was penalised for pulling Welbeck.\nVicario was forced into action several more times, while James Milner also hit the post before Estupinan capped his comeback appearance with a goal from 25 yards.\nThe offside flag had denied Richarlison twice but Spurs’ miserable night was compounded when substitute Giovani Lo Celso brought down Evan Ferguson and Pedro slotted home to make it 4-0.\nTottenham fought back with Veliz scoring his first goal in English football with nine minutes left before Ben Davies headed home at the back post, but it finished 4-2.\nPostecoglou had no qualms with either penalty decision, although did take umbrage with VAR not punishing Brighton captain Lewis Dunk for a poor tackle on Kulusevski in the build-up to Veliz scoring.\n“It was obviously clear and obvious because it only took him (Jarred Gillett) three minutes to see it on the screen, and VAR picked up everything today except the one tackle which nearly cost me another player,” Postecoglou added.\n“It’s been difficult this whole run. We’ve been stretched for a very long time and we’ve just tried to play on through it.\n“We’re only in the position we are because of the enormous efforts of the players to do jobs that normally is not in their brief, but they do it willingly and they give everything. Today we fell short but not for the want of trying.”\nDe Zerbi toasted a brilliant end to a special year where Brighton finished sixth, made the FA Cup semi-finals and progressed into the last 16 of the Europa League.\n“Yes, the best way to finish the year,” he added.\n“We played a great game because we show incredible courage to defend men-to-men for 90 minutes and to play with that courage, that quality, that style.\n“I am sorry we concede two goals and I am sorry we have no clean sheet.”\nComments: Our rules\nWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "title": "Optimism Matters 11/07/2024",
    "text": "by Dave Morgan , Featured Contributor, 5 hours ago I am an optimist who firmly believes in the power of optimism. I also know that being an optimist is not always easy -- and for some situations, being an optimist can seem downright impossible.\nThat’s why I turned to my good friend Bill Burke to be the keynote speaker of my company’s leadership offsite earlier this year. Many of you know Bill from his days as the founding general manager of Turner Classic Movies, former president of TBS, the former CEO of The Weather Channel, the president of the Portland Sea Dogs AA baseball team, or from the book he co-wrote with Ted Turner, “Call Me Ted.”\nBut Bill has now embarked on an incredibly important mission, helping people be more optimistic as the founder and CEO of The Optimism Institute, the outgrowth of a year-long Advanced Leadership Fellowship that he and his wife Karen recently completed at Harvard.\nThere is a paradox in modern optimism, Bill told us: “On one hand, this is the greatest time in the history of the world to be alive. But, on the other hand, there has never been a more difficult time to be an optimist.”\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nPeople across the world live longer, healthier lives than ever before. Standards of living are up across the board around the world. Childhood death rates are down dramatically. More people in the world receive more education than ever before. More people live in democratic nations, earn more money, can buy more essentials, can travel and pursue happiness.\nBut we also now live an era of constant connectedness, where every piece of bad news happening anywhere in the world is delivered in real time to your palm, desktop or TV, and where social platforms’ personalization algorithms optimize the delivery of content that incites the greatest emotional response (bad more than good, it seems), rather than necessarily the greatest information value.\nRapid change, social anxiety and complexity instill fear or flight in people, all making it hard for them to be optimistic. But why does being optimistic matter?\nBill explained that research shows optimists are happier. They see things more positively and are thus more energized to cope with obstacles. They sleep better, have stronger immune function and better cardiovascular health. They are more resilient, since optimism strengthens us to keep our goals in place and keep trying.\nWe asked Bill if optimism can be developed, or if it’s just something you’re born with. He offered us a number of techniques to help improve optimism:\nNotice good things. See the kind acts of others: the person opening a door for another, or giving directions to a stranger. They are all around us. Train yourself to see them. It’s like when you’re shopping for a new car, and suddenly you see them all around you.\nStop worrying about things you can’t affect. We’re now aware of so many things happening around the world, many of them tragedies. They make you sad. As the Stoics have thought for millennia, we need to learn not to spend our time and anxiety on those things beyond our control.\nSpend less time on social media. Stop giving so much control of your headspace to Big Tech companies abusing your attention and emotions. Take it back for better purposes, like time with your friends, family or helping others.\nRead more history. Tough things happening today aren’t nearly as bad as some portray them relative to human history. How many commentators and posts are telling us (or screaming at us) every day that “the United States has never been so divided”? Maybe it’s a good time to read about the U.S. Civil War and the 620,000 soldiers on both sides who were killed in the four years of horrific fighting and devastation.\nListen t o “ Blue Sky .” It’s Bill Burke’s weekly podcast. The stories are amazing.\nStill need convincing? Just watch the Olympics for a few hours. You can’t help but be moved by images like the young French swimmer hugging half of the spectators in the swimming arena after his gold medal win, or the American steeplechase runner coming from last to win silver and beat his personal best time by 10 seconds! Or the incomparable Simone Biles and her teammate paying homage on the podium to the gold medal winner from Brazil.\nIn closing, Bill posed a simple question to us: The history books are full of the amazing feats of great optimists. Can you name some amazing accomplishments of great pessimists?\nThis post was previously published in an earlier edition of Media Insider.",
