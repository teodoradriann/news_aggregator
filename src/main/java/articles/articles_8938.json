    "title": "MBARI Introduces New MOLA AUV to Make Ocean Exploration More Accessible",
    "text": "The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has developed a portable autonomous robot primed to study marine environments.\nThe multimodality, observing, low-cost, agile autonomous underwater vehicle (MOLA AUV) features advanced sensors to survey marine ecosystems. MBARI engineers hope the broader marine science community will benefit from the MOLA AUV’s open-source design specifications and software algorithms.\nMBARI envisions a fleet of nimble robots gathering data to help guide decision-making about the ocean and its resources.\nAccording to Principal Engineer Giancarlo Troni , who leads MBARI’s Control, Modeling and Perception of Autonomous Systems Laboratory , known as the CoMPAS Lab :\n“The ocean is critical for all life on earth. We urgently need to understand our changing ocean, but there are many barriers to ocean exploration. MBARI has been developing a versatile and portable robot that is capable of taking high-resolution measurements of seafloor terrain over large areas. We hope this tool expands access to and monitoring of ocean life and ecosystems.”\nCoMPAS Lab scientists and engineers spent 18 months developing the MOLA AUV . Measuring 45 centimeters (18 inches) wide and 72 centimeters (28 inches) long and weighing 30 kilograms (66 pounds) , the robot is the latest of MBARI’s work to create smaller, more nimble platforms for ocean research.\nWhile robust platforms like the Dorado-class AUVs remain invaluable to MBARI’s work, their large size requires substantial resources for deployment. Similar to MBARI’s long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV), the MOLA AUV can be deployed with a limited crew, either from a small boat or even from shore.\nAt the core of the MOLA AUV is a commercially available Boxfish submersible , built to the CoMPAS Lab’s specifications and enhanced with custom instruments and sensors developed by MBARI engineers. The MOLA AUV is equipped with a 4K camera to record high-resolution video of marine life and habitats. Sonar systems use acoustics to ensure the vehicle can consistently “see” 30 meters (100 feet) ahead and work in tandem with stereo cameras that take detailed imagery of the ocean floor.\nLeveraging methods developed by the CoMPAS Lab, the vehicle’s six degrees of freedom enable it to move and rotate in any direction efficiently. This agility and portability set the MOLA AUV apart from other underwater vehicles and allow it to leverage software algorithms developed at MBARI to create three-dimensional photo reconstructions of seafloor environments.\nThe CoMPAS Lab plans to deploy the MOLA AUV for seafloor mapping missions . Previous mapping methods used sonar mounted on ships, but the distance between the ocean surface and the seafloor resulted in low-resolution data.\nThe MOLA AUV can travel closer to the seafloor and visualize the terrain below in much greater detail, especially in rough terrain — imagine the difference between a picture taken a mile away and an up-close shot. The higher-resolution images will enable the team to create a searchable map of the ocean floor.\nSoftware Engineer Kevin Barnard said:\n“GPS doesn’t work underwater, which makes mapping more difficult in the ocean than on land. To overcome this challenge, we’re developing sensors and software that allow us to navigate through many locations and see how they all fit together. We can then use that data to return to specific sites and track changes over time.”",

    "text": "The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly five months amid gathering hopes that the UK will avoid a recession.\nSterling climbed to $1.2827, its strongest since August 1, before giving up the gains later in the session.\nIt comes as analysts see further gains for sterling against the dollar next year, with experts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $1.35.\nThat would be a far cry from the aftermath of last year’s mini-Budget when sterling hit a record low of less than $1.04.\nThe pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve looks closer to pulling the trigger on interest rate cuts next year.\nOn the charge: The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on interest rate cuts next year\nMarkets are also looking ahead to next year’s Budget after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would take place on March 6.\nAnd a survey of 52 economists by Bloomberg suggested that the UK was heading for a so-called ‘soft landing’ in which inflation is brought down without causing a downturn.\nThey predicted that after a bumpy start to next year, GDP would grow by 0.3 per cent as consumers enjoy lower inflation, bringing an end to the cost of living crisis.\nBut the Bank of England predicts that growth will flatline in 2024.\nThe report was not entirely positive, with a third forecasting that the economy will have shrunk in the fourth quarter of this year.\nThat would imply a recession – defined as two quarters in a row of contraction – as GDP has already shrunk by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter.\nDan Hanson, at Bloomberg Economics, said the economy will ‘tread a fine line between stagnation and contraction in the first half’ of 2024.",

    "text": "Este fin de semana la Península de Yucatán registrará temperaturas máximas de 44 grados centígrados, principalmente en la capital del Estado de Yucatán, Mérida, que tendrá desde este viernes hasta el domingo una temperatura promedio de entre los 43 y 44 grados, mientras que la sensación térmica superará los 50 grados, acorde a los pronósticos del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional. Por su parte, el Estado de Quintana Roo tendrá temperaturas en la mayor parte de su territorio que llegarán hasta un máximo de 41 grados, principalmente el sábado y domingo y mantenida durante la siguiente semana, en este año que se pronostica tan caluroso como el 2023, marcado como el año de más calor este siglo. Un informe de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM), precisa que la temperatura media de 2023 estuvo 0,82 grados centígrados por encima de la media del período 1991-2020 y que México fue el país con el ritmo de calentamiento más rápido de la región: 0,3 °C por decenio, entre 1991 y 2023, alcanzando un registro de 51,4 °C en el norte del territorio nacional. Los modelos meteorológicos señalan que estas temperaturas se mantendrán en las siguientes semanas, aunque se estima también se puedan dar algunas lluvias que puedan mitigar esta ola de calor que a afectado a todos los estados que integran la Península de Yucatán, y que posiciona a Mérida en el tercer lugar de los sitios más calurosos del país. Por otra parte, se estima que la Canícula, conocida por ser la temporada más calurosa del año, inicie, por adelantado, a partir del 3 de julio y concluya el 11 de agosto, periodo de 40 días que se estima pueda traer temperaturas de 45 a 46 grados centígrados, lo que provocará un estado crítico para ciertos sectores de la población. Las autoridades de los tres niveles han emitido recomendaciones a la comunidad a fin de mantener hidratados y con baja exposición a los rayos del sol, utilizar bloqueador solar y poner especial atención a niño, adultos mayores y mascotas. Mientras, protectores de animales sugieren colocar depósitos con agua en zonas de sombra para los perros y gatos en situación de calle.",

    "title": "ESA GEO SATELLITE OPPORTUNITY INCLUDES NORTH AMERICA",
    "text": "Thanks to Ron @W6RZ for first posting the AMSAT-UK presentation video on QRZ Sat forum today. IMO this is quite encouraging and exciting news. Apparently despite persistent naysayers to the contrary there are some open minded, optimistic, and competent radio amateurs in positions of influence that are making progress with this idea. As an American it ought to be agitating that visible leadership for this comes from elsewhere. I especially appreciated the first slide that outlines innovations radio amateurs have contributed to the art of satellite communications. Hope you enjoy watching and reading more about it. 73, John, WØPV ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY GEO SATELLITE OPPORTUNITY At the recent RSGB Convention / AMSAT-UK Colloquium at Milton Keynes, Frank Zeppenfeldt, PD0AP, from the European Space Agency Satellite Communications Group, made a presentation on the subject of a future ESA backed amateur satellite mission to GEO. Frank has obtained funding of 250,000 Euro to investigate the possibility of an Amateur satellite or payload to be placed in GEO orbit. The presentation emphasises innovation and microwave communications. Franks full presentation is available on YouTube and here at the AMSAT-DL colloquium: As a member of the UK microwave / Satellite community, we would like to invite you to contribute to the design concept of this mission. We would welcome any thoughts you may have via e-mail etc and we will add those to the overall discussion. In a follow up Teams meeting on Wed 1st Nov between Frank and AMSAT-UK, it became clear that an ideal solution from an ESA perspective should provide a service to amateurs in Canada as well as Europe. - Canada is an ESA co-operating state. Note that any GEO covering part or all of Canada will also cover a significant proportion of The USA. AMSAT-UK is working to identify a suitable range of GEO slots which meet this requirement. What is needed, is a proposal for 2 or 3 ideas for what this GEO mission (most likely a hosted payload) should include. See notes / Franks presentation. AMSAT-UK aims to respond with some proposals by Dec 4th. These do not need great detail, but should justify bands used and other ideas. For Example. What bands should be included. - This project is not aimed as a QO-100 replacement. Is 24G and up practical? Can a ground station generate enough power economically with today's available technology for an uplink on 24/47/76G Given a resource in space, is there an 'easy' entry level on say 24G - RX or TX so we can attract new microwave operators. Should the transponder/s be old style bent pipe configurations or contain on board processing to decode RX signals then encode the downlink? What digital protocols are appropriate for the above? Is 5.6G viable as an uplink given the WiFi presence? Any observations on 6cm interference would be valuable. Note: The antennas on the satellite will likely have a min gain of 20dB as this covers the visible portion of the Earth from geostationary orbit. In recent discussions with BATC etc we have concluded that a 10G downlink should be the baseline to take advantage of the large existing userbase and that a minimum power output onboard needs to be 10W into a 20dB antenna. If the proposals are considered substantial enough for further discussion, we have suggested a meeting at the ESA technical centre in The Netherlands around end Feb / March next year. This 2 day (?) event would be funded by ESA probably via A-UK. If this meeting happens, then representatives from A-UK BATC and UK microwave group could attend along with other groups from The EU and USA so we can take the project forward. Frank anticipates doing some initial prototyping and then present the findings to a meeting of GEO platform operators next year. Hopefully this will find a commercial partner with a platform going to an appropriate GEO slot. If any of this is of interest, please let us know your thoughts. This is a rare opportunity. I hope you can give it your support. Regards David G0MRF / Noel G8GTZ Comment Nov 19th 2023 - We would like to engage in this conversation and will contact David G0MRF and others since we just incorporated AMSAT-CA (Amateur Radio Satellites and Systems - Canada). More news on this to follow soon !!!!! - VE4SW",

    "text": "As we live out the Christian life and cooperate with the Holy Spirit through the precious means of grace, we face a number of foes, a number of enemies that mean to derail us from our pursuit of God. Of all those enemies, none may be more prevalent and none more deadly than complacency.\nIf it is humility that keeps us from thinking we have somehow risen above those ordinary means, complacency is that all-too-familiar satisfaction with our own accomplishments. It is that feeling, that conviction even, that we have done enough, that we have done more than enough, that we can now relax our pursuit of God. Yet what God said to Isaiah, he says to us: “This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word” (Isaiah 66:2).\nHumility calls us to assess ourselves rightly as remaining so needy and so incomplete, while contrition calls us to be remorseful for how little we truly know of God and how full of sin we still are. Together they call us to commit ourselves to God and to his Word, to tremble before him and to forever desire him. As Tozer so presciently warns, “complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth.”",
