    "text": "Please enable JavaScript to read this content.\nThe health sector in the country is headed for the dogs after the Kenya Union for Clinical Officers (KUCO) issued a three-week notice over the failure by the government to include them in the rollout of the troubled Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF).\nThe union has said that from December 23, over 30,000 of its members will down their tools over continued discrimination by the Social Health Authority (SHA).\nThe move comes a day after the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) called on all intern doctors to [withdraw](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001507131/kmpdu-warns-of-health-services-shutdown-in-december) their services from December over job frustrations.\nIn the latest incident, the clinical officers accused the Social Health Authority of locking them out of the provision of services for ulterior motives.\nAccording to the Union national chairperson Peterson Wachira, top officials from the authority were to blame for the current crisis that had affected over 6m Kenyans.\nWachira noted that the new SHA board had blocked clinicians from the list of service providers yet they operated over 1,000 private facilities in the country.\n“We shall down tools on the 23rd of December if the board does not rescind its decision and we shall be holding demonstrations every Monday to protest this discrimination,” he said.\nAddressing the press in Naivasha where the union was holding its AGM, Wachira noted that the crisis started once the SHIF came into force.\nFlanked by the union officials, he warned that the health sector could collapse due to poor management by senior officers from SHA who had introduced a new funding model.\n“The President has promised that the Universal Health Cover should work but this can’t work over the manner that the Social Health Authority is carrying out the rollout,” he said.\nOn his part, Antony Kariga, an eye surgeon from Nakuru said that over 80 percent of patients in need of eye operations could not get the services.\n“The Social Health Authority has blocked us from offering these services and this has seen tens of operations put on hold,” he said.\nThis was echoed by James Nderitu, an anesthetist who said that they could no longer seek pre-authorization before conducting their services as was the case before.\n“The new directives from the Social Health Authority are hurting patients across the country and hence the need for fresh engagement,” he said.\nA dermatologist Austin Odour termed the move by SHA to remove clinical officers from the list of service providers as questionable and inhuman.\nStay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter\n“There are five registered dermatologists in the country against millions of people seeking skin care treatment and we wonder how they will work following the new rules by SHA,” he said.\nEnds.",

    "title": "Local Teamsters unions in swing states rush to endorse Harris - The Washington Post",
    "text": "A wave of local and regional Teamsters union branches in battleground states rushed to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris after the national Teamsters union declared that it would not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly three decades. Separately, powerful local Teamsters unions in Philadelphia; New York City; Long Beach, Calif.; and Miami — as well as the union’s National Black Caucus and a group of retirees — have endorsed Harris and urged members to vote for her. “Both Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz have consistently demonstrated their dedication to championing the labor movement,” Kevin D. Moore, president of Teamsters Joint Council 43, which represents some 245,000 members and retirees in Michigan, wrote in a letter Wednesday announcing the endorsement. He urged “all Teamsters members … to lend their support to this outstanding campaign.” The Teamsters endorsements have drawn intense scrutiny because the union has a strong presence in battleground states — and unions have an unusual ability to mobilize their memberships. Some Democratic strategists say the outpouring of local endorsements for Harris could be more important in influencing how Teamsters turn out to vote than the national union’s decision to abstain. Local unions typically mobilize members directly through workplace conversations, door-knocking, leafleting and mailers. “Union members don’t follow endorsements. They follow programs of political action, which are based in their workplaces and local unions,” said Larry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America union and a Democratic operative working on voter turnout. Still, the national union’s lack of an endorsement marks a blow to the Harris campaign, some strategists said, in light of the current administration’s many achievements for unions. It also gives former president Donald Trump and his allies new ammunition to tout union members — who traditionally lean Democrat — as among his supporters. At a rally in Uniondale, N.Y., on Wednesday night, Trump thanked O’Brien and Teamsters members across the country. “Because this was a surprise,” he said. “It’s automatic they endorse the Democrats.” Elon Musk took to his social media platform X on Wednesday to share a post from a right-wing account with polling results of Teamsters membership that showed Trump leading Harris by a significant margin. That post said, “Without support from union members, Democrats are toast. This is major.” The Teamsters released results from two internal surveys of members that they say show rank-and-file members strongly favored a Trump endorsement over one for Harris. The Teamsters reported the periods during which the polls were conducted, whether they were conducted by phone or online, and the percentages that supported Trump and Harris. But the Teamsters did not disclose how participants were selected for the surveys, the number of people who completed them, whether the samples were weighted by demographics, or the exact questions they asked. The Teamsters said these surveys influenced their decision to not endorse. However, a chorus of union leaders and political strategists questioned them and their methodologies, as no details were released. The Washington Post has also inquired about the methodologies. A national Fox News poll of registered voters conducted in mid-September found Harris with 53 percent support to Trump’s 47 percent among union households, within the poll’s margin of error. In 2020, Joe Biden led Trump with voters in union households by 56 to 40 percent, according to media exit polls. Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic political strategist in the labor movement for decades, said the Teamsters’ non-endorsement “allows Trump to say, ‘Union members support me. It’s just union leaders that don’t,’ which isn’t the case. You see lots of polls that bear that out.” The Teamsters have endorsed the Democratic ticket in every presidential election since 1996, when they did not endorse a candidate. The union had closer ties to the GOP decades ago, endorsing presidents Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The Teamsters’ non-endorsement also reflects a major chasm within the union. Some labor experts say O’Brien has adopted a more bipartisan approach under pressure to consider the membership’s diverse political leanings. He ascended to the union’s top office in 2021 after running as a reform candidate who promised more member involvement in union decision-making. O’Brien is also aware that many rank-and-file Teamsters are Trump supporters, experts say. The union met behind closed doors with Harris on Monday, and earlier this year with President Biden. O’Brien met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in January and held a roundtable with the former president at the union’s headquarters. He also addressed the Republican National Convention in July, becoming the first union president to do so — outraging Democrats, who felt betrayed in light of the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to champion labor. The budding relationship with Trump also spurred backlash from liberal Teamsters leadership and many rank-and-file members. After the conventions, a growing cohort of Teamsters local unions began issuing endorsements for Harris, and in some cases condemning O’Brien for not endorsing her. As of Thursday, at least eight regional councils, covering active Teamsters members in some 14 states, as well as 10 union locals, had endorsed Harris. The regional councils alone represent more than 500,000 Teamsters members. No regional or local Teamsters organizations have endorsed Trump.

    "text": "By Paul Vieira\nOTTAWA--The U.K. said on Thursday it would pause negotiations with Canada on a comprehensive liberalized-trade treaty, citing a lack of progress. Canada said talks stalled over agriculture, and British reluctance to increase market access for the Canadian agrifood sector.\n\"We reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made,\" according to a statement from the U.K. government, published on the social-media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, by the High Commissioner to Canada. The statement added that the U.K. would be willing to restart talks with Canada, so long as it benefits businesses and consumers \"on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nThe statement didn't elaborate on why talks, launched in March 2022, broke down. A spokesman at the U.K. High Commission in Ottawa declined further comment.\nMeanwhile, a spokeswoman for Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said Britain's decision to \"maintain market-access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.\"\nThe spokeswoman added Canada is confident that a deal can eventually be reached.\nCanadian agrifood groups, such as the Canadian Pork Council, had testified before lawmakers last year that what was being proposed in talks between London and Ottawa wouldn't increase access for their products in the British market. Meanwhile, Britain was seeking increased access in Canada for its domestic cheese producers.\nIn November 2020, to much fanfare, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former U.K. leader Boris Johnson announced an interim trade pact to take effect in 2021, once Britain was no longer part of a European Union-Canada trade treaty. At that time, Trudeau and U.K. officials pledged to work toward a more comprehensive trade agreement.\nCanadian government data covering 2022 indicate that the U.K. was Canada's third-largest trading partner, with trade in goods and services valued at 46.5 billion Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of US$34.4 billion.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n01-25-24 1653ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",

    "title": "Blake Lively: critican su look en la premier de Another Simple Favor - Nueva Mujer",
    "text": "Durante años, Blake Lively fue el epítome del glamour en Hollywood: actriz adorada, ícono de estilo y esposa del “hombre perfecto” Ryan Reynolds. Pero en cuestión de meses, la estrella de Gossip Girl ha pasado de ser la favorita del público a convertirse en una de las celebridades más criticadas en redes sociales. Entre una polémica batalla legal, rumores de enemistad con colegas, y ahora, un vergonzoso “incidente” en la alfombra roja, el internet no la perdona.\nPUBLICIDAD\nUn vestido de ensueño arruinado por un error\nTodo ocurrió en la premiere de Another Simple Favor, la esperada secuela protagonizada por Lively y Anna Kendrick, en Nueva York. Blake apareció en la alfombra con un espectacular vestido azul celeste con cortes estratégicos que la hacían parecer salida de un cuento de hadas. Su peinado, maquillaje y joyería estaban en total sincronía con el look. Hasta que… los fans notaron un detalle que lo arruinó todo: manchas marrones bajo los brazos, producto de un error con el body makeup o el spray tan.\n“Qué asco”. “Fail total ese look”. “Su maquillista, su peor enemigo”. “Se ve asqueroso eso”. “No puedo dejar de ver eso”, escribieron internautas. Aunque algunos fans salieron en su defensa (“¡Es perfecta, incluso con manchas!”), la mayoría aprovechó para desatar una lluvia de críticas... y burlas.\nBlake Lively: entre peleas, demandas y enemistades en el set\nEste pequeño desliz no llega en el mejor momento para Lively. Su nombre lleva meses sonando por razones que poco tienen que ver con su talento. Todo comenzó con su participación en It Ends With Us, cinta dirigida y coprotagonizada por Justin Baldoni, con quien ahora enfrenta una compleja batalla legal. Blake lo acusa de acoso sexual, mientras que él ha contraatacado con demandas por difamación y extorsión. El caso, que irá a juicio en 2026, ha dividido a la industria… y a los fans.\nLa tensión también salpicó su relación con Anna Kendrick, su compañera en Another Simple Favor. Aunque ambas posaron sonrientes en la premiere, desde hace meses se rumora que hay mala sangre entre ellas. Un video viral de SXSW mostró a Kendrick esquivando preguntas sobre su relación con Blake con un frío “Oh, ya sabes…”, avivando aún más los rumores de enemistad.\nTIME100: un homenaje eclipsado por las sombras del pasado\nY como si fuera poco, la reciente inclusión de Lively en la lista TIME100, que la reconoce como una de las personas más influyentes del mundo, también fue motivo de controversia. Durante la gala, ofreció un emotivo discurso en el que habló por primera vez del intento de asesinato que sufrió su madre antes de que ella naciera. Su intención fue clara: usar su visibilidad para hablar de supervivencia y resiliencia.\nPero el público no olvidó sus errores pasados: desde su boda en una plantación hasta sus críticas a colegas. “¿Esto es una broma?”, “Pagó por ese lugar, seguro” y “Blake Lively siendo 100 veces insoportable”, fueron algunas de las frases más repetidas en redes tras su participación.\nAun así, Lively agradeció a la activista Sherrilyn Ifill por escribir su semblanza para TIME y reafirmó su compromiso con las causas sociales. Sin embargo, para muchos, su figura ya no inspira. El brillo que una vez la rodeaba hoy parece teñido de escándalos, manchas… y mucha polémica.",

    "title": "Bringing Books to Life: In-Person Events Spark Joy and Learning in February",
    "text": "This February, the literary world buzzed with excitement as in-person events made a significant comeback, highlighting the crucial role of literature in education and community building. From engaging book club meetings to insightful school visits and celebratory book launches, the stories of authors, literary agents, and educators came together to foster a love for reading and highlight the importance of representation in children's literature.\nRekindling Community Connections Through Literature\nOn February 25, Mr. Mopps' Children's Books in Berkeley, California, became a vibrant meeting spot for the Picture Book Club, an initiative led by Chronicle editor Melissa Manlove. Transitioning from virtual Zoom sessions to a much-anticipated in-person gathering, the club's members, including Sandra Salsbury, Annie Barrows, and literary agent Danielle Svetcov, shared their favorite picture books. This event not only showcased the diverse tastes and interests of the book club members but also underscored the importance of community and professional networking in the publishing industry.\nEducational Impact: Authors Engage with Young Minds\nOn February 23, Rehoboth Elementary School in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, welcomed author Michelle Meadows, who presented her new picture book biography, Jimmy's Rhythm & Blues: The Extraordinary Life of James Baldwin. Meadows' visit provided a unique opportunity for fifth graders to delve into Baldwin's life, from his upbringing in Harlem to his career as a writer and poet, emphasizing the power of storytelling in education. Similarly, Kamilla Benko's presentation of The Unicorn Legacy: Tangled Magic at Hawthorne Scholastic Academy in Chicago offered students a glimpse into the world of fantasy literature, further supported by local bookstore the Book Cellar.\nHighlighting Representation in Children's Literature\nOn February 5, Hena Khan's book launch for Drawing Deena at Scrawl Books in Reston, Virginia, turned into a meaningful discussion about Muslim representation in children's literature. In conversation with picture book author Saira Mir, Khan explored the challenges and successes of incorporating diverse cultural backgrounds into stories for young readers. This event not only celebrated Khan's latest work but also sparked conversations around diversity and inclusion in the literary world.\nThese February events illustrate the vibrant connections between literature and its audiences, highlighting the importance of in-person interactions in fostering a love for reading and learning. From educational visits that bring authors and students together to discussions on representation and inclusivity, this month's literary activities underscore the ongoing efforts to enrich the literary landscape for readers of all ages. As we move forward, these events serve as a reminder of literature's power to connect, educate, and inspire.",
