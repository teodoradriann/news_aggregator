    "title": "Setback to Ruling Cong in Karnataka as Temple Bill Defeated in Legislative Council",
    "text": "Bengaluru: In a setback to the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024, that sought to collect funds from temples with over Rs 10 lakh annual income, was defeated by the opposition BJP-JD(S) combine in the Legislative Council on Friday. The bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly prior to this week, which was defeated by a voice vote in Rajya Sabha, whereas the opposition has a majority. It proposes to collect five percent from temples whose gross income is between Rs 10 lakh and less than Rs one crore and 10 percent from temples whose income is above Rs one crore, to be put into a Common Pool Fund, administered by 'Rajya Dharmika Parishath', which is proposed to be used for Archakas' (priests) welfare and upkeep of 'C' category temples (state-controlled) whose annual income is less than Rs five lakh. Earlier, the act was amended in 2011 to make way for five percent of the net income of temples with annual income between Rs five lakh and Rs 10 lakh and 10 percent of the net income of temples with annual income over Rs 10 lakh to come to the fund. The amendment bill had caused a massive dispute as it angered the opposition, especially the BJP, which charged the ruling Congress with trying to fill its 'empty coffers' with temple money, while the Congress had sought to turn the tables, saying the saffron party had effected an amendment in 2011 to seek funds from high-income Hindu shrines. Leader of the Opposition in Council Kota Srinivas Poojary, who was the Muzrai Minister during the BJP government, while welcoming the move to provide social security to Archakas, opposed diversion of the revenue earned by temples. He questioned why the government can't provide funds in the budget for their welfare. The opposition also opposed the proposal in the bill for the nomination of the temple committee president by the government. Muzrai Minister Ramalinga Reddy, trying to convince the opposition, assured the House that the government would not interfere in the nomination of the temple committee president and also reduce the amount proposed to be diverted from the temples to the common pool. Highlighting that the bill only proposes minor changes to what the BJP government had proposed in 2011, he said the intention is the welfare of Archakas at 'C' category temples and the upkeep of such temples. As the opposition insisted that changes be made to the bill before it is passed, Reddy sought time until Monday as he needed to discuss it with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as it involves financial implications. However, the Deputy Chairman, M K Pranesh, who was in the Chair, did not give time until Monday, stating that there is no such provision as the House has already taken up the bill for consideration. The bill was subsequently put to vote, and it was defeated by the opposition BJP-JD(S) combine. This is the second such setback to the Congress government in this session, as the BJP and JD(S) combined had referred the Karnataka Souharda Cooperative (Amendment) Bill 2024 to the select committee earlier this week.

L'enorme tartaruga è stata avvistata in difficoltà da Emanuele Aprile Borriello e da tutto l'equipaggio della barca Dbb che dopo aver allertato lo staff del pronto soccorso tartarughe marine a Filicudi diretto dalla biologa Monica Blasi e la motovedetta della guardia costiera è riuscito a liberare l'esemplare prima del loro arrivo. «Complimenti per questa grande impresa – ha commentato Monica Blasi, presidente di Filicudi Conservation - erano 6 anni che non avvistavamo una tartaruga liuto nelle acque Eoliane per un totale, con questo, di 4 avvistamenti in 20 anni di attività di recupero alle Eolie. Questa specie è presente nel Mediterraneo anche se non si riproduce lungo le sue coste prediligendo le zone oceaniche e di mare aperto dove si nutre principalmente di zooplancton e meduse, raramente di crostacei ed echinodermi. È tra le specie di tartarughe marine nel mondo più minacciate proprio a causa dell'inquinamento dei mari, l'intrappolamento e l'ingestione di plastica e in altri rifiuti antropici». Sui social invece è diventato virale un video che ha scatenato emozioni e applausi del delfino che ringrazia dopo essere stato liberato. Foto notiziarioeolie.it",

    "text": "Leipheimer's Growler gran fondo adds pro race, luring top riders to 'majestic' route $20,000 prize purse for top men and women 136-mile Sonoma County event compared to Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Il Lombardia New on the North American racing scene for 2024 is a one-day race worthy of comparisons to European spring Classics, with big climbs, big ‘character’ and a big pay day. The Growler will roar in Windsor, California on April 13 with a professional field joining amateur riders on the hunt to claim chunks of a $20,000 cash purse. The Growler is one of seven ride options at Levi’s GranFondo, which was founded by former WorldTour pro [Levi Leipheimer](https://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/levi-leipheimer/) in 2009. It is the first time in the four-year history of the longest route, 139 miles of ‘single track for road bikes’ with 13,500 feet of climbing, that pros and amateurs compete together for cash prizes. $20,000 will be split evenly among the top five men and five women. Also new is that winners of The Growler will be determined at the finish line of a full course rather than at the top of the final climb. The trek across wine country of Sonoma County in northern California can be bucolic, but Sonoma-native [Peter Stetina](https://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/peter-stetina/), who was one of the first pros to jump on board, said the rough roads and gruelling terrain lend comparisons already to Liège-Bastogne-Liège. “The local excitement around this is already palpable and I cannot convey how difficult and majestic this route is. It is the hardest one-day course in America, hands down,” Stetina explained to Cyclingnews. Confirmed for the start line with Stetina are other former WorldTour riders now dominating the pro gravel circuit, including [Petr Vakoč](https://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/petr-vakoc/), [Lachlan Morton](https://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/lachlan-morton/) and Ian Boswell, while the women’s field includes multi-discipline stars [Sarah Sturm](https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/sbt-grvl-10-riders-to-watch/), [Heather Jackson](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/russel-finsterwald-and-heather-jackson-win-at-belgian-waffle-ride-california/) and [Peta Mullens](https://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/peta-mullens/). All but Boswell are part of the [2024 Life Time Grand Prix](https://www.cyclingnews.com/life-time-grand-prix/) off-road series. Stetina described the event as a ‘proper road race’, though it is non-traditional in many respects, such as no team cars are permitted on course. In a nod to gravel racing, aid stations will be positioned on the route and a rolling closure enforced. “Here in SoCo, we call our road riding ‘Sonoma County single track’. The roads are sinuous, pitchy, and often beat up. It makes the riding very dynamic, and I always train on 30c tires. Think of it as gravel bike handling for road bikes, very fun!” The calendar and geographical position for The Growler makes the event appealing for the off-road cast of characters competing in North American gravel series, with Belgian Waffle Ride Utah the weekend before on April 6 and Sea Otter Classic’s Fuego XL in Monterrey, California following on April 19. For domestic road racing, the Growler conflicts with Redlands Bicycle Classic, but avoids the first UCI stage race in the US, Tour of the Gila which begins on April 24. On the international calendar, the Gravel Earth Series has a race in Spain on the same weekend as The Growler. “Last year we were on the same weekend as Sea Otter and we definitely felt that. There’s so many events it’s really hard to not overlap, like Redlands. I would love to get some young up and coming road guys and some of them hopefully aren't at Redlands, but we’ve got the big names of gravel, and they are probably the fastest bike riders in America these days,” event founder Leipheimer told Cyclingnews. “This is a huge opportunity to give back to the sport that gave me so much and give young up and coming US road hopefuls the arena to test themselves and the show themselves to experience what it's like to race on a course that challenging.” How challenging is the course? He talked about a concoction of factors which create a one-day race more akin to Tour of Lombardy, “distance, elevation gain, potholes, cracks”, and the list of ingredients went on. “In the remote parts of Sonoma County, where there’s a lot of rain, the roads don’t get repaved a lot,” he laughed. “These roads have character, they are far from pristine. That’s part of what makes this ride so great, it’s very engaging. You’ve got to be focused, and you can’t use the lightest road racing tires or you might not make it.” The climb on King Ridge Road, with an average gradient of 10.7% for over a mile, is the signature of the event, used for the 120-mile Gran ride route and the 139-mile Growler. It is a climb that was featured in the 2016 Amgen Tour of California, a stage race Leipheimer won three times before he retired in 2012, and was also part of the 1988 Coors Classic. It is just 30 miles into the Growler that the King Ridge climb hits, then the route heads north in a clockwise direction for a pair of long, steep climbs on Stewarts Point Road. The Growler indeed growls with another 3,000 feet of elevation gain on the Geysers, a 15-mile stretch to the highest point including pitches of 12-13% and then the return loop back to Windsor, just a few miles north of Santa Rosa. Amateurs are invited to take part in The Growler, and can share in the prize money if they finish among the overall top five in men’s and women’s categories. Unlike past years, there is no qualification process for entry, instead organisers will implement a strict cut-off time at the start of Geysers road. “The GranFondo was born out of my love for road racing in my career. And we've seen this shift in bike racing in the US the last few years, going away from road racing. There is a very big crit scene, which is great, but there’s a no-man’s land,” said Leipheimer, who works with Bike Monkey of California to produce the event. “The United States does not have a road race that does one loop of 136 miles with 13,000 feet of climbing. With Bike Monkey, a local events company in Sonoma County, we've gained a lot of expertise, knowledge, relationships with landowners and local agencies that have allowed us to actually execute a race that is 136 miles. And that's really not easy, especially in the United States. What we want to do is provide the opportunity [for racers] to show their endurance and their strength on a course like this.” Proceeds from all events at Levi’s GranFondo have raised more than $3 million since 2009 for the King Ridge Foundation, which serves at-risk youth organisations.

    "text": "As the cryptocurrency market records notable fluctuations, DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as a dominant contender, positioning itself as a potential multi-million dollar token.\nWith a presale rapidly collecting over $4.7 million, DTX has attracted holders seeking lucrative opportunities beyond the established PEPE and BNB tokens. DTX Exchange’s standout features and massive growth potential have helped it stand out.\nWith its highly promising trajectory, experts say DTX Exchange will redefine the whole crypto space, potentially outshining PEPE and BNB in the long term.\nDTX Exchange: A Rising Star Amid the Crypto Market Uncertainty Amidst the many uncertainties affecting the PEPE and BNB markets, experts have turned to DTX Exchange, which they believe could be the next multi-million dollar token. The advanced DTX Exchange is making ripples in the crypto waters, with its presale selling out rapidly.\nDTX Exchange’s top features include 1000x leverage, algo and quant trading, risk management tools, real-time analytics, and AI-powered automation strategies. These features resolve the issues affecting retail holders previously disadvantaged by market designs and dynamics.\nAll these features have pushed analysts to insist that the platform can grow to compete with established platforms, underpinned by its low-cost trading and scalability.\nDecentralized smart contracts bypass brokers and other third parties that exploit traditional markets and boost the integration of multiple asset classes.\nThe DTX presale has raised over $4.7 million in funding, and analysts say it will reach $5 million by the end of October 2024.\nCurrently, in Stage 4 of its public presale, DTX is trading at $0.08, a 300% increase from its original value of $0.02. After the presale moves to Stage 5, its value will surge to $0.10, a 25% profit for the current buyers.\nOn that note, crypto analyst and YouTuber Crypto Legends believe DTX will gain 55x after being listed on mainstream markets. Hence, the DeFi coin is becoming the next multi-million dollar token.\nPEPE’s Bullish Move: 11% Surge and Potential for Further Gains Pepe’s price soared more than 11% in the past three days. Because of this surge, PEPE has wiped out nearly all losses from the drop experienced on October 1, 2024. The meme coin has been on a bullish momentum for most of 2024, and analysts believe it will rise further with the coming bull cycle.\nNonetheless, a strong resistance level has formed at $0.00001102, which slowed PEPE’s upside momentum. If PEPE manages to break this resistance sustainably, it will have a solid foundation to rise from in the coming weeks.\nOn October 16, PEPE was valued at $0.00001018, up 4.74% in the past week. Analysts say increased buying pressure will support PEPE’s surge to $0.00001165 this month.\nBNB’s Remarkable Growth: A Journey of 1,393,186.33% Increase BNB has made a remarkable journey since its lowest price of $0.03982, recorded on October 19, 2017, nearly seven years ago. In October 2024, its value is a massive 1,393,186.33% above that all-time low.\nSeveral factors have recently contributed to the increase in BNB’s value. For instance, Changpeng Zhao might be the former CEO of Binance, but his recent release from a 4-month jail term resulted in a massive surge in BNB’s demand. When Zhao published his first post after the release, BNB’s price spiked to a monthly high of $616.53.\nAlthough BNB has not returned to these levels since then, analysts say Zhao’s appearance at the Binance Blockchain Week in October could push BNB higher. On October 16, 2024, BNB was valued at $591.09, up 1.36% in the past week.\nAnalysts say BNB will rise to $615.18 in October, supported by increased buying pressure. Despite the bullish momentum, DTX Exchange may outshine BNB’s massive growth momentum.\nDTX Exchange: The Emerging Powerhouse in the Crypto Space DTX Exchange has emerged as a dominant force in crypto, showing massive potential to outshine established coins like PEPE and BNB. With its many advanced features, DTX Exchange is designed to address retail holders’ challenges and improve their trading experience.\nThe rapid success of DTX’s presale, which has raised over $4.7 million, highlights growing confidence and the token’s lucrative prospects. As DTX moves into higher stages of its presale, analysts predict the token could record massive gains after listing on mainstream markets, strengthening its position as a leader in the quest for the next multi-million dollar token.\nThe token’s promising trajectory makes it an exciting opportunity for those aiming to capitalize on the future of digifi.\nLearn more:\nPresale\nVisit DTX Website\nJoin The DTX Community",

    "text": "Gov. Greg Abbott speaks after signing bills designated towards enhancing border security, Austin, TX, June 08, 2023. Brandon Bell/Getty Images The White House on Thursday pushed back hard on Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's latest showdown with President Joe Biden over who controls the southern border.\nIn a statement posted on X on Wednesday, Abbott claimed the situation with immigrants crossing into Texas was an \"invasion,\" and that because Biden had not enforced the law, his state had a constitutional right to \"self-defense.\"\nHe said he would ignore any federal government effort to remove razor wire Texas had installed along the border with Mexico.\n\"The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states,\" Abbott alleged in the statement. \"The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting States, including immigration laws on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them. The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration.\"\nGov. Greg Abbott speaks after signing bills designated towards enhancing border security, Austin, TX, June 08, 2023. Brandon Bell/Getty Images MORE: Supreme Court allows federal agents to remove razor wire Texas placed at border\nHe argued that the state's right of self-defense superseded any federal law, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the Border Patrol could remove the razor wire. (Abbot's claim that a state has a right to \"self-defense\" has never been tested in court.)\n\"That authority is the Supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statues to the contrary,\" he alleged. \"The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border.\nAbbott had ordered the Texas National Guard and Department of Public Safety to put up the razor wire, specifically in Shelby Park, which is near the Eagle Pass section of the border, the site of heavy migrants crossing and a hotspot in the back and forth between the White House and the governor.\nPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks during a campaign event in Manassas, VA, Jan. 23, 2024. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters MORE: Immigration emerges as key 2024 election wedge issue for Trump, vulnerability for Biden\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4 on Monday, cleared the way for federal agents to remove the wire, which administration officials and immigration advocates had called dangerous and inhumane.\n“On Tuesday, DHS sent Texas a letter outlining the access Border Patrol needs in Shelby Park to do their jobs, and demanding Texas confirm this access will be honored,\" a White House spokesperson told ABC News. \"As we have said many times before, Governor Abbott should stop his extreme political stunts and stop making it harder and more dangerous for Border Patrol to do their jobs.”\nThe Department of Homeland Security argues the state's activities interfered with clear federal supremacy in setting border enforcement policy.\nThe letter to Texas, obtained by ABC News, demands Texas \"remove\" any obstructions to Shelby Park in Eagle Pass.\nTexas law enforcement, on Abbott's order, has blocked Customs and Border Protection's physical access to Shelby Park.\nThe Supreme Court on Monday vacated a lower court injunction prohibiting DHS from cutting the wire, \"and restored the Department’s right to cut and move the concertina wire placed by Texas in order to perform their statutory duties,\" DHS General Counsel Jonathan Meyer wrote to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nConcertina wire, placed by the Texas National Guard, is set up around the perimeter of a pit previously used to hold migrants in Shelby Park, at the U.S.-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, TX Jan. 16, 2024. Kaylee Greenlee Beal/Reuters MORE: DHS threatens to take 'appropriate action' against Texas over border access\nDHS believes that Shelby Park is not open to the public, as Texas has claimed it is. Meyer says the department has acquired permanent real estate interests in and around Eagle Pass in 2008 to support the construction and maintenance of border barriers in and around the Shelby Park area.\n\"We demand that you immediately remove any and all obstructions on it, which include the access points into Shelby Park near the intersections of Ryan and Main Streets and Ryan and Rio Grande Streets, as well as the access points on Ford Street and the two access points on the end of Ryan Street,\" Meyer writes.\nMeyer outlined the areas for which DHS requested access that it says are being blocked by Texas saying they need access to them and need Texas to confirm they'll grant access to the Park by Jan. 26.\nAbbott kept up the fight Thursday.\n\"The president of the United States is not fulfilling his duty to enforce the laws passed by Congress that deny illegal entry into the United States,\" Abbott said on Fox News.\nBut he did not answer if he would physically prevent federal officers from accessing Shelby Park.\nOn Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson backed his fellow Republican in his escalating battle with the White House.\n\"I stand with Governor Abbott. The House will do everything in its power to back him up,\" Johnson posted on X.\nThe Supreme Court justices did not elaborate on their order but it was seen as meaning federal border agents could resume full control of the contested border area while litigation continues.\nDespite that, Texas DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez posted video of Texas National Guard reinforcing some of the barriers along the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass on Thursday.\nTexas DPS and the Texas Military Department \"will continue to hold the line,\" he said.\nDemocratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, who represents San Antonio, said in a post on X that Abbott is \"using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border.\"\n\"If Abbott is defying yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, @POTUS needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas National Guard now,\" he said.\nJohn Cohen, who served as the former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, said Abbott's interpretation is not accurate.\n\"An invasion referring to a mass migratory movement as an invasion is consistent with white supremacist ideological beliefs,\" Cohen, an ABC News contributor, said.\n\"We are we certainly are in a period of humanitarian crisis, and we certainly are dealing with a dramatic increase in people who are fleeing poverty, violence, public health issues, and seeking the protection and the safety of the United States under international agreements and federal law,\" he said.\nRelated Topics Biden Administration Immigration",
