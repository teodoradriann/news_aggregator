    "text": "Sunday, January 14th 2024, 2:18 pm As temperatures plummet to single and even negative digits, many vulnerable people are left wondering where to go to stay warm. “It’s -1 right now outside, and -16 with the wind...the cold cuts right through you,” said Keith McPhail, co-founder of B the Light Mission in Bartlesville. The brutally cold weather could mean life or death for some. “We’re just not gonna let that happen; whatever we can do, we’re going to provide this warm space,” said Keith's wife and co-founder, Christy McPhail. The B the Light Mission serves as a refuge from the dangerously cold temperatures. “We’re able to hold 38 people in here. Currently, we have 21 people and 4 dogs,” said Keith. The McPhail’s began the non-profit four years ago, but say they officially took off last year when a hospital donated them a building. “We can provide them shelter here and provide some love and some care,” Keith said. They both say helping the homeless is a calling. “We’ve both had loss in our life. I was a former drug addict myself, and we lost our oldest son 14 years ago…accidentally shot, and so we kind of understand what it's like to feel hopeless,” they said. Keith says at one point, he didn’t have a place to go. “There was no place like this when I was living in my car,” he said. There is only one other shelter in Bartlesville, and the McPhail's say it wasn't enough. “We feel like there’s room for two; they need help, and we’re gonna work together to help work on this problem that’s become so relevant,” said Christy. That’s why they jump into action and provide what others need. “3 meals a day, snacks all day, coffee, hot chocolate.... love,\" Keith said. And, of course, a lifeline during this cold snap. Their goal is to use every inch of the 58,000-square-foot building as a full-time homeless shelter. They were originally planning on closing on Thursday, but the mission will stay open until Friday because the temperatures will remain low.

    "text": "Mumbai, Dec 28 T he Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in Mumbai has notched a series of achievements, innovative technological upgrades and world-class services to solidify its position as an aviation industry leader, an official said here on Thursday. he Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in Mumbai has notched a series of achievements, innovative technological upgrades and world-class services to solidify its position as an aviation industry leader, an official said here on Thursday. This year, the airport completed a major re-carpeting for Runway 14/32 to enhance overall efficiency, introduced Taxiway Z to reduce entry-exit times for aircraft and reduce carbon emissions, as first in the Asian region to offer a flexible-use apron. The CSMIA also became the first airport in Asia to commission a specialised Disabled Aircraft Recovery Kit (DARK), with high-pressure lifting bags. DARK ensures a superior and efficient recovery process for even the largest commercial aircraft, reinforcing CSMIA's commitment to safety and security. On November 25, the CSMIA notched the highest passenger traffic movement in a single day with 167,132 passengers travelling through CSMIA (over 120,000 domestic passengers and more than 46,000 international travellers). On November 11, the airport achieved a highest single-day record of 1,032 air traffic movements, or flights, surpassing its own previous record of 2018. Strengthening its connectivity, CSMIA announced its summer schedule with 14 per cent more weekly flight movements as compared to the summer schedule of 2022. Similarly, the Winter Schedule for 2023-2024 witnessed more than 950 daily flight movements, representing an 8-per cent increase compared to the previous year. With an extensive network connecting travellers to 115 different destinations, CSMIA continues to enhance connectivity for passengers. These were fuelled by an increased demand for domestic and international travel movement from CSMIA, which in turn benefits the travellers from Mumbai and neighbouring cities. The CSMIA also held a grand 70-day-long Summer Carnival in April 2023, offering captivating experiences and irresistible discounts across 100+ retail and FnB outlets. Aiming to become one of the world's best airports, the CSMIA has been working towards elevating its facilities and services to create a seamless passenger journey at the airport. The airport's Terminal 2 has been a major gateway offering exceptional infrastructure facilities aiding in the introduction of pioneering services and advanced technology. For this, the CSMIA installed 2D Barcode readers at the entry gates of Terminals 1&2, streamlining entry procedures and ensuring a hassle-free travel experience. The airport also introduced an Advanced Parking Guidance System at Terminal 2, a system that combines state-of-the-art technology with thoughtful design, ensuring travellers experience seamless and stress-free parking, to enhance passenger convenience. Aspiring to become net-zero by 2029, the CSMIA led in sustainability initiatives -- its commitment to becoming one of the first to eliminate Single-Use Plastic earned it the title of the 'Best Sustainable Airport of the Year' by ASSOCHAM. It also introduced Uber Green, the flagship electric vehicle service by Uber, for eco-friendly passenger mobility options. The prestigious Platinum Rating in Green Airports Recognition (GAR) Programme 2023 by the Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific highlighted the CSMIA's commitment to sustainability. The CSMIA is the first in India, the second in the Asia-Pacific region and the third globally, to receive this coveted recognition. During the year, the CSMIA's commitment to excellence bagged awards such as the 'Best Airport over 40 million passengers' for the year 2022 in the Asia Pacific region by ACI's Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards. Looking ahead to 2024, the CSMIA is poised for continued success in the coming year and beyond, setting new benchmarks and delivering excellence in air travel, said the officials.

    "title": "Losing the NBA rights is a 'major blow' for WBD: Analyst",
    "text": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) has officially rejected Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) bid to keep streaming NBA games on its TNT platform. Tim Nollen, Macquarie U.S. equity research senior media tech analyst joins Market Domination to shares his thoughts on this development. Nollen says it's clear that the NBA was \"a valuable property for TNT,\" benefiting both its cable TV ad business and \"their ability to secure carriage fees.\" He notes that the biggest loss is the opportunity to stream games on Max, as \"streaming is the present and future of TV.\" While WBD has a strong content lineup, Nollen points out that \"without the NBA, that is their biggest piece... of sports content that which will now be going away.\" Nollen claims that though the rights are expensive, he views the NBA as \"an essential property\" for WBD to keep. \"I think the importance of the NBA probably cannot be understated, and therefore it's a major blow, I'd say, to not have the NBA going forward,\" Nollen told Yahoo Finance, adding that this might affect WBD's subscriber numbers.

    "text": "First Alert Forecast: Gorgeous weekend on the way Lots of sunshine, warm afternoons ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A beautiful, Fall-like weekend is in store across North Georgia! After quite the cool morning in the 40s to mid 50s, temperatures will warm nicely this afternoon under sunny skies. Highs today will climb into the mid to upper 70s. Tomorrow will be a touch warmer, but we will continue to see lots of sun! After a chilly morning in the upper 40s to mid 50s, highs will climb into the low 80s Sunday afternoon. The upcoming week brings quite the cool down. In fact, a First Alert Weather Day is on the way Tuesday for the coldest temperatures since Mid May. Monday, highs will be in the mid 70s, but as a front moves in Monday night, temperatures quickly drop. Tuesday morning will be in the low 40s to near 50 across the area, but highs will only reach the mid to upper 60s. It will also be breezy, so be sure to have a slightly heavier jacket Tuesday. Highs will say in the 60s with morning lows anywhere from the upper 30s to low 40s Wednesday through Friday. No rain expected this week. Copyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Vida microscópica en todos sus estados. Nikon anunció el jueves 17 de octubre los ganadores de su concurso de fotografía, el Concurso de fotomicrografía Nikon Small World. El primer premio recayó en los especialistas Bruno Cisterna y Eric Vitriol, de la Universidad de Augusta, Georgia (Estados Unidos), por su trabajo con células cerebrales de ratón. Su fotografía muestra cómo las alteraciones del citoesqueleto de la célula pueden provocar enfermedades como el Alzheimer. El resto después de este anuncio. “Uno de los principales problemas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es que no entendemos del todo qué las causa”, afirmó el doctor Cisterna, antes de continuar: “Para desarrollar tratamientos eficaces, primero debemos entender los conceptos básicos. Nuestra investigación es crucial para descubrir este conocimiento y, en última instancia, encontrar una cura”. Desde hace 50 años, el concurso pone de relieve el trabajo de los investigadores médicos. Esto permite a los fotomicrografistas, de una amplia gama de disciplinas científicas, comunicar sus investigaciones de otras formas además de las revistas científicas. “A sus 50 años, Nikon Small World es más que un simple concurso de imágenes: se ha convertido en una galería que celebra a las personas extraordinarias que lo hacen posible. Son la fuerza impulsora detrás de este evento, combinando magistralmente ciencia y arte para revelar las maravillas del mundo microscópico”, afirmó Eric Flem de Nikon. France",
