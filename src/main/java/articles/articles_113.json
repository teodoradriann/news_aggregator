    "text": "Share via:\nFacebook\nTwitter LinkedIn\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy Link\nPastor Vlad Savchuk is sounding the alarm: the spirit of Jezebel is at work in today’s culture, and the church must rise up in boldness to confront it.\nA Shift in Culture and the Church’s Response Savchuk explains that especially over the past decade, society’s perception of Christianity has drastically changed. He warns that what was once considered demonic has now been normalized—paganism, gender confusion and even open hostility toward biblical values. While the seeker-friendly model of church worked for a while, it cannot work now with a society raging against the truth of biblical values.\n“We live in a generation today that is different than it was in the year 2000,” Savchuk says. “And if you use the same methods, you’re not going to be effective.”\nThis means that Christians today have no choice but to take a strong, biblical stance on issues. To truly be walking in the anointing and the power of God, this is necessary.\nBreaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nAnointing to Confront Jezebel Using the biblical account of Jehu in 2 Kings 9, Savchuk highlights how God raises up leaders to confront the spirit of Jezebel.\n“I do believe in the midst of this craziness, in the midst of this wickedness, God is raising up a wild anointing,” Savchuk says. “It’s becoming more common, it’s becoming more acceptable and it’s actually going to become more trendy. Because for every Goliath God has a David. And for every Jezebel He has a Jehu.”\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nHope for Revival Despite the increasing darkness, Savchuk has hope for the future. He prophesies a coming revival where church altars will be filled with repentant hearts.\n“I believe a season is coming where the altars of the church are going to be filled with the lost people,” Savchuk says. “Any church that does not save the lost is lost…there is a shift in the realm of the Spirit.”\nTHANK YOU FOR VISITING MYCHARISMA.COM.

A Revolutionary Partnership in Sustainability AQGroup, noted for its leadership in green electricity production and computing infrastructure development, has entered into a strategic partnership with MVGX Group.

Capitalizing on Kazakhstan’s Energy Potential Kazakhstan is positioned as a key player in the green energy landscape, boasting the world's ninth-largest land area along with abundant renewable energy resources. The country’s unique geographical position allows it to harness significant wind and solar energy potential, making it an attractive hub for investments in green energy generation.

Whether you are a content creator, educator, marketer, or just someone who enjoys making videos, the ability to add high-quality voiceovers can significantly enhance your content.

CapCut’s built-in text-to- speech feature offers a budget-friendly alternative without compromising on quality.\n3. Consistency and Clarity TTS ensures uniformity in tone, pronunciation, and volume across your video. This is especially useful for educational content, corporate presentations, and tutorial videos.\n4.

Ensure the text is clear, well-structured, and punctuated to achieve a natural-sounding voiceover.\nStep 4: Convert Text to Speech Select the text box and click on the “Text-to-Speech” option.

    "text": "Context is powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Newsroom. Our Standards: [Thomson Reuters Trust Principles](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html) A social housing block where the government is funding the installation of a solar energy system to help residents manage high electricity bills in Adelaide, Australia. January 23 2024. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Rina Chandran About one-third of Australian homes have solar panels, but the benefits have eluded renters and those in social housing ADELAIDE – As a university student in Canberra, Eilis Fitt and her two housemates set rules to keep their electricity bill down - no heater in the living room unless everyone was home, and no turning on the washing machine or dishwasher during peak hours. So she was delighted - and surprised - when their landlord installed solar panels about a year after she moved in. After some initial hiccups, the effect was startling: their electricity bills \"went down significantly,\" she said. \"It made us feel so much more comfortable about turning on the heater when it got cold,\" said Fitt, 25. \"We got lucky - it's very rare for renters to have solar. Landlords generally don't care about how much tenants have to fork out for their electricity use,\" she told Context. Australia has the highest solar capacity installed per capita in the world, with photovoltaic panels in about one-third of households, or 3.6 million homes. That helps many cope with some of the [highest electricity prices](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/electricity_prices/) in the Asia Pacific. But the benefits have largely eluded renters and those living in social housing, with analysts estimating that only 4% of rental homes have solar power. \"There are no incentives for renters to pay for solar systems themselves, since they have limited security of tenure, let alone rights to do much to the property itself,\" said Dylan McConnell, a renewable energy researcher at the University of New South Wales. \"Similarly, landlords have limited incentive to install solar, since only the renter has the relationship with the energy retailer and can therefore benefit,\" said McConnell. But there is a growing realisation that installing solar on social housing and rentals - which make up more than 30% of properties - is essential to meeting clean energy targets, McConnell said. So there are efforts to encourage landlords to make that investment, he said, with incentives such as [grants, rebates and low-interest loans](https://www.solar.vic.gov.au/solar-rebates-rental-properties %20 ). Australia, with a population of some 25 million, is seeing more frequent extreme weather events such as forest fires, floods, and especially heat waves which are forecast to increase in frequency, intensity and duration due to climate change. Generous subsidies, alongside \"dramatically escalating\" electricity prices, kickstarted the household PV boom from around 2010, according to McConnell, helping more than double Australia's renewable electricity generation in the last decade. However, renters and those living in social housing are experiencing \"energy hardship\", the energy regulator said in a [November report](https://www.aer.gov.au/system/files/2023-11/Game%20Changer%20Report%20-%20November%202023.pdf) that recommended rebates and other assistance. A more desirable solution is solar, but it can be hard for renters and those living in low socio-economic areas to get finance, said Jenny Paradiso, co-founder and managing director of solar firm Suntrix. \"The people who want solar have already got it by now. So we have to go after the renters, the low-income households, those who live far from the grid, and make it easier for them,\" she said in her office as Adelaide experienced its warmest day of the summer, with a high of more than 41 degrees Celsius (105.8F). Suntrix was among the first solar firms to install SolShare, a technology that allows apartments to share solar energy from a single rooftop system that is connected to the units via the building's main switchboard, and delivers energy equitably. \"Tech plays a big part - it's not just about the panels,\" said Paradiso. \"Technologies like SolShare make solar [more accessible](https://www.context.news/just-transition/indian-tech-could-boost-home-solar-panel-use-heres-how) to everyone.\" The SolShare, developed by Australian startup Allume, has been embraced by apartment blocks and affordable housing providers such as Housing Choices Australia, a non-profit that owns and manages about 7,400 properties across the country. Housing Choices has installed solar panels in more than a dozen properties each in South Australia and Western Australia, and in some 500 properties in Victoria, including three apartment blocks with SolShare, said spokesperson Emma Duncan. \"Whilst a majority of the solar installations are initiated by Housing Choices, there has been a demand from residents for solar, especially in the past two years, with the rising cost of electricity bills,\" she said. Australia plans to increase the share of clean energy to as much as [82% of overall electricity supply](https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/renewables#:~:text=In%202022%2C%2032%25%20of%20Australia's,earlier%202021%2D22%20financial%20year.) by 2030 from about a third. Solar currently accounts for the biggest share of clean energy production, at nearly 14%. Solar is the \"most cost-effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to household electricity use\" because producing electricity at the point of consumption reduces transmission and distribution energy losses, according to the energy regulator. But with fewer subsidies and the declining value of energy exported back into the grid during daylight hours, there is less incentive for landlords to install solar, said McConnell. A survey last year by advocacy group Better Renting showed that about [one-in-three](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/betterrenting/pages/393/attachments/original/1697688496/Solar_Flair_report.pdf?1697688496) renters were keen to get solar because of non-financial reasons, such as contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future. Yet most renters surveyed also worried that landlords would use solar to justify rent increases. At a social housing complex in Adelaide, where Suntrix is installing solar panels and SolShare as part of a government-funded renovation, residents in the 96 units are mostly concerned about lowering their electricity bills, said Paradiso. \"There is greater awareness of the benefits of solar - though it's mostly the economic benefits they're looking at,\" she said. \"But more and more, they are also worried about their carbon footprint.\" (Reporting by Rina Chandran; Editing by Jon Hemming) Context is powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Newsroom.

Doch eine Katastrophe ist ausgeblieben.\nAufatmen in Kalifornien: Nach dem Einsturz eines Tunnels im Großraum der US-Metropole Los Angeles hat die Feuerwehr alle Eingeschlossenen bergen können. 31 Menschen, wohl alle Tunnelarbeiter, seien am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) lebend und ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet worden, teilte die Feuerwehr mit. Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250710-930-780610/1",
