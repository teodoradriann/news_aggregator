    "title": "Plan New Year’s Eve 2024 Celebrations With Your Horoscope",
    "text": "star material Breaking down all the tools you need to use the universe to unpack your desires, fears, motivations, and more.\nThe year is almost over — but leave it to the cosmos to close it out with a bang! On December 29, Venus (the planet of love, beauty, and values) skips into playful and passionate Sagittarius, and the following day, lucky Jupiter finally wraps up its retrograde motion in earthy Taurus. Yes, things will be coming up roses … but don’t forget Mercury is still retrograde until January 1, all but guaranteeing missed text messages, traffic jams, and lots of headaches sprinkled throughout your New Year’s Eve .\nSo how can you work with the energy and optimize the last night of 2023? Read on to discover your New Year’s Eve horoscope!\nAries We know you love to win, Aries. But what does that mean on New Year’s Eve? Getting invited to the coolest party? Wearing the most bedazzled ensemble? Securing the most iconic midnight kiss? If your answer is “all of the above,” well, of course it is. But before you invest all your time and energy planning the ”perfect” evening, maybe you should allocate a little bit of room for … spontaneity? Let’s be honest, Aries, with Mercury still retrograde and the moon activating the area of your chart associated with routine, it’s possible that not everything will go according to plan. You don’t need to have a full-blown meltdown for every minor pivot; just try to keep your cool.\nTaurus Love is in the air … and you’re definitely feeling it! This New Year’s Eve, you’ll be basking in romance, creativity, and play: A ton of planetary energy is lighting up areas of your chart associated with both passion and possibilities, so don’t be surprised if you feel extra amorous under this enchanted sky. But of course, there’s a catch: In order to experience these cosmic blessings, you’ll need to embrace the unknown and release your signature rigidity. I know it may sound cheesy, but when you open your mind to new perspectives, your heart will be sure to follow.\nGemini There are so! Many! Things! You want to do on New Year’s Eve — how could you possibly commit to just one plan? Or one party? Or one friend group? I’m sorry to say it, Gemini, but between Mercury moving backward in the area of your chart associated with social connections and the moon in Virgo making you feeling a bit anxious, it may be best to stay close to home. Listen, I’m not saying you can’t have fun, but maybe coordinating a last-minute helicopter ride for a friend-of-a-friend’s party that might not even be happening isn’t the wisest move. Just saying.\nCancer Everyone knows New Year’s Eve can be a very stressful holiday. There’s pressure for it to be fantastic and memorable — as if what we do on this one night sets a precedent for the next 12 months. This New Year’s Eve, I encourage you to do what actually lights you up. Spend time with people who make you feel joyful and inspired. Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident, regardless of whether it’s new and sparkly. Or ditch the plans altogether and spend the evening at home relaxing, charging up for an entire year ahead. TL;DR: This year, do New Year’s Eve your way. There’s no reason to force anything at all.\nLeo You’re an excellent listener, especially when you can relate to someone else’s story. And when you relate, you’re excited to share your personal experiences, which reminds you of the time when … wait. What were we talking about again? If this scenario is all too familiar, I encourage you to slow down this New Year’s Eve. Everyone loves Main-Character Energy, but — under this electric sky — you’ll want to make sure you don’t leave people with the wrong impression: You are not that self-centered Leo stereotype! Instead, focus on ways you can pass the mic to others and give them center stage. Don’t worry, you’ll always be shining in your own special way!\nVirgo On the last night of 2023, the moon will be careering through your zodiac sign, which means you’ll be feeling extra connected to emotions — and not just your own! Don’t be surprised if you end up absorbing others’ thoughts, feelings, and vibes throughout the evening. And while it’s definitely cool to be so tuned in, keep in mind that those heightened sensitivities may not be the most pleasurable experience. You may find yourself wanting to cheer people up, fix external problems, or come up with helpful solutions to situations that are totally out of your control. Remember, Virgo, others’ experiences are not your responsibility. Just focus on yourself, and the rest will come together! Promise!\nLibra You’re the diplomat of the zodiac, which means you’re happy to calibrate your needs to accommodate your surroundings. When it comes to a high-stakes night like New Year’s Eve, you want to ensure everyone has a fabulous time — but what about you?! What do you want? What are you excited about? On this special evening (and in the year ahead, really), be sure to stand up for yourself and advocate for your desires. Libra, it’s time to let others bend to your wishes for a change. Hey, it’s only fair!\nScorpio There’s nothing you love more than a good scandal. It’s part of what makes you so … Scorpionic. But on New Year’s Eve, you may want to consider trying to keep the peace instead of sparking conflict. WIth Mercury still retrograde and the moon activating the area of your chart associated with friendship and community, this is an opportunity for you to slow down, collect information, and try to bring people together. Believe it or not, you can still be edgy and mysterious without shrouding yourself in drama. You really can have it all!\nSagittarius Mercury is retrograde in your sign, and just a few days ago, Venus decided to join the fun. So what does that mean for you? This New Year’s Eve, expect a quirky yet lovable mix of chaos and joy! Yes, things may go wrong: Traffic jams may slow you down, parties may get canceled, or high heels may snap. But that’s the spice of life, isn’t it? There’s no one more equipped to roll with the punches than you, Sagittarius. After all, who knows … perhaps all of that rom-com-worthy disarray might land you in the arms of some mysterious New Year’s Eve lover. What a perfect way to kick off 2024!\nCapricorn You’re a big-picture person. You’re more concerned about your 2024 goals and aspirations than about your New Year’s Eve plans. Which, totally fair! But this is also your birthday season , Capricorn, which means it’s okay to have fun and celebrate, too. Maybe set some intentions before your night begins? Or invite your friends to share their resolutions before the ball drops? Whether you’re celebrating your birthday, the year ahead, or the fact that 2023 is finally over, don’t be afraid to customize this night to make it fun and magical for you!\nAquarius Are you feeling … a little psychic? ’Tis the season to be witchy, and with the Sun moving through the area of your chart associated with paranormal and otherworldly experiences, you’ll be deeply connected to other dimensions. This may manifest in a number of ways: Perhaps you’ll have a ghostly encounter on New Year’s Eve (how wild!), or maybe you’ll feel just a bit more emotional and energetically exhausted. If that’s the case, don’t push yourself. There’s nothing wrong with having a quiet evening at home to rest and restore before the year ahead. Maybe the spirits are trying to tell you to take it easy!\nPisces Are you ready for your close-up? Because exciting news, Pisces: On New Year’s Eve, powerful planets will be illuminating the area of your chart associated with fame, fortune, and legacy … which means all eyes will be on you! So even if strategic networking wasn’t part of your 2024 plan, you may want to consider how your hopes, dreams, and aspirations can be realized under this enchanted sky.

Denunció ante los representantes de los 187 Estados miembros de la organización los «ataques que los trabajadores y jubilados argentinos están sufriendo por parte del gobierno de Javier Milei».\n«La eficiencia del orden democrático de un país puede medirse por la eficacia de la libertad sindical, y podemos afirmar categóricamente que sin libertad sindical no hay democracia. En la Argentina, es la democracia misma la que está en riesgo en este momento», apuntó el dirigente desde el Palacio de las Naciones Unidas.\nAgregó que «el proceso de criminalización de la protesta en el país es gravísimo. No podemos naturalizar que se estén allanando domicilios de dirigentes y de sedes sindicales».\nFrente a miles de delegados de trabajadores, empleadores y gobiernos de todo el mundo, el dirigente estatal expuso que «llegamos a esta Conferencia Internacional del Trabajo para denunciar al Gobierno y al presidente Milei. Desde el mismo 10 de diciembre los estatales estamos siendo atacados, agraviados, insultados. Nos quitan derechos, destruyen nuestros puestos de empleo y demuelen nuestros salarios».\nAguiar informó sobre los despidos masivos y dijo que «las medidas económicas del Gobierno hasta aquí han sido lapidarias. En tan solo cinco meses aumentó drásticamente la pobreza y duplicó la indigencia. En este momento asistimos a un fenómeno de empobrecimiento de los pobres en el país».\nEl dirigente gremial sostuvo que «no podemos aceptar que la respuesta a esta crisis profunda que generaron sea la Ley Bases, una ley que incorpora una reforma laboral absolutamente regresiva. En el 2015, la OIT ya estudió 63 países que impulsaron en el mundo legislaciones similares y todas fracasaron. Para terminar con la emergencia de empleo y salario que existe hoy, hay que hacer todo lo contrario a lo que está haciendo este Gobierno».\nAnte la atenta mirada de trabajadores de todos los continentes, alertados por la grave situación que vive el país, Aguiar concluyó que «enfrentamos un programa económico orientado a entregar a las potencias extranjeras todas las riquezas que producimos exclusivamente los trabajadores, y es con la unidad del movimiento obrero y un pueblo que se niega a firmar su propio certificado de defunción que lo vamos a derrotar».",

    "text": "La Paz registra en lo que va del año 520 casos de picaduras de serpientes, y 234 de arácnidos y escorpiones.\nPor Deisy Ortiz Duran\nFuente: El Deber\nLa temporada de lluvias favorece la proliferación de mosquitos y la aparición de insectos peligrosos, como los alacranes , por lo que las autoridades piden tomar algunas medidas para evitar picaduras.\nEl Servicio Departamental de Salud (Sedes) de la Paz alertó sobre incidentes registrados por la picadura de alacranes no solo en áreas rurales, sino también en el municipio paceño, como el caso reportado el martes de esta semana en la zona de San Antonio, cuando un funcionario fue picado por uno de estos insectos.\nJavier Mamani, jefe de Epidemiología del Sedes La Paz, recomendó tener especial precaución al limpiar los patios, particularmente entre los meses de septiembre y febrero, ya que la humedad favorece la proliferación de animales ponzoñosos, como los escorpiones.\nSegún datos oficiales, en el departamento de La Paz se han registrado hasta la fecha 520 casos de picaduras de serpientes, y 234 de arácnidos y escorpiones, así como otros animales ponzoñosos. “Estos animales pueden encontrarse en patios o jardines”, advirtió Erasmo Cordero, responsable departamental de Zoonosis.\n¿Qué cuidados se deben tomar para evitar picaduras?\n1. Mantener la casa limpia y ordenada: Los alacranes suelen buscar refugio en lugares oscuros y desordenados. Es importante limpiar la casa, especialmente los rincones, debajo de los muebles y en lugares de difícil acceso. A la hora de hacer el aseo en esos ambientes, es necesario usar guantes protectores y estar atentos a cualquier movimientos.\n2. Revisar y sellar grietas y hendiduras: Inspecciona las grietas y hendiduras en paredes, pisos y techos, ya que estos pueden servir como entrada para los alacranes. Sella cualquier espacio con material adecuado para bloquear su acceso.\n3. Colocar barreras físicas: Instalar mallas metálicas en ventanas y puertas puede ser una buena opción para evitar que los alacranes entren en tu hogar. Asegúrate de que las mallas estén bien ajustadas y en buen estado.\n4. Evitar el agua estancada: Los alacranes se sienten atraídos por la humedad. Evita la acumulación de agua en recipientes, charcos o fugas de agua en tuberías. Asegúrate de que los desagües estén en buen estado y funcionando correctamente.\n5. Utilizar insecticidas y repelentes naturales: Aplica insecticidas específicos para alacranes en las áreas vulnerables de tu casa. Además, puedes usar repelentes como el vinagre y la lavandina, los cuales ayudan a mantener alejados.\n6. Revisar calzado y ropa: Antes de ponerte los zapatos, revisa cuidadosamente su interior, ya que los alacranes suelen refugiarse allí. También asegúrate de revisar la ropa tendida al aire libre.",

    "title": "Thailand's Schengen-Style Visa Proposal Faces Hurdles",
    "text": "Picture courtesy: Facebook /Phi Phi World\nThailand's Prime Minister, Srettha Thavisin, has proposed a unified visa system, similar to Europe's Schengen Area, to boost tourism in Southeast Asia. Despite the economic benefits of increased tourist numbers, concerns about feasibility, overtourism and potential inflationary pressure persist. The success of the visa proposal will hinge on the adoption of sustainable tourism practices and effective regional cooperation.\nThai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has recently proposed a novel approach to reinvigorate tourism in Southeast Asia — a Schengen-style visa scheme. Modelled after Europe’s Schengen Area, this unified visa system would allow travel to Thailand , Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos.\nThis initiative is a key component of Thailand’s efforts to boost tourism, aiming to attract 80 million tourists annually by 2027.\nThe Schengen-style visa proposal has potential to significantly enhance Thailand’s economy. Tourism is a vital sector for Thailand, contributing approximately 12 per cent to the country’s GDP annual and providing around 20 per cent of its jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted this sector and its recovery has been slow, which has left Thailand unable to buffer a concurrent decline in manufacturing and exports.\nIn this proposed visa scheme, tourists must first pass through Thailand as a central hub, enhancing Thailand’s appeal as a travel destination. It promises to attract more tourists, especially high-spending visitors who stay for extended periods.\nIncreased tourist arrivals are expected to boost tourist spending, benefiting sectors such as hospitality, retail and transportation. A surge in tourism could also create further job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in regions heavily reliant on tourism.\nThailand’s well-developed tourism infrastructure positions it to benefit greatly from the consequential influx of tourists. Its burgeoning wellness industry, including traditional Thai massages, spa treatments and holistic healing practices, are particularly appealing to tourists seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.\nThe visa initiative could enhance accessibility for tourists interested in wellness experiences and help Thailand capitalise on the thriving global wellness tourism industry.\nThis Schengen-style proposal could also diversify Thailand’s tourism markets. Thailand is traditionally dependent on tourists from the Southeast and East Asia regions, such as Malaysia, China, Russia, South Korea, India and Singapore.\nBut Thailand now seeks to attract tourists from markets farther afield like Europe, the Americas and Africa. This strategy could enhance the Thai tourism sector’s resilience against global economic fluctuations.\nDespite the initiative’s potential economic benefits, there are widespread concerns about its feasibility, the risks associated with overtourism and inflation.\nSoutheast Asia’s political landscape is remarkably diverse and intricate. Achieving consensus among the member states of ASEAN on visa policies is no small feat. Each country maintains its own immigration laws, security concerns and economic interests. Harmonising these disparate elements into a cohesive visa policy requires extensive negotiation and compromise.\nEfforts to create a unified visa system in Southeast Asia are not new. In the 2000s, a joint visa proposal under Ayeyawady–Chao Phraya–Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy — an organisation of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar — only saw Cambodia coordinating with Thailand, reported East Asia Forum .\nIn 2019, an ‘ASEAN Visa’ plan also failed to materialise. Other attempts at regional integration, such as the ASEAN Economic Community, have shown that while progress is possible, it is often slow and fraught with challenges.\nInfrastructure and technological readiness vary significantly across Southeast Asian countries. Implementing a unified visa system necessitates significant investments in border control infrastructure, data sharing mechanisms and security protocols. Countries with less-developed infrastructure may struggle to meet these requirements, potentially delaying the implementation of the scheme.\nAdditionally, this initiative raises broader questions about regional integration and mobility. One important consideration is whether this visa scheme could pave the way for ASEAN citizens to freely work, study or reside across national boundaries, including in Thailand. This potential development carries significant implications for logistics, infrastructure and immigration policies within the Southeast Asian region.\nWhile this Schengen-style visa scheme will undoubtedly enhance travel convenience for international tourists, it stirs apprehension regarding overtourism. Thailand has already experienced the negative impacts of overtourism in popular destinations such as Pattaya, Bangkok, Phuket and Chiang Mai.\nImplementing such a visa scheme without addressing existing overtourism challenges might exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to environmental degradation, strained infrastructure and diminished quality of life for permanent residents.\nOvertourism may also dilute the tourist experience, making popular sites overcrowded, more expensive and less enjoyable. This could ultimately harm Thailand’s reputation as a travel destination and reduce the long-term sustainability of its tourism sector.\nAnother potentially detrimental consequence is the inflationary pressure emanating from a unsustainable influx of wealthy visitors. This would drive up demand for food, daily necessities and housing, which in turn raises prices and increases living costs for residents.\nTo mitigate these risks, Thailand needs to adopt sustainable tourism practices. This includes implementing measures to manage tourist flows, promoting lesser-known destinations and investing in infrastructure that can accommodate increased tourist numbers without compromising the environment or local communities. Regional cooperation is also crucial to ensure the benefits and burdens of increased tourism are equitably distributed among participating countries.\nSrettha’s proposal for a Schengen-style visa scheme in Southeast Asia is an ambitious and innovative idea with the potential to boost tourism and economic growth in the region. But its successful implementation requires overcoming substantial political, logistical and infrastructural challenges. While Thailand stands to gain economically, there is also a significant risk of exacerbating the overtourism crisis.\nTo maximise the potential benefits and minimise the risks, a balanced approach is necessary. Addressing these challenges could make this Schengen-style visa scheme a transformative initiative for Southeast Asian tourism, benefiting both Thailand and the broader region.\n-- 2024-08-09\n- Cigna offers a variety of health insurance plans designed to meet the minimum requirement for medical treatment coverage, with benefits reaching up to THB 3 million.

    "title": "De acoger instalaciones militares a ser una gran zona residencial: Getafe ultima su barrio de La Aviación",
    "text": "El Ayuntamiento de Getafe está inmerso en un ambicioso proyecto de transformación urbana que rehabilitará el Acuartelamiento Aéreo (ACAR) en un reformado y moderno barrio de La Aviación. Este proyecto busca reconfigurar una extensión de 220.000 metros cuadrados de terrenos militares en una área residencial y cultural, cuyo diseño se decidirá a través de un concurso internacional de ideas.\nEl concurso de ideas, según anunció la alcaldesa Sara Hernández, será abierto a urbanistas internacionales y estará enfocado en la creación de un diseño innovador . El objetivo de esta fórmula de procedimiento simplificado es agilizar los plazos y dinamizar el uso de las instalaciones actuales.\nEl proyecto, según cuenta Noticias para Municipios , contempla la construcción de 1.500 viviendas , de las cuales la mayoría serán de carácter público. Además, el plan incluirá la ampliación de la Universidad Carlos III, un auditorio municipal, nuevas instalaciones deportivas y áreas recreativas. Todo ello se articulará en un entorno que integrará usos residenciales, universitarios, comerciales y de servicios públicos y culturales.\nEste enfoque permitirá el uso inmediato de ciertas instalaciones del ACAR, optimizando así los tiempos y facilitando el inicio de algunas actividades en el corto plazo. Entre las medidas previstas destaca la creación de un aparcamiento provisional con 500 plazas , situado en la zona norte de los terrenos, que servirá para mejorar el acceso y la movilidad en la zona desde el principio.\nLa transformación del ACAR no se limitará solo a la construcción de viviendas. El nuevo barrio de La Aviación también contará con comercios locales, servicios públicos y espacios culturales , como lo demuestra su reciente función como anfitrión del festival Coca Cola Music Experience.\nReutilización de edificios Además, se está evaluando la reutilización provisional de algunos edificios militares para usos sociales y comunitarios. El objetivo es aprovechar las estructuras existentes del acuartelamiento mientras se lleva a cabo el desarrollo del nuevo barrio. Entre estos usos provisionales, se incluye la apertura del pabellón deportivo del ACAR para actividades deportivas y recreativas de los residentes.\nEl proyecto también contempla la protección y reutilización sostenible de los edificios históricos presentes en el ACAR . Estos elementos patrimoniales serán integrados en el nuevo diseño urbano, conservando su valor histórico y arquitectónico mientras se les da un nuevo propósito dentro de la comunidad. Esta acción refleja el compromiso del Ayuntamiento de Getafe con la preservación del legado cultural de la ciudad.\n[Hernández, alcaldesa de Getafe: \"El sur no puede seguir siendo el vertedero del norte\"] Una de las iniciativas clave para la conectividad del nuevo barrio será la creación de una nueva calle que unirá el barrio de Juan de la Cierva con la avenida John Lennon (M-406) . Esta infraestructura mejorará la integración del barrio con el resto de la ciudad, facilitando el acceso y fomentando la cohesión urbana.\nLa colaboración con la Universidad Carlos III es otra piedra angular del proyecto. La ampliación de la universidad en los terrenos del ACAR no solo aportará valor académico, sino que también abrirá oportunidades para desarrollar proyectos de innovación y educación que beneficiarán tanto a la comunidad local como a la región. Esta sinergia fortalecerá la economía local y promoverá el espíritu emprendedor entre los jóvenes de Getafe .\nEn cuanto a la reubicación de las instalaciones militares del Regimiento de Artillería de Campaña (RACA), el proceso de licitación está programado para principios de 2025 .\nLos militares se trasladarán a otras localizaciones, concretamente a Torrejón de Ardoz, Cuatro Vientos y a la parte del acuartelamiento que no ha sido adquirida por el Ayuntamiento. Esta reubicación marcará un hito significativo en la transformación del ACAR y permitirá que el desarrollo del nuevo barrio avance sin obstáculos.\n30 años a sus espaldas En 1991, se creó el Mando Aéreo del Centro (MACEN), renombrando la unidad como el Grupo del Cuartel General del MACEN. Ya en 1998, la unidad se desactivó y se creó la Agrupación del Acuartelamiento Aéreo de Getafe , trasladando la unidad a Getafe. Este cambio implicó una reorganización del acuartelamiento, que ya albergaba otras unidades.\nEl ACAR Getafe ha acogido varias agrupaciones y centros logísticos, cumpliendo funciones de seguridad, administración y apoyo logístico. Hasta 2005, la Agrupación tuvo la misión de rendir honores en ceremonias militares , una tarea que continúa con la Unidad de Música de la agrupación. La creación del ACAR Getafe se ha integrado en el legado histórico y organizativo del Ejército del Aire, reflejado en sus emblemas y escudos.\n[El misterio de El Corte Inglés de Arroyosur: el gran centro comercial de Madrid que sigue sin abrir tras el Covid] Ya en febrero de 2019, Defensa manifestó a la alcaldesa su disposición a evaluar la viabilidad de ceder a la ciudad parte de los terrenos del ACAR. El Ministerio se abrió a iniciar estudios de viabilidad y elaborar un borrador de protocolo de las actuaciones a seguir, que posteriormente sería analizado y consensuado con el Ayuntamiento de Getafe.\nSara Hernández y el rector de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Juan Romo, ya habían solicitado a la ministra de Defensa, Margarita Robles, la posibilidad de ampliar la universidad en estas instalaciones. La colaboración continua entre la Universidad Carlos III y el Ayuntamiento de Getafe mediante un grupo de trabajo sirvió para coordinar el porcentaje que Ayuntamiento y Universidad utilizarían. Ya entonces el consistorio mostraba su compromiso con la construcción de vivienda pública.",
