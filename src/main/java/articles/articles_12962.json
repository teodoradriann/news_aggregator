    "text": "Vietnamese, Lao businesswomen share experiences in green economic development Friday, 20:11, 05/07/2024 A forum connecting female entrepreneurs of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia was held in Hanoi on July 5, with discussions focusing on green economy.\nDelegates attending the forum (Photo: VNA) Addressing the event, Bui Thi Minh Hoai, Politburo member, Secretary of the Party Central Committee and Chairwoman of its Commission for Mass Mobilisation, stressed that participating in green economic development involves various stakeholders, with businesses being one of the most crucial. Businesswomen, in particular, are an indispensable force in green growth strategies, contributing to shaping a sustainable growth ecosystem.\nTo further unleash the potential and strengths of female entrepreneurs, Hoai proposed the women's unions of the three countries actively collaborate, share experiences in disseminating, raising awareness, and supporting members and women in green and circular economic development.\nEnterprises, especially those led by women, should continue to pioneer and proactively adopt innovative measures to enhance the efficiency of production and business aligned with strategic goals on greenhouse gas emission reduction and promotion of clean and renewable energy use, she said.\nChairwoman of the Vietnam Women's Union Ha Thi Nga stated that agencies and organisations, particularly those representing entrepreneurs and female ones, have been actively engaged in activities and initiatives to enhance their roles in green economy.\nNga called on women from the three countries to cooperate and unite in supporting the empowerment of women in economic affairs, and actively contributing to green economy and a more sustainable future. The three women's unions were recommended to continue to promote supportive initiatives and accompany women and businesswomen on their journey to contribute to the green economic development of each country; and integrate content and initiatives on green economic development into bilateral cooperation agreements between the Vietnam Women's Union and those of Laos and Cambodia at both central and local levels.\nPointing out to several existing shortcomings, President of the Lao Women's Union Aly Vongnobountham showed her hope that the three unions will collaborate to discuss cooperation plans and exchange experiences for the development of women; promote environmentally friendly goods production and climate change adaptation; and utilise technology to create jobs and stable incomes, thus helping women step-by-step get rid of poverty.\nKyong Sorita, Secretary of State of the Cambodian Ministry of Women’s Affairs, shared that the Cambodian Government has initiated the first phase of its pentagonal strategy - a strategy for socio-economic development aimed at promoting gender equality and empowering women and children. She added that women are a priority in the political agenda.\nIn the digital economy, the government is investing in digital infrastructure and education to enhance women's participation in this field, thus creating a favourable environment where women feel safe and protected, she said.\nVNA",

Veja o vídeo View this post on Instagram Furacão Milton perde força e vira ciclone O Centro Nacional de Furacões dos Estados Unidos (NHC, na sigla em inglês) anunciou nesta quinta-feira (10/10) que o f uracão Milton perdeu força e as características tropicais. Agora, ele é considerado um \"ciclone pós-tropical com força de furacão\". A última atualização do NHC, às 17h (horário dos EUA), informava que todos os alertas de tempestades e tempestades tropicais foram descontinuados e que este seria o último aviso sobre o Furacão Milton. Em pronunciamento, o presidente Joe Biden reforçou que as medidas de precaução ainda devem ser seguidas. \"A todos os afetados pelo furacão Milton: peço que fiquem em casa e longe das estradas. Linhas de energia caídas, escombros e estradas destruídas estão criando condições perigosas. A ajuda está a caminho, mas até que ela chegue, fique abrigado até que as autoridades locais digam que é seguro sair\", pontuou. Saiba Mais Gostou da matéria?

    "text": "Members of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) bloc have reaffirmed their loyalty to President Bola Tinubu and the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nThe defunct CPC is former President Muhammadu Buhari's party. It merged with others to form the APC and eventually kicked out the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from power in 2015 after the latter had ruled for 16 years.\nOther parties that formed the merger include the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), and a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).\nMeanwhile, there have been speculations about a purported move by the CPC bloc to exit the APC over the Tinubu administration's alleged marginalisation.\nALSO READ: PDP leaders are secretly backing APC – coalition alleges\nThe reports come amid growing talks by main opposition leaders to form a big coalition ahead of the 2027 elections to challenge the ruling APC.\nHowever, in a statement issued after a meeting on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, the CPC bloc described the rumoured defection of their members as “false and mischievous.”\nThey reiterated that they “remain resolutely committed to the APC,” describing the party as a “collective project” that must be protected.\n“We, the undersigned leaders and committed members of the former Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), who were part of those instrumental in the historic merger that gave birth to the All Progressives Congress (APC), hereby issue this statement to clarify our unalloyed loyalty to our great party and express firm solidarity with the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR,” the statement reads.\n“We wish to state categorically that we have neither left the APC nor do we intend to leave.\n“The CPC bloc remains one of the legacy foundations of the APC, and we are resolute in our commitment to the party and its progressive ideals.”\nCPC bloc is proud to be part of the APC\nAt the same time, bloc members stressed that they are proud of the sacrifices made to build the APC and warned against any attempt to dismantle the platform.\n“We will not allow some people to dismantle the party we helped to build through years of tireless work and dedication,” the group said.\nThe former CPC members described ongoing efforts to sow a seed of discord in the ruling party as an act of “division and desperation” that they “totally reject.”\n“We align ourselves fully with the economic and governance reforms being undertaken by President Bola Tinubu,” the CPC leaders said.\n“Though challenging, these policies are necessary steps to rebuild our economy and secure a better future for all Nigerians.\n“We urge patience and collective support as the benefits unfold; while we acknowledge that some party members may feel sidelined, we emphasise that such grievances are not exclusive to any one bloc.\nALSO READ: Ganduje declares NNPP 'dead' as Kwankwaso plots APC return\n“We advise those concerned to seek redress through constitutional channels within the party and not to resort to negative public agitation or hasty exits from the party.”\nThe statement was signed by 23 leaders of the defunct party, including former governors of Katsina and Nasarawa, Aminu Masari and Umaru Al-Makura, respectively; Adamu Adamu, former education minister; and Farouk Aliyu, former member of the House of Representatives.\nOthers include Lucy Ajayi, former executive director of the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex Management Board; Okoi Obono-Obla, former presidential aide; and Osita Okechukwu, former director-general of the Voice of Nigeria (VON).",

    "title": "Google is bringing its AI photo editing features for both Android and iPhone users for free",
    "text": "The AI features exclusive to the photo editor were once key attractions for Google's premium Pixel smartphones and its cloud storage service, Google One. However, amid the surge in AI-based editing tools entering the market, Google has decided to offer its AI photo editing suite to a broader audience for free.\nGoogle AI features availability for Android and iOS\nHowever, even with the free availability, this rollout comes with certain conditions. Users will need to meet specific hardware requirements to use these features. For ChromeOS, a Chromebook Plus with ChromeOS version 118 or higher, or a minimum of 3GB RAM, is necessary. Mobile devices must operate on Android 8.0 or above, or iOS 15 or above. Pixel tablets will also gain support.\nIf your phone meets the requirements, the availability of these tools will commence on May 15 and will gradually reach all Google Photos users over several weeks.\nGoogle Magic Editor features\nOne of the standout features, Magic Editor, was introduced with the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. It uses generative AI for complex photo edits, such as filling in photo gaps, repositioning subjects, and altering photo backgrounds. This tool automates tasks that previously required manual intervention with tools like Magic Eraser or Photoshop.\nFollowing the update, all Pixel devices will include Magic Editor, while iOS and Android users meeting the criteria will receive 10 Magic Editor saves monthly. Exceeding this limit will require a premium Google One plan with at least 2TB of storage.\nOther than Magic Erasers, there are more features available in Google Photos. All Google Photos users will have access to the complete range of features, including Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Sky suggestions, Colour pop, HDR effects, Portrait Blur, Portrait Light, Cinematic Photos, Collage Editor Styles, and Video Effects, without needing a Google One subscription.\nAs the name suggests, these features will allow users to perform editing like:\n- Replace dull skies with vibrant blue hues\n- Effortlessly remove unwanted objects from backgrounds\n- Recentre subjects while seamlessly filling in empty spaces\n- Perform a variety of foreground and background edits developed to simplify mobile editing\nPreviously, achieving these effects required painstaking manual work in tools like Photoshop. Magic Editor streamlines the process, making it accessible to everyone.\nHowever, the AI-powered Best Take feature, which combines similar photos to produce the optimal image, will remain exclusive to the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro models.\nOnePlus, Oppo collaborate with Google to bring advanced AI to smartphones Xiaomi Ultra 14 first sale in India today: Price, specifications OnePlus Open to get new update, will let users control every app's volume",
