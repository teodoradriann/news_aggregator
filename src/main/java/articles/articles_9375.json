    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Obiettivo 2028. È l’anno cerchiato in rosso, la luce in fondo al tunnel quando saranno trascorsi 50 anni dall’inizio dei lavori al Rione Terra di Pozzuoli. Un pantano da cui si cerca di uscirne fuori dopo l’inchiesta su corruzione e turbativa d’asta che hanno inquinato l’appalto per il primo dei tre lotti e che ha rallentato ogni processo di rilancio dell’antica rocca flegrea. Ora si cerca di svoltare definitivamente a Pozzuoli con tre nuove deadline: estate 2025, autunno 2026 e fine 2028.\nLa decisione\nLe basi per il primo obiettivo sono state fissate dall’amministrazione comunale che, dopo aver annullato il bando per il gestore unico, ha suddiviso il patrimonio del Rione Terra in due tipologie: economico e culturale. Nella prima rientrano fin da subito 44 botteghe, 3 ristoranti, 5 bar e 210 camere (per 450 posti letto) che saranno oggetto di bandi singoli per concessioni pluriennali. Per la parte culturale, invece, la gestione sarà in capo a una Fondazione di partecipazione che sarà composta da rappresentanti nominati dal comune di Pozzuoli, dal Ministero dei beni culturali – parco archeologico dei Campi Flegrei - e dalla Diocesi.\nLa Fondazione sarà chiamata a soprintendere i beni a carattere storico e culturali quali il museo di città, il museo archeologico, la galleria d’arte contemporanea, il museo diocesano, il tempio-cattedrale e il percorso archeologico sotterraneo. Tra i beni del comune di Pozzuoli, rientrerà anche il Castello che affaccia sulla Darsena. Tornando al lotto A, per la parte del Rione Terra che sarà data in concessione ai privati, sono in corso di definizione i processi espropriativi e l’intesa tra i vari enti proprietari dei vari beni, ultimo tassello mancante prima dell’indizione del bando di gara che entro Natale dovrà passare prima all’esame della giunta comunale e poi all’approvazione del consiglio comunale.\nI fondi\nPer la voce espropri, il comune di Pozzuoli ha ricevuto finora 4 milioni di euro dalla Regione Campania a cui si sommeranno altri 15 in arrivo per il prossimo anno. Una volta assegnato il primo lotto, sarà applicato lo stesso schema anche per i lotti B e C per i quali il termine dei lavori è stato fissato in 18 mesi per il primo e 36 mesi per il secondo. Opere che saranno finanziate con ulteriori 54 milioni di euro in arrivo dal Fondo di Coesione, per l’intero lotto B e per una parte del terzo.\n«Stiamo risolvendo, finalmente, problematiche che purtroppo nel passato non erano sta affrontate, quali gli espropri da portare a termine con i relativi fondi finanziari dalla regione, oppure l’ineludibile intesa istituzionale per la gestione dell’intero bene con Ministero e Diocesi di Pozzuoli. - spiega l’assessore al governo del territorio Giacomo Bandiera - Poi, procederemo con l’attuazione di quel che oramai da anni è il nostro intendimento: approccio duplice all’intero bene culturale territoriale del Rione Terra. Quindi bandi di concessione per la sua valenza economica e per le attività economiche previste. Quindi nascita di una Fondazione di partecipazione, per la gestione della valenza culturale del Rione Terra. Entro il periodo natalizio tutto sarà delineato e approvato dal Consiglio Comunale con una delibera d’indirizzo, entro l’estate procederemo ai bandi e alla nascita della Fondazione Rione Terra».",

    "text": "Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon recently shared a deeply emotional post on Instagram, reflecting the bittersweet journey of watching her children grow up and prepare to leave “the nest.” In a heartfelt post, Raveena shared touching throwback images of her four children – daughter Rasha, son Ranbir and adopted daughters Pooja and Chhaya – alongside more recent snapshots. The carousel begins with nostalgic photos of young Rasha and Ranbir, playfully splashing in a pool and hugging their mother. Following these are recent snapshots of the duo, showing how much they have grown. Raveena also includes cherished childhood pictures of Pooja and Chhaya alongside their recent images. The collection beautifully captures adorable family moments, from travelling adventures to attending special events together. The series concludes with a breathtaking image of Raveena posing with her three daughters, all elegantly dressed in matching white traditional attires. In her emotional note shared along with the pictures, Raveena opened up about the challenges every mother faces as her children mature and embark on their own paths. “How fast the time and tide carries us they, and then time to fly the nest. Most heartbreaking time for Moms to let go, they’ve been your, your focus of even everyday mundane things that now will seem so so precious,” Raveena wrote. She also extended her gratitude to her followers, asking them to shower her children with love and blessings, stating, “But then, give them wings, watch them fly.. with all the love and blessings of us and yours my dear insta fam… love them like your own.” See the post here: Raveena tied the knot with Indian film distributor, Anil Thadani on February 22, 2004. The couple welcomed their daughter, Rasha in 2005, followed by the birth of their son, Ranbir in 2005. Prior to her marriage, in 1995, Raveena adopted Pooja and Chhaya, as a single mother when they were 11 and 8 years old respectively. Meanwhile, on the professional front, Raveena recently appeared in the film Ghudchadi alongside actor Sanjay Dutt. Up next, she is set to reunite with Akshay Kumar in the upcoming comedy Welcome to the Jungle, directed by Ahmed Khan. The film also boasts a star-studded cast including Disha Patni, Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Lara Dutta and Paresh Rawal, among others. Reportedly, Welcome to the Jungle was scheduled to be released on December 20, 2025. However, the recent removal of the announcement video has sparked speculation that the film might be facing some challenges.",

    "text": "Los microplásticos y nanoplásticos están presentes en el aire, agua, alimentos y productos de consumo diario. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Los microplásticos y los nanoplásticos son partículas diminutas que provienen de la descomposición de plásticos más grandes o de productos fabricados directamente en tamaños pequeños.\nAmbos tipos de plásticos se encuentran distribuidos por todo el entorno, incluidos el aire, el agua, los alimentos y los productos de consumo diario. Su presencia en los tejidos humanos , especialmente en el cerebro, genera preocupaciones sobre sus posibles efectos en la salud.\nCientíficos de Canadá y los Estados Unidos publicaron un artículo en Brain Medicine, publicada por Genomic Press que compila pruebas de diversos estudios y advirtieron: “El aumento de los niveles de microplásticos y nanoplásticos ( MNP ) en el tejido cerebral humano es alarmante, especialmente en pacientes con demencia”.\nHay preocupación por el potencial efecto de los microplásticos y los nanoplásticos en el desarrollo de enfermedades neurodegenerativas como la demencia (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Los síntomas más frecuentes de esa afección neurodegenerativa son la pérdida de funciones cognitivas, como la memoria, el pensamiento y la capacidad para tomar decisiones.\nEn diálogo con Infobae , el doctor Ricardo Allegri , investigador en neurociencias del Conicet y del Fleni en la Argentina, expresó: “Es muy preocupante el problema de la contaminación por nanoplásticos y microplásticos en el mundo, más todavía cuando hay evidencia que posiblemente sea mayor en cerebros de pacientes con demencia. Las evidencias actuales deberían considerarse para planificar acciones que reduzcan esa contaminación”.\nSi bien en países como la Argentina la exposición puede ser menor que en Estados Unidos es una gran llamada de atención. Hoy debemos trabajar no solo en los factores de riesgo tradicionales, sino también en los contaminantes plásticos y en el impacto de los alimentos ultraprocesados en relación con el deterioro cognitivo y trabajar para contrarrestarlos”, sostuvo Allegri.\nQué diferencia hay entre microplásticos y nanoplásticos\nLa diferencia entre microplásticos y nanoplásticos reside en su tamaño/ REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado Los microplásticos tienen un tamaño menor a 5 milímetros, mientras que los nanoplásticos son aún más pequeños, con un tamaño inferior a 200 nanómetros.\nLa cantidad de nanopartículas y micropartículas plásticas en el medio ambiente, que varían en tamaño desde tan pequeñas como 1 nanómetro (una milmillonésima parte de un metro) hasta 500 micrómetros (una millonésima parte de un metro) de diámetro, aumentó exponencialmente en los últimos 50 años.\nA medida que la contaminación por plásticos crece, se hace cada vez más evidente que pueden tener efectos negativos en la salud humana. Recientemente, un estudio llevado a cabo por investigadores de los Estados Unidos y Colombia aportó más pruebas. Fue publicado en la revista Nature Medicine en febrero pasado.\nLas pequeñas partículas de plástico pueden acumularse en niveles más altos en el cerebro humano que en el riñón y el hígado, con concentraciones mayores detectadas en muestras post-mortem de 2024 que en las de 2016, señaló el grupo de científicos, que incluyó a María Zuluaga-Ruiz , del Grupo de Investigación en Rehabilitación de la Universidad del Valle (GIRUV), en Cali , Colombia.\nSe detectó una mayor acumulación de partículas plásticas en cerebros humanos recientes frente a muestras más antiguas (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) También encontraron una mayor concentración de partículas micro y nanoplásticas en 12 cerebros de individuos con diagnóstico documentado de demencia en comparación con otros que no tenían el trastorno.\nEsos hallazgos identificaron una asociación, pero no establecen un vínculo causal entre las partículas plásticas y los efectos en la salud. También los autores sugirieron que algo de variación en las muestras cerebrales podría deberse a diferencias geográficas.\nCómo los contaminantes ingresan en el cuerpo humano\nIdentificaron mayores concentraciones de partículas plásticas en cerebros de personas con demencia en comparación con quienes no padecen la enfermedad (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Según los autores del trabajo publicado en Brain Medicine , los microplásticos y los nanoplásticos penetran en el cuerpo humano a través de diversas rutas , como la ingestión, la inhalación o el contacto dérmico.\nLos investigadores son Nicholas Fabiano, del Departamento de Psiquiatría de la Universidad de Ottawa , y Brandon Luu, de l Departamento de Medicina Interna de la Universidad de Toronto , en Canadá. El tercer autor es David Puder, de la Escuela de Medicina de la Universidad Loma Linda , en California, Estados Unidos .\nMencionaron que los microplásticos en el cerebro pueden inducir estrés oxidativo, inflamación y disfunción inmune . Además, los nanoplásticos más pequeños (menos de 200 nanómetros) parecen tener una mayor capacidad para atravesar las barreras biológicas, lo que facilita su acumulación en los tejidos.\nEn modelos animales, se han observado alteraciones en la memoria y el aprendizaje debido a la presencia de MNPs en el cerebro. También se ha detectado que interfieren en el funcionamiento de células cerebrales, lo que podría contribuir a enfermedades neurodegenerativas como la demencia.\n¿Cómo protegerse de los microplásticos y los nanoplásticos?\nPara reducir la exposición a microplásticos y nanoplásticos, científicos sugirieron reemplazar el agua embotellada por agua de grifo(Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Los científicos sugirieron varias estrategias para reducir la exposición a los microplásticos y los nanoplásticos. Estas recomendaciones se enfocan principalmente en los cambios de hábitos en el día a día:\nReemplazar el agua embotellada por agua del grifo . Esta simple acción podría reducir la ingesta anual de microplásticos de 90.000 partículas a solo 4.000 . Evitar el uso de plásticos para almacenar y calentar alimentos , ya que el calentamiento en plástico libera grandes cantidades de partículas. Se recomienda “dejar de calentar alimentos en plásticos, especialmente en microondas, debido a la liberación de hasta 4.22 millones de partículas por centímetro cuadrado en solo tres minutos”, afirmaron. Reducir el consumo de alimentos altamente procesados , que a menudo están almacenados en plásticos. Este tipo de alimentos contienen muchas más partículas de microplásticos que los productos frescos. Usar contenedores de vidrio o acero inoxidable en lugar de plásticos para evitar la contaminación por MNPs. Evitar el uso de bolsitas de té plásticas , que liberan grandes cantidades de microplásticos al ser sumergidas en agua caliente. Eliminar el consumo de alimentos enlatados podría ser una estrategia eficaz para reducir la exposición, ya que el uso de bisfenol A (BPA) en las latas puede aumentar los niveles de microplásticos en el cuerpo. Mejorar las prácticas de almacenamiento de alimentos : usar recipientes de vidrio o acero inoxidable, que puede ser una acción clave para reducir la exposición a los microplásticos.\nSe aconsejó usar bolsitas de té no plásticas para limitar la contaminación por esas partículas (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Las recomendaciones apuntan a un cambio de estilo de vida que permita una reducción sustancial en la exposición a los contaminantes, aunque los autores reconocieron que aún falta más investigación para confirmar la eficacia de esas medidas a largo plazo.\nPor eso, hicieron un llamado a realizar más estudios a largo plazo, con poblaciones más grandes y diversas, para poder confirmar si las soluciones realmente son efectivas en la reducción de la exposición a los contaminantes y en la mejora de la salud humana a largo plazo.",

More content below ^GSPC Rita Nazareth 23 PM · 7 min read In this article: Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below ^GSPC\n(Bloomberg) -- The financial world was roiled by a flare-up in geopolitical risks that sent stocks sliding — while spurring a flight to the safest corners of the market such as bonds and the dollar. Oil rallied.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIsrael Bracing for Unprecedented Direct Iran Attack in Days\nApple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips\nRussian Attacks on Ukraine Stoke Fears Army Near Breaking Point\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies\nStocks Get Hit as War Jitters Fuel Rush to Bonds: Markets Wrap\nEquities pushed toward their worst day since January on a news report that Israel was bracing for an attack by Iran on government targets. Approximately 40 launches were identified crossing from Lebanese territory, some of which were intercepted, the Israel Defense Forces said in a post on X around 1:40 p.m. New York time. US President Joe Biden said he expects Iran will attack Israel sooner rather than later — and his message to Iran is don’t do it.\nWall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — spiked to levels last seen in October.\nTo Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, investors have been much too complacent about geopolitical issues.\n“Since gold and oil markets have been pricing in a meaningful impact on the marketplace from this crisis, it’s not out of the question that the stock market will follow those other markets and see an outsized reaction before long,” Maley noted.\nThe S&P 500 fell about 1.5% as 97% of its shares retreated, with banks and chipmakers leading losses. A gauge of small caps slid over 2%. Treasury 10-year yields sank eight basis points to 4.51%. Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities also cited “massive short covering” and rate locking amid an expected flurry of debt issuance by banks after earnings.\nThe dollar headed toward its best week since September 2022. Oil jumped to the highest since October. The greenback hit the highest in 2024. Gold broke the $2,400-an-ounce mark before erasing gains.\nStory continues As Iran Threatens Attack, These Are Israel’s Defenses: QuickTake\n“Risk was off the menu on Friday,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “Investors were lighting up on risk exposure ahead of the weekend, fearing risk assets could gap lower should something happen.”\nA direct confrontation between Israel and Iran would mean a significant escalation of the Middle East conflict and would lead to a significant rise in oil prices, according to Commerzbank analysts including Carsten Fritsch.\nEscalating geopolitical tensions — most recently in the Middle East but also including attacks on Russian energy infrastructure by Ukraine — have spurred bullish activity in the oil options market. There’s been elevated buying of call options — which profit when prices rise — in recent days, as implied volatility climbs.\nJose Torres at Interactive Brokers says the latest developments illustrate how investor sentiment and high equity valuations are vulnerable to geopolitical conflicts, persistent inflation and oil prices.\n“Investors have pushed back their expectations for the start of the Fed’s easing cycle — with geopolitics possibly replacing the Fed as one of the market’s top volatility influencers,” he noted.\nMeantime, big banks’ results offered the latest window into how the US economy is faring amid an interest-rate trajectory muddied by persistent inflation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. both reported net interest income — the earnings they generate from lending — that missed estimates amid increasing funding costs. Citigroup Inc.’s profit topped forecasts as corporations tapped markets for financing and consumers leaned on credit cards — signs that a prolonged period of elevated interest rates will benefit large lenders.\n“Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” JPMorgan’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. He cited the wars, growing geopolitical tensions, persistent inflationary pressures and the effects of quantitative tightening.\nTreasuries rallied sharply, following the market’s worst two days since February, in which yields reached year-to-date highs after inflation readings savaged expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Two-year yields — which briefly topped 5% this week — plunged on Friday.\nAnd the latest economic data did little to alter the reduced risk appetite — with consumer sentiment down as inflation expectations rose.\nBlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he expects the Fed to cut rates twice at the most this year, and that it will be difficult for the central bank to curb inflation.\nFink told CNBC he would “call it a day and a win” if the inflation rate gets to between 2.8% and 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target.\nMeantime, Pacific Investment Management Co. warned that the Fed could pivot back toward interest rate hikes if US inflation moves higher — with the asset manager preferring to buy bonds in other markets.\n“If inflation starts to re-emerge then there’s a possibility that the Fed hikes instead of delivering any cuts,” Mohit Mittal, chief investment officer for core strategies at Pimco, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins reiterated she sees no urgency to cut rates in the near term, given elevated inflation and the resilience of the labor market. Her Chicago counterpart Austan Goolsbee repeated that housing inflation will need to come down in order for overall prices to cool to the central bank’s target. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said officials should wait for “clear and convincing” evidence that inflation is headed back toward 2%.\nFed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic stuck to his expectation for one interest-rate cut this year, while maintaining flexibility to adjust as needed.\nWhile shifting expectations around the timing and pace of the first cuts are likely to create further yield volatility in the near term, UBS’s Chief Investment Office thinks the more important point is that the US central bank remains set to start easing this year.\nWith a low probability of the Fed needing to hike rates further, CIO maintains their positive outlook on quality bonds.\n“We continue to favor quality bonds in our global portfolios and recommend investors lock in attractive yields before rates fall this year,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We like those with 1–10-year duration, as well as sustainable bonds. We also think investors should consider an active exposure to fixed income to improve diversification.”\nCorporate Highlights:\nUnited States Steel Corp. shareholders voted in favor of a $14.1 billion takeover offer by Nippon Steel Corp., leaving the fate of the deal for the iconic American steelmaker to the realm of US regulators and politics.\nBlackRock Inc.’s long-term investment funds took in $76 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, helping to push the world’s largest money manager to of client assets.\nState Street Corp. reported adjusted earnings per share and net interest income for the first quarter that beat the average analyst estimate.\nGlobal Life Inc. issued a statement on a short-seller report, saying it “reviewed the report and found it to be wildly misleading.”\nExxon Mobil Corp. formally approved its sixth Guyanese oil development that will make the Latin American nation a bigger crude producer than OPEC member Venezuela.\nBeijing has ordered telecom carriers like China Mobile Ltd. to replace foreign chips in their core networks by 2027, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nActivist investor Barington Capital Group L.P. is calling on Paramount Global to end exclusive talks with media mogul David Ellison and consider rival proposals, including one from Apollo Global Management Inc.\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.7% as of 3:19 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.9%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%\nThe MSCI World index fell 1.4%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%\nThe euro fell 0.8% to $1.0639\nThe British pound fell 0.8% to $1.2447\nThe Japanese yen was little changed at 153.19 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 5.3% to $66,792.51\nEther fell 8.5% to $3,224\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined eight basis points to 4.51%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 2.36%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 4.14%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.4% to $85.35 a barrel\nSpot gold fell 1.4% to $2,338.56 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n--With assistance from Isabelle Lee, Caleb Mutua, Alex Longley, Jack Wittels, Jack Ryan, Sybilla Gross, Michael Mackenzie, Michael Msika and Carter Johnson.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\nToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai\nRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers\nCocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the Bean\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

    "text": "TORONTO — Chris Bassitt declared everyone in the Toronto Blue Jays organization should bear the blame for its shoddy season.\nBassitt (8-9) made his remarks after the Tampa Bay Rays (52-51) throttled the Blue Jays (46-56) 13-0 with 16 hits in the rubber match of their three-game series on Thursday.\n“I would say there’s not a single person in probably the whole organization who's not disappointed right now,\" Bassitt said.\n“It just sucks. I don’t think anyone thought this is what was going to happen.\n“I don’t think there’s one person with clean hands right now. I really don’t think we’ve done anything well this year. Well, maybe (Daulton) Varsho’s defence.\n“Besides Varsho’s defence, I don’t see how anyone can say ‘I’ve done what I should.'\"\nBassitt also remarked that the embarrassing loss was because the team has been fighting \"demons.\"\nWhat did he mean?\n“Everything that’s been going on,\" Bassitt said.\n\"It’s whatever it might be, giving up that many hits, not being able to hit and the trade deadline. Who’s going to be here, who’s not going to be here? There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.\"\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,\" Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn't sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,\" Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. \"But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n\"When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTaj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits. Rosario pounded a double and two singles.\nON THE MEND\nBlue Jays utility infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) could begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, provided there are no setbacks, according to Schneider.\nKiner-Falefa has been out since July 1 and has enjoyed a solid season with a .292 average and .338 on-base percentage.\nON DECK\nThe Blue Jays begin a three-game set against the Texas Rangers on Friday to conclude their nine-outing, 10-day homestand. Toronto's Yusei Kikuchi (4-9) will open the series against lefty Andrew Heaney (4-10).\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nTim Wharnsby, The Canadian Press",
