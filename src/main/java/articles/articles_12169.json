    "title": "The Potential of THCV for Weight Loss: A Deep Dive into CANNA LEAN",
    "text": "When it comes to managing appetite and supporting weight control, THCV for weight loss has become a promising option for those seeking natural solutions. Prime Sunshine’s CANNA LEAN for Appetite and Weight Control harnesses the power of THCV, offering a unique approach to weight management. As a stimulant, THCV offers potential benefits for appetite suppression, giving you an alternative to traditional weight loss supplements. Below, we delve into how this product works, what makes THCV distinct, and why it might be the perfect addition to your wellness journey.\nUnderstanding THCV: How It Works and Its Benefits THCV, or tetrahydrocannabivarin, is a lesser-known cannabinoid that interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS) much like its better-known counterparts, THC and CBD. However, THCV supplements work differently, especially in the context of appetite regulation. While THC binds to the CB1 receptors in the brain to stimulate hunger, THCV turns off these receptors , potentially leading to a decrease in appetite and a more energetic feeling. This makes it an attractive option for those interested in weight loss.\nPrime Sunshine is at the forefront of THCV innovation, being the first to offer a purified THCV oil and THCV-CBD blend. This advancement allows users to explore the appetite-suppressing benefits of THCV without the typical psychoactive effects associated with THC. If you’re looking to try THCV for weight loss , this product could be the right fit.\nWhat Sets CANNA LEAN Apart? CANNA LEAN for Appetite and Weight Control is designed to deliver the unique benefits of THCV, making it ideal for those seeking a natural solution to manage their appetite and weight. Here’s why it stands out:\nAppetite Suppression: As THCV works by blocking CB1 receptors, it helps reduce hunger and cravings, making it a suitable supplement for those looking to lose weight. Non-Intoxicating: Unlike THC, THCV does not produce a “high” when taken in typical doses. This allows users to enjoy its stimulating and clear-headed effects without the psychoactive experience. Energy Boost: Users report feeling more energized when using THCV, making it a great option for those who want a natural way to support their active lifestyle. For those curious about how this product might support their weight loss goals, CANNA LEAN THCV gummies offer a convenient and effective way to incorporate this cannabinoid into your routine. THCV gummies for weight loss have become increasingly popular due to their easy-to-use format and consistent dosing.\nWhy Choose THCV Over Traditional Supplements? Unlike many weight loss supplements that rely on caffeine or synthetic stimulants, THCV supplements offer a natural way to manage appetite. Because THCV interacts directly with the ECS, it has a more targeted approach to appetite control. This makes THCV pills and THCV capsules a preferred choice for individuals who want a plant-based solution for weight management.\nPrime Sunshine’s CANNA LEAN for Appetite and Weight Control is designed with this in mind. As Ellen Tacher, CEO of Prime Sunshine , notes, “Cannabis as a Medicine Works.” This philosophy is reflected in every batch of CANNA LEAN, ensuring that each user can find the right balance for their unique needs.\nHow to Incorporate CANNA LEAN into Your Wellness Routine If you’re considering THCV for weight loss , starting with CANNA LEAN THCV gummies is a great way to test its effects. These gummies offer a simple and precise dose, allowing you to monitor how THCV influences your appetite and energy levels. Over time, you may find that they help you maintain a balanced diet without the usual cravings, making weight management more attainable.\nFor those who prefer capsules, Prime Sunshine offers THCV capsules that can be easily integrated into your daily regimen. Visit the THCV capsules product category page to explore more options.\nCommon Questions About THCV for Weight Loss Q1: Does THCV work for weight loss?\nA: While research is still ongoing, THCV for weight loss shows promise as a natural appetite suppressant. It works by blocking the CB1 receptor, which can help reduce hunger and cravings.\nQ2: How should I use CANNA LEAN for appetite control?\nA: It’s best to start with a low dose, such as one CANNA LEAN THCV gummy or THCV pill , and observe how it affects your appetite and energy. You can gradually increase the dose if needed .\nQ3: Can I use THCV with other supplements?\nA: Yes, THCV supplements can be combined with other cannabinoids like CBD for a more tailored approach to your wellness needs. However, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before adding new supplements to your routine.\nQ4: Is THCV safe to use daily?\nA: Yes, THCV is considered safe for daily use, especially when taken in the recommended doses. Prime Sunshine offers high-quality, lab-tested THCV products to ensure purity and potency.\nA Natural Solution to Appetite Control: Try CANNA LEAN Today If you’re looking for a natural, non-intoxicating way to manage your appetite and support your weight loss journey, THCV for weight loss could be a game-changer. Prime Sunshine’s CANNA LEAN for Appetite and Weight Control offers a high-quality option that makes it easier than ever to incorporate this innovative cannabinoid into your lifestyle.

    "title": "Sweden finally joins Nato after months of wrangling – meaning Putin has another member on his doorstep",
    "text": "Sweden has officially joined Nato – ending decades of post-Second World War neutrality to become the alliance’s second new member since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe ratification cements Nato’s presence in the Nordic region with all countries now members, and makes the Baltic essentially a “Nato sea” right on Vladimir Putin’s doorstep.\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken presided at a ceremony in which Sweden’s “instrument of accession” to the alliance was officially deposited at the State Department.\n“This is a historic moment for Sweden. It’s historic for alliance. It’s history for the transatlantic relationship,” Mr Blinken said as he welcomed the 32nd country into the group. “Our Nato alliance is now stronger, larger than it’s ever been.”\nThe Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described it as “a historic day,” adding: “After over 200 years of non-alignment Sweden now enjoys the protection granted under Article 5, the ultimate guarantee of Allies’ freedom and security”.\nArticle 5 of Nato’s treaty obliges all members to come to the aid of an ally whose territory or security is under threat. It has only been activated once – by the US after the 11 September, 2001, attacks – and is the collective security guarantee that Sweden has sought since Russia invaded Ukraine.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, right, accepts Sweden’s instruments of accession from Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson (Reuters)\nFinland and Sweden both applied to join the defence alliance in the wake of Russian President Putin ordering the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While Finland officially joined Nato last April, Sweden’s bid was held up by Hungary and Turkey.\nTurkey expressed concern that Sweden was harboring and not taking enough action against members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is deemed a terrorist group by Ankara, the US and the EU. The Turkish parliament finally gave approval in January. As for Hungary, it continued to drag its feet, without ever being so clear about the reasons for its objections. Populist\nPresident Viktor Orban is Putin’s closest ally in Europe, and has been a block on EU-wide funding for Ukraine. Some have suggested that Orban has sought to play up his nation’s military and economic leverage to look strong to a domestic audience. Hungary finally ratified in the decision within the last week.\n“Good things come to those who wait. No better example,” Mr Blinken said.\nThe White House said that having Sweden as a Nato ally “will make the United States and our allies even safer.”\nA Ukrainian serviceman from air defence unit of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade fires a AK-74 assault rifle on the eastern frontline near Bakhmut (REUTERS)\n“Nato is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our alliance was founded out of the wreckage of the Second World War,” it said in a statement.\nMr Kristersson was due to visit the White House and then be a guest of honor at President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address to Congress late on Thursday. Mr Biden is expected to cite Sweden’s accession to Nato as evidence that Putin’s intent to divide and weaken the alliance has failed as a direct result of the Ukraine invasion. He is also set to use Sweden’s decision to join to step up calls for reluctant Republicans to approved stalled military assistance to Ukraine as the war enters its third year.\nUkraine has been facing Russian advances in eastern areas of the 600-mile frontline while having to contend with shortages of ammunition. While the EU has managed to overcome Orban’s objections to push through some fresh funding, the US Congress still cannot agree. As Washington is the single largest supplier of military aid to Kyiv, Ukrainian officials have urged the US to agree new funds as soon as possible, as it is having a direct impact on the frontline.\nThe Swedish flag will be raised outside the military organization’s headquarters in Brussels on Monday. “Sweden will now take its rightful place at Nato’s table, with an equal say in shaping Nato policies and decisions,” Mr Stoltenberg said in his statement.\n“Sweden’s accession makes Nato stronger, Sweden safer and the whole alliance more secure,” he added. He said that the move “demonstrates that Nato’s door remains open and that every nation has the right to choose its own path.”\nSweden has already got a taste of military exercises with Nato. Nordic response, a first-of-its-time training venture was launched in recent days across northern Norway, Sweden and Finland. The exercises across land, air and sea involve more than 20,000 troops from 13 nations, including the UK.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "title": "Grant allows Renton to add eight new electric vehicle chargers",
    "text": "In a continuing effort to move toward a full fleet of electric vehicles, the City of Renton acquired eight new electric vehicle charging plugs through a grant from the Washington Department of Commerce. With the grant, the city will purchase and install four level 2 electric vehicle charging plugs at City Hall and four level 2 electric vehicle charging plugs at the public works maintenance facility. They will also construct stub-outs, allowing additional chargers to be built in the future. City public works administrator Martin Pastucha said the city was awarded $74,000 of grant revenue that requires a match of $25,000. Pastucha said the city would meet this requirement with funds from Puget Sound Energy’s Up and Go rebate program, which provides a rebate of $16,000, and they will also utilize $9,000 from the city fleet budget. Pastucha said these new chargers will add to the six current charging ports at City Hall and four charging ports at the city maintenance shops. He said having this additional capacity will allow the city to add more vehicles to the fleet and have the capacity for them to charge. Pastucha said the city has been developing a plan to transition its fleet from traditional gas vehicles to electric vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Pastucha said that this move is consistent with the city council’s goal to reduce Renton’s environmental impact on the community. “We know one of the things we need to do is you can’t just buy a car, you have a place to charge it,” Pastucha said. “So part of this was to take a look at where we can develop both the acquisition of vehicles, but also the development of a charging infrastructure so that the cars can be charged during evening hours when people are at work and then be ready to go for the next day.” Pastucha said Renton is more easily able to replace some of their regular cars with vehicles such as Chevy Bolts, but right now, with the limited technology of electric vehicles, they still cannot replace some of their work trucks such as dump trucks, snowplows, or street sweepers. Pastucha said when vehicles begin to approach retirement, they will try to replace those with electric SUVs. Pastucha said engineering teams use electric vehicles to go from site to site, code enforcement carries tools, and the police department has a couple of Chevy Bolts they use for non-emergency purposes. “It’s not going to take the act of one person to make this change.

Source: Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, during a visit to Estonia, as reported by Belgian public service broadcaster [RTBF](https://www.rtbf.be/article/guerre-en-ukraine-l-union-europeenne-aura-la-capacite-de-produire-13-million-d-obus-d-ici-la-fin-de-l-annee-annonce-thierry-breton-11315950) Quote: \"We will continue to improve our production capacity, probably to 1.3-1.4 million by the end of this year, and we will continue to increase it significantly next year.\" Details: The European Commissioner declined to disclose current production figures, saying they were classified. \"With this capacity to produce a million shells, we have to make sure that most of them get to Ukraine as a priority. Because that's where they are most needed,\" Breton added. Breton said that the EU would reach its goal of having a production capacity of one million shells a year by March or April 2024. \"We are at a decisive moment for our collective security in Europe, and in the war of aggression waged by Russia in Ukraine, Europe must and will continue to support Ukraine with all its resources,\" he added. Background: - Breton recently proposed the idea of creating a €100 billion European Union Defence Fund and called for an increase in weapons production to match Russia's potential. - \"I am convinced that we will do it,\" he said, adding that EU leaders will discuss the issue at [the summit on 1 February](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2024/01/9/7177090/). The decision to allocate money from the EU budget for the defence industry must be approved by the European Council. - He also stated that achieving the goal of supplying Ukraine with one million artillery shells by spring 2024 would require a reduction in exports to non-EU countries and pressure from member governments on their own arms industry to increase production. - European Pravda reported earlier how Europe's efforts to increase arms production and help Ukraine fight the Russian invasion [had hit an unexpected obstacle in the form](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/12/28/7434888/)of German local authorities.

    "text": "For almost a century, laboratory studies have shown that eating fewer amounts of food, or eating less frequently, prolongs the life of those in the laboratory. However, it was not understood why these types of restrictive diets work to extend lifespan and, most importantly, how to best implement them in humans.\nNow, a study published in ‘ Nature ‘ seems to provide a possible answer.\nA team of Jackson Laboratory (USA) monitored the health of almost a thousand mice on a variety of diets.\nEating fewer calories has a greater impact on longevity than periodic fasting. According to the study, very low-calorie diets prolonged the life of the mice, regardless of their body fat or glucose levels, both typically considered markers of health. metabolic and aging . Surprisingly, the mice that lived the longest on the restrictive diets were those that lost the least weight despite eating less. Animals that lost the most weight on these diets tended to have low energy, compromised immune and reproductive systems, and shorter lifespans.\nThe study was designed to ensure that each mouse was genetically distinct, allowing the team to better represent the genetic diversity of the human population.\n« Our study highlights the importance of resilience » says Gary Churchill, who led the study. «The strongest animals maintain their weight even in the face of stress and calorie restriction, and they are the ones that live the longest. “It also suggests that a more moderate level of calorie restriction could be the way to balance long-term health and longevity.”\nChurchill and his colleagues assigned female mice to five different diets: one in which the animals could freely eat any amount of food at any time; two in which the animals were given only 60% or 80% of their basic daily calories, and two others in which they were not given food for one or two consecutive days each week, but could eat whatever they wanted. the rest of the days.\nLifetime\nThe mice were then monitored for the rest of their lives with regular blood tests and a thorough assessment of their overall health.\nThe results showed that mice on unrestricted diets lived an average of 25 months, those on intermittent fasting diets lived an average of 28 months, those eating 80% of their base calories lived an average of 30 months, and those on They ate 60% of their basic calories and lived 34 months.\nBut within each group, the range of longevity was very wide; Mice that ate fewer calories, for example, had lifespans that ranged from a few months to four and a half years.\n#explain #calorie #restriction #diet #prolongs #life",

A descoberta é um importante passo no desenvolvimento de tratamentos para uma ampla gama de cânceres. Segundo os autores do estudo, investir no tratamento por meio desses genes supressores é uma forma de superar desafios relacionados à personalização de tratamentos, já que fornece uma solução única que pode ser usada para vários tipos de câncer. Como resultado, o estudo revelou a existência de 11 mil elementos cis-reguladores de manutenção (HK-CREs), uma parte da sequência do DNA humano que regula a transcrição dos genes. Esses elementos recebem o nome de interruptor genético em referência a um interruptor de tomada, já que podem, de forma simples, “ligar e desligar” as decodificações genéticas. Presentes em todos os tipos de células, os mecanismos descobertos pela pesquisa podem travar uma ”batalha intracelular” contra os tumores. “Cada pequeno conhecimento que obtivermos pode ser fundamental na batalha contínua contra esta doença, que tragicamente ceifou inúmeras vidas”, destacou o Dr. Martin Loza, um dos autores da pesquisa. O artigo foi publicado na edição de dezembro da Nucleic Acids Research.
