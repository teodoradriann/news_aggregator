    "title": "\"Non torniamo indietro per questa religione\", Rampini travolge il predicatore",
    "text": "Rampini travolge il predicatore: \"Non torniamo indietro per questa religione\"\nBrahim Baya il promotore della preghiera-comizio con la bandiera palestinese vista all'Unviversità di Torino, contro il \"genocidio a Gaza\", come ricorda lo stesso predicatore musulmano nel corso della puntata di sabato 25 maggio di In altre parole, il programma condotto da Massimo Gramellini su La7. L'ospite in collegamento rivendica il diritto di pregare in una università laica perché per manifestare la propria fede \"non c'è bisogno di un autorizzazione\", afferma sottolineando che la libertà religiosa è garantita dalla Costituzione. Tuttavia si è trattato di un comizio anti-Israele, fa notare Gramellini che ribatte: che reazione avrebbe se un rabbino facesse una preghiera contro Gaza davanti alla bandiera di Israele per di più dentro un ateneo? La giornalista Cecilia Sala fa poi notare a Baya le foto che ritraggono quel venerdì, in cui le donne sono serarate dagli uomini, dietro una grata, come avviene nelle moschee. Con la differenza che siamo in una università. Il predicatore ribatte che uomini e donne sono divisi anche nelle sinagoghe e nelle moschee, e un tempo anche nelle chiese.\nSul punto interviene anche Federico Rampini: \"Quella separazione lì non sta bene all'università. Ci ha appena ricordato che molti anni anche nelle chiese cattoliche c'era una separazione tra uomini e donne, ma noi abbiamo superato stadio\", attacca l'editorialista del Corriere della sera. \"Dobbiamo tornare indietro perché ce lo impone questa religione? - argomenta Rampini - Le conquiste delle donne italiane e in generale delle donne occidentali devono essere cancellate quando subentra una religione che decide di cancellarle?\", continua dando il merito a Sala di aver colto uno dei punti più indifendibili di quanto visto a Torino. \"Le donne italiane e le donne occidentali non sono pronte a rinunciare a questi diritti perché una religione lo impone\", conclude.\nDai blog\nControtempo []https://www.iltempo.it/blog/carlo-antini/2024/05/20/news/remo-anzovino-omaggio-lelio-luttazzi-futuro-opera-moderna-39374266/\n\"Nel mio futuro un'opera moderna\".

    "title": "3 F-16 Crashes in 9 Months in Korea, But USAF Says Mishaps Are Unrelated",
    "text": "Feb. 1, 2024 Share Article\nFollowing the third crash of a U.S. Air Force F-16 in South Korea in nine months on Jan. 31, the head of the 7th Air Force released a statement saying the incidents do not appear to be related.\nSome USAF flight operations have resumed on the Korean Peninsula after a brief pause, Maj. Gen. David Iverson added.\nThe latest crash occurred after the F-16 suffered an in-flight emergency over South Korea’s southwestern coast. The pilot ejected and was recovered safely within an hour of the crash and transported to a local medical facility for an assessment. The jet went down in the ocean.\nThe two previous incidents occurred May 6 and Dec. 11 last year. No personnel have been injured in any of the crashes.\nIn December, an F-16 from Kunsan Air Base was flying over the Yellow Sea , which borders the west side of the Korean Peninsula, when it suffered an in-flight emergency. The pilot ejected safely. The investigation of that incident is in its “final stages,” Iverson said in his statement.\nLast May, a routine daytime training sortie went sour when something went wrong and the pilot ejected near Osan Air Base, about 80 miles north of Kunsan. The fighter made a fiery impact in a local field, which was captured by local cameras. Iverson said the incident has been investigated, but results have not been released. Air Force Accident Investigation Board reports are typically published. South Korean broadcaster SBS News obtained footage purportedly showing the moment a U.S. Air Force F-16 crashed near Osan Air Base. Screenshot\nAfter the latest incident, the 7th Air Force paused flying operations to focus on search and recovery operations. Iverson said “some” flying ops began again Feb. 1, though he did not specify which.\n“I also want to acknowledge that this is the third F-16 crash on the peninsula in the last nine months. Thus far, including the preliminary findings from yesterday’s mishap, there are no indications these incidents are related,” he said.\nFrom 2010 to 2021— the latest year for which the Air Force Safety Center has published statistics —33 F-16s have been destroyed in mishaps, or 2.75 per year. Six fighters each were destroyed in 2013 and 2015. Air",
