    "text": "Photo from Unsplash Originally Posted On: https://store.adventinteractive.com/blog/the-evolving-environmental-benefits-of-opting-for-a-preowned-phone-or-laptop.html\n“A small step for you, a giant leap for environmental conservation. Every refurbished device is a powerful choice for a greener tomorrow.”\nMany people tend to buy brand-new gadgets, but there’s a significant shift toward choosing pre-owned phones or laptops. These are previously owned devices that have been carefully checked, fixed, and restored to a condition that’s almost as good as new. Opting for a refurbished laptop or phone not only helps your wallet but also benefits the environment. The United Nations notes that electronics contribute to around 50 million tons of e-waste yearly. Reusing electronics by refurbishment cuts down on e-waste and saves natural resources. The UN report highlights that refurbishing a million smartphones can conserve 16,000 tons of materials such as gold, silver, and rare earth elements. Moreover, using a refurbished smartphone can lower greenhouse gas emissions by about 45 kg CO2 compared to producing a new one. Similarly, the European Union’s research indicates that refurbished laptops are less taxing on the environment than new ones, potentially reducing negative environmental effects by 60%.\nThe Environmental Impact of Electronics: Comparing New and Refurbished This opening discussion aims to dissect the environmental impact of both new and refurbished laptops and phones, casting light on a critical yet often overlooked aspect of our modern tech-driven world.\nNew Electronics and the Environment New electronic gadgets necessitate significant use of precious resources—metals, plastics—and energy-consuming manufacturing that increases carbon emissions. Additionally, electronic waste poses a critical environmental issue, as the ejection of toxic substances can contaminate soil and water, posing risks to ecology and human health.\nRefurbished Electronics: A Greener Alternative Refurbished phones, laptops, or other electronics are a more sustainable option; they demand less resource extraction, energy, and waste production. These devices often consist of components from non-functioning or returned units, thereby not only consuming fewer resources but also reducing their environmental footprint.\nExtended Use Reduces Environmental Strain Keeping electronics operating longer through refurbishment diverts them from landfills, which struggle with decomposition, curbing demand for new products and diminishing the environmental toll.\nCarbon Emissions and Refurbished Laptops or Phones: While new device production generates substantial greenhouse gases—for instance, manufacturing a smartphone leads to around 85 kg of CO2 emissions—refurbishing lowers this figure, enhancing the ecological friendliness of electronic devices.\nEnergy Savings with Refurbished Tech Creating new tech products is energy-intensive. Refurbishing, however, is markedly less so; for example, renewing a laptop can use 50 times less energy than manufacturing a new one, largely because refurbishing bypasses the resource-heavy steps of mining and transportation.\nTackling the E-Waste Challenge Over 50 million tons of electronic waste are produced yearly, with many disposed of improperly. Refurbishing and reusing devices help cut down this number, with the potential to shrink both the carbon footprint and e-waste by 30% if a smartphone’s life is just one year longer.\nConserving Material Resources The drive for new devices exhausts scarce elements like rare earth metals. Through refurbishment, the necessity for virgin materials plummets, relieving the pressure on these finite resources.\nMoreover, purchasing a pre-owned laptop or phone means you will not receive it with the original packaging, eliminating the need to dispose of any such materials. Packaging waste is a significant environmental issue, as the plastics and Styrofoam that safeguard new electronics can linger in landfills for centuries, often causing pollution long before they degrade. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that 54 million metric tons of electronic waste were produced in 2019, yet only a fraction, two million tons, was recycled. That figure has risen to approximately 59.4 million metric tons by 2022. By opting for used phones, not only is the demand for new phone packaging reduced, but also the amount of waste that contributes to the growing problem of e-waste in our landfills.\nMoreover, many pre-owned phones now come unlocked, providing versatility and ease for the consumer. Unlocked phones can be used with various carriers, allowing users to select or switch plans at their convenience. This not only adds a level of freedom for the consumer but also underscores the environmental benefits.\nEconomic Upsides of Refurbished Tech Cheaper than their new counterparts, refurbished phones or laptops offer an economic advantage as well as environmental, making sustainable choices accessible to more people and lessening the impact of electronic production on the planet.\nRefurbished Phones or Laptop Reduces Transportation Pollution Purchasing used phones or laptops can lead to a notable reduction in environmental impact. The transportation of new consumer goods is a major source of pollution, involving substantial fuel consumption by freight vessels and aircraft, along with the use of extensive packaging materials required for safe transit. Opting for used phones diminishes the need for such distribution chains. Moreover, it also curtails the ecological footprint associated with shipping defective returns, thereby playing a significant role in lessening transport-related pollution.\nWrapping up, in the realm of travel essentials, smartphones, and laptops are significantly important for the contemporary traveler. They maintain connections with friends and family, provide navigation, and entertainment, and enable remote work while traveling. Opting for refurbished pre-owned phones or laptops offers cost savings and environmental benefits — it reduces electronic waste and conserves resources, extending the life of electronics and diminishing the need for new manufacturing and raw material extraction, thereby reducing our environmental impact. The majority of refurbished gadgets present a reduced ecological impact when juxtaposed with their new equivalents. Therefore, opting for used phones or refurbished laptop deals in our daily lives allows for substantial environmental benefits, mitigating landfill waste and resource consumption.",

    "text": "Fifth seed and former champion Gerwyn Price was dumped out of the World Darts Championship after a 4-2 defeat to Northern Irishman Brendan Dolan.\nDolan held his nerve to close out the match with his first shot at tops after Price had clawed his way back from two legs down to level in the sixth set.\nIt was a crushing defeat for Welshman Price, who had been intent on repeating his victory in the behind-closed-doors tournament in 2021.\nDolan, who got through his second-round match via a sudden death leg against his compatriot Mickey Mansell, had served an early warning when he took out the opening set with a 144 checkout.\nHis crisp finishing proved the difference as he nudged in front again at 2-1 on the bull, and 64 to repel Price’s advances to go 3-2 up and one set from victory.\nDolan looked set to be made to pay for missing a match-dart at bull at 2-0 in the sixth when Price hit back to break his throw, but the 50-year-old form Enniskillen saw it home in style.\nDolan told Sky Sports: “I was thinking we might go to a last leg but thank god it didn’t because I don’t know if I would have held myself together.”\nBrendan Dolan celebrated one of the biggest wins of his career (Getty Images)\nAnother of the favourites for the title, Luke Humphries came perilously close to joining Price in an early exit but somehow came from 3-1 down to edge past Ricardo Pietreczko 4-3.\nHumphries has been cleaning up at the big events this season to become bookies’ favourite to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy at Alexandra Palace but showed little of that form as, after winning the opening set, he watched his German opponent win nine of the next 12 legs to move just a set away from victory.\nWhen the Englishman was then broken at the start of the fifth set, the game looked to be up, especially as he was seemingly badly affected by a vociferous pro-Pietreczko crowd – many of whom travelled over from Germany – constantly whistling and jeering him.\nBut he dug deep to break straight back, edged the deciding leg in that set to narrow the gap to 3-2 and then won six of the next seven legs to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat before eschewing his normally mild-mannered approach to exuberantly celebrate in front of those who had been supporting his opponent.\nHumphries will now face Joe Cullen in the last 16 and if he does go on to lift the title, may well look back at this narrow escape as the turning point in his championship.\nChris Dobey overcame a scare from Ross Smith to win 4-2 in the highlight of the afternoon session.\nA back-and-forth contest that saw 27 maximums posted throughout saw Dobey march into a 2-0 lead before being pegged back by Smith.\nAnother tight set saw Dobey edge ahead and he hit double 16 for the match to set up a meeting with reigning world champion Michael Smith in the last 16.\nStephen Bunting set up a last-16 clash with Michael van Gerwen after a stunning 4-0 win over Florian Hempel.\nBunting, the former BDO champion, nudged the opener 3-2 and from there the momentum was firmly with him as he swept Hempel away with a whitewash, averaging 101.15 throughout.\nAnother close contest saw Joe Cullen reach the next round with a 4-2 win over Ryan Searle.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

Dozens of News 8 viewers shared photos of the northern lights. Check out some of them in the gallery above. What are the northern lights? The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are a captivating phenomenon characterized by colorful dancing waves of light in the sky. When there is a strong enough geomagnetic storm, the aurora can be seen in Pennsylvania. During these storms, charged particles collide with gases in the earth's upper atmosphere, producing the spectacle. The stronger the geomagnetic storm or larger the amount of material ejected by the sun, the farther south the northern lights can be seen during a storm.
