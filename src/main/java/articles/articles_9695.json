    "text": "How PM Modi and others helped thwart potential Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine in late 2022: Report The United States enlisted the help of the international community as it “prepared rigorously” to avert a potential nuclear strike by Russia on Ukraine after Moscow intensified its offensive on Kyiv in 2022, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials. As the US feared that Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon on Ukraine, outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries played a significant role in thwarting the crisis in the later part of that year, the report said. The Biden administration reached the shocking conclusion about a potential nuclear strike by Russia based on not one but multiple developments, analysis, and – crucially - highly sensitive new intelligence, the report said. “Our assessment had been for some time that one of the scenarios in which they would contemplate using nuclear weapons [included] things like existential threats to the Russian state, direct threats to Russian territory,” one of the senior administration officials quoted by CNN said. Multiple senior administration officials took part in an urgent outreach. “One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” another senior administration official was quoted as saying by CNN. US officials say that outreach and public statements from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis. “I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,” CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying. “I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the senior administration official added. “I can’t demonstrate this positively, but I think that’s our assessment.” In the context of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, India has consistently denounced the killing of civilians and advocated for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that “this is not the era of war” on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement was even placed prominently in the G20 communique under the presidency of India. During this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place “in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it, or deter it,” one of the senior administration officials said. Parallelly, Russia was allegedly spreading a fresh \"false flag narrative\" regarding a Ukrainian “dirty bomb”, a development that US officials were concerned might serve as a pretext for a Russian nuclear assault. In October 2022, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was “concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.” However, it is important to note that according to CNN, the US never detected intelligence indicating that Russia was preparing to deploy its nuclear forces to execute such an attack. “We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.” Support Our Journalism We cannot do without you.. your contribution supports unbiased journalism IBNS is not driven by any ism- not wokeism, not racism, not skewed secularism, not hyper right-wing or left liberal ideals, nor by any hardline religious beliefs or hyper nationalism.

    "text": "Israel: We Are Preparing For War With Lebanon - If Necessary\n[World](articles/category/30/World)| December 28, 2023, Thursday // 10:22\nThe Israeli army is increasingly preparing for a decisive expansion of combat operations against the Shiite movement \"Hezbollah\" in Lebanon, DPA reported.\n\"Today we approved a set of plans for the future, we must be ready for an offensive if necessary,\" Israeli Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi said yesterday during a visit to the military command in the northern Israeli city of Safed.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"and in particular their Northern Command have been put on very high alert,\" he added.\nThe Israeli army has been fighting incessantly with Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon since militants from the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas attacked southern Israel's border areas from Gaza on October 7.\nYesterday, units of the Lebanese Shiite movement fired rockets at the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona; According to Israeli police, material damage was done to several buildings. No one was injured.\nAt the beginning of the war in Gaza, for security reasons, the authorities moved tens of thousands of residents of the northern region to the interior of Israel.\nYesterday, three people, including a Hezbollah fighter, were killed in Israeli attacks against positions of the Shiite movement in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese news agency NNA reported.\nThe fighting in this theater of war, which broke out in early October, represents the sharpest armed confrontation since the Second Lebanon War in 2006, DPA noted.\nBut according to observers, they still continue to be conducted within the boundaries of certain unspoken rules. Both sides have so far avoided a more serious escalation of tensions.\nThe Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement virtually controls the government in Lebanon and has a missile arsenal that poses a threat to Israel.\nIn turn, the Jewish state is capable of inflicting enormous damage on Lebanon militarily.\nIn the Gaza Strip\nIsrael is expanding its operation against the Palestinian group \"Hamas\" in the central part of the Gaza Strip. Against the background of warnings from the United Nations about numerous victims and a severe humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.\nThe Palestinian side has reported over 21,100 dead since the start of the Israeli operation in Gaza. It began in response to the terrorist attacks on October 7 with 1,200 casualties. Ground operations are carried over to the refugee camps in the central part of the enclave. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the north in Gaza City and in the south in the second largest city of Khan Younis. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said an unheard-of crime was being committed against Palestinians and warned that the situation in the West Bank was explosive and Gaza was \"unrecognizable\". According to the Hamas-led Ministry of Health, 195 people have died on the Palestinian side in the last 24 hours.\nIn a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated the need to achieve a lasting ceasefire in Gaza \"with the help of all regional and international partners\".\nWe need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

    "text": "El apoyo de Estados Unidos al derecho a Israel a defenderse sigue siendo “férreo”, afirmó este jueves la Casa Blanca, tras una conversación telefónica sostenida entre el mandatario estadounidense, Joe Biden, y el el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu. “Nuestro apoyo a la autodefensa de Israel sigue siendo férreo”, dijo a los periodistas el portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, John Kirby. “Se enfrentan a una serie de amenazas y Estados Unidos no va a renunciar”, agregó. Aunque la llamada telefónica entre el presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden, y el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, se produjo en un contexto de “creciente frustración” de Washington con su aliado, informó la Casa Blanca. Publicidad Durante la conversación telefónica hoy con Netanyahu, Biden le manifestó que “un alto el fuego inmediato es esencial para estabilizar y mejorar la situación humanitaria y proteger a civiles inocentes”, indicó el secretario de Estado norteamericano, Anthony Blinken, en una rueda de prensa en Bruselas, tras haber participado en una reunión ministerial de la OTAN. Retorno de rehenes También le instó a que permita a sus negociadores concluir “un acuerdo sin dilación para devolver a casa a los rehenes” secuestrados por el movimiento islamista palestino Hamás tras su ataque a Israel el pasado 7 de octubre, en el que también murieron unas 1.200 personas. Biden avisó este jueves a Netanyahu de que el futuro apoyo de Estados Unidos dependerá de las acciones “concretas” que tome para minimizar el daño a civiles en la Franja de Gaza y garantizar la seguridad de los trabajadores humanitarios. Publicidad Ambos mandatarios conversaron por teléfono en lo que supone su primer contacto directo desde el [ataque que el 1 de abril acabó con la vida de siete cooperantes de World Central Kitchen (WCK), la ONG fundada por el chef español José Andrés.](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/internacional/siete-trabajadores-humanitarios-murieron-en-gaza-por-bombardeo-israeli-nota/) “Los resultados sobre el terreno son lamentablemente insuficientes e inaceptables”, aseguró Blinken, que se refirió a que el 100 % de la población de Gaza sufre inseguridad alimentaria y necesita ayuda humanitaria. Publicidad “Dejó clara la necesidad de que Israel anuncie una serie de medidas específicas, concretas y cuantificables para abordar los daños a civiles, el sufrimiento humanitario y la seguridad de los trabajadores humanitarios”, indicó, ya que “la política de Estados Unidos con respecto a Gaza vendrá determinada por nuestra evaluación de la actuación inmediata de Israel en relación con estas medidas”. “Si no vemos los cambios que tenemos que ver, habrá cambios en nuestra política”, insistió.
