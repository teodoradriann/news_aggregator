La vendedora Nilda Vera también fue afectada por una bala perdida.\nEsta mañana de miércoles 9 de abril, en el distrito de El Porvenir, en Trujillo, un ingeniero que trabajaba para la Municipalidad Distrital, fue víctima de un ataque armado mientras cumplía con sus labores en la vía pública.\nEl herido fue identificado como Pedro Castillo Reymundo, ingeniero civil, supervisor de obras y técnico inspector de la Gerencia de Desarrollo Urbano del municipio, el cual se encontraba verificando los avances en la construcción de pistas y veredas a cargo del Consorcio AB, en los exteriores del colegio Pasitos del Futuro. El ataque ocurrió a plena luz del día y frente a varios testigos, entre ellos escolares.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Sin luz en Trujillo y La Libertad este 8 de abril: distritos y horarios del corte, según Hidrandina]\nDe acuerdo con versiones recogidas en el lugar, un sujeto armado se acercó a Castillo y le disparó a quemarropa sin mediar palabra.

Ambos fueron auxiliados por vecinos y trasladados de inmediato al hospital Belén y al hospital Lazarte, donde permanecen bajo observación médica. El estado de salud de ambos es reservado.\nFuentes policiales indicaron que, por la modalidad del atentado, se presume que el ataque fue perpetrado por presuntos extorsionadores, que operarían en la zona exigiendo pagos ilegales a empresas contratistas y funcionarios vinculados a obras públicas.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Estas universidades no dictarán clases presenciales por el paro de transportistas del 10 de abril]\nPersonal de la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) realizó las investigaciones correspondientes, revisando cámaras de seguridad del sector y tomando declaraciones a testigos.

    "title": "Stellantis Offering Employees Up to $72,000 to Quit",
    "text": "Business\nStellantis Offering Employees Up to $72,000 to Quit\nFacing economic uncertainty, Stellantis is offering voluntary buyouts to UAW workers at over 20 facilities.\nStellantis is offering voluntary buyouts to hourly United Auto Workers (UAW) employees at more than 20 facilities in Detroit and Toledo, with payouts reaching up to $72,000, The Detroit Free Press Reported. The move comes as the company aims to improve efficiency amid ongoing market uncertainty, namely a slew of tariffs from the Trump administration set to hammer U.S. automakers.\nWho is eligible?\nThe buyout offer applies to employees at major Stellantis plants, including the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant, Warren Truck, Detroit Assembly Complex, and Toledo Assembly Complex, among others. To qualify, employees must have at least one year of service.\nHow much is Stellantis offering?\nThe buyout packages vary based on seniority. Employees with 1-15 years of service at the company can receive a $50,000 payment. At the top range, employees with 25 years or more of experience can receive a $72,000 payment.\nAdditionally, workers who accept the offer will receive six months of medical benefits, excluding dental coverage. However, management retains the right to decide who can accept the buyout, and some employees may be required to remain on the job until September 30.\nWhy is Stellantis offering buyouts?\nThe automotive giant, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat, has faced financial difficulties in recent years. In 2024, Stellantis experienced declining sales and high inventory levels, forcing it to adjust vehicle pricing and increase marketing efforts. These buyouts follow multiple rounds of job cuts last year that drew criticism from the UAW.\n\"Stellantis continues to review its operations to improve efficiency and protect its competitiveness in a very dynamic market,\" Stellantis spokeswoman Ann Marie Fortunate said in a statement. \"To help in that effort, the company announced that it is offering voluntary termination of employment and retirement incentive packages to represented production employees at its manufacturing and Mopar facilities in Detroit and Toledo as well as production, skilled and salaried bargaining unit employees at its facilities in Illinois.\"\nThe union's response\nUAW Stellantis Department Director Kevin Gotinsky blamed the need for buyouts on \"the mess left behind\" by former CEO Carlos Tavares, who stepped down in 2024. He emphasized that the union worked hard to secure options for workers, including retirement incentives and voluntary terminations.\n\"We negotiated a package with the company's new leadership team that gives workers as many options as possible,\" Gotinsky said. \"For those ready to retire, there's a clear path. For others, voluntary termination is now on the table.\"\nFinal thoughts\nWhile the buyout program is open until May 8, it remains unclear how many employees the company is looking to cut. With looming trade tariffs and economic uncertainty, Stellantis - like many other automakers - is navigating a challenging landscape.\nFor workers considering the offer, the decision will depend on individual circumstances, but with uncertainty in the auto industry, Stellantis' latest move signals a company preparing for potentially tougher times ahead.\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.

    "text": "Notée 2 sur 5, c'est l'une des pires comédies des années 2000 et elle a mis fin à la carrière de Gene Hackman\n© UFD\nC'est un des acteurs les plus mythiques d'Hollywood ! Depuis 20 ans, Gene Hackman coule des jours paisibles loin des projecteurs. Ce dernier a malheureusement tiré sa révérence sur un dernier film... très décevant. Retour sur cet échec cuisant.\nGene Hackman, qui fête ses 95 ans le 30 janvier, est un des acteurs américains les plus adulés. Ce dernier possède une carrière phénoménale, forte d'une centaine de films. Le comédien a par ailleurs récompensé par deux fois aux Oscars.\nUne légende d'Hollywood\nEn 1972, il remporte la statuette de Meilleur acteur pour sa performance dans French Connection. 21 ans plus tard, il gagne celle du Meilleur second rôle pour son rôle mémorable de méchant dans le western Impitoyable de Clint Eastwood.\nAprès une carrière bien remplie, Gene Hackman a pris sa retraite en 2004, après un dernier film... pas vraiment à la hauteur de sa renommée. À l'instar de Sean Connery, qui a terminé sur La Ligue des Gentlemen extraordinaires, long-métrage peu reluisant noté 2,3 sur 5 sur AlloCiné, Gene Hackman a tiré sa révérence sur une oeuvre décevante.\nAvec le score de 2 sur 5, Bienvenue à Mooseport est le dernier film dans lequel a joué Gene Hackman avant de se retirer définitivement des plateaux de tournage. Le long-métrage se distingue par une intrigue qui résonne étonnamment avec l'actualité. Hackman interprète Monroe Cole, un ancien président des États-Unis souhaitant passer le reste de ses jours dans la ville de Mooseport, dans le Maine.\nMais Cole ne cherche pas seulement à échapper aux pressions du gouvernement, il veut aussi échapper à son ex-femme Charlotte (Christine Baranski). Une opportunité se présente lorsque les habitants de Mooseport lui demandent de se présenter à la mairie, ce qu'il fait en apprenant qu'il peut transformer sa maison en bureau, le mettant à l'abri de Charlotte.\nCependant, Cole doit faire face à un concurrence improbable : Harold Harrison (Ray Romano), surnommé \"Handy\" en raison des petits boulots qu'il effectue en ville. Handy est aux antipodes de Cole car il se présente pour reconquérir sa petite amie Sally (Maura Tierney).\nLes raisons d'un échec\nSelon Collider, si l'intrigue de Bienvenue à Mooseport ne fonctionne pas, c'est en raison de la trahison de sa proposition initiale. Le pitch laisse penser à une confrontation entre deux visions portées par Hackman et Romano, ce qui aurait pu aboutir à une satire politique pertinente. Au lieu de cela, le film bascule vite dans la comédie romantique sans grande saveur.\n\"L'intrigue trahit le problème fondamental de Bienvenue à Mooseport. Plutôt qu'une satire politique, les spectateurs ont eu droit à une comédie romantique à peine voilée. Cela devient flagrant lorsque Cole fait appel à son équipe politique, dont son ancienne responsable de la sécurité, Grace Sutherland (Marcia Gay Harden), pour avoir une longueur d'avance sur Handy\", explique Collier Jennings de Collider.\n\"Des étincelles commencent à jaillir entre Grace et Cole, pour finalement aboutir à un moment où les deux protagonistes font leur demande en mariage à leurs amoureuses. C'est dommage, car l'idée d'une confrontation entre un homme de la rue et un politicien sans scrupules aurait pu faire l'objet d'une satire en 2004\", regrette le média américain.\nÀ l'époque, la critique a détruit le film, déplorant le fait que Gene Hackman se soit retrouvé à jouer dans une oeuvre aussi médiocre. Résultat : Bienvenue à Mooseport a été un échec cuisant, engrangeant seulement 14 petits millions de dollars à l'international pour un budget de 30 millions !\nUne production chaotique\nCollider apporte une explication à ce fiasco en évoquant les coulisses de la production. \"Alors que le scénario est l'œuvre de Tom Schulman, auteur du Cercle des poètes disparus, l'histoire est signée Doug Richardson, un scénariste dont le principal titre de gloire est d'avoir travaillé sur des scénarios pleins d'action comme 58 minutes pour vivre et Bad Boys.\"\n\"Comme si cela ne suffisait pas, le réalisateur Donald Petrie était surtout connu pour ses comédies romantiques, notamment Miss Détective et Comment se faire larguer en 10 leçons, ce qui explique peut-être pourquoi Bienvenue à Mooseport s'oriente si largement vers la comédie romantique\", souligne Collider.\nLe média indique ensuite que Gene Hackman n'était pas censé jouer dans le film pour raisons de santé. \"À l'origine, Bienvenue à Mooseport devait être réalisé par Rod Lurie (Manipulations) et mettre en scène Dustin Hoffman dans le rôle de Monroe Cole. Des conflits d'emploi du temps ont finalement conduit Lurie et Hoffman à quitter le projet, Hackman et Petrie embarquant peu après.\"\n\"La goutte d'eau qui a fait déborder le vase est en fait un test d'effort que j'ai passé à New York. Le médecin m'a dit que mon cœur n'était pas en état de subir un quelconque stress\", avait confié Gene Hackman, cité par Collider. \"Il serait facile d'attribuer la retraite de Hackman à la piètre performance dans le film, mais la raison est en fait liée à sa santé\", a conclu le média.\nEn effet, après cet ultime long-métrage, Gene Hackman s'est définitivement retiré des plateaux à l'âge de 74 ans. Depuis, la légende d'Hollywood coule des jours paisibles, loin des projecteurs, se consacrant à la littérature et l'écriture. Il a notamment publié plusieurs romans, explorant son côté créatif.\npublié le 30 janvier, Vincent Formica, Allociné",

    "title": "O futuro da energia solar: como a tecnologia transforma a manutenção de parques solares",
    "text": "Gabriel PavãoDivulgação\nA energia solar tem ganhado cada vez mais espaço nas discussões sobre sustentabilidade e inovação tecnológica. Para se ter uma ideia, o Brasil é considerado um dos países com maior viabilidade dessa matriz energética, tendo em vista que seus níveis de incidência solar são superiores aos de nações que estão acima no ranking de capacidade instalada de geração solar fotovoltaica, como Índia, Alemanha e Japão, segundo dados da Irena (Agência Internacional de Energias Renováveis). Ainda assim, de acordo com a Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), a energia solar representa apenas 18,7% de toda a matriz elétrica brasileira.\nAtualmente, existem 21.224 usinas fotovoltaicas instaladas no Brasil, com outras 2.641.323 de unidades de geração solar, conforme indicam dados da Aneel. Nesse contexto, a manutenção inteligente dos parques solares nacionais destaca-se como essencial para promover a eficiência e a sustentabilidade dessas instalações.\nTendo em vista esse cenário, é válido ressaltar que a tecnologia desempenha um papel decisivo nesse processo, ao integrar a digitalização com práticas de campo para otimizar a operação, garantir uma gestão eficiente dos ativos e maximizar o potencial dessa energia renovável.\nA importância da manutenção de ativos no setor\nA manutenção de ativos é fundamental para garantir a operação eficiente de um parque solar, com enfoque no ciclo de vida das placas solares. Nesse sentido, realizar a manutenção no momento certo é essencial para manter essa eficiência.\nUm exemplo são os inversores de frequência, que podem falhar e comprometer o desempenho do sistema. Além disso, a limpeza regular das placas solares é crucial, já que a sujeira pode reduzir significativamente a captação de luz solar. Desta forma, alinhar esses gatilhos de manutenção é indispensável para assegurar o funcionamento ideal de um parque solar.\nOutro ponto relevante quando se fala sobre manutenção em parques solares, trata-se da confiabilidade dos equipamentos. Dois indicadores essenciais para garantir isto são o MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) e o MTTR (Mean Time to Repair), ou seja, o tempo médio entre falhas e o tempo médio de reparo.\nMonitorar esses KPIs de forma consistente é fundamental, pois ao controlar o tempo de falha e o tempo de reparo, é possível assegurar que o circuito terá menos interrupções e maior continuidade operacional.\nBoas práticas para a manutenção de parques solares\nUma das melhores práticas para a manutenção de parques solares começa com o mapeamento completo de todos os equipamentos. Muitas vezes, após a instalação, detalhes como a localização exata dos dispositivos, a data de compra ou de troca são negligenciados.\nEssas informações são relevantes desde o início da operação de uma planta, ou até mesmo na fase de planejamento do projeto. Desta forma, é preciso que o programa de manutenção seja incluído sempre antes no projeto de construção e instalação. Assim, os especialistas responsáveis pela montagem dos parques solares conseguem integrar o plano de manutenção no escopo do projeto desde o início, garantindo uma gestão mais eficiente ao longo da vida útil do parque.\nOs desafios\nUm dos principais desafios enfrentados pelos parques solares é sua localização, frequentemente em áreas remotas e de difícil acesso, o que torna as inspeções complexas ou até inviáveis. No entanto, já existem no mercado softwares de manutenção que funcionam de forma offline, permitindo que os profissionais salvem os dados coletados no local e, posteriormente, ao se conectarem a uma rede de internet, sincronizem essas informações, solucionando o problema.\nA introdução de drones e termografia também tem revolucionado o setor de energia solar, facilitando a identificação de problemas sem a necessidade de deslocamentos frequentes de técnicos até as áreas remotas.\nEsse avanço tecnológico está promovendo uma mudança no perfil dos profissionais, exigindo novas habilidades e a entrada de técnicos especializados. Não se trata mais apenas do técnico responsável pela manutenção básica e limpeza, mas sim de profissionais capacitados para operar drones, robôs e outros equipamentos específicos.\nA IA no setor solar\nJá existem soluções de Inteligência Artificial (IA) no mercado capazes de prever falhas em equipamentos como inversores de frequência e motores. A aplicação da IA vai além da manutenção de equipamentos, abrangendo também a identificação do posicionamento ideal das placas solares, com base em cálculos de onde o sol incidirá de forma mais eficiente.\nAlém disso, a IA pode prever condições ambientais, como tempestades ou períodos de sol intenso, influenciando diretamente o desempenho de um parque solar. Desta forma, a tecnologia permite que as placas sejam controladas remotamente, ajustando-se conforme as condições climáticas. Essa inovação não só aumenta a eficiência operacional, como também melhora a previsibilidade e a mitigação de riscos climáticos, sendo uma tendência que continuará a evoluir nos próximos anos.\nInvestir em tecnologia é o caminho\nÉ fundamental enfatizar a importância da manutenção nos parques solares para garantir que a operação funcione a 100% da capacidade e com o menor custo. Nesse sentido, investir em manutenção ou implementar um software de gestão de ativos não deve ser visto como uma despesa, mas sim como um investimento de longo prazo.\nAlém disso, é importante que o setor comece a levar em consideração fatores de impacto ambiental, como a reciclagem de equipamentos desgastados, tendo em vista que, em alguns anos, haverá placas solares que se tornarão obsoletas.\nEsse controle eficiente dos ativos, facilitado por um software de gestão da manutenção, também ajuda a monitorar o ciclo de vida do equipamento, desde a compra até o descarte, promovendo uma abordagem mais sustentável e economicamente viável para o futuro.\nGabriel Pavão é Co-founder e Head of Partnerships da Fracttal Brasil",

    "text": "Las Vegas man gets free HVAC system after no air conditioning for a year LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - As Southern Nevada once again braces for triple digit temperatures, it is crucial to remain indoors and stay in air conditioning. However, many people in the Las Vegas Valley are without that necessity. On Friday, an organization called Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada stepped up gave a local man a new HVAC system. “No money no honey,” is the motto 74-year-old Ben tells FOX5 he lives by. However, things are about to get a little sweeter and cooler for him. “It is very hot very terrible,” he said. “Afternoon it is like a oven inside.” Ben has been without air conditioning for a year and tells FOX5 he takes up to three showers a day just to stay cool inside his mobile home. “Not having air for over a year is something I couldn’t even fathom,” Danny Hundly with Bull Dog Air Conditioning and Heating said. “The furnace in this home is from the 70s.” Hundly and Bob Cleveland with Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada stepped in to help Ben. “We came out and qualified him as being low income and we are able to replace his air conditioner at no cost,” Cleveland said. Cleveland said Ben was just one of many in Southern Nevada waiting for some relief. “It’s desperate, we have a waiting list in every one of the municipality,” Cleveland said. Cleveland tells FOX5 he believes there are many who don’t know about his organization. But with the help of his neighbor, Ben was able to trust that the organization was legitimate. Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada said they started off helping 200 people a year, but this year they have helped 1,000 residents and expect that number to grow. To qualify for help from them you must be either low income, a home owner, a veteran, disabled, or a senior. You could learn more [ here](https://rtsnv.org/). Copyright 2024 KVVU.

    "title": "La contundente crítica de un referente de Red Bull a Daniele Ricciardo, tras su salida de la Fórmula 1 - Infobae",
    "text": "Daniel Ricciardo será reemplazado en Racing Bulls por Liam Lawson (Reuters/Christian Bruna) Daniel Ricciardo ya no correrá en la Fórmula 1 y fue reemplazado en el equipo Racing Bulls por el piloto de reserva Liam Lawson para el resto de la temporada 2024. El neozelandés se unirá a Yuki Tsunoda a partir del Gran Premio de Estados Unidos en Austin. Esta decisión marca prácticamente el final de una etapa de 14 años en la Máxima para el australiano, de 35 años, cuyo futuro se sumergió en la incertidumbre.\nHelmut Marko , asesor de Red Bull , comentó que Ricciardo perdió su “ instinto asesino ” durante los años que estuvo alejado del equipo. Los testimonios del ex piloto fueron con Motorsport y explicó que la campaña de Ricciardo nunca se recuperó desde que dejó Red Bull en 2018 , y que su decisión de unirse a Renault fue un punto de inflexión. “En aquel entonces no tenía un coche ganador ni en Renault ni en McLaren. Ganó en Monza, pero esas fueron circunstancias especiales ”, dijo Marko, sobre la competencia en la que que el oceánico se impuso en Italia en 2021 tras el choque de Max Verstappen y Lewis Hamilton.\nRicciardo , quien comenzó en el programa de desarrollo llamado Red Bull Junior, ascendió para competir en el equipo principal entre 2014 y 2018, se destacó en esa era con siete victorias junto a Sebastian Vettel , y luego con un Max Verstappen en rápido ascenso. Sin embargo, su paso a Renault en 2019, convencido por el jefe del equipo Cyril Abiteboul , no resultó en los éxitos esperados debido a la falta de competitividad del coche.\nDespués de dos temporadas sin resultados significativos en Renault , Ricciardo se trasladó a McLaren . A pesar de conseguir una octava victoria en la mencionada carrera italiana en Monza , enfrentó dos temporadas frustrantes intentando adaptarse al coche del equipo inglés, lo que llevó a su despido un año antes del final de su contrato en 2022.\nDaniel Ricciardo logró ocho victorias y se despidió con un récord de vuelta (REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov) Marko también mencionó que las dudas de Ricciardo sobre el motor Honda de Red Bull y su atención a las promesas de Renault influyeron en su decisión de dejar el equipo. “Tenía ciertas reservas sobre el motor Honda y, al parecer, prestó más atención a las palabras dulces de Renault y Cyril Abiteboul ”, explicó Marko . “ En términos económicos, no había mucha diferencia entre lo que Renault le ofrecía y lo que nosotros le ofrecíamos ”, destacó.\nEn cuanto a la reciente salida de Ricciardo , Marko afirmó que el piloto fue informado sobre lo que sucedería. “ El momento elegido estuvo relacionado con una variedad de factores y obligaciones ”, dijo Marko. “Se le informó y la actuación digna de despedida fue, creo, la vuelta más rápida ”.\n“Llegó a nosotros venciendo a Vettel con tres victorias a cero en 2014 y después de eso, Daniil Kvyat fue más rápido que él a veces, pero a lo largo de la temporada también lo tuvo bajo control”, recordó. “Y luego llegó Max y se hizo cada vez más fuerte, así que esa fue sin duda una de las razones de su decisión de elegir a Renault en lugar de a nosotros”, subrayó.\nMarko concluyó que Ricciardo no logró superar consistentemente a Tsunoda , lo que hizo evidente que su regreso a Red Bull Racing no funcionó como se esperaba. “Creo que quedó claramente comunicado que tiene que ser significativamente mejor que Yuki Tsunoda y sólo lo logró en unas pocas carreras”, sostuvo quien también es pieza clave en el programa Red Bull Junior y siempre aplicó su ojo clínico para seleccionar talentos.\nRicciardo debutó a mediados de la temporada 2011 en el extinto Hispania Racing Team . Disputó 257 Grandes Premios, logró 8 victorias, alcanzó 32 podios, 3 poles positions y 17 récords de vueltas.",
