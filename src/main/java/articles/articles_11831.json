    "text": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren\n 4:00 4:12 am.\nVANCOUVER — British Columbia’s abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb’s trails are open, while Vancouver’s Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver’s three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are “definitely behind the 8-ball” because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n“All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,” Shalman said.\n“This is not something where you can make up what you’re down during Christmas break. You won’t make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.”\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n“I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,” he says. “We’re Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.”\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of “thin snow coverage” for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n“Rain’s the star of the show today,” Cypress Mountain’s update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a “blocking pattern” across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like “a wall.”\nHe said Environment Canada’s long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n“We may see potential for some snowfall,” Proctor says. “But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Kehlkopfkrebs: Zwei zentrale Risikofaktoren, die vermeidbar sind\nMänner erkranken häufiger an Kehlkopfkrebs, wobei zwei bedeutende Risikofaktoren im Fokus stehen. Frühe Warnsignale sollten nicht unterschätzt werden.\nFrankfurt – In Deutschland erkranken jährlich etwa 3.600 Männer und 500 Frauen an Kehlkopfkrebs, auch Larynxkarzinom genannt. Die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft gibt an, dass die Betroffenen im Durchschnitt 68 Jahre alt sind, wobei Männer häufiger betroffen sind als Frauen. Tumore entwickeln sich meist im Bereich der Stimmlippen und können bei frühzeitiger Erkennung oft erfolgreich therapiert werden. Zudem sind die beiden Hauptrisikofaktoren vermeidbar und somit das Risiko, an Kehlkopfkrebs zu erkranken, reduzierbar.\nZwei vermeidbare Risikofaktoren begünstigen die Entwicklung von Kehlkopfkrebs\nTabak- und Alkoholkonsum gelten als die Hauptursachen für Kehlkopfkrebs. Der Tabakkonsum steht in direktem Zusammenhang mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit, an dieser Krankheit zu erkranken, wobei sowohl die Intensität als auch die Dauer des Konsums eine Rolle spielen. Dies berichtet die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft.\nEin weiterer wesentlicher Risikofaktor ist der übermäßige Konsum von Alkohol. Besonders gefährlich wird es, wenn beide Faktoren zusammenkommen. Das Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) weist darauf hin, dass die Kombination aus langjährigem Rauchen und regelmäßigem, starkem Alkoholkonsum besonders schädlich ist.\nKehlkopfkrebs: Weitere Risikofaktoren, die man kennen sollte\nNeben den Hauptursachen gibt es weitere Faktoren, die das Risiko für Kehlkopfkrebs erhöhen können. Berufliche Exposition gegenüber Schadstoffen wie Asbest und schwefelsäurehaltigen Gasen (Aerosolen) zählt dazu, wie netdoktor.de berichtet. Auch bestimmte Virusinfektionen, insbesondere mit humanen Papillomaviren (HPV), können zur Entstehung von Kehlkopfkrebs beitragen, so die Apotheken Umschau.\nKehlkopfkrebs lässt sich jedoch vermeiden. Durch den Verzicht auf Rauchen und die Reduzierung oder den vollständigen Verzicht auf Alkohol können Betroffene ihr persönliches Risiko erheblich senken. Frühe Warnzeichen von Kehlkopfkrebs wie anhaltende Heiserkeit, dauerhaftes Halskratzen, Räusperzwang und chronischer Husten sollten ernst genommen und zeitnah von einem Arzt untersucht werden. Bei rechtzeitiger Diagnose und Behandlung sind die Heilungschancen bei Kehlkopfkrebs deutlich besser als in fortgeschrittenen Stadien.

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Teclast has managed to develop affordable and high-quality tablets, and among these devices the Teclast M50 HD stands out. It can be purchased from Amazon for an affordable price of around $160. The device provides a large storage space of 128 GB and 8 GB of RAM, in addition to a high-resolution screen with full-width resolution and support for streaming high-resolution content thanks to Widevine L1\ntechnology.\nThese devices are characterized by their small size and light weight, which makes them ideal for daily use and transportation. The device also includes a portable modem, allowing the user to access the Internet almost anywhere and make calls.\nThe device is based on the Android 13 system, which allows for a smooth and easy user experience, and Teclast has not installed excessive applications or annoying advertising applications. Despite its low price, the device comes with a metal body that looks elegant with its bright blue color and is considered fairly stable.\nHowever, there are some disadvantages that should be pointed out.

    "text": "“Un duro golpe para el sistema”: los médicos advierten por salida del mercado del inhalador para asma Flovent\nAlexandra Ferguson\n(CNN) — A partir del 1 de enero, un medicamento que ayuda a respirar a miles de pacientes desaparecerá de las farmacias, y a los médicos les preocupa que los pacientes puedan tener problemas para cambiar a otras alternativas y conseguir que el seguro las cubra.\nEl fabricante GSK anunció que dejará de comercializar el inhalador Flovent para el asma y que, en su lugar, fabricará una versión “genérica autorizada”, idéntica pero sin la misma marca.\nLos médicos que tratan a pacientes con asma afirman que el genérico autorizado funcionará igual de bien que el medicamento de marca, pero no parece tener la misma cobertura por parte de las aseguradoras. Eso puede significar que los pacientes tendrán que obtener nuevas recetas y sortear obstáculos de cobertura en plena temporada de virus respiratorios.\n“Este medicamento ha sido el fármaco inhalado más utilizado en los últimos 25 o 30 años”, afirma la Dra. Robyn Cohen, neumóloga pediátrica del Boston Medical Center. “Es el que, en su inmensa mayoría, los pediatras eligen cuando deciden que su paciente necesita una medicación preventiva diaria… El hecho de que se suspenda supondrá un golpe enorme para el sistema, tanto para los pacientes como para las familias y los médicos”.\nLos médicos instan a los pacientes a que tomen medidas ahora para asegurarse de que disponen de su medicación de cara al nuevo año, y los grupos de defensa de los derechos de los pacientes han intentado hacer correr la voz.\nPero la historia de la desaparición de Flovent y la falta de cobertura de su sustituto, aparentemente idéntico, afecta a algunas de las facetas más complejas de la atención sanitaria y los precios de los medicamentos en Estados Unidos.\nCVS cambiará la forma en que fija los precios de los medicamentos recetados en EE.UU. ¿que significa?\nImportante cambio en el programa de medicamentos de Medicaid\nUna portavoz de GSK dijo que la compañía está haciendo el cambio “como parte de nuestro compromiso de ser ambiciosos para los pacientes”.\nSeñaló que la compañía introdujo los genéricos autorizados de Flovent HFA, un aerosol de inhalación, y Flovent Diskus, un polvo de inhalación, en mayo de 2022 y octubre de 2023, y que, posteriormente, dejaría de fabricar las versiones de patente en Estados Unidos el 1 de enero de 2024.\nLos genéricos autorizados, dijo, “proporcionarán a los pacientes en EE.UU. alternativas potencialmente más baratas de estos productos médicamente importantes”.\nSin embargo, los expertos que siguen la industria tanto en Wall Street como en el mundo académico señalan que GSK está haciendo el cambio precisamente en el momento en que un cambio en los reembolsos de Medicaid podría hacer que la empresa tuviera que pagar grandes multas debido a los aumentos de precio de Flovent durante varios años.\nFarmacéuticos advierten que los medicamentos “suben por encima de la inflación”\nEl cambio legal que entrará en vigor el 1 de enero suprime un límite a los reembolsos de Medicaid que las empresas están obligadas a pagar si aumentan el precio de los medicamentos por encima de la inflación.\n“Flovent Diskus lleva en el mercado desde 2000 y Flovent HFA desde 2004, y GSK ha subido el precio de ambos productos en numerosas ocasiones desde su lanzamiento”, declaró a CNN el Dr. William Feldman, médico adjunto de la División de Medicina Pulmonar y Cuidados Críticos del Hospital Brigham and Women’s que estudia los medicamentos para el asma. “Estos son precisamente el tipo de fármacos que se verán afectados por la nueva política que elimina el tope de reembolso de Medicaid”.\nHasta ahora, los reembolsos tenían un tope en el precio total de un medicamento, por lo que los fabricantes nunca pagarían más de lo que cuesta un medicamento de vuelta a Medicaid.\nPero en virtud de una disposición de la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de 2021, ese límite se eliminó, y a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, los medicamentos que han estado sujetos a grandes aumentos de precios a lo largo del tiempo podrían terminar incurriendo en reembolsos a Medicaid que son mayores que su precio, lo que significa que las compañías farmacéuticas venderían esos medicamentos a Medicaid con pérdidas.\n“Obviamente, las farmacéuticas no quieren vender con pérdidas nada de su cartera”, afirma Andrew Baum, analista de GSK y otras farmacéuticas para la firma financiera Citi. “Así que busca evadir el impacto mediante, uno: la discontinuación y dos: el genérico autorizado”.\nUn genérico autorizado, dijo Baum a CNN, es visto como un producto separado, “pero aún permite a la farmacéutica recoger parte de la rentabilidad”.\nO, dicho de otro modo, es el mismo producto sin la marca y también sin el historial de subidas de precio que dejarían al medicamento vulnerable a esos grandes reembolsos a Medicaid.\nSegún datos de GoodRx, el precio de la marca Flovent ha subido alrededor del 47% desde 2014.\nOtros fabricantes de medicamentos también han hecho cambios antes de la eliminación del límite de reembolso del 1 de enero. Los fabricantes de insulina anunciaron este año importantes recortes de precios, del 70% o más, en sus productos, una medida que los analistas estiman que les ahorrará cientos de millones de dólares al año.\nLa estrategia de genéricos autorizados que está empleando GSK “es una forma, en términos generales, de maximizar la rentabilidad del producto en cuestión”, dijo David Amsellem, analista financiero que cubre el sector en la firma de inversión Piper Sandler.\nAmsellem señaló que actualmente no hay otras versiones genéricas de Flovent aprobadas por la FDA.\nPor ejemplo, un envase de Flovent HFA en la dosis de 110 microgramos cuesta US$ 273,83, aproximadamente un 50% más que el costo de adquisición al por mayor de US$ 177,99 de su homólogo genérico autorizado, según los precios que la empresa comunicó a CNN. El costo de adquisición al por mayor es el precio antes de seguros y descuentos.\nPero CVS Caremark, un importante gestor de beneficios farmacéuticos que determina qué medicamentos están cubiertos por el seguro para sus miembros, está dando un lugar preferencial a otro inhalador de marca, Pulmicort, en su formulario, en lugar de las versiones genéricas autorizadas de Flovent.\n“En este caso, los genéricos autorizados eran más caros que los medicamentos de marca”, dijo un portavoz de CVS a CNN. Señaló que se basa en los precios netos, en lugar del costo de adquisición al por mayor, lo que significa que Pulmicort podría ser menos costoso debido a los descuentos que su fabricante, AstraZeneca, paga para obtener una mejor cobertura de seguro.\n“El peor momento del año”\nEl hecho de que los planes de seguro no estén cubriendo ampliamente el genérico autorizado de Flovent, dijo Cohen de BMC, “significa que los pacientes van a tener que obtener una nueva receta para un medicamento completamente diferente en medio de la peor época posible del año, que es la temporada de virus respiratorios de invierno”.\nPara los pacientes con asma persistente, dijo Cohen, Flovent ha sido el medicamento antiinflamatorio preventivo diario más utilizado durante décadas. Contrae la inflamación de las vías respiratorias y reduce la respuesta exagerada del organismo a los desencadenantes que dificultan la respiración.\nA medida que los virus respiratorios se propagan por todas partes, ¿qué debes hacer si te enfermas?\nDurante la temporada de influenza y resfriados, dice, es aún más importante disponer de ese medicamento diario.\n“La influenza, el covid, el virus respiratorio sincitial, todos estos virus que circulan en estos momentos, son uno de los principales desencadenantes, si no el principal, de los ataques de asma en los niños”, explica Cohen. “Esto es lo que hace que los niños lleguen a urgencias”.\nCohen dijo que le preocupa que los pacientes, así como los médicos y farmacéuticos, no sepan sobre este cambio sobre Flovent, y tienen que actuar ahora para encontrar alternativas y determinar la cobertura del seguro.\nVirus respiratorios amenazan a EE.UU.: ¿cómo debemos protegernos?\nPara algunos grupos, las alternativas son más limitadas. Para los pacientes con una enfermedad inflamatoria más rara, llamada esofagitis eosinofílica (EoE), Flovent HFA es uno de los esteroides tópicos más recetados, y otros medicamentos no tienen tantos datos que respalden su uso en la enfermedad, dijo la Dra. Erin Syverson, médica adjunta de la División de Gastroenterología, Hepatología y Nutrición del Hospital Infantil de Boston.\nDado que la EoE afecta al esófago, los pacientes ingieren el medicamento en lugar de respirarlo, y éste puede controlar la inflamación que puede causar dolor al tragar o que la comida se atasque, lo que requiere procedimientos para extraerla. Según Syverson, en los niños la EoE puede provocar vómitos recurrentes, ardor y dolor de estómago, y dificultades para empezar a tomar alimentos sólidos.\n“Me preocupa que la interrupción del tratamiento vaya a suponer un obstáculo más para una población de pacientes que ya dispone de una medicación muy limitada”, declaró Syverson a CNN. “No sé cómo será enero, pero estoy preocupada”.\n— Tami Luhby de CNN contribuyó con este reportaje.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
