    "text": "Next month, a judge will decide if convicted felon Donald Trump should\nreceive time in prison after being found guilty of 34 class E felonies stemming from the hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. And should the ex-president in fact receive time behind bars, there’s at least one person he can ask for tips on how to survive on the inside: longtime adviser Stephen Bannon, who’s got approximately three weeks until his prison sentence begins.\nOn Thursday, a federal judge\nordered Bannon to surrender to authorities by July 1 to begin a four-month prison sentence for defying a subpoena from Congress to testify about January 6. Bannon was actually sentenced all the way back in October 2022 but was allowed to remain free pending appeal; last month, a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court upheld his guilty conviction. Following that ruling, Judge Carl Nichols said the adviser to the ex-president could no longer delay his sentence. Should the full appeals court rule in Bannon’s favor before July, Bannon could avoid time—but barring that, no dice.\nSpeaking to reporters after receiving the news, Bannon said he’ll take his case to the Supreme Court if necessary, and claimed that his prison sentence was about Trump. “This is about shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump,” he said, then added: “There’s nothing that can shut me up.”\nMeanwhile, as the Times notes, this is not the only legal issue on Bannon’s plate:\nA couple of months after he was found guilty of contempt of Congress in Washington, state prosecutors in Manhattan accused him of misusing money he helped raise for a group backing Mr. Trump’s border wall. In his final hours in office in 2021, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon in a separate federal case that focused on similar accusations.\nMr. Bannon’s fraud trial is scheduled to take place later this year in the same Manhattan courthouse where Mr. Trump was recently convicted on charges of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that threatened his 2016 run for the presidency.\nIncidentally, Bannon is not the only Trump ally sentenced to prison for defying a congressional subpoena—former trade adviser Peter Navarro is\ncurrently doing a four-month sentence for the same crime. And if you’re wondering how many members of Team Trump have received prison sentences total, the answer is eight.

Training is scheduled to start in January.\n\"At international level, SL Benfica, through its Board of Directors, and in particular through Benfica International, is creating a constellation of academies. And we are clearly looking to focus on talent. That's what we're focused on, and in coordination with our training department, we've been looking at countries that are strategically important for SL Benfica,\" explains Miguel Reis, the Club's global International Expansion coordinator.\nCarlos Costa, Fábio Alfredo e Ricardo Costa are the Benfica coaches assigned to the project, under the coordination of Pedro Alegria, who led the entire recruitment process and will continue on site to lead and guarantee the implementation of the Benfica methodology at Benfica Campus Côte d'Ivoire.\nAs he tells us in this report, the challenges were many, from the logistics to the players and the “problems” in Africa.\n\"We had a lot of help from our local partner, which was crucial for us to be able to have the success we ended up having,\" says the technical coordinator of Benfica Campus Côte d'Ivoire.\nAt the end of September, a recruitment process began with 31 actions in 31 locations across the country. For more than two months, Benfica's team of coaches toured the entire Ivorian coast and observed around 20,000 young people out of a total of around 30,000 registered.\n\"For us, Benfica, it was important to go to these children, meet them and give them the opportunity to live their dream and to be able to join the Benfica Campus Academy. It was a very extensive operation, with nearly 20,000 athletes to observe, but it was extremely important and vital for the project,\" reveals Davide Gomes, technical coordinator for International Projects.\nPedro Alegria completes: \"We felt that there were often children who didn't come to the trials, especially in the inland areas, because they had to decide between finding money for transportation or finding money to eat.\"\nHaving traveled more than 5,000 kilometers across the country during this period, Benfica was represented by members of the Club's central structure and also present were Lancine Diamondé, CEO Sportify Capital Benfica Campus Côte d'Ivoire, Touré Nambo, Inspector of Sport, representing the Minister of Sport, and Habib Sanogo, Director General of the National Institute of Youth and Sport. A strong local institutional presence, revealing the importance and impact that this project anticipates in the development of local football.\nOnce the selection has been finalized, training is scheduled to begin in January 2025. \"What we have to do now is take the selected players who will be staying at the Benfica Campus Côte d'Ivoire Abidjan Academy. We've got the teams set up, we're going to start working with these players every day, start developing and training them, teaching them what our methodology is with the expectation of what our goal is in youth football, which is to develop and find players who could one day be part of SL Benfica's first team,\" says Davide Gomes.\nFor Pedro Alegria, “it was a nice surprise.” \"It was originally planned to be for young people aged 14 to 20, but we had children as young as 10 wanting to take part. We had a lot of people over the age of 20 wanting to take part, because everyone was meeting their dream of one day being able to represent SL Benfica. The contribution of knowing the Benfica brand and the Benfica methodology was recognized by everyone,\" he sums up, with examples of the selected players.\n\"We played a few games with them and some training sessions. With all the knowledge we brought, we felt that they were really enthusiastic,\" he says.\nFor Miguel Reis, the pride of \"contributing to the legacy of SL Benfica, not only in Portugal but also in the world\" stands out.\n\"I say Portugal, because we're clearly going to bring players into Benfica's first team within the scope of our mission, because that's the mission of Benfica's entire youth system. It's a feeling of legacy, because Benfica expands in the best way it knows how, which is to create talent, and I think that's the mark we're going to leave all over the world.\"\nText: Editorial Staff\nPhotos: SL Benfica\nLast update: Thursday, December 26, 2024\nFábio Veríssimo is the referee for the Sporting-Benfica match\nDiogo Prioste has already received the Liga 2 Midfielder of the Month award for November\nSolidarity Christmas at Estádio da Luz\nChristmas is a time for sharing!\nWith photo gallery\nBenfica Museum and Estádio da Luz hosted night tours",

    "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Two days of training camp has done nothing to quell the angst over the state of the Patriots offensive line, which was one of the top storylines heading in. Earlier in the week, Jerod Mayo indicated the coaching staff was working to fill out the line with “the best five players.” So they’re on a fact-finding mission, even if that means moving people around. “If that means you’ve got to play guard or play tackle, I don’t know,” Mayo said Tuesday. “We’ll see, it’ll play itself out in camp. That’s my mindset, it’s about putting the best players on the field.” Right now, the best looks like Chuks Okorafor at left tackle, Sidy Sow at left guard, David Andrews at center, Michael Onwenu at right guard, and a right tackle to be named later. Based on the first two days, four of the five positions appeared to be locked in, while there’s uncertainty over the fifth spot at right tackle. On Wednesday, Calvin Anderson had the top run at right tackle, next to Michael Onwenu, who was the presumptive starter at the position but has been moved inside. On Thursday, Vederian Lowe was to the right of Onwenu, not Anderson. And what gives with rookie Caedan Wallace, a right tackle the Patriots were convinced could play left tackle, but hasn’t been there, and appears down the depth chart on the right side? Will he get the nod at right tackle on Friday? Translation: Even with four of the positions seemingly set, it’s anyone’s guess how it will shake out. The Patriots spent a lot of money to keep Onwenu in the fold. In March, they re-signed him to a three-year, $57 million deal with $38 million guaranteed. Essentially, they gave him tackle money. So now, he’s a guard? Onwenu, taken in the sixth round of the 2020 NFL Draft, has bounced around a bit during his four seasons. He appeared mostly at right tackle as a rookie, played both tackle positions in 2021, moved to right guard in 2022 and finished the 2023 season as the team’s starting right tackle. That was the greatest position of need, and given the pains the Patriots took to keep him, appeared to have found his niche. “Wherever the team needs me to play, that’s where I’ll be,” Onwenu said Wednesday, while admitting he was a bit surprised to be moved inside. “As the days go on, I’ll keep practicing at whatever position, and we’ll see where I am.” It’s possible the “best five” involves Onwenu playing guard, because they can’t come up with two guards in that circle of five. He’s arguably the Patriots' best offensive lineman, but the problem is they don’t have quality depth at either right guard or right tackle. Okorafor, meanwhile, told reporters Thursday that the merry-go-round is likely to continue. So who knows what it’ll look like when the dust settles? It could all change once the pads come on Monday and it’s a little easier to judge in a full contact practice. “Our coaches have said every day will be a different line. We don’t really know who is going to be the guy yet,” Okorafor said. “Obviously with Dave [Andrews] and Mike [Onwenu] we know about them but I think apart from that, everything is open.” Okorafor has also done an about face about his move to the left side. During the early camps, the former Steeler talked about the difficulty about moving from right tackle to the left. He voiced some uncertainty about the switch. Now, he’s saying he doesn’t know why everyone is making such a big deal about the move. Even Mayo didn’t sound completely certain Okorafor would be the left tackle. “I would say right now, based on the time he’s been in the league alone, he’s going to start there,” Mayo said. “But again, my mentality and our offensive mentality is to put the five best guys out on the field. We’ll see how it plays out.” As for Anderson, he’s back in the mix after seeing his 2023 season derailed by complications from malaria. He signed a three-year deal as a free agent, and with his health restored, is out to prove his worthiness. “I think my expectation is to come out and show everybody what they didn’t get to see last year,” Anderson said. “Obviously with all the setbacks I had, I had to miss a lot of the year, which was really frustrating. So now I’m healthy. I’m big. I’m strong. I want to show them all what I’m capable of doing.” In this game of musical chairs with the offensive line, stay tuned to who’ll be left sitting.",
