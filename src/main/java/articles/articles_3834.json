    "title": "Stanford scientists develop gel to protect homes against wildfires - CBS San Francisco",
    "text": "Stanford University researchers have developed a new solution to fight wildfires and protect homes. They said their new sprayable gel technology can protect homes against wildfires, transforming into a solid air bubble shield of protection.\nChangxin \"Lyla\" Dong is a third-year PhD candidate at Stanford. She has always been passionate about science ever since she was a child. It's that passion that brought her to Stanford.\nStanford fire-resistant gel KPIX Dong remembered her breakthrough first year when her lab made an incredible discovery. She called it, \"serendipity.\"\n \"It's never been reported in any study or paper, and we also discovered it by accident!\" said Dong.\n \"Science doesn't have nearly as many eureka kind of moments as movies would have you believe, but this was definitely one of those eureka moments,\" said Eric Appel, Stanford Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering. \"It was really fun one to see the material change right before your eyes, and then provide such a massive improvement in protection to the treated substrates.\"\nTheir surprise discovery was that when they spread their hydrogel technology onto a piece of wood and then blasted it with fire, their gel actually transformed, bubbling up into this aerogel shell-like layer, completely protecting the wood.\n\"We were able to show that if you take a torch and you put it right on the gel, that the gel poofs up into a silica-like foam and so that was surprising,\" said Appel. \"We really had no idea what to expect.\"\nDong demonstrated and showed how the gel protected the wood.\nShe explained, \"When you see the inside, it's like a big air pocket. It's like a solid air bubble. When you carefully remove it, you can see the wood is intact.\"\n\"I was thinking that this was very new!\" said Dong. \"I've personally seen anything like that!\"\nExisting sprayable gels on the market today can only protect homes against wildfires for 30 seconds at best. The problem is those hydrogels only work when they're wet.\nStanford's new gel technology works by creating a solid foam insulation that can withstand fire for five minutes.\nResearchers said they still need to fully develop the product, conducting pilot burn tests on a larger scale before getting it on the market to homeowners.\n\"As an engineer, the kind of thing I love focusing on are where there are problems without solutions and how can we design better technologies to address those challenges,\" said Appel.\n\"I think it's very rewarding for me to know that I'm already making an impact as a PhD student\" said Dong.\nStanford researchers said their gel technology is environmentally safe. Their research was recently published in the scientific journal Advanced Materials .",

    "title": "La llegada de una DANA a Canarias dejará precipitaciones intensas desde mañana y durante el fin de semana",
    "text": "MADRID, 22 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa llegada de una DANA (depresión aislada en niveles altos) a las islas Canarias dejará precipitaciones intensas desde este viernes y durante todo el fin de semana, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET).\nAsí, la DANA que se ha ido desplazando hacia el sur por el oeste de la Península Ibérica, tenderá a situarse sobre las islas Canarias a partir del viernes, quedando estacionaria en esa posición al menos hasta el domingo, lo que generará inestabilidad atmosférica en el entorno del archipiélago.\nPor ello, es probable que haya chubascos localmente fuertes y acompañados de tormenta a partir del viernes y durante el fin de semana. La AEMET puntualiza que, debido a la incertidumbre que caracteriza este tipo de situaciones, es difícil precisar las zonas más afectadas y la duración del episodio.\nEn cualquier caso, añade que lo más probable es que los chubascos más intensos comiencen el viernes por la tarde, afectando especialmente a las islas orientales, donde podrían ser localmente fuertes, sin descartar que afecten también a medianías orientadas al sureste de Tenerife y Gran Canaria.\nEs probable que el sábado sea el día más adverso, con chubascos generalizados, acompañados de tormenta, que serán más probables, intensos y persistentes en el norte de las islas montañosas. Se espera que vayan extendiéndose de oeste a este durante ese día, sin descartar granizo de forma ocasional y con cotas de nieve en torno a 2.000-2.200 metros.\nAdemás, soplará viento del norte con intervalos fuertes y rachas muy fuertes en las islas de mayor relieve, que afectarán especialmente a medianías orientadas al norte y cumbres de la provincia occidental.\nEl domingo todavía continuará la inestabilidad, aunque es probable que la DANA comience a alejarse de las islas, por lo que se espera que los chubascos sean menos intensos que el día anterior, tendiendo a remitir el lunes.\nNo obstante, la AEMET indica que existe una alta incertidumbre respecto a la posición y la evolución de la DANA, por lo que actualmente no se puede descartar que el episodio pueda extenderse.\nLeer más acerca de: AEMET",

    "title": "King hails Senedd as ‘essential to life of Wales’ as he marks 25th anniversary",
    "text": "The King has celebrated 25 years of Welsh devolution as he addressed the Senedd, saying his “respect and affection for the people of this ancient land” had “deepened with every passing year”. In a speech peppered with Welsh, Charles described the anniversary as a “significant milestone” and spoke of the “great change” that had occurred over the quarter of a century. The King, who was visiting Cardiff with the Queen, told Senedd members that the Welsh Parliament had become essential to the life of Wales. The King is greeted by members of the public outside the Senedd (Chris Jackson/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Chris Jackson) The former Prince of Wales also touched upon his pride in seeing his son, the current Prince of Wales, continue his relationship with the country. Charles, who spent nine weeks at the University of Aberystwyth learning Welsh when he was 20, began by thanking the Llywydd – the Speaker – and First Minister Vaughan Gething and gathered politicians in Welsh. He added: “The Queen and I are so delighted to join you today as we mark this significant milestone in our history – the 25th anniversary of Welsh devolution. Charles and Camilla during their visit to Cardiff (Chris Jackson/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Chris Jackson) “It is a milestone on a journey which it has been my privilege, all my life, to share with you. “During times which have seen great change, profound sorrow, and tremendous achievement. Through it all, my respect and affection for the people of this ancient land have deepened with every passing year.” He added: “Over the last 25 years, the Senedd has become more than a symbol. The King and Queen sitting in the Senedd during the special session (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Ben Birchall) “It has become essential to the life of Wales. “As we look back over the last quarter-century in the long journey of our history, I offer you my heartfelt congratulations – llongyfarchiadau mawr – on all you have achieved.” The King said of heir to the throne William: “It has given me great pleasure to see my son’s relationship with this special land continue, including returning only this week to Anglesey – Ynys Mon – a place which I know means so much to him.” Charles gave the Prince of Wales title to his son the day after acceding to the throne, announcing the decision in his first televised address to the nation. The King meeting members of the community (Chris Jackson/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Chris Jackson) It is the monarch’s first visit to the Welsh Parliament since September 2022, when he received a motion of condolence after the death of the late Queen. Troops from the Royal Welsh formed a guard of honour and the royal party was greeted by children representing schools across Wales. Camilla, who was dressed in an Anna Valentine pale pink coat dress and Lock &amp; Co straw hat, wore a leek brooch in celebration of the country’s national emblem. A member of the Royal Welsh with a goat mascot outside the Senedd in Cardiff (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Ben Birchall) The King affectionately praised Wales as a “unique mosaic of places”. “What a country you have to serve. What a unique mosaic of places, landscapes and cultures is entrusted to your care,” he said. Charles added: “Welsh minds have indeed been directed to Welsh matters, and the distinct voice of Wales is heard with clarity and purpose.” The King and Queen depart after their visit (Chris Jackson/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Chris Jackson) And he praised the Senedd’s use of the Welsh language, saying in Welsh: “It is – if I may say so – very good to see that the Senedd makes so much use of the Welsh language. Not just as a symbol. But as an essential. The best way to show honour is to make use.” The King’s new harpist, Mared Pugh-Evans, gave her first performance in the position during the celebration. Camilla was presented with a posy by 10-year-old Celyn Matthews-Williams, a Covid community champion from Llanelli, South Wales. Camilla receives a bouquet of flowers (Chris Jackson/PA) (PA Wire/PA Images - Chris Jackson) During the pandemic, the youngster raised money for food banks and the Wales Air Ambulance and brought joy to her community by growing sunflowers and setting up a book exchange on her garden wall. The visit coincides with a new law which will see the size of the Senedd increase to 96 members from 2026.",
