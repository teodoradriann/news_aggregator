    "title": "A Lament for the Church of England: Crying Female Bishops and the Ecclesial Harm of Feminism",
    "text": "At a recent Anglican Synod, the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullaly, broke down in tears.\nWhy was the Bishop of London moved to tears? Was it because of the utter lack of faith in so many modern churches? Was it because of the catastrophic decline of the Church of England in our time? Or was it due to the hundreds of thousands of aborted babies every year in the very nation to which that Church is called? None of the above. She was moved to tears because of “micro-aggressions” and “institutional barriers” against women within the Church of England.\n“I would love to encourage women,” she said , “which I do all the time. But there continues to be institutional barriers. We continue to experience micro-aggression…” It was at that point that she broke down in tears, after which she was lavishly applauded by the well-groomed crowd.\nIt’s difficult to describe just what those culturally Marxist terms of the Zeitgeist communicate at such a time as this. This is, after all, a time in which women are “permitted” to teach and exercise authority over men in the church as preachers, vicars, and even as bishops, with many even calling for a first female archbishop .\nNever in the history of its existence has the Church of England been more influenced by the rule of women, and never in the history of its existence has the Church of England been more at risk of collapse. Yet it is the apparent ongoing raft of subjective “micro-aggressions” against women deemed to be the greatest cause of ecclesial harm.\nI wonder, then, whether the bishop might class it as a “macro-aggression” if I suggested that her very response—whether a symptom of her own ideological delusion or a subtler form of emotional sabotage —shows why we need not fewer institutional barriers against women in the Church, but more?\nThe Problem with Feminist “Progress” We might start with the very barrier Mullaly so rudely stepped over in order to become a bishop in the first place, continuing the pattern of Anglican apostasy which seeks to justify their fundamental embarrassment of the Bible’s representation of women to the feminists of this world, whom they have so desperately sought to impress for so long.\nRead it all in That Good Fight",

    "text": "4 Lies the Enemy Uses against Us from Genesis\nShare\n“Human history is the long, terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.” - C.S. Lewis\nThere are so many lies we buy into in an effort to find joy outside of a surrendered relationship with God. Genesis introduces sin, and in Genesis 3 we read the account of an interaction between the deceiver and the woman. This conversation reveals the lies that started humanity's long stint of wandering.\n“Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, ‘Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?’ The woman said to the serpent, ‘We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’’ ‘You will not certainly die,’ the serpent said to the woman. ‘For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’ When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves” (Genesis 3:1-7, emphasis added).\nIn this passage of Scripture, we notice four lies the serpent uses to pull the first humans away from God’s best.\nPhoto credit: ©Getty Images/lchumpitaz\nAmanda Idleman is a writer whose passion is to encourage others to live joyfully.

    "text": "Feyi-Waboso returns as England change 12 for USA with 6 debutants\nBeauden Barrett’s status for the third and final All Blacks Test against France has been confirmed by his absence from the team naming, and there’s potential it won’t be the only Test the centurion misses.\nA hand injury has sidelined the 34-year-old for the coming week, but further tests are needed to determine the extent of the damage.\nBarrett suffered a broken hand partway through the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season, and it is again his right hand that was strapped up at All Blacks training on Thursday.\nAt the team naming press conference, All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson confirmed the injury had been sustained at training.\n“I’m not a doctor, but it was a little bit puffy,” Robertson said. “So, we looked after him.”\n“He was an option to play, he was considered, but we just want to look after him.”\nThe Rugby Championship kicks off in one month’s time with the All Blacks facing Los Pumas in Córdoba. Should the hand injury be another break, Barrett would certainly be in doubt for that campaign opener.\nThe expected recovery period for a broken hand is six to eight weeks, a timeline that would put Barrett in doubt to play the Springboks at Eden Park.\nThe playmaker wasn’t the only one watching All Blacks training on Thursday, with Tupou Vaa’i (concussion) running through individual training work and team captain, Scott Barrett, offering some mentorship as he nurses a calf injury.\nAnkle injuries have also befallen Caleb Clarke and Wallace Sititi, while Tamaiti Williams has a knee complaint.\nIs it really the 'All Black way' to move Vaa'i, a stand-out lock forward, to the back-row when other hybrid options may be better suited to the role?\nThe good news for the All Blacks is the respective returns of Tyrel Lomax, Luke Jacobson, and Anton Lienert-Brown, who have each missed the series to date with injuries. Sevu Reece is also back in black, having missed all but the first minute of the series with a concussion.\nRobertson was thrilled to have so many of his troops back on deck and bringing experience to a new-look matchday 23.\n“It’s good. Tyrel was 50/50 last week to play. There were some scrummaging sessions where, I tell you what, he definitely let us know he’s available.\n“And the likes of Anton, 80-odd Tests, hell of an experienced player, just what you need in games like this; the third of a three-match series and just as important as the first to us.”\nNews, stats, videos and more!

    "text": "recent study by the Council for Climate and Conflict Action Asia (CCAA) showed that incidents of violence have been increasing in Mindanao since 2021, which may have an impact on next year's local elections.\nIn its Conflict Alert Triennial 2021-2023 Report, the CCAA warned that this may affect the peace and security situation in the region during the upcoming 2025 May elections and the Bangsamoro parliamentary polls.\nAccording to the study, among the factors contributing to the growing violence is the proliferation of illicit drugs and illegal firearms in the shadow economy.\nAlso affecting the peace situation in the region is identity-related violence, which includes clan feuding over land and political office, persistent extremist violence, as well as violent political contestation.\n“The main causes of deaths between the years 2011-2023 were identity conflicts,” said CCAA Trustee Nikki del Rosario.\n“We classify identity conflict, usually the incident is combined with violent extremism...Kaya mataas 'yung incidents of deaths because the manifestations of identity conflict are clan feuding, violent extremism, non-Moro Indigenous People-related (NMIP) conflicts,” said del Rosario.\n(The death incidents were high because the manifestations of identity conflict are clan feuding, violent extremism, non-Moro Indigenous People-related (NMIP) conflicts.)\n“Usually identity conflicts are combined with other causes. In most cases, it's political combined with shadow economies,” she added.\nExtremists\nMeanwhile, the study showed that violent incidents were concentrated in areas under the Bangsamoro government, particularly Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao provinces.\nThis is due to the vertical assaults from extremists and insurgents as well as the horizontal assault stemming from the schisms between Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) members, it added.\n“We're receiving data of people getting killed and the numbers were increasing and were only halfway of 2024. Our numbers are reaching nearly the incidents of the entire 2023. You still have 2025 elections,” said Lara.\nAside from increased violence, the research also said there may also be deaths and displacements multiply among vulnerable sectors including NMIPs, and intensified internal armed struggles involving MILF, Moro National Liberation Front, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, Dawlah Islamiya, and the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front.\nIt also said coordinated and cooperative armed attacks against state forces may likely increase and the links between illicit drugs, weapons, and electoral campaigns may become stronger.\nTo mitigate the conflict, the research said there should be an “all hands-on-deck” approach for the 2025 elections including mediating of violent and longstanding feuds, redundant and autonomous monitoring of systems and organizations, as well as collaborative responses from the media.\nIn conducting the study, the CCAA used police and media reports to gather violent conflict data in five provinces of the Bangsamoro region. It also utilized a multi-stakeholder Validation Group, which was composed of members from diverse backgrounds, with local knowledge of violent conflict in the areas covered by conflict alert. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

    "title": "OPPO lanza Find N5: el teléfono plegable de tipo libro más delgado del mundo con un diseño sin...",
    "text": "OPPO, la marca líder mundial de dispositivos inteligentes, anunció la disponibilidad en México de su smartphone plegable insignia Find N5. Este dispositivo redefine la excelencia de los teléfonos plegables, ya que ofrece experiencias inigualables con su diseño delgado y liviano, la pantalla interna más grande de cualquier dispositivo plegable de tipo libro, una duración de batería líder en su clase y un rendimiento impulsado por IA de última generación.\n“El Find N5 libera el potencial de los teléfonos plegables, poniendo en nuestras manos la experiencia de una tableta o una computadora portátil. Es increíblemente delgado y liviano, y ColorOS 15 está ajustado con precisión para hacer más en dos pantallas inmersivas con herramientas impulsadas por IA e integración avanzada con Mac. El dispositivo no cierra puertas, las abre, desplegando el potencial de toda tu tecnología mientras te mantiene conectado todo el día y más allá”, menciona Pete Lau, SVP y director de productos de OPPO.\nDelgado, Ligero y Duradero\nEl Find N5 es el teléfono plegable de tipo libro más delgado del mundo cuando está cerrado. Con tan solo 8.93 mm, no es más grueso que un teléfono tradicional y, con un peso pluma de 229 g, es increíblemente ligero. Su diseño de primera calidad y su tacto agradable se combinan con los laterales planos para crear un agarre seguro, con metal contorneado y peso equilibrado para una sujeción personalizada como ninguna otra.\nElija entre dos opciones de color Find N5: Negro Galáctico, que combina un acabado negro esmerilado clásico y recatado con un marco de metal negro mate maduro. Mientras que el color Blanco Niebla brilla al momento que la parte posterior, rica en capas, capta la luz y su marco plateado brilla de manera tentadora.\nHermoso y duradero, el Find N5 es el primer dispositivo plegable con clasificación IPX9 del mundo. Además de su resistencia al agua IPX8, ha sido probada para soportar chorros de agua a temperaturas extremas.\nLa arquitectura Escudo de Armadura de OPPO fortalece la integridad estructural del Find N5. El marco está fabricado con un compuesto de aleación de aluminio de la serie 7000, lo que aumenta un 30% su resistencia. Con un Vidrio Nanocristalino Ultradelgado, la pantalla de la cubierta se beneficia de una mejora de hasta un 20% en la resistencia a las caídas.\nSuave y Segura: la Bisagra Flexible de Aleación de Titanio de OPPO\nLa durabilidad de clase mundial del Find N5 se extiende a su Bisagra Flexible de Titanio, que es un 26% más pequeña pero un 36% más rígida que la generación anterior, gracias a una estructura renovada y materiales mejorados.\nEsta estructura se desliza suavemente al abrirla y cerrarla, mientras que los lados planos y contorneados crean un agarre perfecto. Con la certificación de plegado confiable de TÜV Rheinland, el Find N5 se prueba en entornos extremos para brindar la máxima tranquilidad.\nDos Pantallas Grandes\nCon 8.12 pulgadas cuando está abierto, el Find N5 tiene la pantalla interna más grande de cualquier plegable de tipo libro, y cuando está cerrado, la pantalla de cubierta de 6.62 pulgadas y 20.7:9 es expansiva, familiar y cómoda.\nA pesar de su diseño delgado y de bolsillo, la pantalla desplegada de 8.12” es más grande que la de algunas tabletas populares del mercado. Crea una funcionalidad dos en uno y te da espacio para una productividad, creatividad y entretenimiento de nivel superior. Y con un pliegue angosto y poco profundo líder en su clase, te invita a fluir mientras navegas por él, sin interrupciones. El Find N5 también es el primer teléfono inteligente en obtener la Certificación de Pliegue Minimizado de TÜV Rheinland, lo que consolida aún más su estatus de líder en la industria.\nLas dos pantallas del Find N5 se ven geniales y brindan un cuidado avanzado de la vista. Muestran contenido con una claridad de más de 400 PPP, se deslizan con una frecuencia de actualización suave de 1 a 120 Hz y emiten con un brillo máximo de más de 2000 nits cuando muestran contenido HDR, por lo que las aplicaciones, los juegos y las películas se ven sensacionales, ya sea abiertas o cerradas.\nLa Mejor Duración de Batería de Cualquier Plegable\nEste smartphone dura más y ofrece la mejor batería de cualquier teléfono plegable. Gracias a su batería de doble celda de 5600 mAh de capacidad ultraalta, establece un nuevo estándar, ya que dura más de un día completo y supera a la competencia tanto plegable como no plegable.\nEsta innovadora duración de batería solo es posible con la batería de silicio-carbono de última generación de OPPO, que cuenta con un 10% de silicio líder en la industria, lo que da como resultado una celda increíblemente delgada de 2,1 mm a pesar de su capacidad líder en su clase.\nA diferencia de la competencia plegable, el Find N5 no sacrifica la velocidad de carga gracias a la carga SUPERVOOCTM de 80 W y la AIRVOOCTM de 50 W, ofrece horas de uso con solo unos minutos de carga. Cuando se combina con una funda magnética OPPO, el teléfono puede disfrutar de una carga inalámbrica AIRVOOCTM de 50 W de alta velocidad con la comodidad de la carga y el montaje magnéticos.\nPoder, Privacidad y Fotografía\nEl Find N5, es el primer dispositivo plegable que se lanza con una plataforma móvil Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, cuenta con un rendimiento, una computación de IA y una eficiencia excepcionales. La NPU Hexagon ofrece una mejora del 45% en el rendimiento de la IA, mientras que la arquitectura de 3 nm de segunda generación garantiza que la batería de alta capacidad dure aún más.\nEl Find N5 abre nuevas posibilidades con su Sistema de Cámara Master Hasselblad. Al combinar una cámara ultra gran angular para vistas amplias, una cámara principal gran angular para tomas multipropósito y zoom 2x sin pérdida, y una potente cámara periscópica para fotos y videos de largo alcance, Find N5 es una herramienta creativa versátil.\nA pesar de su perfil ultradelgado, la Cámara Periscópica del Find N5 combina un sensor de 50 MP de alta resolución con una distancia focal de 70 mm, una rápida apertura de f/2.7 y OIS. Al desbloquear la captura macro con telefoto, enfoca un sujeto a una distancia de hasta 10 cm del lente, lo que ofrece la posibilidad de tomar fotografías con telemacro por primera vez en un dispositivo OPPO, por lo que, ya sea que estés fotografiando alimentos, flores, insectos o productos, este teléfono ofrece una imagen nítida.\nExperiencias ultrainteligentes en Pantalla Grande\nEl Find N5 se lanzará con Android 15, recibirá cinco años de actualizaciones de seguridad para una tranquilidad duradera y estará impulsado por ColorOS 15, brindando la última generación de experiencias OPPO y capacidades de inteligencia artificial a los dispositivos plegables.\nCon la nueva función de traducción e interpretación en dos pantallas del Find N5 y la práctica compatibilidad con eSIM, es el compañero ideal para los viajeros por el mundo. Simplemente abre la Aplicación Traductor, activa el intérprete en dos pantallas, dobla el teléfono y empieza a hablar para que cada hablante pueda ver la traducción en vivo. El Find N5 derriba las barreras del idioma en segundos.\nColorOS 15 también presenta Circle to Search de Google. Simplemente haz un círculo para buscar cualquier cosa en tu teléfono, sin cambiar de aplicación. Y con la aplicación Google Gemini, tu asistente de inteligencia artificial de Google, puedes obtener ayuda para aprender de nuevas maneras, escribir correos electrónicos, planificar eventos y más.\nOPPO cierra la brecha entre las computadoras MacOS y el Find N5\nCon la aplicación O+ Connect para Mac instalada, puedes compartir fotos, videos y archivos sin problemas y a una velocidad superrápida entre dispositivos. O+ Connect incluso admite acceso remoto, por lo que puedes transferir archivos fácilmente desde tu computadora a tu Find N5 de forma remota o tomar el control de la interfaz de tu Mac cuando estás de viaje y tu Mac está a kilómetros de distancia.\nToca para Compartir presentado en la serie Find X8, también permite compartir y recibir con un solo toque desde dispositivos iOS y iPadOS con su teléfono inteligente ColorOS.\nDisponibilidad y Precio del OPPO Find N5\nEl OPPO Find N5 está disponible en dos colores: Negro Galáctico y Blanco Niebla, con 16GB + 512GB a un precio de 44,999 MXN.",
