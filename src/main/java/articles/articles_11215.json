Pixel Screenshots organizes screen captures for easy access. Quick Tap on Pixel 9 enables actions with rear taps. Live Caption adds subtitles to any audio on your phone. The dust has largely settled on the Pixel 9 and Google's latest smartphones are undeniably a critical success. The company hasn't only made its most polished hardware to date, it's also introduced features to Android that make Pixels feel unique in comparison to just about every other smartphone out there. And with the launch of Android 15 and a new Pixel Feature Drop , all of Google's smartphones are getting that much better.\nAndroid, on the whole, is much more streamlined than it used to be, with plenty of customization options to take advantage of (some good enough that Apple copied them ) and AI-powered skills to try and fit in your daily workflow. If you just got a Pixel 9, but haven't explored all of its features, or you're using the release of Android 15 as motivation to put your phone through its paces, we've got a selection of tips and tricks below that are a perfect example of what the Pixel 9 is capable of.\nRead our review The Pixel 9 is a nearly perfect Android phone that also terrifies me The Pixel 9 delivers stunning performance and design, but its Reimagine AI tool truly scares me.\n1 Use Pixel Screenshots to organize and remember your digital life Google's tool lets you build a searchable library of things you've seen on your phone\nWe've already dived into many of the new Al-driven features Google used the Pixel 9 to introduce, but it bears repeating: You have to try Pixel Screenshots. Google's AI vision tool bears some similarities to Microsoft's Recall feature , but it's driven by what you want to screenshot, and won't automatically capture what's on your screen. When the Pixel Screenshots app is active, whatever you do want to screenshot gets automatically cataloged by your Pixel 9, making it both searchable, and in some cases, actionable. The Pixel Screenshots app can turn your screenshots into direct links to web pages and calendar events, for example.\nWhen the Pixel Screenshots app is active, whatever you do want to screenshot gets automatically cataloged by your Pixel 9, making it both searchable, and in some cases, actionable.\nThe app is perfect for saving information from a text or email to refer back to later, or a specific item you want to buy and need a direct link to. Google has also started integrating the app directly with Gemini, which means you can pull up information with your voice or a quick text prompt to Gemini rather than having to search through the Screenshots app.\nRelated How I use my Pixel 9's Screenshots app to remember everything The Pixel 9 uses its on-device Gemini Nano model to analyze and catalog every screenshot you take. Here’s how to use it best.\n2 Trigger actions by tapping the back of your Pixel 9 The back of your Pixel can act as an extra button\nIf you're looking for an easy way to do some of the more dexterous actions your Pixel 9 requires, Google has its own take on Apple's Back Tap accessibility feature that lets you use your Pixel to trigger a variety of actions on your phone. The feature is called Quick Tap, and can be subbed in for skills that might normally require pressing one or multiple buttons, and instead, subsitituting them with a double or triple tap on the back of your phone. When enabled, Quick Tap can:\nTake a screenshot Access Gemini or Google Assistant Play or pause media Show recent apps Show notifications Toggle the flashlight Open a specific app\nIf you want to turn it on your phone, you'll need to head to Settings.\nOpen the Settings app . Tap on System . Tap on Gestures . Tap on \"Quick Tap to start actions.\" Then tap on the Use Quick Tap toggle , and select which action you want to use by tapping on it. If you find that you often accidentally trigger Quick Tap, you can also have your phone require \"stronger taps\" to trigger whatever action you've assigned on the same Settings screen.\nRelated How to use the Samsung Galaxy back tap gesture This handy shortcut can give you a bunch of new options on your phone.\n3 Reveal your notification history even after they've been deleted Your Pixel can keep track of all the notifications you've received\nLike other smartphones, the Pixel 9 has a dedicated section or \"notification shade\" that collects and sorts messages, alerts, and let's face it, ads, from your various apps. Most of the time, you address these notifications or swipe them away and go about your day, but what happens if you actually need the information in one of those alerts? Well, Google actually has a hidden way to view the notification history on your phone, it just needs to be turned on.\nYou'll have to access it in Settings via the Notifications section or you can just wait until your notification shade is empty:\nSwipe down to access the notification shade. With an empty notification list, tap with two fingers . Your phone will switch to the Notification section of Settings. Tap on Notification History and toggle it on. From now on, when you t wo-finger tap on an empty notification shade you'll see your notification history. 4 Add yourself to a group shot with Add Me Your Pixel can use AI to add you to a group photo\nGoogle One of the Pixel 9's exclusive abilities is a new photography tool Google calls \"Add Me\" that gives you the ability to take a group photo without a tripod, having arms long enough for a good selfie, or rely on a separate photographer. Your Pixel 9 essentially combines two photos, one of you, the photographer, and another of the people you want to be in the photo with, into a single seamless photo that looks like you had someone else take.\nYou can access Add Me directly in the Camera app:\nOpen the Camera app . Tap on Add Me on the left side of the screen. Follow the on-screen prompts to scan the space and capture a photo. Hand-off your phone to the people you just captured and have them use the onscreen guide to shoot a photo of you . Let your Pixel 9 combine the photos and create a group shot.\nRelated 5 cool things Google's Gemini AI can do on your Pixel 9 The new Google Pixel 9 phones have some exclusive AI features.\n5 Use Live Caption to add captions to audio and video The Pixel 9 can transcribe audio on your phone, regardless of where it's from\nPixel phones have the ability to add captions and audio description to any sound on your phone, regardless if it was designed to have subtitles or not. It's called Live Caption , and it goes beyond video content, too. If you're listening to a podcast or song, your Pixel can caption that audio as well. This uses the same transcription abilities that are already present in an app like Recorder and turns them into an accessibility superpower that applies to all the audio on your phone.\nYou can adjust the size, font, and other qualities of your captions with Live Caption as well.\nYou can turn Live Caption on by adjusting the volume on your phone:\nPress the volume button . Tap on the three-dot menu at the bottom of the on-screen volume control. Tap on Live Caption (the text box icon) near the bottom of the screen. Agree to any onscreen prompts and captions should appear anytime spoken words are playing on your phone.\nRelated What are Apple Live Captions and how do they work? Apple has announced a slew of new accessibility features, including Live Captions.\n6 Make your Pixel 9 easier to use one-handed There's a way to reach the top of your giant phone screen without getting new hands\nPhones are not getting smaller anytime soon, and that's unfortunate, because not everyone is able to reach the top of their phone screen without using two hands. Pixels do have a built-in way to get around the big screen that can help you reach your notifications or just anything at the top of your screen. The option is called One-Handed Mode, and it lets you swipe the bottom of your Pixel rather than the top to access notifications or virtually pull the top of your screen down to reach what you need.\nTo turn on One-Handed mode:\nOpen the Settings app . Tap on Gestures . Tap on \"One-Handed Mode\". Toggle the feature on and decide if you're going to use it for notification or reaching the top of the screen.\nRelated How to use Android 12's new one-handed mode Android 12 has a built-in one-handed mode that makes it easier to reach the top of the screen, here's how to activate it.\n7 Learn more about whatever is on your screen with Circle to Search Look up whatever is on your screen with a few taps\nIt's highly possible you've already triggered it by accident, but even if it's over-eager, Circle to Search is one of the better new features Google has added to Android in the last year. By long-pressing the navigation bar or home button at the bottom of your screen, you can enable Circle to Search and effectively Google anything you circle with your finger. This works on both text and images, even in videos, and can also be used to translate text too. It's incredibly useful for finding things that would normally be hard to search for with text alone, and it could soon extend to live video too .\nIf you didn't enable Circle to Search when you were first setting up your phone, you can turn it on in Settings:\nOpen the Settings app . Tap on Display & Touch . Tap on Navigation Mode . Toggle Circle to Search on. Hold down the bottom navigation bar and circle anywhere on your screen to search it. 1:00\nRelated What is Google Circle to Search and how does it work on Android?

Here's everything you need to know.\nYour Pixel 9 is a lot more powerful than it seems Google's no slouch when it comes to updating Android, but years of software releases mean that there are layers of functionality built into every Pixel phone (and most Android devices for that matter) that never gets fully explained. This is the nature of every mature operating system (you don't even want to know the kinds of things Windows or macOS can do), but considering how often we use our smartphones, figuring out the Pixel 9 feels more pressing.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pixel 9 features a 6.3-inch display and a familiar design. It supports the addition of a 48-megapixel ultrawide lens to its rear camera array alongside Google Gemini and AI features.\n$800 at Google $800 at Amazon $800 at Best Buy The list above is a great starting point for learning what your phone can actually do, but if you're curious about learning more nitty-gritty details about your phone, we've got you covered, with guides on finding hiding apps on your Pixel , and making sure apps running in the background aren't ruining your phone's performance.\nPhones Google Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Readers like you help support Pocket-lint.

    "text": "WCIA Champaign Illinois prohibits discrimination on reproductive health decisions with law effective Jan. 1 Danny Connolly Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:40 PM UTC 1 min read\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WCIA) — An Illinois law protecting people against discrimination of reproductive health decisions will go into effect at the start of 2025.\nState leaders said no one should face discrimination for the personal decisions they make about their reproductive health, including getting fertility care and an abortion.\n“This legislation is more than a law—it’s a declaration of human dignity,” Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton said. “We’re affirming that personal medical decisions belong to individuals, not employers or institutions. Illinois is not just protecting a right; we’re championing a fundamental principle of personal autonomy and bodily integrity.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement New law giving relaxation time to students in IL begins Jan. 2025\nThe law protects discrimination from areas like employment, housing, financial credit, and public accommodations. It clarifies and extends the civil rights protections in the Illinois Human Rights Act.\nReproductive health decisions protected under the law include using technologies to assist like in-vitro fertilization, pre-, intra-, and postnatal care, abortion and birth control, fertility or sterilization and miscarriage management.\n“The law is a common-sense measure to ensure that personal decisions about reproductive care do not affect a person’s livelihood,” Illinois Department of Human Rights Director, Jim Bennett, said. “This law protects Illinoisans and visitors from discrimination or retaliation based on the decisions they need to make concerning whether, when, and how to start a family.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement New Illinois law requires interpreters at state agency administrative hearings\nThe full language of the law can be found here . Officials said anyone with questions on the Illinois Human Rights Act or rules and regulations from IDHR should call (312) 814-6262 or complete the Contact IDHR online form .\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "title": "Meteo: in arrivo una lunga Ottobrata con Sole e Temperature miti su tutta Italia. L'analisi di Antonio Sanò",
    "text": "Abbiamo chiesto ad Antonio Sanò, fondatore de [iLMeteo.it](https://www.ilmeteo.it/), cosa succederà nei prossimi giorni. E' confermata la decisa rimonta dell’alta pressione sull’Italia con la cessazione delle forti piogge che hanno colpito soprattutto il Centro-Nord nella prima decade di Ottobre. Come saranno le prossime ore? Avremo ancora qualche residuo addensamento specie sul Triveneto orientale, in Toscana e sul Basso Tirreno accompagnato da locali piovaschi; per il resto il tempo sarà in deciso miglioramento ovunque. Ci sarà un aumento delle temperature? Inizialmente non proprio e… non del tutto: le temperature scenderanno leggermente a causa di venti più freschi dai quadranti settentrionali, specie al Sud e in Sardegna, ma torneremo a percepire il calore del sole da Nord a Sud; gli ultimi 10 giorni perturbati hanno offuscato la memoria delle belle e serene giornate autunnali di una volta a molti abitanti del Centro-Nord. Torneremo a rivivere queste belle giornate autunnali? Certamente, già nel weekend rivivremo queste belle giornate con il sole che tornerà ad illuminare il foliage dei boschi; a tratti, il sole sarà disturbato da correnti più umide solo al Nord-Ovest e in montagna con addensamenti comunque non forieri di precipitazioni. Lungo le coste il sole scalderà quasi ovunque fino a valori gradevoli: sono previste massime di 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27°C in Puglia e Calabria, 25-26°C in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24°C, Firenze a 22°C e Milano sui 20°C. Quali sono le temperature normali in questo periodo a Milano e Roma? La media delle temperature massime di Ottobre a Milano è 18°C, sulla Capitale 22°C; entro il weekend, dunque, saliremo nelle due principali città italiane di 2 gradi oltre i valori climatologici: niente di eccezionale, ma l’umore ringrazierà, dopo tante giornate grigie. Un'ottima notizia! Il bel tempo continuerà anche la prossima settimana? Sembra di sì: addirittura, le ultime emissioni dei modelli indicano la possibilità della persistenza del bel tempo quasi fino alla fine del mese, con una lunga e mite Ottobrata su buona parte del Paese. In questa proiezione meteo ottimistica troviamo solo due veloci passaggi perturbati Venerdì 18 e Venerdì 25 Ottobre; per il resto l’anticiclone potrebbe fermarsi a lungo sul nostro Paese. La lunga Ottobrata prevista è solo una tendenza da confermare ma, per uscire dal tunnel del maltempo dei primi 10 giorni di Ottobre, è l’unica previsione meteo a cui vogliamo credere.",

    "title": "Kinder Morgan: My Top Income Pick For 2024",
    "text": "2023 was a banner year for stocks, but that’s only if one goes by the end result while ignoring the tough times in March, October, and November. While no one can tell you with certainty what 2024 will bring for the overall market, I would bet that it’s hard to go wrong with sensible picks that remain value-priced and with high income.\nSuch I find the case to be with Kinder Morgan (NYSE:\nKMI), which I last visited here back in September with a ‘Buy’ rating. Like many income stocks, KMI has come a long way since then, having seen ups and downs due to concerns around interest rates and economic uncertainty, both of which have since abated.\nSince my last coverage, the stock has risen by 6.6% and gave investors and an 8.5% total return thanks to dividends, just underperforming the 10.7% rise in the S&P 500 (\nSPY). Despite the recent uptick, KMI remains down 3% for 2023, as shown below. In this article, I provide an update and discuss why KMI is attractive at present for income in 2024 and beyond, so let’s get started!\nWhy KMI?\nKinder Morgan owns one of the biggest pipeline networks in North America, which has been expanded since its recent acquisition of natural gas pipelines from NextEra Energy Partners (\nNEP). Speaking of which, this transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per share while increasing KMI’s net debt to EBITDA by just 0.1x.\nKMI’s EBDA (earnings before depreciation and amortization) is comprised of 62% natural gas, 15% refined products, 12% terminals, and 11% CO2 transport. To get a sense of KMI’s mission-critical assets, its 70K miles of natural gas pipelines move around 40% of U.S. natural gas production, and it has 700 bcf of working storage capacity, enough to store 15% of U.S. natural gas. As shown below KMI’s pipelines and terminals run from coast to coast and along the Houston Ship Channel.\nUnlike upstream producers, KMI enjoys highly contracted cash flows with 87% of cash flows being either take-or-pay (entitled to payment regardless of throughput) or fee-based (fixed fee collected regardless of commodity price) with an additional 6% of cash flows being hedged to stem volatility in commodity prices.\nThis has enabled KMI to return durable and growing cash flows to shareholders. As shown below, KMI has increased its adjusted EBITDA by 18% since 2016, all while reducing its leverage ratio by 23% and returning over $17 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nSpeaking of which, KMI has continued to increase its dividend this year, which is 2% higher than where it was in 2022. The forward annualized dividend rate of $1.13 per share is also well-covered by cash flows, as reflected by its 53% payout ratio based on $2.13 per share in distributable cash flow budgeted for the full year 2023, leaving plenty of retained capital to pay down debt or fund capital projects.\nMeanwhile, KMI’s portfolio of assets continue to perform well, with natural gas transport and gathering volumes up 5% and 11% YoY, respectively, during the third quarter. Moreover, gasoline volumes were up 1% and jet fuel volumes continued to rebound, being up 5% YoY compared to the prior year period. These operating metrics contribute to management expectations for full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 billion, which would be 3% higher than the\n$7.5 billion from full year 2022.\nLooking ahead, I would expect to see continued growth for KMI in 2024 as management continues to add opportunities to the backlog, which now stands at $3.8 billion. Longer term, opportunities beyond the backlog exist as demand growth is expected to be driven by LNG, where many\nexporters are interested in capacity further upstream to secure more diverse supply at competitive prices.\nDemand is also coming from Mexico and from new Peaker plants in Texas as they convert from coal to natural gas. It’s also worth noting that renewable natural gas provides incremental opportunities for growth, as KMI expects to have up to 6.9 bcf of gross RNG production capacity by the middle of 2024, as part of its platform with Kinetrex, a leading partner in the RNG space.\nTo put things into perspective, the aforementioned amount of RNG production is equivalent to reducing 3.9 million metric tons of CO2 per year. U.S. RNG production has a compelling growth proposition over the next few decades and beyond as landfills are expected to significantly grow over this timeframe, as shown below, and RNG-based vehicles emit up to 75% less emissions than diesel vehicles.\nImportantly, KMI maintains a reasonably strong balance sheet with a BBB investment grade credit rating from S&P. As noted earlier, it’s expected to land at 4.0x net debt to EBITDA for the year-end 2023, and this leverage ratio sits below the 4.5x level generally considered safe by ratings agencies for midstream companies.\nRisks to KMI include potential for higher interest rates in 2024 should the inflation rate be surprisingly high over the next few months, as this would raise KMI’s cost of debt. However, it’s worth noting that KMI doesn’t have any\ndebt maturities between now until June of 2025, thereby mitigating the near-term impact of interest rate volatility.\nOther risks include potential for faster-than-expected transition to renewable energy, but considering that natural gas is cleaner burning compared to other forms of fossil fuels, this transition is expected to take a long time, giving KMI runway to make investments in the RNG space.\nTurning to valuation, I continue to find value in KMI at the current price of $17.64 with a price-to-cash flow of 7.0, sitting below that of peers Williams Companies (\nWMB) and Enterprise Products Partners ( EPD), and on par with that of MPLX ( MPLX).\nKMI’s P/CF also sits at the low end of its 3-year trading range, as shown below. Considering management expectations for Adjusted EBITDA and DCF/share growth of 5% each in 2024, and the 6.4% dividend yield, KMI could deliver a market-beating return in 2024, should the market rotate away from over-priced growth stocks and into sensible value-priced investments.\nInvestor Takeaway\nKMI is a well-diversified midstream company with mission-critical assets that play a crucial role in the U.S. energy industry. With highly contracted cash flows and a strong balance sheet, KMI has been able to consistently return value to shareholders while also investing in growth opportunities. The company's focus on renewable natural gas positions it well for long-term sustainability and growth. At its current valuation, KMI presents a compelling investment opportunity for those looking for value while getting paid a decent yield over 6%. As such, I maintain my 'Buy' rating on KMI stock.\nGen Alpha Teams Up With Income Builder\nGen Alpha has teamed up with\nHoya Capital to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.

    "text": "Pari opportunità, De Dea (Onde rosa), \"Tampon tax, non si può tornare indietro su diritti donne\" Milano, 29 feb. (Adnkronos) - La riduzione della tampon tax, ovvero l’Iva sui prodotti mestruali, “non è soltanto una questione di giustizia economica, ma è una questione di giustizia sociale. Se ogni volta che si parla di diritti, come nel caso di quelli delle donne, questi diritti restano ‘una virgola’ in una Legge di bilancio, e non diventano mai un tema vero e strutturale, allora abbiamo perso una battaglia importante. Continuiamo a portare avanti questa petizione perchè quando si parla di diritti delle donne e di piena parità non si può tornare indietro”. Così Silvia De Dea, tra le fondatrici del collettivo Onde Rosa, a margine della presentazione della quarta edizione della campagna Coop per l’inclusione e la parità di genere “Close the Gap. Riduciamo le differenze”. In questa occasione è stata proposta la sottoscrizione della petizione “Il ciclo è ancora un lusso!”, per l’abbassamento dell’IVA sui prodotti mestruali, rilanciata dal collettivo Onde Rosa su Change.org dopo che l’IVA su questi prodotti è tornata al 10%. Lanciata dal collettivo Onde Rosa nel 2019 e sostenuta da Coop fin dal 2021, la petizione punta al milione di firme. “La campagna è stata creata nel 2019 per dare un obiettivo tangibile alle tante giovani ragazze interessate alla politica, ma non abbastanza da impegnarsi, alzare la voce e scendere in piazza per i loro diritti - racconta De Dea - Abbiamo pensato quindi che un'ingiustizia così semplice e così potente come quella della tampone tax potesse essere compresa da tutte e da tutti, che potesse entrare nelle case delle italiane e degli italiani per spiegare effettivamente cos'è la disparità di genere”. Il successo della precedente raccolta firme testimonia quanto l’approccio di Onde Rosa sia stato vincente. Ora il collettivo, assieme a Coop, di raggiungere lo stesso risultato positivo: “Abbiamo deciso di rilanciare questa petizione - spiega De Dea - Quello dell’Iva sui prodotti mestruali non è un tema nuovo, ma è sempre stato trattato con disinteresse dalla politica, che lo riteneva addirittura scomodo o imbarazzante, quando invece non lo è. Noi vogliamo ribadire invece che questo è tema vero e concreto, che riguardava la vita e la salute di tante donne e tante famiglie, di cui la politica si doveva occupare senza più tabù”. -",
