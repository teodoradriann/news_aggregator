    "title": "Глава Якутии поздравил строителей и назвал отрасль локомотивом развития",
    "text": "Глава Республики Саха (Якутия) Айсен Николаев от имени руководства региона и от себя лично поздравил работников строительной отрасли с Днём строителя. В поздравлении подчёркивается ключевая роль строителей в развитии Якутии, отрасль названа локомотивом развития республики.\nБлагодаря труду строителей возводятся жилые дома, социальные объекты и инфраструктура, что улучшает качество жизни жителей республики. Так, в 2024 году в Якутии введены рекордные 752 тыс. кв. метров жилья — на 40% больше, чем в 2018-м. Эта динамика сохраняется: за первые семь месяцев 2025 года построено уже свыше 400 тыс. кв. метров, причём значительная часть — частные дома.\nВ рамках нацпроектов «Жильё и городская среда» и «Инфраструктура для жизни» ведётся активное строительство социальных объектов. До конца года планируется сдать 44 объекта, включая школы, детские сады, спортивные комплексы и медучреждения.\nПо программе «Доступное арендное жильё в ДФО» до конца 2025 года в Якутии появится 361 арендная квартира: в Якутске, Нерюнгри и Алдане. Идёт активное расселение аварийного жилья: с начала года квартиры получили 3,15 тыс. человек, а всего с 2019-го — почти 50 тыс. якутян. До конца 2025-го планируется переселить ещё 5,2 тыс. нуждающихся.\nАйсен Николаев поблагодарил ветеранов отрасли и молодых специалистов, отметив их вклад в развитие республики. «Желаю крепкого здоровья, семейного благополучия и новых профессиональных побед на благо Якутии и России!» — сказал глава региона.",

    "title": "What is a man without shame?",
    "text": "What is a man without shame? This is a man without morals and honor. And what is a man without morals and honor? Nothing. At first glance, it has a human form, but it is not a civilized human being, since the feeling of shame is the basic characteristic of a normal and healthy person. What is the opposite of shame, as its negation? First of all, the lack of brakes. Since you are not ashamed of anything, you are not alien to any deviant behavior according to the accepted norms of civilized society. You can lie, steal, cheat, manipulate, insult, kidnap, be violent and unscrupulous. You can do whatever comes to your mind and whatever you think is useful for you. There are such people in every society. But in organized communities, such people are on the margins. They are not held back by shame, they are not held back by morals, possibly only by the fear of punishment. In civilized societies, what jumps out of the legal framework is sanctioned by regulations. What is not illegal, but not moral either, is subject to social sanction. In order for this social sanction to work, it is necessary that the \"punished\" person has a sense of shame. If it is not there, the social sanction does not work. The problem is when a society loses the basic characteristics of a civilized community, when those from the margins shamelessly and morally group together, unite and declare themselves the majority, and since they have no brakes, they trample on law, justice, laws, ethics, and even the Constitution itself without any consideration. , and impose their own rules and anti-values. Those who believe in ethics, morality, honesty, first do not fully understand what is happening to them. They are amazed, they retreat, they don't believe that this is possible. Then when they understand, they start to rebel, protest, see what happened to them. If such a condition lasts too long and continues to worsen, they fall into despair and retreat again. Especially when they see how many around them, whom until yesterday they believed were also ethical people with a moral compass, begin to \"fall\" one after the other under the burden of offers that cannot be refused. That is, they can, but it's not worth it. And in the end they realize, to their horror, that society has failed in every possible aspect and that entropy has already engulfed it. Theft and open robbery become a principle, there is no one to oppose the violence, fear has shackled many, laws apply selectively and only to protect the new class. The rule of law experiences its own negation every day, and immorality becomes a principle. Talking about shame becomes out of place, even stupid. If someone rebels against this order, raises his voice, the whole machinery descends on him to cut him down and embarrass him at all costs, because that is precisely the worst punishment for him. It is a demonstrative exercise for others too, to see what awaits them if they too think of some kind of rebellion. The machinery of lies buzzes over everyone's heads. Without the media, which when establishing this anti-system must first be captured, stop being media and turn into propaganda services and well-paid factories of lies, this new anti-system cannot be established. And that with a kind of paradox: now that there is an Internet and its \"eternal memory\", when every lie can be discovered in two clicks, it is not an obstacle at all. What does this show us - that a lie is no longer considered an unacceptable deviation that can embarrass and disqualify the person who utters it from further public speaking. No. He continues on and on and on, not caring at all about himself from yesterday, nor about those who listen to him, nor about those who are supposed to believe him. How that? Well, since those who listen to them have already accepted the lie as a standard, they do not expect the one who utters it to be ashamed of it, they do not even condemn him. This is achieved by increased action - the factory of lies works tirelessly, in three shifts, it never shuts down. Yesterday's lies are buried by today's lies, and today's lies are buried by tomorrow's lies, and no one remembers that anymore. Thus, the difference between truth and lies, morality and immorality, good and evil is completely erased over time. They lie shamelessly, unscrupulously, as if there is no tomorrow. There is no fear of sanctions because there is no one left to enforce them, since the same ones are sitting there. They are also not uncomfortable that many people still understand and remember that they are lies. This is how this personal pathology spreads and turns into a social pathology. The country is collapsing materially, because it is looting without measure, scruples and brakes (robbers have never been scrupulous in history), but it is collapsing morally even more. The whole society is turning into reality. A gallery of the most outrageous characters without occupation and life compass occupying television with a national frequency and showing deviant behavior of all kinds without any leeway. The worse, the more you pay. That \"program\" is then grabbed by the tabloids and continues to spread the mission of collapsing the value system. This is ideally followed by political reality, which, in terms of the behavior of the actors and the \"values\" it promotes, is not far behind this \"folk\" one. And then one moment you realize that nothing beyond that exists anymore. There is nothing. No culture, no art, no music, no theater, no success of ordinary people, no beauty, no goodness. Nothing but lies and reality shows. If society finds the strength to pull itself out of this calamity, there is still hope to be saved. It won't be easy, it won't happen overnight, getting sober will be difficult and painful, but that catharsis must be passed. If shame returns to society as the supreme principle, then everything else returns with a domino effect. Bonus video:",

    "text": "Human rights groups say 36,000 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the last two decades, including Mrs. Son, a former official of the North Korean military. During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.\nShe told CBN News, \"My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.\"\nIn order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.\n\"We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,\" Mrs. Son said.\nAfter a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.\n\"My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.\"\nMrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.\n\"Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.\"\nAfter yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.\n\"The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released… malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,\" Mrs. Son recounted.\nOnce in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.\nThe name of the church, \"Seopyoung\" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.\nRev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, \"It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.\"\n\"During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,\" he reports. \"Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.\"\nNorth Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.\n\"I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,\" Mrs. Son said.\nShare This article",
