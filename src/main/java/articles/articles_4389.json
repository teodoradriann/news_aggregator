    "title": "5 Signs of a Demotivated Workforce",
    "text": "People may think identifying demotivation or loss of inspiration is easy. But being a Top Motivational Speaker in India has taught me that it is not. Because the symptoms of demotivation are not always a sad & depressed face. We often mask our lesser inspirations into portrayals that could be dicey.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\n1. They will be demotivating other employees 2. Loss of Productivity 3. No visible sign of fun 4. Absenteeism 5. Not wanting to Improve If we take the workplace into picture, how do you identify these crucial signs? I have had the opportunity to talk to some of the brilliant sales teams of top corporates in India & by God’s grace, could understand the people in this tough much profession with a little more depth. Let me share you with what I think could be 5 signs of a demotivated sales force:\n1. They will be demotivating other employees\nI got fired from my first two jobs for demotivating others. Surely, they did a very good job of identifying demotivated employee! I never had any love for that job.\nIt is true. A demotivated salesperson will spread negativity all around him/her. Their lack of interest in their own targets breeds discontent in them, which leads to frustration. Has to come out somewhere and on someone. But they will also need to not make it apparent to their colleagues that they are not quite enjoying their work because – you know – office politics.\nSo, they wrap it up nicely under contempt for their bosses and targets, negativity for life in general and their job in particular. Demotivation is a package. Comes with disregard for positivity and a need to spread it around. A demotivated salesperson may think he/she is sharing his/her woes with fellow colleagues. But, we become who we surround ourselves with. This constant small dose of demotivation slowly starts percolating down to others as well.\n2. Loss of Productivity This is an easy one. But then, how do you measure / recognize? It is not just the input output ratio that one needs to look at.\nOf course you look at the output. But more importantly, you need to look at the trend of the output over the last couple of weeks / months / whatever your timeline is. If it has been consistently dropping for reasons which are external to the situations at the workplace, it is a sure fire sign of demotivation.\nIt also brings with itself, loss of efficiency. If you could find a way to map the efficiencies of your salesforce, you would know that targets are not the only answer. How much they accomplish in day (vis a vis how much they used to earlier), how are they utilizing their available resources and taking decisions – has the quality of decisions taken a set back? Do you not find them stellar enough these days? Does it feel like they are slipping towards the ordinary more?\nIf yes, they are probably demotivated.\n3. No visible sign of fun\nSales is a tough job. Those who excel at it, achieve that excellence after much effort , sacrifices, and hard work. At one point, it takes a toll on people too. Only those who truly love this profile, can actually manage to stay happy and find a way to enjoy despite all the toil and turmoil.\nSo, if your sales team is really gloomy and sad and there is no laughter that you can hear from cabins, it may be an indicator that the collective morale is down. How do you sense vibes around people? Our state of mind transforms into energies which become the aura around us. A negative state of mind can bring out a positive aura only when you are dealing with someone who excels in acting skills. For the rest of us, faking is the only option. And not all of us are good fakers.\nYour sales people may have the ability to plaster a huge smile when they go for cold calling or client meets. But in their natural setting, if they are not cheerful and happy, something is bothering them and they are definitely not motivated enough.\nIn fact, Richard Branson had this policy that when someone calls a Virgin office, the caller should be able to hear raging laughter from behind because he knew and so should all those concerned – only happy people are more successful!\n4. Absenteeism Now this one was easy\nAbsenteeism and frequent employee turnover is one of the most common symptoms of a demotivated workforce. If a considerable / noticeable number of your employees have left you within an average tenure of 3months – 2 years, it is a sure sign of they not being satisfied and moving on.\nNow, it is quite common for people to keep shifting jobs. But, you need to ensure that they don’t leave because of something wrong being done on your behalf. One way of knowing & improving is – Exit interviews. This may be tedious but a lot of HR managers do get these exit interviews from people who are serving a notice period to understand what went wrong from their side. So that mistakes don’t get repeated often.\nOne cannot really stop employees from not coming to work. But it becomes your duty as a manager to make them really want to come. The daily part of the salary shouldn’t be the only motivator. Because slowly, that will surely lead to demotivation. They should be given more to look forward to, that makes them feel valuable and relevant to your organization.\nDon’t just crib as to why your employees are not turning up. Get to the roots. And then uproot if it’s a bad sapling!\n5. Not wanting to Improve\nI will put it the other way. A motivated employee will really want to improve his/her skills without you pushing them for trainings. They will look for ways to learn new things and gather new concepts / ways to do their old jobs. They will know how to fight the quite inevitable monotonies by becoming better themselves – and by bringing in new challenges as a part of keeping it alive.\nOn the other hand, for a demotivated employee, it will be a chore, a boss’s order – to attend any webinar, workshop, training program etc. They will crib about having to waste their time on stupid sessions, on how useless they are and blah blah without any obvious, automatic improvements in their performance.\nThese are just 5 signs that I have observed over the years as I have interacted with different strata and managerial levels of workforces. There are many more, each relevant differently and in different extremities according to their contexts.\nI would say, do not let this seep in, for as long as you can. Of course, you can’t keep everyone happy. People have complains even with the Almighty God . We are mere mortals. But, a little care and observation could do you a lot of good. As the saying goes, “A stitch in time, saves nine.”\nLet me know if you have any other symptoms that are obvious yet we miss out on them. Would love to share it with people in dire need of the same!",

    "text": "Relations sexuelles avec une ado de 14 ans : douze adultes cachés « derrière un écran pour mieux l’approcher »\nDouze hommes ont comparu ce jeudi devant le tribunal correctionnel de Valenciennes pour avoir eu des relations sexuelles - parfois tarifées - avec une collégienne, dans le Nord. Des peines de deux ans de prison, dont six mois ferme, ont été requises pour la plupart d’entre eux.\nIls sont douze. Des hommes, âgés de 25 à 60 ans, insérés. Ils sont boulanger, informaticien à la Sécu, agriculteur, banquier, intérimaire ou bien employés à l’usine Stellantis. En couple ou séparés, plusieurs ont des enfants. Dans leur très grande majorité, leur casier est vierge. Ils ne se connaissaient pas jusqu’ici mais ont passé la journée\n sur les mêmes bancs du tribunal judiciaire de Valenciennes (Nord). Leur point commun ? Avoir sollicité ou obtenu des relations sexuelles, tarifées ou non, avec Émilie (le prénom a été changé) et avoir échangé des photos pornographiques, fin 2022-début 2023, alors qu’elle n’était âgée que de 14 ans.\nÀ l’encontre de dix d’entre eux, la procureure Juliette Chopin a requis la même peine : deux ans de prison dont six mois ferme. Pour les deux derniers, 18 mois de prison entièrement assortis d’un sursis probatoire. Au-delà des peines, la représentante du ministère public a surtout déploré l’absence de remise en question de la plupart des prévenus, plus prompts à blâmer leur usage des réseaux sociaux qu’à admettre leurs coupables pratiques. « Ce n’est pas le dossier de la malchance, c’est le dossier de 12 adultes qui ont abusé d’une mineure de 14 ans en se cachant derrière un écran pour mieux l’approcher », cingle-t-elle.\nSe connecter",
