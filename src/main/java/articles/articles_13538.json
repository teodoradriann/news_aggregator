Ante asesinatos de candidatos, “que Dios guíe el proceso electoral” 2024: Obispos de México “Combinemos estas prácticas con la vida contemplativa de la Iglesia y ofrezcámoslas sobre todo por nuestra nación, para que Dios guíe el proceso electoral y fortalezca nuestro compromiso por la paz”. “Vivamos este tiempo de gracia en espíritu de sinodalidad, caminando juntos como Iglesia, escuchándonos unos a otros y buscando la voluntad de Dios”. “Que la Virgen de Guadalupe, estrella de la evangelización, nos guíe y acompañe en este camino de fe y servicio”. En su mensaje, los prelados recuerdan: “Nuestra misión como cristianos nos empuja a ser una Iglesia en salida, que lleva la esperanza y el amor de Cristo a todos los rincones de la sociedad, especialmente a los más necesitados”. Y exhortan: “En este mundo difícil, seamos constructores de puentes y sembradores de paz”. Por la paz también en Tierra Santa El mensaje no olvida la situación de conflicto que afecta a Israel y Palestina: “En esta Semana Santa, nuestro saludo fraternal se extiende también a nuestros hermanos y hermanas judíos, que celebran la Pascua judía, conmemorando la liberación del pueblo de Israel”. “También nos sumamos a todas las comunidades eclesiales que profesan la fe en la resurrección de Jesucristo. Invitamos a otras tradiciones religiosas a encender una luz de paz, a unirnos como seres humanos en la construcción de un mundo más fraterno, como una obra de artesanía que requiere el esfuerzo y el compromiso de todos”, concluye el mensaje enviado mediante un comunicado y un vídeo.",

    "title": "The successor project to the SIP is rejected in the local parliament",
    "text": "Civil parties prevail in the Olten parliament: the successor project to the SIP is rejected Previous results are not measurable enough, examine alternatives or sometimes more, sometimes less or no street work: There is great criticism of the continuation of the divided project of security, intervention and prevention. The deal is due to be reconsidered following its rejection in November.\nAvoiding noise and littering, supporting scene-goers with their concerns and referring them to a suitable institution if necessary, and increasing the population’s subjective sense of security: the Security, Intervention and Prevention project, or SIP for short, should do this and more, especially in hotspots in the Oltner region inner city like Kirchgasse.\nAfter the three-year pilot phase, the city council has changed its strategy: the areas of security and intervention and prevention are to be separated in the future. The functioning area of ​​intervention and prevention should be expanded in the form of outreach social work or street work.\nSince July, Securitas has been patrolling Kirchgasse, among other places. It is unclear whether the project will continue in 2025 after the deal was rejected. Bild: Bruno Kissling\nSince the beginning of June, a security service has been patrolling the city’s most important hotspots several times a week, and at the same time a lane office has started operating, which is open once a week for two hours. The city council has decided to definitely introduce the separation of street work and security from the beginning of 2025.\nOn the one hand, in the future there will be outreach social work. This costs 120,000 francs per year. In addition, there is a pure security service that will cost 105,000 francs annually. A total of 225,000 francs, 75,000 francs more than the annual pilot operation of the SIP cost.\nSP wanted to double credit for street work This division of tasks was generally not received badly in the local parliament on Wednesday evening. Nevertheless, there was a hail of criticism. The left half of the council emphasized the importance of street work in particular and was skeptical about the security service, while the citizens saw it exactly the other way around.\nFor the SP/Junge SP faction, outreach social work is a central element in supporting people in precarious life situations. She therefore wanted to double the loan for the street work to 240,000 francs. On the other hand, the party castigated the outsourcing of security to a private institution such as Securitas and clearly rejected a “disguised city police force,” as group spokesman Florian Eberhard put it.\nGroup spokesman Florian Eberhard. Image: Patrick Luethy\nThe Greens made similar statements. Part of the group would like to put all its resources into street work, said spokesman Gian Baumann. But because the overall package is important and they don’t want to endanger it, they support the city council’s proposal.\nFDP submitted a request for rejection The citizens are different: For the SVP, which got the whole SIP pilot project rolling in the first place with a push for Ländiweg in 2017, the focus is on a greater sense of security for the population and thus a more lively city center. The security service is therefore a useful addition to the police, said parliamentary group spokesman Robin Kiefer. However, the party is skeptical about street work and rejects the corresponding loan.\nThe FDP was fundamentally critical of the project because there were no clearly measurable results and they had hoped for more from the SIP pilot project, as spokesman Christian Huber explained. The party therefore did not want to see the business discussed until the November meeting together with the other city council proposals. Until then, alternatives could be examined.\nChristian Huber. Image: zVg\nCity council opposes postponement The city council and the left half of the council, who supported the deal, saw no point in postponing it until the November meeting. SP/Young SP parliamentarian Christine von Arx pointed out that it was an ongoing project that had to be continued. In addition, it is not a job deal and should therefore not be mixed with one.\nChristine von Arx. Image: zVg\nThe two responsible city councilors also spoke out against rejection. With a postponement, the agenda for the November meeting will become even longer, said Mayor Thomas Marbet. In addition, you usually bring in a business when it is ready for treatment and do not wait until the budget meeting – as happened with this one.\nRaphael Schär-Sommer. Bild: Bruno Kissling\nAnd social director Raphael Schär-Sommer drew attention to the consequences: Addiction Help East, which is supposed to take over the street work with outreach social work through a service agreement, would not be ready at the beginning of 2025 if the business was only dealt with in the parliamentary session at the end of November. He also promised to include measurable criteria in the performance contract, thus responding to the previously expressed criticism.\nDespite these reservations, the commoners narrowly prevailed. The deal was rejected by a vote of 18 to 17 and will be put back on the agenda at the double session on November 27th and 28th. Only the EPP representative Beat Bachmann, together with the left-wing factions, voted against a postponement.\nMore articles from these communities",

    "text": "English Español FOX 2 Detroit reporter on JD Vance’s aggressive answer: “I didn’t think that was a bogus question!” JD Vance came off particularly unhinged at a Michigan campaign stop yesterday, where he gave “icy responses” to even the most softball questions like “what makes you smile” — acting hostile and calling the reporter’s question “bogus.” John James’ spin after this embarrassing showing? Blame the media! Answering why he believes the race is “so close,” James bizarrely attempted to claim that “the stories people have been getting from the media have, frankly, been slanted.” According to James, it’s “slanted” to report on topics like JD Vance’s deep connections to Project 2025, his recent bizarre and sexist comments denigrating women, or the prolific history of anti-choice extremism Vance has recently attempted to cover up. It’s also apparently “slanted” to highlight James’ own support for banning abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, his plan to gut Social Security and Medicare, or his laundry list of dark money donors. John James owes Michiganders answers: why is it “slanted” to report MAGA extremists’ very own words and actions? DCCC Spokesperson Aidan Johnson: “Michiganders got up close and personal with JD Vance’s utter lack of charisma yesterday, watching him proudly display his gross extremism as he lashed out at voters and the media alike. John James is happily hitching his wagon to Vance’s disaster, and with fundamentally the same far-right agenda and self-serving beliefs as Vance, there’s no way for James to hide from voters this November.” ### Share on Facebook Share via Email",

    "text": "¡BUENAS NOTICIAS, inmigrantes! Donald Trump pretende eliminar los límites de países para la Green Card\nEl \"Zar de la Inteligencia Artificial\", aclaró que Krishnan propone eliminar límites por país, ya que las solicitudes indias enfrentan largas esperas.\nÚnete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nEl presidente electo de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha nombrado al empresario indio-estadounidense y capitalista de riesgo nacido en Chennai Sriram Krishnan como asesor principal de políticas de inteligencia artificial en la Oficin de Política Científica y Tecnológica de la Casa Blanca.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Trabajadora de Target le salvó la vida a cliente de manera insólita: esta es la INCREÍBLE historia]\nKrishnan, quien es un estrecho colaborador del multimillonario tecnológico de Elon Musk, recurrió recientemente a X para expresar sus puntos de vista, mencionando que: \"Cualquier cosa que elimine los topes por país para las tarjetas verdes / desbloquee la inmigración calificada sería enorme\".\nCuando un usuario preguntó si eliminar los topes por país puede ser contraproducente, Krishnan explicó la lógica diciendo \"necesitamos a los mejores, independientemente de dónde nacieron (otra peculiaridad extraña: el límite por país es donde naciste, ni siquiera la ciudadanía)\".\nPor qué la eliminación de los límites de países puede ser una buena\nDavid Sacks, el designado por Trump como \"Zar de la Inteligencia Artificial y las Criptografías de la Casa Blanca\", aclaró aún más la propuesta de Krishnan de eliminar los límites de países.\nEn una entrevista con X, comentó que: \"Punto de aclaración: Sriram no dijo que quiere eliminar todos los límites de las tarjetas verdes. Dijo que quiere eliminar los límites de países en las tarjetas verdes. En este momento, a todos los países del mundo se les asigna la misma cantidad de tarjetas verdes, sin importar cuántos solicitantes calificados tenga\".\nLos solicitantes indios enfrentan esperas de hasta 11 años para obtener una tarjeta verde, mientras que ciudadanos de otras naciones pueden recibirla de manera más expedita\", agregó. \"Sriram aboga por un sistema de inmigración basado en las habilidades y el mérito, en lugar de uno ilimitado. Su visión coincide con la postura conservadora de priorizar a inmigrantes altamente calificados.\nElon Musk está de acuerdo con el CEO de Perplexity AI\nArvind Srinivas, el director ejecutivo de PErplexity AI, mencionó la importancia de centrarse en las personas cualificadas en lugar de en una representación equitativa de los países y agregó sobre la publicación de Sacks: “Exactamente. DOGE para la inmigración no significa más inmigración ni eliminar límites. Más bien, significa dejar entrar a las mejores personas en función de sus habilidades en lugar de intentar asegurarse de que todos los países sean igualmente importantes”.",
