    "text": "Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gives players a blast from the past as not only does fan favorite character Jason Hudson make a return, but Verdansk, the original Battle Royale map for Warzone , makes its long-awaited return to celebrate the game’s 5th birthday. Along with the inclusion of a brand-new Zombies map, this season is packed with new content. Among this content is a new Battle Pass with over 100 items to unlock. Before jumping headfirst into the new season, players will want to know what to expect in the new Battle Pass, so allow me to break it down! This guide will provide a full list of all the content in the Season 3 Battle Pass of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone .\nFull List of All Season 3 Battle Pass Content In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 of Black Ops 6 continues using the new Page System for its Battle Pass. This system was first implemented in Season 1 and sees the Pass divided into several pages. Each Page has several rewards, with each Page having at least 1 Free Tier reward, which will unlock even if you haven’t purchased any version of the premium Battle Pass. The Battle Pass starts with a single Page available, with each subsequent Page being unlocked after a certain number of items are claimed. Players will be able to use Battle Pass Tokens to unlock each item. If the Auto Unlock feature is enabled, items will be unlocked each time a Token is acquired in chronological order, similar to a class Battle Pass. If this feature is off, players can unlock items in any order as long as the Page is unlocked. One thing that does remain from the Sector’s system is the HVT reward. This high-tier item can be unlocked when players complete an entire Page and then use a Token.\nThe Black Ops 6 Season 3 Battle Pass also has a BlackCell version. This premium version of the Battle Pass must be bought with real money and not CoD Points. It gives those willing to buy a collection of exclusive rewards and everything else that comes with the regular Battle Pass. Upon buying the Battle Pass, players will get 1,100 CoD Points, 20 Tier Skips, an exclusive Operator, Finishing Move, and even a Clan Tag. With the BlackCell, there will also be unique Skins for every HVT Operator Skin and Weapon Blueprint. The BlackCell also comes with a single BlackCell Instant Page Unlock Token, which allows players to pick one locked Page and gain access to it without having to reach its requirements.\nBelow is the full list of every item available in the Season 3 Battle Pass for Black Ops 6 and Warzone broken down by Page:\nBlackCell Page: Unlocked instantly if BlackCell is purchased 10% XP Boost 1,100 CoD Points Emote: Martial Arts XM4 Weapon Blueprint: Energy Siphon Finishing Move: Goodest Boy BlackCell Clan Tag HVT- Operator: R0-Z3 Page 0 (Earned for Purchasing the Battle Pass): Battle Pass XP Bonus: 10% Boost to Battle Pass Progression Weapon Sticker: Day Ones Finishing Move: Package Received Saug Weapon Blueprint: Marbled HVT- Operator: Mace ( Mace BlackCell ) Page 1 (Instantly Unlocked): Spray: Tank Fire (Free Tier) Marine SP Weapon Blueprint: Trench Wrecker Emote: Juggler 1 Hour Double XP Token Hand Cannon Skin: Heavy Issue and Calling Card: Burning Obstacles Emblem: Jungle Warfare HVT- Feng 82 Weapon Blueprint: Conflict Victor ( Conflict Victor BlackCell ) Page 2 (Requires 3 items to be claimed): 100 CoD Points (Free Tier) Weapon Charm: Tagged Up Nuchaku Weapon Blueprint: Rebarchuck TR2 Weapon Blueprint: Old Timer 30-Minute Double Weapon XP Token Optic Reticle: Oval Cap and Gobblegum: 3x Free Fire HVT- Operator : Hudson( Hudson BlackCell ) Page 3 (Requires 7 items to be claimed): Ames 85 Weapon Blueprint: Most Wanted MVP Emblem: Hatchling Calling Card: Chopper Popper Weapon Sticker: Crowned 30-Minute Double XP Token (Free Tier) Spray: Woods Stance HVT- New Weapon: HDR Sniper Rifle Page 4 (Requires 11 items to be claimed): 1 Hour Double Weapon XP Token Combat Axe Skin: Severed Steel 100 CoD Points Cypher 091 Weapon Blueprint: Bandaged Weapon Charm: Quad Support (Free Tier) Calling Card: Engage Hostiles!

    "title": "Signing a workplace NDA keeps this sickness incurable and invisible",
    "text": "Let's be very clear about this.\nAmber Harrison was not sexually harassed at work. But when she left Channel Seven after an affair with her boss, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement.\nSo the disappearance of the Amber Harrison footage from\nFour Corners tells you everything you need to know about what happens to women who sign these documents. I'm no insider in this but I'm pretty sure that as soon as the ABC aired footage of Harrison, the threats to injunct rained down hard.\nHarrison was already subject to court orders from Seven. The threat of injunction would have been terrifying for Louise Milligan and the whole team. No wonder they ditched Harrison who must still be devastated about everything she's gone through.\nSilenced for life.\nFortunately for us,\nAnna Cody is now in charge. Cody marks her first year as Sex Discrimination Commissioner on September 4 and is travelling around the country on behalf of the Australian Human Rights Commission consulting with Australians on sexual harassment at work.\n\"We need to be very careful of silencing victims,\" she says. I think she means that we can't keep doing what we are doing because the pattern will repeat. It is repeating.\n\"It is unfair, not a compassionate response, not trauma-informed.\"\nRight now, it's an everyday occurrence that women sign documents giving away their rights to talk about what happened to them when their bosses felt them up, mocked their sexuality, asked unbelievably intrusive questions.\nThey are, as Harrison said in the promotional segment aired and then ditched by the ABC: \"Silenced for life.\"\nCody says there are so many options which would still make victims feel as if they had some control over their lives. Organisations could be named, systemic patterns of incidents at a workplace could be highlighted, if a victim who signed an NDA but still wants change.\n\"The overall aim is absolutely to stop sexual harassment. We know it's an endemic problem,\" she says.\nAnd while lawyers keep telling me how useful it is for victims to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and confidentiality agreements, here's what those signatures do - they make the sickness of workplace sexual harassment incurable and invisible. Cody says we need transparency and accountability in these matters so women can choose to work in workplaces that are safe.\n\"We need to have a very clear discussion about how they are used, when they are used and that does have to be absolutely negotiated in a way that ensures lawyers recognise that there are options involved.\"\nOptions? What do you mean? Cody surprises me by saying lawyers don't even know there are options. Then she says: \"You'd be aware of research from Sydney University?\"\nLook, it's a fact that I did this interview with Cody over the phone but I am pretty sure I heard a raised eyebrow. Truth is, I did not know that. But I did rush off to interview Sharmilla Bargon who reveals that in research she did with colleague Regina Featherstone, 75 per cent of sexual harassment lawyers (from a sample of 145) had never settled a matter without a strict non-disclosure agreement.\nBargon says even they were surprised - particularly since they did the research a full year after the\nRespect at Work guidelines were released. So we had #metoo and then we had #timesup - but the fact is time is not up for sexual harassers. We are continuing to have cover-up culture.\nAnd worse, the findings revealed that 30 per cent of lawyers working for the victims and 50 per cent of lawyers working for the perps or the organisation said lawyers don't advise NDAs are optional. The lawyers didn't interrogate their usage, they just rolled out what they'd used before.\n\"We were shocked at those numbers,\" says Bargon.\nSpeaking of horrific numbers, Cody has some which will frighten you if you have any interest at all in making Australia safer in the future.\nThe commission is interviewing Australians about what they understand to be sexual harassment. And you'd think after all the publicity about safety and consent, after all the curriculum reform, after all the advocacy, young people would know all about this.\n\"What's staring us in the face is the lack of knowledge among young people, about what is sexual harassment, what their rights are,\" says Cody.\nThis depresses me. I tell her that it always irritates me when girls don't stand up for themselves in conversations about these matters. And she politely implies I've got a bit of internalised misogyny right there (as in, don't blame the victim). Which is a very good point although that doesn't make me any less grumpy.\nCody on the other hand is optimistic about the future for our daughters and our granddaughters, our sons and our grandsons.\n\"I do think there have been changes. There is at least an awareness within leadership of their responsibilities.\n\"Yes, there are absolutely further measures that need to be taken to ensure that work places are safer. But there is greater diversity within boards, and most organisations are training on these issues.\"\nREAD MORE:\nSpeaking of training, what advice does she have for the human resources sector who, in the experience of so many who've experienced harassment at work, do nothing more than back the bosses, reinforce the crappy values and do nothing to support the victims?\nThey need to take a compassionate and rigorous approach to anyone who comes to them having experienced sexual harassment, a rigorous approach to investigating it and ensuring that they have in place all of the policies all of the approaches which ensure that sexual harassment is eradicated in their organisation.\"\nAnd she reminds me that we now have in place positive duty legislation in this country, where employers have to ensure a safe workplace.\nYep, she's right. We were in a better place than we were 40 years ago but not the best place, nor the safest place, yet. Many of us are still silenced for life.\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",

A photo released by local media earlier showed a man inside the factory whose face was covered with a Palestinian scarf and who was wearing what looked possibly like an explosive device. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 02-02-2024 04:00 IST | Created: 02-02-2024 04:00 IST Police detained an armed man who took staff hostage at a Procter & Gamble factory in northwestern Turkey on Thursday and rescued seven hostages, ending a protest against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, the local governor's office said. The Kocaeli governor's office said that the hostages were unharmed, adding that the operation to rescue them was launched after negotiations with the hostage-taker failed. \"Our security forces intervened and neutralised the suspect,\" the statement said, adding that he was an employee of the factory who \"wanted to draw attention to the ongoing occupation in Gaza.\" The hostage-taker entered the factory in Gebze industrial zone in Kocaeli province around 3 p.m. (1200 GMT), the Demiroren news agency said earlier, adding that police had then rushed to the scene and sought to persuade him to give himself up. The hostages were six men and a woman, media reports had said. A photo released by local media earlier showed a man inside the factory whose face was covered with a Palestinian scarf and who was wearing what looked possibly like an explosive device. Another photo from the scene showed the man holding a gun in one hand and making a 'V' sign with his other hand in front of a wall on which Turkish and Palestinian flags were painted with a script that reads: \"Gates will open. Either coffin rest or death for Gaza.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.) - READ MORE ON: - [Turkey](/news?tag=Turkey) - [Kocaeli](/news?tag=Kocaeli) - [Gaza](/news?tag=Gaza) - [Turkish](/news?tag=Turkish) - [Gebze](/news?tag=Gebze) - [Palestinian](/news?tag=Palestinian) - [Procter & Gamble](/news?tag=Procter+%26+Gamble) - [Israel](/news?tag=Israel) - [Demiroren](/news?tag=Demiroren) - [Gates](/news?tag=Gates) ALSO READ [UN: Palestinians are dying in hospitals as estimated 60,000 wounded overwhelm remaining doctors](/article/health/2779958-un-palestinians-are-dying-in-hospitals-as-estimated-60000-wounded-overwhelm-remaining-doctors) [Harsh Israeli rhetoric against Palestinians becomes central to South Africa's genocide case](/article/law-order/2780002-harsh-israeli-rhetoric-against-palestinians-becomes-central-to-south-africas-genocide-case) [Israel opposes establishment of Palestinian state as part of any post-war scenario: Netanyahu tells US](/article/international/2781177-israel-opposes-establishment-of-palestinian-state-as-part-of-any-post-war-scenario-netanyahu-tells-us) [US says 'no way' to solve Israel security, Gaza war without Palestinian state](/article/law-order/2780988-us-says-no-way-to-solve-israel-security-gaza-war-without-palestinian-state) [UN: Palestinians are dying in hospitals as estimated 60,000 wounded overwhelm remaining doctors](/article/health/2780702-un-palestinians-are-dying-in-hospitals-as-estimated-60000-wounded-overwhelm-remaining-doctors)",
