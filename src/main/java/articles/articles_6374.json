    "text": "Milano, 8 ago. Alessia Pifferi, condannata all’ergastolo per l’omicidio volontario della figlia Diana di soli 18 mesi, lasciata morire di stenti nel luglio del 2022 a Milano, ha avuto un atteggiamento processuale valutato “negativamente” dai giudici della prima corte d’Assise di Milano, segnato da “un evidente tentativo di deresponsabilizzazione, condotto anche adducendo circostanze oggettivamente e scientemente false, sintomatico di carente rielaborazione critica del proprio agito omicidiario” si legge nelle motivazioni della sentenza del 13 maggio scorso.\n“Particolarmente significativo” viene ritenuto l’atteggiamento dell’imputata nei confronti del compagno, “in sostanza accusato di esser stato l’artefice ‘morale’ dell’accaduto: non perdeva occasione l’imputata, nel corso del suo esame dibattimentale, per sottolineare come lui non accettasse la presenza di Diana e come la bambina per lui fosse ‘un intralcio’, come proprio a seguito di un litigio con l’uomo, che l’aveva anche intimorita, avesse desistito dal proposito di rientrare a casa lunedì 18 luglio”. La realtà processuale è diversa e ai giudici mostra una donna capace di mentire e di lasciare sola, per quasi sei giorni, la figlia Diana.",

    "text": "The death toll, injuries, and disruption of business continued Thursday as protesters took to the streets of several towns to express their displeasure with President William Ruto’s government. The protesters said the president and his top officials should resign, adding that they had lost faith in his administration. Despite the heavy security deployment in several parts of the country and the [president’s decision](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497718/ruto-forced-to-eat-humble-pie-as-gen-z-protests-escalate) to send the controversial Finance Bill 2024 back to Parliament, protesters took to the streets of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Kisii, Kakamega, Migori and Kisii towns. However, there was uneasy calm in Eldoret, the president’s hometown, which witnessed a trail of destruction during Tuesday’s protests. On Thursday, four people were nursing gunshot wounds in Migori while the death toll in Mombasa rose to three as police countered protests with brutal force. In Mombasa, protesters and activists found two bodies with bullet wounds at Coast General Mortuary. Muslim for Human Rights (Muhuri) Rapid Response Officer Francis Auma said he saw two unidentified bodies lying at the Coast General and Referral Hospital morgue. But Coast Regional Police Commander George Seda said no one had died in the region as a result of the protests. “Nobody has died in Mombasa from gunshots,” said Seda. Businesses remained closed as police engaged the protestors in running battles in Mombasa’s city centre. The demonstrations, which started at 10am, involved several groups that had split up. The first group was in the town centre and the other at Saba Saba which went up to Buxton. This group was tear gassed after the demo turned violent at Buxton. Before the group in the town centre started the march, they gathered at Uhuru Garden along Moi Avenue, moved to the roundabout and to Likoni ferry, and followed Digo Road before going to Mwembe Tayari. They later returned the Mwembe Tayari to Treasury Square and were blocked from proceeding to the State Lodge on Mama Ngina Drive. In Migori, six people, among them two police officers, were injured as protesters engaged police in running battles. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Director for Medical Services Dr. Dan Ochiel said the injured police officers had been treated and discharged. “We have received six patients from the demonstrations where four have gunshot wounds. Two police officers were hit with stones on the leg and face,” Dr. Ochiel said. Two of the injured civilians were treated and discharged while two were taken to theatre for surgery. Protestors who came out in large numbers engaged protestors in running battles as they threw stones at the law enforcers. They blocked the Migori-Rongo highway with rocks and lit bonfires. Police officers lobbed teargas canisters at the protesters in a bid to stop the demos that started as early as 5am. At some point, the police ran out of teargas canisters and fired at the protestors with live ammunition. Similar protests were witnessed in Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia and Kisii towns, where businesses were paralyzed for most of the day. In Kakamega, youths engaged police officers in a running battles in Amalemba and Shirere estates. The youths also protested against the death of two people who were allegedly shot by the police. The demonstrations commenced at Muliro Gardens and proceeded along the Kakamega-Webuye Highway to Masinde Muliro University, then returned to the Kakamega County headquarters, moved to the Kakamega County funeral parlor to view the bodies of the two demonstrators before engaging police in a running battles at Amalemba estate. Normalcy resumed in most towns in Rift Valley and the Mt Kenya region, amid anxiety and heavy security. Embu Town remained calm unlike Tuesday when there were violent protests that involved arson attacks on the county headquarters and UDA offices. On Thursday, there was heavy police deployment outside the County Governor’s office, which was vandalised and set on fire on Tuesday. Police officers in uniform and plain clothes patrolled the streets as others kept vigil at strategic places. More officers were also positioned outside shopping areas and the number of officers manned key government installations and businesses. In Nyeri Town, a peaceful gathering at Whispers Park took an unexpected turn when police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Most businesses in the town remained closed while there was heavy police presence on most streets and residential areas. By afternoon, normalcy had been restored with a few traders opening their shops. In Murang’a, most supermarkets remained closed. In Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County, there was heavy deployment of armed security personnel at strategic points, particularly in areas where protesters gathered on Tuesday. And in the afternoon, a crowd poured into the streets singing cultural songs and denouncing protests in the town. Businesses resumed as usual with the majority of the businesses open. Public transport along the major roads was uninterrupted. “The president responded well to the issues raised by the protesters and as residents of Eldoret, we stand with him,” said Benjamin Leting, a resident. In Kisumu, residents accused the police of looting goods, including fish from traders. This came hours after protesters had marched to State Lodge but did not gain entry. They engaged police officers in running battles for several hours.

He said Maine’s northern lights are due to a huge outburst of solar activity. \"When we do get these big flares, they can make those northern lights visible even farther south, and so basically our entire state was in an aurora oval last night if you will,\" Laatsch said. The farther north you go, the better chance you have of seeing the northern lights. But this time, they could be seen much farther south, even in parts of Texas. \"Normally, of course, you have to be very far north to see these, so places like Iceland, Sweden, northern Canada get them quite often but for it to come this far, of course, we need a really significant amount of solar particles that have traveled and are impacting our atmosphere,\" Laatsch said. And Mainers might have another chance to witness the northern lights again tonight.

    "text": "换电池比买车贵？“宁德时代们”下场寻突破，新能源后市场开启万亿蛋糕争夺战\n（来源：每日经济新闻）\n“二手车残值16万元，换电池22万元！”随着新能源汽车保有量的提高，类似“换电池比买车还贵”的新闻已不鲜见。\n根据中保研发布的汽车零整比体系指标研究成果，在59款纯电新能源车;)型中，动力电池包单件零整比均值为50.96%。在售后维修中，一辆20万元的新能源汽车，动力电池包的更换价格超过10万元。\n“动力电池占据整车40%~50%的零整比价值，是售后服务、保险理赔、技术维修等的重点，所以受关注度较高。”科波拉汽车咨询服务（青岛）有限公司创始人王浩向《每日经济新闻》记者解释了电池维修“天价”的重要原因之一。\n价格之外，电池本身非常复杂，是涉及机械、物理、化学、电化学多学科融合的产品，技术门槛颇高。为了解决电池维修难题，宁德时代;)等电池制造商开始布局，途虎养车、天猫养车等第三方汽车后市场服务商也在争取三电维修的授权。一场围绕汽车后市场的新蓝海争夺战正在悄然进行。\n电池维修陷“天价”困局\n“某9万元车型底盘损伤，其维修费12万元，已经是车价的1.3倍还多。”上海一家汽修店的工作人员向记者谈到了新能源车电池维修贵的情况。\n对此，宁德时代质量体系及后市场业务部总裁李伟在接受记者采访时表示，“这种情况是有一定道理的。比如，这个电池包的产线已经切掉了，现在要生产这个电池包就需要重新切一条产线过来，成本就会很高。正常来讲，售后电池包的生产成本是正常量产成本的3倍”。\n而随着市场对动力电池体积能量密度的要求越来越高，导致CTP（Cell to Pack，无模组动力电池包）的装车量大幅提升。CTP集成度高，电池返修难度加大，一旦出现问题可能就要整组更换，电池包常陷入“只换不修”的维保困局。\n针对车主痛点，主机厂常推出“八年质保服务”。不过，这些服务往往有诸多限制条件，比如对车辆使用频次、售后场景等有要求，且只针对首任车主。\n据李伟透露，宁家服务（宁德时代后市场品牌）的返修中心就是针对一些“保外”场景开展业务。据记者了解，宁家服务是宁德时代此前推出的独立后市场品牌，可以提供电池检测、电池维保、二手车交易、电池回收再利用以及CTP返修和电池回收服务。\n宁家服务上海直营体验中心工程师表示，电池包来到返修中心都会先做检测，结合检测结果制定返修方案。原来换一个电池包要十几万元，但是通过返修方案可能只有这一价格的十分之一。\n李伟认为，电池维修的费用未来将会越来越低。“随着渠道越来越多，维修相关场景可以标准化，标准化之后成本一定会下降。”李伟说。\n售后服务授权难题待解\n技术难题之外，更重要的是“授权”带来的问题。毕竟动力电池属于车辆关键零部件，与传统燃油车后市场不同，新能源汽车的维修相对封闭和集中，多为主机厂的官方售后。\n“因为目前新能源汽车的动力电池维修量不多，所以是主机厂在国内适度布局售后网络。每个地级城市有那么1~3家就足够满足目前需求。”王浩说。\n记者了解到，目前主机厂具备新能源维修资质的4S店网点少，且集中于城市，县域覆盖薄弱。有行业人士透露，以某第三方汽车后市场服务平台为例，其养工店覆盖1700个县域，但具备三电维修能力的门店仅覆盖73城。\n上述上海汽修店的工作人员就告诉记者，其门店确实有一些主机厂授权的新能源车的维保业务，但是钣喷等业务比较多，三电系统的维修较少。而另外一家汽修店的修理工则直接表示，涉及到新能源汽车的三电系统是修不了的，需要维修还是得去品牌的4S店。\n“主机厂常对用户提供短则5~6年，长则8年或终身的质保政策，因而一般也连带着动力电池厂商必须提供同等期限三包，用户服务这块，零部件厂商已经成为履行质保约定的主要角色。”王浩解释称，如果不是零部件厂商和主机厂授权的服务商，一般达不到厂家要求的标准，也很难获取相应的零配件及技术支持。但是主机厂和电池厂家的售后服务授权，一般都不会大面积开放，只有少数维修企业能拿到。\n在此背景下，李伟也向记者谈到了宁德时代布局宁家服务的原因。“因为电池本来就是宁德时代生产、供应的，主机厂的电池出了问题，来找我们做售后属于原厂售后。”李伟说，“截至目前，搭载宁德时代电池的新能源车已经接近2000万辆，这么大体量的情况下，我们认为下场去做这件事的时机已经到了。”\n各路玩家争夺万亿市场蛋糕\n尽管挑战诸多，但随着新能源车逐步进入售后高峰期，大量“脱保”车辆即将涌入后市场，这一蓝海市场依旧吸引着各路玩家入局探索。\n赛迪顾问;)报告显示，2024年中国新能源;)汽车后市场总规模超过1.9万亿元，预计2027年新能源汽车后市场规模将突破3.9万亿元，平均年增速达25%。\n除了市场井喷外，国家和行业政策也驱动新能源后市场快速升级。2025年3月，《新能源汽车运行安全性能检验规程》正式实施，首次将三电系统纳入年检范畴，催生检测需求。同年实施的《新能源汽车维修维护技术要求》和《动力蓄电池维修竣工出厂技术条件》，也积极明确了三电维修流程与安全标准，以解决行业“不敢修、不会修”的问题。\n“新能源汽车维修确实是专业的需要先进技术、海量数据及丰富案例。目前，新能源后市场的锂离子电池维修、检测等相关的所有标准体系构建，宁德时代也参与其中。比如，宁德时代正在与国家相关机构标准化主管单位一起在做电池再制造的标准。”李伟说。\n除此之外，李伟还透露，宁家服务在和保险公司商谈电池托底、电池衰减、电池过保之后的再保、延保等业务，去联合开发更多适用于新能源汽车的保险。\n尽管裹挟着价格争议与授权壁垒，但政策支持与技术迭代仍会加速新能源后市场行业的发展。只有最终能在成本控制与服务效能间找到平衡点的玩家，才能在这场对万亿级市场的争夺战中站稳脚跟。",
