    "text": "New Delhi: During a visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan extended a helping hand by proposing to host a peace summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. Erdogan's call for dialogue and reconciliation aimed to bring the warring nations to the table in pursuit of lasting peace. “Since the beginning, we have contributed as much as we could toward ending the war through negotiations,\" Erdogan said. \"We are also ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also be included.” I am grateful to President @RTErdogan for his efforts to release our citizens from Russian captivity. Thanks to Türkiye's mediation, we have achieved significant humanitarian results. We are now counting on further efforts. Today, I submitted a list of our Ukrainian citizens,… pic.twitter.com\\/qFBW7AEDXh — Volodymyr Zelenskyy \\/ Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) March 8, 2024 In a press conference in Istanbul, Erdogan emphasised Turkey's commitment to mediating the conflict and expressed hope that Russia would embrace the opportunity for a peace summit on Turkish soil. However, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's stance on not engaging directly with Russia in peace talks, emphasising the need for negotiations to align with Ukraine's 10-point plan for peace. Zelenskyy's vision for peace negotiations includes crucial elements such as food security, territorial integrity, troop withdrawal, prisoner release, and accountability for aggression. He underscored the importance of a fair and just resolution that upholds Ukraine's sovereignty and rights.“Any proposals for settling this war must start with the formula proposed by the state defending its land and its people,” he said. “We want a fair peace.” During his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy also discussed defense projects and trade collaborations, highlighting the strengthening of bilateral ties between the two nations. Erdogan reaffirmed Turkey's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence, underscoring the strategic partnership between the two countries. As the conflict in Ukraine escalates, with Russian forces advancing into Ukrainian territory, the need for international support and military aid becomes increasingly urgent. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba emphasised the necessity of unrestricted weapon supplies to ensure Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression and prevent further escalation of the conflict. “If things continue as they currently happen, it's not going to end well for all of us,” Kuleba said. \"What is required is an unrestricted and timely supply of all types of weapons and ammunition to ensure that Ukraine beats Russia and the war in Europe does not spill over.”",

    "text": "Poor weather has repeatedly delayed the pollution-abatement operation for the wreck of the New Zealand naval survey ship HMNZS Manawanui , which grounded and sank off Samoa in October 2024, and New Zealand's representatives have declined to update local media on the amount of fuel left in her tanks.\nAfter the sinking, New Zealand's defense department initially said that Manawanui contained about one million liters of fuel in her tanks, and maintains that minimal amounts leaked out after the sinking. After several rounds of dive operations, a commercial contractor has recovered an estimated 340,000 liters of petroleum, the service confirmed to New Zealand outlet Stuff - but officials declined to say how much fuel remains on the ship.\nThe task was supposed to finish in January, but has taken longer than expected. The salvor continues to work on recovering remaining amounts of fuel from the vessel's tanks and compartments; conditions on scene are challenging, including periods of rough weather and a difficult location at the edge of the reef.\nThe ship will likely remain in place and become a part of the reef structure, New Zealand defense minister Judith Collins told local media. Despite local complaints about the smell of diesel fuel, the government of Samoa \"has decided it wants it to stay where it is,\" she said. Collins suggested that it will likely be a diving attraction when cleanup operations are completed, much like an artificial reef.\nHMNZS Manawanui went aground near a reef on the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa on October 5. The commanding officer ordered the 75 crewmembers aboard the vessel to abandon ship, and all made it safely to shore, despite rough surface conditions. Several of the survivors were injured while crossing a reef to reach safety, but all survived; the vessel caught fire and sank the next morning.\nManawanui will not be replaced, Collins confirmed in January, and her missions will be picked up by the patrol boat HMNZS Otago - a much smaller vessel lacking Manawanui's working deck and 100-tonne crane.",

    "text": "Posted On: Dec 28, 2023\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) customers can now leverage EC2 security groups to secure applications in clusters using Internet Protocol version 6(IPv6) address space.\nToday, EKS supports IPv6 enabling customers to scale containerized applications on Kubernetes beyond limits of private IPv4 address space. Kubernetes cluster administrators often have to operate in environments where IPv6 and IPv4 networks coexist. Until today, they could use network security rules that span pod to pod and pod to external Amazon Web Services service traffic defined in a single place with EC2 security groups, and applied to individual pods in IPv4 clusters. With this launch, customers can apply EC2 security groups for pods in both IPv4 and IPv6 clusters. Together with support for Amazon VPC CNI\nnetwork policies customers have an option for controlling network traffic within the cluster, while using security groups to control access to Amazon Web Services resources such as Amazon RDS outside the cluster.\nSupport for assigning security groups to IPv6 pods is available for most AWS Nitro based instances launched with new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.25 and above.

    "title": "Two beluga whales evacuated from Ukraine arrive in Spain",
    "text": "(CNN) — Two beluga whales have been rescued from the besieged city of Kharkiv in Ukraine and taken to an aquarium in Valencia, Spain, in a complex operation. A multinational team involving marine mammal care experts from Oceanogràfic de Valencia, the largest oceanarium in Europe; Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta; and SeaWorld were involved in the high-risk journey. The pair of belugas – a 15-year-old male named Plombir and a 14-year-old female called Miranda – arrived in “delicate health” Tuesday evening after a “grueling journey,” according to Georgia Aquarium. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city, which sits near its border with Russia, has seen a spate of Russian attacks in recent weeks. Last month, a Russian strike on a megastore in the city killed 18 people, including a 12-year-old girl, regional officials said. “The city is facing increasing threat from artillery fire, which has intensified in recent weeks, with bombs dropping within a few hundred meters of the aquarium,” Georgia Aquarium said in a press release. The journey began Monday when the team first removed the whales from Ukraine’s NEMO Dolphinarium and drove them 12 hours from Kharkiv to Odesa. From there, they traveled to the border with Moldova, where EU officials arranged to speed up border control. A six-seater chartered plane awaited the rescue team in the Moldovan capital Chisinau to fly to Valencia, where they arrived Tuesday. “The belugas’ health and safety were our top priority, and these were challenging conditions, including rough roads, rising temperatures and the inherent risks of being in an active war zone,” said Keith Yip, an animal care specialist at SeaWorld. The pair are receiving specialized care for trauma from a team of “medical, nutritional, and behavioral experts” and two Ukrainian caregivers are staying with them for the first couple weeks to help with their transition and care.
