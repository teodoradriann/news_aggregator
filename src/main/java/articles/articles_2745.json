    "title": "Camp Grounds café to extend hours and enhance Tamworth nightlife | The Northern Daily Leader | Tamworth, NSW",
    "text": "Following a major win at the [Tamworth Quality Business Awards](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8755438/tamworth-quality-business-awards-lia-mahony-honoured/), Camp Grounds' head camper Matthew Bettwesworth says the sky's the limit for one of the city's favourite cafes. \"I felt really stoked, to win Excellence in Small Business for the second time in a row, it feels like the work we've done together during the move to the CBD's main street has really paid off and I'm so proud of our team,\" Mr Bettesworth said. Looking ahead, the small business owner has big plans for the future. First and foremost, he wants to use Camp Grounds' success to build up Tamworth's night life. \"Our biggest focus at the moment is extending our hours. We've been putting it off for a bit to see what we can do, but what we want is to host events and training in the evenings,\" Mr Bettesworth said. These events will include art nights, music nights, book launches, coffee training sessions, and more. \"Also we'll apply for a liquor license. That won't be the backbone of what we do, but that'll be something that supports our events,\" Mr Bettesworth said. \"Part of my background is in viticulture and wine-making, so I'd like to showcase progressive, new-world Australian wines, like modern lo-fi [few to no additives] and different stuff you don't often get to see out this way.\" But the counterculture cafe isn't moving away from its core ethos of \"coffee + smiles\", meaning no extra food options outside the occasional nibbles and finger foods. \"Food has never been a focus for us. There's a lot of great food places here in town that do what they do really well. Our focus has always been coffee,\" Mr Bettesworth says. Tamworth's coffee connoisseurs will be holding their breath for the extended hours. There's no official start date since Camp Grounds' plans are still in the early stages and will need approval from Tamworth council. Mr Bettesworth says ideally he'd like to tick all his boxes by next year's country music festival, but much like a fine wine he says these things can't be rushed. The popular cafe [announced plans to move from Dowe Street in May last year](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8198122/happy-campers-popular-local-cafes-compass-points-to-peel-street/) and opened its new location at 322 Peel Street the following November. \"One of the biggest fears we had with the larger venue was there's more dine-ins, so how were we going to get around that grab-and-go culture we created in our first four years?\" Mr Bettesworth said. The answer, he says, hinged on updating the cafe's vibe from a '60s industrial aesthetic to more of a '90s \"Australiana regional-style camping\" culture. Another challenge was fitting out the new space, which Mr Bettesworth says was done by the sweat of his own brow, completing \"about 80 per cent\" of the renovation himself. The response from customers has been positive, and the cafe is hardly ever empty.",

Ein 54-Jähriger fuhr kurz nach 17 Uhr mit seinem Citybike auf dem Radweg der Franz-Greiter-Promenade stadtauswärts, hinter ihm fuhr ein 35-Jähriger mit seinem Rennrad. Auf Höhe der Hungerburgbahn-Station Löwenhaus wollte der 54-Jährige nach links abbiegen – gerade, als der Rennradfahrer ihn überholen wollte. Es kam zur Kollision. Der 35-Jährige stürzte und überschlug sich, der 54-Jährige kippte mit dem Rad um.\nErsterer wurde mit Verletzungen an der Schulter und am Ellbogen in die Klinik gebracht, der Lenker des Citybikes blieb unverletzt.

A heat advisory will be in effect from 10 a.m. Thursday through 8 p.m. Friday, with heat index values between 98 and 103 degrees expected. The Philadelphia region is facing another summer heat wave. A heat advisory will be in effect from 10 a.m. Thursday through 8 p.m. Friday, with heat index values between 98 and 103 degrees expected. Hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat illnesses, the National Weather Service said. Philly, suburbs under Code Orange due to poor air qualityPennsylvania officials on Wednesday declared a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for Ozone for the Philly region on Thursday. That includes Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties. The state Department of Environmental Protection cited mostly sunny skies, high temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s and light southwest winds as likely contributors to 8-hour average concentrations of ground-level ozone in the Code Orange range. Ozone is formed from burning fossil fuels. Cars, trucks, power plants and industrial facilities contribute nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds which, when combined with sunlight, create smog, also known as ground-level ozone. Under a Code Orange, air pollution concentrations may be unhealthy for vulnerable groups such as children, people with asthma, people with heart or lung disease and older adults. Residents and businesses are also encouraged to reduce ozone air pollution by driving less, limiting engine idling and conserving electricity by setting air conditioning to a higher temperature and turning off lights not in use.
