    "text": "Dec 10, 2023; Paradise, Nevada, USA; Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson (18) warms up before a game against the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Jaren Hall in the fifth round of the NFL draft last April with the intention of never having to play him in a game this season. Kirk Cousins hadn’t missed a game because of injury in his first eight seasons as a starter and Nick Mullens was considered a capable backup.\nThat meant Hall would have the luxury of learning from coach Kevin O’Connell and two veterans without any pressure. Unfortunately, the Vikings’ quarterback plans for 2023 went out the window in late October and continue to be anything but settled as 2024 approaches.\nCousins suffered a season-ending Achilles’ injury on Oct. 29 in Green Bay and the 25-year-old Hall had to replace him because Mullens was on injured reserve with a back injury. Hall started the following week in Atlanta, completing 5-of-6 passes for 78 yards and rushing for 11 yards on two carries before being knocked in the first quarter because of a concussion.\nWhat followed has been a musical chairs of quarterbacks with the then-recently acquired Josh Dobbs replacing Hall before he was benched just over a month later in Las Vegas. Mullens took over for losses at Cincinnati and against Detroit but he was benched on Thursday as O’Connell turned back to Hall.\nThe Vikings are on the outside looking in the NFC playoff race with games against the Packers and at Detroit remaining. While Hall is being thrust into a difficult and pressure-filled situation, O’Connell is making the move because he can’t trust Dobbs or Mullens to protect the ball.\nDobbs threw five interceptions and lost three fumbles during the parts of five games. The mistake-prone Mullens was worse. He threw six interceptions, including four on Sunday, and fumbled twice. Both recovered by the Vikings but that didn’t excuse Mullens’ carelessness.\nO’Connell’s decision also is a sign that he knows exactly what Dobbs and Mullens can and can’t do, and, more importantly, he knows neither is likely to be back in Minnesota next season. Dobbs is a free agent and Mullens’ contract contains an “out” for 2024.\nHall was the starter at BYU in 2021 and ’22 and started 25 games with the Cougars during a collegiate career that began in 2018. He doesn’t have much NFL experience, but he’s older than many of his teammates, including standout wide receiver Justin Jefferson.\nThis assures nothing when it comes to how Hall will perform against an often-criticized Packers defense. I thought Mullens would be an upgrade over Dobbs but after watching his decision-making and weaker-than-expected arm, that evaluation proved to be erroneous.\nIt’s a long shot that Hall is going to lead the Vikings to two consecutive wins, or a playoff berth, but O’Connell is making the right call. He will get an opportunity to get a look at Hall in the present but also have an eye on the future. That’s more productive than continuing with the mistake-prone Mullens.\nJudd Zulgad is co-host of the Purple Daily Podcast and Mackey & Judd podcast at www.skornorth.com.\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Zulgad: Kevin O’Connell makes right call by benching struggling veteran for rookie Jaren Hall",

More content below\nChristmas is banned in North Korea , but that is not stopping a group of activists from sending messages of hope, faith and freedom to the people suffering under the dictatorship of Kim Jong Un .\nFlash drives celebrating the holiday, and including Bible readings, were launched into the Yellow Sea in bottles so that the currents will carry them to the shores of the North Korean peninsula.\n\"We should be doing everything we can to get information into North Korea by land, by sea and by air,\" says Suzanne Scholte , chair of the Washington, D.C.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition which sponsored the messages. The operation is part of the group's \"Operation Truth,\" which Scholte says, \"is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.\"\nThe group has conducted 17 launches of the bottles. Each bottle also contains enough rice to feed a family of four for a week, as well as a Bible on a flash drive and a U.S. $1 bill. Among those launching the messages were nine North Korean escapees who want to bring freedom to their homeland.\nNORTH KOREA REPORTEDLY PERSECUTES CHRISTIANS MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD: STUDY\nThe Washington, D.C.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition group has conducted 17 launches of bottles. Each one contains enough rice to feed a family of four for a week, as well as a Bible on a flash drive and a U.S. $1 bill.\nScholte's Christmas message that is included in the bottles says in part, \"Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born...Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus. IN fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many Christians who believed in Jesus that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them. He did all he could to kill the followers of Jesus Christ...\"\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe flash drives also contain North Korean music, changing the lyrics from worshiping Kim Jong Un to worshiping God. They also play K-Pop songs, the Books of Matthew and Mark, as well as recorded messages from several members of Congress touting freedom for the North Korean people. Among those who recorded messages were Senators Jim Risch and Tim Kaine, as well as Congressmen Michael McCaul and Gregory Meeks.\nMAN WHO FLED NORTH KOREA FOR AMERICA RETURNS TO FEED STARVING CITIZENS: 'GOD CALLED ME'\nFlash drives celebrating the holiday, including Bible readings, were launched into the Yellow Sea in bottles so that the currents could carry them to the shores of the North Korean peninsula.\nThe North Korean Freedom Coalition started the outreach in 2022. It also has sent 600 shortwave radios with ear buds into the kingdom. During the summer, they started a program for Americans to order items that could be delivered to North Korea.\nScholte said that an increasing number of North Koreans are learning about the outside world because of the efforts of her group.\n\"We must communicate to the people in power in Pyongyang that they have friends and allies in Korea and America, who have only one desire for them: to share with the benefits of a free people, to give them a life of home instead of despair,\" she said.\n\"Those in leadership positions in the DPRK regime wake up in the morning with only two choices in their lives: being slaves devoted to Kim Jong Un or death and their families' deaths. That is why so many began escaping -not just for food, but for freedom, for a better life.\"\nKIM JONG UN WEEPS AS HE CALLS ON NORTH KOREAN WOMEN TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN TO STEM BIRTH RATE DECLINE\nSuzanne Scholte's Christmas message that is included in the bottles says in part, \"Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born...Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus.\"\nScholte's group and the Defense Forum Foundation also help operate Free North Korea Radio, a station that broadcasts news and information into North Korea. Its director, Kim Song Min, escaped in 1997, and despite attempts by the dictatorship to jam its programming, the station has broadcast on shortwave and on the internet.\n\"I would like to express my gratitude to the Americans for standing with us to help us reach the people of North Korea with the truth about America and South Korea,\" he said.\n\"North Koreans are brainwashed from childhood to hate Americans as their enemy and believe that America occupies South Korea, making them live in misery while North Korea prospers as a paradise under the Kim dictatorship.\"\n'CHRISTMAS SERMON' BY AUTHOR C.S. LEWIS WARNED OF A WORLD THAT NO LONGER KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG\nThere is another message that the activists are delivering to the North Korean people, one bottle at a time.\nScholte said that message is what Americans cherish. \"The benefits of a free people, a life of hope instead of despair.\"\nAnother message that activists are delivering to North Koreans are what Americans cherish, \"the benefits of a free people, a life of hope instead of despair.\"\nFox News' Emily Robertson contributed to this report.\nOriginal article source: Kim Jong UN bans Christmas, but activists send gifts of Bibles, food and messages of hope\nView comments",

    "title": "Geo storm could hit TOMORROW, NASA warns",
    "text": "NASA predicts that a geomagnetic storm could hit Earth this week, like a blast from solar plasma rockets heading towards our planet.\nThe blast, known as coronal mass ejection (CME), erupted from the sun’s surface on Tuesday, and the space agency’s model warns it could trigger a geostorm that hits Earth on Friday.\nThe model shows this CME from Earth’s magnetosphere, the area around our planet that is dominated by a magnetic field.\nThis means that the chance of a geomagnetic storm is low. If one does hit, it would be a “minor” G1 storm – the lowest level of severity for these events.\nG1 storms can cause minor disruptions to power grids, satellites and radio communications.\nAt northern latitudes, the Northern Lights – a blinding natural light phenomenon – can be visible in the night sky.\nIt’s already been an unprecedented year for solar activity, which has increased in recent weeks as the sun approaches solar maximum.\nThis peak of activity officially began on October 15 and could continue into the coming year, experts say.\nA filament burst has sent a blast of solar plasma towards our planet. It is predicted to shine off Earth’s magnetic field, which could cause a small geostorm on November 1\nThe CME currently moving toward Earth was the result of a filament eruption at the sun’s southwestern edge that occurred around 7 a.m. ET on October 29, according to EarthSky .\nFilaments are cooler regions on the Sun’s surface that can become unstable and erupt suddenly, sometimes creating CMEs.\nAt the time of this eruption, a large coronal hole formed in the northeastern quadrant of the Sun.\nThis is an area where the corona – the outermost part of the Sun’s atmosphere – is much denser and cooler than the surrounding area.\nThey occur when the Sun’s magnetic field is exposed to interplanetary space, and this open configuration can generate strong solar winds.\nThis newly formed coronal hole is currently in a geo-effective position, meaning it faces Earth and can have an effect on our planet.\nThe combined effect of the solar winds and the CME’s lightning strike could cause “some interesting auroral activity” on Earth on November 1, according to EarthSky.\nAurora is created when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth’s magnetic field, decorating the night sky with vibrant curtains of green, pink, red, yellow, blue and violet.\nThe combined effect of the solar winds and the impact of the CME could cause ‘some interesting auroral activity’ on Earth, experts say\nThey are most commonly seen in the aurora zone, an area within 1,500 miles of the North Pole. Normally the lights can only be seen in areas such as Scandinavia, Alaska and Iceland.\nGeomagnetic storms can cause auroras to appear further south. Earlier this month, a G4 storm caused the Northern Lights to extend all the way to Florida.\nIt is unlikely that a G1 storm would cause the Northern Lights to extend far beyond the auroral zone. But sky watchers at northern latitudes could see some increased auroral activity Thursday evening.\nAnd there will be more chances to see this spectacle as the sun spends the coming year at solar maximum – the period during its eleven-year cycle when solar activity is at its peak.\nIn 2019, scientists predicted that solar maximum would begin around July 2025. But as the sun’s activity increased over the course of 2024, it became clear that this peak would come much sooner than expected, prompting experts to revise their prediction.\nIn a conference call with reporters on October 15, representatives from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced that the sun had reached its maximum solar period, according to EarthSky.\nThe sun has already emitted 41 X-class flares this year – the strongest type.\nAccording to spaceweather.com, that’s more than in the past nine years combined. In an average year, class X solar flares occur only about 10 times.\nSolar maximum could last at least another year, so we can expect many more intense solar flares, CMEs, and geomagnetic storms to hit our planet in 2025.",

    "text": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., as commander-in-chief, leads the celebration of the 88th anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Thursday, Dec. 21, 2023. Also present were AFP Chief Romeo Brawner Jr. and Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. PHOTOS BY MIKE ALQUINTO\nMORE Filipinos are dissatisfied with the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the latest survey conducted by Publicus Asia Inc. showed.\nThe Pahayag End of the Year survey, conducted from November 29 to December 4, showed a noteworthy shift in pro-administration sentiment, which declined from 50 percent in the third quarter to 46 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe polling firm said that anti-administration sentiment remained stable at 18 percent, while those adopting a neutral stance increased from 30 percent to 36 percent during the same period.\n“Economic concerns, including price inflation, joblessness, low wages, and a perceived lack of productivity, emerge as driving factors behind the changing political landscape,” Publicus Asia said in a statement.\n“These issues, left unaddressed by the administration, have prompted a notable migration of pro-administration voters towards neutrality,” it added.\nThe National Capital Region (NCR) witnessed a significant drop in pro-administration sentiment from 49 percent to 33 percent, while Mindanao and North-Central Luzon (NCL) showed declines of 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively.\n“Notably, neutral sentiments increased across regions, indicating a shift towards non-partisanship,” Publicus Asia said.\nThe polling firm added that anti-opposition sentiment has decreased from 40 percent to 32 percent, with a notable increase in neutral sentiments from 42 percent to 47 percent.\n“The Duterte effect persists, with the Opposition Party grappling with discreditation from the previous administration,” Publicus Asia said.\nRegionally, pro-opposition support remained relatively stable, experiencing marginal increases in the NCR, NCL and Mindanao.\n“Anti-opposition sentiment declined across all regions, showcasing a shift towards neutrality,” it added.\n“The proportion of Filipino voters adopting a neutral stance towards the opposition has notably increased in NCR, Visayas, and Mindanao,” Publicus Asia said.\nThe Pahayag 2023 End of the Year Survey was non-commissioned.\nThe poll was conducted using purposive sampling composed of 1,500 respondents randomly drawn from the market research panel of over 200,000 Filipinos maintained by the Singapore office of PureSpectrum.\nThe sample was restricted to registered Filipino voters maintained by PureSpectrum, a US-based panel marketplace with a multinational presence.",
