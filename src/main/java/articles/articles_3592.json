    "text": "Los fuertes vientos revivieron el incendio que se presentó en el cerro Quitasol, en el municipio de Bello, al norte de Medellín, lo que ya ha consumido alrededor de 70 hectáreas de bosque, según han indicado las autoridades locales. Lea: Así terminó el rescate de las cinco personas atrapadas en un cable aéreo en Caldas La conflagración había logrado ser controlada el pasado martes, pero sobre el medio día del miércoles 27 de diciembre se reavivaron las llamas que en las últimas 24 horas han avanzado rápidamente por el cerro. “Ha sido imposible controlarlo; ya que, la vegetación es bastante alta y tenemos unos pinos, también, bastante altos. Continuamos las operaciones. Hasta el momento no tenemos personas lesionadas y seguimos trabajando para poder mitigar el incendio”, indicó el comandante de bomberos voluntarios de Bello, capitán Nelson Zuluaica. A los trabajos que venían adelantando los bomberos de Bello, se le sumó el Batallón Pedro Nel Ospina, así como bomberos Copacabana, Itagüí, Sabaneta, guardabosques y Defensa Civil, de tal forma que el pasado miércoles había alrededor de 85 personas realizando trabajos de mitigación. Le puede interesar: Robaron al bajista de Iván Villazón alrededor de $4 millones en Valledupar Según la Dirección de Bomberos, para este jueves, 75 personas subieron al cerro Quitasol para continuar con la extinción del incendio, así como se sumaron la Fuerza Aérea Colombiana, la Unidad Nacional para la Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres y la Dirección Nacional de Bomberos. “La Dirección Nacional de Bomberos, por solicitud del Comandante del CBV de Bello-Antioquia, activó un contrato de horas-vuelo para apoyar el control y extinción del incendio forestal en el Cerro Quitasol. Coordinación efectiva con bomberos de la región y entidades del Sistema Nacional de Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres (Sngrd)”, indicó la dirección en redes sociales. Esta es la tercera emergencia que se presenta en el cerro Quitasol en la última semana. Las dos primeras se registraron el 23 y 26 de diciembre, y fueron controladas por las unidades de socorro. La tercera se deriva de la segunda emergencia y primeras hipótesis indican que habría sido provocado por tierreros.",

    "text": "Application Security\n,\nNext-Generation Technologies & Secure Development\nSnyk Lays Off Another 128 Staffers as Economic Woes Persist\nThird Round of Layoffs Comes 4 Months After Snyk Raised $196.5M on $7.4B ValuationSnyk has executed its third round of layoffs since June 2022, axing 128 workers amid projections of challenging market conditions persisting into early 2024.\nSee Also: Accelerating defense missions with a global data mesh\nThe Boston-based application security vendor revealed plans Thursday to reduce its more than 1,200-person staff by an estimated 11% - less than six months after laying off 198 people and less than 10 months after cutting 30 staffers. The workforce reduction comes just four months after Snyk closed a $196.5 million Series G funding round led by the Qatar Investment Authority at a $7.4 billion valuation (see: Snyk Raises $196.5M Weeks After Laying Off 14% of Workforce).\n\"We anticipated a tough start to 2023, but we were prepared to accelerate growth in the back half of the year,\" CEO Peter McKay wrote Thursday in a message to employees that was also posted to the company's blog. \"We now know that the challenging market conditions are likely to persist into early 2024, so we must once again adapt.\"\n'It's Crucial We Evolve Our Strategy'\nSnyk said the job cuts will primarily come from the company's go-to-market and corporate functions. McKay said the company wants to right-size its go-to-market organizations to tightly focus on customer success, particularly in the enterprise sector. This will require bringing new skill sets and enterprise expertise into Snyk's sales, R&D, customer experience, and partner and channel teams, McKay said.\nAs the company's client base evolves from early adopters to some of the world's largest, most complex organizations, Snyk needs to pivot from a transactional customer engagement to a more consultative approach that extends postsale, McKay said. Snyk's customers include large enterprises such as Comcast and CVS Health as well as technology vendors such as Citrix, Salesforce and Atlassian, the company said (see: Snyk CEO Peter McKay on Making Defense Easier for Developers).\n\"Developer security is more important than ever, and today, we remain the leader of this category we pioneered,\" McKay wrote. \"But, as the company in which we operate continues to quickly change, it's crucial we evolve our strategy to further our growth.\"\nSnyk has experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune since September 2021 when it became the second-most-valuable venture-backed security company in the world after completing a $530 million Series F funding round at an $8.5 billion valuation. McKay said at the time that the money should position Snyk to go public in late 2022 or early 2023 and allow the company to bring in top-tier public investors.\n\"We now know that the challenging market conditions are likely to persist into early 2024, so we must once again adapt.\"\n– Peter McKay, CEO, Snyk\nJust nine months later, Snyk conducted its first round of layoffs in an effort to become free cash flow positive by 2024. In conjunction with its second round of layoffs in October, McKay directed Snyk to cut spending on everything from brick-and-mortar offices to IT and subscription services and business travel. Cloud security leader Aner Mazur and top legal officer Karyn Smith left Snyk as part of those job cuts (see: Snyk Lays Off 198 Staffers Including Cloud Defense Leader).\nThe December 2022 cash infusion came at a cost. Snyk slashed its valuation by $1.1 billion - or 13% - to secure a nearly $200 million investment from Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. That deal makes Snyk the only cybersecurity vendor to publicly reduce its valuation in exchange for additional cash. Snyk is the first significant cyber deal for QIA, which also invested $375 million in Elon Musk's buy of Twitter.\n'It's Never Easy to Say Goodbye'\nDespite raising $1.1 billion over the past nine years, Snyk still faces a competitive market environment. Gartner in April named Snyk as a challenger in application security testing due to its completeness of vision, lagging mainstays such as Synopsys, Checkmarx and Veracode. Gartner said Snyk's offering lacked built-in functionality and didn't provide the setup and functionality that security professionals need (see: Synopsys, Checkmarx Top Gartner MQ for App Security Testing).\nThe company's estimated annual revenue of $106.5 million - or nearly $90,000 per employee - puts it ahead of smaller startups such as Invicti Security, Contrast Security and Sonatype but behind established rivals Veracode and Checkmarx, according to IT-Harvest. IT-Harvest gave Snyk a health rating of 28, trailing Sonatype but besting Veracode, Synopsys, Checkmarx, Contrast Security and Invicti Security.\nSnyk's headcount is already down nearly 15% from a peak of 1,421 workers in October 2022, according to IT-Harvest, and it is expected to tumble from 1,211 workers today to 1,083 employees once the latest round of layoffs is complete, giving Snyk its lowest headcount since January 2022. Snyk has 626 workers in the U.S., 317 workers in the U.K., 165 workers in Israel and 94 workers in Canada, IT-Harvest found.\n\"It’s never easy to say goodbye to Snykers and friends who have helped shape the foundation of our company, but I am confident that with these changes, Snyk is positioned to capitalize on the enormous opportunity in front of us,\" McKay wrote.\nSecurity layoffs since May 2022 have been concentrated at late-stage startups that had been expected to file for an initial public offering in the next few years. Aura, Cybereason, Deep Instinct, Lacework, Malwarebytes, OneTrust and Transmit Security have also announced job cuts over the past year. Snyk is the only cybersecurity vendor of any size to publicly disclose three rounds of layoffs since 2022.\nThe volume of layoffs in the security industry has slowed after a flurry of job cuts in late spring and early summer of last year as well as the start of new fiscal quarters in early October and early February. Only three cyber vendors have disclosed layoffs since early March. Zscaler axed 177 workers - or 3% of its workforce - in early March, and Absolute Software cut 40 people - or 5% of staffers - last week (see: Zscaler Lays Off 3% of Staff Amid Delays Closing Large Deals).",

    "text": "July 2024 didn’t just flood the fields and rivers of the Northeast Kingdom. It flooded the historical record books, the foundations of family homes, neighborhoods, communities and municipal infrastructure. Twice in one month, storms unleashed a level of damage typically measured in decades, not days — challenging not only local communities and emergency services, but the resilience of the NEK and its ability to recover.\nThe first disaster came on July 10 and 11. Heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl soaked a wide swath of Vermont, with a narrow band tracking from Addison County through Caledonia and into northern New Hampshire. As water collected along brooks and rivers, evacuations and rescues occurred across the Kingdom. A second flood event followed on July 30, even more focused and intense. In just a few overnight hours, some areas received more than 8 inches of rain — triggering flash floods that tore up neighborhoods and swept entire homes off their foundations.",

    "text": "Canada Soccer’s Men’s National Team, Ukraine, Côte d’Ivoire and New Zealand to go head-to-head as part of inaugural tournament.\nThis June, four men’s national soccer teams will go head-to-head in The Canadian Shield, a new four country international tournament to take place in Canada, celebrating the global game. The new tournament will also prepare the teams for the biggest tournament in the world, to be hosted in North America next summer with six of those matches to be held in Toronto.\nMatches will be held on June 7 and 10 at BMO Field, featuring the men’s national soccer teams for Canada, Ukraine, Côte d’Ivoire and New Zealand, and is being presented by MLSE, SPORTFIVE, and MIB Sport Agency.\n“Toronto is preparing to play host to the biggest sporting event in the world next summer, and with it, brings the opportunity to make history,” said Keith Pelley, President & CEO of MLSE. “The Canadian Shield will not only give the Canadian Men’s National Team a chance to prepare against some of the best competition in the world, but it continues to build the excitement for the city and the global fans here of the ‘beautiful game’. We are grateful to the partners who have helped us bring this tournament to life, including the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, and we look forward to welcoming the world-class teams from Ukraine, Côte d’Ivoire and New Zealand to our city in June.”\nThe Canadian Shield will take place over two days, June 7 and 10 during the summer FIFA window, with two double headers hosted at BMO Field and a tournament champion crowned. The matches featuring Canada (ranked 31st in the world), Ukraine (ranked 25th), Côte d’Ivoire (ranked 46th) and New Zealand (ranked 89th) will be sold as double headers, with tickets for each day giving access to both games. Full tournament ticket packs will go on sale to the general public on March 21st at 2 p.m. ET at BMOField.com.\nThe tournament will award three points for a win, one point for a draw and two points for a shootout win. All matches will have a winner and games will go directly to penalties after 90 minutes (plus injury time).\n“MIB Sport Agency and I, as a proud Canadian, are honored to have contributed to making this global event a reality, said Bamdad Mirzaei, FIFA Match Agent, MIB Sport Agency. “This tournament will bring together four top teams from four different continents, serving as a thrilling preview of the next World Cup, which will also take place partly on Canadian soil.”\nSchedule:\n- June 7: Canada vs. Ukraine – 3:30 p.m.; New Zealand vs. Côte d’Ivoire – 7 p.m.\n- June 10: New Zealand vs. Ukraine – 5 p.m.; Canada vs. Côte d’Ivoire – 8:30 p.m.\n“We are thrilled to partner with MLSE to launch the inaugural Canadian Shield, bringing world-class soccer to Toronto at such a pivotal moment for the sport in Canada. As the country builds excitement for next year’s FIFA World Cup, this tournament marks the beginning of a new tradition, one that will showcase top international talent while giving teams crucial preparation for the global stage,” said Eduardo Borges, President Football Americas, SPORTFIVE. “We are proud to help bring this event to life and create an unforgettable experience for soccer fans across Canada and beyond.”\nInspired by Canada’s Coat of Arms, the Canadian Shield name and logo symbolizes the country’s enduring foundation and pride that unites nations together. The shield, a common badge of fandom and honour in the sport, paired with soccer elements integrated into the design celebrates both the heritage and spirit of the game.\n“We’re honoured to host the Canadian Shield Tournament right here in Ontario as we look forward to the World Cup coming to Canada in 2026,” said Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario.“Thistournamentwilladdtothealready- vibrant sports scene here in Toronto and across Ontario, and will showcase the incredible talent of our athletes and enthusiasm of our fans. I can’t wait to join them and cheer on Team Canada!”\n“Now more than ever, it’s important to come together as proud Canadians to cheer on our national team. Toronto is excited to host the Canadian Shield Tournament, with teams from Côte d’Ivoire, New Zealand and Ukraine for a friendly tournament this summer ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said Olivia Chow, Mayor of Toronto. “Sport brings us together and we look forward to welcoming the world to Toronto.”\nThis year’s Canadian Shield will mark the first of what will be an annual event, welcoming some of the best soccer nations in the world to BMO Field.\nTeam Quotes:\n“Every competitive match from now until the World Cup will be critical to get our team the preparation it needs ahead of welcoming the world next year. This is an extraordinary addition to our annual competitive calendar and to be able to play at home in front of our fans again will be really special for our guys.”\n- Jesse Marsch, MLS Canada Head Coach of the Men’s National Team\n“I sincerely appreciate the invitation from the Canadian Soccer Association. I am confident that these upcoming matches will be an important sporting and social event for both our nations. Ukrainian community in Canada has always supported our national team worldwide, and now it is our turn to visit them. Canada is a strong partner of Ukraine, and we are pleased to accept this invitation. In addition to the matches, we are also planning social and charitable initiatives.”\n– Andriy Shevchenko, President of the Ukrainian Association of Football\n“We have looked to put in place a program of games so that should we qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026 we will have faced a range of opponents in the buildup and both Côte d’Ivoire and Ukraine will provide a real test for us, which is exactly what we want. It will also be a great opportunity to be part of a tournament played in another one of the host countries to give us a taste of what we could face in 2026 if we win our qualification games this month.”\n- Darren Bazeley, New Zealand Football National Team Head Coach\n“I confirm the participation of the Côte d’Ivoire National Team, Current African Champions, in the tournament. This will be a great opportunity for the Elephants to compete against teams from different continents as part of their preparation for the 2026 World Cup. We are particularly eager to face the excellent Canadian team on its home soil in the beautiful city of Toronto. Wishing all teams a great tournament.”\n- Yacine Idriss Diallo, President of the Fédération Ivoirienne de Football\nPaulo Senra\nChief Communications & Content Officer, Canada Soccer\nEmail: psenra@canadasoccer.com\nMobile: (416) 882-7919",

    "text": "Nuevo misil hipersónico de Rusia: Lo que se sabe de esta arma que desafía a Occidente\nEl Oréshnik es indetectable para las defensas antiaéreas enemigas, según Vladimir Putin.\nPUBLICIDAD\nMoscú. El [nuevo misil balístico ruso Oréshnik](https://www.primerahora.com/noticias/mundo/notas/putin-dice-que-rusia-probo-un-nuevo-misil-de-alcance-intermedio-en-ataque-contra-ucrania/) (Avellano) con el que Rusia atacó el jueves territorio ucraniano es uno de los últimos ejemplos del armamento hipersónico de nueva generación desarrollado por la industria militar rusa.\nNi las autoridades ni la prensa había informado nunca antes sobre la existencia del Oréshnik, capaz de burlar cualquier escudo antimisiles occidental, según el presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin.\nEn su mensaje a la nación, Putin destacó que la velocidad que alcanza el nuevo misil es de “Mach 10″ o “2.5-3 kilómetros por segundo”, lo que le convierte en indetectable para las defensas antiaéreas enemigas.\nRelacionadas\nEl Oréshnik forma parte de los sistemas de armamento “sin parangón en el mundo” presentados en sociedad por Putin en 2018, en lo que muchos llamaron la nueva Guerra de las Galaxias entre Rusia y la OTAN.\nLos expertos rusos, que recuerdan que el Oréshnik puede portar ojivas nucleares, apuntan que el misil tiene un mínimo de seis cabezas de guiado individual.\nEl misil, de alcance medio, podría teóricamente golpear objetivos situados a incluso miles de kilómetros de distancia con un margen de error de apenas unas pocas decenas de metros.\nPutin justificó el lanzamiento “de prueba” -como lo definió-, aduciendo que Estados Unidos planea el despliegue de misiles de corto y medio alcance en territorio de Europa y la región de Asia Pacífico.\nRecordó que Estados Unidos cometió un error cuando decidió abandonar de manera unilateral en 2019 el tratado para la eliminación de misiles de corto y medio alcance.\nAdemás, advirtió que “en caso de escalada” Rusia responderá de manera “firme” y “simétrica”, y acusó a Estados Unidos de destruir el sistema internacional de seguridad y de conducir al mundo a un “conflicto global” al intentar por todos los medios mantener su hegemonía.",

    "text": "Toronto: A 41-year-old Indian-origin man has been arrested in connection with multiple robberies at Hindu temples in the Canadian province of Ontario in recent months, police said. Jagdish Pandher from Brampton is facing charges for numerous offences and is currently being held for a bail hearing, the Durham Regional Police said on Thursday. Investigators have linked Pandher to numerous break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year, most of which occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area. In a media release, police said that on October 8 at approximately 12:45 am its officers responded to reports of a break-and-enter in progress at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. A male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes, the release said, adding that he fled the area prior to police arrival. He was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax. “Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate,” Durham Regional Police said. At least six Hindu temples were reportedly robbed in the month of September and October alone, mostly in the Greater Toronto Area, which included the Chintpurni Temple in Brampton, Rameshwar Mandir in Caledon and the Hindu Heritage Centre in Mississauga. According to local media reports, last year, close to half-a-dozen Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area were reportedly robbed in a span of ten days. The Peel police in Toronto arrested three Canada-based Punjabi men in 2022 responsible for vandalism and theft in Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area from November 2021 until March 2022. Pandher was one of the three accused, which also included Gursharnjeet Dhindsa and Parminder Gill from Brampton. They were slapped with as many as 78 charges including Disguise with intent (13 counts each) and Break, enter and commit an indictable offence (13 counts each), according to media reports.",

    "title": "Revolutionary 'Smart' Immune Cells: A Game-Changer in Sustained Tumor",
    "text": "Imagine a future where battles against stubborn solid tumors are fought not with traditional therapies that often come with devastating side effects, but with engineered immune cells designed for precision targeting. Researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) have unveiled a pioneering advancement in cancer treatment: the EchoBack CAR T-cell. These cells are part of the ever-evolving field of cancer immunotherapy and represent a significant departure from conventional methods, offering hope for patients whose tumors have previously been considered untreatable.\nIn the world of cancer treatment, CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a beacon of innovation. Traditionally, this therapy involves extracting a patient’s T-cells, genetically modifying them, and reinfusing them to target cancer cells. However, the new EchoBack CAR T-cells are designed to operate with an unprecedented level of sustenance and efficiency. These engineered cells are activated by focused ultrasound, an adaptation that allows them to engage in sustained attacks on tumors for up to five days. This extended operational time is a significant improvement over earlier iterations of CAR T-cells, which typically function effectively for only 24 hours.\nThe promise of EchoBack CAR T-cells lies in their ability to navigate the complexities of solid tumors, which are notoriously challenging to treat with standard therapies. Traditional CAR T-cell therapies have shown remarkable success in blood cancers but have stumbled when it comes to solid tumors. This is due, in part, to the microenvironments that solid tumors create, which can suppress immune responses. However, the innovation encapsulated in the EchoBack technology provides a vital answer, allowing these T-cells not only to survive longer but also to operate more intelligently within the tumor landscape.\nOne of the remarkable features of the EchoBack CAR T-cells is their ability to be controlled remotely using focused ultrasound. This technique serves as an “on switch,” enabling physicians to selectively trigger the CAR T-cells in the presence of tumors. The targeted activation through ultrasound minimizes the potential for collateral damage to healthy tissues. Once activated, these T-cells employ a sophisticated mechanism that enables them to “listen” for signals emitted by cancer cells, enhancing their capacity to seek and destroy malignant cells.\nThe EchoBack technology relies on a unique feedback mechanism whereby T-cells are stimulated to produce additional molecules that enhance their killing abilities upon sensing the signals from dying tumors. This results in a powerful interaction between the CAR T-cells and the tumor microenvironment, leading to greater efficacy and a reduced risk of harming nearby healthy cells. Essentially, the EchoBack CAR T-cells exhibit a “smart” behavior that sets them apart from previous generations of CAR T-cells, as they are not only reacting to pre-programmed cues but are instead incorporating dynamic feedback from their surroundings.\nIn experimental mouse models, the implications of this research are profound. The research team demonstrated that the ultrasound-controllable EchoBack CAR T-cells outperformed conventional CAR T-cells in both attack duration and effectiveness. The difference in performance was significant, with the newer cells maintaining functionality and demonstrating less exhaustion when continuously exposed to tumor cells, contrary to their predecessors, which quickly became dysfunctional in similar scenarios.\nThis breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy brings with it a patient-friendly approach to treatment. Physical visits to healthcare facilities for T-cell infusions could be drastically reduced with the implementation of EchoBack CAR T-cells. Patients previously reliant on daily or multiple visits for treatments may instead experience the more convenient alternative of treatment sessions spaced weeks apart, drastically enhancing their quality of life during the battle against cancer.\nPeer-reviewed research published in the journal Cell details these findings and underscores the collaboration between researchers at USC and colleagues at Yale University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These partnerships reflect the integrative efforts to advance our understanding of immunology and cancer treatment. The A. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering at USC, led by Peter Yingxiao Wang, stands at the forefront of this exciting development, continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in biomedical engineering.\nLead author Longwei Liu, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, highlighted the revolutionary nature of their findings. “These CAR T-cells have never been developed previously,” Liu remarked. Not only do they provide robust and prolonged immune responses, but they are engineered in such a way that minimizes harm to normal tissues, making them exceptionally safe.\nThe implications of the EchoBack CAR T-cells extend beyond just one type of cancer. Researchers at USC have high hopes that this technology could be adapted and modularized for application in other solid tumors, including breast cancer and retinoblastoma. This adaptability suggests a future where cancer therapies can be personalized even further, effectively treating a broader spectrum of cancer types.\nWith the prospect of transforming cancer treatment landscapes looming ever closer, the continued research and development of EchoBack CAR T-cells could represent a watershed moment in the fight against cancer. As scientists strive to refine this technology and expand its applications, they offer renewed hope to patients who have faced limited options in the battle with aggressive cancers.\nIf successfully translated from laboratory experiments to clinical practice, the EchoBack CAR T-cells may not only revolutionize how solid tumors are treated but could also redefine the standard of care in oncology. The marriage between engineering and biomedical science is advancing at an unprecedented pace, and one can only speculate where this innovative trajectory will lead us in the future of cancer immunotherapy.\nSubject of Research : Animals\nArticle Title : Engineering sonogenetic EchoBack-CAR T cells\nNews Publication Date : 2-Apr-2025\nWeb References : Cell Journal\nReferences : Research conducted in collaboration with Yale University and the University of North Carolina.\nImage Credits : Longwei Liu at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering\nKeywords : Cancer immunotherapy, T cell development, Ultrasound, Cancer cells, Cancer treatments, Cancer research\nTags: cancer immunotherapy advancementsEchoBack CAR T-cellsengineered T-cells for tumor targetinglong-lasting CAR T-cell effectivenessnext-generation cancer treatmentsnovel approaches to solid tumor therapyovercoming untreatable tumors with immunotherapyprecision cancer treatment innovationssmart immune cellssustained tumor elimination strategiesultrasound-activated cancer therapyUSC cancer research breakthroughs",
