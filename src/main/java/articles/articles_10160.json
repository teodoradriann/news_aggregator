    "title": "India's Robust Strategy Against Lymphatic Filariasis",
    "text": "India is making significant strides in the fight against lymphatic filariasis (LF), a debilitating disease commonly known as elephantiasis. The disease, transmitted by the bite of a Culex mosquito that breeds in dirty or polluted water, is one of the world's leading causes of long-term disability. While not fatal, it significantly impairs quality of life, leading to severe physical debility and imposing substantial social and economic burdens on affected individuals, their families, and entire communities. The[ Indian government](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/government-boosts-rabi-crop-msp-2025-26-season-873404) has taken extensive measures to combat and control the disease, which is endemic to the country. A key strategy has been the implementation of a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign, launched nationwide in 2004. The campaign, aimed at controlling and eliminating neglected tropical diseases, achieved a remarkable 82.5 per cent coverage in 2023. It involves a door-to-door administration of preventive medications in endemic areas. Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a complex disease that has multifaceted social, environmental, and economic determinants. We cannot eliminate it by working in silos; it requires a collaborative effort from various sectors working together seamlessly, said Rajshree Das, Senior Director, PCI India. PCI works as a technical assistance partner to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. In March 2023, then Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya called for eliminating lymphatic filariasis three years ahead of the global target through a five-pronged roadmap by 2027. The global target is 2030. In August of the same year, the government launched the second phase of the bi-annual nationwide MDA campaign for lymphatic filariasis elimination. It targets 63 endemic districts in Bihar, Jharkhand, [Karnataka](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/karnataka-shocker-12-year-old-boy-swept-away-open-drain-haveri-amid-heavy-rains-873452), Odisha, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh. If LF is left untreated, it can progress to chronic symptoms including lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling) leading to disability. Lymphatic filariasis is the second most disabling disease in the world after leprosy. In India, till 2023, 6.19 lakh cases of lymphoedema and 1.26 lakh cases of hydrocele were reported from endemic districts, said Dr Aruna Sharma, a practitioner development economist and retired GOI secretary. Sharma, who has worked extensively on panchayat-level governance models and across ministries, also called for using technology and inclusive education to spread awareness about the disease to make a holistic approach towards disease elimination. Another major component of India's strategy to eliminate LF is Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP). India's MMDP strategy involves distributing MMDP kits for home-based morbidity management of lymphoedema, providing hydrocele surgeries in CHCs, district hospitals and medical colleges, as well as distributing disability certificates to eligible patients, Das said. These facilities are available free of cost. Frontline workers like ASHAs, community leaders, Women's Self-Help Groups, Schools, National Service Scheme, and civil society organisations have come together and worked tirelessly to mobilise communities and encourage participation in the MDA rounds. The fight against LF in India is reminiscent of the country's successful battle against polio. In both cases, the government has leveraged mass drug administration campaigns, community mobilisation, and public health workers to combat the diseases. The lessons learned from the polio eradication campaign have undoubtedly informed the current strategies being used to eliminate LF.",

    "text": "When freedom is under attack, oppressed people’s most powerful tool is often their voice and the voices of others. Brave individuals rise up and risk their safety and comfort to demand respect for human rights and speak truth to power every day. This panel features activists pushing back against authoritarian threats around the world. Dissidents living under repressive regimes have played crucial roles in the most consequential events in recent history. It would be impossible to tell the story of the fall of communism in the Eastern bloc and Soviet Union without speaking of the Czech playwright and future President Vaclav Havel or physicist Andrei Sakharov. Nor can the democratic transitions in East Asian countries on the frontlines of China’s aggression be recounted without speaking of South Korea’s Kim Dae-Jung, Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, or Peng Ming-min of Taiwan. Most democracy advocates abroad – even those critical of some American policies – express the hope that the United States continues to lead the free world in pressing for their freedom. They widely reject the notion that American support constitutes interference in their nations’ affairs or that U.S. advocacy on their behalf will make their lives worse. Supporting struggles for freedom around the world has become even more important as the world’s autocrats seek to undermine democracy and universal values through diplomacy, economic coercion, corruption, and sophisticated propaganda. It’s true that democracy is not perfect. Democratic victories don’t guarantee a future free from political and economic problems. Nascent democracies need U.S. and allied support even after the initial euphoria fades. Pashtana Durrani is an Afghan feminist, activist, and educator.

Be the first to know. Subscribe Officers from the Jinfeng District Public Security Bureau took Ma and three other believers into custody, issuing an administrative detention order against them the following day for the offense of “disrupting public order.”\nTwo men in the group were detained for seven days, while Ma and another Christian were held for 10 days at the Yinchuan Detention Center. Once Ma completed his administrative detention on Aug. 20, the Jinfeng Public Security Bureau placed him under criminal detention on suspicion of “organizing illegal gatherings.”\nCSW said Ma pleaded guilty during his trial to the charge of “organizing illegal gatherings,” which carries a more limited penalty compared to other charges.\nThe prosecution reportedly recommended a nine-month prison sentence, though no final verdict has been announced. The pastor’s family has expressed concern about potential long-term consequences if his nine-month sentence is confirmed.\nThe U.S.-based group China Aid said Ma became a Christian while studying at college and later began serving as a house church preacher in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Originally from Zhenxiong in Yunnan Province, he had visited another preacher’s family prior to his detention to offer support.\nShortly after Ma’s detention, his relatives released a public letter saying Christian gatherings do not constitute an unlawful activity and questioned the rationale behind the charges of disturbing social order.\nMultiple Christian groups in China have organized prayer efforts, requesting personal and spiritual support for Ma and his wife, Meihang.\n“The arrest and prosecution of Pastor Ma Yan is yet another instance of the Chinese Communist Party targeting ethnic and religious minorities and violating Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of religion or belief,” said CSW’s President Mervyn Thomas. “CSW calls on the authorities to release Ma immediately, and to declare him not guilty.”\nOpen Doors, which monitors Christian persecution globally, has said that the persecution of Christians in China is part of an expansive effort to control religious practice in China. This includes stringent regulations and enhanced digital surveillance specifically targeting unregistered “house churches.”",

    "text": "The decision by the United States to review the AUKUS submarine deal with two of its most faithful allies has rung alarm bells in Canberra, despite the claims from our leaders that we have nothing to fear.\nIn some ways, the review was inevitable. Last October, a US Congressional Research Service report showed America’s boat-building program was behind schedule and nowhere near able to supply the first of Australia’s AUKUS nuclear submarines on time.\nCredit: AFR\nThe US review is being carried out under President Donald Trump’s “America First” mantra and his nation’s ongoing political instability suggests Australia would be wise to conduct its own oversight.\nUnder the first pillar of the pact, Australia will buy three to five nuclear-powered submarines from the US, starting in the 2030s, and build more through a joint initiative with the US and UK. Under the second pillar, the three nations will collaborate on advanced defence technologies. Australia is also contributing at least $4.6 billion to the US defence industrial base to shore up submarine production; $800 million has already been paid . The deal was announced in 2021 under then prime minister Scott Morrison and then US president Joe Biden.\nTrump’s “America First” has distorted many accepted beliefs about alliances. The US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s intimidatory call for Australia to boost defence spending by tens of billions of dollars to 3.5 per cent of GDP in the near term was a clear trampling of sovereignty brushed aside by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nNow with Trump banging the drum loudly on China and Taiwan, the US review accentuates Australia’s sovereignty vulnerability in signing up to the trilateral security partnership that permits a US president to refuse to release the boats to Australia if it is required for American defence priorities.\nThe AUKUS partnership was built on a mutual strength, obligations and respect for sovereignty. The “America Alone” mindset, while playing big to some of the folks back home, has echoes of the 1930s that, if allowed to fully flower, will further weaken America as world admiration for its values fades.\nThe University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre found support for AUKUS’s second pillar funding and future translation of basic research into capability was nascent and unco-ordinated. Given such problems, it is entirely possible that the timing of the review announcement and Trump’s obsession with being seen to obtain the best deal in all circumstances are attempts to unbalance Albanese on the eve of their expected meeting at next week’s G7 summit, and gain Australian concessions.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles indicated there were no contingency plans should the AUKUS partnership sink. “Chopping and changing guarantees, you will never have the capability ... There is a plan here, we are sticking to it, and we’re going to deliver it,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\nMarles has a point. It is one of the reasons the submarine replacement program is now on the back foot. But it would be negligent to pretend everything is fine when it is clearly not.\nBevan Shields sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week. Sign up to receive his Note from the Editor .",

    "text": "Американский сенатор от штата Монтана Стив Дейнс заявил о том, что Россия \"наводнила рынок палладием\", что привело к снижению цен. Эксперт добавил, что в штате, где располагаются рудники горнодобывающей компании Sibanye-Stillwater, руководству пришлось уволить сотни рабочих. В связи с такой ситуацией заместитель государственного секретаря в Вашингтоне Майкл Ригас, который отвечает за вопросы менеджмента и ресурсов в администрации при президенте-республиканце Дональде Трампе, рассказал, что страна может ввести против Москвы дополнительные пошлины на палладий из России. Дипломат заметил, что решение связано с национальной безопасностью. Соответствующее заявление спикер сделал в ходе выступлении на слушаниях в профильном комитете по иностранным делам при Сенате.\nПохоже, что этот вопрос может быть связан с национальной безопасностью и требовать введения пошлин на важнейшие полезные ископаемые.\nМайкл Ригас, замгоссекретаря США\nСогласно информации от иностранного издания Newsweek, в 2024 году США импортировали цветные или не содержащие железо металлы из России на сумму 876,5 миллион долларов. Палладий остается ключевым компонентом каталитических конвертеров для автомобилей, а титан используется в разных сферах — от строительства самолетов до создания медицинских имплантатов. На долю \"Норникеля\" приходится 40 процентов от производства всего мирового палладия, по данным новостного агентства The Bloomberg.\nГосдеп понимает обеспокоенность России увеличением расходов НАТО на оборону.\nФото: YouTube / CNBC Television",

    "text": "Chivas intentó adquirir a Fidel Ambriz, mediocampista del Club León, pero su oferta fue rechazada. Pese al interés de los Rojiblancos en reforzar su mediocampo con el talentoso jugador de 21 años, no lograron concretar el fichaje. Chivas había propuesto una suma millonaria, sin embargo, el Club León mantenía una exigencia en 10 millones de dólares, y Ambriz prefería una oportunidad en el fútbol europeo.El futuro de Ambriz parecía inclinado hacia el viejo continente, pero no se concretaron las ofertas necesarias para que se concretara su salida. En cambio, el mediocampista se unió a los Rayados de Monterrey por una cantidad de 7.4 millones de dólares y firmó un contrato que lo vincula al club hasta junio de 2029. Esta situación representa una importante transacción para Monterrey, que asegura uno de los talentos más prometedores del fútbol mexicano.Rodrigo Camacho, periodista de Univision Colorado, reveló que Chivas hizo una oferta considerable por Ambriz, pero fue insuficiente para convencer al Club León y al propio jugador. La oferta de los Rojiblancos se asemejaba a la que finalmente aceptó Monterrey, cercana a los 7.5 millones de dólares, pero Ambriz optó por esperar una mejor oportunidad en el mercado europeo, cosa que no se concretó.El presidente de Club León, Jesús Martínez Murguía, mencionó que Ambriz recibió un acercamiento del Anderlecht de Bélgica, pero la oferta económica no fue suficiente para que se realizara la transferencia. Ahora, Monterrey ha establecido una cláusula de salida de aproximadamente 10 millones de dólares en caso de que un equipo europeo se interese en el mediocampista, lo que podría complicar su traslado a Europa en el futuro cercano.SV",

    "text": "Investigadores de Mayo Clinic recomiendan alternativas a la histerectomía para los fibromas uterinos, según un estudio\nROCHESTER, Minnesota — Los [fibromas uterinos](https://www.mayoclinic.org/es/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288) son una condición común que afecta hasta al 80% de las mujeres a lo largo de su vida. Casi la mitad de estas mujeres experimentarán síntomas que afectarán su calidad de vida y fertilidad, incluido dolor intenso y anemia. Los fibromas uterinos son la principal razón para realizar la extirpación del útero a través de la [histerectomía](https://www.mayoclinic.org/es/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/about/pac-20384559). Sin embargo, los investigadores de Mayo Clinic recomiendan alternativas de tratamiento mínimamente invasivas a la histerectomía en un artículo invitado sobre práctica clínica publicado en la [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp2309623).\nLos tratamientos menos invasivos pueden ayudar a las mujeres a recuperarse y reanudar sus actividades habituales con mayor rapidez. Además, muchos estudios han demostrado que hay beneficios para la salud al mantener el útero y los ovarios\", dice la [Dra. Shannon Laughlin-Tommaso](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/laughlin-tommaso-shannon-k-m-d/bio-00112295), obstetra-ginecóloga de Mayo Clinic y coautora principal del artículo.\nLa extirpación del útero, incluso preservando los ovarios, aumenta los riesgos de enfermedades cardiovasculares, depresión, ansiedad y una mayor tasa de mortalidad. Estos riesgos son mayores en personas que extirpan el útero cuando aún son jóvenes.\n\"Las mujeres que contemplan una histerectomía merecen orientación sobre estos riesgos, ya que existen otras opciones menos invasivas para muchas mujeres con fibromas\", dice la Dra. Laughlin-Tommaso.\nUn estudio reciente ha hallado que casi el 60% de las mujeres que se sometieron a la histerectomía para fibromas no habían recibido un tratamiento menos invasivo anteriormente. Tener opciones alternativas a la histerectomía permite a las mujeres mantener sus úteros por más tiempo.\nEstas alternativas incluyen [terapias médicas](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-treatment-for-uterine-fibroids-without-surgery/), dispositivos intrauterinos hormonales (DIUs), [ablación por radiofrecuencia](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-nonsurgical-treatment-for-uterine-fibroids/), ablación por ultrasonido focalizado y embolización de las arterias uterinas.\nLa detección temprana es clave. Cuando los fibromas se encuentran temprano, tienden a ser más pequeños y menos extensos. Como resultado, tratarlos temprano es clínicamente menos complicado.\nLa incidencia de fibromas aumenta con la edad hasta la menopausia y es mayor entre las mujeres negras. Además, esta población a menudo tiene fibromas más graves.\n\"El diagnóstico y el tratamiento temprano de los fibromas uterinos pueden ayudar a reducir esta disparidad de salud entre las mujeres negras\", explica la [Dra. Ebbie Stewart](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stewart-ebbie-a-m-d/bio-00095802), coautora principal y ginecóloga y endocrinóloga reproductiva en Mayo Clinic. En las [investigaciones basadas en encustas](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38610011/), muchas pacientes negras prefirieron terapias mínimamente invasivas en lugar de las histerectomías.\nEl diagnóstico de fibromas es bastante simple; se realiza a través de un ultrasonido pélvico, pero determinar quién debe someterse a un triaje no es tan fácil, y el triaje generalmente ocurre después de que los fibromas se agrandan o cuando las pacientes ya tienen los síntomas. Muchas mujeres con fibromas sintomáticos informaron angustia psicológica, como depresión, preocupación, ira y malestar con respecto a su imagen corporal.\nLos investigadores sugieren que los estudios futuros deberán incluir el triaje de mujeres más jóvenes, particularmente las de jóvenes negras, y de personas con una sólida historia familiar de fibromas para determinar si el tratamiento temprano reduce los riesgos a largo plazo.\n¿Por qué una histerectomía?\nLas histerectomías han sido el tratamiento más común para los fibromas uterinos por varias razones.\n\"La histerectomía facilita la toma de decisiones tanto para los prestadores de servicios de salud como para los pacientes. Para los prestadores, no es necesario determinar qué miomas deben ser tratados o extirpados. La histerectomía también está disponible universalmente en las prácticas de obstetricia y ginecología\", explica la Dra. Laughlin-Tommaso.\nAdemás, las preocupaciones sobre la falta inadvertida de un cáncer raro que crece en los músculos lisos del útero, conocido como leiomiosarcoma, han llevado a una mayor tasa de histerectomías con respecto a los enfoques menos invasivos.\nFinalmente, una de las principales razones por las que se realiza la histerectomía es que los fibromas pueden reaparecer aproximadamente el 50% de las veces dentro de los cinco años posteriores a su extirpación. Sin embargo, los investigadores señalan que no todos los fibromas nuevos se volverán sintomáticos, especialmente entre las mujeres que ingresan a la menopausia.\nRevise el [artículo](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp2309623) para obtener una lista completa de autores, divulgaciones y financiación.\n###\nInformación sobre Mayo Clinic[Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/es-es/departments-centers/international?mc_id=us&utm_source=newsnetwork&utm_medium=l&utm_content=content&utm_campaign=mayoclinic&geo=national&placementsite=enterprise&invsrc=other&cauid=100721) es una organización sin fines de lucro, dedicada a innovar la práctica clínica, la educación y la investigación, así como a ofrecer pericia, compasión y respuestas a todos los que necesitan recobrar la salud.

    "text": " Young voters prefer President Joe Biden over ex-President Donald Trump , according to a new poll .\nWhat Happened : Of the 2,010 participants surveyed by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, 45% of 18 to 29-year-olds prefer Biden, while 37% picked Trump.\nSixteen percent of respondents were undecided.\nOf those polled, 53% said they were definitely voting in the 2024 election. That’s on par with the same time period of the 2020 election poll.\nSee Also: GOP Mega Donor’s Son Throws Support Behind Incumbent President In Biden Vs. Trump Battle\nBiden's lead over Trump was significant in several categories, including:\nAges 18-29 (+14 points higher) Women (+33 points) College students (+23 points) College graduates (+47 points). Trump trails Biden by six points among male voters, which was better than the overall poll.\nThe poll also found that among respondents who would vote Trump, 76% said they enthusiastically support the candidate, compared to 44% strong support for people backing Biden.\nGiven the option of third-party and Independent candidates, voters chose:\nBiden: 28% Trump: 25% Robert F. Kennedy Jr. : 11% Jill Stein : 4% Cornel West: 3% Don't Know: 28% Related Link: Trump Vs. Biden – Former President Retakes Lead In 2024 Election Poll, Which Candidate Do Independent Voters Support?\nWhy It's Important : The poll, conducted from March 14 to March 21, came before the start of Trump's hush money criminal trial.\nThe survey asked young voters how a guilty verdict for Trump in any of his upcoming trials could impact their vote.\nBiden's lead grew from eight points to 18 points among all voters if Trump is found guilty.\nAmong young people likely to vote, Biden's lead grew from 19 points to 28 points if Trump is found guilty.\n Key issues for young voters are the economy, immigration and foreign policy. The survey found that only 9% of potential young voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. This compares to 21% who answered this in the spring 2020 election survey.\nOn the flip side, 58% of respondents said the country is off on the wrong track moving forward, which could be a worry for Biden's campaign.\n\"Young people today have clear concerns about where our country is headed,\" said IOP Director Setti Warren . \"From worries about the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and climate, young people across the country are paying attention and are increasingly prepared to make their voices heard at the ballot box this November.\"\nA recent poll from Morning Consult of registered voters aged 18 to 34 found a much closer race with Biden and Trump each getting 41% of the vote and the remaining picking \"Someone Else\" or \"Don't Know.\"\nAccording to Statista , 55% of voters aged 18-29 voted in the 2020 election, which marked a significant increase from the 44% who turned out for the 2016 election. The peak voter turnout for the youth was 55.4% in 1972.\nBiden won the 2020 election , while Trump won the 2016 election.\nYounger voters have often voted Democratic, with a Politico report saying the last Republican to win the youth vote was George H. W. Bush in 1988. Since that time, there have been eight presidential elections. Democrats won five of the eight last elections.\nIn an election expected to be close, the youth vote could be more important than ever in deciding the winner.\nRead Next: Trump Hush Money Trial Draws Reaction From Congressman, Talk Show Hosts: ‘Worse Than Anything Richard Nixon Ever Did’\nImage: Shutterstock\n Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2024 Benzinga.com.

E um dos assuntos, claro, foi a polêmica em torno de comentários de atletas da franquia sobre a segurança no Brasil. Primeiro a conversar com os jornalistas, ainda antes do treinamento, Sirianni tratou de colocar \"panos quentes\" e elogiar a forma como a equipe foi recebida em São Paulo.\n- Tudo está sendo muito bom, muita receptividade. As pessoas no hotel estão sendo muito legais. Sabemos o quão apaixonado este país é pelos esportes e estamos muito empolgados de estar aqui. Como jogamos na Filadélfia, devemos jogar da mesma maneira aqui. Existem questões como em qualquer outra cidade e devemos fazer o nosso trabalho, jogar um jogo de futebol americano. Esse é o único objetivo. É por isso que estamos aqui. Vamos tentar deixar as coisas o mais normais possíveis.

Em português, ele foi diplomático ao comentar a atitude de seus companheiros de equipe e assegurou que eles mudarão de opinião após a viagem.\n- Eu acho que as pessoas têm um pouquinho de medo do que eles não conhecem. Aqui é um país que muitos deles nunca visitaram, eles não falam o idioma, eles não conhecem nada sobre o Brasil. Eles sabem que gostam de futebol, que falam português e é isso. Então, eles têm um pouquinho de medo porque não sabem. Agora aqui, eles vão ver que o povo é ótimo, o povo é simpático. Eles vão ter experiência que vão mudar a visão deles. E não é porque eles não gostam do Brasil ou dos brasileiros, é só porque eles não conhecem - disse McKee.\nNFL 2024/2025: principais datas, favoritos e candidatos a MVP NFL tem relação de mais de 50 anos com Brasil e se aproxima do país há 30\n3 de 3 Saquon Barkley participa da atividade no gramado da Neo Química Arena nesta quinta — Foto: Adriano Albuquerque Saquon Barkley participa da atividade no gramado da Neo Química Arena nesta quinta — Foto: Adriano Albuquerque\nOs jogadores dos Eagles, em geral, demonstraram também gratidão em participar de um momento histórico, de estarem no primeiro jogo da NFL no Brasil. Jordan Mailata, offensive tackle nascido na Austrália, espera que a partida possa motivar mais jovens de fora dos EUA a praticarem o esporte e buscarem o sonho de jogar no nível mais alto.\n- O propósito de levar jogos internacionalmente é para inspirar. Eu era um desses meninos vendo highlights no Youtube, eu nem entendia o jogo, mas vendo esses jogos, pensei que poderia ter uma chance - comentou Mailata.\n- Se eu conseguir uma grande corrida, ou Jalen der um grande passe, alguma criança vai virar pro pai e pra mãe e dizer, \"Quero fazer isso\". Acho que é isso que importa - acrescentou o running back Saquon Barkley.\nCorinthians",

    "text": "A 77-year old woman was still in critical condition Thursday evening after being hit by a car on Wednesday night near Town Center. A spokesperson for the Virginia Beach Police Department said she was checking to provide additional updates on the woman, but News 3 has not heard back as of Thursday afternoon. The woman was in a crosswalk at the intersection of Virginia Beach Boulevard and Independence Boulevard, but did not have the right-of-way, the spokesperson said. Just up the road earlier this month, a pedestrian was hit and killed on Virginia Beach Boulevard. The city is working on its local road safety action plan, holding another meeting with the community in February to get more feedback. In interactive comments online, people are weighing in on the traffic in the area, including one person who said there's no efficient way to cross Independence Boulevard outside of the Virginia Beach Boulevard. In addition to the action plan, the city is getting nearly $15 million from the federal government to build a three-mile path from the border of Norfolk to Town Center along what was once land reserved for the light rail. News 3 spoke with people in the area about traffic. \"Pedestrian safety is something they should pay more attention to,\" said one person. \"As long as you follow the signs, the traffic will follow you fine,\" said another. Stay with News 3 as more updates about the crash continue to be made available. More stories from Virginia Beach",
