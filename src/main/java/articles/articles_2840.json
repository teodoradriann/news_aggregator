    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "- Courtesy\n- Donald Pleasant\nThis\n[\"Life Stories\"](/arts-culture/life-stories-remembering-vermonters-who-died-in-2024-42495346) profile is part of a collection of articles remembering Vermonters who died in 2024.\nIn his 44 years as a custodian at the Federal Building and Post Office in Burlington, Donald Pleasant only ever took a few days off. Every morning, he would bike the two blocks from his house to work, where he took out the trash and recycling, cleaned the floors, and handled landscaping and snow removal.\nAround the office, he gained a reputation for his punctuality and work ethic. Joe Perella, a retired assistant U.S. attorney, said Donald was the first person he talked to every day, and the custodian's calm demeanor was a steadying influence in what could be a stressful work environment. When Perella came in on Monday mornings, he recalled, Donald would offer encouragement: \"We can do it.\" And when Perella left on Friday afternoons, the custodian would say, \"We did it.\"\nDonald's workday officially began at 6 a.m., but he insisted on arriving even earlier — a habit that sometimes resulted in accidentally setting off the building's alarm, according to his boss, June Snyder.\nDonald biked to work no matter the weather. Twice, his bike was stolen. Each time, the office pooled money to buy him a new one.\n\"Everybody in the building just loved him,\" Snyder said. \"Because he was so focused on his job, he might not have even realized how many people cared about him and considered him a friend.\"\n[He might not have even realized how many people cared about him and considered him a friend. June Snyder tweet this](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A//www.sevendaysvt.com/arts-culture/obituary-donald-pleasant-of-vermont-1951-2024-42495790&text=He+might+not+have+even+realized+how+many+people+cared+about+him+and+considered+him+a+friend.+June+Snyder)\nCoworkers described Donald as an intensely focused person who was there to do a job, though he was sociable when others initiated. He took pride in being someone others could count on. If something was even slightly off schedule — say, someone was delayed in letting him into a secure area of the building — Donald would let everyone know.\n\"It gives me a purpose,\" Donald said of his job in a 2021 video after winning Goodwill Northern New England's Client of the Year Award in Cleaning. \"If I didn't have a job, I'd be like everybody else: out on the street, trying to make ends meet.\"\nDonald continued to work until about a week before he died of natural causes at the University of Vermont Medical Center on February 9. He was 72.\nRoutine was a lifeline for Donald, whose childhood was characterized by instability. Born in a rough Philadelphia neighborhood, he spent his earliest years raised by his single mother in a household with nine siblings from three different fathers. Perhaps as much for the structure it gave him as for the money, Donald always seemed to have a job, from shining shoes on the streets of Philly to shoveling snow, according to his brother Michael Hernandez.\n- Courtesy\n- From left: Heide and Richard DeNaples-Hilers with their own children and surrogate sons Donald Pleasant and Michael Hernandez\nMaking ends meet was a constant struggle for the family. When Donald was in elementary school, he, Michael and their brother Harold Pleasant started spending time at the home of neighbor Richard DeNaples-Hiler, a Quaker who worked for the American Friends Service Committee. He also became a surrogate parent to the three boys. Through that religious humanitarian group, Richard organized frequent trips to the Soviet Union. One summer he asked Heide Bredfeldt, a student at Hunter College in New York City whom he had met at a conference on racial discrimination, to care for them in Philadelphia while he was traveling.\nA few months after Richard returned, he and Heide married and moved to the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. They brought Donald and his brothers with them and had two children of their own. The arrangement was informal; the boys were never officially adopted or placed in a foster care system.\n- Courtesy\n- Donald at around 12 years old\nMoving from a Black community in the inner city to a predominantly white, affluent suburb was a culture shock for Donald and his siblings, who were Black and Latino. Heide, who is white, said their multiracial family stood out in the 1960s and recalled how the boys were once refused entry to a public restroom.\nSchool was also difficult for Donald. Heide said she realized the boy didn't know how to read when he was in the third grade, so she hired a private tutor.\nWhile Donald continued to struggle with academics, he developed a knack for hands-on tasks. He once built a scooter out of a crate and a roller skate, and he buried himself in magazines about mechanical systems.\nStill he had trouble adapting to his new life. Donald often ran away, attempting to return to Philadelphia, but each time, his mother sent him back.\n\"He did what he had to do to cope,\" Michael said. \"He was someone who was going to survive and just keep going.\"\nOnly 10 years older than Donald, Heide said she felt ill-equipped to care for the boys. So she and Richard sent Donald from household to household, hoping for a better fit. He spent a summer with a family in Syracuse, N.Y., and stayed in Atlanta with a relative of the far-left activist Angela Davis, who had attended one of Richard's trips to the Soviet Union. He briefly attended the Arthur Morgan School, a Quaker boarding school in Burnsville, N.C.\n\"We tried very hard to find a match for Donald,\" Heide told Seven Days. \"But somehow, it didn't click.\"\nThe details of Donald's early adulthood are largely unknown. He began drinking too much, and after Heide and Richard moved to Putney in 1968, they lost regular contact with him. None of Donald's family members who spoke with Seven Days could say how he ended up in Burlington.\nIn 1977, at age 26, Donald had a daughter, Amber Pleasant, with Rose Stautzenbach, a Barre nurse. Amber, who now lives in Austin, Texas, described Donald as a loving, if imperfect, father who tried his best — though his alcoholism often prevented him from being present for his daughter.\nDonald didn't have a car, so when he did visit Amber and her mom in Barre, he would hitchhike from Burlington.\n\"I remember asking him about that not too long ago: 'Why did you do that?'\" Amber recalled. \"He was like, 'No one was gonna stop me from seeing you if I wanted to see you.'\"\nIn 1980, Donald began working at the Federal Building and Post Office, where he found a sense of stability. He settled down and, in 1997, married Wendy Jones Pleasant of Burlington.\nIn his fifties, Donald suffered a serious injury while working. Attempting to unjam a snowblower, he put his hand inside the auger housing and lost three of his fingers. But Donald wasn't one to complain, and he returned to work shortly thereafter.\n\"This was a guy who was always Steady Eddie,\" Michael said. \"I think he would be the poster child for resilience.\"\nIn 2020 that resilience would be tested by tragedy when Wendy died suddenly in their Burlington home. Snyder, Donald's boss at the Federal Building, remembers getting a call from him at 4 a.m. about Wendy's death; she went over to the house to comfort him.\n\"I just kind of sat with him, took him for a walk for a bit, and he says, 'Well, I'll be in [to work],'\" Snyder recalled. \"I'm like, 'No, Don, you will definitely not be in.'\"\nThe office pooled money to cover Wendy's funeral expenses, and Snyder started helping Donald with tasks that Wendy had always taken care of, such as paying bills and grocery shopping.\n\"When my wife passed, it was really, really bad. But then the people [were] pouring in,\" Donald said in the 2021 video. \"You don't know how many people care until something like that happens.\"\nAmid the grief, something changed in Donald. With Snyder's encouragement, he quit drinking, a decision that amazed his family.\n\"It just astounds me,\" Amber said. \"He had that dependency for so long, and then, in the middle of the pandemic, [after] losing his wife, he just quit.\"\nWith his newfound sobriety, he reconnected with family members and built up a small nest egg with the money he no longer spent on liquor. He even took a bus to see his siblings in Philadelphia, where he proudly treated his family to Chinese food.\nDespite his hardships, Donald was never one for self-pity.\n\"Up and down, up and down, but pretty much up,\" he said in the 2021 video. \"I'm happy.\"",

    "text": "By Doina Chiacu and Hannah Lang WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on alleged Russian money laundering operations that catered to cybercriminals and involved three illegal cryptocurrency exchanges. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment charging Russian national Sergey Sergeevich Ivanov with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering using stolen credit and debit card information. Ivanov’s services have been used by cybercrime marketplaces, ransomware groups and hackers responsible for significant data breaches of major U.S. companies, the department said. Russian national Timur Shakhmametov faced similar charges in the indictment, the department said. In a coordinated action, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Ivanov and Cryptex, a virtual currency exchange based in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines but operating in Russia. The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on thousands of Russian targets since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The war has seen tens of thousands killed and cities destroyed. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also identified Russian crypto exchange PM2BTC, which is associated with Ivanov, as a “primary money laundering concern” in connection with Russian illicit finance. The Treasury financial crime bureau found that PM2BTC used “an unusual obfuscation” that made it harder to trace illicit transactions, it said. PM2BTC has longstanding ties to Russian or Russian-affiliated financial institutions that are under U.S. sanctions or other restrictions, according to Treasury. “The United States and our international partners remain resolute in our commitment to prevent cybercrime facilitators like PM2BTC and Cryptex from operating with impunity,” said Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for Treasury’s terrorism and financial intelligence unit. At the same time, the State Department announced rewards of up to $10 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Ivanov or Shakhmametov. The State Department is also offering rewards of up to $1 million each for information identifying the leaders of PM2BTC and stolen credit card marketplaces PinPays and Joker’s Stash.
