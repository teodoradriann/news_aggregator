    "text": "By Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis\nAYODHYA, India (Reuters) – Less than a month before a grand Hindu temple opens, India’s northern town of Ayodhya is buzzing with activity as finishing touches are put on a project seen as the centrepiece of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election campaign.\nOnce a sleepy temple town in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya has received a new airport and roads in a $6-billion facelift as Modi prepares to inaugurate the temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities.\nA day before Modi was set to inaugurate the airport and a renovated train station, workers decorated the streets with flowers, amid a swarm of police.\n“Soon our Lord will be in his original place,” said Girish Sahastrabhojane, who worked on the design of the temple, which forms part of a sprawling 70-acre (28-hectare) complex of carved pink sandstone and white marble.\n“Our Lord Ram was born here and the Hindus of India, and also abroad, have been waiting for it since 1992,” the engineer involved in the construction told visiting reporters.\nBut Modi’s opponents have accused him of stoking religious sentiment to further his political ambitions, and several opposition leaders have declined an invitation to attend the temple’s inauguration.\nOn Jan. 22, Modi will pray for the first time before an idol of Lord Ram at the project, which cost more than 20 billion rupees ($240 million), and where more than 4,500 workers are labouring round the clock to complete the ground floor.\nWearing hardhats and safety shoes, they worked on Friday to carve pillars and lift stones amid cranes towering over the site, which Sahastrabhojane said could accommodate 125,000 people in a day.\nModi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims.\nHe has made its construction an emotive issue in many speeches ahead of next year’s general elections, widely expected to secure him a third term.\nNationwide riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them minority Muslims, broke out in 1992 after a Hindu mob razed the Babri mosque – where the temple will stand – saying it was built on the site of an earlier Hindu temple.\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court ordered that Hindus be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.\n($1=83.1875 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis in Ayodhya; Writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "text": "Suspect wanted after elephant seal pup found stabbed on Oregon coast\nNESKOWIN, Ore. (KPTV/Gray News) - Law enforcement is asking for the public’s help finding the person who stabbed an elephant seal pup on the Oregon coast.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement says the incident happened in a cove on the beach in Neskowin in front of the Proposal Rock Condominiums on Sunday, March 16, between 8 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\nThe pup sustained multiple stab wounds but thankfully it survived. The Marine Stranding Team cared for the pup before relocating it.\nNOAA says the person of interest in the stabbing has been described as a white man, about 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a standard build, black and white hair, a groomed beard, and a large gap between his front teeth.\nThe suspect was seen wearing aviator glasses with thick lenses; a thin blue and light green fleece top over a thin, lined check shirt; low-profile back cap with a flat front and logo depicting an orange four-track excavator with the word “Timber”; dark trousers; and lightweight hiking-type shoes or low boots. He also had a thin blue and yellow cord around his neck, similar to what a climber might use.\nNOAA says it’s also seeking information about the owner of a vehicle that may be associated with the suspect. The vehicle was seen in the parking lot near the cover behind the Proposal Rock Condominiums.\nThe vehicle is described as a dark blue 1990s Dodge or Chrysler van with a rear passenger window on the driver’s side covered in plastic. The inside of the vehicle appeared to be “cluttered.”\nAnyone with information about this incident should call the NOAA Enforcement Hotline at 800-853-1964. You can leave tips anonymously.\nNOAA says harassing, harming, killing, or feeding wild elephant seals is prohibited under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Violations can be prosecuted and are punishable by up to $100,000 in fines and up to one year in jail.\nCopyright 2025 KPTV via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Argentina tenía un modo de gestión con un déficit tan loco que para encauzarlo habría que hacer sacrificios. Se dijo de sobra, 2 décadas con la mayor pérdida de poder adquisitivo de todo occidente, se trataba de elegir seguir así o romper esa inercia pero con unos años malos.\nDe verdad, es ridículo. Argentina es el peor caso de gestión económica de este siglo, habría que ir a Venezuela o países del 3er mundo o a países en guerra para ver algo comparable. Es mucho canteo que el meneante medio no tenga ni puñeterísima idea de lo que ha estado pasando en Argentina los últimos 20-30 años, y de pronto para criticar a un rival ideológico medio foro se autoproclame catedrático en argentinología.\n[#5](c5#c-5) tb resulta un poco curioso que todos los defensores de Milei en meneame son expertos en argentinologia . O no?\n[#6](c6#c-6) A mí siempre me ha parecido un mamarracho. Pero es una consecuencia lógica de la Argentina desde los 90 hasta hoy.\nPonerse a hacer gráficos con un excel y echarse las manos a la cabeza es absurdo tras ni medio año de Milei, que además no es nada que no se supiera. Argentina es un país cuya economía daba para por lo menos una portada mensual en menéame desde antes de la creación del propio portal.\n[#5](c5#c-5) O sea que para combatir \"2 décadas con la mayor pérdida de poder adquisitivo de todo occidente\", se implementan medidas que profundizan esa pérdida de poder adquisitivo...\nY eso para tí y los que te votan positivo, tiene sentido...\nPues nada, deberías sentirte orgulloso de la cantidad de gente que no puede comprar medicamentos, de las clínicas oncológicas cerradas, del incremento de la pobreza, y miles de cosas más. Todas, también, dichas en campaña, verdad?\nDesde luego que lo está haciendo bien.\nDejar de subvencionar con cargo al déficit y la deuda la energía, el transporte etc tiene la consecuencia de que la inflación se dispara.\nYa caerá.\nMilei sólo está destapando las vergüenzas de la economía argentina, que hasta ahora era una farsa\nEn un año la inflación estará por los suelos y la economía lista para crecer sin apoyarse en la impresión de papeles\ncc\n[#1](c1#c-1) [#2](c2#c-2) [#3](c3#c-3) [#4](c4#c-4) [#5](c5#c-5)\nMe jode tener yo que defender al mongolo de Milei, pero vamos si quitas subsidios y desregulas sectores es seguro que pasaría lo que está pasando.\nOtro punto es el precio a pagar por ello y si estas medidas van a mejorar el país en el medio-largo plazo o lo van a mandar al abismo directamente reventando la cohesión social.\n[#4](c4#c-4) \"El interrogante que más insiste con respecto a la ultraderecha argentina se refiere a la adhesión que aun suscita en sectores amplios de la población.\nEn efecto, un gobierno que no gobierna, un grupo de funcionarios inconsistentes y crueles, una agrupación de políticos bizarros que parecen testimoniar de una mutación antropológica en el centro del neoliberalismo provocan en el mundo la pregunta crucial: porqué un experimento con un coste de dolor tan amplio para la sociedad argentina no solo es soportable sino que parece estar apoyado por una fe inquebrantable.\nResponder a esto exigiría un conjunto de lecturas que sepan al menos caracterizar en qué tiempo histórico vivimos y si somos contemporáneos de algo nuevo y distinto. Pero mas allá de la necesaria reflexión teórica y crítica con respecto a la tragedia que le toca vivir a la Argentina, la única posibilidad de responder a esta situación siniestra es no dejarse subyugar por la foto fija de las encuestas y los votos obtenidos.\nLas encuestas y el sistema de votación nunca logran captar ciertos momentos privilegiados de lo micropolítico y de su capilarización en el tejido social. El supuesto 50 por ciento de apoyo del que dispone el ultraderechista se puede volatilizar de un instante a otro, y entonces puede emerger la verdad del militante, la verdad del que no cede, y entrega su vida a la más inmediata de las urgencias: combatir el hambre. Ya sabemos de quién estamos hablando.\nEsta es la hora de quien no se deja obnubilar por el peso inerte de los números y abraza la verdadera causa, la verdadera razón por la que ha decidido entregar su vida a la justicia.\nFrente al nihilismo de las encuestas, la verdad incondicional de la justicia social; no importa lo que digan si alguien ha decidido no prestarles mas atención.\nEn cada hombre y en cada mujer, uno por uno, en donde vibre una sensibilidad por la justicia y por el otro, un nuevo lazo social, un nuevo amor va abriendo su camino. Los días de la nueva política estan por venir\".\n[#8](c8#c-8) Por la misma razon que todos los que se quejan de nuestros fachas politicos, jueces, periodistas, empresarios...siguen aqui y no se van a otros paises superdemocraticos.\n[#8](c8#c-8) joder pues es bastante evidente no?\n- Sesgo temporal => Una chica obesa empieza a hacer ejercicio/dieta. Prefieres acostarme con ella ahora o en 1 año cuando haya perdido la mitad de peso? Pues eso.\n- Que un pais sea mejor economicamente no quiere decir que nos tengamos que mudar. Si esa fuera la logica, toda España se habria mudado a Zurich.\nHacedle caso a Eduardo Garzón, que tiene la receta para solucionar lo de Argentina:\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"Argentina no está limitada en términos financieros. Todos los pesos que se quieran crear, se pueden crear\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"La solución al paro es teclear dinero\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"El dinero es un invento y se puede crear sin límites\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"El dinero lo crea y regula el sector público, por lo que éste no necesita recaudar impuestos para financiarse.\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"Los ingresos de los funcionarios provienen del gasto del Estado, no de ningún impuesto.\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: Como si llega al 250% del PIB,como en Japón y viven mejor que nosotros, mientras el BCE siga comprando bonos la deuda pública no debe preocupar\n[#9](c9#c-9) la verdad esque es un pieza, pero honestamente, prefiero atacar a los argumentos antes de a la persona.\nAparte, es de la poca gente de la izquierda que se sienta a debatir contra liberales. Eso se lo tengo que conceder.\n[#36](c36#c-36) La parte en la que dice que ciertas cicatrices económicas tardarán años en arreglarse aunque Milei se fuese mañana me imagino que no te la has leído. Ah, hostias, enero de 2024. Nada más.\n[#41](c41#c-41) eso ya se sabia. Estais demasiados ansiosos porque a argentina le vaya mal, y no le va a ir mal a medio plazo, tiempo al tiempo.\nllevo en meneame desde el 2007 (ya no tengo acceso a mi cuenta antigua) y en foros desde mediados de los 90, por si dan medallas de antiguedad, y por si vale para ganar algun argumento.\n[#48](c48#c-48) se iba?? pero dale tiempo!!! no ha pasado nada todavia.\nLa inflacion se iba a disparar despues de las medidas de milei, era obvio!!!:\nhttps://es-us.finanzas.yahoo.com/noticias/subir-inflaci%C3%B3n-bajarla-terapia-choque-122832348.html\nREPITO, ya se que quieres que milei y argentina se hundan, dale tiempo, incluso la libertad requiere tiempo para poder disfrutarla.\n[#2](c2#c-2) ay mi madre el mensaje.\nTodo eso que menciona en la noticia, LLEVA PASANDO EN ARGENTINA DURANTE TODA LA DECADA. Y ha sido especialmente agudo durante los ultimos años. Lo que esta diciendo el articulo esque durante los 6 meses de gobierno se esta siguiendo la tendencia . No shit Sherlock, si te parece se puede revertir totalmente una tendencia en menos de 2 dias con ademas todo el congreso en contra.\nDe verdad, yo he llegado a ver como echaban a Milei culpa de la inflacion DE DICIEMBRE. Esto es como si Sanchez entrara al poder un 10 de Diciembre y le echaramos la culpa de la bajada de empleo en Diciembre. Seria completamente absurdo.\nY ahora contrataco. Hay un plan (que Milei ya ha explicado), para acabar con la inflacion y disminuir el desempleo. El plan esta de sobra explicado pero no veo que nadie haya mirado ni entendido el plan. Que tal si lo empezais a mirar y ver si os cuadra o no la idea?\n[#31](c31#c-31) En tu primer párrafo ya dejas claro que no sabes interpretar los gráficos. En tal caso, intercambiar mensajes contigo es tan efectivo como intentar derribar un castillo lanzándole merengues.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Siempre me han fascinado todos esos obreros y gente humilde que votan a profetas de la abundancia y vendedores de humo ,que más tarde les robarán lo poco que les quede .\nEs ya de puro psicópata defender a Milei y sus posturas empobrecedoras. Hasta la derecha más fiel en los medios empieza a poner con él tierra de por medio. Sólo hay que ver el último escándalo enorme de corrupción relacionado con la comida para los pobres. Y es que os recuerdo que ya el 55% de la población argentina es pobre.",

    "text": "□ 褚晓潇\n随着数字技术的发展，新一轮科技变革正悄然重塑产业格局，中国已迈入数字经济与实体经济深度融合新阶段。数字经济与制造业深度融合，不仅助力企业实现供需匹配与成本优化管理，而且还能通过数据要素流通构建新型信任体系，使企业在全球化竞争中保持核心优势。\n完善基础设施建设\n数字基础设施建设是制造业转型发展的基础。制造企业应加强内部软硬件设备建设，借助大数据、人工智能、5G、云计算等数字技术，加快实现传统制造业的数字化转型，并重视基础建设各环节的流程优化，通过多种技术叠加方式发挥倍增效应；在传统设备上加装数字设备，运用数字孪生等技术，通过智能监管与风险预测，确保制造业高质量发展。\n针对区域发展不平衡问题，政府部门应通过财政补贴、税收优惠等方式，加大对中西部地区制造业数字化转型的支持力度，推动区域间均衡发展；鼓励并支持区域间共建数据库，通过资源整合与共享，强化区域协同作用效果。\n加大数字支持力度\n政府政策支持为制造业转型升级构建了完善的生态体系。在宣传方面，政府部门应做好数字经济宣传工作，通过政策解读以及办理业务等方式，充分激活制造业数字化转型的内生动力。在金融支撑体系方面，设立制造业数字化转型专项基金，降低制造企业数字化转型成本；制定差异化发展计划，对数字经济与制造业高融合区域，可发挥试验区等优势带动周边制造业发展；对于低融合区域，可设置基础配套建设、要素流通、产业集群培育等分阶段目标，逐步实现制造业跨越式增长。\n强化科研创新赋能是制造业高质量发展的原动力。企业应增加科研投入来完善研发团队及实验室建设，尝试通过国际合作方式加快数字化转型步伐。另外，政府可适当提高研发费用加计扣除比例，鼓励企业注重关键技术革新；设立政府引导基金，通过风险补偿机制提高对创新失败的容忍率；建设技术交易市场，提高创新成果转化效率。\n重视 数字人 才引育\n数字技能人才是制造业高质量发展的关键支撑。为突破核心技术瓶颈，政府应联合企业及高校制定数字人才培养计划，通过订单式培养、产教融合方式，将理论教学与项目实践相结合，为企业培养数字技术人才。针对内部员工，企业一方面可定期开展数字技能培训，并激励员工在实践中应用，另一方面可建立员工学习档案库，将员工数字技能培训参与情况与绩效考核相关联，激发员工参与培训的积极性。\n建设高端数字人才数据库，通过教育背景、项目经验、技能特征等数据来完善人才动态画像，并借助数字技术实现企业与人才的精准匹配，并动态更新紧缺人才清单，靶向引进高技能数字人才；对高端数字人才给予住房及购房补贴、子女教育优待等特殊优惠，吸引并留住人才，从而为企业高质量发展提供智力支撑。\n（作者单位：宿迁学院；本文系江苏省高校哲社一般项目“江苏省制造业数字化转型的低碳发展路径研究”〈编号：2024SJYB1759〉研究成果）",
