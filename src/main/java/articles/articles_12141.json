    "text": "La defensa del expresidente Alberto Fernández apeló el procesamiento en la causa Seguros y pidió a la Cámara Federal porteña que dicte la falta de mérito. Mientras se ordenan nuevas medidas de prueba, la investigación profundiza la causa en manos del juez federal Sebastián Casanello.\nEl magistrado procesó a Fernández por hechos de corrupción en la contratación de seguros por parte de decenas de organismos públicos, pagando comisiones millonarias a intermediarios privados. Además, se lo acusó de montar “una oficina que pasó a ser asiento de un grupo empresarial del cual él mismo había participado”.\nPrimera baja de la alianza PRO-LLA: un intendente macrista pegó el portazo porque no quiere transar con \"zurdos\"\nSuscribite\nDe esta forma, Mariana Barbitta, abogada del expresidente, se encargó de presentar la apelación, después del procesamiento dictado el viernes por presuntas “negociaciones incompatibles con el ejercicio de la función pública”. Según la defensa, el exmandatario fue procesado por hechos por los que nunca se le tomó declaración indagatoria y por “conductas novedosas”, sin haber tenido la posibilidad de defenderse.\nLa abogada advirtió sobre la gravedad institucional y democrática de procesar a un expresidente “a partir de una investigación periodística” sin una pesquisa judicial “seria, amplia y objetiva”. A su vez, alegó una “persecución infundada” y ahora la decisión quedará en manos del Tribunal de Apelaciones.\nCausa de los Seguros\nLa denominada causa de los Seguros inició en la Justicia Federal penal a raíz del pago de millonarias comisiones en los contratos de seguros de ANSES. Al momento de ser citado a indagatoria, al exmandatario se lo vinculó con una supuesta “maniobra criminal”, basada en 45 contratos que distintos organismos públicos, 25 de los cuales habrían sido suscriptos con Nación Seguros SA.\nEl Gobierno activó una purga en la Procuración por posibles filtraciones en el caso YPF\nEsa operatoria habilitó la participación de brokers de seguros intermedios, quienes cobraron comisiones por un total de $3.364 millones. Según la causa, el 68% de esos pagos habría ido al grupo empresarial vinculado a Martínez Sosa, amigo personal de Fernández.\nEn consecuencia, 40 personas fueron indagadas en el marco de esta causa, luego de ser imputadas por “haber intervenido mancomunadamente en forma coordinada y funcional, aproximadamente entre el mes de diciembre de 2019 y el mes de diciembre de 2023, en un esquema de recaudación y distribución de fondos públicos por medio del irregular direccionamiento en la contratación e intermediación en seguros tomados por distintas reparticiones públicas en Nación Seguros”.\nBGD/DCQ",

    "text": "Ohio State Buckeyes' Will Howard Earns Major Ranking\nGoing into the 2024 college football season, there were a lot of questions about [Ohio State Buckeyes](https://www.si.com/college/ohiostate) quarterback Will Howard.\nHeck, there were concerns about him following Ohio State's dreadful loss to the [Michigan Wolverines](https://www.si.com/college/michigan) in the season finale, and the jury is really still out on the Kansas State transfer.\nHowever, there is no denying that Howard stepped up in the Buckeyes' first-round College Football Playoff game against the [Tennessee Volunteers](https://www.si.com/college/tennessee), as he went 24-for-29 with 311 yards, a couple of touchdowns and an interception.\nAs a result of his impressive performance, Tom Fornelli of CBS Sports ranked him the second-best quarterback remaining in the College Football Playoff, placing only [Oregon Ducks](https://www.si.com/college/oregon) signal-caller Dillon Gabriel above him.\n\"It was easy to say Ohio State should've thrown the ball more in the loss to Michigan -- I know because I said it, too -- but there are two sides to the story,\" [Fornelli wrote](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-qb-power-rankings-ohio-states-will-howard-surges-after-strong-first-round-showing/). \"You can't just call more pass plays; you need your quarterback to execute. Howard did that in a frigid Ohio Stadium on Saturday night. He dropped some absolute dimes en route to 311 yards passing while completing 24 of his 29 attempts. This week, he'll get a chance at redemption following his late-game gaffe in Eugene earlier this season.\"\nOn the season overall, Howard has thrown for 3,171 yards, 29 touchdowns and nine picks while completing 73.2 percent of his passes. He has also punched in seven rushing scores.\nHoward still has head-scratching moments, like when he threw an interception in the red zone during the first half against Tennessee.\nBut, for the most part, he has been everything Ohio State could have asked for since acquiring him via the transfer portal last year.\nWe'll see how he fares against Oregon in the Rose Bowl.",

    "text": "The outage began around 9:15 am UTC, with no new blocks produced thereafter. The Sui Foundation acknowledged the issue, stating that the network was not processing transactions and that a fix would be deployed shortly.\nSource: X\nThe downtime was attributed to a bug in the transaction scheduling logic, which caused validators to crash. By approximately 11:30 am UTC, the network resumed operations after the deployment of the fix.\nSource: X\nThe incident had immediate repercussions on Sui’s native cryptocurrency, SUI, which saw its price drop by over 5%, trading at $3.49. This decline led to the liquidation of approximately $2.17 million in long positions, as reported by Coinglass.\nThe outage also prompted reactions from the crypto community, with some drawing parallels between Sui and Solana, another blockchain that has faced multiple outages in the past. Critics questioned Sui’s reliability, especially given its ambition to rival Solana. However, supporters argued that a single incident should not overshadow Sui’s overall performance and potential.\nIn response to the outage, exchanges like Upbit temporarily halted SUI deposits and withdrawals, citing network issues. The swift resolution of the problem and the network’s return to normal operations were seen as positive signs of Sui’s resilience and the effectiveness of its development team.\nWhile this incident raised concerns about the network’s stability, it also highlighted the challenges that emerging blockchain platforms face as they scale and evolve. The Sui Foundation’ s prompt response and transparency during the outage were crucial in maintaining user trust and confidence in the platform’s future.",

    "text": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Young learners have new places to grow and thrive, as three new Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning open across the Appalachian Highlands of Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia.\nAs viewers and listeners tuned in to the first day of the annual Niswonger Children’s Network Radiothon, Ballad Health announced major steps towards fulfilling its commitment of opening up to 2,000 childcare slots across the region. New Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee; Lebanon, Virginia; and on the campus of East Tennessee State University are now open, with collective capacity to serve approximately 300 children. Each center serves Ballad Health team members and community members, and each accepts children who qualify for state childcare financial assistance in Tennessee and Virginia.\n“When we launched the Ballad Health Niswonger Children’s Network and our Strong Starts program, our intent was to integrate healthcare, education and community support and make the Appalachian Highlands the best place in the country to live, work and raise a family,” said Ballad Health Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Levine. “High-quality childcare not only helps ensure children are ready to learn by the time they enter school, but it helps parents and other caregivers pursue their own education and work goals with confidence. This benefits not only our team members, but the larger community as well.”\nIn an internal survey, Ballad Health team members emphasized that dependable childcare is a critical factor when choosing a place to live and work. To support this need, Ballad Health’s Board of Directors voted in early 2022 to invest up to $37 million to improve access to childcare by opening up to 11 new centers throughout the region, in addition to the current programs run by Ballad Health in Johnson City and Elizabethton, and a third run on the campus of Bristol Regional Medical Center by the YMCA of Bristol.\n“We’re thrilled to open the first of our new childcare centers to begin serving families in our communities,” said Dr. Amy Doran, Ballad Health’s corporate director of early care and education. “Together, we will work to ensure children are kindergarten-ready with a best-in-class curriculum that supports early literacy, numeracy and science skills, in addition to social and emotional development.”\nAll Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning will be open five days a week, from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., only closing on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.\n“Children, especially infants, toddlers and preschoolers, learn through play. It’s key to their social, emotional and critical thinking abilities,” said Dr. Seth Brown, chief medical officer for the Niswonger Children’s Network. “The curriculum at our childcare centers ensures that children aren’t just being looked after – they’re being set up for a lifetime of learning and growing, which helps prepare them for a brighter future of better health.”\nNow open: The Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee, and Lebanon, Virginia\nDuring the first day of the Radiothon, Ballad Health cut the ribbon on its Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee, and Lebanon, Virginia.\n“It’s been more than 10 years since we opened the doors of the first and only children’s hospital here in the Appalachian Highlands. It was a landmark moment for the region, and we continue to see returns on that investment every single day,” said Scott Niswonger, a Greeneville resident and chief benefactor for Niswonger Children’s Hospital and the Niswonger Children’s Network.\n“Investing in children’s well-being beyond the hospital is another milestone moment. The Ballad Health Strong Starts program, which supports families from birth to age 5, has thousands of participants region-wide, and the Strong Futures program here in Greenville supports hundreds of moms in addiction recovery and their children. Adding high-quality childcare to the mix locally is helping further wrap families in the type of support necessary for our children to learn and grow, and I am thrilled with Ballad Health’s continued commitment.\"\nLocated on the campus of Tusculum University, the Center for Early Learning in Greeneville features six classrooms bordering a common area, as well as a playground that includes innovative equipment to encourage imaginative play. At full capacity, 92 children, from infants to age 5, can be served.\nIn Lebanon, the Center for Early Learning is located less than three miles from Russell County Hospital, making it especially convenient for Ballad Health team members and their families. At full capacity, 70 children, from infants to age 5, can be served.\n“People with young families are a huge part of our team, and they’re crucial to our ability to provide care,” said Greta Morrison, administrator and chief nursing officer of Russell County Hospital. “The childcare crisis has a direct effect on the shortage of healthcare professionals and qualified professionals nationwide, and it is vital for everyone that there is adequate access to high quality childcare.”\nBallad Health, East Tennessee State University unveil partnership to expand access to childcare and train future educators\nThe Ballad Health and East Tennessee State University (ETSU) partnership will enhance ETSU’s current early childhood development curriculum, as students can complete their required observation hours at Ballad Health’s Centers for Early Learning, while developing hands-on experience under the guidance of licensed, experienced childcare professionals.\n“ETSU and Ballad health continue to partner to produce positive, generational change,” said Dr. Brian Noland, president of East Tennessee State University. “From the Strong BRAIN Institute – which promotes the awareness of best practices and empirical study of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) – to this newest childcare center on campus, where we will train the next generation of early childhood development professionals educating our children, our commitment to the region is always growing.”\nOnce a licensing transfer is complete, ETSU’s current childcare center will become part of the Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning, and it will be expanded accommodate significantly more children. The expanded center will continue to house current Little Bucs and Head Start students, while offering more childcare openings for team members of Ballad Health and ETSU, as well as community members. At full capacity, at least 133 children, from infants to age 5, can be served.\n“Even with the addition of these centers, new centers slated to open in Norton, Kingsport and Abingdon later this year and Ballad Health’s future expansion efforts, the region still has a long way to go in terms of completely addressing the shortage of high-quality childcare,” Levine said. “We believe this effort is a model of how employers, government and community organizations can partner to tackle this challenge.”\nRegistration information\nFamilies interested in enrolling their children in Ballad Health’s Early Learning Centers, or those who have questions, should fill out this form: https://redcap.link/ChildcareInterestForm or call 423-430-7632.\nRadiothon continues to support local children’s care\nThe Niswonger Children’s Network Radiothon, which supports Niswonger Children’s Hospital and the extension of other children’s network services, continues on Friday, March 1, airing on 98.5 WTFM, 95.9 The Hog WRZK, Classic Hits 102.7 WVEK, and ESPN Tri-Cities from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. News Channel 11 anchors will also broadcast live from the event in the children’s hospital lobby.\nInterested donors can call 855-611-KIDS (5437) to make their pledges.
