    "text": "BEHRIN (SWAT): Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said here this afternoon [July 11] that the Opposition was trying to create problems for the Government with a view to diverting its attention from development activities. Addressing a public meeting in Behrin … the Prime Minister said that the Ahmadi problem was being discussed by the National Assembly and his endeavour would find its correct solution. … [He] urged the people to identify the enemies of Pakistan. … The Prime Minister, who dwelt at length on the attitude of the Afghan rulers towards Pakistan, said they should not “exceed the limits”. [Meanwhile, as reported by news agencies from the UN,] Lebanon told the Security Council yesterday [July 10] that Israeli attacks earlier this week against Lebanese port cities demonstrated that Israel no longer cared even to justify its aggression. Mr. Yahya Mahmassani, acting chief of the Lebanese delegation, said … “the Security Council, particularly the permanent members, and the world community cannot remain indifferent spectators when the Israeli forces carry out their policy of terror, murder and blackmail against a member State of the United Nations”.

    "text": "FREEPORT, Ill. (WREX) — On April 24, a blue Kia Soul was reported stolen from a home in the 400 block of West Roosevelt Street in Freeport. Approximately one hour later, a report was received of a blue Kia Soul driving erratically in the area of East Wyandotte Street and South Fruit Avenue. Officers located the vehicle in the area of South Bauscher Avenue and East Garden Street and tried to pull the car over. The Kia did not stop and continued driving westbound on East Empire Street from South Bauscher Avenue. To prevent a potential collision, officers blocked traffic at Galena Avenue and Empire Street. The Kia continued through the intersection and then crashed in the 500 block of E. Empire Street. The only occupant of the car, a 14-year-old male, was arrested. Investigation revealed damage to the steering column and altered to enable the Kia to be started without a key fob. No injuries or additional property damage were reported. The teen resident of Freeport was processed at the Police Department and released to a parent.",

    "title": "Ireland auto enrollment",
    "text": "Next January, all going well, approximately 750,000 workers in Ireland will start being automatically enrolled into a new workplace pension scheme that will be co-funded by their employers and the State.\nThe scheme is aimed at addressing the national pension coverage gap. It’s estimated that just 56% of the working population in Ireland has access to a company or personal pension scheme, a figure that drops to as low as 35% for the private sector alone.\nA key feature of ‘pension auto-enrolment’ is that your participation is voluntary. So if you are enrolled and you don’t want to be, you will be able to opt-out.\nPension auto-enrolment has proven a powerful and effective tool for governments around the world in their efforts to improve pension coverage for its citizens.\nThe United Kingdom introduced auto-enrolment in 2012, and as of January 2023 over 10.8 million employees have been automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. To put it another way, the percentage of eligible private sector employees saving into a workplace pension has more than doubled in just over a decade.\nHowever, it’s taken quite some time for auto-enrolment to become a reality in Ireland. So much so, that Ireland remains the only country in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) that doesn’t yet operate auto-enrolment or a similar system as a means of promoting pension savings.\nIt’s not as if we haven’t talked about it. Last year, while announcing details of the new workplace scheme, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphrey, said that auto-enrolment had been “part of the national conversation on pensions” for over 25 years.\nBut a recent survey by the Central Statistics Office suggests that awareness of its impending introduction of the scheme was still low. Only 18% of those respondents who had no pension coverage (outside the state pension) said they were aware of the plan, but nonetheless 65% said that they would stay in the scheme if automatically enrolled in it.\nHowever, part of the low awareness could be down to the fact that there remains a good deal of uncertainty about when the scheme will start. Even now, there are strong signals being sent from both the government and employers that even the current target launch date of January 2024 may not be met. For instance, Department of Finance officials revealed in early 2023 that this target was “somewhat ambitious”.\nFurthermore, the scheme, when it begins, will be phased in gradually over a 10-year period. This means contributions will be low initially, to allow employees and employers time to adapt to it, but it also means it will take a decade for contributions to hit the target level of 14%.\nWhile no one doubts that auto-enrolment will go a long way to improving the state of the nation’s pension savings, it does seem like waiting on the launch of this scheme to kick-start your own retirement savings could be a false economy.\nSo if you have employees who haven’t joined their occupational pension scheme or started a personal pension of their own, it’s time to open the pension awareness conversation and encourage people to take action now.\nIf you’re not sure what this news means for you and your people, get in touch and we’ll talk you through everything you need to know.",

    "text": "\\nAfter an impressive bullish breakout last week, Ethereum (ETH) price has significantly declined the rising momentum. The leading altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $377 billion, has dropped over 6 percent since Tuesday to trade around $3,133 on Thursday, November 14, during the mid-New York session.\n\\nNevertheless, the fear of a major crypto capitulation has significantly declined, since Bitcoin entered its price discovery phase. As of this writing, Ethereum\\u2019s fear and greed index has surged to 78 percent, which represents extreme greed from traders.\n\\n Key Levels to Watch for Ethereum Price Ahead \\nEthereum price recently confirmed the resurgence of bullish sentiment after successfully rebounding from the 200-weekly Moving Average (MA). For the first time since the August 5 crypto crash, Ether price has consistently closed above the crucial support/resistance range between $2,800 and $2,900.\n\\n \\n \\n \\nPoh, $ETH is having such a painful chart against Bitcoin.\n\\nWe\\u2019re still waiting for more rate cuts to come in, through which the Yields will drop and Ethereum will become more attractive.\n\\nPainful chart. pic.twitter.com/FwKCMtkLkX\n\\n\\u2014 Micha\\xebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 14, 2024\n\\n \\nCrypto analyst Micha\\xebl van de Poppe has reminded investors that the altcoin has been bleeding to Bitcoin for the past two years. In the daily time frame of the ETH/BTC pair, a bullish reversal pattern has been forming with a support level of around 0.034, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\\nWith the notable spike in interest for Ether by institutional investors, Ether\\u2019s price is well slated for more gains ahead.\n\\nFor instance, the US spot Ether ETFs have accumulated more than $500 million in the past few days.\n\\n Altseason Timings\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n \\n #ALT Season is when #BTC dominance aggressively goes down. #BTC Season is when #BTC dominance slowly goes up.\n\\nBTC dominance has been going up for years, which is why it was better to be in BTC than most ALTs.\n\\nClearly I am not talking about your alt, just everyone else\\u2019s alt. pic.twitter.com/bCyOxzhT9P\n\\n\\u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) November 13, 2024\n\\n \\nAccording to renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, altcoin investors should not FOMO into rallying meme coins as the real altseason has not yet begun. Moreover, Bitcoin dominance has been gaining ground against the altcoin market in the past two years.\n\\nCowen highlighted that the real altseason will happen when Bitcoin dominance aggressively goes down. Currently, the OTHERS/BTC pair has been dropping, having reached the lowest level after Bitcoin price surged above $93k on Wednesday.\n\\n \\n SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.

(JAI: Jubilación anticipada Involuntaria).\nA toda esta \"artimaña\" le queda poquito. Europa ya se está moviendo para evitar estos asuntos.\n4\nK\n48\n#28\nNoviembre_2024\n#10\nEn Francia es bastante más complicado despedir, recursos humanos lo tendría muy bien planteado para poder despedir a alguien con una enfermedad y de sesenta años con cuarenta años trabajados.\nEl despiste ha sido lo de la medalla.\n1\nK\n23\n#3\nPixmac\nFalta información.

Podrán adaptarte un puesto a tus posibilidades pero no se debe esperar nada más allá.\n2\nK\n34\n#36\nNobby\n#3\nno seré yo quien defienda a una empresa frente a un trabajador, pero existe un concepto llamado \"ineptitud sobrevenida\".

    "text": "Police report details grisly crime scene in Greenfield |Published: 04-25-2024 5:22 PM| SUNDERLAND — Police located a cabin in the woods around Clark Mountain Road Thursday afternoon believed to belong to Taaniel Herberger-Brown, the suspect accused of murdering a man at 92 Chapman St. and storing his body in a plastic barrel for an extended amount of time. Greenfield Police Chief Todd Dodge said Herberger-Brown signed his name on the cabin’s interior wall and police found what they believed to be the owner’s manual to his motor vehicle. “Thankfully the cabin was empty with no signs of any additional activity,” Dodge said. Police swarmed the woods on Wednesday night and Thursday morning after they were alerted that Herberger-Brown might have a cabin in the area. Dodge said the search uncovered what police believe to be military discharge paperwork on a nature trail with Herberger-Brown’s name on it. Because the suspect was arrested Tuesday, he said, residents in that area are not in any danger. The Albany (N.Y.) County Sheriff’s Office arrested Herberger-Brown, 42, of Greenfield, on a murder charge Tuesday night at Albany International Airport after Greenfield police found dismembered human remains inside his recently vacated apartment on Chapman Street. Authorities have not publicly identified the victim. “The individual in custody made statements during booking in [New York] that led us to believe he may have a cabin in that area,” Dodge said during the search Wednesday night. As part of the search, officers launched an aerial drone from a Greenfield Police Special Operations truck as a search crew rode into the woods on all-terrain vehicles. Greenfield and Sunderland police and Massachusetts State Police scoured the wooded area behind Cliffside Apartments. Article continues after...

After entering the vacated room, the landlord noticed an object sticking out of a plastic bag in a large trash barrel and reported a “bad odor and possible blood leaking from the trash barrel,” according to a report by Massachusetts State Trooper Blakeley Pottinger. When Greenfield Police Officer Brent Griffin arrived at the apartment, he reported smelling “a strong foul odor that he believed, from his training and experience, was consistent with a decomposing human body.” Griffin also reported seeing trash and furniture scattered across the apartment, according to the police report. “Officer Griffin indicated that the body appeared to be wrapped in a plastic bag and placed in the trash barrel, consistent with an attempt to conceal and dispose of the body,” the report states. “He realized the blood and flesh had been decomposing for an extended amount of time.” Griffin called for backup from the State Police Detective Unit, the report states. Multiple items were seized from the apartment, including knives, a hatchet and a laptop. At 1 a.m. Tuesday, investigators received information that Herberger-Brown was at Albany International Airport. According to Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple, Herberger-Brown was arrested at the “observation deck,” or the airport’s non-secure third-story deck, after sheriff’s deputies discovered his car in the parking lot. Greenfield Police and Massachusetts State Police later met Herberger-Brown in Albany and interrogated him. “He didn’t even have an airline ticket or anything,” Apple said. “He was literally up in the observation deck probably trying to figure out what his next move was.” Herberger-Brown reportedly told investigators he planned to visit his mother outside of the country, and suggested several different locations he might travel to, including Vancouver, Germany, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. The police report states that he initially told authorities he had been in and out of hospitals and hadn’t been back at his apartment in months, but he later told investigators he got into a physical fight with someone who had broken into his home. He was unclear about when the altercation occurred. He reportedly told police he believed the person was using drugs and that the victim’s “heart stopped” after the altercation, the police report states. “After the altercation, Herberger-Brown told investigators that he left the apartment to obtain a tire rotation on his vehicle,” the report states. Wednesday morning, biohazard cleanup trucks lined the driveway behind 92 Chapman St. as State Police entered the apartment, taking photos of its interior. Herberger-Brown’s neighbors in the community known as Chapman Court watched as police entered and exited. Kayleigh Miller, who lives next door, described Herberger-Brown as a “super nice and super polite guy,” who would often lend a hand around the community, babysitting for some of his other neighbors. Miller said she had a brief exchange with Herberger-Brown when she left the house early Monday morning, in which Herberger-Brown made polite conversation with her before giving her a “pop quiz” on “which kinds of meat to grill.” Herberger-Brown is currently in custody at the Albany County Correctional Facility. According to Laurie Loisel, a spokesperson for the Northwestern District Attorney’s Office, it is unclear when he will be extradited back to Massachusetts to face charges.

    "text": "On November 29–30, BIRN Kosovo trained 29 journalists and freelancers in Prishtina on ways to enhance their ability to investigate and report on money laundering.\nThe event, organised by BIRN Kosovo and supported by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, FCDO, aimed to equip journalists with the skills they need to shed light on financial crimes, a critical area often shrouded in complexity.\nThe training included a diverse lineup of experts, including financial forensics specialists, intelligence officers and prosecutors. The workshop underscored the role of journalism in promoting accountability and transparency, by uncovering financial misconduct.\nDay one began with an introduction to the Joint Intelligence Network Against Money Laundering, delivered by Besnik Veseli, from the Tax Administration of Kosovo.\nThis session set the stage for a detailed examination of money laundering schemes, real-life cases in Kosovo and successful investigative methods drawn from the UK.\nAlan Barr and Nick Wilcox, key figures in the UK-Kosovo Anti-Money Laundering Programme, provided insights into the challenges of combating financial crime in the Balkans.\nA highlight was a practical exercise led by Visar Prebreza, a financial forensics expert, in which participants worked in groups to apply investigative techniques to hypothetical scenarios.\nThe day concluded with a working dinner at which Kosovo’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor, Ersan Qavolli, discussed the challenges of tackling money laundering cases.\nThe second day delved into practical aspects of journalism, with sessions on tracing money laundering through tax and company records and company.\nJournalists explored ways to identify high-risk sectors and typologies, analyze case studies and leverage their right to access information under Kosovo’s laws.\nIn a collaborative exercise, participants explored a fictional case of a company suspected of money laundering. Guided by the experts, they developed strategies to track money flows, draft investigative plans, and identify red flags.\nKreshnik Gashi, editor-in-chief of KALLXO.com , guided participants through the complexities of reporting on money laundering. He led sessions on understanding the right to access information crucial for uncovering financial crimes and on ways journalists can use investigative tools to expose illicit financial activities.\nGashi also explored the consequences of failing to investigate money laundering, shedding light on how unchecked financial crimes can fuel corruption and organised crime.\nHe emphasized the importance of collaboration between journalists and institutions, highlighting how investigative reporting can hold authorities accountable and empower citizens to demand transparency.\nThe workshop stressed the importance of journalism in combating financial crime. By providing journalists with the tools to investigate complex cases, it will help to foster a more informed and vigilant media landscape in Kosovo. As financial crime evolves, such initiatives will be key to ensuring transparency and upholding the rule of law.",

    "text": "05/03/2025 / Exitosa Noticias / Actualidad / Actualizado al 05/03/2025\nEl Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú (Senamhi) activó una alerta roja ante la posible ocurrencia de huaicos en las próximas horas. La entidad, adscrita al Ministerio del Ambiente (Minam), advierte que este fenómeno se registrará en Ancash y otras regiones de la sierra sur, debido a las fuertes lluvias registradas durante los últimos días.\nPosible activación de huaicos durante las próximas horas\nDe acuerdo con su aviso de corto plazo N° 064-2025, emitido este miércoles 5 de marzo, existen altas probabilidades de que ocurra una activación de quebradas, las cuales estarían asociadas a las precipitaciones pronosticadas para las siguientes 24 horas.\nAsimismo, la entidad considera que las lluvias registradas durante la última semana, así como la susceptibilidad a movimientos en masa en lugares inestables, serían causantes de fuertes deslizamientos en distintas zonas del Perú.\n¿Qué regiones serán afectadas por los huaicos?\nSegún el organismo meteorológico, regiones como Piura y Tumbes cuentan con una alerta amarilla, umbral que sugiere una severidad moderada en la activación de quebradas. Por otro lado, los departamentos de Apurímac, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Huancavelica, Junín, Lima y Pasco poseen una alerta naranja, por lo que estima una fuerte severidad con respecto a los huaicos.\nSin embargo, el pronóstico adquiere mayor nivel de peligrosidad en varias zonas de Ancash, Huánuco y Puno. Dichas regiones cuentan con alerta roja, lo que sugiere una severidad extrema respecto a los deslizamientos en masa. En total, son 11 departamentos los que poseen este umbral de alerta.\n- Ancash\n- Arequipa\n- Cusco\n- Huánuco\n- La Libertad\n- Loreto\n- Moquegua\n- Puno\n- San Martin\n- Tacna\n- Ucayali\nAl respecto, el Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia Nacional del Instituto de Defensa Civil (COEN-INDECI) compartió un boletín informativo con las localidades de posible afectación. A continuación, presentamos la infografía con las zonas que podrían registrar estos fenómenos meteorológicos.\nSenamhi recomienda tomar precauciones por deslizamientos\nAsimismo, la entidad perteneciente al Minam resalta lo importante que es revisar los protocolos de emergencia en las localidades mencionadas. Por tal motivo, sugiere a la población resguardar sus bienes y viviendas, alejarse del río y preparar una mochila de emergencia, a fin de evitar un impacto severo por los deslizamientos.\n\"Revisar procedimientos de emergencia. Reprogramar actividades en áreas expuestas al impacto de activación de quebradas. Proteger bienes y viviendas. Estar atentos a la información oficial y seguir instrucciones de las autoridades competentes\", se lee entre su recomendaciones.\nCon esta nueva alerta roja, Senamhi incluyó a las 11 regiones que podrían registrar una activación de huaicos durante las próximas horas. Por tal motivo, exhortó a la población que reside en estas zonas tomar medidas de precaución lo más pronto posible.",
