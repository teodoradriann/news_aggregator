    "text": "“It’s never too late or too early to get help”: AWAY hopes 2024 brings positive changes to victims of domestic violence, other abuses BECKLEY, [W.Va](http://w.va/). (WVVA) - With the New Year less than a week away, people all across the world are looking to make changes in their lives. These changes could be physical, financial or mental; and some of them, according to those at AWAY, could even be life-saving. Every month, AWAY, the advocacy center formerly known as the Women’s Resource Center, in Beckley helps between 250 and 300 people escape domestic violence and other abuses across four counties (Raleigh, Fayette, Nicholas and Summers). And in 2024, they hope you take the step to get help if you need it. “Most New Year’s resolutions come down to bettering ones’ self, right? And better your situation,” shared Erin Jones, Assistant Executive Director for AWAY. “And we’re here to help you through that entire process, whether it is domestic violence or if it is sexual violence or stalking- anything like that. We’re going to be able to help you with it and help you figure out the best options for you.” Jones tells WVVA that, for most people, deciding to get out of an abusive situation is the hardest part of getting help. That’s why AWAY works to make every step after just a little bit easier. “If you’re looking for a divorce and trying to figure out child custody, we can help with things like that. You know, if you’re looking for medical advocacy- you don’t want to go alone going through the process of maybe after an injury from one of these people- we can be there with you through that entire process as well. You need a safe place to stay, and you’re scared cause maybe there’s stalking or something’s going on- they know where your parents live, they know where your friends are and you’re really scared of things like that- we have a place where you can stay. We have a shelter that’s 24/7. You can call us anytime.” As New Year’s draws closer, Jones has one question for anyone wanting to make the leap of faith from survivor mode to survivorship. “Is this the year that you’re gonna make the decision? And we can’t make that choice for you, but we hope that you are in a safe, happy, healthy situation. And if you’re not, please call us.” For more information or to receive help, call AWAY at 304-255-2559. Copyright 2023 WVVA. All rights reserved.",

Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website.

Bhullar ordered officials to expedite the installation of advanced surveillance systems.The prisons minister also said that he would meet chief minister Bhagwant Mann to discuss funding allocation for the jails department to ensure adequate resources for modernisation initiatives and essential amenities.

Please Use Discernment.\nFauci Admits None Of The 72 Mandatory Childrens Vaccines Were Ever Safety Tested – December 19, 2024\nGet Awesome Patriot Gear Today! Pay Just S&H For Most Items!\n————————————————————\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has recounted how, when threatened with a lawsuit, Dr. Anthony Fauci was forced to admit that none of the 72 vaccines that are currently mandated for children in the US has ever been safety tested.\nSpeaking at a Hillsdale College event, Kennedy, who is Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said:\n“For many years, I was saying that not one of the 72 vaccines mandated for children has ever been safety tested in pre-licensing, placebo-controlled trials……Not one.”\nFauci had even gone do so far as to call Kennedy “a liar.”\nLifeSite News reports: When then-President Trump appointed Kennedy to run a vaccine safety commission, Trump ordered Fauci and Collins to meet with him along with White House counsel present.\nKennedy told Fauci, “You say I’m lying. For eight years you’ve been saying I’m lying,” and challenged Fauci to “show me the study” which shows that the multitude of vaccines America’s children are required to receive have been safety-tested.\nFauci claimed that he didn’t have it with him. “It’s back in Bethesda. I’ll send it to you.”\n“I never got it,” said Kennedy, “so I sued him.”\n“After stonewalling us for a year, their lawyers met us on the courthouse steps and said, ‘Yup, you’re right. We never had any study,’” said Kennedy.\nKennedy went on to explain how lucrative government-mandated children’s vaccines have been for the pharmaceutical industry:\nThere’s no downstream liability, there’s no front-end safety testing – that saves them a quarter billion dollars – and there’s no marketing and advertising costs, because the federal government is ordering 78 million school kids to take that vaccine every year.\nWhat better product could you have? And so there was a gold rush to add all these new vaccines to the schedule that we don’t need. Most of these vaccines are unnecessary. Many of them are for diseases that are not even casually contagious.\nIt was a gold rush, because if you get onto that schedule, it’s a billion dollars a year for your company.\nAnd in many cases, NIH is earning the royalties.\nAccording to Kennedy, more obscene than the huge profits being horded by Big Pharma are the vast number of negative side-effects from all those untested vaccines.\n“Neurological diseases” have “exploded,” he said.\n“ADHD, sleep disorders, language delays, ASD, autism, Tourette’s syndrome, ticks, narcolepsy. These are all things that I never heard of,” said Kennedy. “Autism went from one in 10,000 in my generation according to CDC data to one in every 34 kids today.”\nKennedy is known for vehemently opposing vaccines, a stance he adopted after the mothers of vaccine-injured children implored him to look into the research linking thimerosal to neurological injuries, including autism. He went on to found Children’s Health Defense, an organization with the stated mission of “ending childhood health epidemics by eliminating toxic exposure,” largely through vaccines.\nKennedy said in October that Trump has asked him to reorganize and “clean up” federal health agencies like the CDC and FDA. This would involve ending conflicts of interest that favor the interests of pharmaceutical companies over evidence-based medicine, according to Kennedy.\nFrom thepeoplesvoice.tv\n————————————————————",
