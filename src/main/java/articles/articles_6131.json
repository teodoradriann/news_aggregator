Menzel sang the opening of the number, but it was when Fallon hit play on the Casio keyboard that the soaring ballad was kicked up a notch to the showtstopper the world knows by heart.\nThe Tonight Show Host provided some backing vocals, but left the difficult high notes for Menzel, who belted them effortlessly — while sitting down, no less.\nElsa is just one of the iconic roles Menzel has played throughout her career. She originated the role of Elphaba in [Wicked](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/franchise/wicked) on Broadway, and even [made a special cameo](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/wicked-movie-cameos-from-the-musical) in the 2024 film adaptation alongside with her original Wicked co-star Kristin Chenoweth.\n\"Let It Go\" has been a phenomenon since its 2013 release — so much so that the song has been certified Diamond, meaning it \"has moved at least 10 million equivalent units by combining sales and streaming numbers.\"\n[RELATED: The Wicked Broadway Cameos You May Have Missed in the Wicked Movie](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/wicked-movie-cameos-from-the-musical)\n\"I'll never get sick of it, honestly.

    "title": "The rise of tiny Miyawaki forests in Australian suburbs | Newcastle Herald | Newcastle, NSW",
    "text": "Picture the scene: a dense forest of countless native trees, a thick canopy shading a nearly invisible ground blanketed by shrubs and plants in a state of nature brimming with life. Now, picture the same thriving in a suburban neighbourhood. The forest is the size of a tennis court - you could encircle it in a matter of seconds - and it has grown to almost six metres in little more than a year. The tiny forest is a complete native ecosystem - hundreds, almost 1000 native trees and shrubs planted in a dense matrix calculated to perfectly reflect the sprawling natural environment in which it (somewhat literally) jumped out of the ground - but it takes up about the same amount of space as a suburban garage. There's a unique harmony to the spectacle. The trees grow so quickly because their proximity to each other fosters fierce natural competition as the canopy rapidly expands to support a root system plunging downward with equal vigour. The soil has been overturned and loosed, primed with rich organic material to promote growth. It's an afforestation method conceived by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki around the 1970s for establishing rapid-growing natural and organic new forests in barren areas, and it has become a darling of the urban reforestation and conservation movement. A Miyawaki forest can be planted in as little as three square metres and grows about 10 times faster and 30 times denser than the naturally-occurring variety and contains almost as much as 100 times the biodiversity. \"A tiny forest is a small, but complete ecosystem,\" Anna Noon said. Ms Noon is the co-founder of the conservation outfit Groundswell Collective in the Hunter and the botanist who has built six tiny forests throughout the region with more on the way. She said the tiny forest was a practical, straight-forward answer to the complexities and anxieties around climate change, particularly as it pertains to urban sprawl, and an answer to practical carbon capture, flood mitigation and urban heat reduction in the suburbs. \"I think that's the very cool thing about it,\" Ms Noon said of borrowing the Japanese example and applying it to the Australian environment. \"There are about 3500 tiny forests around the world - in Japan, India, Europe, the Middle East and now here in Australia - and if you follow the steps, everyone should get the same outcome which is rapid growth and high levels of biodiversity.\" Ms Noon was due to travel to Yokohama in Japan on Friday to speak at an international symposium of Miyawaki forest creators at the university where one of the first tiny forests was planted. She has been seconded to a panel discussion there covering various case studies of tiny forests around the world, including in the Hunter, and how and where the forests have been built in different contexts. \"There is a kind of instant gratification element that I think people in this day and age love,\" Ms Noon said of the concept. \"We put them in the ground and 12 months later, they are six metres tall. That's not very usual when you're planting trees ... that is one of the benefits of it; we are taking generally high-maintenance patches of grass that are being mowed routinely and turning them into these fully-functional, self-sustaining ecosystems. \"I've just met so many incredible community members from planting these forests, and those people have gone on to be lifelong friends with me and with each other. So it's really connecting people together and connecting people to the land and to place.\" Ms Noon was the Lake Macquarie Volunteer of the Year in 2024 for her work creating tiny forests at [Teralba](https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8209397/little-hands-make-a-mighty-start-on-lake-macquaries-tiny-forest-at-teralba/), Edgeworth, and Gateshead as well as others at Tocal, Cardiff Heights, Cedar Bush Creek and Booragal. Nominations for the 2025 Volunteer of the Year opened again in October. Nominations can be made through the local council website.",

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel - Prince George Citizen",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "The Telegraph Michael Morpurgo: We can’t let a fear of upsetting children stop us from talking to them about war Michael Morpurgo May 5, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. · 11 min read Link Copied Read full article 'I grew up in an age of heroes': illustration by Michael Foreman for Finding Alfie: A D-Day Story by Michael Morpurgo - Michael Foreman/Scholastic\nThere was a time when the books I was writing for young people were often ­dismissed as nostalgic or ­irrelevant. Less often now, I hope.\nWar Horse was one such story. Although it was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize in 1982, it was the opinion of some of the judges, I was told, that children weren’t interested in history, that war was the past. ­Children liked to live, I was advised, in the now. I’d been a teacher for eight years, and a father too, so I knew this wasn’t true. How else can we begin to comprehend today, or conceive of tomorrow, if we know nothing about yesterday?\nI grew up in an age of heroes. I was born in 1943. I spent my early years in post-war London, where our playgrounds were bomb sites. On the way to school, I had to walk past a blind veteran who was often sitting outside the sweet shop, playing a mouth organ. He had a Jack Russell that bared its teeth and growled at me even when I was walking by on the other side of the road. I never liked to go too close to that dog, or that ­veteran. Others did, and would drop coins sometimes into his upturned helmet. He saluted everyone who did.\nI had another reason for not going too near. The blind soldier always dressed smartly, and wore a row of medals on his blue blazer with silver buttons. Everything about him was tidy, and I liked the tunes he played. But all I could think about was that he had only one leg, one shoe. His other trouser leg was folded underneath him somehow. It was his missing leg that horrified me, that haunted me, but fascinated me. I would dare to stare at him sometimes as I passed by, but my mother’s hand would tighten on mine and she would tell me not to stare, that it was rude.\nI learnt that same lesson when a family friend came to visit. Eric Pearce was always smart, his shoes shining, and he had a gold watch chain, which dangled from his ­waistcoat pocket. He had been a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, I’d been told, had won lots of medals and was very brave. He’d spent the war flying his plane off an ­aircraft carrier out at sea, attacking German submarines.\nBut I wasn’t so interested in that. I was much more fascinated by one side of Eric’s face, by his left ear that was hardly there, by his strange wandering eye that didn’t seem to see, by the reddened skin that looked unnaturally thin and stretched over his cheekbone, and by his hand with fewer fingers. In the war, my mother told me, Eric’s plane had crash-landed and burst into flames. He’d been dragged from the burning ­wreckage badly burnt, nearly dead, and spent years in hospital .\nMy mother impressed upon me every time Eric came to tea, that it was rude to stare. ­However hard I tried, my eyes seemed to be drawn to his face. I met Eric 60 or more years later, when he was nearly 100, in a home, and apologised for staring at him as I had. He smiled, and told me he hadn’t minded one bit. He much preferred it when people stared, he told me, than when they looked the other way.\n'I wanted to prove myself in the same fire in which both my uncles had been tested': Michael Morpurgo - Jay Williams\nMy uncle Pieter was simply a photograph on the mantelpiece at home when I was growing up. He was the uncle I never met. All I knew was that my mother, his ­sister, who adored him, often cried when anyone mentioned his name.\nHe was in the RAF, in Bomber Command , based in Cornwall. He had been on a raid over German-occupied France. But his plane had been hit over their target in Brest, and the pilot was too badly hurt to go on flying the plane. My uncle Pieter was a Sergeant Navigator, and had never flown a plane before. As they came in over the coast of Cornwall, Pieter flying the plane as best he could, he told the rest of the crew to bale out, and then, knowing the pilot was too badly injured to jump, he tried to land the plane himself at his home base at St Eval. The plane crashed on landing and they were both killed. The ­remainder of the crew lived.\nUncle Pieter was 22 when he died. He had been an actor, trained at Rada, extraordinarily handsome from his photograph. He is buried in the churchyard in Radlett, near his parents’ home. His courage has inspired me all my life.\nThe story of Uncle Pieter’s elder brother, Francis Cammaerts, has been just as influential. Uncle ­Francis was a teacher. He was also a socialist and a pacifist. So when war was declared, he took a very different path from Uncle Pieter, who had joined up almost at once. Francis had to go before a tribunal to convince them his pacifism was genuine. He was sent to help on a farm in Lincolnshire, ploughing and sowing, shepherding sheep, raising pigs.\nThen he heard that his beloved brother had been killed. Unwilling now to stay out of it, he joined up. A teacher friend of his, Harry Ree, had joined some mysterious unit he said he could not talk about, and advised Francis to go along to see them. That Francis spoke fluent French would help, he said.\nSo Francis went along to an address in London that Harry gave him, and within a few months found himself being trained up in Scotland, as a secret agent in the Special Operations Executive, and then dropped into France to link up with the Resistance there. In two years he effectively became the leader of 10,000 Maquis resistance fighters across the whole south of France. He was known to be brave as a lion, never rash, a formidable organiser, and much loved by all who fought with him. He soon had a price on his head, sought after by the Gestapo and the Milice – the French police collaborating with the occupiers. After the war, Francis went straight back to teaching. I was fortunate to get to know him well in his old age.\n'How can we begin to conceive of tomorrow, if we know nothing about yesterday?': still from the 2011 film adaptation of War Horse - Alamy\nAfter school, I found myself ­wondering what path in life to take. I think I wanted to prove myself in the same fire in which both my uncles had been tested. I joined up, became a soldier, went to Sandhurst, learnt more about comradeship, less about shooting straight or ­polishing boots perfectly. I left the Army, and went off to university, then into teaching, and through teaching into writing.\nBut it’s hardly surprising – being a child born in war – that war, and the terrible consequences of it, have played such a prominent part in my stories over the years.\nThere is a difficulty in writing about the suffering of war, when I know my readers are often very young. The principle underlying all my books is one I learnt as a teacher. Very early on, when I was finding my voice as a storyteller in the classroom of Wickhambreaux ­Primary School, I would use the last half hour of every day to tell my Year Six class a story – either one of my own or an adaptation of some folk tale. I discovered quickly that if I wanted to keep their attention I had to mean the story, believe it and live it as I told it – and look them in the eye. Above all, I knew that I must not ever patronise them. I told my story, asked no questions ­afterwards, just let them go off home when the end-of-school bell rang, with the tale still in their heads, wondering.\nAs a teacher and a parent I did not want my stories to traumatise them. But to see them saddened, deep in thought, working out the rights and wrongs, the fair and the unfair, was important. Many would have known grief already. Some would have serious difficulties at home. I felt that the stories I was telling should not avoid the painful side of life.\nWar is part of the world into which they have been born. They know this all too well, and all too soon in their young lives, that’s for sure. The children of today come across images of war on their phones: of bombs falling, of whole towns destroyed before their eyes. They see unimaginable scenes of ­suffering in hospitals under siege. They witness families grieving over dead bodies. They hear and see stories, vividly told, of the ­consequences of war, too: the ­starvation, the disease, the drowning of migrants escaping conflict.\nI’m sure the instinct often is to switch off, or to look away, but once seen, such images are difficult to forget, and they can be deeply troubling. They are also ­unexplained to the young mind. But the young mind is endlessly inquisitive. Children want to know, to discover more of the unknown, even if it is disturbing.\n'I write about \"the pity of war\" – that's what I want to pass on to my readers, adult or child': illustration by Michael Foreman for Finding Alfie: A D-Day Story by Michael Morpurgo - Michael Foreman/Scholastic\nI have tried never to shy away from writing stories about those moments in history or in my life that have affected me deeply. A visit to Venice gave me cause to write a story, for instance, about the Holocaust. One night, walking over the Accademia Bridge, we came down into a piazza and witnessed the sublime – a street violinist playing the most exquisite music: Mozart. Then we saw a young boy of four or five, sitting some distance away on his tricycle in his pyjamas totally lost in the music. We stayed, not wanting the moment to end.\nThe next day, we walked down an alleyway into the Jewish ­quarter , from which, we discovered, more than 200 Jews had been deported to concentration camps in 1944. Very few returned. Heaven on earth it had been the night before listening with the boy to the ­violinist playing Mozart. Now here was a reminder of hell on earth.\nI wrote The Mozart Question shortly after, my story of the power of music over evil. Yes, it’s about the horror of the camps, but it’s also about the survivors, how they and their descendants deal with the enormity of the loss, and how music enriches their lives.\nThe generation before us did not look the other way. Eighty years ago, Allied troops set out from the shores of Britain, in the biggest seaborne invasion ever made, to liberate occupied Europe. At dawn on June 6 they began their landings on the beaches of Normandy. Many died on those beaches, but there was no shaking the resolve of our forefathers. They never ­surrendered, they fought on the beaches, and within a year they had defeated perhaps the worst tyranny that ever threatened mankind.\nThose beaches were not far from Dunkirk, where four years before, more than 300,000 soldiers had been picked up off the beaches by the Royal Navy and that famous armada of ­little boats and brought back to safety. A defeated army lived to fight on again another day. And that day was D-Day.\nMy new book, Finding Alfie, is a story of one of those brave ­soldiers who was there at Dunkirk in one of the little boats to help bring the army home, and four years later, was there at the ­Normandy landings.\nWilfred Owen once wrote of “the pity of war”. It is that pity I write about. That’s what I want to pass on to my readers, adult or child, wherever they live. I like to think of my stories as kites of peace flying high: stories of how the past was for those who lived it, but ever hopeful for a brighter future, ever more sure that freedom is worth ­defending, and that we should never take it for granted.",
