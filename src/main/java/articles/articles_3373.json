    "text": "Nigerian defender, Olisa Ndah, who currently plays for South African club Orlando Pirates, has expressed his openness to making a move to Europe. The 26-year-old centre-back has been a key player for Orlando since joining from Akwa United, a team in the Nigeria Professional Football League, in 2021. Ndah has helped his team win the MTN 8 League Cup in two consecutive seasons at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto. Despite his strong individual performances and consistency, a rumored transfer to Italian club Sassuolo never materialized as no official bid was made. However, Ndah remains optimistic about a potential move to Europe. He emphasized his satisfaction with his current role at Orlando Pirates but admitted he is open to new opportunities should they arise. “I’m happy where I am, but I’m open to any opportunity that comes my way,” Ndah told Goal in an interview. Ndah began his professional career in the Nigeria Professional Football League with Remo Stars during the 2018/2019 season. After 18 months, he joined Akwa United, where he won the league title. Since 2021, Ndah has been playing in South Africa with Orlando Pirates and continues to aim for a future move to Europe.",

    "text": "A controversial giant demon statue was taken down yesterday evening after months of criticism over alleged promotion of devil worship, pet sacrifices, and just being outright terrifying to some.\nThe infamous Kru Kai Kaeo statue was removed from the front of Bangkok’s The Bazaar Hotel in Huai Khwang district. The order came from the State Railway of Thailand who had asked the hotel for its removal by Saturday.\nThe hotel’s operator, Suan Lum Night Bazaar Ratchadaphisek, was ordered to pay a hefty fine of THB1.3 million for violating the Building Control Act.\nThe spot where the four-meter tall statue sat alongside its nine-tailed fox figure will be renovated into an activity area for guests, according to hotel owner Pairoj Thungthong.\nThe statue, known for its menacing glare and winged demon features, attracted so much attention from the public since it was erected in the beginning of August. It was deemed frightening by some, including a group called the “Council of Artists Promoting Buddhism” who had lobbied to have it removed, claiming it encourages people to worship demons and offer pets as sacrificial animals. Thankfully, there have been no reports indicating that either had happened at the site.\nKru Kai Kaeo, according to some believers, was said to be a teacher of former Khmer empire ruler Jayavarman VII. While some say he is a god of wealth, critics and scholars say they have never heard of him.\nAnother group called the National Thai People Council petitioned Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt to remove the statue as it posed “a threat to Thai culture and beliefs.”",

    "text": "Manchester City 2-0 Chelsea: Miedema brace hands Bompastor first defeat\nManchester City ended Chelsea's 31-game unbeaten run in all competitions to earn a two-goal lead in their Champions League quarter-final.\nVivianne Miedema played the role of super-sub by scoring twice to help Manchester City to a 2-0 win over Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\nThe result also saw Chelsea's incredible 31-game unbeaten run come to an end, while it was also the first defeat for Sonia Bompastor since she took charge of the Blues.\nCity started the stronger of the two sides, with Kerolin firing off target just after a minute had been played before Jill Roord tested visiting goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\nNick Cushing's side continued to push for the opening goal without reward in the first half, with the interim City boss turning to his bench for inspiration at half-time.\nMiedema, on to replace Lily Murphy at the break, made an instant impact and put City ahead on the hour.\nFollowing a teasing corner, Hampton produced a wonderful save to tip the ball onto the crossbar, only for Miedema to smash home the rebound into the roof of the net.\nChelsea offered little in the attacking third, but went agonisingly close to levelling the game late on when Johanna Rytting Kaneryd's strike from a tight angle rattled the crossbar, before Wieke Kaptein's effort was pushed away by goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\nAnd, with two minutes remaining, Miedema grabbed her second of the contest with another fine finish, letting the ball run across her body before placing the ball beyond the grasp of Hampton to seal an impressive first-leg triumph.\nIt leaves Chelsea with work to do in next week's second leg at Stamford Bridge as they continue their quest to win four trophies this season.\nData Debrief: The streak is over\nHeading into the game on Wednesday, Chelsea knew that avoiding defeat would set a new record for the longest ever unbeaten streak by a Women's Super League team across all competitions, but they were comfortably second best against City in the encounter.\nThough only ending the contest with an expected goals (xG) of 0.94 to Chelsea's 1.08, the Citizens looked assured in possession and limited their opponents to very little throughout, something Bompastor has yet to navigate in her tenure thus far.\nBut City were helped by the introduction of Miedema, who took the game by the scruff of its neck to drag her side to victory. She ended the contest with team-high totals for shots on target (three) and touches in the opposition box (six).\nThe result also saw Cushing exact some revenge from their League Cup final defeat, with the two sides having one game each as they prepare for their third consecutive meeting, this time in the WSL, on Sunday.",
