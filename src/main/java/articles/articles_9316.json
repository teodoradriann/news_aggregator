    "title": "Cuba llama en Mnoal a mantener la unidad y coordinar posiciones - Prensa Latina",
    "text": "Al intervenir en la jornada inaugural de la XIX Cumbre del Mnoal en Uganda, Valdés destacó que la nación caribeña, en su condición de presidente del Grupo de los 77 y China, se ha empeñado en fomentar la unidad, la solidaridad y la cooperación entre los países del Sur. «Nuestro accionar coordinado constituye una necesidad impostergable frente al orden internacional prevaleciente, profundamente injusto, excluyente y discriminatorio hacia nuestros pueblos», manifestó. En este sentido, expresó el firme rechazo de la isla a la aplicación de medidas coercitivas unilaterales impuestas contra varios Estados miembros del Movimiento. El titular reiteró además el apoyo de Cuba al derecho a la autodeterminación del pueblo del Sahara Occidental y de Puerto Rico. Durante su alocución, el vicepresidente cuestionó como Occidente puede justificar el asesinato de niños y mujeres en Gaza, el bombardeo indiscriminado de escuelas y hospitales, así como la privación del acceso a agua y alimentos. Propuso que el Mnoal emprenda una serie de acciones prácticas como la demanda, en todos los espacios posibles, del cese inmediato al fuego en Gaza y el resto de los territorios palestinos ocupados. El apoyo del bloque, agregó, al envío urgente a la Franja de Gaza de una misión de protección internacional, autorizada por la Asamblea General de la ONU, con el mandato de garantizar la seguridad y protección de la población civil y facilitar la entrega de ayuda humanitaria de emergencia. Valdés exhortó «convocar una sesión reanudada del periodo extraordinario de sesiones de emergencia de la Asamblea General de la ONU, en la que el Movimiento proponga una resolución convocando con urgencia una Conferencia de Paz bajo los auspicios de Naciones Unidas, que permita preservar los derechos inalienables del pueblo palestino». Asimismo, instó a apoyar el pronto ingreso de Palestina como Estado Miembro pleno de la ONU. El representante del país caribeño, en otro momento de su discurso, indicó que el orden global vigente se caracteriza por múltiples crisis, alta polarización social, crecientes asimetrías, conflictos geopolíticos y una marcada erosión del multilateralismo. Ante este escenario, demandó una urgente democratización del sistema de relaciones internacionales, pronunciamiento realizado por la isla durante la Cumbre del G77 y China celebrada en La Habana en septiembre del 2023. El dignatario reiteró el compromiso de Cuba con la cooperación internacional solidaria sobre la base del respeto mutuo, la ayuda desinteresada y la complementariedad. Agradeció a los integrantes del Mnoal por su posición de firme rechazo al bloqueo impuesto por Estados Unidos a la isla y a la inclusión del país caribeño en la unilateral lista de Estados patrocinadores del terrorismo. El vicepresidente felicitó a Azerbaiyán por su destacada labor frente al Mnoal y deseó éxitos a Uganda en el desempeño de su presidencia, en el trienio 2024-2026. mem/mks",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "El Gobierno recurrirá a organismos multilaterales para manifestar su molestia por los dichos del fiscal venezolano Tarek Saab , quien señaló que había agentes chilenos involucrados en secuestro y homicidio de Ronald Ojeda.\n\"Hoy día el Presidente de la República hizo mención, y vamos a trabajar en esa dirección, a que el país primero va a seguir insistiendo con Venezuela, porque Venezuela tiene compromisos en esta materia, cuando se es parte de organismos internacionales, hay acuerdos bilaterales en esta materia, hay participación en Interpol, pero vamos además a recurrir a organismos multilaterales , y en esos foros vamos a llevar el punto de vista de Chile\", sostuvo la ministra del Interior, Carolina Tohá.\nSumado a lo revelado por el Presidente Gabriel Boric, la jefa de Gabinete agregó que \"del punto de vista de cómo trabajamos en Chile, nos parece totalmente inadecuado que autoridades de Chile, o con mayor razón de otro país, planteen mediáticamente sospechas respecto a causas de esta naturaleza. Esa no es la forma seria en que se enfrenta una investigación\".\n\"Y vamos a hacer saber esa molestia de Chile , y también la exigencia a que Venezuela colabore en el hallazgo de estas personas sospechosas por todas esas vías, además de la nota de protesta\".\nSobre la colaboración venezolana, aseguró que \"siempre hemos hablado de que nosotros no nos encontramos, no somos ingenuos ni estamos relajados por el hecho de que se nos haya ofrecido colaboración. Siempre hemos dicho que vamos a estar atentos a que ello suceda, y lo vamos a exigir en todas las instancias\".\nNosotros como país tenemos la evaluación, a partir además de una trayectoria de política exterior, que la medida de romper relaciones suele prestar muy poca utilidad a los objetivos del país. Sin embargo, eso no quiere decir que nuestro único vehículo sean las notas de protesta.",
