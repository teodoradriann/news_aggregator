    "title": "Marvel's Superman Just Became the Avengers' Biggest Threat, As He Finally Gets Ambitious",
    "text": "Warning: contains spoilers for Avengers #17 Marvel's very own Superman , the Multiversal \"hero\" known as Hyperion, returns to Earth-616 as a major Avengers villain in Avengers #17 , attempting to destroy the entire planet with one monstrous punch. Mark Milton, last seen in the 2021 Heroes Reborn event , is a powerful parody of Clark Kent, whose various universal counterparts have been heroes, villains, and even an Avenger. The \"original\" Hyperion was the villainous leader of the Squadron Sinister but became better known as the righteous and just heroic leader of the Squadron Supreme , a pastiche of DC Comics' iconic Justice League that debuted in 1971's The Avengers #85.\nThe Avengers can truly never catch a break, as Hyperion's vicious assault on Earth is happening right after the deadly Blood Hunt concludes. Thankfully, Avengers #17 - from writer Jed MacKay and artist Valerio Schiti - also introduces the epic X-Men hero Storm as the world's newest Avenger, just in time for the goddess to battle Hyperion.\nSquadron Supreme\nSquadron Supreme is a group of superheroes that dates back to 1971 when they first appeared in The Avengers #85. Several characters have rotated through the team since then, but core members include Hyperion, Nighthawk, Doctor Spectrum, Whizzer, and Power Princess. Many of the members were based on the supervillains from Marvel’s Squadron Sinister.\nHyperion Has Not Been Seen In Over Two Years Mark Milton's entire existence was revealed to be fake\nThe Hyperion who reveals his plan to destroy Earth in Avengers #17 is a fascinating amalgamation of two versions of the iconic hero and has not been seen since 2022's Avengers #50. Mark Milton of Earth-616 is actually an artificial construct created and given life by the demon Mephisto , in a plan to take over the world alongside the villainous Phil Coulson. To that end, Coulson used the Pandemonium Cube to create the Heroes Reborn universe, where the Avengers didn't exist, and the Squadron Supreme were Earth's Mightiest Heroes. After the Avengers reclaimed their identities and defeated Mephisto, the heroic memories of the Heroes Reborn Hyperion were transferred to Mephisto's Hyperion simulacrum.\nMarvel's Real Superman Has A Surprising Eternals Connection\nAfter the collapse of Coulson's Squadron Supreme, the Hyperion construct was incredibly confused and conflicted, unsure of who he was or if his entire life was a lie (it was). In Avengers #50, Hyperion was shown seeking out the Red Widow, so that she could deprogram him after months of mental manipulation by Coulson and the Power Elite. Milton was last seen being \"freed\" from his brainwashing through Red Room protocols at the hands of the Red Widow. Now, an emotionally devastated Hyperion has resurfaced in Avengers #17, convinced that either his life - or Earth-616 - is a \"lie,\" prompting him to threaten a galactic murder-suicide to \"solve\" this existential problem . Clearly, whatever the Red Widow did to Hyperion may have freed him from his previous programming, but did not heal his fractured mind.\nThe Avengers Now Have Storm To Help Them Stop Hyperion The X-Men leader's first Avengers mission will be intense\nAvengers #17 sees Captain America recruiting Storm to join the Avengers once again, believing that the Avengers failed mutantkind and her representation on the team would help the mutant race, and strengthen Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Ororo is immediately thrust into a battle for the fate of planet Earth, as Hyperion announces his intention to destroy the world right after she accepts her new role as an Avenger. Hyperion has defeated all the Avengers at one point or another. Still, he has never faced the Omega-level might of Storm , a goddess and mutant fighter who will give the powerful super-being a run for his money.\nHyperion is not pure evil, instead, he is a broken and scared man who can't get over the fact that his entire life was built on a demonic lie . Hopefully, Storm of the Avengers will be able to stop Hyperion without needing to kill him, instead showing him the error of his ways and setting him on a more heroic path once again.\nAvengers #17 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.\nComics Avengers Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",

    "title": "Centuries-old Masjid in Ganberbal crumbling, locals demand renovation - DailyExcelsior",
    "text": "Suhail Bhat SRINAGAR, Dec 28: A 17th-century Mughal-era Masjid in the Malshahi Bagh area of Ganderbal district is currently in a state of disrepair, prompting locals to call for its immediate renovation to safeguard this invaluable historical asset. Despite being designated as a protected monument in 2021 due to its cultural and historical significance, the Masjid has not seen improvements in its condition and continues to deteriorate. Known locally as the Jinn Masjid, it was built by Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shahjahan, for his spiritual mentor and saint Mullah Shah Badakhshi. However, the monument now requires urgent attention, having developed cracks over centuries of exposure to snow and rain. The lack of proper oversight has turned the Masjid into a haven for anti-social elements, as per locals, even though it falls under the care of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board. The locals alleged that the Muslim body has been unable to maintain this architectural gem, and the Masjid’s condition worsens day by day. “We urge the Government to preserve this culturally significant mosque,” Noor Mohammad, a local, said. [Click here to watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km6a845cByU) He said that the Masjid is located within a 360-kanal apple, plum, and walnut orchard, and while the Wakf gladly accepts returns from the orchard, it appears to be indifferent to the upkeep of this heritage site, “We have brought up the issue with the Wakf Board several times, but no action has been taken so far,” he said. Locals attribute the delayed renovation of the mosque to the laid-back attitude of the Waqf Board. “During our visit to the Waqf Board, they informed us that the Masjid is under the jurisdiction of another department. Although their officials visited the site and issued tenders for the renovation project, the Awqaf is still sitting on it,” a local said. The Chairperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board, Darakshan Andrabi, clarified that the Masjid has been declared a protected monument and falls under the purview of the Archaeological Survey of India. “We cannot undertake the renovation independently; otherwise, we would have already done so. While we are aware of the condition of the Masjid, we share the community’s desire for its preservation,” she said.",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren - Victoria Times Colonist",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "California Dairy⁣ Farmers​ Face ‘Covid for Cows’ as Bird Flu⁤ Spreads Sacramento,CA – California’s dairy industry is ​facing⁤ a crisis⁣ as ​a highly contagious strain of⁤ bird flu rips through poultry flocks,leaving farmers struggling ⁤to contain ‍the outbreak and protect their ⁤livelihoods. The‌ situation has⁣ become so dire that some are calling it “Covid for cows,” drawing parallels⁤ to the devastating ⁣impact the pandemic had on human health and⁣ the economy.\n“it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said ‍john ⁢Smith, ⁤a third-generation dairy farmer in Tulare County, one of⁣ the hardest-hit areas. “We’re losing birds​ at an alarming rate, ⁣and ⁢the fear is‌ palpable. It’s not just about the financial losses; it’s about the ‍emotional toll this is⁤ taking on everyone involved.”\nThe highly pathogenic avian ⁤influenza (HPAI) virus,frist detected in the U.S.‍ in early 2022, has spread‌ rapidly across the country,⁤ infecting ⁣millions of‍ birds and leading​ to the‌ culling of entire flocks to prevent further spread. California, a major egg and poultry producer,⁣ has been notably hard hit, with ​over 1.2 million birds affected.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom ​has declared a state of ‍emergency, mobilizing resources‌ to support affected farmers and mitigate the economic‌ fallout.The declaration allows for expedited procurement of supplies and personnel,as well as access to federal funding.\n“We are taking this threat very seriously,” said‍ Newsom in a statement. “Our top priority is to ​protect the health ⁢of Californians and support our agricultural community⁢ during this challenging time.”\nThe ⁣outbreak has ‌raised concerns⁣ about potential impacts ​on egg and poultry ‍prices, ⁣as well as the ‌availability of these products in grocery stores. While officials​ say ⁢there is no immediate ‍threat to human health, they urge consumers to practise good hygiene and cook poultry thoroughly.\nThe situation remains fluid, with the ​virus continuing to spread.Farmers are working​ tirelessly to implement biosecurity measures and protect their flocks, while researchers race to ⁣develop ​a‌ vaccine.The coming‌ weeks​ will be crucial in determining the long-term ⁣impact of⁤ this avian flu outbreak on California’s​ dairy‍ industry and the nation’s food supply.\n[Image: A dairy farmer wearing protective gear walks through a barn, looking concerned.]\n[Image: A map of California highlighting the counties most affected by the bird flu outbreak.]\n“Covid for Cows?” California Dairy Farmers Face⁤ Devastating Bird Flu Outbreak [Anchor Int.] Joining us today is Dr. Emily Carter, a veterinarian and ⁣avian flu specialist with the University of‌ California, Davis.Dr. Carter, thank ⁤you for joining us.\n[Dr. Carter] Thank you for having‍ me.\n[Anchor Int.] This⁢ bird‍ flu outbreak is ⁣being ‍called “Covid for​ cows” by⁤ some. Can you elaborate on why this situation is causing such alarm in the dairy industry?\n[Dr. Carter] While the virus doesn’t directly infect cows, the ripple effect is significant. The outbreak is devastating poultry farms, leading to massive ⁢culls and disruptions in the egg and poultry supply chains.This directly impacts feed​ costs for⁣ dairy farmers, as they rely on byproducts from the poultry industry. The‌ fear is that these increased⁤ costs will lead to financial hardship for dairy​ farmers, much like what we saw during the pandemic with supply chain disruptions and price​ fluctuations.\n[Anchor Int.] How​ widespread is the outbreak in California, and what measures are being taken to contain it?\n[Dr.Carter] ‌ The outbreak is unfortunately ⁤quite widespread, significantly impacting major poultry-producing counties in Central Valley.The state has declared a state of emergency,mobilizing resources ​to support affected farmers and mitigate the economic fallout. Biosecurity measures are being implemented on farms, ‌ and researchers are working tirelessly to develop a vaccine.\n[Anchor Int.] What can consumers expect in terms of potential impacts on egg and poultry prices, and are there any concerns about human health risks?\n[Dr. Carter] ​Its likely we’ll see price increases for eggs and poultry products ‍as supply dwindles. However, officials emphasize that there ⁣is no immediate threat to human health from this strain. ​As always, it’s crucial to practice ⁢good hygiene, cook poultry thoroughly, and follow any guidance from ‍public health authorities.\n[Anchor Int.] Dr.‌ Carter,‍ thank you for ‌shedding light on this ​critical situation. ‌We certainly ⁣hope for a swift resolution to this outbreak ​and support for the farmers⁢ who are being affected.\n[Dr. Carter] Thank you⁣ for having me.",
