    "title": "Met Office issues yellow weather warning to parts of Essex as delays 'likely'",
    "text": "Parts of Essex will face disruption due to strong winds over the weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning from Saturday morning (December 30) through to the early hours of Sunday (December 31), with transport likely to be affected. The strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services. This will affect the coastal areas of Essex including Southend-on-Sea, Thurrock, Clacton and Burnham-on-Crouch, as well as places like Chelmsford and Colchester. The Met Office estimates that the adverse conditions will begin on Saturday morning at around 11am, and continue until 3am on Sunday. There may be delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport as a result of the winds.

Some bus and train services may be affected, with journeys taking longer, and delays are likely for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Driving in these conditions can be dangerous, so anyone getting by behind the wheel this weekend should follow the advice issued by the Met Office. This includes driving slowly to minimise the impact of wind gusts, holding the steering wheel firmly and giving cyclists, motorcyclists, lorries and buses more room than usual. Measures can also be taken to avoid causing damage to people or your property. Items like bins, plant pots and garden furniture should be secure or else taken inside your home during the period of heavy winds.",

En un apunte en 'X' recogido por Europa Press, el también candidato de Junts a presidir la Generalitat ha dicho que \"con exiliados, encarcelados y perseguidos no puede hacerse política en igualdad de condiciones\", y que mientras eso dure no existirá ninguna normalidad. Ha reivindicado que el regreso de Rovira, Wagensberg, Serra, Rodríguez y Campmajó, \"perseguidos por la gran farsa judicial que ha sido el caso 'Tsunami\", es una gran alegría, si bien ha advertido de que aún se está lejos de la normalidad política. \"Todavía estamos lejos de tener las condiciones que nos permitan hacer política con la normalidad a la que tenemos derecho, no sólo personalmente, sino sobre todo como pueblo\", ha remarcado Puigdemont. También ha deseado a los cinco que puedan recuperar estos años y meses que considera que les han sido robados, y les ha emplazado a volver al trabajo lo antes posible, ya que \"hay mucho pendiente\". - item no encontrado",

    "title": "Redefining Success with Jean Louise Hardy: A New Paradigm in Business Consulting – Daily Scanner",
    "text": "In the field of business consulting and personal development, there exists a great man whose journey encapsulates the essence of change and wisdom: Jean Louise Hardy. A self-proclaimed “high-performance minimalist” and “biblical entrepreneur,”\nhardy's The odyssey is not just about gathering followers or achieving personal success. It is a more profound calling, a mission to elevate entrepreneurs to ICON status, sharing their wealth of knowledge and experience in the alchemy of business philosophy wisdom. This conversation explores Hardy's unique approach, his hyper mindset, and his approach to redefining success in the consulting field.\nCan you elaborate on your philosophy of being a “high-performance minimalist” and a “biblical entrepreneur”?\nMy philosophy combines simplicity with effectiveness, focusing on the core elements that drive performance and success. As a “high-performance minimalist”, I believe in eliminating unnecessary things to focus on what really matters, thereby increasing productivity and achieving goals with accuracy. The “Biblical Entrepreneur” aspect of my philosophy integrates spiritual knowledge and ethical practices into business, advocating a path that is not only profitable but also righteous and fulfilling.\nWhat inspired you to develop the HiPer mindset and how does it integrate into your consulting approach?\nHyper Mindset was born from my journey through adversity and the realization that mindset is the foundation of achievement. It is a framework that combines an entrepreneurial vision with a deep belief in one's ability. This mindset is not just about manifesting destiny; It is a strategic amalgamation of focus, flexibility and ethical foundation. In my consulting practice, it serves as a compass, guiding clients through the difficult journey of business development, helping them discover their true potential and transform challenges into milestones.\nYou place a lot of emphasis on trust. How do you overcome trust-related challenges in your professional relationships?\nTrust is the cornerstone of any lasting relationship, be it personal or professional. My experiences, especially the challenges related to mental health and self-worth when trust was broken, have taught me the importance of building and maintaining trust. In dealing with these challenges, I emphasize transparency, consistency, and empathy, ensuring that my actions align with my words. This approach has been vital in establishing a foundation of trust with my clients, facilitating mutual growth and the journey to success.\nCan you share any extraordinary success stories from your consulting practice?\nOne of the most rewarding experiences was turning a struggling mobile store into a seven-figure business within a year. This endeavor epitomizes the power of the Hyper Mindset, where strategic planning, sustained focus and a deep understanding of customer needs came together to create a success story. It was not just about financial gain; It was about proving that with the right mindset and guidance, any business can overcome adversity and achieve greatness.\nBalancing work and family life is a topic you've discussed. How do you manage this balance, and what lessons have you learned?\nBalancing my professional ambitions and family responsibilities has been one of my biggest challenges. It is a dynamic process of trial and error, learning to prioritize, delegate and most importantly accepting that perfection is an illusion. The main lesson is the importance of being present. Whether it's a business meeting or a family dinner, giving my full attention to that moment enriches both my work and personal life.\nLooking ahead, what are your aspirations to expand your consulting reach globally?\nMy vision is to transcend geographical boundaries and influence entrepreneurs around the world, transforming businesses and lives through the principles of the Hyper Mindset. By leveraging digital platforms and fostering a global community of like-minded individuals, my goal is to share my insights and strategies to help others navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship and achieve their full potential.\nJean-Louis Hardy's journey from overcoming personal adversity to becoming an icon of business wisdom is a testament to the transformative power of resilience, wisdom and the right mindset. His unique blend of minimalism, spiritual integrity and strategic insight offers a new paradigm in business consulting that aims not only at financial success but also at enriching lives and leaving a lasting legacy.\nSource: www.dailyscanner.com",

    "text": "The latest version of the open-source lightweight window manager, compositor, and desktop shell has arrived with plenty of improvements and features.\nAfter all these years, it's hard to believe that Enlightenment has yet to reach version 1, but for those who enjoy a unique and configurable desktop, a new release has become available.\nVersion 0.26.0 was treated to several bug fixes. The developers' primary goal was to bring more stability to the desktop to improve the user experience. However, along for the ride, a few new features did slip into the mix.\nThose features include the addition of a Display Data Channel (DDC) setting for backlight configurations to enhance screen brightness, bigger task previews and improved open application overview, a watermark for Window Manager Mode (so the user will know when the desktop is running in the experimental wl mode, support for file action in EFM (Enlightenment File Manager), support added for the logind lock/unlock Dbus APIs, and more.\nAnother important addition focuses on settings security. By adding support for the new eet disk sync API, Enlightenment settings all configurations are stored properly and more securely.\nTo improve performance, a new watchdog thread was added (and enabled by default), to manage mainloop hangs. This should go a long way to improving system reliability.\nAlthough this release doesn't introduce any game-changing features, everything does come together to create a more responsible, reliable, and performant desktop.\nIf you're a fan of Enlightenment, you should enjoy this point release. However, don't expect it to hit your favorite distribution repository immediately. This release depends on EFL version 1.27.0 or later, which means you'll have to build Enlightenment 0.26.0 manually.\nTo read more about the latest release, check out the official notes from the development team .\nRelated content Elive 1.9.22 Ecomorphs Compiz with Enlightenment In theory, Compiz effects should not work under Enlightenment.

    "text": "Major winter storm set to deliver this winter’s most significant blow yet Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist Sat, January 4, 2025 at 11:43 AM UTC 5 min read\nA major winter storm will deliver heavy snow, hazardous ice, rain and severe thunderstorms to more than 1,300 miles of the United States over the weekend and into next week.\nSnow and ice so far this winter in the eastern two-thirds of the country have been limited to northern states. But this storm will break that mold and bring treacherous conditions to millions from the Plains to the East Coast, including in areas less prone to winter weather.\nAnd where it’s too warm for snow and ice, the storm could conjure up severe thunderstorms, including in some of the same areas still recovering from December’s deadly storms .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Major impacts, including “considerable disruptions to daily life … dangerous or impossible driving conditions and widespread closures,” are expected from this storm through Sunday in parts of the Central US, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index.\nIt all starts on Saturday afternoon when the storm develops in the Plains, fueled by a deep surge of moist air moving north out of the Gulf of Mexico. It will start to spread snow, rain and an icy mix over the Plains late in the day as it strengthens and expands.\nFrom there it will track east and spread a wintry mess into the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Midwest by Sunday morning. The storm will expand into the Ohio Valley and Southeast Sunday and to the East Coast Sunday night and Monday.\nThe regions at greatest risk are clear, but exactly who gets snow, ice or mainly rain — and how much — is still incredibly difficult to determine. Small shifts in the storm’s track could change the outcomes entirely. Some areas could start as snow but change over to an icy mix as warmer air enters the area, while other spots start as rain or an icy mix and gradually change over to snow.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement This storm will be capable of unleashing more than a foot of snow and enough ice to knock out power just as the coldest temperatures of the season arrive in its wake.\nSnow will bury some areas The storm will lay down several inches of snow from late Saturday through Monday in a stripe that stretches from parts of Kansas and Nebraska to the East Coast.\nThe highest snow totals will rack up in the coldest areas, likely in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Totals will be lower in areas where warmer air generates sleet and ice instead of snow.\nSt. Louis has only seen four days where more than a foot of snow fell in a day — a feat that could happen Sunday. Snow totals could range from an inch to more than a foot in parts of Missouri, depending on the storm’s exact track. This could also be the case for the other states with the greatest chances of snow.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Ice-T calls cop a ‘f–king a–hole’ during tense exchange caught on bodycam video: ‘This muthaf–ka’ NY Post Major winter storm to bring blizzard conditions this weekend; See forecast, snowfall maps USA TODAY 'There's nothing else we can do': Stranded Lake Michigan boat could be stuck for months Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Soldier Left Note Explaining Why He Turned a Cybertruck Into a Suicide Bomb The Daily Beast Unlike during other storms this winter, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Upstate New York could receive little-to-no snow because of the storm’s more southerly track. Some lake-effect snow is possible in Michigan and New York as the wind direction shifts both before and after the storm.\nTreacherous ice to come The greatest risk of dangerous ice will set up just south of the snowiest areas. Significant icing is possible from Kansas and Missouri through the central Appalachians and potentially parts of Maryland and Delaware.\nTravel could be “nearly impossible” in the areas of heaviest icing, multiple National Weather Service offices warned.\nIce amounts of 0.25 inches or more are possible, especially in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and almost all of Kentucky.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer – a light glaze to just over 0.10 inches – can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control.\nA car slides around a corner amid snow in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday. Scenes like this will be playing out across the eastern two-thirds of the US once a major winter storm hits over the weekend. - Cody Scanlan/The Register/USA Today Network/Imagn Images The thicker the ice, the worse its impact. Heavy ice – 0.25 inches or more – weighs down trees and power lines and can snap branches or pull down electrical wires. Large amounts of ice could also completely immobilize travel by making roads impassable.\nAn ice storm that slammed the Central US in January of last year knocked out power to thousands and sent first responders spinning out of control as they tried to reach people in distress.\nPower outages could be widespread and long-lasting if significant icing occurs and power restoration crews can’t navigate treacherous roads. That situation could be dangerous or potentially deadly for those without access to heat in the extreme cold to come.\nDamaging thunderstorms and soaking rain The southern, warmer side of the storm will spread rain and some embedded thunderstorms over much of the South. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, especially on Sunday afternoon.\nAdvertisement Advertisement A level 3 of 5 threat of severe thunderstorms is in place Sunday for parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\nDamaging wind gusts and hail are the most likely threats from any severe thunderstorm but tornadoes are also possible. A tornado outbreak , including multiple rated EF3s, rocked parts of the South in late December.\nDamage in the aftermath of severe thunderstorms in Porter Heights, Texas, on December 28, 2024. - The Woodlands Fire Department Rain and storms could also cause flooding, especially where the heaviest rain falls in the Southeast.\nThe massive storm will finally exit the East Coast late Monday and fully diminish in impact overnight.\nBut Tuesday presents a new problem: Arctic cold. Temperatures will plunge as much as 30 degrees below normal for the eastern two-thirds of the US and the frigid air will last for some into at least the middle of January, locking in whatever snow and ice fall from the storm.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 26,064 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "The majority of rockets today are liquid-powered, using both a fuel and an oxidizer.\nSpaceX fuels its rockets with methane or refined kerosene and the oxidizer is liquid oxygen.\nThe BioRocket Team at the University of Calgary is looking at substituting the fuel with diesel, ethanol or sustainable aviation fuel.\nNitrous oxide will act as the oxidizer.\n\"The nitrous basically lets it burn,\" said Lukas Kobler, BioRocket project manager.\n\"So, if you think, like, a can of hairspray on a lighter, that's what the oxidizer is doing. It's making the flame a lot bigger, a lot more powerful.\"\nKobler says rocket engines being reused now changes the cost structure of the process.\n\"Up until recently, the majority of the cost of launching a rocket was the rocket itself, because we would fly these rockets and we would dispose of them,\" he said.\n\"Now, though, we're looking at reusable rockets. So now, that cost balance is flipping and the cost is the propellants, so it's becoming more and more important to use fuels that are sustainable, affordable in the long run.\"\nRimoon Koryal, the manufacturing lead and in his final year of mechanical engineering, says biofuels will perform.\n\"They have the same energy density, so we're not losing too much performance,\" he said.\n\"However, we're cutting down carbon emissions, and overall environmental impact is a lot more minimized using biofuels compared to fossil fuels.\"\nThe task started in September and the students have eight months to complete it.\nIt's their capstone design project required to graduate.\n\"The capstone can give you professional experience while still being in school,\" Koryal said.\n\"It's a key point for when you're applying outside of university, you can say that you worked and collaborated with teammates. There's little academic involvement, so the professors are there to check up with you but mainly, it's your discretion on how you want to proceed.\"\nJayden Sorensen, the controls and electronics lead and in her final year of electrical engineering, says this is a chance for her to apply what she's learned over the past five years.\n\"Everything that I've learned thus far in my degree is coming together in this project,\" she said.\n\"I really have to reach into every single thing that I've done, internships, every course. It's all coming together on this project, which is awesome.\"\nAll the team members have years of experience working on the university's Student Organization for Aerospace Research team (SOAR), which recently won an international competition in its division at the Intercollegiate Rocket Competition in New Mexico.\nThat rocket is powered by a hybrid system with a solid fuel and liquid oxidizer combination.\n\"I feel like SOAR has been boot camp for this project,\" Sorensen said.\n\"I learned so much about how to integrate multidisciplinary systems and work under high-pressure environments and this capstone feels like the ultimate test of everything I've learned through my degree and through SOAR.\"\nThe team is building a rocket around its biofuelled engine and hopes to launch in spring 2025.\nIt's important that all the systems in the rocket \"talk\" to each other and that task falls on Jesse Gerbrandt, in his final year of software engineering.\n\"We have to do the control GUI and that's basically the interface,\" he said.\n\"It has all the sensor data on it, all the controls, all our valves and then all the onboard avionics have to actually control the engine, the pressure control, essentially how it works is we set a target pressure and then in software, it controls based on what the current pressure is versus that target pressure.\"\nHe's confident the team can build and fly a rocket.\n\"I think it's just, like, some of the most incredible engineering out there,\" Gerbrandt said.\n\"It's super inspiring to me that that can be done, and I could potentially have a part in it.\"\nKobler says at the least, the team wants to be able to fire their biofuel rocket engine.\n\"But we are designing a rocket around the motor, and we would like to fly that rocket,\" he said.\n\"We want to show that this propellant combination is viable and if it is, then it could potentially be scaled up and there's various applications for this kind of technology.\"\nYou can learn more about the team at biorocket.ca .",
