    "title": "Team prepares to take aid to Ukraine in ambulances",
    "text": "A team of “ordinary people from Suffolk” is preparing to embark on a trip to war-torn Ukraine in a fleet of second-hand ambulances. John Nickell-Lean, 72, and Dr Janee Miller OBE, 61, are making the journey with six other people as part of a mission to deliver vital aid. The team raised almost £43,000 to buy four former NHS vehicles as well as the medical essentials they will be transporting. Mr Nickell-Lean, from Southwold, said: &quot;The people of Ukraine are fighting an extremely difficult situation and, for me, sitting on the sidelines was not the most exciting thing to do.&quot; He added: &quot;One of my friends from Yorkshire told me about someone who had taken ambulances to Ukraine. &quot;I thought this sounded like a really good way to help so I set up a little charitable fund. The ambulances are in remarkably good order and it means we can get out there and back for well under £10,000 a vehicle, which is amazing.&quot; Several residential areas were hit in Russia&#039;s attack on Kharkiv last month Dr Miller, who was born in Moscow, decided to get involved after feeling helpless while watching the war unfold from her home in Southwold. She said: &quot;Russia has always been close to my heart but after the invasion I felt very frustrated that I could not do anything. &quot;Then John came along a couple of months ago and said he wanted to do something and I said ‘me too’ - it was as simply as that. “There is a lot of people who have really put their heart and soul into supporting this and we are really grateful for that.&quot; Due to the ongoing conflict, UK residents are advised by the UK government against visiting any parts of Ukraine. Southwold&#039;s John Nickell-Lean and Janee Miller (middle) will be taking vital aid to Ukraine alongside six other helpers Mr Nickell-Lean and Dr Miller acknowledge the dangers posed by the trip but said they were &quot;going into this with our eyes wide open&quot;. &quot;God forbid if something did happen, my view is it is actually better it happens like that then getting knocked over by a car trying to get into Sainsbury’s,&quot; Mr Nickell-Lean said. &quot;There is an element of risk but we are being entirely sensible about it.&quot; Follow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "title": "Calera improves to 2-0 in area play as boys, girls soccer teams shut out Chilton County - Shelby County Reporter | Shelby County Reporter",
    "text": "By ANDREW SIMONSON | Sports Editor\nCALERA – The Calera Eagles are halfway home in area play, and through two of their four matches, both the boys and girls are 2-0 against Class 6A, Area 5 competition.\nCalera secured a pair of shutouts against the Chilton County Tigers as the varsity boys picked up a 4-0 win while the girls won by mercy rule with a 10-0 score line on Tuesday, March 18 at the Eagle Sports Complex in Calera.\nThe games also took on a special meaning as they were the first varsity sports games to take place in Calera since a tornado touched down in the city on Saturday, March 15.\nFor the boys, it was a bit of a slow start offensively as neither team could break through into the opposing net in the first half. That meant the game went into the halftime break with the score tied at 0-0 and the outcome hanging in the balance.\nThe Eagles wasted little time making sure that they would be victorious this time.\nIn the 42nd minute, Edson Gonzalez sent a ball over to Alex Garcia, and he fired the shot home into the goal for the game’s opening score.\nJust one minute later, Calera struck again. This time, it was Mario Portillo who provided service to Alex Montoya as the pair linked up for the second goal in the first three minutes of the half, turning a 0-0 game at the break into a 2-0 lead for the Eagles in the 43rd minute.\nThose two goals were all Calera needed to secure the victory as it locked down the defensive end of the pitch and didn’t allow any goals en route to the clean sheet. However, the Eagles weren’t content with just two and doubled up their lead before the full-time whistle blew.\nArmando Perez chipped in on both goals with assists with the first coming in the 55th minute. That was when he found Matthew Doerfler and allowed the senior midfielder to join the scoring party and build out a commanding 3-0 lead.\nThe Eagles struck once more in the final minutes of the game as Perez connected a pass to Gonzalez, and he sent the shot home into the net to finish off the 4-0 victory.\nAs for the girls, they had even more success on offense as they secured a 10-0 victory.\nCalera got off to a strong start to the match thanks to five different goals in the first 40 minutes. That gave the Eagles a 5-0 lead at the break, but it was only the start of big things to come.\nCalera continued pressing on the offensive end of the pitch and kept finding the back of the net to increase the advantage. In the end, the Eagles matched their first-half scoring output, finishing off the win with five more goals to trigger the mercy rule ahead of the 80-minute mark.\nThe Colliers fueled the offensive onslaught all night long as Brianna and Reece Collier combined for nine goals in the victory. Brianna finished the match with five goals on the night while Reece added in four goals of her own as the pair almost single-handedly pushed the Eagles to the win.\nJackie Martinez joined in the fun with a goal of her own as Calera eclipsed the double-digit mark and finished off the clean sheet.\nWith the wins, both the boys and girls teams are 7-3-1 on the season. The boys will continue their stretch of three matches in three days when they take on the Homewood Patriots on Wednesday, March 19 at 6 p.m. before both the boys and girls face county rival Montevallo.\nThat match with the Bulldogs will take place on Thursday, March 20 at Theron Fisher Stadium with the girls kicking off at 5 p.m. and the boys starting at 7 p.m.",

    "title": "Abington couple convicted in waterboarding incident while disciplining child",
    "text": "NORRISTOWN — An Abington Township couple were convicted of conspiring in a scheme to discipline the woman’s 11-year-old daughter with a waterboarding technique that impeded the child’s ability to breathe.\n“They tried to waterboard me. I didn’t know what was happening. I couldn’t breathe. I was scared,” the girl, now 12, testified on Wednesday during the trial of her mother and stepfather in Montgomery County Court.\nThe girl, who most recently resided with her biological father in the Pottstown area, described for a judge that her mother, Aubrey Ott, instructed her to lean her head face up over a sink and then covered her face with a rag, pinched her nose and poured water over the cloth. The girl testified she believed she was being disciplined after the couple accused her of telling a lie.\nThe girl’s younger sister testified that before witnessing her mother take the victim into the bathroom and closing the door she overheard her stepfather, Gordon Ott, tell Aubrey, “This is what we did in the war.” Aubrey Ott, according to the child’s testimony, responded, “OK, I’ll do it.”\nBoth girls testified that the following morning, Aubrey Ott told them to “just forget what happened last night.”\nAfter hearing the testimony during the one day nonjury trial, Judge Steven T. O’Neill convicted Aubrey Ott, 38, of the 2300 block of Patton Road, of charges of strangulation blocking nose and mouth, endangering the welfare of a child, simple assault and conspiracy to commit those crimes in connection with the April 2024 incident.\nO’Neill, acting as sole factfinder, convicted Gordon Ott, 42, of charges of conspiracy to commit strangulation, conspiracy endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy to engage in simple assault.\n“I did weigh credibility. I found the commonwealth’s witnesses were credible,” O’Neill said as he announced his verdict.\nThe Otts showed no emotion as the verdict was announced.\nThe father of the girls and other friends and relatives appeared relieved by the verdict. Several members of Bikers Against Child Abuse Montgomery County attended the trial to support the victim and her family.\nO’Neill deferred sentencing so that court officials can complete a background investigation report about the Otts. The couple remains free on bail pending sentencing hearings later this year. The couple potentially could face jail time.\nThe incident occurred on April 29, 2024, while the victim and her sister were on a weekend visit with their mother and stepfather, according to a criminal complaint filed by Abington Detective Jeffrey Anderson.\nThe victim told her father about the incident when she returned home the next day, and her father notified police.\n“(Aubrey Ott) knew exactly what she was doing. She knew this was a torture technique used in war. She impeded this child’s ability to breathe. Clearly, when you’re using a known technique used in war you are endangering your child,” Assistant District Attorney Anne Caitlyn O’Connell argued during her closing statement to the judge, maintaining Gordon Ott also was culpable for instructing his wife what to do.\n“There was a clear verbal agreement here. They had an agreement. She carried out the crime,” O’Connell argued.\nWhen Aubrey Ott testified in her own defense, she denied disciplining her daughter with a waterboarding technique. She claimed she “nicely” took her daughter into the bathroom and used water, soap and a towel to rub ink marker stains off of the girl’s face. Other than perhaps her daughter not liking that she was scrubbing too hard, Aubrey said her daughter was “fine” and was not crying.\nAubrey Ott claimed the alleged conversation with her husband about the “war technique” never occurred.\nGordon Ott did not testify during the trial.\nDefense lawyer Anthony J. Petrone, who represented Aubrey, and defense lawyer Richard J. Giuliani, who represented Gordon, argued prosecutors did not present sufficient evidence to support the charges against their clients.\n“There is a clear, reasonable doubt. This is a caring mother. This is not a mother endangering her child by any means,” Petrone argued on behalf of Aubrey Ott.\n“It’s ridiculous. It doesn’t make sense,” Giuliani added on behalf of Gordon Ott. “It’s completely bizarre.”\nO’Connell argued the children were credible and had no reason to fabricate the incident.\nThe defense lawyers also presented testimony from character witnesses who claimed the couple had a reputation for being peaceful and law-abiding.\nIn a criminal complaint, detectives claimed the children also described various other forms of punishment, including having to perform Army planks and drink hot sauce. However, those allegations were not brought forth during the trial, which focused solely on the waterboarding incident.",
