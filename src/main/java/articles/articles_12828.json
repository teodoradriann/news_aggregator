    "text": "Falta de neve está a ameaçar a sobrevivência das estâncias de esqui na Europa Alterações climáticas estão a provocar granizo e chuvas fortes, mas não neva. Há estâncias de esqui na Europa sem capacidade para funcionar em pleno. Atletas querem mais acção climática. As estâncias de esqui estão a sofrer as consequências das [alterações climáticas](https://www.publico.pt/2023/08/18/azul/noticia/viver-alteracoes-climaticas-tempo-real-2060609), com a chuva e o granizo a substituir a queda de neve nos destinos turísticos mais procurados na Europa. É a confirmação de um aviso que surgiu num estudo publicado em Agosto pela [revista Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01759-5#author-information), de que 53% das 28 estâncias europeias investigadas pelos cientistas estavam em risco muito elevado de registar uma escassez de neve caso a temperatura média global aumente 2 graus Celsius em relação aos níveis pré-industriais. O [turismo de neve nos Alpes](https://www.publico.pt/2023/09/21/fugas/noticia/estancia-esqui-encerra-permanentemente-falta-neve-alpes-franceses-2064033), por exemplo, está avaliado em mais de 27 mil milhões de euros, mas o mercado deve registar uma quebra este ano, conta um artigo do [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/26/ski-resorts-battle-for-a-future-as-snow-declines-in-climate-crisis). Duas estâncias de esqui em França, em Morzine e Les Gets, só puderam abrir na totalidade a 23 de Dezembro, dois dias antes do Natal e a época onde se regista uma maior afluência de turistas — tudo porque [choveu intensamente nos últimos dias](https://www.publico.pt/2023/06/28/azul/noticia/chuva-vai-ameaca-maior-montanhas-aquecimento-global-2054853), mas nevou pouco. A queda de pequenas quantidades de neve pode ser suficiente para manter em funcionamento algumas estâncias de esqui mais pequenas, mas pode [ficar aquém da neve necessária em estâncias com pistas maiores](https://www.publico.pt/2023/01/06/azul/noticia/janeiro-quente-so-neve-artificial-mantem-esqui-vivo-partes-suica-2034011). A produção artificial de neve traz dificuldades acrescidas por ser mais cara, consumir muita energia e muita água, refere a notícia do diário britânico. Com ela, a quantidade de estâncias europeias com risco elevada de perda de cobertura de neve desce para metade (27%) com um aumento da temperatura média global de 2ºC acima dos níveis pré-industriais. Mas o consumo de água pode ser nove vezes superior até 2100 nos Alpes franceses. Os atletas profissionais estão preocupados com o impacto das alterações climáticas nas estâncias, que podem a afectar 98% dos espaços analisados no [estudo da Nature](https://www.publico.pt/2023/08/29/azul/noticia/crise-climatica-vai-dificultar-futuro-50-estacoes-esqui-europeias-2061549) caso a temperatura média global aumente 4ºC em relação aos níveis pré-industriais. Segundo a [NBC News](https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/alpine-skiing-climate-change-world-cup-schedule), uma carta assinada por 500 atletas de desportos da neve em Fevereiro pediu à Federação Internacional de Esqui uma maior actuação contra as alterações climáticas. Mais tarde, em Outubro, mais de 35 mil pessoas assinaram uma petição com o mesmo apelo. São críticas que chegam já depois de Gian Franco Kasper, presidente da Federação, ter sido demitido e substituído por Johan Eliasch que foi criticado por ser negacionista no que diz respeito às alterações climáticas causadas pelo homem. O autor da petição, Dom Winter, da Protect our Winters UK, defendeu que a redução do aquecimento global pode evitar o desaparecimento da neve nas estâncias utilizadas para a prática de desporto — embora se continue a correr o risco de se tornarem \"elitistas\". \"Certamente que, com 2ºC [de aquecimento global], os resorts de altitude mais baixa estariam em grandes apuros. Ainda haverá lugares com neve natural nos Alpes e os resorts em altitudes mais elevadas podem sobreviver. A preocupação é quão cara se pode tornar esta opção\", alertou, citado pelo [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/26/ski-resorts-battle-for-a-future-as-snow-declines-in-climate-crisis).",

    "title": "The Chicago Mayor's Hat Trick Of Dreadful Policies | ZeroHedge",
    "text": "The Chicago Mayor's Hat Trick Of Dreadful Policies [Authored by Charles Lipson via The Epoch Times](https://realclearwire.com/articles/2023/12/27/the_chicago_mayors_hat_trick_of_dreadful_policies_150250.html) (emphasis ours), When your city elects a mayor whose main job qualification is “organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union,” you get what you paid for, or rather what the powerful CTU paid for. With Mayor Brandon Johnson, you get a special bonus, an unwelcome one. His proposed policies are unworkable, unaffordable, and deeply unpopular in the city that elected him less than a year ago. Three policies stand out for particular ridicule. Mayor Johnson wants to: Start city-owned and -operated groceries in some underserved areas. The government that wants to take on these difficult new tasks is already failing at such basic services as fixing potholes and policing dangerous neighborhoods. Ticket the buses bringing illegal immigrants to Chicago, mostly from Texas. He calls them “rogue buses” because they are not “coordinating” with the city. Giving them a ticket or even impounding the vehicles is his solution. The bus companies’ own solution is to drop off the passengers in the suburbs, which immediately send them to Chicago. Johnson then rages at the Texas governor and never mentions President Biden. Close down all the selective-enrollment (magnet) schools in Chicago, the only ones where students actually read above grade level. If we judge by the likely outcome, Johnson’s policy is really designed to drive middle-class families with kids out of the city. The teachers union backs the plan, enthusiastically. They must know how good the other schools are since the president of the CTU sends her own child to a private school. Meanwhile, she is working with Gov. JB Pritzker to kill school choice for everyone else. The local joke about Mayor Johnson is that his only success has been to lower the price of downtown Chicago real estate. How do voters like Johnson’s ideas and his administration? Not much, it turns out. His poll numbers are roughly the same as those for used car salesmen with loud suits and back lots filled with rusting clunkers. The mayor’s erstwhile supporters have abandoned him. Except for the Chicago Teachers Union. The CTU is easily the most powerful union in Illinois and, most likely, the strongest local teachers union in the country. It was their members who went door-to-door for Johnson’s election. It was their members who tacked up Johnson’s campaign posters and donated the dollars for his TV ads. Now, it is their members who comprise Johnson’s dwindling band of supporters. If it weren’t for them, the mayor could hold a “Reelect Brandon Johnson” rally on a unicycle. Most of Johnson’s policies are standard-issue leftist remedies for big cities. To paraphrase Gilbert and Sullivan, “He is the very model of a modern progressive mayor.” That model is not working. Not in Chicago and not elsewhere. Progressive mayors and prosecutors across the country have made their cities dangerous and ungovernable. Unfortunately, failure has not changed their minds or their policies. Brandon Johnson is no exception. Consider the mayor’s proposal for the city to own and operate grocery stores in impoverished areas. Let’s call them “CastroMarts.” Johnson is right to say some neighborhoods have become “food deserts.” He should ask himself why that is so. Part of the answer is poverty, but those areas were poor before the grocery stores abandoned them. What changed is that those areas are now plagued with organized retail theft, which is almost never prosecuted. Without delving into the root causes of rampant crime (Kamala Harris is searching for them in Central America), it’s up to local police to stop the predation, and it’s up to local prosecutors to go after the robbers and looters. That’s not happening in Chicago – or in San Francisco, Washington, Seattle, Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis, Baltimore, Cleveland, or Portland. Those city governments have abandoned their fundamental responsibilities to “serve and protect.” Is the theory here that somehow thieves wouldn’t steal from city-owned grocery stores? What’s the evidence for that – or that city workers could do a better job than trained professionals? Those businesses operate on very thin margins and require efficient, experienced management. If you don’t sell meat and produce quickly, they rot. The words “quick” and “efficient” have never been used in the same sentence as “Chicago city worker.” Better adjectives would be “slow,” “unionized,” and “well-paid.” When you apply the correct adjectives to grocery store ownership, you get sclerotic management, high prices, and an endless string of taxpayer subsidies. You will get CastroMart, not Walmart. Brandon Johnson’s notions about education are just as compelling. His latest brainstorm is to close the best schools in the city. His stated reason is “equity,” which apparently means “leveling down.” There is no allegation that admission to these selective schools is biased. It is purely merit-based. Yet Chicago’s school board, working closely with the CTU and the mayor, recently approved a plan to “transition away” from these schools. That’s a polite way of saying, “We are going to kill them if we can.” The teachers union defends this euthanasia because of what they call the schools’ “deep inequity.” The facts belie the catchphrase. [Over half the students in the 11 selective high schools come from low-income families. Around 70% are black or Hispanic.](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/chicago-teachers-union-kills-excelling-schools-to-force-students-into-dysfunction/) Where’s the “deep inequity”? Parents are up in arms. They see powerful, entrenched interests trying to deny their children a good education and cynically justifying it in the name of progressive ideals. They’re right. Johnson’s proposals for migrants are just as popular. Chicago has long proclaimed itself a “sanctuary city,” a label it adopted when sending that virtue signal was costless. It’s not costless anymore. Chicago leaders’ response is to offload all that expensive virtue onto other cities. They are retaining the “sanctuary” slogan, oblivious to the irony. The number of migrants coming to Chicago is still a trickle compared to those surging into Texas and Arizona across an open border. Even so, Chicago can’t handle the modest numbers. It doesn’t have any place to put them or any money to pay for the vital services they require. You see them now camped out on cold city streets and begging for spare change. It’s heartbreaking. Chicago’s real answer to reducing their number is “winter.” Johnson’s original plan was to set up migrant camps across the city. Voters went berserk. Johnson got the message and backed down. His latest plan is to put the migrants in hotels and at O’Hare Airport, issue tickets to the buses that bring them, and blame it all on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. While Johnson has no answers for this deepening mess, he didn’t create it. President Biden did that. Biden is the Einstein who decided to dismantle all of Trump’s programs, such as “Remain in Mexico,” that helped stem the flow of illegals. What was Biden’s rationale? Because the programs were Trump’s. That’s it. To replace them, Biden put in … well, nothing. Surprisingly, that has not worked well. Even the staunchest Democrats recognize the political problems that unchecked immigration is creating. Some are from pushback in the general population, which can see the failure. Some come specifically from the black community, which is furious about this wave of migrants who compete with Americans for jobs, housing, and social services. Hispanics living here legally are none too happy either. Since Democrats depend on both minorities, especially African Americans, to win elections, the internal fissures over immigration pose real problems. They divide ideological progressives from fellow leftists who are more attentive to their minority constituents. The difficulties will only get worse as the numbers keep rising and the Biden administration keeps resisting efforts to close the border. Those tensions are already visible in Chicago’s minority neighborhoods. But immigration is only one of Brandon Johnson’s headaches. On issue after issue, he has no sensible plans to move forward and few ideas about how to cope with the city’s spiraling problems. His administration is a shambles, and voters know it. They need help. In fact, they are demanding it. They want safety, education, and other basic services. They have learned to their regret that they won’t get any of them from the incompetent, unpopular ideologue in City Hall. Charles Lipson is the Peter B.

    "text": "Swedish startup Modvion has built the world’s tallest wooden wind turbine tower, and it’s now sending power to 400 homes in Sweden.\nThe 2-megawatt (MW) wooden wind turbine, sited outside Skara, northeast of Gothenburg, was built for the electric utility Varberg Energi, and it’s just started providing power to Sweden’s grid.\nThe world’s tallest wooden wind turbine has a tower that’s 344 feet (105 meters) tall. And if you include the tip of the highest blade, it’s 492 feet (150 meters) tall.\nThe tower’s thick walls have 144 layers of laminated veneer lumber. Each layer consists of 3 millimeters of sustainable spruce. The tower was built in seven sections with 28 stacked modules held together by steel fittings glued into place.\nThe wood is strong but lighter than steel, and Modvion says one of its main selling points is that the modular tower is easier to transport on standard roads.\nFurther, the wooden towers are carbon negative – they not only store carbon but continue to absorb it during their lifetime. At the end of life, the tower walls can be reused as high-strength beams for the building industry.\nDanish wind giant Vestas made the 2 MW turbine mounted on the wooden tower. Vestas has been a shareholder in Modvion since 2021, and this is the first project in which Modvion’s tower technology and a Vestas turbine have been paired.\nModvion told the BBC that it aims to open a factory in 2027 that will manufacture 100 wooden wind turbines annually.\nTop comment by Marcus R\nLiked by 5 people Good to see this getting the attention it deserves Michelle. Once they have their larger towers this will be really interesting.\nJust a quick input, Chalmers signed an agreement with Varberg Energi regarding the produced energy, so the electricity will \"power\" parts of a university and not homes - not that it physically matters in a grid though 🙂\nView all comments Read more: This new ‘world’s largest’ wind turbine makes power in severe typhoons\nMain photo: Modvion; Module: Paul Wennerholm",

    "text": "Este sábado 17 de agosto la militancia revolucionaria se movilizará en rechazo a los intentos de la ultraderecha por sembrar la violencia en el país y en respaldo a la victoria electoral obtenida por el presidente de la República, Nicolás Maduro, del pasado 28 de julio.\nLa convocatoria fue realizada por el primer vicepresidente del Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), Diosdado Cabello, en su programa Con el Mazo Dando, en el que señaló que el pueblo se mantendrá en la calle celebrando la victoria.\n“Invito al chavismo a una marcha en toda Venezuela el día 17 de agosto para celebrar el triunfo electoral de la Revolución Bolivariana. El sábado nosotros vamos para la calle a marchar a seguir celebrando la victoria de la Revolución Bolivariana, además tenemos dos días que no marchamos y estoy perdiendo la costumbre y forma”, afirmó Cabello.\nEs importante resaltar que esta movilización popular ha sido convocada ante las pretensiones de la extremaderecha de volver a ejecutar acciones terroristas ese mismo día, cuando la jefa de estos grupos violentos, María Corina Machado, a estado convocando a “movilizaciones de calle”.",

    "title": "DC just voted in a new bill that would add several thousand new EV chargers over the next few years",
    "text": "The automotive industry has reached a point where many of the best new cars are all-electric. However, drivers still have significant reasons not to buy one. Specifically, there remains an electric charger problem for those who don’t have one at home. Now, DC has voted in a new law that would add several thousand EV chargers over the next few years.\nDC has a solution for one of the most significant barriers between all-electric cars and buyers The amount of all-electric chargers has dramatically increased in recent years. However, these changes may not be enough to support as many EVs as various entities hope. Now, according to WUSA 9 , the District of Columbia has just approved a bill called “Right to Charge.” Essentially, it seeks to make public EV chargers much more accessible for residents.\nSo, how does this new bill work, and will it persuade people to buy all-electric cars? Basically, it makes it so that the city adds more public electric chargers as the amount of registered EVs grows. It also seeks to make chargers a right for renters. Councilman Charles Allen says this bill will add thousands of new charges in just a few years. However, it should be noted that the current number of chargers around D.C. is proportional to the number of registered EVs.\nThe Councilman had this to say, “We need people to go electric — and fast. his bill sends a clear signal that coming soon, there are going to be a lot of chargers available in places where people live, work and shop.”\nOf course, for this bill to work, officials have to tally the number of all-electric cars and provide the proper funding for chargers that represent five percent of the vehicles. This bill also includes the Electric Vehicle Charging Incentive Program, which would create vouchers for landlords to build chargers. The Department of Energy and Environment will administer this part of the bill.\nBased on numbers from 2023, D.C. has about 8,100 all-electric cars and 1,057 charging stations for drivers. As mentioned, this number of chargers meets the new bill’s requirements. However, it’s important to note that the number of EVs was up by 37 percent compared to 2022, which shows the need for continued growth.",

    "title": "Pope Francis' Unholy Alliances",
    "text": "By Eric Rozenman\nOne can pray for the speedy recovery of Pope Francis , 88 and hospitalized with pneumonia, while wishing that when called in 2013, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio stayed in Argentina.\nAs pope, Francis has been wrong consistently. He seems unable to render “unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.”\nFor example, five days before leaving office, the Biden administration announced removal of Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Both sides said the Catholic Church helped arrange the deal, which involved release of Cuban political prisoners, and that President Biden had spoken with Pope Francis beforehand. (Back in the Oval Office, President Trump restored Cuba to the terrorism list.)\nAlso in January, Biden awarded Pope Francis the Medal of Freedom “with distinction.” Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn dissented: “Biden will leave behind a weakened American presence on the world stage at a time of heightened global conflict. In\nRome, meanwhile, Pope Francis has diminished the papacy’s moral witness in similar ways and for similar reasons.”\nMcGurn noted that “a new book by the pope calls for an international investigation into whether Israeli actions in Gaza meet the definition of genocide. … The Vatican’s job isn’t to bless wars. But under Pope Francis it appears to have abandoned just-war principles” long taught by the church and by which free Western societies defend themselves.\nAlan Dershowitz, Harvard University Law School professor emeritus, called Francis’ Israeli genocide innuendo a renewed antisemitic blood libel . Author Melanie Phillips said the pope’s attack on an Israel fighting for its life was influenced by “ Palestinian Christian liberation theology ” designating Palestinian Arabs as Jesus oppressed by the Jews.\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot the pope appeared to mix politics with pastoral appointments in naming San Diego’s Cardinal Robert McElroy as new archbishop of Washington, D.C. During Trump’s first term as president, McElroy criticized administration policy of separating children from illegal immigrant parents. At the news conference announcing his selection as archbishop, McElroy said Trump’s “wider, indiscriminate massive deportation” of illegals would contradict Catholic teachings .\nPope Francis hopes to unite China’s “underground” Catholic house churches, which are loyal to Rome, with the Beijing-dominated official branch. He wants to win full diplomatic recognition for the Vatican from Communist China, which is busy and at times brutally “Sinicizing” all religion.\nIn 2023 the pontiff acquiesced to China’s appointment of a new bishop in Shanghai . The move ignored church prerogatives and seemingly violated a 2018 Vatican-China agreement. Washington Times columnist R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. castigated Francis for speaking “gibberish” about “respectful” relations with China.\nSimilarly, the pope has had little or nothing to say about China’s best-known dissident, the imprisoned Catholic Jimmy Lai, and delayed for years acknowledging President Xi Jinping’s slow genocide of the Uyghurs .\nThree months after Russia invaded Ukraine the pope said the “ barking of NATO at the door of Russia” may have led to the invasion. He deplored the war’s brutality but said he did not know if other countries should supply more weapons to Kiev. Meanwhile, the head of the embattled country’s Greek Catholic Church accused Russia of killing scores of Ukrainian religious leaders and damaging or destroying hundreds of churches.\nWhen Peruvian Rev. Gustavo Gutierrez, known as the father of “liberation theology,” died last year, obituary writers noted that Pope Benedict XVI termed liberation theology a “fundamental threat to the faith of the church.” Romanian communist defector Ion Mihai Pacepa called it “ Christianized Marxism .”\nBut Pope Francis, under whose tenure Gutierrez’s reputation improved, once described liberation theology with its “preferential option for the poor” as “ a positive thing ” in Latin America. Complaining of a “ very strong reactionary attitude ” among some U.S. Catholics, the pope in 2023 removed Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas. Strickland had warned that a pending Vatican synod could cast doubt on “basic truths,” including sinfulness of sex outside of marriage and “undeniable biological and God-given” gender identity.\nIn 2018 U.S. bishops considered calling for a Vatican investigation into how Washington, D.C.’s Theodore McCarrick, who resigned as cardinal, climbed the church hierarchy despite years of rumors about his alleged sexual predation among seminarians. Francis reportedly was warned about McCarrick soon after becoming pope, but came to rely upon him nevertheless. Last year, Catholic World Report castigated the pope for talking a good game about abusive homosexual priests but failing to achieve real reform.\nThe Catholic Church is one of the world’s largest institutions. The beliefs and actions of its leader matter to non-Catholics as well. In that context, Francis has failed us.\nEric Rozenman is author, most recently, of From Elvis to Trump, Eyewitness to the Unraveling: Co-Starring Richard Nixon, Andy Warhol, Bill Clinton, The Supremes and Barack Obama!",
