    "title": "Tony Pollard grew up watching the Titans. Now the Memphis kid is home",
    "text": "Tony Pollard grew up loving Eddie George, Chris Johnson. 'Perfect timing' brings him home to Titans Nick Suss Nashville Tennessean Anyone who's made the three-hour drive from Nashville to Memphis knows just how mind-numbing it can be. But hey, it's just three hours. And for new Tennessee Titans running back Tony Pollard , that puts him three hours from home.\nPollard officially signed with the Titans on Thursday morning, coming to Nashville as superstar back Derrick Henry's replacement after five years with the Dallas Cowboys. Pollard grew up in Memphis, playing his high school ball at Melrose and his college ball at the University of Memphis. Coming to Nashville means being close to those connections, close enough that his mom was able to stop in for his introductory press conference Thursday.\nIt's all part of the appeal.\n\"There was other interest but it just felt like this was the place for me to be,\" Pollard said. \"Especially coming back home with family so close. Just talking to the coaches, being here, being around, feeling the energy of the new staff and the new guys in the building.\"\nBETTER WITHOUT THE KING? Here's case Tennessee Titans can be better with Tony Pollard, Tyjae Spears than Derrick Henry\nPollard says he grew up watching the Titans and admiring running backs like Eddie George and Chris Johnson. Now he joins the lineage that connected George, Johnson and Henry, collaborating with second-year back Tyjae Spears to try to make the transition out of the Henry era as seamless as possible.\nHe says he's not focused on filling Henry's role. He can only focus on himself, what he can do to get better and what he can do to help the team. For Pollard, who broke 1,000 rushing yards each of the past two seasons, that likely means splitting time with Spears like he did with Ezekiel Elliott in Dallas to maximize his strengths. In 2021-22, when Pollard came into his own as co-chair of the Cowboys backfield with Elliott, he averaged 6.1 yards any time he touched the ball.\nNow he'll get the chance to do that in front of his home-state crowd.\n\"It was just perfect timing,\" Pollard said. \"Everything just worked out the way it should. Me being from Memphis, born and raised in Memphis, went to the University of Memphis, I’m very familiar with the area. I’ve got a lot of family out here. So it made sense for me to be here, come home.\"\nTHE GRADE: How we graded Tennessee Titans signing RB Tony Pollard in NFL free agency\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

Aunque no se dedica a la gastronomía se metió a concursar en el programa y al cocinar una delicia argentina recibió todo tipo de halagos de parte del jurado.\nLeé también: Llega el primer Festival del asado y la empanada con platos desde $1500: dónde es y qué se puede comer\nTorales en realidad se dedica a crear juegos de mesa, pero aclara que la gastronomía es una de sus grandes pasiones. Fue a probar suerte en el famoso ciclo de cocina en su versión australiana y no le fue nada mal cuando preparó un plato y acompañamiento bien argentino y de otras regiones de Sudamérica.\nLa humitá con chipá, el plato ganador de MasterChef Australia. (Foto: Instagram/@delacruzcooks) Es la receta que eligió para debutar en el programa y estaba lleno de nervios por saber si lograrían interpretar bien la mezcla de sabores. El mendocino se mandó con una humita con chipa. El resultado dejó embelezados a los jurados australianos, quienes aplaudieron su plato. Pero antes de la degustación, el participante afirmó: “Mi sueño fue armar un plato que pudiese mostrar estas bellas comidas, no solo de Argentina, sino de toda América del Sur” .\n“Esa es la comida por la que viajaría a tu país . La dulzura de ese maíz de las humitas es simplemente preciosa. Allí también está lo ahumado . Increíble. Quiero volver a entrar con una cuchara en este plato, una y otra vez. Absolutamente me encanta, bien hecho”, comentó la periodista y crítica gastronómica Sofía Levin .\nLas empanadas de Juan De La Cruz. (Foto: Instagram/@delacruzcooks) Los elogios no terminaron ahí: “Juan, sos el participante a vencer”, le dijeron luego de probar unas empanadas fritascon chimichurri, el plato más argentino de todos. El mendocino además es músico y suele conducir segmentos de tv. En un perfecto inglés, explicó para el c uenta en Instagram del programa Masterchef Australia como hace su chimichurri:\nJuan Cruz de la Torre, Masterchef Australia En su cuenta de Instagram , el cocinero amateur publicó una imagen de las empanadas y apuntó sobre las empanadas:. “ Se trata de empanadas, pero también de cultura, representación y orgullo. ¡Me encanta ser australiano y también me encanta ser latinoamericano! Mi sueño es dar a conocer esta comida y ellos lo consiguen!Para Argentina y América Latina. Con recetas adaptadas a los requisitos dietéticos para que todos puedan probarla. Hoy sirvo media docena para 5 jueces, así que puedo comerme uno con mi chimichurri vertido por el gran Jamie.”, comenzó diciendo.",

    "text": "USC Football News: Caleb Williams Ready for NFL Debut with Bears: 'It's All About the Win'\nCaleb Williams is set to make his highly anticipated NFL debut as the Chicago Bears face off against the Tennessee Titans on September 8.\nThe former USC quarterback enters the 2024 season with significant expectations after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's\nNFL Draft.\nWilliams is focused on team success rather than individual statistics. He understands that winning is the priority, regardless of personal performance metrics.\n“As long as we get a win,” Williams said. “Because last time I remembered, the wins are the most important thing. And so as long as we get that win, at the end of the day, 100 yards, 400, it all becomes the same.\"\nAs the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, Williams has the chance to become the first No. 1 overall pick to win a Week 1 start since David Carr did so with the\nHouston Texans in 2002.\nHistorically, rookie quarterbacks have struggled in their first games, with no wins in the last five seasons. The last rookie to secure a victory in a Week 1 start was Sam Darnold, another USC product, in 2018.\nThe Bears have named Williams a team captain, a role he takes seriously. \"I'm extremely grateful,” Williams said. “I can't really think of how many rookies are captains, especially with a team so talented like this.\n\"We're a pretty young team but we obviously have a good amount of vets on this team, so to be named a captain by my peers and colleagues, my teammates and my friends and brothers I'm extremely grateful, extremely happy and something I told them as soon as I got to be able to break it down or talk to them and things like that, so. You know, ready to go. Fired up. Extremely grateful and we're excited.\"\nHis teammates have expressed strong confidence in his abilities as they prepare for the season opener.\n\"The expectation is what it always is: winning,\" said receiver\nKeenan Allen. \"No matter who the quarterback is, you want to win. I wouldn’t rather be with another guy right now than Caleb. He’s gotten better ever since we started. The confidence is through the roof.\"\n“He went out there and proved himself, took command of the offense,” said Bears receiver DJ Moore. “He started opening up. People saw that and we’re rocking with him.”\nWilliams showcased his talent during the preseason, drawing attention through his performances, which were featured in the HBO series “Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Chicago Bears.”\nHe is currently favored to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, a title last claimed by a USC player in 1982.\nThe Bears have long sought a standout quarterback, and Williams has the potential to break franchise records, including the elusive 4,000-yard passing season. With a talented offensive roster around him, expectations are high as he steps into this pivotal role.\nAs the season kicks off, Williams' teammates are eager to see him lead the team to victory.\n“I just want him to go out there and play football for real,” Moore said. “Do what he’s been doing. He’s a winner, so lead us to a win.\"",

    "title": "Navy Performed A \"Miracle\": Rajnath Singh On Operations In Foreign Waters",
    "text": "The Navy has foiled attacks by pirates on several ships in the region since January. (File) The Indian Navy has performed a \"miracle\" (karishma), Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said, heaping wholehearted praise for the force's numerous operations in foreign waters where it assisted several merchant ships commandeered or threatened by pirates. In an exclusive interview to PTI, Rajnath Singh also dropped hints of the government's readiness to positively consider the Navy's proposal for construction of a second aircraft carrier. The Navy has been making a strong pitch for having the second indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-II) with a displacement of 45,000 tonnes which is estimated to cost close to Rs 40,000 crore with the envisaged specifications. Exuding confidence of the National Democratic Alliance retaining power for a third straight term, he said the new government's focus would be to make India totally self-reliant in the defence sector. Rajnath Singh said India's annual defence exports crossed Rs 21,000 crore mark for the first time in 2023-24 and that his ministry has set a target of increasing it to Rs 50,000 crore in the next five-six years. \"We will take it to more than Rs 50,000 crore by 2029-30,\" he said. On the Navy's operations in the strategic waterways, Rajnath Singh said the force deserves praise. \"The India Navy has done miracle. Congratulations to the Navy. (Indian Navy ne Karishma kiya. Navy ko Badhai),\" he said. In the last few months, the Indian Navy extended assistance to a number of merchant vessels in the Western Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and strategic waterways around the Red Sea following attacks on them. Late last month, the Indian Navy swiftly assisted a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker with 30 crew members, including 22 Indians, after the vessel came under missile attack from Houthi militants. There have been growing global concerns over attacks on various commercial vessels in the Red Sea by the Houthi militants. The Navy has foiled attacks by pirates on several ships in the region since January. Asked about the Navy's push for a second indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC), Singh indicated that it is being favourably considered. India's first indigenously-built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant (IAC I) was commissioned in September last year. Built at a cost of around Rs 23,000 crore, INS Vikrant has a sophisticated air defence network and anti-ship missile systems. It has the capacity to hold 30 fighter jets and helicopters. The Navy has been pitching for three aircraft carriers to deal with China's growing naval prowess and influence over the Indian Ocean region. At present, India has two aircraft carriers - INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant. INS Vikramaditya is a Russian origin platform. To a question on the Agnipath scheme, Rajnath Singh said its implementation has been satisfactory and that the government is taking measures to help the youths who will not be retained by the armed forces after their initial stint. In June 2022, the government rolled out the Agnipath recruitment scheme for short-term induction of personnel with an aim to bring down the age profile of the three services. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com It provides for recruiting youths between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years with a provision to retain 25 percent of them for 15 more years.

    "text": "Esta intervención subraya cómo, en ocasiones, una simple parada de tráfico puede convertirse en un acto heroico, recordándonos el valor de la empatía y el juicio crítico en la labor policial diaria. MÉXICO.- El 2 de diciembre de 2022, una situación de rutina se convirtió en una historia de salvación gracias a la intervención oportuna de los oficiales del Departamento de Policía de South Carolina. Ese día, los agentes recibieron una llamada reportando un vehículo que se desplazaba de manera errática, lo que sugería que el conductor podría estar intoxicado. Al recibir la alerta, los oficiales comenzaron a seguir al vehículo, un Ford Escape rojo, que zigzagueaba de un carril a otro. En las imágenes captadas por las cámaras de los patrulleros, se observó cómo el coche se desplazaba peligrosamente, impactando incluso contra una barda. Los policías encendieron sus luces de emergencia y se acercaron al vehículo. Cuando la conductora finalmente se detuvo, los oficiales notaron signos visibles de que algo no estaba bien. Aunque inicialmente sospecharon de intoxicación por alcohol, una conversación con la mujer reveló una realidad diferente. La conductora, cuyo comportamiento lento y apariencia inusual llamaron la atención de los agentes, admitió haber tomado solo dos tazas de té y dos pastillas para el dolor de cabeza. A pesar de no encontrar indicios de consumo de alcohol o drogas en el vehículo, los oficiales decidieron que la situación ameritaba una evaluación médica. “No te voy a dejar seguir manejando”, le dijo uno de los policías, subrayando la preocupación por su estado de salud. Los agentes llamaron a una ambulancia, asegurándose de que la mujer recibiera atención médica inmediata. En el hospital, se descubrió que la conductora tenía un tumor cerebral. La intervención rápida de los oficiales permitió que la mujer fuese sometida a una cirugía de ocho horas para remover el tumor, salvándole así la vida. “Los oficiales hicieron un excelente trabajo”, comentó posteriormente la mujer, quien agradeció a los agentes por su decisión que resultó crucial para su supervivencia. Esta historia destaca la importancia de la diligencia y el compromiso de los agentes de policía para velar no solo por el cumplimiento de la ley, sino también por la seguridad y bienestar de la ciudadanía. En este caso, la prioridad de los oficiales fue clara: proteger la vida humana por encima de cualquier otra consideración. La acción de los oficiales no solo evitó un potencial accidente de tráfico, sino que también permitió una intervención médica a tiempo que salvó una vida. Esta intervención subraya cómo, en ocasiones, una simple parada de tráfico puede convertirse en un acto heroico, recordándonos el valor de la empatía y el juicio crítico en la labor policial diaria.",

His call comes in response to a fatwa issued by Darul Uloom Deoband concerning the concept of \"Ghazwa-e-Hind,\" which is perceived to glorify martyrdom in the context of India's potential invasion.\nNarsinghanand has labeled the fatwa as an incitement to violence against Hindus and has requested CM Yogi Adityanath to take decisive action against Darul Uloom Deoband.\nAlso read: Darul Uloom Deoband issues fatwa endorsing 'Ghazwa-e-Hind', NCPCR takes action\n\"Through its fatwa, Darool Uloom has official announced Ghazwa-e-Hind. Mahant Digvijay Nath's grandson must understand the meaning of this fatwa. You are the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. We want you to become Prime Minister one day. They have called for killing of 100 crore Hindus,\" he said in a video message.\nDescribing Darul Uloom Deoband as an ideological center of terrorism, Yati Narsinghanand urged Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to deploy bulldozers to demolish the Islamic seminary.\n\"Send your bulldozers and raze Darul Uloom Deoband. Nothing would happen by demolishing properties of petty people,\" he added.\nHe additionally urged Hindus to demolish Darul Uloom Deoband themselves if Hindu leaders fail to fulfill their responsibilities.\nGhazwa-e-Hind is an Islamic eschatological concept that envisions a future military expedition led by the Muslim Messiah against non-Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. The term originates from the Arabic words \"ghazwa,\" signifying a military campaign or raid, and \"Hind,\" referring to India.\nIt's crucial to acknowledge that not all Muslims subscribe to the belief in Ghazwa-e-Hind. Some Islamic scholars contend that the hadiths referencing Ghazwa-e-Hind lack authenticity, or they should be understood metaphorically. Others argue that even if the hadiths are authentic, they do not justify violence against non-Muslims.",
