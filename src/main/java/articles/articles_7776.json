    "title": "2023 Was Earth's Hottest Year Ever, AND The Climate Outlook Is Finally Improving",
    "text": "2023 Was Earth's Hottest Year Ever, AND The Climate Outlook Is Finally Improving\nOur money is very much on Hope.\nNo two ways about it:\n 2023 was the hottest year on record, even before the temperature data for all of December is tabulated, beating out the previous hottest year, 2016. The heat from global warming led to extreme weather around the world, causing devastating flooding in Pakistan and deadly heat waves in India and the USA, as well as contributing to vast wildfires in Canada that turned skylines across the US bloody red. The city of Lahaina on Maui disappeared overnight due to wildfires made worse by drought and by years of invasive grasses spreading unchecked.\nIf we get to our goal of 5,000 subscribers by year’s end, YOU get a week where all pictures of terrible people are replaced by cats. Just 44 to go!\nThis is the year a lot of humans realized, yes, this is how things are going to be: Some years may be better, many years likely to be worse, and the only way to keep things from getting much much worse is to stop burning fossil fuels. Period.\nNow the good news: Despite the endless foot dragging since most scientists started yelling about the threat in the 1980s and 1990s, Our Stupid Species is finally taking the crisis seriously and taking real actions to transition away from fossil fuels. There’s really no doubt anymore that the energy transition is underway; the question now is how rapidly we can manage to do it, and how much climate damage we can prevent by acting right now. Despair is a waste of time, and at this point probably worse than denial. Both are excuses to do nothing, which would be a damn shame at a time when the technology and money are finally rolling out solutions.\nLet’s look at some highlights for 2023, and keep in mind that the elections of 2024 really will decide whether we build on that progress toward a clean energy future.\nEnhanced Geothermal Energy Works!\nIn November, a modest little pilot plant in Nevada set the stage for a huge change in how we generate electricity: An\nenhanced geothermal plant built by Fervo Energy began delivery of power to the grid. It’s not a lot of power, but it’s remarkable because of how it works: Instead of having to find spots like Iceland where volcanic activity heats up groundwater, enhanced geothermal drills into the earth to find heat, then adds water to get the steam that drives turbines.\nThis is game-changing stuff, with the potential to cover the gap in the maximum amount of energy that can come from wind, solar, and storage. There’s every reason to think that the US can reach its goal of\nphasing out fossil fuel for power generation by 2035.\nEVs Are Really Here, Not Just Toys\nOK, they’ve been well past the “toy” phase for quite a while now, and yes, the transition won’t happen overnight, which is good news because it will take time to get the charging infrastructure built. But the first public charging stations funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are being built now (even if Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine\n forgot to credit Joe Biden), and will be coming online in 2024. EV sales topped 1 million nationwide, the nation set new fuel efficiency records, and the EPA announced emissions standards that will force automakers to go zero emissions or go home. Oh yeah, and the economic benefits of Biden’s climate policy, including the surge in constructing battery factories, are projected to provide a boost to working class Americans and communities hit hardest by pollution.\nAnd don’t believe the lies about EVs being “worse” for the environment than internal combustion vehicles. There’s a climate cost for everything, yes, but the amount of stuff dug out of the ground for renewable energy and EVs is, and will remain,\n a tiny fraction of the filth necessary for gas-burning vehicles. That carbon cost will only decrease as the grid relies more on renewable energy, too. We even have electric mining equipment now. Yes, we absolutely need to address the human rights abuses against miners in the developing world, but A) fossil fuel production is terrible for worker rights around the world, and 2) there’s nothing about minerals needed for EV batteries that inherently abuses workers; that’s a capitalism problem. Let’s fix that, absolutely.\nMost People Know It’s Time To Act\nThis year’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai was in many ways nothing to cheer about. The president of the conference, the UAE’s freaking national oil company CEO, brazenly claimed it was\nimpossible to ever phase out fossil fuels, which simply isn’t true according to energy experts and climate scientists who aren’t employed by Big Oil. On the upside, he looked like a goddamned idiot with the entire world paying attention to him.\nAnd instead of a strong commitment to actually phase out fossil fuels — an absolute necessity to slow and halt global warming — COP28\nadopted a resolution to “transition away” from fossil fuels, without any timeline or firm commitment to get rid of them altogether.\nThat was very much a mixed bag: far short of the commitment needed, but also historic in that it was the first time a UN climate summit had actually named what needs to be done, however vaguely.\nIn a sense, it’s a good summation of where we are on climate: We all\nknow what needs to be done, and we want our governments to do it. We’re even starting, after wasting decades, to do it, and we still have time to prevent the absolute worst effects — the ones that are baked in by previous inaction will be plenty bad enough. As the Fifth National Climate Assessment found, America is making progress on curbing its carbon emissions, but “without deeper cuts in global net greenhouse gas emissions and accelerated adaptation efforts,” climate disasters will only get worse.\nSo here’s the hope part: Every incremental amount of carbon reduction humanity manages is a step toward a livable future. It’s on us, right now, to determine the future of the planet’s climate, as the Climate Assessment reminded us; I’ve added the boldface:\nWhile there are still uncertainties about how the planet will react to rapid warming and catastrophic future scenarios that cannot be ruled out, the future is largely in human hands.\nThere are\nso many smart people busting their asses to get us there. I’m on their side. ·\nNothing To See Here (Literally), Just Climate Change-Fueled Wildfires Draping Nation In Cloud Of Death\nhttps://www.wonkette.com/p/poll-huge-majority-of-americans-want\nPoll: Huge Majority Of Americans Want Climate Change Taught In School.

    "text": "Igreja no Burkina Faso perde dois catequistas\nVatican News (com Fides)\nDor, lágrimas e orações. A Diocese de Dédougou, no Burkina Faso, lamenta o assassinato de dois catequistas, mortos quando regressavam de um curso de formação. Os fatos remontam a sábado, 25 de janeiro.\nSegundo fontes da Diocese de Dédougou, citadas pela Agência Fides, os dois catequistas, Mathias Zongo e Christian Tientga, viajavam de motocicleta. Com eles, a bordo de outra moto, estavam outros dois catequistas. Todos pertencentes à Paróquia de Ouakara, os quatro agentes pastorais terão sido atacados por um grupo de homens armados quando se encontravam perto da cidade de Bondokuy. Os dois catequistas sobreviventes conseguiram escapar, refugiando-se na floresta. Depois de alertado, o pároco, encontrou os corpos sem vida das duas vítimas. Quando o padre chegou, os policiais já estavam no local do crime e abriram investigação.\nNos últimos dias, os corpos dos dois catequistas foram devolvidos às suas famílias (um era pai de três filhos, o outro de sete) e as exéquias tiveram lugar no último fim de semana.\nA polícia, que continua a investigar os factos, anunciou que o que aconteceu no final de janeiro é a quarta emboscada mortal ocorrida em pouco tempo no mesmo local. Em todo Burkina Faso há desde há algum tempo para cá uma escalada de violência, alimentada também pela presença de grupos jihadistas, o que já levou a cerca de dois milhões de deslocados internos.\nObrigado por ter lido este artigo.

They said she completed a confidential competency evaluation in November.\nHer attorney also said Glover was unable to appreciate the charges against her, the potential penalties, the adversarial nature of the legal process, nor provide facts regarding the case, among other things.\nA grand jury indicted Glover on charges of first-degree premeditated murder in the death of her daughter, Giselle, as well as aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in the alleged attack on her roommate.\nThe judge asked for Glover to be back in court on Nov. 5 to review her treatment and competency status.\nAbout the victim\nCourt documents say the 14-year-old was sick, and Glover was to blame.\nAn arrest affidavit says the \"victim was type 1 diabetic and had an electric pump that administers insulin attached to her body.\"\nThe woman who called 911 said Glover stopped giving the teen her insulin on a Monday, and by that Wednesday, \"the (victim) became sick, vomiting, and eventually bedridden.\"\nThe woman told investigators, \"Kelsey Glover would keep the victim in the master bedroom with music playing to drown out her screams for help.\"\nThe woman also said Glover asked for help getting the child to the bathtub to bathe her.\n\"Witnesses also told deputies they saw Ms. Glover holding her 14-year-old daughter's head underwater in the bathtub, and they tried to stop her but were not successful,\" Osceola County Sheriff Marco Lopez said during a news conference shortly after Glover's arrest.",

    "text": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Thursday that he plans to lay off 10,000 employees, bringing staffing levels at his department down to 62,000 — roughly 20,000 fewer than when President Donald Trump took office.\nIn a press release, the department charged with enhancing the health and well-being of the nation — which currently accounts for about 25% of the federal budget — said the staff reduction is in accordance with a Trump executive order issued in February. The moves will save an estimated $1.8 billion in costs in a departmental budget that came to roughly $1.7 trillion last year.\nThe newly announced staffing cuts come on top of roughly 10,000 job reductions that resulted from the Trump administration’s government-wide offers of early retirement and voluntary separation.\nBig changes ahead: HHS will also see significant reorganization, focused on Kennedy’s vow to “make America healthy again.”\n“We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\nThe organizational restructuring will include reducing 28 divisions at HHS to 15, closing half of the department’s 10 regional offices, and centralizing key functions, such as human resources, information technology, procurement and policy. A new Administration for a Healthy America will consolidate multiple existing offices, with a focus on chronic care, disease prevention programs and health resources for low-income Americans.\nJob losses will hit multiple agencies within HHS. The Food and Drug Administration will lose 3,500 full-time employees, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lose 2,400, although the CDC will pick up 1,000 employees currently with the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. The National Institutes of Health will eliminate 1,200 workers through centralization of office functions across its 27 institutes and centers. And the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will lose 300 jobs, which HHS said “will not impact Medicare and Medicaid services.”\nAdvocates sound the alarm: Public health advocates expressed doubts about the likely effectiveness of the cuts and reorganization. “Losing people, losing money, making relationships dysfunctional is not going to improve the health of the American people,” said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, head of the American Public Health Association, per The Washington Post. “Wrong diagnosis, wrong therapy.”\nDemocratic lawmakers said the layoffs and closures would hurt Americans who rely on public health services. “These offices work closely with communities to make sure child care, hospitals, and nursing homes are safe, strengthen rural health care, and much more,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. “The chaos that is coming will guarantee that kids and seniors fall through the cracks with deadly consequences.”\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington said she sees the cuts as largely destructive. “It does not take a genius to understand that pushing out 20,000 workers at our pre-eminent health agencies won’t make Americans healthier—it’ll just mean fewer health services for our communities, more opportunities for disease to spread, and longer waits for lifesaving treatments and cures,” she said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nStill, some lawmakers welcomed the news, saying HHS is unwieldy and in need of a shakeup.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican physician from Louisiana who played a pivotal role in approving Kennedy’s nomination for the top job at HHS, said he hoped the new plan would generate efficiency and improve services. “I am interested in HHS working better, such as lifesaving drug approval more rapidly, and Medicare service improved,” he told the Journal. “I look forward to hearing how this reorganization furthers these goals.”",

    "text": "JOHANNESBURG - The recent national elections in South Africa have left the African National Congress (ANC) in an unfamiliar and precarious position. For the first time since the end of apartheid, the ANC has failed to secure a majority, falling short of the crucial 50 percent threshold required to govern alone. This historic shift has opened the door to a new and uncertain era in South African politics, where coalitions between adversaries may become the norm rather than the exception.\nThe ANC’s decline is not sudden. It’s the culmination of years of dwindling support, driven by corruption scandals, internal factionalism and an inability to address the country’s pressing socio-economic challenges.\nREAD:\n[ANC's fall from grace]\nWhile the party still commands significant loyalty, especially in rural areas such as Limpopo, North West and the Eastern Cape, urban voters and the youth have shown increasing disillusionment with the ruling party. The electorate’s message is clear: the status quo has to undergo a radical shift. The Democratic Alliance (DA), Umkhonto WeSizwe Party (MKP), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and other smaller parties now hold significant bargaining power. The very idea of these parties, particularly the DA, MK Party and EFF, collaborating with the ANC seems improbable given their stark ideological differences and contentious history.\nYet, in politics, necessity often breeds strange bedfellows.\nThe ANC must now navigate a political landscape where compromise and negotiation are essential. The most straightforward path to a coalition would be with the DA, South Africa’s second-largest party, which represents a more liberal, laissez faire approach. However, ideological gaps between the ANC’s leftist policies and the DA’s center-right platform could prove difficult to bridge. The DA has long criticised the ANC’s governance and tolerance of corruption, which may complicate trust-building and policy alignment.\nThe possibility of a coalition between the ANC and former President Jacob Zuma’s MK Party would mark an intriguing yet complex development in South African politics, particularly given that the ANC has an on-going disciplinary process against Zuma based on his formation of the party.\nThe MK Party, steeped in militant rhetoric and radical economic policies, presents a stark contrast to the ANC's more moderate and historically mainstream approach. On the other hand, the EFF, led by Julius Malema, represents a more radical leftist faction, advocating for extensive land reforms and the nationalising of key industries - policies that resonate with a disenfranchised segment of the population but are anathema to both the ANC’s moderate wing and the DA.\nA coalition with the EFF might force the ANC to adopt more radical policies, risking further alienation of moderate and business-friendly supporters. Regardless of which coalition path the ANC pursues, the implications for governance are profound.\nA coalition government, by its very nature, requires consensus-building and a willingness to prioritise national interests over party ideologies. This could foster a more inclusive and accountable governance model, breaking away from the single-party dominance that has characterised South African politics for decades.\nHowever, the potential for instability is high.\nCoalitions are inherently fragile and prone to internal conflicts and power struggles.\nSouth Africa’s coalition experience at the municipal level has shown both the promise and pitfalls of such arrangements, with several local governments experiencing frequent disruptions and policy paralysis. The prospect of a unity government, comprising erstwhile adversaries, might seem a daunting and perhaps even unpalatable solution to many.\nYet, it could also be the crucible for a new political culture in South Africa - one that works for the will of the people, embraces diversity, encourages debate, and necessitates collaboration.\nThis could reinvigorate the country’s democratic institutions and restore public faith in governance. For the ANC, this is a critical juncture.\nThe party must decide whether to cling to its past dominance or adapt to the evolving political landscape by embracing coalition politics. For the opposition, this is an opportunity to shape the country’s future directly, moving from the periphery into a central role in governance.\nDenga Mavhunga and Nkateko Muloiwa\n*This article is the opinion of the authors and does not reflect the views of eNCA.",

    "text": "One of the world’s largest religious gatherings will take place on June 3 at the Namugongo shrines in Wakiso District, Kampala, with believers from all over Africa undertaking a miles-long pilgrimage on foot to arrive for the yearly event. This year’s Uganda Martyrs Day, like past stagings not affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, is expected to attract anywhere between 500,000 and millions of Christians from all over the world. This tenacious propagation of the Word of God is the people’s embodiment of faith in the face of hardship. It is also a reminder of how humans may extend the boundaries of humanity by the sacrifices they are willing to make. On top of this, pilgrims to Namugongo remind us of the life and ministry of Ugandan evangelist Apolo Waswa Kasirye Munubi Kivebulaya (1870-1933). In the book The Mission of Apolo Kivebulaya: Religious Encounter & Social Change In The Great Lakes c. 1865-1935 by Prof Emma Wild-Wood, we see that Kivebulaya was not only an evangelist of the Mbuti pygmies in Congo and an active Christian missionary in the northern Great Lakes Region. He was also a man on the move, much like the pilgrims who are Namugongo-bound. Translocal agent Kivebulaya recognised Christianity as a transregional religion, so he sought to be a missionary for a worldwide community of Christians and potential Christians. The sweep of his vision viewed all nations as one nation in the name of God. “The Lord loves us all…the Messiah died for us all…God gives life to us all…we are brothers and sisters with Jesus,” he said. In the process, he showed very early on that our present-day pilgrims are agentive in their “peregrinations” (travels from one place to another on foot). Accordingly, “placing this relatively humble protagonist [Kivebulaya] at the centre of national enquiry demonstrates the ways in which converts, who became propagators of Christianity, inculcated translocal religious and social change within developing transregional networks,” Prof Wild-Wood writes. Kivebulaya’s ministry straddled two colonial systems, Congo’s and Uganda’s. In doing so, he situated the work of missionaries between the imperial powers and national leaderships. As a result, he historicised inequalities of power and showed how authorities of any kind operating in the absence of Christianity were oppressive. This historicisation was further expressed by the collaboration and communication that existed between different ethno-linguistic groups with the aid of Kivebulaya’s unbending commitment to equality between them. Borderless vision of Christianity As Ugandan elites and Christian Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries hinged their activities on ethno-nationalism and state-nationalism, Kivebulaya’s vision looked towards a borderless world in which Christianity reflected all humanity. By promoting a cosmopolitan view of belonging, which placed Christians in a global movement, he inspired the revivalists. The latter pursued a universal Christian vision within the Anglican Church, initially. Breaking out of the chrysalis of denominational faith, they revitalised (or revived) the universalism of the Christian Gospel in the same way Kivebulaya had always preached. In the 1920s, a movement known as Balokole or East African Revival emerged. “The revival was largely responsible for disseminating admiration for Kivebulaya across the region. Histories of the revival often begin in 1933, after Kivebulaya’s death, with the dramatic scenes of repentance at Gahini Hospital, Rwanda, being identified as a sign of rupture from formulaic Anglicanism. Kivebulaya’s inspiration of early Balokole (‘saved ones’) began whilst he was still alive,” writes Prof Wild-Wood. Indeed, many revivalists link this conversion rupture with the influence and example of Kivebulaya. Their conversation proved the correctness of the Paulo Coelho dictum: “The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.” Proto-revivalist The early revivalists sought to return the Church to the “zeal that created martyrs and propelled missionary activity.” They thus preached repentance, the public confession of sin and the expectation of altered social behaviour. This expectation envisioned the renunciation of clan or ethnic affiliations, too. Furthermore, revivalists were inspired by the ‘Pilkington revival” of 1893. This revival, according to the Dictionary of African Christianity Biography, stated: “George Pilkington was a CMS lay missionary in Uganda. A graduate of the University of Cambridge and strongly influenced by the Keswick movement, he arrived in Buganda (now Uganda) with Bishop Alfred Tucker’s party in 1891. There he found a militarised society, rent by religious factionalism and the conflicts of the colonial scramble. Pilkington’s remarkable linguistic ability enabled him to quickly get alongside the Baganda soldiers and to realise their spiritual hunger and desire for literacy.” Kivebulaya, the revivalists believed, was a living link to this revival. This revival was averse to elevating any single person above others, even though it recognised and celebrated singular personalities such as Kivebulaya. In 1922, Simeoni Nsibambi (1897-1978), a prominent Christian at Namirembe, was struck by the exemplary greatness of Kivebulaya. As he preached passionately in Kampala markets and in Mengo Hospital, Nsibambi decided to broaden his ministry to western Uganda. He also prayed for the whole country. “As a mark of asceticism, he stopped wearing shoes, which had become signs of wealth and eminence, and walked barefoot, as Kivebulaya did. He named one of his sons ‘Apolo’ after Kivebulaya. This son later became Prime Minister of Uganda,” writes Prof Wild-Wood. Ecumene Whole generations of church-persons, thanks to Kivebulaya, were committed to what is known as ecumene (a corruption of the word ‘ecumenical’). This means a cosmopolitan, multilingual world. By locating their revival in the context of global renewal, revivalists such as William Nagenda (1909-1973) and Bishop Festo Kivengere (1919-1988) travelled the Great Lakes Region for fellowship and evangelism. Kivengere is affectionately remembered for openly forgiving Idi Amin despite the unimaginable horrors Uganda’s third president subjected him to. Kivebulaya faced many an uphill journey. Besides Ganda prejudices, he battled the forests and the colonist Belgians as he sought to bring Christianity to the world. It is through his bare-footed, peripatetic ministry, alive to hardships of deprivation of every kind, that Kivebulaya bore proper witness to his Maker. Consequently, the pilgrims travelling to Namugongo can be sure that whatever they are going through in the name of their faith, will renew their faith, as it did for Apolo Kivebulaya",

    "text": "本文来自微信公众号：芯东西 （ID：aichip001），作者：ZeR0，编辑：漠影，题图来自：AI生成\n本文来自微信公众号：芯东西 （ID：aichip001），作者：ZeR0，编辑：漠影，题图来自：AI生成\n芯东西6月19日消息，据海外科技媒体Rest of World报道，三星电子的芯片工程师正在流失，由于长时间工作、低工资和充满敌意的工作文化，许多芯片员工纷纷跳槽，投奔包括美国公司在内的竞争对手。剩下的员工不得不长时间、高强度地轮班工作，以弥补空缺。\n10名现任和前任工程师告诉Rest of World，与竞争对手相比，长时间工作、繁重的工作量、较低的奖金令许多三星工程师感到恐惧，他们正在跳槽到韩国存储芯片制造商SK海力士、美国美光和英特尔以及一些中国存储芯片公司。\n这些知情人士称，在人手不足、本已捉襟见肘的团队中，倦怠正在加剧。工程师们透露，他们需要伪造数据，掩盖缺陷，导致芯片质量受到影响。如今，三星的组织文化被冠以一个讽刺的描述“三星方式”，代指混淆数据和隐瞒问题的不良风气。\n三星擅长的高带宽内存芯片（HBM），对于驱动英伟达用于训练AI模型的尖端硬件至关重要。它在30多年的时间里一直是全球最大的存储芯片制造商，直到今年才被另一家韩国存储芯片巨头SK海力士取代。\n▲2021年~2025年三星、SK海力士、美光科技的DRAM市占率变化（图源：Rest of World）\n三星代工业务也难以与中国台湾最大晶圆代工商台积电竞争。2023年，三星的晶圆代工和芯片设计部门损失了3.18万亿韩元（约合23亿美元、166亿人民币）。\n今年3月，三星集团董事长李在镕告知高管：“三星正面临一场生死攸关的危机。”他承诺进行改革。三星为了提高竞争力，计划对半导体部门进行内部审计。\n一、员工工作越干越多，三星却暂停招聘\n一位在三星工作14年的芯片设计工程师回顾说，随着全球芯片竞争的加速，芯片在技术上取得了更大的进步，但他的工程团队却变得更加精简，过去每个工程师只负责一个部分，但现在要兼顾两三个部分。”\n“照这样下去，我觉得我要死了。”他说，“工程师们的普遍感觉是，我们会在这里工作一段时间，然后去另一家公司。”\n三星的领导层将公司危机与缺乏沟通和等级森严的工作文化联系在一起。去年8月，三星半导体业务主管Jun Young-hyun在一份员工备忘录中写道：“为了度过难关而隐藏或回避问题，只根据充满希望的预期报告不切实际的计划，这种文化已经蔓延开来，并加剧了我们的问题。”\n三星的一位发言人告诉Rest of World，该公司“专注于加强其技术竞争力，培养健康的工作场所文化”。\n三星半导体部门约有7万名员工，分布在一排排玻璃幕墙的办公楼和制造工厂里。它们在华城、基兴和首尔以外的其他工业城市的景观花园中交织而成，这些城市聚集了一些韩国最大的科技公司。\n多位工程师告诉Rest of World，三星选择不填补职位空缺，导致员工手忙脚乱。“意识到自己的处境岌岌可危，三星暂时停止了招聘。”曾在三星做过10年工程师和招聘人员的韩国工业人类学研究所半导体研究员Park Jun-young说。\n过去一年，一位工艺工程师眼睁睁地看着自己团队70多名工程师中有12人离开。他说，直到上个月才开始招聘新员工，更多的工程师因为长期人手不足而退出了他的团队。他向Rest of World透露，管理层知道这个情况，但在危机爆发之前，他们不会主动填补空缺。\n二、逃离三星，跳槽到竞争对手处成为新文化\n就在不久之前，三星还被认为是一份理想的工作，它的员工被称为“三星人”——把与三星的关系当作荣誉徽章的企业精英阶层的成员。\n据一位在三星工作了十年的设备工程师透露，过去，从三星跳槽到竞争对手那里是个禁忌，但现在，公开申请SK海力士已经成为一种文化。\n工程师们说，三星的年轻工程师们正在浏览Blind等职场评价网站，并在即时通讯平台Kakao Talk上的群聊中大量提供求职建议。\n高级工程师们纷纷跳槽到薪水更高、福利更优厚的美国美光、英特尔、苹果、谷歌等海外科技巨头。\n2024年，三星在韩国雇主排名调查中的排名从去年的第二位降至第六位。\n工程师们被要求将加班记录为“非工作”时间，这样三星就不会违反政府规定的每周52小时的工作时间限制。\n在2023年营收大幅下滑后，三星没有向员工发放奖金。工程师们说，去年员工的奖金比疫情高峰期低72%。\n一位三星员工认为，“这就像被削减到工资的1/3”。他说自己曾经渴望加班加点，完成额外的工作，现在则准时打卡下班，因为工作文化已经改变了，即使努力工作，也拿不到任何奖金。\n而三星发言人告诉Rest of World，该公司实施了“明确的基于绩效的薪酬体系，以支持可持续增长”。\n三、官僚主义严重，错误和事故被隐瞒\n人手不足的团队正在承担危险的责任。车间的一名设备工程师告诉Rest World，他一个人上夜班，违反了每班两名工程师的安全协议，同时还要吊起重金属栅格和监控机器人。他整夜在一排排制造设备之间快速奔跑，进行检查。“这就是事故发生的时候，产品开始出现缺陷。”他说。\n三星的发言人则告诉Rest of World，三星致力于提供“严格遵守当地法规的安全工作环境”。\n工程师们将三星的文化描述为“官僚主义”和“等级制度”，并称他们受经理的摆布。反过来，经理们要面对严格的年度绩效评估，这些绩效评估基于诸如产出率、生产成本和缺陷等细粒度指标。\n推卸责任和虚假报告变得司空见惯。两位工程师说，这些经理往往是长期任职的官僚，被提拔是因为他们处理文书工作的能力，而非因为技术能力。三位工程师谈道，他们专注于能够达到年度绩效目标的短期项目。五名工程师称，管理人员还被赋予不切实际的成本削减目标，并将其传递给员工。\n僵化的绩效指标没有给管理者反思、重新调整和追求长期试错的空间，以建立新的东西，反而使他们被迫夸大自己的成就，隐瞒错误和事故，并提出华而不实但行不通的工程计划。\n4名工程师告诉Rest of World，他们经常受到管理人员的压力，要求他们捏造或扭曲数据，以帮助实现这些目标。其中三人称，他们目睹了工程师和管理人员夸大良率，少报缺陷，强行通过不可行的设计。\n一些工程师称，反对等级制度可能会导致糟糕的绩效评估。其他人则认为，这些评估是客观的、基于指标的。\n三星发言人告诉Rest of World，三星“确保与员工的接触是基于公平、透明和灵活的”。\n四、结语：失去士气与竞争优势，三星芯片业务陷入泥潭\n韩国西江大学管理学教授Kim Yong-jin告诉Rest of World，三星已经成长为一个官僚机构，创新速度缓慢。即便SK海力士在开发下一代存储芯片方面投入了大量资金，但三星电子认为，在利基市场上，高昂的开发成本是不合理的。其晶圆代工业务也难以留住客户。然后，AI热潮袭来。\n在反思工作中的问题时，一位设备工程师认为，三星自上而下的文化对工程师的表现和士气产生了反作用，这也许就是三星逐渐丧失竞争优势的原因。\n支持一下 修改",

    "text": "Um restaurante de comida asiática em Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, na Inglaterra, anunciou que mudará de nome após ter sido criticado por utilizar um termo considerado ofensivo à comunidade japonesa: Jap To Go. O restaurante foi inaugurado em dezembro, mas a comunidade local não só não gostou, como passou a pedir pela mudança do nome.\n\"É uma palavra muito ofensiva para os japoneses, então seria apropriado se vocês mudassem o nome e nunca usassem essa palavra para representar o Japão\", disse um usuário em um comentário na página da empresa no Facebook .\nEm entrevista ao portal Daily Mail, a especialista Ruth Taplin, diretora do Centro de Estudos Japoneses e do Leste Asiático, explicou que o termo “Jap” é reconhecido como um insulto racial contra pessoas de origem japonesa, especialmente em contextos históricos ligados à Segunda Guerra Mundial.\nContinuar lendo \"Este é um termo racista e nunca é aceitável usá-lo para se referir ao povo ou à cultura japonesa\", disse Taplin ao Daily Mail. \"Os donos realmente precisam mudar o nome imediatamente e mostrar algum respeito”, acrescentou.\nA proprietária do restaurante, Karim Mansour, disse para o jornal local Manchester Evening News que compreende a insatisfação. Ela também pediu desculpas \"a todos que se sentiram ofendidos\". Segundo Mansour, a intenção original era representar \"Japanese Authentic Perfection\" ou “Perfeição autêntica japonesa”, na tradução literal.\n“Quando inauguramos o Jap To Go nossa intenção não era causar danos. Mas, independentemente do significado original, agora entendemos o impacto que o nome teve\", disse a empreendedora.\nPara o jornal, Mansour também afirmou que sempre “amou e respeitou o povo, a cultura e a comida japonesa”. Além disso, ela destacou que seu objetivo era “celebrar e compartilhar a beleza da culinária e da tradição japonesas com a comunidade local”.\nA empreendedora ainda anunciou que mudará o nome do estabelecimento assim que conseguir reunir recursos suficientes. Ela afirma que, por ser uma pequena empresa, não tem condições de fazer a alteração na velocidade que gostaria, mas que está \"comprometida com a mudança\".\n“Estamos totalmente comprometidos em mudar o nome e seguir em frente com mais cuidado, humildade e respeito”, acrescentou.",
