    "text": "Click to Skip Ahead\nOverview\nOur Experience\nPros & Cons\nKey Features\nAbout HempLucid\nIs it a Good Value?\nHow We Test\nFAQ\nOur Final Verdict We give HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets a rating of 4.85 out of 5 stars\nEffectiveness: 4.7/5 Quality: 4.9/5 Ease of Use: 4.8/5 Value: 5/5 Check Price on HempLucid CBD oil can be a very effective option for treating dogs with chronic or acute anxiety. Of course, to get the most out of these products, you have to use them consistently, which often requires a substantial financial investment. But what if you could find an affordable pet CBD option that was just as effective and pure as the high-priced brands?\nThat’s exactly what the Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets from HempLucid appears to be. This oil is highly concentrated, USDA-certified organic, made from US-grown hemp, and costs a fraction of what the leading pet CBD oil brands do.\nSo, does it work? That’s the question my dog Papyrus and I set out to answer. I have been testing this affordable oil on him for the last three weeks and have been largely impressed with the results. Keep reading to find out if this CBD product is worth the purchase in my full HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets review.\nOverview\nCheck Price on HempLucid Product Type: Pet CBD oil Best Suited For: Pets with anxiety, sleep problems, pain issues, and more Price Range: Very affordable Ingredients: Organic hemp seed oil, chicken flavoring, organic full-spectrum hemp cannabidiol oil, bacon flavoring Concentration: 10mg CBD per ml (300mg CBD per bottle) Options: Chicken flavor – 30ml Spectrum: Full-spectrum hemp oil Storage: Refrigerate after opening Recommended Dose: ½ to 3 droppers, depending on weight Our Experience\nMy fifteen-year-old Chihuahua, Papyrus, has dealt with anxiety his entire life. When I first discovered CBD oil, I felt like I had stumbled on a miracle cure. But dosing my chronically anxious boy twice a day, every day, gets expensive.\nThat’s why I’m always on the lookout for more affordable pet CBD oil options. Of course, these oils also need to be high-quality and effective. This is exactly what HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets promises, which is why I knew I had to test this product out.\nPapyrus was certainly up for the challenge after going without CBD for the last month. Now, after three weeks on HempLucid, he is back to his happy, less anxious self. There is certainly a lot to love about this product as well as some downsides.\nAs far as pet CBD oils go, this one checked an awful lot of boxes. It’s made with organic hemp seed oil and CBD oil, it’s GMP-certified, and the hemp used is grown in my home state of Colorado.\nThis is also a full-spectrum product, which means it has a lot of extra cannabinoids, like CBDV, CBG, and CBC, that help to strengthen the effects of CBD. Of course, this also means it has trace amounts of THC in it. Luckily, though, at around 0.05%, this product is well below the maximum recommended THC percentage for pet products.\nAt 10mg of CBD per dropper, this product has about the perfect concentration for the therapeutic dosing of small and medium dogs.\nPapyrus gets a fairly high dose for a seven-pound Chihuahua, usually around 4 mg twice per day. This equates to just under half a dropper, which is an easy amount to dose and doesn’t add too much extra oil to his diet.\nAs far as getting that dose into him, I found that to be fairly easy as well. I simply added the oil to his breakfast in the mornings and dropped it onto a treat before bedtime to help with his old-man night anxiety.\nOf course, hands down, my favorite part about this oil is the price. This product costs less than many non-organic, low-concentration pet CBD oils that I’ve tried. Considering the quality, amount of CBD per bottle, and purity, it truly is a steal.\nOne unique thing about this organic oil is that it contains two flavor enhancers, chicken and bacon. Despite this, Papyrus was not exactly sold on the taste.\nHe had no problem eating it along with his meals, but he was not a fan of direct dosing. In fact, he was even skeptical about eating his bedtime treat when I put the oil on it. So, if you have a finicky eater, expect to have to mix this oil with their food despite the fact that it’s flavored.\nMy only other big gripe about this oil is that the dropper does not have measurement markers. Since a full milliliter (which is equal to one “dropper full”) is actually ¾ of a dropper, it is hard to eyeball anything less than a full dose. The glass pipette is great, but it would be better if it had markers for pain-free measurements.\nOverall, though, I was very impressed with this oil. It helped bring Papyrus’ anxiety levels down as well as many of the premiere brands we’ve tried but it costs almost half as much as those do. Considering the price, quality, and effectiveness, I would highly recommend this product.\nPros & Cons Pros Organic ingredients Full-spectrum Good concentration for most dogs Third-party lab tested Hemp seed carrier oil Highly affordable Cons No measurement markers on dropper No other concentration options No other flavor options\nKey Features\nCheck Price on HempLucid Made with Quality Ingredients HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets combines USDA organic hemp seed oil with full-spectrum CBD oil for enhanced wellness.\nHemp seed oil, naturally rich in flavonoids and terpenes, is an ideal carrier oil that boosts the effectiveness of CBD. Meanwhile, full-spectrum CBD oil contains minor cannabinoids that work together to maximize CBD’s benefits for the body. Both oils are certified organic, ensuring your pet enjoys a pure, pesticide-free product.\nMade with Hemp Clones Uniquely, HempLucid relies on hemp clones to create their products. Don’t worry, we’re not getting into scary GMO territory here. Rather, these plants are propagated by rooting out branches cut from an established plant.\nThis method of propagation yields an entire crop of hemp plants with the exact same amounts of important compounds, such as CBD. This leads to products that perform the same way bottle after bottle. This means, that if HempLucid works well for your pet, you can count on it to continue to produce the same results every time you use it.\nSurprisingly Affordable This pet CBD oil is among the most budget-friendly options I’ve come across, even outperforming many non-organic products in terms of price. If your dog suffers from chronic issues that require daily dosing, such as anxiety, pain, or neurological disorders, HempLucid offers an affordable and effective solution that’s hard to beat.\nAbout HempLucid\nHempLucid , which got its start in 2016, aims to create quality human and pet CBD products using only US-grown hemp.\nManufacturing: All HempLucid CBD products are made in the USA Sourcing: They source their hemp from organic Colorado farms USDA Organic: Since 2020, HempLucid has maintained USDA-organic certification Testing: All products are third-party independent lab tested Quality Ingredients: No fillers or diluters Is HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets a Good Value? This product stands out for its excellent pricing, especially compared to other quality, organic brands. It’s even more affordable than many non-organic pet CBD oils. And by joining HempLucid’s subscription program, you can enjoy an extra 5% savings on this already budget-friendly option.\nHow We Tested I tested this product by using it as my dog’s only CBD supplement for just over three weeks.\nDuring that time, I used multiple dosing options to get a sense of its ease of use. While Papyrus was not a big fan of straight dosing, he did accept treats with the CBD oil on them. But, by far, I found the easiest option for giving him HempLucid was to add it to his meals.\nDuring this time, I took diligent notes about Papyrus’ anxiety levels, including making notes about the frequency of his nighttime pacing and sleep disturbances.\nAfter about a week, I noticed significant improvements in his symptoms. He seemed much less reactive during the day and slept soundly most nights. This improvement has continued for the last couple of weeks as I’ve continued using the product.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Can I give this product every day? Yes, you can. Thanks to HempLucid’s quality ingredients and third-party verified purity and concentration, you can feel safe giving this product to your pet every day.\nHow much THC is in this product? This full-spectrum product includes less than 0.3% THC, the highest level generally recommended for pet products. Recent lab testing shows the actual THC content is much lower, closer to 0.05%.\nIs this product just for dogs? No, this pet CBD oil can also be used for cats and many other pets. Since some animals are more sensitive to CBD and THC than others, always talk to your vet before starting your pet on CBD.\nCheck Price on HempLucid\nConclusion If you’re searching for an affordable, organic pet CBD oil that delivers real results, HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets is a great choice.\nThis USDA-certified organic oil is not only highly effective but also priced lower than many non-organic options out there. Better still, it’s easy to dose, packs a generous amount of CBD, and is made with quality ingredients that produce consistent results to help your pup get relief from anxiety , pain, and more.",

    "text": "Aryna Sabalenka Was Incredulous After Match Delayed Due to Court Conditions\nWorld No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's Berlin Open match against Rebeka Masarova was delayed for a strange reason. The match was suspended due to wet grass, as the tournament announced Wednesday.\nAnd Sabalenka couldn't believe it. Evidently, Masarova, who lost a hard-fought first set 2-6 moments before play was suspended, complained that the grass was slippery, prompting a discussion between a tournament official and an incredulous Sabalenka.\n\"You’re stopping the match because she said that side is slippery? ... I just played 2 games on that side!\" Sabalenka exclaimed. Sabalenka then seemed to further plead her case, believing that Masarova, who failed to convert all six first set break point chances, was only requesting for play to be stopped because she was losing the match. Former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, providing analysis on The Tennis Channel, certainly believed that to be the case.\nEither way, Sabalenka's pleas fell on deaf ears. The chair umpire suspended the match, not only due to the court conditions but also due to the waning daylight.\nAnd Sabalenka likely won't be the only one upset with the decision. In officially announcing the suspension of the match until Thursday, the Berlin Open also informed fans that tickets for Wednesday's match would not be valid for the resumption of play on Thursday.\nSabalenka, on the heels of losing the French Open final and her somewhat controversial comments after the match, will look to quickly put this match to bed on Thursday and advance to the quarterfinals at the Berlin Open.",

    "title": "Trump Can’t Carry a Gun, but He Might Have the Nuclear Codes Again",
    "text": "Donald Trump’s license to carry a gun is about to be revoked by the New York City Police Department (his concealed carry permit was suspended back in April 2023, after his first indictment was handed down). This is to say, the man who could very well be in charge of the U.S. nuclear arsenal won’t be able to carry a handgun in his home state. On one hand, this is emblematic of the often ridiculous, sometimes amusing, contradictions of America’s federalist system. On the other hand, this is very much a story about Trump, and the unique problems and contradictions his very existence conjures and exposes. Consider a few examples… Many convicted felons are not even eligible to vote , yet tens of millions of Americans will cast their ballots for a convicted felon (Trump) this November. Trump couldn’t get a security clearance on his own merits, and has been indicted for retaining classified documents, yet he could once again be given carte blanche authority to view or declassify any document he sees fit. Trump made his name as a New York businessman, but other civil rulings have curtailed his ability to conduct business there. Trump is a draft dodger who could once again be the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. … I could go on. Did I mention that Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and that he’s still leading Joe Biden in many polls? Presumably, America’s founders never thought such incongruities would matter; they couldn’t have imagined that someone like Trump would get within ten miles of the presidency. But here we are. And if these reports about Trump losing his New York carry license pan out, it will be merely the latest paradoxical development in a saga that has seen Trump lose everything except his political mojo. First, though, it’s worth asking how Trump got his concealed carry license in the first place. New York City’s rules governing such permits are “ incredibly restrictive. ” The answer to this question, no doubt, hinges on privilege. And Trump isn’t the only member of his family to have received preferential treatment regarding gun-related issues. Back in 2019, Donald Trump, Jr. , shot and killed an endangered sheep in Mongolia . Luckily, he was able to retroactively obtain a permit—after meeting with the country’s president. (Kids, don’t try this at home.) Speaking of which, it’s not yet clear whether Trump will be able to own guns in his new home state of Florida. So, as New York magazine’s Chas Danner jibed , “...it’s still possible that Trump could randomly gun someone down in cold blood outside Mar-a-Lago and that his voters might shrug it off as another necessary cost of making America again great. But it appears that innocent bystanders on Fifth Avenue, and everywhere else in New York, are finally safe from this troubling supposed thought experiment.” Jokes aside, the notion that the next commander-in-chief couldn’t legally carry a handgun in New York City serves as yet another stark reminder that times are crazy. And they might get crazier, too, as soon as Trump starts whining about having his Second Amendment rights taken away. To be sure, Trump has secret service protection, so he doesn’t really need a gun for protection. Still, it’s probably only a matter of time before this development becomes part of a conspiracy theory alleging that disarming Trump is the Deep State’s first step—so they can assassinate him . Maybe I shouldn’t give them any more ideas. Besides, why make up scary stories when the truth, itself, is so disturbing. A convicted felon who might not legally be able to carry a gun is a heartbeat away from having his finger on the nuclear button. If you put a gun to my head, I couldn’t vote for him.",

    "text": "New Delhi: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the Centre over the New Delhi Municipal Council's (NDMC) call to seek public opinion on the proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in Delhi and said he wanted to know why the Narendra Modi-led government nurtures such hatred for the Muslims, news agency ANI reported. NDMC, which falls under the Union Ministry of Urban Development, sought suggestions from the people by January 1, on the proposed removal of the mosque. The mosque, situated on a roundabout in central Delhi, has been proposed to be removed on grounds of traffic snarls in the area.\nAccording to reports, the Delhi Waqf Board asserted that they own the land on which the mosque is situated, but the NDMC claims that the government owns the land.\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi said, “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right. It violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture. It also violates section 51-1A of the Waqf Act 1995 which says that acquisition of waqf property can be done only when there is no other option.”\n#WATCH | Hyderabad: On Sunehri Bagh mosque, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi says, \"...This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right... It also violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of… pic.twitter.com/DScW1WjSZJ\n— ANI (@ANI) December 29, 2023\n“When land was acquired in 1911 in Lutyens’, then these heritage structures were left out. We want to know why does the BJP government under PM Narendra Modi nurture such hatred towards Muslims, mosques, and the 'azan'? There is also a place of worship in Nehru Place which leads to traffic snarls. There is no need to remove the Sunehri Masjid. There are so many roundabouts in the city. Why is the government after this one roundabout? We urge the government to withdraw this notification and not disturb the mosques,” Owaisi further said.\nSituated near the Udyog Bhawan, the Sunehri Masjid earned Heritage III status for its historical significance in 2009.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA – December 28, 2023 – “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest.\nAnd most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.\nWhere to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God.\nDr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org\nMost of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct quotes from the Real Reality, and this is one such quote pertaining to war:\n“On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life’s nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed ‘planet Zero,’ hanging in an ‘impossible’ position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people’s internals …\nAll the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?”\nAnd this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer:\n“Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.”\nThe question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace.\nDr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org).\nAn example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website:\n“In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don’t need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion ‘can be fun’ if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.”\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name:\nAscot Media Group, Inc.\nContact Person: Gloria Gonzalez\nEmail:\nSend Email\nPhone: 281.333.3507\nAddress:Post Office Box 2394\nCity: Friendswood\nState: TX 77549\nCountry: United States\nWebsite:\nhttp://www.ascotmedia.com/",

Image : X/Waly Dia\nL’affiche du prochain spectacle de l’humoriste Waly Dia ne sera pas installée dans les stations du métro parisien. Selon Le Monde, la régie publicitaire de la RATP et de la SNCF considère que le visuel du stand-up « Une heure à tuer » (que l’humoriste jouera à partir du 1er février au Théâtre de l’Œuvre à Paris) « présente un caractère politique incompatible avec le devoir de neutralité qui s’impose dans les transports publics et pourrait être considérée comme diffamatoire ou injurieuse ».\nL’affiche représente le visage de l’humoriste grenoblois, tatoué de phrases et de petits dessins. Or deux phrases posent problème à la RATP : celle inscrite sur sa joue droite, « Je suis comme l’IGPN, je ne suis pas là pour faire le procès des policiers », et celle inscrite à la base de son cou, « Macron, c’est comme un père alcoolique, à la maison il te pourrit la vie, dehors il te fout la honte ».\nLa directrice de la communication de la régie publicitaire a expliqué à nos confrères que « tout message présentant un caractère politique est prohibé dans les espaces que (la RATP) commercialise ».\nL’artiste refuse d’enlever les phrases Waly Dia et ses producteurs ont refusé de retirer les deux phrases, jugées problématiques par la RATP. Les usagers du métro parisien ne pourront donc pas apprécier l’humour politique du chroniqueur de l’émission de Charline Vanhoenacker sur France Inter.\nQuant à Waly Dia, il s’est amusé de cette situation sur les réseaux sociaux. « C’est ma faute, j’ai confondu MediaTransports (la régie publicitaire de la RATP) et Mediapart », a-t-il notamment raillé.",

Los dos futbolistas valencianistas sufren un proceso vírico-gripal que les ha impedido entrenarse esta mañana con el resto de sus compañeros, tras [hacerlo ayer por la tarde, en Mestalla](https://as.com/futbol/primera/gaya-de-regreso-ante-medio-mestalla-n/). No obstante, tanto el mediocentro, que regresa tras cumplir dos partidos de sanción, como el delantero centro, deben estar recuperados para afrontar el derbi de la Comunitat Valenciana el próximo martes, ante el Submarino. Como viene siendo habitual en los tres últimos meses, tampoco ha estado en la sesión André Almeida, quien tiene una fractura en una vértebra y no tiene fecha prevista de vuelta. Diakhaby ha sido el otro ausente, aunque el franco-guineano, que cumplirá su partido de sanción ante el Villarreal, ya no se le espera hasta finales de enero ya que se marcha a la Copa de África. En el plano positivo está de nuevo José Luis Gayà, que ha vuelto a entrenarse esta mañana con normalidad. El capitán, si no surge ningún contratiempo de última hora será de la partida ante el Villarreal tras tener que parar varios partidos por diversas molestias. El lateral ha trabajado a buen ritmo y ya es uno más del grupo.
