    "title": "FFRF warns Missouri school district over civil rights violations",
    "text": "The Freedom From Religion Foundation is warning the Francis Howell School District of many constitutional and statutory rights it risks violating if it adopts two anti-transgender policies at today’s meeting.\nFFRF’s Equal Justice Works Fellow Kat Grant and Patrick O’Reiley Legal Fellow Hirsh M. Joshi wrote to the district’s board of education that proposed anti-trans policies violate Title IX, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment and Missouri state laws.\n“That is an unholy trifecta of laws being violated,”\nthe duo wrote.\nPolicy 2116 would require that students use the bathroom conforming to the sex markers on their birth certificates. The second is Regulation 6116, which would prohibit district employees or contracted personnel from discussing human sexuality with any students except when part of a “group discussion of current events….”\nThe adoption of these policies present potential issues with the Establishment Clause separating state and church.\nIn a 2023 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that there is a major network of primarily conservative Christian organizations such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Heritage Foundation, and Focus on the Family behind the large volume of misinformation and pseudoscience being disseminated about transgender people. These policies not only restrict district employees from being able to engage in understandings of gender and gender identity outside of the one being advanced by these religious organizations, but also require them to coerce students into complying with a single theological understanding of these topics. This goes far beyond what is permissible under both the First Amendment and the Missouri Constitution.\n“The Constitution does not fall short of transgender students. On the whole, both provisions that FHSD’s Board will consider today are unlawful, unenforceable, and greatly increase the litigation risk the District assumes. The district should vote against both policies, or risk litigation,” the pair concluded.\n“George Washington once said that the ‘Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, persecution no assistance,’” adds Joshi, a Missouri-licensed attorney. “Defiantly, Francis Howell’s School Board gives the bigots and persecutors a pretty safe home. That’s pretty on-brand for Missouri. These school board members are just school bullies.”\n“Transgender rights are serving as a proxy war for Christian nationalist ideals surrounding gender roles and bodily autonomy, and courts across the country have taken different stances on the constitutionality of banning gender-affirming health care,” notes Grant, whose fellowship projects tackle the intersection of LGBTQIA-plus rights and state/church separation. “But to go after queer kids, who are still figuring things out, and are more likely to be bullied by their peers anyways? That’s a different kind of animus and hatred.”\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation is a national nonprofit organization with over 40,000 members across the country, including more than 400 in Missouri. Our purposes are to protect the constitutional principle of separation between state and church, and to educate the public on matters relating to nontheism.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Frederick County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Frederick County, Virginia from 1901-2000 was 33.0. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Frederick County, Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Frederick County, Virginia history.",

    "title": "Allegations of Forced Conversion: Nurses in Karnataka's Kalaburagi District Under Investigation",
    "text": "In the heart of Karnataka's Kalaburagi district, a controversy brews that touches on the delicate balance between faith and coercion, raising questions about the role of healthcare workers in rural India's complex social fabric. At the center of this storm are two nurses, Ashwini and Rubika, employed at the government-run Primary Health and Welfare Centre in Ratkal village, Kalagi taluk, who now find themselves accused of attempting religious conversions.\nA Complaint That Stirs Communal Tensions\nThe saga began when the Hindu Jagruthi Sene lodged a police complaint against the nurses, accusing them of offering money to convert people to Christianity. The allegations suggest a scenario where religious preachers were invited to the hospital premises to preach the Bible, an act that the complaint describes as spreading anti-Hindu propaganda and engaging in religious conversion activities. This incident, as reported, has not only spotlighted the accused but has also ignited concerns over communal unrest in the area. The Ratkal police have taken up the case, marking the start of an inquiry that delves into these serious allegations.\nBetween Service and Allegations\nThe role of nurses, especially in rural healthcare settings, is pivotal. Tasked with providing care and comfort to their patients, nurses like Ashwini and Rubika represent the frontline of India's healthcare system in remote areas. The accusations leveled against them highlight a troubling intersection of religious belief and public service, raising questions about the influence of personal faith in professional settings. The complaint, while specific in its allegations, opens a broader dialogue about the expectations and boundaries of healthcare providers in multicultural and multi-religious societies like India.\nThe Path Ahead\nThe legal and social implications of this case are significant. With the police investigation underway, the focus will be on gathering evidence to support or refute the allegations. The outcome has the potential to not only affect the lives and careers of Ashwini and Rubika but also to influence public perception of religious conversion efforts within governmental institutions. Furthermore, this incident brings to the forefront the delicate balance between religious freedom and the imposition of beliefs, a topic that resonates deeply in India's pluralistic society.\nThe narrative unfolding in Kalaburagi district is more than a legal battle; it's a reflection of the broader challenges facing India as it navigates the complexities of faith, freedom, and the role of public servants in upholding secular values amidst diverse religious beliefs. As the investigation progresses, it remains to be seen how this case will influence discussions on religious activities in public spaces and the secular commitments of government employees. The resolution of this controversy holds the potential to set precedents for how such delicate matters are handled in the future, impacting not just the individuals involved but also the fabric of communal harmony in the region.",

    "text": "The Guardian Pope Francis’s small step on gay rights should be welcomed Read full article The Guardian December 29, 2023 at 8:14 p.m. · 1 min read Photograph: Maria Grazia Picciarella/REX/Shutterstock I appreciate Matt Cain’s heartfelt piece in response to the pope’s blessing of same-sex relationships ( So Pope Francis has deigned to ‘bless’ gay couples? That’s not a blessing, it’s an insult, 19 December ). I agree that it does not go far enough. But some perspective from my training as a chaplain in a Catholic hospital informs my understanding. Querying the head of pastoral care, I asked when the church would ordain women. He concurred it would happen, likely in “300 years”. This is glacial terrain when it comes to major change. I believe that Pope Francis understands that the church has to go in incremental steps. Acceptable, no, but understandable, given the context.\nRev Mark Chaffin\nTroy, New York, US\n• While I understand the annoyance expressed in Matt Cain’s piece, it is a reaction that frustrates me. The problem with “all or nothing” is that we always end up with nothing. Why not accept and even congratulate the church for its small step, then support liberals in the church for more progress? The moral high ground may feel good, but it’s often lonely and can reek of petulance.\nAnthony Watts\nStrathfield , New South Wales, Australia\n• Matt Cain might have reflected on the Chinese aphorism that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Against all the odds, Pope Francis has taken that single step and surely deserves support, not vitriolic condemnation.\nJG Moorhead\nGorstage, Cheshire\n• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

    "text": "Palestinian Christians held a somber Christmas vigil in Bethlehem on Saturday, with candlelight hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations at the site where they believe Jesus Christ was born.\nMost years Bethlehem is “swamped” with people.\nSome 2,000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the famous site of this stable in the Byzantine-era Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where most Christmases there are cheerful lights and trees in Manger Square.\nChristians make up about 2% of the population in all of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories\nBut as Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 20,000 people, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, the mainly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank is also in mourning.\nThis year they decided not to have a big tree, the usual focus of Bethlehem’s Christmas celebrations, because of the massacre that took place just 50 kilometers away.\nAnd in place of the usual nativity scene, Bethlehem churches this year placed figures of Mary and Jesus among the rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n“This Christmas is coming to Bethlehem differently. Today Bethlehem, like every other Palestinian city, is mourning. We feel sadness,” said the city’s mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square.",
