    "text": "Why church leaders are not doing well, by Reverend Aina\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Christian Leadership Skills Incorporated, Reverend Albert Aina, has said that church leaders are not doing well today because they lack adequate training on how to manage people and church administration, arguing that many of them are preoccupied with what he described as A. B. C. which according to him, means attendance, building and cash.\nAina called on church leaders to see beyond attendance, building and cash, and embrace the latest trend in church management, which his organisation is offering to church leaders in conjunction with McPherson University, Ogun State, where some church leaders are doing a three-month course majorly designed for general overseers, district overseers, pastors’ wives, church workers, among others.\nSpeaking atthe graduation of the pioneer students of the Executive Diploma in Church Management at McPherson University Campus in Ogun State, Ainasaid some church leaders elevate anointing more than sound management training.\nDisclosing that only one out of five pastors are trained today, the church growth expert noted that this is a major challenge to the church.\nHe said: “Some church leaders are far removed from reality because from my findings anointing alone is not enough for churches to succeed, anointing gathers people, it takes sound management training to retain people.\n“A pastor’s success is 60 percent dependent on human relations and from our research 60 percent of pastors have problem with church management. Some do not have plans for succession, some do not have plans to even retain young people that is why this programme is very relevant. Some general overseers have no idea of how to manage their money and accountability is lacking. This programme brings accountability to the fore.”\nAina described church as a public trust and not personal ownership, condemning general overseers for turning the church as their personal property.\n“The period that general overseers are said to own churches has passed. Individuals do not own Churches; the church is a public trust and must be managed with well laid down rules and regulations. Here, we show church leaders how to manage their weekend programmes, their finances and church planting; we teach them stewardship and talents.”\nNot every body that can pastor a church, many general overseers are not doing well because they had the calling of a founder, but not the training of the general overseer, so, not all G.O.s can succeed except they are trained on skill management.\n“Lack of training limits church growth. Only one out of five pastors are trained today and it is major problem. 80 percent of what they are being taught is not usable. Pastors today are concerned with A.B.C — attendance, building and cash, so the programme is to provide paradigm shift. They should see beyond attendance, building and cash.”\nThe Vice Chancellor, McPherson University, Ogun State, Prof. Francis Igbasan, who was so happy that the varsity has successfully certified and approved 42 students of Executive Diploma in Church Management to be part of its convocation ceremonies scheduled for February 28, 2025, at the university’s campus, described the institution as a place to study.\nHe said: “My predecessor signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Christian Leadership Skills Incorporated to facilitate this Executive Diploma in Church Management and we thank God that the programme is taking off with the first set of regular students graduating on February 28, 2025.”\nHe recommended the programme for every church leader that wants to make a difference in his or her church.\nGet the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.

    "text": "A viral selfie shared by Rahul Gandhi, featuring him and Sonia Gandhi displaying their inked fingers after voting, has stirred controversy due to a frame in the background. Netizens speculated it depicted Jesus Christ, but a fact-check revealed otherwise. Upon closer examination, it has been revealed to be a historic painting titled &quot;Madonna Oriflamma.&quot; Created in 1932, this painting combines elements from East and West, depicting the Virgin Mary in the style of the Italian Renaissance alongside Buddhas in meditation. Additionally, it features the three orbs, symbolising the Roerich Peace Pact, as per Russian painter Nicholas Roerich&#039;s vision. The post aimed at urging citizens to vote garnered attention for the misinterpretation of the historic painting adorning the room of the Congress leader, falsely calling it a pic of Jesus Christ.

    "text": "You've heard of Santa, maybe even Krampus, but what about the child-eating Yule Cat? Christmas time is upon us, and though children loathe getting new clothes for gifts, they best put on that new itchy sweater or slide on those unwanted socks. Or else risk being eaten alive by a giant cat, at least according to Icelandic folklore. That's right. A child's worst nightmare — new clothes under the tree — could only be outdone by a somehow worse nightmare, being devoured by a ferocious feline that hunts down children caught not wearing their new clothes. The tale of Jólakötturinn, which translates to Yule Cat, is an Icelandic Christmas classic dating back to at least 1932, according to the [Icelandic Folklore website](https://icelandicfolklore.is/the-yule-cat/), a research project managed by the University of Iceland. Jóhannes úr Kötlum, an Icelandic poet, wrote about the Yule Cat in his book, Jólin koma (Christmas is Coming), published in 1932. Kötlum's poem tells the tale of a cat that's \"very large\" with glowing eyes. It roams the countryside, going from house to house looking for children who aren't wearing the new clothes they got for Christmas, according to the poem. Memes of the Yule Cat have been making their way around social media, some are meant to be spooky, while others are a blend of fascination and satire. \"I am really fascinated by other culture's holiday traditions so shoutout to my boy the Yule Cat,\" one [meme reads](https://www.instagram.com/p/C09dA7tOVql/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). \"A monstrous cat who roams Iceland eating people who aren't wearing the clothes they got for Christmas.\" The Yule Cat isn't the only sinister character that comes around Christmas. Another European folklore character is Krampus, an anti-Santa demon that kidnaps and punishes naughty kids, according to [mythology.net](https://mythology.net/demons/krampus/). Munich, Germany, hosts an annual [Krampus run](https://www.berchtesgaden.de/en/folk-traditions/buttnmandl-and-krampus), which attracts hundreds of participants — and more spectators — every year.

    "title": "A defiant Fani Willis appears to call out her critics in Trump case in speech at Black church",
    "text": "Fani Willis called out her critics in a defiant speech Thursday at a Black church outside Atlanta, not naming names but appearing to refer to Donald Trump and others who have attacked the Georgia prosecutor's investigation of the former president's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, obtained an indictment last year against Trump and 18 of his allies. She has faced months of criticism over her handling of the case — with some of the attacks playing on racist or sexist tropes — as well as for hiring a special prosecutor, now off the case, with whom she had a romantic relationship. Recommended Videos Speaking to a gathering of Black church clergy and congregants, Willis said friends often express concern for her. “I live the experience of a Black woman who is attacked and oversexualized,” she said. “See, I’m so tired of hearing these idiots call my name as ‘fanny’ in a way to attempt to humiliate me because, like silly school boys, the name reminds them of a woman’s rear, of her behind.” Trump has used that pronunciation to mock Willis — whose first name is pronounced FAH'-nee — notably during a rally in Ohio in March when he said “fanny, like your ass,\" when talking about her name. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Willis said her father, “a strong, educated, conscious Black man,” gave her the name Fani Taifa, which she said means “prosperous people” in Swahili. Willis' outspokenness in response to critics is not new. But her out-of-court statements have been seized on by defense attorneys for Trump and drawn admonishment from the judge in the case, which is mostly on hold as a Georgia appeals court reviews whether she should be allowed to stay on it. At the annual planning meeting of the Georgia AME church, Willis told the crowd gathered in the sanctuary of a church in suburban Marietta that friends often express concern about the attacks on her but that she shakes off the ugliness. “What I'm here to tell you is to not concern yourself with insults of me. I promise you, I don't concern myself with them,” she told the supportive audience, drawing shouted affirmations throughout her 25-minute remarks. “I am too busy working 15-hour days trying to use every talent God gave me to fulfill my God-given purpose.” Willis also said that she works hard “to hold all — all, there are no exceptions — who dare to come into our community and break the law accountable.” That mirrors her standard response when she's asked about prosecuting a former president — that no one is above the law. The August indictment accuses Trump and the others of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. Republican lawmakers in Atlanta and Washington have targeted her since the indictment, opening investigations into her office. She has had a particularly barbed exchange with U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who has questioned her motivations and demanded that she produce records. She appeared to take another swipe at Jordan Thursday, saying, “We have politicians that spend no time doing their elected purpose. In fact, we got a clown in Washington D.C. who's been elected for the purpose to make his community safer and pass laws. But he's been sitting there for 17 years and passed zero laws.” Jordan entered Congress in 2007, 17 years ago. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Defense attorneys for Trump and others have pointed to a speech Willis gave at a historic Black church in Atlanta in January, saying she inappropriately inserted race and God into the case, potentially prejudicing potential jurors against their clients. Those arguments have come in an ongoing effort to get Willis and her office removed from the election interference prosecution or to have the case dismissed entirely. The Willis removal effort began with the revelation that she had had a romantic relationship with attorney Nathan Wade , whom she had hired as a special prosecutor for the case. Defense attorneys argued that Willis improperly profited from the case when Wade used his earnings to take her on vacation, resulting in a conflict of interest. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March ruled that there was not a conflict that should force Willis off the case, but he said there was an “appearance of impropriety.” He allowed Willis to remain on the case as long as Wade did not, and the special prosecutor resigned hours later. The Georgia Court of Appeals last month agreed to take up the case and lawyers for Trump earlier this week asked the court to hear oral arguments. Willis' team on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing there is insufficient evidence to support reversing the lower court’s order. The case against Trump and the other eight defendants involved in the appeal has been halted by the appeals court while it reviews the lower court ruling. That means the case against Trump, one of four criminal cases against the former president , almost definitely will not proceed to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.",

    "text": "At an emergency summit on 1 February, EU leaders did not make a decision to establish a special fund for military support of Ukraine, but European Council President Charles Michel says progress has been made.\nThe standoff reflects broader debates over sustaining arms supplies to Ukraine long-term, amplified by US congressional holdups and the possibility of a Trump comeback.\nIn a section concerning military support for Ukraine in a\nstatement released after the summit, the European Council emphasized the commitment to continue providing Ukraine with “timely, predictable and stable military support” through the European Peace Facility, the work of the EU training mission for the Ukrainian military, and bilateral assistance.\nHowever, no decision has been made regarding the creation of the Ukraine Assistance Fund within the European Peace Facility, as President Zelenskyy\nimplored via video link during the meeting. The special €20 billion fund is intended to provide stable military support to Ukraine over four years; the issue of its creation is planned to be resolved by March.\nThe conclusions state that the Council of the EU aims to reach an agreement on creating the Ukraine Assistance Fund by early March by way of amendments to the 2021 Council Decision establishing the European Peace Facility.\nAt the same time, European Council President Charles Michel noted that “progress” has been made on this issue.\nAfter almost 2 years of war, Ukraine remains and will remain a priority.\nWe will continue our strong military assistance. Progress has been made in supporting Ukraine through the 🇪🇺Peace Facility and we will leave no effort spared to accelerate the delivery of ammunition to 🇺🇦…\n[pic.twitter.com/eZQfoECv1T]\n— Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel)\n[February 1, 2024]\nThe statement confirmed the EU’s commitment to continue providing military support to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility, EU Military Assistance Mission in Ukraine, and bilateral military commitments of individual EU countries.\nThe conclusions also emphasize the “urgent need to accelerate the delivery of ammunition and missiles” in view of the commitment to provide Ukraine with one million artillery shells. EU leaders called on member states “to explore all options to meet Ukraine’s needs.”\nEU High Representative Josep Borrelll originally proposed the four-year Ukraine Aid Fund in summer 2023, with €5 billion allocated annually.\nThe idea was revamped in January 2024, as the European Union\nproposed establishing a Ukraine Assistance Fund to streamline military aid to Ukraine. The fund would have an annual budget of approximately €5 billion focused on joint procurement of weapons and training Ukrainian troops. This initiative aimed to shift from the current model of reimbursing EU states for supplies sent to Ukraine.\nAccording to\nReuters, the proposal for creating the Ukraine Assistane Fund gas faced resistance from Germany and France.\nAt the center of the debate is the mechanism of operation of the European Peace Facility (EPF), which has been used to provide billions of euros in military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion.\nThe EPF operates as a reimbursement scheme, with EU members contributing according to their economic size and receiving payouts based on the amount of aid donated.\nThe fund has been pivotal in enabling the EU bloc to supply offensive weapons to Ukraine for the first time. But divisions have emerged among members over the EPF’s future role as the war continues, Reuters says.\nSome nations see the EPF as an effective means of channeling long-term assistance to Kyiv and a model for greater EU defense integration. However, controversies have also arisen, with members clashing over claimed refunds.\nMost EU countries support injecting €5 billion into the EPF to further help Ukraine. But Germany wants changes to the fund first, and approval has been held up for months.\nGermany has voiced concerns about its disproportionate contributions to the EPF while also providing billions in bilateral military aid to Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said most EU nations were not providing enough support to Kyiv. On 28 January, Scholz\nurged EU member nations to provide more aid to Ukraine, with Germany committing €7 billion in 2024, accounting for over half of the bloc’s total funding.\nGermany and France have called for the EPF to be reformed before being expanded.\nThe standoff highlights debates over how to sustain EU military aid for Kyiv on an institutionalized, long-term basis. Though reaffirming their commitment, leaders have struggled to transform the bloc’s ad hoc approach, Reuters reports.\nHungary initially opposed the creation of the fund, but on 25 January,\nagreed to drop its objections.\nRelated:",

Fondamentale è stata poi l'istituzione sempre con legge regionale del Parco Regionale dei Colli Euganei, soggetto che lo scorso aprile è diventato Ente gestore del sito della rete Natura 2000. Il Veneto con oggi conta ben quattro riserve MAB: Po Grande, Delta del Po, Monte Grappa e Colli Euganei. Sono per noi un traguardo ma al contempo rappresentano una sfida continua che ci chiama a trovare incessantemente il giusto bilanciamento tra uomo e ambiente tutelando biodiversità e sviluppo sostenibile\". \"Ringrazio - aggiunge Corazzari - il presidente del Parco Colli Alessandro Frizzarin, ente proponente della candidatura per l'importante lavoro svolto, e tutti i soggetti che hanno creduto in questo progetto, raccontando al mondo l'unicità del territorio dei nostri Colli Euganei, area che vanta un ricco patrimonio naturale e culturale legato alla sua storia vulcanica e alle sue acque termali\". Il sito proposto comprende 15 comuni in provincia di Padova con una popolazione complessiva di 111.368 abitanti; si estende in parte nel parco regionale dei Colli Euganei (il più antico in Veneto) e in parte in altre aree esterne al Parco ma incluse nell'elenco delle zone speciali di conservazione a livello europeo. -foto ufficio stampa Regione Veneto - (ITALPRESS). mgg/com 05-Lug-24 16:08 .",

    "text": "Hostelworld reported “robust” booking growth across many regions of the world ahead of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year. The OTA highlighted demand for trips to hostels in Central America, South Asia and southern European countries. Net bookings rose by 64% year-on-year to 3.4 million with revenue up by an identical percentage to a record €45.8 million in the six months to June 30. First half losses halved to €7.5 million from €14.3 million in the same period last year. The company estimated global hostel sales measured in bed nights increased by 14% year-on-year, driven by modest increases in occupancy rates and capacity. Hostelworld said: “During the first six months of the year, we have seen strong year-on-year growth in our business as our customers booked their hostelling trips around the world again.” Chief executive Gary Morrison added: “By geography, Europe has recorded strong year-over-year growth overall, with revenue growth outpacing net bookings growth through continued bed price inflation. “Bookings into southern Europe and other low-cost destinations such as Central America and South Asia have also been exceptionally strong, exceeding pre Covid-19 levels.” Hostelworld reiterated plans to grow its market coverage over the coming years by adding more hostels to its platform in key markets around the world. The firm confirmed guidance of adjusted earnings [ebitda] in the range of €16.5 million to €17 million for the full year, “absent any deterioration in the macro-economic climate, the re-introduction of travel restrictions or other air travel related disruptions”.",

    "title": "Harris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy - and makes 'surrender proposals' swipe at Trump | US News | Sky News",
    "text": "Kamala Harris has hit out at opponents making \"proposals for surrender\" in Ukraine - making a thinly veiled criticism of Donald Trump. The US vice president and Democratic candidate for president said some want Ukraine to strike peace with Russia by accepting neutrality and foregoing security relationships with other nations during a news conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. US election latest: Harris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy \"Ukraine has stood up to Russia's aggression and today Kyiv stands free and strong. President Zelenskyy, I am clear,\" she said. \"Putin started this war and he could end it tomorrow if he simply withdrew his troops from Ukraine's sovereign territory.\" Hinting at Mr Trump's recent comments saying Ukraine should have taken \"a bad deal,\" Ms Harris added: \"They are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender. \"The US can not and should not isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. Isolation is not insulation.\" Mr Trump has said he will meet with Mr Zelenskyy on Friday in a post on Truth Social. It comes a day after the former president suggested Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before the war started. At a campaign rally in North Carolina, Mr Trump said: \"The worst deal would've been better than what we have now. If they made a bad deal, it would've been much better. \"They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built, and every tower would be ageing for another 2,000 years.\" \"What deal can we make? It's demolished,\" he added. \"The people are dead. The country is in rubble.\" Mr Trump has also previously claimed he would end the war in Ukraine the same day he retakes office - but has also condemned Russia's invasion. Zelenskyy calls for more air defence Meanwhile, Mr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's air defences need to be \"urgently strengthened\" to \"save thousands of lives and reduce Russian terror to zero\". \"We have to end this war, we need a just peace. We must protect our people: Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children and everyone from Putin's evil,\" he said at the White House. His appearance came after a meeting with Joe Biden, where the US president announced a \"surge\" in military support for Ukraine. The new package includes long-desired glide bombs, air defence kit, and more training for Ukrainian pilots, but it did not come with permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia. Recent weeks have seen Mr Zelenskyy pushing the US and other Western allies for permission to use longer-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia. So far the Pentagon and White House have not green-lit the loosening of restrictions. There has been hesitation amid concerns over an escalation, which Russia has warned of. With 40 days to go until the election, next for Ms Harris is a visit to a border entry facility in Douglas, Arizona. Sky's partner network NBC News reported she will receive \"official briefings on operations and progress on disrupting the flow of fentanyl through the southern border,\" according to an official from her office. Meanwhile, Mr Trump is meeting with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Trump Tower in New York. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir reiterated he wanted to meet both Mr Trump and Ms Harris ahead of the November vote.",
