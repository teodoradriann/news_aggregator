    "text": "This Pear Salad combines candied walnuts, mixed greens, fresh pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan cheese, drizzled with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. So fresh and flavor-packed, this salad is bound to become a new favorite.\nThis is one of our all-time favorite salads. This salad is quick and easy, even with the homemade dressing. It is a must-try for all pear lovers and a tasty blend of flavors and textures. I love to serve this salad with grilled chicken , baked cod , pan-fried pork chops , grilled shrimp , and even salmon patties .\nIngredient Notes and Substitutions Nuts : You can substitute pecans for the walnuts. Just follow the same directions for candying them. Balsamic vinegar : They sell white balsamic vinegar, which is more aesthetically pleasing on this salad. Salad greens : Use spring greens or mixed greens like arugula, baby spinach, baby greens Pears : You can use any kind of pear with this salad such as Bosc, Anjou, and Bartlett. Cranberries : Try dried cherries, apricots, and blueberries, and pomegranate ariels instead of the dried cranberries. They are all equally delicious. Parmesan cheese : You can substitute blue cheese or feta cheese. How to make Pear Salad Combine the walnuts, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir to coat. Cover a small baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Spread the walnuts out in a single layer. Bake the walnuts at 300 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through baking. Let them cool before adding them to the salad.\nWhile the walnuts are baking, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, honey, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, and olive oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\nIn a large serving bowl, add the mixed greens and candied walnuts. Slice the pears thinly and brush the flesh with lemon juice. Add the pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan. Drizzle with the balsamic vinaigrette and toss to coat. Serve promptly.\nPreparation Tips You can make the salad dressing up to 3 days in advance and store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Most grocery stores carry a prepackaged spring mix blend. This tender vegetation makes a fabulous salad, but watch your expiration dates as the leaves break down faster than a good, sturdy romaine or head of iceberg lettuce. Brush the sliced pears with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown before you are ready to serve. Recipe Variations Nuts : try pecans, almonds, or cashews, either candied or not Fruit : try dried cherries, dried apricots, dried blueberries, and pomegranate ariels instead of the dried cranberries, or substitute sliced apples for the pears. Cheese : try feta cheese, blue cheese, gorgonzola, or goat cheese. Meat : add crispy cooked chopped bacon, grilled chicken breasts , or smoked salmon. Storage This salad is best enjoyed after the vinaigrette is drizzled and tossed on the salad. That being said, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge, but try to enjoy it as soon as possible.\nMore Salad Recipes Asian Cucumber Salad Asian Chopped Salad Grilled Chicken Salad Cucumber Tomato Salad German Cucumber salad Pear Salad with Walnuts and Parmesan Cheese This Pear Salad combines candied walnuts, mixed greens, fresh pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan cheese, all drizzled with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. 5 from 16 votes Print\nPin Rate Course: lunch, Salad, side Cuisine: American Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes Cook Time: 20 minutes minutes Servings: 6 Calories: 475 kcal Author: Beth Pierce Ingredients Candied Walnuts 1 cup walnuts 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon sea salt Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing 2 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 garlic clove minced 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Pear Salad 7 ounces mixed salad greens 2 ripe pears 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup dried cranberries 1/2 cup shaved parmesan Instructions Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

    "text": "Con voladuras controladas La brutal técnica de demolición de Israel en Gaza, o cómo destruir una población a través de barrios, universidades u hospitales Las fuerzas israelíes, en respuesta a la pérdida de 21 soldados israelíes, han desencadenado una ola de demoliciones controladas en Gaza. \"Vamos a volar estas 21 casas de terroristas en vuestra memoria\", anunciaron antes de apretar el detonador, dejando tras de sí escombros y devastación. Esta brutal táctica se ha convertido en algo habitual, con 33 demoliciones similares desde el inicio de la guerra, según revela una investigación del 'The New York Times'. Desde el inicio del conflicto, más de la mitad de los edificios de Gaza han sido dañados o destruidos, y las demoliciones controladas se han destacado como algunos de los episodios más destructivos. En Kuzha, al sur de Gaza, 200 viviendas fueron eliminadas en una operación masiva, mientras que un barrio residencial a las afueras de la ciudad también sufrió una demolición de gran escala. El Ejército israelí justifica estas acciones alegando la destrucción de infraestructuras terroristas. El impacto de estas demoliciones se extiende a lugares estratégicos, como cerca de un hospital importante y la céntrica Plaza Palestina. El mapa revela puntos rojos que marcan las confirmadas demoliciones, predominantemente lejos de la llamada \"zona de amortiguamiento\". Un área que Israel ha decidido despojar de habitantes para evitar futuros ataques.

    "title": "To Your Good Health: Bird lover is troubled over the possible transmission of bird flu",
    "text": "I have two bird feeders off my back deck. They hang from tall poles as a vain attempt to keep squirrels from eating all of the birdseed. But to refill them, I must take them down and handle them, and I recently wondered if I might be exposing myself to the new bird flu. Is there any information about this possibility? Any possible transmission of the virus might have occurred to other bird lovers, too.\nThe songbirds you are attracting to your feeders, such as cardinals, sparrows and woodpeckers, are not likely to be infected with avian influenza, or “bird flu.” It generally infects waterfowl such as gulls and ducks.\nMost experts do not recommend taking down your feeders, but do recommend a periodic cleaning of feeders and baths with a diluted bleach — 10% — solution. You should wash your hands after refilling your feeders.\nThose who keep poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese or turkeys — which may also be infected by bird flu — should not use feeders or baths that attract wild birds.\nI see commercials about different kinds of pillows, asserting that they are better for you medically in various ways, especially with enhancing your sleep experience. This implies to me that conventional pillows can be bad for you. Is any of this true?\nNo, I wouldn’t say that conventional pillows are bad for you. However, there is evidence that in people with chronic neck pain, pillows made with latex or springs have been shown to reduce neck pain, waking symptoms and disability.\nThey also enhance the satisfaction that people have with their pillows, but studies taken as an aggregate did not show an improvement in sleep quality. It seems that the height and composition of the pillow can affect the alignment of your neck bones.\nIf you aren’t having any problems, there is no reason to change. But if you wake up with a sore neck or have chronic neck pain, a special pillow might help, although I doubt there is one pillow that is right for everybody.\nIs it OK for an 80-year-old male who has abused alcohol for many years — six to eight drinks per evening — to stop drinking cold turkey? I have not slept in 48 hours!\nNo, it’s not OK. It’s very unsafe for anyone to stop drinking so much so quickly, especially an older adult.\nWhat you should have done is gotten in contact with your regular physician who can determine if it is safe for you to stop alcohol at home, or whether you need to be in a more supervised situation — such as a person with heart problems or those with a history of severe alcohol withdrawal in the past.\nIf it is safe for you to do so at home, medication to help prevent withdrawal symptoms may be given. An expert in addiction medicine has more experience than nearly all generalists, so your regular physician may recommend that you see an expert.\nGiven your symptoms, you should see someone right away, whether they’re your own doctor or an emergency physician, as you are at risk for moderate or severe withdrawal.\nI congratulate you on wanting to stop alcohol after many years, but getting some help will make stopping safer and make quitting for good more likely.",

    "title": "Wages are up, yet life is still unaffordable: Top economist explains why",
    "text": "Wages under the current federal government have risen at a higher rate than previous governments over the past three decades, yet the average Tasmanian is arguably struggling more than they ever have over that time. Under the Albanese government, which came to office just two years ago, wages have gone up 3.8 per cent a year, while under the previous Liberal government, wages went up 2.2 per cent a year. Under the Labor government before that, wages rose by 3.5 per cent per annum, and under the Howard government - which held power the longest of any government over the past 28 years - wages went up 3.6 per cent a year. Tasmanian economist Saul Eslake said Tasmanian wages rose 5.1 per cent over the year to the June quarter, faster than any other state or territory, mainly because the state had a higher proportion of lower-paid and public sector workers. Mr Eslake said the fastest wage growth nationally had been in the health care and the social assistance sector, where the Wage Price Index was up 6.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter. He said this was largely due to big increases in wages awarded by the Fair Work Commission to workers in the aged care sector. \"Other sectors with above-average wage growth have been public administration and safety, up 5 per cent, education and training, up 4.4 per cent, and retail trade, up 4.2 per cent,\" Mr Eslake said. He said there were three reasons why wages overall had risen faster under the current government: And Mr Eslake has said there are three reasons why life at present seems more unaffordable. While wages have risen at a faster rate, so have prices. The Consumer Price Index has risen at an average rate of 4.9 per cent per annum since 2022, with the prices of essential items rising at a rate of 5.3 per cent, compared to discretionary items at 4.4 per cent. Mr Eslake said this means real wages have fallen at an average annual rate of 1 per cent under the current government, compared to 0.1 per cent under previous Coalition governments. Secondly, he said personal income taxes had taken a \"growing bite\" out of incomes, partly due to bracket creep and partly due to the expiry of the Coalition&apos;s low and middle-income tax offset. \"The tax cuts which came into effect at the beginning of July will partly offset that, and the Albanese Government rejigged them so that all taxpayers get something, but it doesn&apos;t completely offset the increase in the tax take over the past decade,\" Mr Eslake said. Thirdly, mortgage holders have been hit hard by 13 increases in interest rates between May 2022 and November 2023. Mr Eslake added real living standards had demonstrably fallen quite a lot in the past three years. \"Real per capita household disposable income has fallen by 9.6 per cent from its peak in the June quarter of 2021, including by 5.8 per cent since the Albanese government came to office,\" he said.",

    "text": "An Apple Watch is a great device for tracking health and fitness goals, and one important aspect of that is how much energy you’re burning. Follow along for how to see your calories burned on your Apple Watch for active and passive metrics, as well as your daily total.\nYour Apple Watch keeps track of your active calories burned, and your Move ring shows that progress compared to your daily goal. But your Apple Watch also tracks your total calories burned, which is your active plus passive calories.\nActive calories are those you burn from movement. Passive calories are the set amount of calories your metabolism burns just being alive, even if you just sat on the couch all day. That’s called your base metabolic rate.\nLet’s take a look at how to calculate your passive calories, along with where to see your overall numbers to get a better picture of your metabolism, assistance with meal planning, and more.\nWhile the Apple Watch tracks and records your calorie metrics, you have to use an iPhone to see the most calorie data.\nIf you’re interested in measuring your real-time metabolic data, check out our full review of Lumen , which works with Apple Health and iPhones.\nHow to see Apple Watch calories burned – active, passive, and total Apple Watch – active calories On your Apple Watch, head to the Activity app . Swipe or scroll down with the Digital Crown. You’ll see your active calories burned under the Move goal . You can also add the Activity complication to a variety of watch faces or use an Activity watch face to see active calories burned at a glance. iPhone – active and passive calories The Fitness app on your iPhone allows you to see more calorie data. Once you open it, tap the Activity rings at the top. Just under the move data, you’ll see your total calories burned for the day in the bottom left of your screen . To see the total calories burned for more days, choose another day from the top of your screen or tap the calendar icon in the top right corner. Subtract your active (“Move” goal) calories from the total to get your passive calories burned (base metabolic rate).

    "text": "William Hendon, who was tased after storming a Cincinnati [baseball](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259826/20240420/faa-probing-baseball-coach-cockpit-during-united-airlines-flight.htm) field, appeared in court Wednesday where the judge asked if he [landed that backflip](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261397/20240612/police-stun-gun-fan-who-ran-field-cincinnati-reds-game-william-hendon.htm), to which he proudly responded, 'I sure did.' Hendon was at the Cincinnati Reds vs Cleveland Guardians [game](https://www.hngn.com/articles/258797/20240325/shohei-ohtani-los-angeles-dodgers-ippei-mizuhara.htm) at Great American Ball Park on Tuesday night when he ran toward a Guardians outfielder before heading toward the infield. After several dozen feet, he came to a halt and successfully landed a backflip before a police officer caught up to him and tasered Hendon, putting a swift end to his show. The nineteen-year-old has been charged with two misdemeanor counts: criminal trespass and obstructing official business. He pleaded not guilty. The legend of Hendon (The GABP Backflipper) continues to grow.. This kids unbelievable 😂 [pic.twitter.com/UEi8ky5G2W]— Bengalorian (@thebengalorian) [June 13, 2024]",
