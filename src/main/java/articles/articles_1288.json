    "title": "Senado de México avala que Sheinbaum desacate orden de una jueza sobre la reforma judicial - RT",
    "text": "El Senado de México consideró, con 81 votos a favor y 36 en contra, que la presidenta del país, Claudia Sheinbaum, no puede eliminar la reforma judicial del Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF), como lo ordenó la jueza Nancy Juárez Salas. De esta manera, la mayoría de los senadores, con el impulso del oficialista Morena, aprobaron el acuerdo que da respuesta a la consulta de la Consejería Jurídica de la Presidencia de la República respecto de \"si es procedente eliminar\" la publicación. \"La presidenta de la República carece de atribuciones para llevar a cabo la eliminación de dicha publicación oficial\", leyó el presidente de la Cámara de Senadores, Gerardo Fernández Noroña. ▶️ Respuesta del presidente de la Mesa Directiva, — Senado de México (@senadomexicano)[@fernandeznorona], a la consulta de la titular de Consejería Jurídica de la Presidencia respecto a la procedencia de la eliminación de la reforma al Poder Judicial del[@DOF_SEGOB].[pic.twitter.com/gi8f05NWPe][October 24, 2024] Fernández Noroña también dijo durante la sesión que es imposible acatar lo ordenado por la jueza, pues la publicación de los cambios constitucionales se trata de un hecho \"irrevocablemente consumado\", reseñó El Financiero . La oposición, que con 36 votos no apoyó la respuesta a la consulta de la Presidencia, acusó que se cae en \"desacato\", refiere Político . La consulta fue elevada al Senado luego de que el pasado 17 de octubre, Juárez, titular del Juzgado Décimo Noveno de Distrito en el estado de Veracruz, con residencia en la Ciudad de Coatzacoalcos, emitiera un acuerdo en donde solicita a la presidenta de la República que proceda a eliminar la publicación. Previamente, a finales de septiembre, Juárez también ordenó al entonces presidente del país, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, eliminar la publicación de la reforma judicial en el DOF, algo que tampoco ocurrió. Ese mismo mes, López Obrador promulgó la polémica reforma judicial, en medio de críticas de especialistas y protestas de trabajadores judiciales, tras debates exprés en las dos cámaras del Congreso de la Unión y la ratificación en la mayoría de las legislaturas estadales.",

    "text": "Reuters Videos Spinning plastic bottles into brooms in Cambodia Read full article Reuters Videos Updated February 16, 2024 at 9:08 a.m. STORY: This small warehouse in Cambodia is transforming trash into cleaning tools.\n(Locator: Phnom Penh, Cambodia)\nWorkers there are spinning tons of plastic bottles into bristles for brooms.\nSince March 2023, they have upcycled around 40 tons of discarded plastic bottles.\nThe plastic strips spun from the empty bottles are bundled on a machine,\nsoaked in hot water to soften them, sliced into strips, and sewn onto bamboo sticks with metal wires.\nRunning this small operation is 41-year-old Cambodian entrepreneur Has Kea.\nHe has made it his mission to reduce plastic pollution in his community.\n(Has Kea, Cambodian entrepreneur)\n“So far, we have gone through about 40 tons of plastic bottles. So, it’s quite a large amount of recycling that has gone into the broomsticks, which are very durable and can be used for a long time. The buyers are excited, and we as the manufacturer are also happy and its beneficial to the society, who are supporting us too. It also helps reduce pollution in the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn, could earn them a better living.”\nIn 2010, Kea briefly worked as a conventional broomstick seller\nand recognized the high demand for quality brooms,\nwhich are mainly imported from Thailand and Vietnam.\nKea's big idea came when he realized raw materials are cheaper at home, both the bamboo and the bottles.\n“Plastic bottles are more expensive overseas and they were up-cycling them. I learned that the bottles here are cheaper, together with the cost of other raw material (bamboo sticks) and the cost of labor, so I decided to make them by just designing the shape of a nice-looking broomstick.”\nAccording to Cambodia's environment ministry, up to a fifth of the waste in capital Phnom Penh is plastic.\nSingle-use plastics like bags, straws and bottles are the main culprits clogging up landfills and waterways.\n(Keat Rangsey, Chairman, Phnom Penh Environmental Administration)\nStory continues \"There are about 35,000 to 38,000 tons of trash generated per day (in Phnom Penh). This is a huge amount of garbage consumption from about 3 million people in the city, which means one person produces about 2.6 pounds (of trash, per day).\"\nKea's team churns out around 500 plastic broomsticks every day.\nWith what seems like an endless supply of plastic, he says he doesn't see business drying up soon.\nHe also says he's open to competition in the hopes of encouraging others\nto sweep away more of Cambodia's surging pollution.\nTRENDING 1.

Buffalo secured an impressive win over the Denver Broncos. Ahead of Sunday’s gigantic matchup, both quarterbacks have avoided any MVP discussion, choosing to focus on the team.\nLamar Jackson & Josh Allen are certainly doing their best to take the attention away from themselves and the MVP showdown this Sunday #BillsMafia #RavensFlock pic.twitter.com/wnFLvvuWHc\n— Matthew Bové (@Matt_Bove) January 15, 2025\n“We’re just trying to win.”\nLamar on not buying into hype around the game: pic.twitter.com/P2ZeImrx64\n— Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) January 15, 2025\nLast week, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was 16-21 passing for 175 yards, two touchdowns, and a 132.0 rating. Jackson rushed 15 times for 81 yards, while Derrick Henry carried the night, logging 186 yards on 26 rushing attempts and two touchdowns.\nBaltimore’s defense held Pittsburgh to 280 yards of offense, with just 29 yards rushing on the ground. Najee Harris finished with six carries for 17 yards, and Jaylen Warren had two for six yards on the night. The Steelers had the football for just 20:27.\nFor Buffalo, quarterback Josh Allen was 20-26 passing for 272 yards (10.5 avg), two touchdowns, and a 135.4 passer rating. As a runner, Allen had eight carries for 46 yards (5.8 avg,) while James Cook had 23 carries for 120 yards rushing (5.2 avg) and one touchdown.\nThis matchup will feature the two leading MVP candidates in a game that should be a must-see on the NFL on CBS.\nThis week, it should also create tons of content for ESPN, NBC, NFL Network, and other platforms.",

    "title": "More lung-cancer cases detected earlier",
    "text": "A lung-cancer screening programme that sees mobile clinics visit local communities in England has detected the disease earlier in more than 5,000 people.\nSpecially adapted lorries have been visiting supermarkets, football grounds and town centres in areas with the highest rates of the disease, as part of the biggest initiative of its kind in NHS history.\nSince the programme's launch, in 2019, 5,037 lung cancers have been detected, with 76% of those at the earliest stages of the disease.\nPeople are nearly 20 times more likely to survive for five years if their cancer is detected early, experts say.\nPhil Bennett's stage-one lung cancer was detected after he was seen at a mobile screening clinic in Manchester Phil Bennett, from Droylsden, Manchester, counts himself lucky.\nAt first, he ignored a letter inviting him to be screened at one of the mobile clinics.\nHe had no symptoms and was too busy with work as a self-employed decorator.\nBut when he did take up the offer, it was discovered he had stage-one lung cancer.\nAnd its early detection made a huge difference to his chances of beating the disease.\n'Very unlucky' “Just go and have it done for peace of mind - or if you need treatment, it’ll be sorted straight away,\" Mr Bennett says.\n\"Don’t ignore it. I was very lucky. If you get the invite, you must go along and have it checked. It’s worth it in the end. It could save your life.”\nNoticeable symptoms The programme focuses on 55-74-year-old current and past smokers, who are offered a health check and, if needed, a scan.\nBut experts stress NHS staff are there to offer help and advice - not lecture people about smoking.\nLung cancer does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until it has spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body.\nAnd it is the third commonest type of cancer in the UK - leading to about 35,000 deaths each year.\nSymptoms include:\na long-standing, worsening cough coughing up blood persistent breathlessness continuing tiredness or lack of energy unexplained loss of weight or appetite And anyone with any of these symptoms, should visit their GP straight away.\nDr Haval Balata is a consultant respiratory physician at Withenshaw Hospital Anyone who misses their initial appointment at a mobile clinic, still has plenty of opportunities to be seen at one, Dr Haval Balata, a consultant respiratory physician at Wythenshawe Hospital, says.\n\"Life’s busy for everybody - but we do our best to make it convenient and give people ample opportunity,\" he says.\n\"So the trucks are typically here for 12 hours a day. We’re here on weekends. And whenever we go to a location, we’re there for a good period of time - it’s not like two days.\n\"So if you can't make the original appointment, just let us know - ring us and we'll reschedule.”\nRoy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation chief executive Paula Chadwick said: \"It is fantastic to see that more lives continue to be saved through the targeted lung health checks - and we urge everyone who is invited to take up the opportunity.”\nThe mobile lung-cancer screening programme should be fully rolled out across the country by 2030.\nCancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell, said: “Expanding the programme across England will help to catch more cancers - and we hope to see targeted lung screening implemented across the UK so people can benefit from potentially life-saving checks.\"",
