    "text": "Le plan d’aide aux entreprises québécoises annoncé mardi par François Legault s’attire déjà des critiques de la part du milieu des affaires.\nUn dirigeant à la tête de trois PME estime que l’industrie forestière est négligée.\nPour les PME avec un chiffre d’affaires de 3 millions de dollars, Québec prévoit des prêts pouvant aller jusqu’à 50 millions de dollars pour un an, remboursables dans un maximum de 7 ans. Des prêts et des subventions sont également prévus pour les PME qui projettent des investissements de 10 millions $ et plus dans la productivité.\nÉric Rousseau, qui dirige la Coopérative forestière Ferland-et-Boilleau, le Groupe Lignarez et la Scierie Lac-Saint-Jean, invite le gouvernement à tenir compte des PME de plus petite taille, dont les investissements en productivité sont souvent limités à un million, un million et demi de dollars.\nL’association des fonderies canadiennes voit le programme d’un bon œil, même si des questions demeurent sans réponse.\nL’économiste à la retraite Gilles Bergeron croit que la guerre commerciale incitera des entreprises à se regrouper pour assurer leur survie.\nAu début de 2025, monsieur Bergeron évaluait les pertes d’emplois à un nombre allant de 5000 et 8000 pour le Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, si la crise perdure.",

    "text": "Peter Rosenberg says he doesn’t believe Kanye West’s Instagram apology to the Jewish community is for real.\nYe apologized over the Christmas holiday for his anti-semitic rants but Rosenberg thinks Ye was forced to apologize before clearing a sample on his album.\nTMZ published an article claiming Ye’s apology was possibly written by AI. Rosenberg seems to think so too.\n“I thought, ‘I wonder what the sample is that Kanye needs to try to clear before Friday’. We all know Kanye notoriously is late with handling album stuff. I just wonder whether there was something getting held up. And someone said, ‘Hey, this sample does not get cleared if he does not issue an apology.’ Like you guys said, he just goes on chat GPT and boom we get a quote apology,” said the Hot97 host.\nHe continued, “No part of me believes this apology. I totally agree by the way that the Hebrew part was like so, either intentionally or unintentionally, offensive. As if, like, American Jews can just read Hebrew without vowels. Like, bro, it’s just another offensive thing here.”\nYe is getting ready to drop his new album Vultures.\nTags ·\nkanye west· Peter Rosenberg",

    "text": "METEO Maltempo addio. Dopo i primi 10 giorni di piogge intense e vento, grazie alla rimonta dell'alta pressione, tornano il sole e le temperature miti su tutta l'Italia. A confermare l'arrivo dell'ottobrata Antonio Sanò, fondatore de iLMeteo.it. \"Nelle prossime ore - afferma - avremo ancora qualche residuo addensamento specie sul Triveneto orientale, in Toscana e sul Basso Tirreno, accompagnato da locali piovaschi. Per il resto il tempo sarà in deciso miglioramento ovunque\". Le temperature scenderanno leggermente a causa di venti più freschi dai quadranti settentrionali, specie al meridione ed in Sardegna, ma in complesso il clima sarà mite. Nel weekend sono previste giornate soleggiate eccetto sul nordovest, dove permangono correnti più umide, e in montagna, con addensamenti che comunque non causeranno precipitazioni. Lungo le coste le massime toccheranno 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27°C in Puglia e Calabria, 25-26°C in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24°C, Firenze a 22°C e Milano sui 20. Nel dettaglio: - Venerdì 11. Al nord: piovaschi sui monti emiliani, sole altrove. Al centro: piovaschi sulla Toscana interna. Al sud: nubi residue con locali piovaschi sulle tirreniche. - Sabato 12. Al nord: nuvoloso. Al centro: soleggiato. Al sud: soleggiato. - Domenica 13. Al nord: sole prevalente. Al centro: soleggiato.

    "title": "Heavy snow, frigid temps brings out the best in McHenry County people; food, hotel rooms, warm spaces",
    "text": "Friday’s snow and cold triggered school closings, power outages and some falls, but it also stirred up some good will. “We are seeing some falls entering the hospital related to the snow and ice. We haven’t had patients with exertion issues related to shoveling yet,” Hillary Crumlett, RN, chief nurse executive at Northwestern Medicine [ Huntley ](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/huntley/)Hospital said early Friday. The hospital was not sheltering patients on Friday but, Crumlett said, the hospital “would always assure a safe discharge and assure that patients would be going home to a place where there is heat, electricity, etc.” “If we cannot identify a safe place due to the weather, then we would keep the patient in the hospital,” Crumlett said. “We do offer to host employees staying if they feel unsafe driving home.” They want to be safe when the weather gets cold and they will be.”— Gina Zinck, Pioneer Center for Human Services as the coordinated entry lead matching homeless people to housing in McHenry County In [Woodstock](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/woodstock/), Rob Mutert, owner of Warp Corps who provides help to homeless people, and Andrew Turner, supervisor of street outreach for Warp Corps, headed over to McDonald’s early Friday and bought food for nine people who are currently homeless. Mutert and Turner then went with the group to a “tent city,” in Woodstock, where people experiencing homelessness live. They helped gather up their belongings and drove them to free hotel rooms made available on Friday through the McHenry County Pioneer Center for Human Services and PADS Emergency Homeless Shelter. “I got to say the people today were so stoked for the food and coffee and a ride to the hotel,” Mutert said. “Laughing all the way, joking and thankful.” Mutert encourages anyone in need of cold-weather clothing and supplies to call him at 815-985-6256. Gina Zinck, coordinated entry lead for the center, said she has been “working like crazy” answering calls from those who need shelter. Hotel rooms are made available for homeless people through the center’s extreme cold weather program. Hotels throughout the county participate in providing homeless people rooms for free when the temperatures dip below 15 degrees. Zinck said she began her day at 6 a.m. on Friday and likely will work up until 10 p.m. for the next several days finding shelter for people to keep them safe from the frigid temps. She began getting calls for those who need rooms on Thursday and is currently working with 20 people. She expects more to call, Zinck said. “It’s scary when you think about sub-zero temps and not having a place,” Zinck said. “That is all anybody is talking about [when they call]. They want to be safe when the weather gets cold and they will be.” People seeking shelter are encouraged to call Zinck at 815-759-7133. Tom Wilson, retired owner of MBI in Woodstock, which also operates MBI Cares philanthropy, leases the Woodstock train station, 90 Church St., for events such as feeding people on Thanksgiving and hosting meetings. Wilson works with others throughout the community, including Mutert, helping wherever there is a need. He currently is collecting clothing and other items at his facility at 227 West Judd St. for anyone in need, as well as migrants who might arrive again in the county. Early Friday, he had his son unlock the doors at the train depot and said he will be keeping them open around the clock over the next few days so people can go in and keep warm. Friday afternoon, he was not sure how many people were in the station, but said “however many there may be, they are warm and out of the cold, which is all that matters.” He said “from now until further notice” he will keep the station open 24/7 “to ensure that anyone who needs protection from the elements receives it.” The snow and cold can create some dangerous conditions, and area doctors offered some advice. Dr. Jacob Ginglen of Cary, who works as an emergency medicine doctor at Mercy Health in Crystal Lake, cautioned people to know that hypothermia and frostbite can set in quickly. With the deep freeze ahead, people should: - Not be outside longer than 10 or 15 minutes. - Wear lots of layers of clothing and keep them dry. - Cover every inch of skin, paying special detail to ears, nose, fingers and toes. - Frostbite can occur quickly. Sometimes it can help to quickly warm the skin, but go to the hospital if the skin turns pale, tingly, numb, hard or black. Ginglen and Victoria Weston, medical director for the Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care Centers in Huntley, [ McHenry,](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/mchenry/) and [Crystal Lake](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/crystal-lake/), cautioned folks on shoveling snow. “It’s important to recognize that shoveling snow is a very physically strenuous exercise,” Weston said. “This is also the case even if you are using a snow blower.” Ginglen said this type of snow is very heavy and it is better to use the shovel to move the snow off to the side rather than scooping it up and lifting it. And, take lots of breaks. They say during this type of snowfall, the number of heart attacks is historically high. The doctors also recommended: - Those with exercise limitations, including cardiac issues, should check with their doctor, have a cellphone available, and make sure someone is at home should they need to get help. - If there is any chest, neck, jaw, shoulder or back pain or fainting, stop right away and call 911. - Those with any personal or family history of heart issues should first get cleared by their doctor or avoid shoveling snow until being evaluated and cleared to do so by a medical professional. Weston also said to be aware of black ice and wear good gripping footwear to prevent falls. If traveling, be sure to have a full tank of gas. Kelly Monestero, director of emergency services at Northwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital, said that with the frigid temps and icy roads, people should dress warm and keep items in the car to keep them warm. Other tips: - Salt walkways generously. - If someone falls, fall safe. People should not put their hands out in front of them; they should curl arms in and try to fall on their rear, Ginglen said. - Plan for extra drive time. “If you don’t have to go out, stay at home where it is warm and safe,” Monestero said.",

Muslims set to mark a month of spirituality, reflection](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/08/ramadan-2024-when-what/72866014007/) Began with just a few neighbors At its start, the event was just a handful of neighbors breaking their fast together. Hamada Hassan told CBS News that no one had enough space in their home to host everyone, so they set up tables outside. It only continued to grow from there. Gulf News reported organizers begin preparing for the event around two months in advance every year. Preparations include everything from gathering necessary supplies to feed a whole neighborhood, to cleaning and decorating the streets, CBS News reported. Ahmed Ekram, an organizer said this year 10,000 meals were served, Gulf News reported, citing local media. Some in attendance didn't eat, but went to simply enjoy the camaraderie, CBS News reported. Local donations fund the costs of the event, which over the years has seen politicians, celebrities, and diplomats in attendance. “We do not care about the cost, as all the residents of the neighborhood participate in financing the table in order to bring joy and happiness to the people of the region and other neighboring areas,\" Ahmed Khalaf, one of the organizers of the 2023 event told [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2284791/middle-east) at the time.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
