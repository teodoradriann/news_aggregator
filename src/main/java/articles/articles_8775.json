    "text": "BERLIN: Germany has authorized over $100 million in military exports to Israel in the last three months, Foreign Ministry data showed on Thursday, coinciding with the latest legal challenge by human rights groups concerned about the potential use of these weapons in the Gaza war.\nGermany has approved €94,052,394 ($101.61 million) in arms exports to Israel since August 2024, according to a government response to a parliamentary inquiry by left-wing lawmaker Sevim Dagdelen.\nThe new permits followed a significant drop in arms exports to Israel in the first half of the year.\nThe European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights said on Thursday it had filed an appeal at the Frankfurt Administrative Court on behalf of a Gaza resident, seeking to halt further arms exports.\nThe appeal says German weapons are contributing to civilian harm in Gaza. The plaintiff, a Gaza resident who lost his wife and daughter in Israeli airstrikes, says ongoing arms shipments place his life and the lives of others in danger, calling on Germany to stop facilitating these transfers.\nThe action aimed at Germany’s Federal Office of Economics and Export Control, the German government responsible for such approval, focuses on Germany’s approval of military exports that could be used in the conflict, the ECCHR said.\nThe ECCHR says Germany’s exports violate international law, citing the Arms Trade Treaty, which prohibits arms transfers if there is a significant risk they will be used to commit war crimes.",

    "text": "El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s war on gangs is credited with slashing homicide rates and restoring security and dignity to citizens of what was once one of the world’s most dangerous countries. The price, say observers and victims, is paid in arbitrary arrests, inhumane detention, even torture — and fear of a whole new kind.\nUnder a state of emergency that suspended many fundamental rights, Bukele’s regime has rounded up more than 75,000 suspected gangsters — some merely for sporting tattoos.\nAbout 7,000 have since been freed for a lack of evidence, but activists say many innocents — including minors — remain behind bars.\nInnocent people are dying Sandra Hernandez, 36, says her husband Jose Medrano, a day laborer, was taken by police in May 2022. He never returned. Medrano was falsely accused of gang membership, said Hernandez at her rickety, wooden home on a dirt road in El Rosario , some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the capital San Salvador.\nThe last she heard from her husband was thanks to a covert call nearly a year after his arrest to tell her he had been taken to hospital for dialysis.\nShe was later informed he had died, of kidney failure. “But at the funeral home I was told the body had bruises,” said Hernandez. “Innocent people are dying,” she said. Hernandez lives with a son of 17 and a 13-year-old daughter in a shack with no water or electricity.\nThe family depends on remittances sent by a relative in the United States and odd bricklaying jobs her son does. “People don’t know what life is really like,” she said.\nOne lives in Fear Maricela Mendez, 35, was sleeping when police burst into her home in a suburb of the capital in July 2022. She was taken to prison and her children, 11 and seven, sent to stay with their grandmother.\nMendez was accused of being a known local criminal, but insists she is innocent. “The police officer had a quota of five arrests,” she said.\nA month after she arrived at prison, Mendez found out she was pregnant, and lived in fear of a miscarriage for all her five months of incarceration. “We were punished, we were beaten, we were not given water” and made to sleep on the floor, the beautician said of her experience in three different penitentiaries.\nShe gave birth two months after her release. The bigger children are still traumatized, she said. “When they see a patrol car they cry, they are afraid they will take me away again… One lives in fear,” she said of life in Bukele’s El Salvador.\nGood people are Paying Josefina Bonilla takes care of two toddler grandchildren. Their mother, Bonilla’s daughter Stefany Santos, 24, was arrested in June 2022.\n“I have no news of her,” said the 63-year-old tearfully, showing off a photo of her daughter at her home in Soyapango in the San Salvador department. She suspects Santos was falsely denounced by her in-laws, with whom relations are strained.\n“She is innocent. People are taken away and not investigated,” said Bonilla, who is unable to work for having to take care of the little ones and gets by on handouts. “My daughter is asthmatic and has psychological problems. I worry that she’s not getting her medicine,” added Bonilla.\n“Good people are paying for the sins of others,” she said in reference to the now-diminished gangs that had for so long imposed a reign of terror on the country. “Mothers are without their children, and children without their parents.”\nRobbed of a future Irma Garcia, 42, said she had not been able to speak to her son Isaias Galicia, who was arrested aged only 17 in June 2022 and charged with gang association.\n“I haven’t seen him. I don’t know if he’s okay, if he’s alive,” she said, clutching a photo of her son at her home in the north of San Salvador. “My son is not a gang member, he doesn’t have any tattoos, he didn’t hurt anyone,” insisted Garcia, who works as a cleaner and has three other children aged 13 to 21.\nAfter Isaias’s arrest, Garcia said the family was cast out by their community and forced to find a new home. She said she brings food, water and clothing to the prison, but has no idea if her son receives any of it.\n“I live in fear that they will inform me he was killed inside,” said Garcia, lamenting that innocent young people are collateral damage for the gang clampdown, necessary as it is. “They have taken away their dreams, their future.”\nShare Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email",

(Getty / Emily_M_Wilson) It's not even a named storm at the moment, but forecasters are warning residents of Florida and Louisiana to be aware of a developing ocean system. As of Thursday, the system is called merely Invest 97L—invest referring to a weather pattern that the National Hurricane Center is investigating, reports WESH. \"A tropical depression could form this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico or far southwestern Atlantic Ocean, including in the vicinity of Florida,\" said the NHC in a Thursday afternoon advisory, per USA Today. The storm is currently dumping rain on locales including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but it's expected to gain power—perhaps enough to develop into Tropical Storm Debby—as it passes into the Gulf of Mexico. \"The latest models show it going into the eastern Gulf and then exploding there,\" says AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok. \"Residents from Louisiana to Florida's West Coast have to be ready in case it rapidly intensifies.\" (More Florida stories.)

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 23-02-2024 03:21 IST | Created: 23-02-2024 03:21 IST France has expelled a Tunisian Muslim cleric for \"radicalism\" and \"unacceptable remarks\", Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on Twitter. \"The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory, less than 12 hours after his arrest. We will not let people get away with anything,\" Darmanin said in a statement on X. In an earlier statement, Darmanin said he had given instructions to issue a ministerial deportation order against \"this radical 'imam' with unacceptable remarks\". \"Firmness is the rule,\" he added. In a post that went viral on social media and was widely reported in French media, the imam referred to \"the three-coloured flag\" as \"satanic\". Mahjoubi, who preached in the Ettaouba mosque of Bagnols-sur-Ceze, southern France, has denied any wrongdoing. He told French media that his comments had been taken out of context and that he had not meant to disrespect the French flag. The French flag has three colours: blue, white and red. His lawyer told French media he will appeal the expulsion procedure. French media published excerpts of the expulsion order, which stated that Mahjoubi had \"conveyed a literal, backward, intolerant, and violent conception of Islam, likely to encourage behaviors contrary to the values of the Republic, discrimination against women, identity retreat, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization'.\" BFM reported that Mahjoubi was being held in administrative detention in the Paris region. Darmanin did not specify where the imam had been held nor when, how and where to he was expelled. Franceinfo reported that Mahjoubi was on a plane headed to Tunis on Thursday evening. Darmanin said that the French government's new immigration law, voted earlier this year, had allowed for the quick expulsion of the imam. With the far-right RN party leading in polls for European elections in June, President Emmanuel Macron is under pressure to be tough on immigration and identity issues.

    "text": "I am running ubuntu 16.04 (fresh install) with the networking interface configured on dhcp inside virtualbox. This worked perfectly on that box until recently and works still perfect for another box.\nSuddently I am having trouble raising the network interface enp0s17. I have another interface configured with static IP that works OK.\n/etc/network/interfaces looks like this:\nsource /etc/network/interfaces.d/* # The loopback network interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback # The primary network interface auto enp0s8 enp0s17 iface enp0s17 inet dhcp iface enp0s8 inet static address 192.143.56.200 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 192.143.56.0 broadcast 192.143.56.255 dns-nameservers 192.143.56.1\nSyslog shows this:\nJan 29 07:17:36 rex dhclient[1091]: DHCPDISCOVER on enp0s17 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 14 (xid=0xaf741468) Jan 29 07:17:36 rex sh[1079]: DHCPDISCOVER on enp0s17 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 14 (xid=0xaf741468) Jan 29 07:17:50 rex systemd[1]: networking.service: Start operation timed out.

Jan 29 07:17:50 rex systemd[1]: Reached target Network.\nThe config looks OK to me and not different to the point where it used to work.\nWhat I did before is to configure iptables, but have deleted the rule and checked it if it is really deleted. The name of the interface seems to be OK:\nsudo ifconfig -a enp0s8 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:00:27:4f:d8:fb inet addr:192.143.56.200 Bcast:192.143.56.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe4f:d8fb/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:4098 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:3693 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:303862 (303.8 KB) TX bytes:373908 (373.9 KB) enp0s17 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:00:27:1a:5e:6c inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe1a:5e6c/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:3 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:59 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:276 (276.0 B) TX bytes:18090 (18.0 KB)\nWhat could be the reason for this?",
