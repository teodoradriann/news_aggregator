    "title": "Defiant Verstappen to stick to 'vocal' style after Hungarian Grand Prix fall-out",
    "text": "Max Verstappen (C) made his Formula One debut in 2015 / © AFP\nMax Verstappen declined to apologise for his language and stood his ground on Thursday when questioned about his aggressive behaviour at last weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix.\nIn defiant mood as he talked to reporters ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, he explained it was his style to be \"vocal\" and sometimes \"harsh\" but said it was how he worked with the Red Bull team.\nVerstappen collided with Lewis Hamilton in the closing stages of last Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix before finishing a frustrated fifth in a race during he spent much time abusing his team and his race engineer with a stream of expletives.\nHe had been up until three am the morning of the Grand Prix taking part in computerised sim racing.\n\"We talked about it,\" he said.\n\"You don’t need to worry – there are no other races coming up! No, it's not that I have a ban.\n\"I don't need to tell them what to do in their private time over the weekend and it's the same for me.\n\"It's not something new and, for me, it's something very important in my life. There are no other sim races coming up anyway, so no-one has to worry about that.\n\"But it's always when you don’t win the race that you blame it on things like staying up late or being one kilo overweight or what you ate for dinner last night.\n\"There's always things to make up that you can argue about when you don’t win a race, but, for example, in Imola I did win the race – both of them. For me, this is not something new. I’ve been doing this since 2015,\" he added.\nOn his outbursts last weekend, he said he praised the team \"many times\" and was frustrated.\n“I want to do the best I can and the team wants to do the best it can… It's harsh, but it’s how we operate. It’s not personal. We win and we lose together and not everyone agrees with everything.\n\"I’m a three-time world champion and I know what I can do and what I can’t do and for me it’s like any other day.\n\"We are not the quickest at the moment and we have to figure out what to do with the car,\" he added.\nSeven-time champion Hamilton suggested Verstappen had failed to act \"like a world champion\" when required at the Hungaroring.\n\"You have to be a team leader, a team member. Maybe not so much a leader, but always to remember you are team-mate to a lot of people,\" Hamilton told reporters.\n\"You have to act like a world champion.\n\"Not like it was last weekend,\" the Briton added.",

    "text": "Dying with Dignity Canada (DWDC) would like to see MAiD available to minors – children aged 12 years and up. As The Publica [reports](https://www.thepublica.com/canada-medical-assistance-in-dying-advocacy-group-calls-on-government-to-expand-eligibility-to-mature-minors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=canada-medical-assistance-in-dying-advocacy-group-calls-on-government-to-expand-eligibility-to-mature-minors), DWDC wants to lower the age limitations for MAiD in tune with its stated objective of “improving the quality of dying” and is asking the Trudeau government to “amend the existing age requirement of 18 years of age to extend to persons at least 12 years of age and capable of making decisions with respect to their health.” The group has been seeking additional changes to the MAiD program since [Bill C-7](https://www.dyingwithdignity.ca/education-resources/bill_c7_six_months_later_recording_september2021/)expanded MAiD to people who could not expect a “reasonably foreseeable,” death. A Parliamentary Review of the bill anticipated that Canada’s euthanasia program could someday include the “eligibility for MAID of mature minors.” DWDC has latched on to this assurance in its desire to expand MAiD to so-called “mature minors” with a crippling or incurable medical condition. “DWDC acknowledges that Canadian society will likely expect a minimum age for mature minors in the legislation, even though the emphasis at common law is on capacity and maturity and not chronological age,” reads the post. “For this reason, DWDC asks that Parliament amend the existing age requirement of 18 years of age to extend it to persons at least 12 years of age and capable of making decisions with respect to their health. As with adults, there should be a presumption of capacity for these minors.” As The Publica notes, creating a category of something called “mature minors” could well redefine age of consent laws in Canada in a myriad of areas, including sexual activity. In March, Canada could [ extend](https://thepostmillennial.com/canadian-psychologists-debate-allowing-assisted-suicide-for-mentally-ill-patients-as-deadline-approaches) the “eligibility” of its euthanasia program to the mentally ill, a category that [could also include](https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/david-krayden-its-time-to-stop-canadas-euthanasia-program-dead-in-its-tracks-5531529) drug addicts and alcoholics. Critics say that is not just euthanasia but eugenics. The federal government postponed the expansion in 2023, after receiving considerable push-back from some prominent psychiatrists [who questioned](https://globalnews.ca/news/10243442/maid-expansion-canada-readiness-deadline/) the prudence of the change in an open letter. Among the authors of this correspondence was the chief of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre’s psychiatry department and University of Toronto professor Sonu Gaind, who wrote, “There remain no meaningful safeguards to prevent vulnerable and marginalized individuals, who could get better, from getting MAiD during periods of despair and suicidality fueled by mental illness,” wrote Gaind in a briefing submitted to the committee last November. “I can assure you that Canada simply is not ready to implement MAiD for mental illness,” he added. Statistics Canada [has been disguising](https://thepostmillennial.com/canada-has-recorded-cause-of-death-from-euthanasia-as-ailment-patient-suffered-prior-to-suicide-since-program-began) the number of deaths attributable to MAiD since the program began in 2016. Information about MAiD deaths can still be found on the [Health Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/health-system-services/annual-report-medical-assistance-dying-2022.html), which reports that in 2022 “there were 13,241 MAID provisions reported in Canada, accounting for 4.1% of all deaths in Canada.” Health Canada even provides the total figure of MAiD fatalities: “When all data sources are considered, the total number of medically assisted deaths reported in Canada since the introduction of federal MAID legislation in 2016 is 44,958.” Given the annual increase in the use of the MAiD program, when the numbers for 2023 are considered, the total number of deaths could now total 60,000. Comments 2024-01-25T15:38-0700 | Comment by: Joann I was an initial supporter of MAID. I had watched my 94 year old mother with dementia and a healthy body take 3 days to die from pneumonia. At times she would look around with eyes full of terror. We had to keep swabbing her mouth with water because it was so dry. It was a hard death for her and for my sister and I who stayed by her bedside most of the time. Fortunately we were both with her when she drew her last breath. She would have wanted euthanasia had it been an option at the time. She had cared for and watched her mother die of cancer when she was 15 years old. She would not have wanted my sister and I to repeat that experience. I have had work experience with clients who were at times suicidal. What they needed was not help with suicide, but help to survive a very dark period in their lives. Powered by StructureCMS™ Comments Join and support independent free thinkers!
