    "text": "Con las últimas lluvias y atendiendo a la temporada de mucho calor se podría tener un repunte de casos de dengue. Esta enfermedad se volvió endémica y desde el Ministerio de Salud recuerdan que solo basta con limpiar los patios de las casas, además, de mantener libre de basuras los espacios públicos para reducir la infestación larvaria.\nSegún la doctora Andrea Ojeda, directora general de Vigilancia de la Salud, lo más importante en esta temporada es mantener las medidas preventivas para evitar el aumento de la enfermedad. En las últimas semanas se reportaron varios días con lluvias y la acumulación de agua son lugares propicios para los criaderos del mosquito Aedes Aegypti, transmisor el dengue.\n“En el país tenemos periodos epidémicos o de brotes, que empiezan generalmente en esta época. Si bien, este año podemos hablar de que hay un retraso en el inicio, tenemos unos brotes concentrados en el Chaco y en el norte del país”, expresó Ojeda, en entrevista con Paraguay TV.\n[Lea también: Comerciantes de Saltos del Guairá aguardan un 30 % de aumento en ventas](https://www.lanacion.com.py/negocios/2024/12/19/comerciantes-de-saltos-del-guaira-aguardan-un-30-de-aumento-en-ventas/)\nImportación de casos\nResaltó que en esta temporada los compatriotas viajan mucho a Brasil y al Caribe, donde también se tiene una importante cantidad de casos, lo que puede representar un problema para el país. Se podría estar ante la importación de cepas que aún no se reportaron en Paraguay, por lo que están en alerta máxima. Además, de que existe una nueva amenaza denominada “oropouche” enfermedad que también es trasmitida por este mosquito.\n“Antes por lo menos teníamos estaciones un poco más marcadas. Ahora, con el cambio climático, tenemos calor extremo una semana, la semana siguiente llueve y ahí es donde tenemos que estar atentos en casa, eliminar todo lo que acumule agua y puede ser criadero del mosquito”, apuntó.\nSalir a limpiar los patios\nAlentó a la ciudadanía a que salga a sus patios tras cada lluvia y realizar mingas por lo menos un par de días a la semana, para evitar la propagación de la enfermedad. Se deben eliminar recipientes que acumulen agua, revisar los bebederos de los animales y plantas. Además, usar repelentes y consultar al médico ante cualquier síntoma.\n“El dengue es un enemigo persistente. Como ciudadanos, tenemos una cuota de responsabilidad que no podemos ignorar. Las acciones individuales son esenciales, pero también es necesario un trabajo coordinado entre los gobiernos locales, las municipalidades y las instituciones nacionales”, puntualizó.\nOropouche\nEl Oropouche es una enfermedad viral transmitida por la picadura de mosquitos y los síntomas incluyen fiebre repentina, dolor de cabeza intenso, debilidad extrema, dolores articulares y musculares. En algunos casos, pueden aparecer fotofobia, mareos, náuseas o vómitos persistentes y lumbalgia.\n[Lea más: DNIT cierra un exitoso año con nuevos desafíos para el 2025](https://www.lanacion.com.py/negocios/2024/12/19/dnit-cierra-un-exitoso-ano-con-nuevos-desafios-para-el-2025/)",

    "title": "Endangered Asiatic lion cubs born at Fota Wildlife Park",
    "text": "Three endangered Asiatic lion cubs have been born at Fota Wildlife Park in Co Cork to a lioness who was part of the first lion cub litter born there almost seven years ago.\nThe cubs - all male - are the first to be born at Fota since 2019.\nThe Asiatic lion is classified as endangered by the International Union of Conservation of Nature and, in the wild, inhabits only one remaining site in the world, at the Gir Forest in India.\nThe current population in the Gir Forest is estimated to be between 500 and 600, meaning wildlife parks and zoos like Fota play a crucial role in safeguarding the species from extinction in the wild.\nThe three male cubs were born a month ago today to lioness Arya and her mate, Yali.\nSince then, they have been thriving. Their eyes are now open, they are plump and healthy, they weigh around 4.5 kilos each, they have passed all veterinary checks and they have just been micro-chipped.\nYali, described as \"a very modern father\", was present at the birth of the three cubs. That is a first for Fota too.\nThe three cubs were born a month ago today to lioness Arya and her mate, Yali Arya has been feeding the cubs herself since they were born.\n\"We are overjoyed with the birth of Arya's cubs,\" said lead ranger Julien Fonteneau. \"Arya and Yali's cubs are not just vital to our breeding programme, but also to the global efforts in preserving the Asiatic lion population.\"\nThe cubs will be ready to breed themselves when they are aged two years or slightly older, and Julien said a decision will be taken at that stage to either keep them at Fota or to send them elsewhere for breeding.\nAt the moment though, all efforts are concentrated on making sure they are being nurtured properly.\n\"Although inexperienced, Arya is excelling as a new mother and is very protective,\" Julien said.\n\"We have been monitoring the cubs daily and they all appear to be well fed and active. She has been caring for the cubs outdoors under the foliage and out of sight.\n\"Whenever it rains, she carries them to the heated lion shelter, which our visitors know well. While they are still very young and sleeping a lot, it is possible to catch a glimpse of them at the lion shelter at Fota.\"\nSix-year old Arya was born in Fota in August 2017, part of the first litter of lion cubs to be born at the park.\nShe spent a number of years in Helsinki Zoo in Finland, but returned to Fota earlier this year after she was ousted by the lionesses there.\nThe latest litter brings to seven the number of Asiatic lions at Fota, which describes the cubs' arrival as a significant milestone in its on-going conservation efforts.\nArya has been keeping her cubs hidden in the bushes Aileen Tennant who recently took up her position as Director of Fota Wildlife Park said: \"We are incredibly proud.\n\"As a new director here at Fota Wildlife Park, it's such a special week to come in, to meet these gorgeous cubs and to see the animals show their natural behaviours. They're great parents, Arya and Yali, and I look forward to seeing the cubs growing over the summer.\n\"I invite everyone to come in and see them because, as we know, with youngsters they're full of playfulness and they're great animals to watch as they develop and grow older.\"\nRanger Jess Hodnett has been looking after the three cubs since they were born. She describes her work as a privilege.\n\"Up to now we haven't been too hands on with them - this is our first time getting hands on with the cubs, just giving them a full health check and a look over.\n\"Mom has been doing a really good job. She kind of does all the hard work herself. We've been monitoring them from a distance up to this point.\n\"She's been keeping them in the bushes, keeping them hidden. She moves them into the warm heated cave behind me as the weather changes, and she'll move them back out again if she wants.\nThe cubs have yet to be named and people are invited to make suggestions \"They're just starting to get more mobile now so, from now on, we'll start looking at more contact and building relationships with them.\n\"It's an absolute privilege to work with them. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes by the whole team, just to keep the pride going and work with the pride and with the animals.\"\nThe three cubs can now be seen from the viewing area at the lion enclosure at the park.\nThey have not been named yet, and Fota is inviting the public to make suggestions.\nSuggestions can be made via the the park website, www.fotawildlife.ie",

Some people may not even know they have cardiovascular disease, making them even more vulnerable to cognitive decline over the course of their lives.\nHeart disease and dementia, growing concern Research published by the American Heart Association (AHA) reveal a significant link between heart disease and cognitive impairment, with conditions such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease being associated with a much higher risk of developing dementia.\nKey heart conditions associated with cognitive decline Three heart conditions in particular have been identified as having a significant impact on dementia risk: heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary heart disease. These conditions contribute to the loss of cognitive function, which is a precursor to dementia. Cognitive decline is a devastating condition that affects memory and independence, often leading to more serious neurological disorders.\nSee also: Climbing the stairs reduces high blood pressure. 5 minutes a day has a major effect\nAtrial fibrillation, the silent risk Atrial fibrillation, an irregular and rapid heart rhythm, is the biggest risk for cognitive decline, with people with the condition 39% more likely to develop dementia. Atrial fibrillation disrupts blood flow to the brain, increasing the risk of small strokes and cognitive problems.\nThis condition is particularly dangerous because of its link to risk factors such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity, which also increase the risk of cognitive problems.\nHeart failure, double threat People with heart failure also face an increased risk of cognitive decline, with studies showing that nearly 50 percent of people with the condition experience some form of cognitive decline. Reduced blood flow to the brain and chronic inflammation are key factors in these problems, leading to small strokes or silent brain damage.\nSee also: What happens when you cook tomatoes. Dr. Lygia Alexandrescu: We improve tomato quality. Releases lycopene\nThe link between blood flow and brain health The common thread between heart disease and dementia is the impact on blood flow to the brain. Reduced circulation, whether from heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or coronary heart disease, prevents the brain from working properly. This disruption of blood flow, along with inflammation, plays a central role in the development of cognitive decline.\nHypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for heart disease, further complicate the situation by causing inflammation that damages the blood-brain barrier and reduces blood flow to the brain.\nHeart diseases, impact on the brain – PHOTO: Freepik\nThe role of lifestyle changes in prevention Experts point out that lifestyle interventions such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly and managing stress can help reduce the risks of heart disease and dementia. Early management of heart health is critical to preventing cardiovascular events and protecting brain function.\nAlthough new drugs are being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, prevention remains the most effective approach, and managing heart health early is key to reducing the risk of long-term cognitive decline.\nSee also: Benign senology, a guide to current medical practice. Dr. Ștefan Voiculescu: Diet, choosing a bra, dermatocosmetics, breast care\nThe need for further research Although the link between cardiovascular health and dementia is clear, more research is needed to better understand how treatments for heart disease can improve brain health. Experts are also calling for studies that explore how factors such as gender, race and ethnicity may influence the relationship between heart health and cognitive decline.\nProfessor Fernando Testai, who helped draft the AHA statement, emphasized the importance of preventing cognitive decline by managing heart health.\n“Although new drugs are being developed with the potential to treat Alzheimer’s disease, the medical community is aware that prevention is better than cure,” said Prof. Fernando Testai, according to Daily Mail.\nStay up to date with the latest news. Follow DCMedical and on Google News\nDid this article help you?\nFollow the page of Facebook DCMedical and the page of Instagram DCMedical Dose of Health and access more useful content for your health, disease prevention and treatment, first aid measures and helpful advice from doctors and patients.\nWell, well, well, isn’t this just a cheery little read? Heart disease and its unexpected sidekick, dementia. It’s like finding out your goldfish has been secretly living a double life as a ninja! Who knew your ticker had such a busy social calendar? Let’s dive into this delightful cocktail of cognitive calamity, shall we?\nHeart Disease and Dementia: The Dynamic Duo So, apparently, millions are unknowingly playing a dangerous game with their heart health, and let me tell you, it’s not a fun game of bingo. Recent findings from the American Heart Association have painted a rather grim picture, suggesting that conditions like heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease aren’t just sitting there quietly, twiddling their thumbs. Oh no! They’re upping your chances of developing dementia faster than you can say “where did I put my keys?”\nImagine this scenario: you’re at a party, enjoying the music, suddenly someone whispers that your heart has decided to start plotting against your brain. Sounds dramatic, right? But that’s pretty much the reality for many people dealing with these conditions.\nKey Heart Conditions: The Usual Suspects Let’s meet the culprits, shall we? First up, we have atrial fibrillation – not your run-of-the-mill heart rhythm issue, mind you! It’s a cheeky little deviant that increases the likelihood of dementia by a staggering 39%. I mean, what a party crasher! It disrupts blood flow to the brain, which is equivalent to trying to run a marathon with one shoe on; not exactly a recipe for success!\nNext in line is heart failure , and it’s no slouch either, boasting a near 50% chance of leading its victims into cognitive decline territory. Who needs horror movies when you have heart problems knocking at your door? Reduced blood flow and chronic inflammation are conspiring to turn your brain into a less-than-ideal environment for memory and quick thinking. It’s like hosting a dinner party where all the guests are just really bad influences.\nThe Marriage of Blood Flow and Brain Health The link here is as clear as a glass of water—blood flow. Or the notable lack of it, thanks to our devious heart conditions. Picture your brain trying to work under conditions reminiscent of an old-fashioned traffic jam. Not great, is it? High blood pressure, type 2 diabetes—almost makes you nostalgic for simpler health concerns like a bit of hiccups or a paper cut.\nBut Wait, There’s Hope! Now before you clench that heart-shaped pillow in despair, let’s take a moment to focus on the silver lining. Experts are shouting from rooftops (well, maybe not literally, but you get the point) about lifestyle interventions! Yes, folks, the keys to unlocking heart and brain health are swinging right at your hip. Eat well, exercise regularly, and don’t forget to manage that stress like it’s your ex stalking you at a party. Prevention is the name of the game, plain and simple.\nAlso, let’s not forget that modern medicine is working tirelessly on new drugs, but the age-old adage stands tall: prevention beats cure any day of the week. Just take a moment, breathe, and remember, it’s not all doom and gloom; a few lifestyle tweaks could save you from a plot twist that even the best of screenwriters wouldn’t dare to dream up.\nThe Need for Further Research And while we’re at it, more research! Yes, we need to nail down the nitty-gritty of heart disease and its nemesis, dementia. We need to know how treatments for heart conditions can bolster cognitive health, and whether factors like gender, race, and ethnicity play significant roles in this hazardous relationship. Because clearly, it’s not just your heart that needs looking after; your brain deserves some love too!\nSo, let’s wrap this up with the profound wisdom of Professor Fernando Testai, who reminds us that although new drugs hold promise, the magic really lies in prevention. So go ahead, adjust that diet, hit the gym, and for the love of all that is good—don’t forget to manage that stress! Because in the intricate dance of heart and mind, the only way to avoid the dreaded lead is to learn the steps before someone steps on your toes.\nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I think it’s high time to check my own heart rate, preferably while binging on some leafy greens and avoiding stress like it’s my least favorite relative at a family reunion!\nAbout​ the power of⁢ lifestyle changes in‍ preventing ⁣these dire health ‌outcomes.‍ The key? A healthy diet, regular exercise , and stress management . Who ​knew ⁤that swapping out chips for veggies and taking a daily stroll could become the​ heroes in this tale of heart and brain health?\nMany​ experts⁤ suggest⁢ that‍ being proactive with‍ your heart health is critical.⁣ By adopting healthier habits now,⁢ you can pave the way for a brighter future—hopefully one devoid⁣ of ​dementia’s shadow. Think of ⁤it as prepping for ⁤a big test rather than cramming the night before; the more you invest in your health, the better equipped you’ll ⁤be to handle the challenges ahead.\nThe Power of Prevention Prevention is the name of ​the game, and it’s⁤ not just about dodging⁤ bullets⁢ like heart ⁤disease. It extends to cognitive health as well. The American Heart ‍Association has emphasized this dual⁤ prevention model, showing us that caring for our heart can yield a⁢ bounty of benefits for our brain too.⁤ With new⁣ treatments on the‌ horizon for Alzheimer’s, it’s easy ⁣to get distracted, but as medical professionals like Professor Fernando​ Testai remind us, “Prevention is better ‍than cure.” ‌\nIf we can improve cardiovascular health now, we might just be ‌able to stave off​ cognitive ​decline later. It’s a bit like planting a garden—if you want roses, you ​need⁢ to start tending to those seeds early.\nIn Conclusion So there you have it: a rollercoaster of knowledge connecting heart disease and cognitive decline, with a ‍sprinkle of ⁣humor to cushion the ‍seriousness of ⁢these findings. While the landscape of ⁤health can⁤ seem daunting, remember that taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle can make ​a colossal difference. Whether‌ it’s climbing stairs⁢ for ⁣just five minutes a day⁤ to‍ lower hypertension or​ choosing to move more often, every little bit helps.\nAnd now, dear reader, armed with this information, may you stride forth confidently, with a heart that’s ready to dance and a brain that’s primed to⁣ thrive! 🚀❤️",

    "text": "First Alert: Freezing rain to impact parts of the Tri-States\nQUINCY (WGEM) - As the clock continues ticking this evening, chances of rain will begin to increase across the Tri-States. Though, not just rain, but freezing rain will impact portions of the northern areas of the region. We are under First Alert as Scotland and Clark counties in Missouri, Lee County, Iowa, and Schuyler, Hancock and McDonough counties in Illinois are under a winter weather advisory for freezing rain accumulations up to two tenths of an inch. This advisory goes into effect at midnight and lasts through 9am Saturday morning. This will make travel difficult heading North, so take precautions as needed.\nThe central and southern portions of the Tri-States will mostly see rain, and it will last though the night into Saturday afternoon. Up to an inch and a half of rain is possible through tomorrow afternoon, before we clear out for Saturday night. Temperatures will not drop off much into the night time, and slowly warm into Saturday morning. A warm front will slowly track North into the Tri-States by Saturday evening, which will help us climb into the mid-40′s. Then, another warm front will move through on Sunday afternoon, pushing our temperatures into the 50′s overnight into early Monday morning. The chance of showers also return to the Tri-States Sunday night into Monday morning, as a cold front will push through the region giving us a slight chance for embedded thunderstorms. This cold front will drop our overnight low temperatures back into the upper-20′s to around 30°.\nThrough the remainder of the week, temperatures will continue to fall, as highs will be back into the 40′s for Tuesday, with lows around 30° again. Then, by Wednesday we are back into the 30′s during the day with lows into the upper-teens and low-20′s which will remain in play the rest of the week.\nCopyright 2024 WGEM. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith has made a new argument to impose a gag order on former President Donald\nTrump in his classified documents case by displaying death threats from the former president’s most ardent supporters. According to Law & Crime, Smith attempted to justify his demand for a gag order by showing some of the most egregious death threats Trump supporters made to judges and prosecutors. Smith is seeking to prevent the ex-president from lying about \"FBI agents intending to murder him and his family\" during the DOJ's 2022 search for classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.\nIn his filing, Smith showed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon — whom Trump appointed to the federal judiciary in 2020 — threats to Manhattan District Attorney\nAlvin Bragg, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron.\nLaw & Crime described the threats as \"vile,\" and Smith said the gag order was necessary as his rhetoric could \"pose a significant, imminent and foreseeable danger to the law enforcement professionals.\"\nREAD MORE:\n'You should be assassinated': Judge and clerk 'inundated' with 'credible' threats after Trump rant\nSmith's filing included dates of the death threats, and showed that they started pouring in shortly after Trump was indicted in the spring of 2023. Death threats from March of 2023 included ominous warnings like: \"Leave Trump alone... or Bragg will get assassinated,\" and, \"Just shoot Bragg in the head and he stops being a problem.\"\nAnother read, \"If you lay a hand on President Trump or his family, friends, supporters or myself, my family or any patriot — instant death.\"\nIn the filing, Smith went on to show how Trump's rhetoric has motivated his most devoted followers to take matters into their own hands. Following the August 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid, Trump supporter Ricky Shiffer posted to Truth Social — the ex-president's social media platform — that \"the courts are unfair and unconstitutional, all that is left is force.\" He went on to attack the FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was shot dead after a standoff with law enforcement.\nThis latest filing comes on the heels of a separate court filing in Cannon's court, in which Smith warned that if Cannon fails to act quickly to impose a gag order on the ex-president, his words could incite action that may result in the deaths of law enforcement professionals.\n\"[J]ust last week, a supporter of Trump called an FBI agent associated with the Hunter Biden case and claimed that, if Trump wins reelection, FBI agents will be thrown in jail; and if he does not win, the agents will be ‘hunt[ed] down’ and ‘slaughter[ed]’ in their own homes, after which ‘[w]e’re going to slaughter your whole f—ing family,'”\nSmith wrote in a June 21 filing. “No court would tolerate another defendant deliberately creating such immediate risks to the safety of law enforcement, and this Court should not wait for a tragic event before taking action in this case.\"\nREAD MORE:\n'We will kill you all': Trump supporters send 'upsetting' death threats to Manhattan DA\nSmith's request for a gag order came after a Truth Social post in which Trump baselessly claimed that President Joe Biden's DOJ \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" against him. The former president's claim is based on standard language for FBI searches, which states that agents are authorized to use deadly force if they find themselves in a life-or-death situation while executing a search warrant.\nDuring a press conference in May, Attorney General Merrick Garland clarified that there was no plot to assassinate Trump, and that the former president was disingenuously riling up his supporters with \"extremely dangerous\" rhetoric.\n\"The document that is being referred to in the\ninvestigation is a Justice Department standard policy limiting the use of force,\" Garland said at the time. \"As the FBI advises, it is part of the standard operations plan for searches, and in fact it was even used in the consensual search of President Biden.\"\nREAD MORE:\nClick here to read Law & Crime's full report.
