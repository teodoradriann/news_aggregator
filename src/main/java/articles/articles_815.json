    "text": "10-man South Africa ruthlessly expose India's limitations in Centurion Captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid have quite a task ahead of them in the next few days. Who would have thought that literally the brightest day of the week in Centurion would figuratively become the darkest for the No. 1-ranked Test side in the world? India were behind the eight-ball, but only just, when they headed to SuperSport Park for day three of the first Test against South Africa. The middle day is considered the moving day, the events of which generally influence its outcome. This time, the middle day became the final day as India capitulated without a fight, conceding [an innings-and-32-run defeat](https://thefederal.com/cricket/1st-test-south-africa-crush-india-by-innings-and-32-runs-inside-3-days-104708) to what was essentially a 10-man home side. Temba Bavuma, the South African captain, suffered a left hamstring strain on the first afternoon, an injury that has ended his participation in the series. Even without their skipper, South Africa were too strong in familiar, helpful conditions, ruthlessly exposing the limitations of Rohit Sharma’s men in a land where India have been reasonably competitive for the last 17 years and five tours. India dole out freebies India’s quest for a maiden Test series win in South Africa will have to be put on hold for the foreseeable future. They can, at best, salvage a drawn series if they can somehow pull up their socks and roar back next week in Cape Town, where they have yet to win a Test. There were reasons enough to be optimistic of India’s chances heading into the first Test. On their last tour in 2021, India had surged to an impressive win in Centurion; since then, they had held England to a 2-2 draw in the latter’s backyard and come a long way as a Test unit. They possessed all the ingredients that go into the making of a successful team outside the subcontinent – a set of high-class batsmen, and a pace attack helmed by Jasprit Bumrah capable of taking 20 wickets. But it’s one thing having the resources, it’s quite another for all of them to pull in the same direction. Centurion has been cold and bleak and dismal for the last few days, but Thursday dawned bright and beautiful, not a cloud in sight. India’s batsmen generally flourish when the sun beats down on their backs, but not this time. If it was Kagiso Rabada who had done the damage in the first innings, tall left-arm quicks Marco Jansen and debutant Nandre Burger were the heroes of Thursday’s decimation, sharing seven wickets. In the space of 34.1 overs, India were blasted out for 131. More accurately, India doled out freebies, South Africa needing only to be disciplined and consistent because the vaunted batting line-up was in a ‘giving’ mood. Bowlers, barring Bumrah, disappoint KL Rahul’s outstanding century in his maiden outing as a Test wicketkeeper-batsman had helped paper over the cracks in the first innings, when India mustered a respectable 245. In demanding conditions – overhead assistance, lateral movement and spongy bounce – that total was a good one if the bowlers bowled well. But that turned out to be a big ‘if’ because apart from Bumrah, the rest were disappointing. Mohammed Siraj had his moments, true, but the same can’t be said of Shardul Thakur or Prasidh Krishna, the strapping debutant. Whatever pressure had been created with the new ball by Bumrah and Siraj was released by the back-up quicks, who were picked off with nonchalance by Dean Elgar, in his final series before calling time on his international career. Elgar, who will lead the team in the second Test in Bavuma’s absence, is essentially a grafter but he was so taken in by the easy pickings that he breezed to 185, with 28 fours, in an electric display of shot-making. Elgar’s masterpiece was the cornerstone of South Africa’s 408. That’s a huge total anywhere, but given the conditions in Centurion, it might as well have been 600. Rohit was merely stating the obvious when he said [this wasn’t a ‘400 wicket’](https://thefederal.com/cricket/india-vs-sa-bumrah-didnt-get-required-support-this-wasnt-400-plus-pitch-rohit-104715). Once India had fallen so far behind in the first innings, there could only be one outcome. Indian batters' recklessness A deficit of 163 is hard to bounce back from, but there still was plenty to play for India’s batsmen. Personal pride, for one thing. The confidence of runs under their best heading to Newlands. A statement of intent to South Africa that they just wouldn’t roll over and surrender, that their averages aren’t inflated, that they aren’t just hype but full of substance too. Unfortunately, they failed to tick even a single box. Barring Virat Kohli, whose entertaining 76 meant nothing in the final analysis, there was nothing to write home about. While the lack of runs was disappointing, what was disturbing was the manners of dismissal. With total disregard for the game situation and the conditions, strokes were played with abandon, impunity, recklessness even. There is a very thin line between being carefree and careless. If they are honest to themselves, a majority of India’s batsmen will concede that they got themselves out rather than falling to the quality of the bowling that confronted them. What will worry Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid the most is that India didn’t seem to have paid much attention to how South Africa constructed their bowling and batting innings. Where the pacers, Bumrah excepted, were profligate – they either pitched the ball too full in looking for seam or too short in the quest for bounce when merely sticking to the channel outside off at just back of a length would have worked wonders – the batsmen were in an unseemly hurry to tick off boundaries without getting their eye in. Admittedly, this was the sort of track where one could never ever feel settled or ‘in’, as they say, but chancing their arm and trying to hit through the line when the ball was jagging around without using the feet and relying merely on hands was an invitation to disaster. Big task ahead More than the technical shortcomings, India were beaten in the mind, it seemed, when they took the field on the third day. Their body language was lackadaisical and they were content for things to happen rather than trying to make them happen. Not good signs these, not at all. Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid have quite a task ahead of them in the next few days if Cape Town isn’t to be a washout, too. Speaking of, the heavens opened up some 30 minutes after the last Indian wicket had fallen. Perhaps another reminder of the value of patience that might have dragged this game to another day. And maybe even beyond.",

    "text": "CSIRO is seeking to undertake a field trial of genetically modified (GM) canola with increased abiotic stress tolerance. These canola varieties achieve their stress tolerance through the introduction of a gene from yeast. CSIRO proposes to conduct the trials over five years on sites in New South Wales and South Australia, testing the GM canola plants under field conditions with and without irrigation. Trigall Australia is seeking to undertake field trials of a GM wheat variety, known as HB4. HB4 wheat has demonstrated an increased tolerance to environmental stress, in particular drought conditions, and is approved for commercial cultivation in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The wheat varieties achieve tolerance to water stress through the introduction of a gene from the sunflower. This variety is expected to outperform conventional wheat varieties during unfavourable growing conditions, such as drought. Trigall Australia has applied to conduct the trials at 10 sites across NSW, SA, Victoria and Western Australia over five years. Both the GM canola and HB4 wheat express traits likely to improve crop performance in stressful environments. Australian-based field trials would enable researchers to evaluate their effectiveness for Australian farms. Applications to run these field trials have been recently put forward to the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR). The OGTR is seeking comments on the Risk Assessment Risk Management Plans (RARMP) for both applications before a licence decision is made. Golden Rice hits a hurdle A GM biofortified rice developed to address global malnutrition is facing challenges getting into the hands of growers and consumers. This is despite field trials and regulatory approvals from numerous countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. Golden Rice, also known as Malusog Rice, produces large amounts of beta-carotene, a nutrient not normally present in rice. This has been achieved by introducing two genes, one from maize and one from a common soil bacteria. Beta-carotene, responsible for the bright red/orange colour in many fruits and vegetables and the ‘golden’ appearance of the rice, is converted by our bodies to vitamin A. Golden Rice was developed to address vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a major public health problem globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), VAD afflicts 250 million people worldwide, most of which are preschool children (190 million) and pregnant women (19 million). The Philippines and Bangladesh were recommended for the rollout of Golden Rice due to significant VAD issues. According to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), VAD in the Philippines affects between 1.7 and 2 million children under the age of five, while in Bangladesh it affects 20 per cent of children under five. Researchers estimate that in countries where rice is a staple of nearly every meal, Golden Rice could supply 30 to 50 per cent of the estimated average vitamin A requirement. Work first started on the biofortified rice in 1982, with several iterations developed. In July 2021, the first Golden Rice cultivation biosafety permit was granted to allow commercial-scale cultivation in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice), in collaboration with IRRI and other partners, estimated that it would take three to four seasons to produce sufficient supply of seeds for commercial farm cultivation. However, cultivation was interrupted in April 2023 when the Philippine Supreme Court ordered the propagation of Golden Rice be stopped following a petition filed by an opposing group. The petition claimed the GM rice posed risks to consumer and environmental health. The Supreme Court’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals in April this year. In an official statement, Dr John C de Leon, DA-PhilRice’s executive director, said they were reviewing the implications to prepare a response. The Agricultural Biotechnology Council of Australia is an industry initiative established to increase public awareness of, and encourage informed debate and decision-making about, gene technology.",

    "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it’s time to further disable Iran-backed militias that have struck at US forces and ships in the Middle East and the US is preparing to take significant action in response to the deaths of three US service members in Jordan. For days the US has hinted strikes are imminent. While the threat of retaliation for Sunday’s deaths has driven some militant groups to say they were stopping hostilities, as late as yesterday Yemen’s Houthi rebels were still attacking vessels and fired a ballistic missile at a Liberian-flagged container ship in the Red Sea. “At this point, it’s time to take away even more capability than we’ve taken in the past,” Austin said Thursday in his first press conference since he was hospitalised on January 1 due to complications from prostate cancer treatment. Previous US strikes have not deterred the attacks. Since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October, Iranian-backed militant groups have struck US bases in Iraq and Syria at least 166 times with rockets, missiles and one-way attack drones, drawing about a half-dozen US counterstrikes on militant facilities in both countries. The US military also has carried out airstrikes targeting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The US has attributed the attack on Tower 22 in Jordan to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes the militant group Kataib Hezbollah. While Iran has denied involvement, Austin said that “how much Iran knew or didn’t know, we don’t know. But it really doesn’t matter because Iran sponsors these groups”. Austin said, “without that facilitation, these kinds of things don’t happen”. He said the Pentagon is still looking at the forensics of the drone that struck Tower 22, a secretive base in northeastern Jordan that’s been crucial to the American presence in neighbouring Syria. “I don’t think the adversaries are of a ‘one and done’ mindset. And so they have a lot of capability. I have a lot more,” Austin said. “We’re going to do what’s necessary to protect our troops.” In the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired on commercial and military ships almost 40 times since November. In the latest attack, they fired a ballistic missile at a Liberian-flagged container ship, US defence officials said. The attack happened west of Hodeida, a port city in Yemen long held by the rebels, said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, a British military group overseeing Mideast waterways. It said the crew and the vessel were safe and the blast came far off the vessel’s starboard side. The US defence officials identified the targeted container ship as the Koi, a Bermuda-owned vessel. Its management could not be immediately reached for comment. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The Houthis did not claim responsibility for the assault. The Houthis say they are targeting ships over Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas . But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperilling shipping in a key route for global trade between Asia, the Mideast and Europe. The Houthis hit a commercial vessel with a missile, sparking a fire that burned for hours. The Pentagon has the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower in the region, along with at least a half dozen other major US warships, US Air Force fighter jets and radar aircraft. It has already been regularly using those assets to conduct strikes and defend ships. Late Wednesday, American F/A-18 fighter jets struck and destroyed 10 Houthi drones that were prepared to launch, as well as a ground control station used by the rebels, the US military said. The US also intercepted a ballistic missile and other drones already in the air during the day.",

    "title": "Don't Forget What We Did In England, Australia...: Rohit Sharma Defends India's Poor Batting Against South Africa In First Test | Cricket News, Times Now",
    "text": "India suffered an embarrassing defeat by an innings and 32 runs against South Africa in the first Test of the ongoing two-match series. In a game that finished inside three days at SuperSport Park in Centurion, Indian batters produced a shambolic show in both innings. Apart from KL Rahul’s 101 in the first inning and Virat Kohli’s 76 in the second inning, no one else was able to do justice with their talent.The Indian team, after getting an invite to bat first in the Boxing Day Test, could only manage to score 245 runs in the first inning and get all out in less than two sessions for 131 runs in the second inning. The poor show by Indian batsmen was heavily criticised by fans and experts of the game. But Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has come out in defence of his teammates and said that even though the batters did not perform up to the mark in the first Test, he was not ready to concede that they have trouble coping with the moving ball overseas.According to the 35-year-old batter, who was only able to score 5 and 0 in the first Test, there is no need to worry and criticise the batters because it is the same set of players who performed well in England and Australia in the last few years.\\\"There's no need to motivate them. They are all international cricketers. This performance is just one. Don't forget what we did in Australia and England. We won in Australia with our batting. We drew in England with batting and bowling. It's not like we don't know how to bat outside India. Sometimes the opposition plays better than you. It's not like they batted 110 overs and we couldn't even do that. You go and check the scorecards of the last four or five away tours we have done,\\\" Rohit said.\\\"Look at what KL Rahul did in the first inning. It is a perfect example of showing intent as well as respecting conditions. At the end of the day, he scored at a strike rate of 70, and he put the bad balls away. That is what we talk about intent.\\\"However, Rohit did criticise the poor bowling show by Indian pacers, who gave away more than 400 runs.\\\"This was not a 400-run wicket, and we gave up too many runs. We sprayed the ball all around, but it happens. One can’t depend on one bowler (Bumrah); the other three pacers also needed to perform their roles; we could learn from how South Africa bowled,\\\" Rohit said.\\\"Bumrah bowled well, and we all know his quality. All he wanted was a bit of support, which he didn’t get. That happens. All three tried hard, bending their backs, but it didn’t happen the way we wanted it to. But games like these teach you a lot as to what you want to do as a bowling unit,” the Indian captain added.",
