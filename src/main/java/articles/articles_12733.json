    "title": "NASA Alert! Four Massive Asteroids Speeding Towards Earth: Check Speed, Distance And Time | Times Now",
    "text": "NASA has issued a warning regarding four asteroids currently hurtling towards Earth. Although this news may sound alarming, let's examine the details to determine if there is any cause for concern. All four asteroids are classified under the Apollo group, known for occasionally intersecting Earth's orbit. Here's a closer look at each of them:Firstly, there's Asteroid 2024 JV6, measuring a relatively modest 26 feet in size. It's travelling at a staggering speed of 42,081 kilometers per hour and is set to make its closest approach to Earth on May 10th at 21:58 UTC, coming within 595,000 kilometres of our planet.Next up is Asteroid 2024 JK1, slightly larger at 58 feet. This member of the Apollo group is speeding up, moving at 43,472 kilometres per hour. However, it will pass by Earth on May 10th at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometres.Following closely behind is Asteroid 2021 JG9, measuring 100 feet in size. While it's not the largest of the group, its speed of 48,247 kilometres per hour indicates swift movement. Keep an eye out on May 10th when it approaches within 4 million kilometres of Earth.Lastly, we have Asteroid 2024 JF8, with a substantial diameter of 73 feet. This asteroid is hurtling through space at an impressive speed of 90,056 kilometres per hour. Fortunately, it will pass by Earth at a safe distance of 4 million kilometres on May 10th at 14:49.Are We Going To Die?Before jumping to conclusions, yes.Now, let's gain some perspective. While the sizes and speeds of these asteroids may seem intimidating, their closest approaches to Earth remain relatively distant. The closest any of them will get is 595,000 kilometres away – a distance greater than that of the Moon!It's crucial to remember that NASA continuously monitors near-Earth objects like these. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) diligently observes all known asteroids, evaluating any potential impact risks they may pose. By utilizing data from observatories worldwide, including contributions from amateur astronomers and NASA-funded projects, scientists can accurately track these celestial bodies and predict their trajectories.So, should you be worried? In this instance, there's no need to panic. While it's fascinating to witness these cosmic phenomena, they do not pose an immediate threat to Earth. Thanks to the vigilant surveillance efforts of organizations like NASA, we can be confident that our planet is well-guarded against any interstellar surprises.",

    "text": "Unsettled weather including strong winds, rain, and snow is expected over the weekend, Good Morning Britain reports. Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit.Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected.They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am.Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck.Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, said that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars.Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel.Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

Chrome is not enough, the Department of Justice is also seeking to divest the Android system and limit AI training. wallstreetcn · 6 mins ago GOOG -4.56% GOOGL -4.74%\n美国司法部向法庭提出要求，除了剥离其Chrome浏览器外，还要谷歌剥离安卓操作系统，并限制谷歌训练AI模型。如果提案最终被接受，谷歌将不得再拥有浏览器，并且在未来五年内不能重新进入浏览器市场。此外，谷歌还不再能够独占大量的数据资源，这些数据对于AI训练至关重要。\n$谷歌-C (GOOG.US)$ 反垄断案再度升级！近日，美国司法部向法庭提出要求，除了剥离其Chrome浏览器外，还要谷歌剥离安卓操作系统，并限制谷歌训练AI模型。\n$谷歌-A (GOOGL.US)$ 一度跌7%，收盘时跌幅收窄近5%。\n据英国《金融时报》21日报道，美国司法部在周四提交的法庭文件显示，司法部认为， 通过剥离Chrome浏览器和安卓操作系统，能够有效削弱谷歌在在线搜索市场中的主导地位。\n如果提案最终被接受，谷歌将不得再拥有浏览器，并且在未来五年内不能重新进入浏览器市场。同时，司法部还要求谷歌在六个月内剥离对搜索引擎、查询型AI产品和广告技术的投资。\n随着特朗普当选总统，并即将重新任命新一届司法部门领导，谷歌的反垄断案件正进入一个关键阶段。\n司法部要求限制谷歌AI训练内容 本周早些时候，彭博社报道称，美国司法部计划强制谷歌出售Chrome。司法部认为，剥离Chrome浏览器将允许谷歌的竞争对手争取本应拥有的市场份额，并能打破谷歌长期以来对搜索引擎市场的垄断。\n而如今，双方的矛盾再度升级。 除了剥离浏览器，司法部还要求谷歌剥离安卓系统，并限制其AI模型的训练内容。\n检察官在文件中表示：\n“由于谷歌的行为，竞争环境并不公平，谷歌的行为反映了其非法获得的优势的不义之财。补救措施必须弥补这一差距，剥夺谷歌的这些优势。”\n根据提议， 谷歌必须允许竞争对手以“边际成本”获取其搜索索引、用户和广告的数据，同时保证隐私保护。\n这意味着， 谷歌不再能够独占大量的数据资源，这些数据对于AI训练至关重要。\n司法部还表示，谷歌应当停止支付给苹果等合作伙伴数十亿美元的年费，使其搜索引擎成为默认选项的合同，这一做法已经成为谷歌在搜索引擎市场中占据主导地位的核心手段。\n2021年，谷歌支付给苹果的金额就超过200亿美元，这也帮助其确保了苹果Safari浏览器中的默认搜索引擎地位。\n谷歌强烈反对，称“影响消费者和技术竞争力” 而谷歌方面自然不甘示弱，对此提案表示强烈反对，称司法部的要求“震撼且过于激进”。\n谷歌认为， 剥离Chrome浏览器和安卓操作系统将对消费者造成损害， 因为这些产品目前是免费的，且谷歌将其作为“亏损引流工具”，用于推广其搜索引擎和广告业务。特别是没有其他公司能够投入足够的资金，来保持浏览器的安全性和竞争力。\n此外，谷歌还表示， 这一要求可能会对其在AI领域的投资产生严重影响，进而削弱其全球技术领导地位。\n目前，案件仍在审理之中，法官Amit Mehta预计将在2025年中做出是否接受这些补救措施的决定。如果该提案被采纳，将是美国反垄断部门对谷歌反垄断打击的历史性胜利。\n然而，随着特朗普即将出任美国总统，司法部反垄断行动的前景也充满不确定性。 如果他重新任命新一届司法部门领导，是否继续对谷歌采取如此严厉的措施将成为一个悬而未决的问题。 此外，特朗普政府是否会改变现有的反垄断政策，亦尚不明确。\n编辑/jayden\nThe US Department of Justice has requested the court to not only require Google to divest its Chrome browser, but also to separate Google from the Android operating system and restrict Google from training AI models. If the proposal is ultimately accepted, Google will no longer be able to own a browser and will not be able to re-enter the browser market in the next five years. In addition, Google will no longer be able to monopolize a large amount of data resources, which are crucial for AI training.\n$Alphabet-C (GOOG.US)$ Antitrust case escalates again! Recently, the usa Department of Justice requested the court to require google to not only divest its Chrome browser but also to divest the Android operating system and limit google's training of AI models.\n$Alphabet-A (GOOGL.US)$ It once fell by 7%, with the decline narrowing to nearly 5% at the close.\nAccording to the Financial Times of the United Kingdom reported on the 21st, court documents submitted by the US Department of Justice on Thursday show that the Department of Justice believes that by divesting the Chrome browser and the Android operating system, it can effectively weaken Google's dominant position in the online search market.\nIf the proposal is ultimately accepted, Google will no longer have a browser and will not be able to re-enter the browser market in the next five years. At the same time, the Department of Justice also requires Google to divest investments in search engines, query-based AI products, and advertising technology within six months.\nWith the election of President Trump and the imminent reappointment of the new leadership of the Department of Justice, Google's antitrust case is entering a critical stage.\nDepartment of Justice requests to limit Google's AI training content. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the US Department of Justice plans to compel Google to sell Chrome. The Department of Justice believes that divesting the Chrome browser will allow Google's competitors to compete for the market share they should have and break Google's long-standing monopoly in the search engine market.\nNow the conflict between the two parties has escalated again. In addition to divesting the browser, the Department of Justice also requires Google to divest the Android system and limit the training content of its AI models.\nThe prosecutor stated in the document:\nDue to Google's actions, the competitive environment is unfair, and Google's behavior reflects unjust gains obtained illegally. Remedial measures must bridge this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\nAccording to the proposal, Google must allow competitors to access its search index, users, and advertising data at 'marginal cost', while ensuring privacy protection.\nThis means that Google will no longer be able to monopolize a large amount of data resources crucial for AI training.\nThe Department of Justice also stated that Google should stop paying annual fees of billions of dollars to partners like Apple, to make its search engine the default option through contracts, which has become a core tactic for Google to dominate the search engine market.\nIn 2021, Google paid Apple over 20 billion US dollars, helping to secure its position as the default search engine in Apple's Safari browser.\nGoogle strongly opposes, stating it will 'harm consumers and technological competitiveness'. Google naturally refuses to back down, strongly objecting to the proposal, deeming the Department of Justice's demands 'shocking and overly aggressive'.\nGoogle believes that separating the Chrome browser and the Android operating system would harm consumers because these products are currently free, and Google uses them as a \"loss-leading tool\" to promote its search engine and advertising business. In particular, no other company can invest enough funds to maintain the security and competitiveness of the browser.\nIn addition, Google also stated that this requirement may seriously impact its investments in the field of AI, thereby weakening its global technological leadership position.\nCurrently, the case is still under review, and Judge Amit Mehta is expected to make a decision on whether to accept these remedies by mid-2025. If the proposal is adopted, it will be a historic victory for the US antitrust department's crackdown on Google's antitrust practices.\nHowever, with Trump about to assume the presidency of the United States, the future of the Justice Department's antitrust actions is also uncertain. If he appoints new leadership of the Justice Department, whether to continue such severe measures against Google will become a pending question. In addition, it is not yet clear whether the Trump administration will change the existing antitrust policies.\nEditor / jayden\nThe translation is provided by third-party software.\nThe above content is for informational or educational purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice related to Futu.

    "text": "L a AEMET ya ha publicado las previsiones que se esperan para este fin de semana. Estos días la península se ha mantenido bajo un anticiclón, lo que hará que las temperaturas altas que se han visto durante las primeras semanas de mayo en gran parte de la península se sigan manteniendo a lo largo del fin de semana. También por la noche, la previsión es que las temperaturas continúen en alza y aumentando.\nSin embargo, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología avisa sobre la llegada de una vaguada al territorio. Por lo que las altas temperaturas también se verán en amenazas, en concreto el sábado, 11 de mayo, por las llegadas de los posibles chubascos, concentrados sobre todo en el noroeste peninsular, mientras que en otros puntos es posible que se alcancen los 33 grados. Aunque no hay todavía una información más detallada de qué puntos concretos sufrirán estas lluvias, eso sí, tanto el sur como el este del país no tienen por qué preocuparse, ya que no sufrirán esta inestabilidad e incluso podrían tener un ligero aumento de las temperaturas.\nEl domingo las lluvias harán más presencia Los chubascos sí que tomarán mucha más fuerza a partir del domingo, 12 de mayo, y las zonas de España sobre las que descargará esa lluvia son: Galicia, el Cantábrico y Castilla y León. En zonas como el Valle del Ebro, el sur de Zaragoza, Badajoz y Toledo, la situación meteorológica no será la misma que en los anteriores sitios mencionados, ya que las temperaturas van a seguir manteniendo unos niveles bastante altos, llegando incluso a los 32 grados.\nAsí que la estabilidad que reinaba estos días en la península se acabará con la llegada de esta vaguada, que se comenzará a notar a partir del sábado, aunque sí tendrá más presencia el último día de esta semana, con tormentas que pueden llegar a ser muy intensas en zonas como Soria, Zaragoza y Teruel.",

    "text": "'Lo que queremos es paz': AMLO tras petición de SRE a CPI sobre Palestina\nEl presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador reiteró su postura de neutralidad ante el conflicto entre Israel y Hamás, pero aseguró que se debe buscar un alto al fuego y la paz.\n- Redacción AN / FPR\nEl presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador reiteró su postura de neutralidad frente a la guerra entre Israel y el grupo islamista Hamás en Gaza, después de que la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE) mexicana pidiera a la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) que investigara los crímenes cometidos en Palestina.\n“Nosotros lo que queremos es la paz. No tomamos partido por ninguna de las partes”, declaró este viernes durante su conferencia de prensa matutina en Palacio Nacional.\n“Lo que no queremos es que inocentes pierdan la vida”, subrayó.\nEl mandatario descartó pronunciarse a favor de Israel, Hamás o los palestinos. Sin embargo, se posicionó en contra de la guerra.\n“Todo lo que podamos hacer para ayudar al diálogo, a la paz, en este lamentable enfrentamiento”, expresó.\n“Lo que está en el fondo, lo que debe de preocuparnos a todos es que se están perdiendo vidas y no podemos ser insensibles”, aseveró.\nAMLO dijo que “no se trata de condenar a nadie, sino buscar cómo parar” la guerra, que calificó como “inhumana y cruel”.\nTe puede interesar >\nEmbajada de Israel lamentó solicitud de México sobre Palestina ante la CPI\nEsto a pesar de que la tarde del jueves, la SRE reveló que el Gobierno mexicano, junto a Chile, pidió a la CPI que “investigue la probable comisión de crímenes de su competencia” en Palestina ante la agudización del conflicto en Gaza.\n“Eso tarda mucho”, expresó López Obrador sobre dicha petición.\nAMLO reiteró que lo primero que se debe de buscar es el alto al fuego “por un tiempo” mientras “actúa la diplomacia”.\n“Mi propuesta es cese al fuego y un tiempo para que los diplomáticos hagan su trabajo de reconciliación, con diálogo y buscando acuerdos”, apuntó.\nLa decisión de la cancillería mexicana fue reprobada por la Embajada israelí en México y reiteró que “Israel mantiene el legítimo derecho de autodefensa en conformidad con el Derecho Internacional”.\nEsta medida, que Chile había anunciado primero el 11 de enero, es diferente a la demanda por genocidio que interpuso Sudáfrica contra Israel en la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) en diciembre pasado.\nAMLO ha reiterado varias veces la postura de “neutralidad” de México ante el conflicto, que estalló el 7 de octubre con una agresión del grupo islamista Hamás que dejó 1,200 muertos en Israel, cuyo Gobierno respondió con ataques que han causado más de 24 mil muertos en Gaza.",

    "title": "3 Key Areas to Watch Ahead of the November 2024 Election | Investing.com NG",
    "text": "Super Tuesday was, if I may, super obvious. Former President Donald Trump clinched nearly every delegate that was up for grabs last week, forcing his Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, out of the race, which all but guarantees his nomination. Trump’s poll numbers, as aggregated by RealClearPolitics, also show him pulling further ahead of President Joe Biden, whose own favorability remains in the doldrums as the border crisis continues unabated. Eight months remain until the general election, but I don’t believe it’s too soon for investors to prepare for a potential second Trump term. And let’s be clear: Trump, should he win, would be constitutionally limited to a single additional term, the same as Biden. Since the current administration has reversed a number of Trump-era policies—especially those involving immigration—Trump and lawmakers would need to work fast to implement new legislation and policies before the end of those four years. Below are three areas for investors to watch in the event of a Trump victory this November. - Immigration and Border Security Immigration is the top issue on most Americans’ minds right now, according to a recent Gallup poll; it’s also arguably the topic most associated with Trump. Since Biden took office in 2021, a record number of undocumented migrants have poured into the U.S., alarming families and businesses alike and straining many communities’ infrastructure and resources. So far in fiscal 2024, which began in October 2023, there have been nearly 1 million recorded migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, exceeding the total amount in most previous years. The U.S. now has a record number of foreign-born people living within its borders at 49.5 million, or 15% of the total population, the Census Bureau reported in October. Should voters put Trump back in the White House, I expect we’ll see swift action on the immigration front. We’ll likely see the re-implementation of old Trump policies, including “Remain in Mexico,” and as recently as last month, the former president vowed to enact “the largest deportation operation in American history.” A majority of Americans, or 53%, now support building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a Monmouth University poll conducted in February. The bottom line is that people want to feel safe. Safety is a fundamental need on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, alongside food and water, and Americans are increasingly feeling unsafe. - Small-Cap Stocks Ready for a Rebound? During President Trump’s administration, U.S. small-cap stocks, as measured by the [Russell 2000](/indices/smallcap-2000), performed competitively with the [S&P 500](/indices/us-spx-500) as Trump shifted the government’s attention to domestic policy. This—coupled with the 2017 tax reform law, a historic wave of deregulation, low borrowing costs and low inflation—helped smaller, “America first” companies thrive. Today, the market looks very different. Since the start of Biden’s presidency, the S&P 500 has advanced almost 40%, with the lion’s share of those gains occurring in the last four months as investors, anticipating rate cuts in 2024, scrambled to get exposure to large artificial intelligence (AI) stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: [MSFT](/equities/microsoft-corp)), Alphabet (NASDAQ: [GOOGL](/equities/google-inc)) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: [NVDA](/equities/nvidia-corp)). The Russell 2000, by comparison, has remained essentially flat over the same period. What this means is that small-caps are now at their lowest valuation relative to large-caps since the dotcom bubble more than 20 years ago. A buying opportunity? Like immigration, I believe a second Trump term would hit the ground running supporting domestic-focused, Mom and Pop-style stores and businesses. During his administration, optimism among small U.S. businesses consistently ran high, with the National Federation of Independent Business’s (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index hitting an all-time high reading of 108.8 in August 2018. Since that time, the index has fallen more than 17%, registering 89.9 in January 2024. - Recommitment to U.S. Energy The last area I want to touch on is energy, which many voters and investors also associate with Trump. During his administration, gasoline prices remained on the lower end as producers kept the oil flowing. This came to a screeching halt four years ago with the pandemic, but since then, the U.S. has regained its status as the world’s leading supplier of crude. In December 2023, the last month of available data, the U.S. produced a jaw-dropping 13.3 million barrels per day on average. This resulted in a new record amount of oil pumped in a single year, surpassing the previous record set in 2019 when the U.S. produced 4.49 billion barrels. Interestingly, producers managed to do this even as the number of active oil rigs in North America has continue to trend down. According to Baker Hughes, there were 506 active rigs at the beginning of March 2024, down approximately 70% from the high in October 2014. So what gives? A new report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) asks this very question, finding that new and improved technologies, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling, “have increased well productivity, enabling U.S. producers to extract more [crude oil](/commodities/crude-oil) from new wells drilled while maintaining production from legacy wells.” Producers, in other words, are able to do much more today with far less. As such, Trump 2.0 would have even less incentive to continue subsidizing renewable energy development. Last year, it was reported that he would “gut” the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Biden’s centerpiece climate legislation, chockfull of tax incentives, funding and loans to help the economy transition to clean energy. *** Disclaimer: Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Estas canchas son multipropósito (voleibol, baloncesto, fútbol sala o de salón).\nFoto | Cortesía alcaldía de Manizales | LA PATRIA\nEn un sitio contiguo al estadio Palogrande y la cancha auxiliar se adecuó un lugar para la práctica de voley-arena, con lo que se amplía la oferta de deportes en esa céntrica zona de la ciudad, la Unidad Deportiva Palogrande.\nLa modernización llegó al Bosque Popular\nEl parqueadero principal fue demarcado y remodelado, quedó con capacidad para 73 vehículos y 31 motos, además se diseñó una zona exclusiva para ambulancias.\nLa segunda inauguración, la de este jueves 26 de diciembre, se dio en el Bosque Popular el Prado, donde con una inversión de $2.200 millones se le dio otra vida al gran pulmón usado por miles de familias manizaleñas, que según el alcalde Rojas, \"es la finca de quienes no tenemos finca\".\nAseguró que: \"este es el epicentro de la recreación en Manizales, en un fin de semana pueden venir de 15 a 20 mil personas un fin de semana y gratuitamente pueden disfrutar de disciplinas como el golf, tenis de campo, atletismo, natación, baloncestos, fútbol, bmx y tiro con arco, entre otros\".\nPara quienes llevan tiempo sin ir al Bosque, lo encontrarán renovado, de entrada le impactará la amplitud de la vía de acceso que ahora es de seis metros y permite la circulación fluida en ambos sentidos. Además se asfaltó y se le construyeron bermas.\nCon la construcción de bahías de parqueo, para 83 vehículos, se busca ponerle fin al que parecía un eterno problema de embotellamiento y desorden que reinaba en el parque y que afectaba la movilidad.\nModernizaron cuatro canchas de tenis de campo, además se construyó un sendero que permite el paso de sillas de ruedas y de coches de bebés para disfrutar en familia. Además se incorporó una pista de 1.400 metros para práctica de atletismo.\nTambién se construyó un sendero de 1.4 kilómetros que recorre gran parte del lugar y es óptimo para atletas, construyeron una nueva batería sanitaria, se arregló el piso y techo del edificio principal donde funciona la cafetería y además se le hizo mantenimiento a las 4 canchas de tenis de campo.\n\"Se ha venido ampliando la oferta del Bosque Popular con la pista de patinaje que se entregó recientemente y se le hizo mantenimiento a la pista de bmx, por eso invitamos a los manizaleños a esta zona que se modernizó por completo para el disfrute de todos\", puntualizó Rojas.",
