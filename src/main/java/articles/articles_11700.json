    "text": "Essequibo: Venezuela sends troops to border, Guyana says it has 'no plan' for attack In the midst of the crisis over Essequibo, an oil-rich territory claimed by Venezuela, some 5,600 Venezuelan troops are taking part in military exercises of a \"defensive\" nature ordered Thursday by President Nicolas Maduro in \"response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom,\" which has sent a warship to Guyana. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro meets with staff at the Ministry of Defense in Caracas, Dec. 28, 2023. © Jhonn Zerpa/Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS By: RFI Follow Advertising Read More As the two Latin American countries vie over the Essequibo region, interference from the United Kingdom, of which Guyana has long been a colony, is seen as a provocation to Venezuela. On Sunday 24 December, London announced the deployment of a military patrol ship, HMS Trent. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced on Thursday, December 28, a \"defensive\" military action by Venezuela in the face of the \"threat\" of a British ship in Guyana. In total, more than 5,600 Venezuelan soldiers have been taking part in military manoeuvres of a \"defensive\" nature since Thursday, December 28. \"I have ordered the activation of a joint action of all the [Venezuelan] Bolivarian National Armed Forces in the Eastern Caribbean, on the Atlantic coast, a joint action of a defensive nature, in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against the peace and sovereignty of our country,\" President Maduro said during a radio and television broadcast. in which he showed images of warships and fighter jets patrolling the area. Read alsoEssequibo: \"the effects of the announcement have not been followed by effects\" Tensions have been exacerbated for several months For his part, Guyana's Vice President, Bharrat Jagdeo, is trying to ease tensions with his words. \"We have no plan to take offensive measures against Venezuela... We have no intention of invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and should not be worried,\" he told a news conference. He also said the arrival of a British patrol boat in Guyana's waters was part of \"routine exercises that have been planned for a long time\". This territorial dispute, which has existed since 1899, has returned to the forefront of the news with the launch, last September, of oil tenders by Guyana, followed by the referendum held on 3 December in Venezuela on a proposal to annex Essequibo. This 160,000 km2 territory, rich in oil and natural resources, administered by Georgetown but claimed by Venezuela, covers two-thirds of Guyana's land area. It is home to about 125,000 people, or one-fifth of the country's population. Read alsoVenezuela-Guyana: could the crisis degenerate into conflict?

    "title": "New Samsung accessible tablet will have 2 important improvements - Aroged",
    "text": "Soon, it is expected that Samsung launches its new accessible tablet model: the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe. At this stage, the official information is scarce, but we will already know some leaks about what to expect from this new tablet.\nHighlight for the “jump” on the screen and the RAM\nIt should be noted that the series should come out with two different models: the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe and the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe+. Two of the main improvements to be felt in this Samsung series have to do with the screen, RAM and storage capacity.\nAs explained by Notebook Checkthe standard version screen should keep the 10.9 inches of the previous version. The S10 Fe+ model, on the other hand, should jump from the 12.4 S9 Fe+ to 13.1 inches.\nIn this way, as the same source of information refers, the “S10 Fe+” version will be higher than the Galaxy Tab S10+, which has a 12.4 inch screen. It remains to be clarified if the screens will be AMOLED or LCD.\nIn terms of memory, the international press has advanced that the RAM could rise up to 12 GB of RAM and storage up to 256 GB.\nOther possibilities for the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe\nIn addition to the previously mentioned aspects, it is estimated that the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe can be powered by an Exynos 1580 processor. To add to this, it is expected to have an optional pen, 5G IP68 resistance against water and dust.\nAs Aroged previously reported, Samsung has published a teaser about the upcoming mobile phones. This is presumably the A26, A36 and A56, where they will go from 4 years of updates to the age of 6. It wouldn’t be strange that with the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe happen the same thing.\nOnce again, it is never too much to reinforce that the data is not yet made official by Samsung. Until the launch happens, you can always find for sale, in Amazon Spain, the previous generation.",

    "text": "Monday, January 15th 2024, 10:53 am The City of Tulsa road crews have been out since midnight to treat roads after snowfall covered most of eastern Oklahoma. At the salt barns, a steady amount of trucks have been going in and out to treat the roads in the city. This morning, crews stopped plowing and turned to salt to help with snow melt. City officials said that while all main roads are passable, the focus is now on treating turn lanes and slick spots. AAA Spokeswoman Rylie Fletcher said before you hit the road, you should open your hood and check for any visible deterioration. Always check the air pressure in your tires because with every 10 degrees drop, your tires can lose one pound of pressure. Remember to find a safe place to pull over if you have trouble. Always put on your hazard lights and stay in your vehicle. Fletcher said the most important thing you can do is slow down, because you don’t want to be in a situation where your car slides across the road. “Whether that be when you’re hitting the brakes, whether you're hitting the gas pedal, even your speed in general. Do those actions slower than you would typically do on a dry road. Those conditions out there that we might see coming into this weekend, your car can slip really easily if there’s any slickness on the road or if it's icy out there,\" Fletcher said. If you must get on the road, make sure you allow extra time to get where you’re going. John 3:16 Mission, 506 N. Cheyenne Ave.: open 24-7 The Salvation Army Center of Hope, 102 N.

    "title": "Baby rescued from Gaza rubble after mother killed in air strike - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "RAFAH: The rescuers in orange vests shouted as they reached a baby girl still alive in the rubble of an Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip’s Rafah city after yet another night of bombardment of the Palestinian enclave. Baby Mariam Abu Akel’s skin was grey with dust and she made little noises as the rescuers reached deep into the rubble to free her legs and lift her clear. People crowded around in the ruins of the Abu Edwan family’s house, where Mariam’s family had been sheltering after they fled their own home in a more dangerous area near Gaza’s border with Israel. The air strike killed 20 people and wounded 55, according to health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al Qidra. The Abu Edwan house had been sheltering many displaced people like the Abu Akel family. Most of Gaza’s population have had to flee their homes in the face of a withering bombardment and ground offensive. Mariam’s mother and sister were both killed in the strike along with members of the Abu Edwan family and people from other families temporarily living with them. Her father and brother Hamed, still a toddler, survived the blast. When Mariam was lifted free, a rescuer ran with her in his arms to take her to hospital. Doctors there swabbed her cuts. ‘I was shaking’ Rafah’s hospitals were already dealing with the nightly influx of wounded people taken out of bombed houses. Nadeen Abdulatif, 13, stood by a pile of debris next to the Rafah house where she and her family had taken shelter after their own home in Gaza City was ruined by an air strike targeting the building next door, which killed her older brother. She could not stop thinking about being killed, or her other brother dying, she said. The air strike during the night had blown out the windows and rattled the building. “My brother was shaking. I was shaking. I was scared. I didn’t move from my place because of how terrified I was,” she said. At another air strike site, rescuers had pulled out two infant girls. In an ambulance, medics sponged a thick layer of dust from their faces as a badly bleeding boy sat opposite them, dazed. In the hospital, children lay for treatment on the floor. A boy with bandages around his head and blood covering his face was crying. Next to him lay another boy with a brace around his neck. The two little girls lay on a stretcher.

    "text": "The watchdog organization Campaign Legal Center accuses Minnesota GOP Senate candidate Royce White of improperly spending campaign funds on personal use including buying jewelry and going to strip clubs in a Federal Elections Commission (FEC) complaint.\n“Royce White for Congress reported disbursing over $157,000 to a variety of vendors for clothing, cosmetics, jewelry, resort charges, fitness, and entertainment, including at strip clubs and nightclubs,” the FEC complaint alleges.\nThe complaint outlines a laundry list of expenses which it alleges “appear to be of a personal nature.”\nWhite’s campaign reported spending thousands of dollars at retail outlets like Amazon , Walmart and Target, according to the complaint. It also spent thousands on a gym membership, beauty and cosmetic supplies and a trip to Kalahari Resorts, an African safari-themed water park in Wisconsin, the complaint alleges.\nOther notable expenses included $365 for supplements from Onnit, a health and fitness brand co-owned by Joe Rogan , and multiple $2000 purchases at a Best Buy, according to the complaint. (RELATED: Nearly Three Years And $1,200,000,000,000 Later, Biden Has Almost Nothing To Show For His Biggest Domestic Achievement)\n“That complete lack of transparency, in view of the campaign’s prolific spending on clothing, entertainment, vacations, and personal items indicates an obvious effort to conceal personal use by moving funds out of the campaign’s account, ensuring that the actual use of those funds remained hidden from the public,” the complaint alleges.\nThe complaint further alleges that White’s campaign only listed one official disbursement despite appearing to have a professional website and professionally edited campaign videos which likely would have been paid for in campaign funds. The complaint also alleges that the campaign had multiple lapses in having an official treasurer, an omission it says is a violation of U.S. Code on elections.\n“That’s all campaign stuff,” White told the Daily Beast in a response to a question regarding his campaign’s spending. “Every dollar was spent on the campaign for campaign reasons.”\nThe complaint cites his comment to the Daily Beast.\n“If the FEC wants to fine us, that’s completely fine, there are much bigger scams with political campaigns,” he reportedly said regarding his 2022 campaign, according to the complaint.\nWhite, a former NBA player and high draft pick, received the Minnesota GOP endorsement in May to challenge incumbent Democrat Amy Klobuchar for her Senate seat.",

    "title": "Centre admitted AAP govt has managed to reduce air pollution in Delhi, claims AAP",
    "text": "NEW DELHI: AAP on Thursday said the central government in its Economic Survey Report 2022-23 admitted that the air quality in the capital has continuously improved, an achievement accomplished by the dedicated efforts of the city government.\nCiting the report, AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, “In the beginning of 2023, an Economic Survey Report 2022-23 was tabled in the Parliament, which said the air in Delhi has continuously improved since 2016. Seeing this report, a sense of optimism is generated that if there is political will and good intention, then air can be controlled, and air quality can also be improved,” she said.\nListing the contributions of the AAP-led government, Kakkar said, “The green cover of Delhi is at a historic high today. About 1,800 industries in Delhi have all been converted to PNG fuel, a clean fuel. Electricity is available round-the-clock for industrial, commercial, and residential purposes, due to which the use of polluting diesel-based generators has completely ended in Delhi.”\nMentioning the role of electric buses in bringing down air pollution in the city, Kakkar said CM Kejriwal has decided that the carbon dioxide emitted into the air by public transport should also be controlled, envisioning that by 2025, 80% of the buses in Delhi will be electric.\nAs of now, the total number of buses in Delhi is 7,582, which is the highest number till date. Of these, 1,650 are e-buses, i.e. about 22% of the total fleet has already become electric.\n“When we started introducing electric buses in Delhi in 2022, the 47,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by these buses was controlled as a part of the fleet transitioned to electric. A massive contribution has been made in controlling pollution through these electric buses,” she said.\nThe AAP spokesperson said the 1,650 e-buses in Delhi is not only the highest number of electric buses in the country but also third in the world.\n“In view of this, a question arises that if CM Kejriwal has done so much in the war against pollution in such a short time, then why are other governments not capable of doing the same. Don’t they have political will, intention, determination?” she added.\n‘22% of fleet comprised of e-buses’\nAs of now, the total number of buses in Delhi is 7,582, the highest number till date. Of these, 1,650 are e-buses, i.e. about 22% of the total fleet is comprised of e-buses. The 1,650 e-buses in the Delhi is the highest in the country and the third in the world, AAP asserted saying it has significantly reduced vehicular emissions, thus bringing down pollution.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
