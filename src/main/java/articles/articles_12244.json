    "text": "CONNECTICUT (WTNH) — The Supreme Court rejected a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family, who own the company, from civil lawsuits over the toll of opioids.\nThe settlement also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.\nDoug Schumann, who is part of the class-action lawsuit, says he’s feels “dismayed and left out in the cold” that he will not receive any money from the now-defunct settlement.\nSchumann battled an opioid for several years after he was diagnosed with pancreatic disease.\n“It’s ridiculous that all these people suffered from these people pushing this drug on everybody, and I was looking forward towards getting some money from them,” he said.\nThis decision also affects treatment clinics, like Root Center for Advanced Recovery, which serves 6,000 patients battling addiction statewide.\n“We see a lot of barriers and challenges with mental health and substance use populations as it is, day-to-day,” Director of Operations Ashley Hickey said. “To hear that there’s going to be yet another barrier and challenge in another area that could have been a really big support for some of our patients and families and loved ones, it’s very disheartening to hear and see.”\nBut it’s far from disheartening for Christine Gagnon on the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Committee. Gagnon lost her 22-year-old son, Michael, in 2017 to opioids. She says the ruling puts accountability on the Sackler family.\n“They are now going to have to personally face the music,” she said. “If they were willing to give $6B dollars, and make sure they were protected, there’s more money there.”\n“Though I understand how the money promised by the Sackler family if their bankruptcy filing was approved could be useful, I also think there is a larger message here to all corporations in America who put themselves above the harm that they sometimes do to the average citizen,” John Lalley, who runs the advocacy group, ‘Today I am,’ said.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal continued by saying that the Sacklers are “directly to blame” for the delay in compensation.\n“Under the Sacklers, Purdue Pharma destroyed lives and ravaged communities,” Blumenthal said. “The plain fact is these victims direly need justice as soon as possible, and my hope is that their long-awaited and deeply deserved just remedies will be provided as soon as possible.”",

    "text": "‘The phone traffic is exploding’: Bend car repair shop sees increase in business during snow season (Update: PD Data Hub numbers can vary from police counts; Adding video, comments by police, body shop) BEND, Ore. (KTVZ) – With the slick driving conditions resulting in more accidents, more cars are in need of repairs. Bend Police say they have responded to nearly 50 crash calls since Jan. 1, including eight hit-and-runs. \"Last year -- overall, that number combined was 2,305 calls for service for crashes and hit and runs,\" Police Communications Manager Sheila Miller said Thursday. \"Obviously, there can be more than one call for service, but typically they are combined, if it's the same incident.\" Weather plays a major role in crashes. Miller said, \"You might see that the speed limit says 35 miles per hour. That doesn't mean that conditions call for you to drive that fast. It could be that it's only safe enough to drive 25 miles per hour.\" At Lithia Body and Paint of Bend, about 100 cars are repaired each month. During the winter season, it doubles. General Manager Ryan Sharp said Thursday, \"This week, along with the recent storms, not only are we seeing a lot of towings coming our way, but the phone traffic is exploding.\" These days about 20 to 30 calls are answered a day. He said they have totaled three cars in the last two weeks. Sharp said, \"Usually the front end hits, where people have slid into something else. So the severity is a lot more extreme in those hits. Normally, we average each repair order is about $2,600. But these winter season hits are, you know, more of the double-digit, $10,000 plus.\" It’s inevitable that more crashes occur when the roads turn slick, snowy and icy. But where and when the \"calls for service\" happen is now part of a wide array of crime and police data the public can see, in numbers and tables or on an interactive map, at [http://policedata.bendoregon.gov](http://policedata.bendoregon.gov). You can check any type of call type over any timeframe, from water rescues to weapons offenses. There's a caveat: As with much technology, data or otherwise, the public figures may be somewhat different than what police are able to compile, in terms of data collection. Miller acknowledged that \"it's a little complicated,\" but said a unique identifier number police use gets duplicated in some of their systems. Officers have a program that removes those duplicates, for a more distinct count than what the public data hub now offers. \"We left the duplicate counts in the data hub because we cannot be sure which incident number a member of the public may have and want to look at,\" she said. For that reason, the data hub's front page advises users that the numbers \"may vary slightly from the official totals, once investigations are concluded. Don't rely solely on this data for official purposes, as it's subject to change.\" They also round address locations to the nearest block, to protect victims' privacy. Based on the department's internal dashboard, Bend Police have responded to 46 MVA calls since Jan. 1 and eight hit-and-runs. The numbers are somewhat higher on the data hub map. Miller acknowledged that crash numbers go up on days of snowy, icy streets, but the higher summer tourist numbers push up traffic - and crash - counts, making for more challenging comparisons. If you're in a crash where no one is hurt, and the cars can still be driven ,you don't need to call the police. But you will need to exchange insurance and other formation with the other involved driver(s).",

In fact, just days before Mr. Biden was scheduled to appear for his deposition, the President claimed he had not interacted with any of his son's business partners. This is false. The President has met with, spoken to, and received money sourced from his son's foreign business partners,\" Comer and Jordan said in a joint statement .",

    "text": "The Detroit Pistons historic losing streak extended to 28-straight games and counting after they suffered a 128-122 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics . To add insult injury the Pistons blew a 21-point they accumulated during the second quarter to tie the longest losing streak in NBA history. Detroit's shocking streak had given them sole possession of the NBA record for the longest season single streak in league history on Tuesday following a defeat to the Brooklyn Nets . Detroit's embarrassing loss to the Celtics now ties the mark set by the Philadelphia 76ers during a losing run that spanned the 2014-15 season to the 2015-16 seasons. 'I'm unbelievably proud of the group, the way they bring it,' Pistons head coach Monty Williams said. The Pistons blew a 21-point first half lead against the Celtics to extent their losing streak Detroit is now tied for the longest-ever losing streak in NBA history with the 76ers at 28 games Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis led the game with 35 points and fueled Boston's win 'They've heard all the stuff about our team and they just keep bringing it. I know it's going to pay off.' Detroit was able to jump out to a massive advantage early on and led by 19 points as the game entered halftime. Their lead had reached as high as 21 points during the first half. Things took an unbelievable turn during the third quarter however, after the Celtics were able to battle back and tie things up at 82-82 heading into the fourth quarter thanks to a 23-7 run. Pistons superstar guard Cade Cunningham followed up his tremendous 41-point performance in Tuesday's historic loss by scoring a team-high 31 as Detroit tried to win game since October 28. 'I'm not interested in just winning one more game this year -- you know what I mean? To stop this. That would be soft, in my opinion,' said Cunningham. 'Our goals are a lot higher than that. We have what it takes to win a game, that's nothing. But to put games together, to find our system, find what's clicking and allow us to sustain winning. That's all we're looking for.' Cunnigham had picked up an incredible 22 points during the first half alone before finishing the game with his grand totals of 31 pts, nine assists, and six rebounds. 'We're on the same level as all these teams were playing against,' said Cunningham. 'There's no team that I've ever come across in the NBA where I felt like I was going into a slaughterhouse. I've never felt like that in my life, going into a basketball game. 'So every game we should be able to fight teams and impose our will on them. We did that early on. We kind of let go of the rope a little bit in the third quarter. But there's a lot of growth, and something we can learn from and definitely take to the next game.' Boston on the other hand were led by center Kristaps Porzingis who ended the night with a game-high 35 pts, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Celtics small forward Jayson Tatum ended the game with 31 pts, 10 asts, eight rebs, and five steals to pick up one of his most important double-doubles on the season. Cade Cunningham led the Pistons effort and scored a team-high 31 points during the loss Pistons coach Monty Williams was 'unbelievably proud of the group, the way they bring it' The game was nearly decided in the final seconds when Cunningham was called for a goaltending violation with 8.7 seconds left as Tatum attempted a shot to break a 106-106 tie and give the Celtics a two-point advantage. Pistons forward Bojan Bogdanovic was able to secure a put back layup with less than five seconds left to force the game into overtime. After overtime guard Derrick White began playing like a man possessed to ensure the Celtics avoided an embarrassing loss on their home court. White ended the night with 23 points. Detroit's next chance to end their losing ways will be on Saturday night against the Toronto Raptors. If the Pistons suffer another loss against Toronto, it will give them sole possession of the longest losing streak in NBA history at 29 games.",

    "text": "National Enquirer editor said Stormy Daniels' affair story was true: Texts shown to jury Kinsey Crowley , Aysha Bagchi USA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nKey players in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial Key players in former President Donald Trump's criminal charges in New York over hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Tabloid executive David Pecker testified Thursday that National Enquirer's top editor thought porn star Stormy Daniels' alleged sexual relationship with Donald Trump was a true story.\nOn the seventh day of Trump's trial for 34 counts of falsifying business records, Pecker, the former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., took the witness stand again.\nAfter testifying about the calls that led to the publication paying former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for rights to her story, including an alleged affair with Trump, Pecker recounted internal discussions about Daniels. Trump denies Daniels' claim and that he broke any laws.\nThe jury saw texts between Pecker and Dylan Howard, the editor in chief at the National Enquirer at the time. Pecker said Howard was unable to travel for the trial, but Thursday's testimony provided insight about what the publication thought about Daniels' story.\nTrump trial live updates: David Pecker testifies about contract with Karen McDougal\n'This story is true:' Dylan Howard texted David Pecker about Stormy Daniels Howard texted Pecker that a woman wanted $120,000 for her story, according to texts shown to the jury at Trump's hush money trial.\nPecker testified the woman he was referencing was Stormy Daniels.\n\"I know the denials were made in the past – but this story is true,\" Howard's texts shown to the jurors said, adding that the woman had other offers from \"Mail\" and \"GMA.\"\nPecker testified he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story Pecker said he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story. He texted Dylan Howard: \"We can't pay 120k.\" Pecker explained on the stand that he was not a bank and had already paid hush money to Dino Sajudin and Karen McDougal to help Trump.\nSajudin was a doorman at Trump Tower who alleged Trump had a love child with a housekeeper in the building. Pecker testified Tuesday that he did not believe Sajudin's story.\nPecker also said he didn't want to be involved with a porn star.\n\"Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there, and handle,\" Howard responded to Pecker, referring to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, according to text messages displayed to the jury.\nAfter Pecker refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story, Cohen was upset and told Pecker the boss \"would be furious with me,\" Pecker testified. Pecker still insisted he wouldn't go forward with purchasing it.\nWho is Stormy Daniels? Stormy Daniels , born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump's subsequent reimbursement of Cohen, which he listed as legal expenses, is at the heart of prosecutors' allegation that the payments constituted an illegal campaign contribution by Cohen that Trump tried to hide by falsifying records.\nWho is David Pecker? David Pecker , former CEO and president of American Media Inc., is the first witness on the stand at Trump's Manhattan criminal trial .\nPecker has testified that he was frequently in touch with Michael Cohen leading up to the 2016 election. Pecker said he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" about women selling stories about Trump, as part of a bigger effort to try to help his presidential campaign.\nThe company was also fined $187,500 by the FEC for helping Trump's election, but the Justice Department granted Pecker immunity from prosecution.\nContributing: Bart Jansen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "title": "'I'm a professional witch with my own coven and I'm already planning my spells for 2024' - Nottinghamshire Live",
    "text": "A professional witch from [Newark who previously conjured up the purchase of a house](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/newark) is planning her spells for 2024. Lilith Wildwood, also a psychotherapist, runs a coven over Zoom and will create an altar with her magical tools on display before burning notes of negative feelings from the past year and manifesting what she wants to achieve in 2024 The 54-year-old had her first out-of-body experience at age one when her “consciousness started expanding” and she felt like she was “one with everything”, which prompted her passion for witchcraft. At age eight, Lilith, who is a mum of one and a grandmother of two, said she met a woman she calls Mrs Grimble, who was “only visible to (her)”, while walking in the woods. She believes the woman taught her all about witchcraft, and Lilith has identified as a witch ever since. Growing up, this made Lilith feel like the “weird one at school”, as she found it tough that no one else could identify with her experience. That was until Lilith joined her first witch group at 18, where they would practise magic together. Since then, Lilith launched her own witch group on Zoom in 2020, called The Webcoven of Untamed Witchery, and is now preparing for New Year – she plans to do a prosperity spell in the hope it will help her expand her business. The spell will involve her putting herbs such as mint, basil and bay leaves, a semi-precious stone, and a drawing of Jupiter into a bag and leaving it to charge outside in the first full moon of the year. In previous years, she has done spells which she believes have [made her able to buy a house](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/property/), and she tends to set up an altar with her wand on display and symbols of what she would like to achieve, to help reach her goals. Lilith said: “For New Year’s, I’ll write any negative feelings that I’ve experienced this year on a piece of paper, fold it up, and either burn it or bury it, then clear the space and focus on the good I want to take into next year. I’ll visualise what good I want to invite in for 2024, create a talisman around that, and do some gratitude meditation. “I will create an altar with symbols for things I want to invite in the new year, as well as a candle, a crystal, and my wand. Then I’ll celebrate with the rest of the witch group.” Lilith first got into witchcraft as a child, after having an “out of body experience” when she was one year old. “My earliest memory was from when I was one. I know this because [I was in my parents’ house](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/property/) which they had just moved into,” she said. “I was lying on my parents bed, just as babies do, and all of a sudden my consciousness started expanding. I grew into this universal consciousness space and I felt like I was one with everything, and I just felt totally loved, and connected with everything in the universe.” Lilith always remembered this memory, and as she got older, she wanted to find out what had happened and how she could make this feeling happen again. When she was eight years old, she said she became closer to understanding this experience. She explained: “I had what adults would call an imaginary friend, but to me she was absolutely real – she was a woman only visible to me. She was called Mrs Grimble, and I used to go out walking in the woods on my own, it was a different time then. “I used to meet her and take her a rock or a flower as a gift, and she lived under a big rock in these woods. She used to walk me through the woods and point out herbs, talk to me about how magic works, and talk about planets and auras and how to do spells. So, I learned a lot of my magic from her, who – according to the rest of the world – doesn’t exist. And from then on, I thought of myself as a witch.” Two years later, Lilith discovered a comic called Misty in her local corner shop, and she finally felt like she was not alone in her witch identity. “I was the weird one at school, and I remember being so happy to see Misty comic magazine,” she said. “I remember my mum being quite worried – she seemed to think it was all about dark and evil things, and didn’t really understand witchcraft very well. Eventually, I came home from school one day, and all my comics had been thrown away. It was completely devastating because that was the only thing that I had that reflected my personal experience of the world.” When Lilith was 12, she recalls Mrs Grimble telling her that she did not need her anymore, which she felt “very sad” about, but continued to study witchcraft by herself. Then, at age 18, Lilith joined her first witch group, where they practised magic together once a week. She went on to run her own groups in person, often doing large group rituals, and in 2020, she moved her group online and called it, The Webcoven of Untamed Witchery, and hosts weekly rituals and magical gatherings on Zoom. She explained: “We start off with chanting, and we talk about how we’re feeling, and each week I introduce a new practice, such as doing psychic readings, tarot or meditation. It’s a beautiful group and we have a really strong sense of community.” Lilith also does her own rituals on a day-to-day basis, she said: “I’ve got a collection of semi-precious stones and do a little ritual sitting at my altar and choose which stone resonates for me each day, what energy I need.” But, for Lilith, one of the most important times of year for her is the New Year, as she does several rituals to set up the best year possible. She explained: “It’s an important time for me because I get to consider which spells I’m going to focus on, and what my intentions are. “A few years ago, I did a lot of magic – I really needed to manifest somewhere to live – I wanted to move house and buy a house, and at that point, I had no savings. It was really powerful – over five weeks I dug down to exactly what I wanted and trained my intuition to get me there. “It involved a lot of meditation, imagining how my life would be, and doing a ritual to undo all of the negative thinking towards why it might not happen. After five weeks, I was able to buy a house, had enough saved, and found the perfect place. “But, for others, it’s important to remember that you have to manage your expectations – if other societal factors make it harder.” Lilith has now also created a e-book called The New Year Magic Spellbook to inspire other witches going into the New Year. She said: “It covers spells for new beginnings, prosperity and abundance, cleansing and protection, intention setting, gratitude, dream manifestation, love, health and wisdom.” Lilith is planning on doing her abundance and prosperity spell for 2024, with a focus on growing her business and getting more witches to join her online coven. \"I’ll get a little bag and put basil, mint and bay leaves, as well as a a semi-precious stone in there, which will be either citrine or pyrite. All of these things are known to attract an abundance of wealth and prosperity,” she explained. “I will get a small square of paper and a green pen – the green represents wealth and the square represents solidity, so I will really be solidifying my intention. I’ll draw a symbol of Jupiter on the square of paper, with the green pen, and put this into the bag along with the stone and herbs, and I’ll meditate for a while, imagining how my life will be in the next year. “On the first full moon of the year, I’ll put the bag outside and charge it with the full moon energy, and after this, I will keep it close to me, either in my handbag or under my pillow.” Looking to the future, she said: “I hope witches start to become normalised a bit. We care so much about self-care and we’re trying to help people feel more empowered, to feel like they have some control over the roller-coaster of life, and focus their energy on the things that they desire. “I think there’s so many misconceptions about us, like we’re weird, but actually we want to feel grounded in a community of like-minded people.”",

Por lo tanto, las condiciones eran realmente muy favorables.. » El índice KP sigue fuerte este viernes por la mañana: todavía hay auroras boreales en el cielo en este mismo momento, pero como es de día, no podemos verlas. largo descanso Para poder inmortalizar en fotografía la aurora polar de anoche hacía falta un poco de técnica: una cámara o un teléfono colocado sobre un soporte y un largo descanso. “Lo que vemos en las fotografías no se corresponde exactamente con lo que vimos a simple vista”, explica Benjamin Peter, que inmortalizó el fenómeno al sur de Toulouse. Varios internautas han capturado, sin embargo, bellas imágenes del fenómeno, Toulouse y en el departamento. ¿Pronto nuevas auroras polares? Este año asistimos repetidamente a fenómenos de auroras, porque el sol está experimentando una actividad especialmente fuerte. “El sol pasa por ciclos de once años”, explica Benjamin Peter. Esto significa que cada once años es muy activo y puede expulsar mucho material durante las erupciones solares. Actualmente estamos alcanzando un pico, lo que significa que todavía podemos esperar ver la aurora boreal durante aproximadamente un año. » La aplicación Mi Pronóstico de Aurora te permite seguir información en tiempo real sobre las auroras boreales y la probabilidad de verlas en el cielo.
