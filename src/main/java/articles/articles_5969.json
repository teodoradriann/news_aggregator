    "title": "A's All-Star P Mason Miller (fractured left pinky) on IL",
    "text": "The subject of trade rumors as Tuesday's deadline approaches, Oakland Athletics All-Star right-handed closer Mason Miller landed on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fracture of his left pinky finger. The move is retroactive to Tuesday. To fill Miller's spot on the 40-man roster, the A's activated right-hander Ross Stripling (elbow) to start Thursday night's series opener against the host Los Angeles Angels. Per MLB.com , Miller broke the finger while preparing to exercise in the trainers' room inside the A's clubhouse after Monday's win over the Houston Astros. The rookie placed his left hand on the training table in an awkward position, causing the injury. Miller had sealed the 4-0 victory with an 11-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth inning. Miller, 25, has five years of team control remaining after this season, but his electrifying stuff has contenders interested in obtaining his services. In 34 appearances in 2024, he is 1-1 with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves and leads all relievers with 70 strikeouts in 40 2/3 innings. Miller also leads MLB with 306 pitches at 100 mph or harder and broke the record for the fastest pitch in All-Star Game history at 103.6 mph (since pitch-tracking began in 2008). He fired a perfect inning, striking out Shohei Ohtani and Trea Tuner en route to earning the win. Since making his major league debut with Oakland last season, Miller is 1-4 with a 2.92 ERA in 44 games (six starts) with 15 saves and 108 strikeouts in 74 innings. --Field Level Media",

Log in here » TORONTO – A second condemnation of the CFL schedule has earned Edmonton Elks quarterback McLeod Bethel-Thompson another fine. The CFL announced Thursday it was penalizing Bethel-Thompson for a second violation of its code of conduct. Following Edmonton’s 20-14 loss to Ottawa on Friday, Bethel-Thompson was publicly critical of the league having both teams play on five days rest. It marked the second time this season that Bethel-Thompson has publicly criticized the league for scheduling the Elks to play games five days apart. After dropping a 39-36 decision in Toronto on June 22, Edmonton was on the short end of a 24-21 score in Vancouver to the B.C. Lions on June 27. The league also fined Edmonton defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy for delivering a high hit on Ottawa receiver Bralon Addison. As well, Winnipeg linebacker Adam Bighill was fined for unnecessary roughness after driving Saskatchewan quarterback Shea Patterson into the ground late in the Riders’ 19-9 victory. Bighill was disciplined for hitting Patterson as he rolled out to pass on the final play of the game. As per league policy, the amounts of the fines were not disclosed. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.",

    "text": "QUETTA: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir has said that armed forces and law enforcement agencies will fully support the people of Balochistan for peace and prosperity in the province as the success of Balochistan is the success of Pakistan. According to a statement issued here on Friday by Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, Gen Munir said: “The people of Pakistan are proud of the brave people of Balochistan who have stood tall against all odds”. The COAS said this during his visit to the Awaran district of Balochistan where he was briefed on the security situation of the province. Gen Munir was informed about the efforts being made by the army in the socio-economic development and agriculture potential of Balochistan. “Armed Forces of Pakistan and law-enforcement agencies will continue to render their services in support of the people of Balochistan for peace and prosperity,” the general said. During the visit, the army chief interacted with the local elders, farmers and families of martyrs and assured them of the army’s unstinting support for their security and welfare while paying rich tribute to the sacrifices rendered by martyrs. The ISPR said that while interacting with the notables and farmers of Awaran, the army chief emphasised the importance of agriculture and the army’s commitment to the Green Pakistan Initiative. “Farmers will be provided with all kinds of agricultural facilities, including provision of easy agricultural loans, seeds, fertilisers, solar tube-wells and guidance by agriculture experts so that they can cultivate their lands and become partners in the progress and development of Pakistan,” Gen Munir said. Later on, the army chief inaugurated the Cadet College of Awaran and interacted with faculty members and students. He also appreciated the establishment of another Cadet College in Balochistan for the people of the area. Published in Dawn, March 9th, 2024",

    "text": "Members of The Villages Make America Great Again Club took to the streets Sunday afternoon to show their love and support for former President Trump. More than 100 members and 70 golf carts took part in the event. The Villages MAGA Club members refer to themselves as a group of like-minded patriots showing their support for the 45th president and his America First agenda, as well as other conservative candidates at all levels of government. “We just want to help out President Trump any way we can,” said The Villages MAGA Club founder Tommy Jamieson. The enthusiastic members showed their support for Trump by driving their decked-out golf carts from Lake Sumter Landing to Eisenhower Recreation Center, where they made a brief stop. They then continued their travel to Brownwood Paddock Square, ending the trip at the City Fire restaurant. On their route, the golf carts were met by a group of protestors. During an exchange, the MAGA club members and protestors remained calm. The golf cart drivers continued to honk their horns and chant, “Trump 2024.” Villager Dorene Hengerer served 26 years in the U.S. Navy. “We need to get our country back on track, and Trump is the way to do that,” she said. The group has organized other events, such as hosting Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene in December. On Saturday, the MAGA Club hosted former West Virginia lawmaker Derrick Evans, who was arrested after the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the nation’s capitol. After speaking to the club Saturday night, Evans stuck around for Sunday’s golf cart rally. “Trump saved my life and is going to do whatever it takes to save this country; he has my full support,” Evans said.

    "title": "Liverpool 4-2 Newcastle: Salah leaves Liverpool top by three points after wild win",
    "text": "Quite a way for the\nPremier League to ring in 2024, it is fair to say. This was an evening when the rain teemed, the football flowed and the goals came in abundance. No wonder everyone was hoping for an encore at the end.\nIf the lively first half delivered everything apart from goals, then the second 45 minutes more than made up for it. Six went in — four for\nLiverpool, two for Newcastle United — but there was never the sense of any ticket-holder being shortchanged.\nLiverpool were deserved winners having managed a total of 34 shots, 15 on target, compared to the visitors’ total of five. The home team also achieved an xG (expected goals) measure of 7.27 which said much about their creativity and dominance but also failure to make it count, initially at least.\nMoving three points clear at the top of the\nPremier League certainly had Anfield rocking by the end — even if there had been some nervy moments thrown in too.\nAt the end, even\nJurgen Klopp had covered similar yardage to that of his players as he whipped up all four corners of the ground during a frenzied celebration; so much so that he even lost his wedding ring on the pitch before a steward quickly assisted him in relocating it — it was that kind of evening.\nKlopp’s in-game changes again proved inspired as two of his substitutes scored off the bench. It is a continuing theme of Liverpool’s season that the impact of replacements is significant. However, this was ultimately another occasion when\nMohamed Salah proved the true inspiration for Liverpool.\nSalah seemed to be involved in everything. He squandered a first-half penalty, scored the hosts’ opener early in the second half, played a key pass in\nCurtis Jones’s goal, provided the assist for Cody Gakpo’s and then scored from the spot to seal Liverpool’s first home league triumph in three games.\nSalah’s first goal was also his 150th in the\nPremier League and now he leaves to take part in the African Cup of Nations with Egypt for at least a month. He will be absent for two league games, possibly two FA Cup ties and the two-legged Carabao Cup semi-final against Fulham.\nThere is no doubt that Salah, in this form, will be missed but he left the supporters with a performance to remember him by here. Klopp will hope that his other forwards are able to take over the mantle.\nFor\nEddie Howe and Newcastle, they have now lost seven of their last eight games and pressure continues to grow. They face a testing January with an FA Cup tie against rivals Sunderland this weekend and two tough league matches against Manchester City and Aston Villa.\nNewcastle held their own here for spells, even if they struggled to maintain possession and relied on counter-attacks. They pegged Liverpool back at 1-1 through\nAlexander Isak but even if Sven Botman’s header to make it 3-2 induced some jeopardy back into proceedings late on, that was quickly seen to by the hosts.\nStory of the game\nIf the second half was a story of six goals, then the first period was a diary of two disallowed goals and a saved penalty.\nLuis Diaz converted Darwin Nunez’s pull-back on 17 minutes after Jones had dissected the visiting defence with a superb ball, but Nunez had not timed his run well enough and VAR eventually ruled the goal offside.\nThen, in practically the next move, Botman’s challenge brought down Diaz in the penalty area and referee\nAnthony Taylor pointed to the spot. Salah stepped forward but his penalty was straight down the middle and Martin Dubravka was able to push the ball away. Trent Alexander-Arnold sliced the rebound into the Kop.\nTen minutes before the break, it was Newcastle’s turn to be denied by\nStockley Park rulers. Lewis Miley’s cross was headed home by Dan Burn but Isak had run just offside in the build-up.\nThe other feature of the opening period was Dubravka’s saves and Nunez’s spurned chances — something that will have to change if he is to keep his place in Klopp’s starting XI. One opportunity in particular was asking to be buried but the Uruguayan sent it straight at the Newcastle ‘keeper.\nAlexander-Arnold also delivered a first-time shot from a very acute angle that kissed the top of the crossbar. Liverpool ended the half with 18 shots to Newcastle’s one. The jeers that greeted the half-time whistle, however, were directed at the referee who had tried to let the game flow but, at times, been too lenient — particularly on\nJoelinton.\nAny Liverpool frustrations disappeared three minutes into the second half. The ball was played from Alexander-Arnold to Nunez to\nDominik Szoboszlai to Diaz and back to Nunez who eschewed the chance to shoot and instead laid the ball across the goal to Salah who tapped-in for his 150th league goal.\nDubravka continued to have the upper-hand over Nunez with two fine stops and Newcastle were thankful for them when, in the 54th minute,\nAnthony Gordon threaded a pass through to Isak and the Sweden international outstripped Virgil van Dijk and placed a precise shot beyond Alisson.\nThe Newcastle ‘keeper kept his side in the contest with more saves to deny Salah and then Gakpo. But Liverpool’s pressure duly told as Salah played a delightful reverse pass to substitute\nDiogo Jota and his low centre was met first time by Jones at the back post.\nIf relief greeted that goal, then joy succeeded Liverpool’s third. Salah was again involved, this time playing a fine pass into the penalty area with the outside of his left boot and Gakpo kindly accepted the offer and prodded home.\nNewcastle were not done yet though. Three minutes later, a corner was swung in and Botman rose highest to plant a powerful header into the Liverpool net. The travelling supporters roared their side on but any chance of a comeback was quickly put to bed.\nAlexis Mac Allister, back after a leg injury, played in Jota, who rounded Dubravka before going down with a delayed fall. Contact may have been minimal but a penalty was given and checked by VAR. Salah made no mistake this time, burying it in the back of the net to send Liverpool three points clear.\nPlayer of the game:\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/11/12/premier-league/1162732-liverpool-3-0-brentford-salah-and-jota-brilliance-lofts-reds-to-sexonf.html\nSalah signed off for Liverpool duty for at least the next month with an inspired display that led his team three points clear at the top of the table.\nThe Egpyt international will now go to\nIvory Coast for the African Cup of Nations but left a lasting mark as he scored twice and was involved in Liverpool's two other goals against Newcastle.",

Comme celui d’autres grandes villes, la capitale est plus confrontée aux particules fines, issues de la combustion du bois mais aussi, bien sûr, de la circulation automobile. En ce qui concerne le chauffage au bois et aux pellets, Bruxelles Environnement détaille sur son site les nouvelles règles entrées en vigueur le 1er janvier 2025.\n> Le placement des appareils d’occasion n’est plus autorisé.\n> Les émissions de particules des appareils doivent être inférieures ou égales à 20 mg de particules par m³ à 13 % d’O.\n> La vérification du respect de cette exigence se fait sur base du label énergétique sur l’étiquette ou la fiche technique.\n> Les chaudières aux combustibles solides (bois et pellets) devront faire l’objet d’un contrôle PEB annuel.\n> Les cheminées des chaudières et appareils de chauffage local aux combustibles solides doivent être vérifiées et ramonées chaque année.\nUn certain nombre d’exigences de bon fonctionnement sont également formulées. En voici quelques-unes :\n> Les fumées ne peuvent être visibles et/ou odorantes (sauf s’il s’agit de vapeur d’eau).\n> Si un appareil prélève l’air nécessaire pour la combustion dans le local où il se trouve, il faut prévoir un dispositif qui garantit un renouvellement de l’air de ce local.\n> La teneur en CO dans l’air ambiant du local ne peut en aucun cas dépasser 25 ppm afin d’éviter les risques d’intoxication au monoxyde de carbone.\nContenus sponsorisés\nCommentaires\nVous souhaitez interagir sur cet article ?\nConnectez-vous et publiez votre commentaire.\nSe connecter\nPas encore de compte ?

    "text": "Sen. Blaise Ingoglia. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix) End-to-end encryption has made crimes against minors significantly harder to prosecute, legal experts say. Florida lawmakers plan to make social media companies cooperate with those investigations. The Sen. Blaise Ingoglia-introduced SB 868 is headed to the Senate floor after passing the Rules Committee Wednesday. Social media companies offering encrypted messaging are in opposition to the bill while state attorneys came to Tallahassee hoping the Legislature would make their jobs easier. Encrypted messages, those designed only to be read by the sender and receiver, not the owners of the platform it was sent on, are designed to prevent hackers or others acting in bad faith from accessing personal messages. Since end-to-end encryption has become widely-used, Ingoglia said, social media companies have told prosecutors they have no records to provide toward convicting “nefarious” actors in child pornography and drug trafficking cases. “As you know, there are extremely bad actors online targeting minors with sexually explicit and sexually suggestive materials,” Ingoglia said. “Encryption, used by social media companies, makes it more challenging if not impossible for law enforcement to retrieve the proof necessary to put these guys behind bars.” The bill would require social media companies to de-crypt messages if subpoenaed by a court and prohibit minors from using messages that are designed to disappear. Popular apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption. NetChoice, a tech association representing some of the largest social platforms, contest the bill, saying it is “well intentioned” but “fundamentally undermines the core purpose of encryption.” “Creating an encryption backdoor is fraught with privacy and security risks,” NetChoice stated on its website. Rep. Michelle Salzman is sponsor of the House version, HB 743 , which must pass the Commerce Committee before receiving a floor vote. “I shared with all the social media companies that came to see me that we are going to put the safety of Floridians first and them second, and either they can get on board and look good or they can just stand there and fight and lose,” Salzman told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’re not going to stop here. This bill will pass this year and we’re going to continue the momentum.” This bill is another in lawmakers’ effort to protect minors online. Minors younger than 14-years-old will be prohibited from using social media if the state successfully defends its 2024 law that also requires parental consent for 14-and-15-year-olds to use social media platforms with addictive features. NetChoice filed suit against the state on that 2024 law, HB 3. “So, just think if you were a parent, and you know that your child is being groomed by somebody online, and the child is now being pressured to give nude photos or create child pornography for the purpose of transmitting over,” Ingoglia said. “And you went to a state’s attorney or a prosecutor and they tried and they gave the subpoena or the warrant and the social media came back and they said, ‘Hey we have nothing.’” Ingoglia said he does not think social media companies are behaving in good faith. “Under any other section of law when it comes to prosecuting, somebody who destroys evidence will be put away,” Ingoglia said. “But social media companies though their algorithms and through their coding are allowed to destroy evidence all the time.” State Attorney Amira Fox, prosecuting in Charlotte, Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties, stood beside Salzman and Ingoglia Wednesday in hopes the bill will pass. “Social media platforms have made it very difficult for prosecutors,” Fox said, adding that end-to-end encryption has attracted people who want to use it for illegal purposes. Fox said compared to the beginning of her career, social media have boosted the number of cases involving child predators. “We have spent years putting together task forces to tackle human trafficking and child abuse, and now we’re met with, when we send our subpoenas and our search warrants to these social media companies … we get back ‘no material exists,’ because they’ve encrypted it,” Fox said during a news conference Wednseday afternoon at the Capitol. Fox said the lawmakers’ bill is a “great bill to stand up to this.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",
