    "title": "Vance accused Walz of 'stolen valor.' What to know about Walz’s military record | KPBS Public Media",
    "text": "For more on the 2024 race, head to the NPR Network's elections updates page. Late Tuesday afternoon, the Harris campaign released a video of Tim Walz talking about gun control. Walz, whom Kamala Harris recently announced as her running mate, talks about banning assault rifles as part of what he calls “common sense” proposals. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in the video. That was all Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance needed. “Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this?” Vance said. The vice presidential candidate is supposed to be an attack dog, sometimes landing the lower blows that might seem unpresidential. But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their service shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn’t seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz’s phrasing opened up a line of attack — and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles. War, combat and service – and a charge of “stolen valor” Walz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan. So Vance, and many veterans on social media, took issue with Walz saying he’d carried weapons “in war.” The Harris campaign said in a statement: “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\" But Vance went a lot further, with an attack that the Trump campaign probably had prepared. “What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said. Since Walz first ran for Congress and then governor, he’s faced attacks around the timing of his retirement. Vance’s accusation echoes one made by two fellow high-ranking sergeants from the Minnesota Guard who publicly attacked Walz in 2018, in a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune. They slammed Walz for “conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.” According to the Minnesota National Guard, Walz retired in May 2005, two months before his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in July 2005. It’s likely that Walz put in for retirement months before that May. It’s also clear that guardsmen anticipated deployment to Iraq months before July. According to several of his contemporaries in the guard Walz talked about it as a hard decision: that if he deployed he’d miss his best chance to run for Congress. “He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,” Allan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. “He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn’t take that decision lightly at all.” The unit didn’t go to Iraq until March 2006, 10 months after Walz retired, where it stayed for a grueling 22-month extended deployment. The charge has dogged Walz, and in his last run for governor in 2022, it was even leveled by a political opponent who never served at all. Walz’s rank The latest round of attacks on Walz stirred up another confusing point about his rank. Walz served as a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. But his retirement papers put him one step lower – a master sergeant. The Minnesota National Guard told NPR that Walz retired before completing academic requirements to keep the higher rank. “He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,” said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, the Minnesota National Guard’s state public affairs officer. So while Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major, which also made him the highest enlisted member serving in Congress, and he can even get away with saying he retired as a command sergeant major, he cannot say he is a “retired command sergeant major.” On Thursday the Harris campaign changed Walz’s official bio on their website to reflect that. Charges of “swiftboating” Attacking an opponent’s military service has a short history in presidential campaigns – the verb “swiftboat” dates back only 20 years, when George W. Bush’s campaign attacked combat-decorated John Kerry’s military service in Vietnam, which might have seemed risky since Bush avoided serving there. Donald Trump, who also avoided going to Vietnam, took the tactic to another level, attacking his GOP critic John McCain’s storied status as a POW. Now, Harris supporters are claiming that Vance is trying to “swiftboat” Walz, and even pointing to a member of the Bush-era campaign who is now working for Trump . Veterans groups are generally keeping out of the fray; many veterans service organizations are on record praising the choice of two enlisted military veterans as vice-presidential nominees. “This means that regardless of the outcome in November, the next vice president of the United States will be a former enlisted service member. I am pleased to see both major parties recognize that military service is once again a valued experience in choosing the candidate for the second highest position in the country,” Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Al Lipphardt said in a statement.

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link) Le Japon a connu cette année son mois de juillet le plus chaud depuis la mise en place de statistiques comparables il y a 126 ans Le Japon a connu cette année son mois de juillet le plus chaud depuis la mise en place de statistiques comparables il y a 126 ans, a annoncé l'agence météorologique nippone. Les températures dans le pays ont été supérieures de 2,16 degrés Celsius à la moyenne, battant le record de juillet 2023, qui était de 1,91°C au-dessus de la moyenne. \"Il s'agit du chiffre le plus élevé depuis le début des statistiques en 1898\", a déclaré jeudi l'Agence météorologique japonaise (JMA), précisant que les relevés étaient \"considérablement plus élevés\" dans l'ensemble du pays. Sur 153 postes d'observation au Japon, 62 ont battu leur record de température moyenne en juillet. Un système de haute pression au-dessus de l'océan Pacifique et \"l'air chaud du sud\" qui a enveloppé les parties septentrionales de l'archipel ont contribué à cette situation, a précisé la JMA. Depuis avril, 59 personnes sont mortes des suites de coups de chaleur au Japon, selon l'agence de gestion des catastrophes. Ombrelles et colliers refroidissants sont devenus courants dans les rues, notamment à Tokyo, où Jiro Kan, un artiste de rue de 56 ans a été interviewé par l'AFP dans le quartier touristique d'Asakusa. \"Après avoir passé deux heures debout ici, je suis tellement en sueur que je peux littéralement essorer ma chemise. Je suis trempé\", a-t-il dit. \"Les personnes habituées à une chaleur plus sèche, comme aux États-Unis, trouvent la chaleur et l'humidité du Japon plus difficiles à supporter\", a-t-il ajouté Le mois dernier, le département de Shizuoka, au sud-ouest de Tokyo, a été le premier au Japon à voir le mercure atteindre 40°C cette année, dépassant de loin le seuil de 35°C correspondant à la définition d'une journée \"extrêmement chaude\" par les autorités météorologiques. Les vagues de chaleur sont de plus en plus fréquentes dans le monde entier, le dimanche 21 juillet ayant été la journée la plus chaude enregistrée dans l'histoire selon le réseau européen Copernicus.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "A tank museum in England is helping Ukrainians in the fight against Russia.\nHome to over 300 tanks from 26 countries, The Tank Museum in Bovington possesses an archive of manuals, diagrams, and documents on repairing Soviet-era tanks and armor damaged while battling for Ukraine.\nUsing these archives and its track specimens, The Tank Museum has been working with County Durham-based Cook Defense Systems to produce replacement tracks and drive sprockets..\nThe initiative began after Cook Defence received an urgent request from the UK’s Ministry of Defence. Cook Defense turned to the Museum for support.\nCurator David Willey said in a statement that “the Tank Museum’s collections are used for many purposes. When we can help industry and our allies, of course we should. We are very pleased to hear the reproduced track is now arriving in Ukraine.”\nCook Defense declined to comment when approached by Business Insider.\nUkraine’s tank fleet\nWhile Ukraine has been supplied with tanks from its Western allies\n, including the Leopard 2 from Germany, the Challenger 2 from the UK, and the M1 Abrams from the US. However, much of the country’s fleet consists of Soviet-era tanks and armored vehicles from the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe MT-LB, the BMP-1, and the main Soviet battle tank, the T-72, are widely used on the battlefield. Given their age, the tracks of many of these tanks have been damaged by mines. Ukraine lacks the personnel and resources to repair them.\nCook Defense has had to reverse-engineer the design of these weapons to understand how they were built. Cook Defence has a history of supplying tracks for armored fighting vehicles for the British Army and allies.\nThe Tank Museum is a surprise hit on social media\nNor is this the first time that the museum has used its expertise to help out modern-day armies.\nIn 2011, before the British Royal Air Force’s bombing campaign in Libya, the Tank Museum allowed RAF Tornado jet pilots to fly over T-54s and T-72s — tanks that the Libyan army used — to get accustomed to how they looked from the air.\nIn 2010,\nthe museum launched a YouTube channel, which has since amassed over 700,000 subscribers. In the “Tank Chats” series, museum experts explain to viewers how different fighting vehicles function and how they are or were used on the battlefield.\nThe Tank Museum is close to the British Army’s Bovington Garrison where it trains all soldiers destined for regiments equipped with armoured vehicles.\nThe Tank Museum is close to the British Army’s Bovington Garrison where the UK trains all soldiers destined for regiments equipped with armoured vehicles.\nSince Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian soldiers have received training at Bovington, taught how to operate the Challenger 2 tank.\nIn February 2023, along with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was shown around Lulworth Camp, part of the Bovington Garrison.\nThe post\nHow a British tank museum is helping Ukraine to repair its Soviet-era armor appeared first on Business Insider.",

    "text": "Alors que le bilan des inondations est passé à 205 morts, l'Espagne craint de nouvelles pluies torrentielles L'envoi de ces soldats, annoncé jeudi soir par le gouvernement central, fait suite à une demande pressante du président de la région de Valence, Carlos Mazón, dont le gouvernement est débordé par cette crise sans précédent, Ces renforts portent à 1700 le nombre de militaires déployés dans la région de Valence, de loin la plus endeuillée par les inondations, avec 202 des 205 décès enregistrés. Deux autres décès ont également eu lieu dans la région voisine de Castille-La Manche et un en Andalousie. L'armée a pour priorité de rouvrir les routes pour permettre l'acheminement de l'aide, notamment alimentaire, mais aussi d'aider à la recherche des personnes portées disparues, dont le nombre exact n'est pas connu, mais est très élevé. De maison en maison A Utiel, des agriculteurs travaillent sans relâche, à l'aide de tracteurs, pour enlever la boue, retirer les objets drainés par les eaux, mais aussi les meubles des maisons inondées. Ce large élan de solidarité est porté notamment par les réseaux sociaux. \"Nous allons de maison en maison en demandant si les gens ont besoin d'aide\", explique une habitante de 26 ans. \"Certains ont tout perdu, il y a des personnes âgées de 90 ans qui vivent seules\", détaille-t-elle. Dans la ville, située à moins de cent kilomètres de Valence, l'électricité n'est pas encore rétablie partout. L'eau potable reste coupée ou fortement restreinte, comme dans une vingtaine de communes sinistrées. Une incompréhension des enjeux? Alors que le dérèglement climatique est avancé comme première cause de cette catastrophe, le directeur de l'Institut de l'adaptation humaine, à Marseille, considère vendredi dans La Matinale que les pays européens n'ont pas \"compris l'enjeu\". Selon Christian Clot, \"il ne suffira pas de changer nos infrastructures et nos systèmes techniques\". Pour éviter les inondations, dont la fréquence va encore augmenter, il sera nécessaire \"d'occuper l'espace différemment, de revégétaliser et de débétonner nos systèmes\" pour permettre une meilleure absorption par les sols, explique le chercheur franco-suisse.
