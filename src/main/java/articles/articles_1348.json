    "text": "Susan G Komenon Thu, 02/20/2025 - 14:27\nDALLAS – Susan G. Komen ® , the world’s leading breast cancer organization, today raised concerns over new data showing that Black women in the U.S. continue to die at disproportionately higher rates from breast cancer, underscoring the urgent need for change. Among Black women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and is a leading cause of cancer death for Black women.\nBlack Women Are More Likely Than White Women to Die of Breast Cancer\nDALLAS – Susan G. Komen ® , the world’s leading breast cancer organization, today raised concerns over new data showing that Black women in the U.S. continue to die at disproportionately higher rates from breast cancer, underscoring the urgent need for change. Among Black women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and is a leading cause of cancer death for Black women.\nData from the American Cancer Society highlights a critical crisis: Despite overall lower breast cancer incidence rates, Black women face a nearly 40% higher mortality rate compared to white women—a stark disparity driven not only by biology, but by systemic inequities in health care, quality of care and social determinants of health.\n“Black women are dying at higher rates than white women because systemic failures affect them at every stage of their breast cancer care,” said Paula Schneider, president and CEO of Susan G. Komen. “However, solutions do exist to improve quality of care, remove barriers to access, reduce costs and address inequities and bias that drive disparities in outcomes. We must unite to create a health equity movement that saves lives.”\nDespite advancements in breast cancer detection and treatment, Black women are unable to access and afford the care they need. They are also less likely to receive imaging at facilities with the latest technology, and more likely to experience delays in follow-up care after a screening mammogram reveals and abnormality. A study found that Black women face treatment delays at every stage, from diagnosis to completion. These disparities are compounded by rising out-of-pocket costs for follow-up care, which have increased by 8% from 2018 to 2023, further limiting access to timely, life-saving treatment.\n“True health equity means equal access to care for everyone, everywhere,” said Molly Guthrie, Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at Susan G. Komen. “While we’ve made progress in breast cancer outcomes, the mission isn’t finished. We need critical policy changes to drive the reforms needed to save lives. One immediate opportunity is to address the financial barriers people face in receiving the breast imaging they require to complete the early detection and diagnosis process. We’ve seen legislation enacted in many states, but federal action is needed to ensure this barrier is removed for everyone across the country.”\nKomen is committed to advancing breast health equity through targeted initiatives, advocacy, research and direct support for Black women facing breast cancer. In addition to its advocacy work, Komen is tackling the issue on multiple fronts, including through its ShareForCures ® initiative. In the U.S., fewer than 10% of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials, and less than 10% of those are from historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups. ShareForCures ® aims to accelerate research breakthroughs that will benefit all by connecting patients through a groundbreaking research registry.\nKomen also launched Stand for H.E.R. – A Health Equity Revolution in 2021, designed to break down barriers and improve access to high-quality breast care for Black women across the U.S. through five key drivers of change: Education, patient support, workforce development, research and policy creation.\nTo learn more about Komen’s efforts to close the racial gap in breast cancer outcomes, visit https://www.komen.org/about-komen/our-impact/breast-cancer/health-equities-initiative/",

Zelensky confirmed the call, during which he congratulated Trump on formally becoming the Republican Party's presidential nominee, as well as wishing the 78-year-old well after an attempt on his life a week ago. \"We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting,\" Zelensky said in a post on X.

[Kim Kardashian's woven braids spark Founding Father comparisons](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/25/Kim-Kardashian/3021224) Kim Kardashian’s latest hairstyle has seemingly taken inspiration from America’s Founding Fathers, according to fans. The Skims founder, 43, took to Instagram on June 23 to debut a new look. In a carousel of photos, Kardashian’s platinum blonde hair was woven into basket braid pigtails. The reality TV star went makeup free in the photos, pairing her braided hairstyle with a sheer tank top and nude leggings, [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kim-kardashian-woven-braids-hair-b2568077.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3svvdDOZf2TnZs7SwpQykx_WXkigLPer4h9t4c-jqIqI4PmoKLbaP4kIM_aem_A-BbF_EhZDf3E_jI3vu7tw#Echobox=1719291424) reported. While the Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum has been known to wear some avante-garde and futuristic ensembles, some fans believed her newest look resembled a powdered wig from the 18th century. “What in the constitution is going on here?” one Instagram user commented under the post. “Ok George Washington,” another fan joked. “It’s giving… Founding Father,” said someone else, while another person quipped: “She getting ready to write the Declaration of Independence.” Kardashian’s woven braids were crafted by her longtime hairstylist Chris Appleton, who she tagged in her Instagram post. Appleton posted photos of the entrepreneur’s basket braids to his own Instagram, simply captioning his post with three silver chain link emojis. This isn’t the first time the mother of four has shocked fans with a dramatic hair transformation. In 2015, Kardashian debuted her now-signature bleach blonde hair for the first time at Paris Fashion Week. The Kardashians star went back to her natural dark brown locks on-and-off for several years, before undergoing a 14-hour hair transformation to channel Marilyn Monroe at the 2022 Met Gala. [Kim Kardashian admits she hid in bathroom to escape her sreaming kids](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/06/Kim-Kardashian/3012868) Kim Kardashian has revealed she was forced to lock herself in a bathroom to escape the wrath of her four kids, [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kim-kardashian-forced-hide-bathroom-32971474) reports. Kim shares her offspring with ex-husband Kanye West. She’s a doting mum to North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and Psalm, five. In new scenes from her Disney+ show The Kardashians, the 43-year-old Skims founder admitted she “couldn’t believe” the way her kids were behaving. Sitting in a car while on the way to jury duty, Kim was seen chatting on the phone to an unnamed friend when she began to vent about her children, confessing she was a “push over” when it came to her kids. “Hey can I vent for one sec? It’s been an extra troubling week where I was just like I can’t do it anymore,” Kim began, adding: “I just… anything in that home is just chaotic right now. Oh my God, no, what I wanted to say was I had a Zoom at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming, and I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked as I was just like, I can’t believe this. I mean I can believe it, but that’s like my biggest nightmare.” Elaborating on her parenting techniques in a confessional, Kim told cameras: “Sometimes it gets, just like a little intense. I want to be more strict like Khloe but I don’t know why I have a hard time just saying no is no. I think I also just don’t want to deal with the whining and the tears of not getting their way.” “They know when to con me and when to throw the little, you know, start with the tears so I’m like, ‘Stop, stop, sure, take an iPad,’ you know, just stop. I just have to be like, ‘I don’t care if you’re gonna throw a tantrum in front of everyone right now. The answer is no’,” Kim noted. Kim’s family drama comes after she showcased her dramatic weight loss as she slipped into one of Janet Jackson's iconic outfits. The reality star-turned-lawyer purchased Janet's outfit from the iconic 1993 music video for her single, If, three years ago at an auction. Kim spent a whopping $25,000 (£19,571) on the costume back in 2021, explaining she was \"such a fan\". At the time, Kim took to her Instagram Stories saying: \"For @janetjackson's bday bc I'm such a fan I can't believe I won this on juliens_auctions. Happy birthday queen!\" [EUMA welcomes visitors from Dutch Police](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/04/EUMA/3011796) The EU Mission in Armenia (EUMA) on Monday welcomed the Dutch Police delegation. “Happy to welcome visitors from the Dutch Police today in Yeghegnadzor.

    "title": "8 Best Dive Watches For Men – Reliable + Well Built For 2023",
    "text": "Is the dive watch, de facto, the best\nwatch style? It’s versatile, rugged, reliable, practical, stylish, has heritage, and is home to some of the most killer timepieces available. It’s no surprise that it’s the most popular style of watch. (Even Gucci is in on the act, now.) We’re here to cut through the radiowaves and select only the best dive watches for you.\nThe dive watch is arguably the most versatile. Is it the only watch you’d ever need to own? Its vintage roots give it verve and sophistication to pair well with tailoring and black tie, but its inherent ruggedness and simplicity make it perfect for everyday wear too. Plus, the bezel is a supremely practical tool. It acts as a useful timer, and\ncompass, and even can show a second timezone. Owning a dive watch is critical to building a worthy watch collection.\nWe’ve compiled the eight best dive watches for every budget, style, and inclination. Read on below.\nKey Takeaways\nThis deep dive into the best dive watches took me through some murky parts of the internet. It opened my eyes to rare species of YouTube videos and I found coves of HTML filled with dive watches. Sadly, I couldn’t choose more and had to stop at just 8 pieces.\nOverall, the best dive watch is the\nDOXA SUB 600T. I love the idiosyncratic 80s case, the orange dial, and its 600m water resistance. My second choice goes to Blancpain’s Fifty Fathoms Automatique. It’s one-two punch of being the first watch in 1953 to feature the now ubiquitous uni-directional bezel combined with its exquisite luxuriousness, makes this an irresistible choice.\nBest Overall: Doxa SUB 600T\nWhy it’s great: DOXA (est. 1889) is a brand of diving heritage. In 1967, it added “no-decompression times” to the bezel, further enhancing the practicality of dive watches. The 600T is a rarer choice than its SUB 200, SUB 300T (which had direct input from the French King of Diving himself, Jacques Cousteau), or even SUB 1500T cousins. But it has that vibrant, popping orange dial that DOXA has become synonymous with. This brings a real collector’s “IFYKYK” edge to it.\nHow it looks: The 600T was released in the 80s and so has a little vintage panache streaking through its pedigree. You can see that in the extra bracelet edge around the outer edge of the bezel. This gives it a masculine rugged feel that’d lure city-dwellers and deep-sea divers alike.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: That bright orange dial isn’t going to be for everyone. Thankfully, DOXA does the model in black, stainless steel, blue, and yellow versions too.\nCase Size: 40mm | Movement: Automatic | Thickness: 14.15mm | Material: Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 600m\nBest Microbrand: Baltic Watches Aquascaphe\nWhy it’s great: Everything about this watch is micro. It is a micro brand, named after a micro sea, making a diving watch that’s only 39mm in diameter. For a style renowned for its bulky size, this is a micro dive watch. A large case can come across as arrogant and tasteless, so the French brand is\nopting for a smaller case size. There’s a dual-crown version too in case that tickles your pickles.\nHow it looks: The double dome sapphire gives it a sleek old-school appeal. For this reason, this watch could spend its whole life paired with various impeccable loose-fitted suits sauntering around various European metropoles, rather than diving for rare species of fish. Less scuba-diving, more thrift-shop-diving.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: Perhaps a little twee and antique looking for the more machismo men out there.\nCase Size: 39mm | Movement: Automatic Miyota 9039 | Thickness: 13mm | Material: Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 200m\nBest Budget: Casio MDV106-1AV\nWhy it’s great: Casio watches are known for their\ntough as beef jerky digital watches. But not for their diving capabilities. So, there are several reasons as to why this dive watch from Casio is surprisingly good. The classic stainless steel dial paired with the modern wavy resin strap is a fusion of luxury and sporty. Plus, the watch comes with diving capabilities: 200m waterproof, rotating bezel, screw-down crown, and a small date display at 3:00. Lastly, we can’t ignore its Casio-like price tag. We hate to admit it, but this is a really good purchase.\nHow it looks: Its conventional and sleek black design means it has the versatility of use. It could be an everyday wear, smart-casual champion, or a humble diver’s companion.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: When you’re comparing watches that have a price variability of 1000x difference, corners are inevitably cut at the lower end of that spectrum. Be realistic with this watch’s ability to last a lifetime.\nCase Size: 44.2mm | Movement: Quartz (SR626SW) | Thickness: 12.1mm | Material: Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 200m\nBest On Amazon: Vaer DS4 Meridian Solar Dive Watch\nWhy it’s great: This is the best watch for if you fear societal collapse. The solar-powered quartz movement can be powered purely by the light emanating from the lick of a candle alone; it’s that sensitive. And from just 6 hours of direct sunlight, it will charge a reserve battery for six months. So even if the nuclear winter blocks out sunlight for a while, you’ll be all good. Dark humor aside, this is one of the best men’s dive watches on the market. It is made in Japan and comes with scratch-resistant AR (anti-reflective) coated sapphire crystal plus a surgical-grade steel (316L) frame. If that wasn’t enough, the brand is a “1% for the planet” member.\nHow it looks: This Vaer DS4 watch has a beautiful and classical dive/military look that can be tweaked by interchanging the two straps that come as standard. This is for the rugged outdoorsman, be it hiking for weeks into the mountains, or diving around the coral reef.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: Its conventional masculine aesthetic is somewhat predictable in the current climate. But, that’s not necessarily a bad thing; it will please a lot of people. It also lacks individual minute dials on the first 15 minutes. This is quite useful for a dive watch to feature.\nCase Size: 38 or 42mm | Movement: solar-powered quartz | Thickness: 10.6mm | Material: (316L) Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 200m\nBest Everyday: Seiko PROSPEX SRPE37\nWhy it’s great: Seiko has an official association with PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors). The “Prospex” model by Seiko proves diving watches used for diving aren’t obsolete at all. The name is a portmanteau of “professional specifications” and them aplenty. It comes with clear luminescent hands and markers, a magnified date window, single-minute intervals around the whole bezel, and a robust waved strap to soak up impact. “Prospex” indeed.\nHow it looks: I think this is a brilliant general adventure watch. Style this with a pair of indigo jeans, a white t-shirt, a Belstaff jacket, and a grunting Harley Davidson for maximum effect.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: The shock-absorbing strap subtracts a little formality from the overall look.\nCase Size: 44mm | Movement: Automatic | Thickness: 12.81mm | Material: Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 200m\nBest Luxury: Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Automatique\nWhy it’s great: 2023 marks the 70th anniversary of Blancpain Fifty Fathoms. In 1953, Jean-Jacques Fiechter introduced the first uni-directional bezel dive watch. If the bezel got knocked accidentally, it could only move in one direction. The direction only lengthened the perceived time for the diver. That way, the diver would begin the ascent “early” and the oxygen wouldn’t run out. This was a revolutionary safety feature. Once Blancpain’s patent ran out all watch brands adopted this style of bezel. But, if you think this brand is resting on its laurels, check out this\nBlancpain x Swatch collab released in 2023.\nHow it looks: Its heritage gives it an authentic,\nvintage aesthetic. The large 45mm titanium case, sapphire crystal, and in-house automatic movement bring luxury. The combination of these two qualities makes this Blancpain a fantastic dress watch and a chic talking point at dinner.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: While its heritage makes this Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Automatique the dive watch to own, your bank account must also be 300m deep and stretch the full width of the Pacific Ocean. Also, with a case size of 45mm and a thickness of 15mm, it’s a ChunkyBoi.\nCase Size: 45mm | Movement: Automatic Caliber 1315 | Thickness: 15.0mm | Material: Titanium | Water Resistance: 300m\nBest Chronograph: Tissot SEASTAR 1000 CHRONOGRAPH\nWhy it’s great: The\nchronograph capabilities of this Tissot Seastar 1000 give it extra timing functions. A diver could use the various chronograph functions to time multiple things at once. If that didn’t indicate that this watch wasn’t serious enough, it also has Superluminova lighting, 300m water depth, and it has a helium valve release (read below on what that is). It has incredible functionality. But, it’s the beauty of the object that brings this model to the article on the best men’s dive watches.\nHow it looks: The light gray and orange combination is one I love on a watch and the “seastar” seahorse engraving on the back is a lovely flourish. Though extremely functional, I find this an extremely alluring and stylish object. Well played Tissot.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: The chronograph functions might over-complicate the dial for some. Plus, the 45.5mm case size is large.\nCase Size: 45.5mm | Movement: Automatic | Thickness: 14.15mm | Material: Stainless Steel 316L | Water Resistance: 300m\nBest Large: TAG Heuer Stainless Steel Aquaracer 43mm\nWhy it’s great: The TAG Heuer Aquaracer range is a young one for such a heritage brand. It has a very recognizable dodecagon (twelve-sided) case shape in stainless steel. This design is strong, but the rounded edges give it an important approachability. The quartz movement, 300m water resistance, and AR sapphire crystal make this a dependable timepiece. The expandable bracelet isn’t the sexiest feature, but it is important for wearing with a wetsuit.\nHow it looks: If you are a man who loves having lots of information blasted at you, then you will love this watch.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers: It’s one of the lesser-known dive watches despite hailing from a famous brand. This gives it allure.\nCase Size: 43mm | Movement: Quartz | Thickness: 14.15mm | Material: Stainless Steel | Water Resistance: 300m\nBuying Considerations for Men’s Dive Watches\nBezel\nThis is one of the key parts of a dive watch. It works when the diver sets the top mark of the bezel to the time on the minute hand of the watch. Then, as time passes, the minute hand moves and the bezel reading indicates the amount of time passed. This helps divers time various stops, working out when to begin resurfacing, and to help time various decompression stops.\nIf you’re operating the watch in cold waters you will want a bezel that is easy to operate. Cold fingers and potentially neoprene gloves will make dexterity more challenging. Avoid bezels operated via crowns for this reason. A brand would house a bezel inside the case and operate via a crown to mitigate the risk of knocking the bezel. The crowns then make the watch bulkier, but it does give a different aesthetic and a point of difference. The\nSeiko Divemaster 1000 (known colloquially as “Tuna” for its bulk and circularity) put a bulky external shroud over the bezel to protect it from accidental knocks.\nMaterial\nTitanium is lightweight, hypoallergenic, highly corrosion resistant, and is fine in extreme temperatures. Stainless Steel (316L) is standard practice these days for its almost perfect suitability for watch casing. It can’t withstand the same intensity as titanium, but for the average scuba diver, it’ll do just fine. Sapphire Crystal revolutionized the watch industry. It is made by crystallizing aluminum oxide. The result is a material far superior in strength to glass.\nMovement\nAny movement is equally valid but just has different strengths and weaknesses. The ISO 6425 states that if battery powered, it must have a low battery indicator as a necessity for obvious reasons. A Quartz movement is slimmer, more accurate, and lightweight, but does eventually run out of battery. An automatic\nmechanical movement is extremely long-lasting, automatically winding, a feat of engineering, but can be chunky. A manual dive watch is rare (or even non-existent?) due to inherent reliability issues.\nWhy you should trust us\nI’m a fashion and watch writer at FashionBeans. I clothe myself daily in the latest products, Instagram posts, and URLs of the fashion/watch industry. I also consider myself very lucky to own a small but eclectic watch collection. For this review, I got my dive watches out and inspected them with new knowledge from the Internet. I found fascinating histories, and unique features, and focussed on the most important watch models/brands. I began with what seemed like an endless list of contenders and chopped it down to just the top 8 of the best men’s dive watches you see above.\nFinal Verdict\nThe\nDOXA SUB 600T is the best overall dive watch. I picked this watch for its inimitable 80s style and charm. It has a robust, angular stainless steel aesthetic that is dripping with vintage panache. Then there’s the bright orange dial and the depth readings on the bezel, but moreover, it has an impressive 600m water resistance. You know it’s tough.\n-\n- Why are dive watches so popular?\nThe best dive watches are the most versatile type of watches. They are designed to withstand deep depths submerged in water. This makes them comfortable withstanding the trials and tribulations of everyday modern life. Also, they have a heritage. The first dive watches were launched in 1953. This gives the style of the modern dive watch a vintage DNA and origin which is still referenced today. This also means that the less outrageous-looking diving watches can even be used as dress watches. Also, the bezel is a practical and ergonomic gizmo to have on your wrist. It can be used for timing anything, using it as a compass, and as a reminder of time zones. Why are diving watches so popular? They are stylish, extremely robust, versatile, and highly practical for everyday use.\n- Why do dive watches have rotating bezels?\nThe rotating bezel acts as a clear timer underwater. Simply set the bezel to the minute hand. This essentially starts the timer. You can read off the bezel for the length of time. Underwater you might need to time the descent time, the bottom time (time spent at the bottom of your dive), or decompression times. However, this timer function can be used for whatever purpose the wearer sees fit.\n- How do dive watches work?\nA dive watch is all about giving its diver clear and precise time readings underwater. It must be able to resist water entering its frame. It does so by using water-resistant gaskets and a sturdy frame. It must be able to track time elapsed. It does so via the rotating bezel. The diver must be able to read this information in sometimes darkness and murky water. The clear, luminous hands and markers assist with this.\n- What is a helium escape valve and do you need one?\nHelium atoms are the smallest natural gas particles. They are small enough to squeeze through a watch’s waterproof seals under pressure. When the watch returns to normal pressure, the atoms return to normal size, increasing the pressure inside the watch. This can destroy a watch from the inside out by either damaging the movement or even the crystal can pop off. Do you need one? Unless you are a saturation diver, then no, you technically don’t need one.\n-",

    "text": "[](/tenis/us-open/alcaraz-irreconocible-amargura-nueva-york-20240830080417-nt.html) Batacazo de Alcaraz ante Van de Zandschulp en el US Open El tenista español pierde contra el número 74 del mundo y cae eliminado en la segunda ronda en Nueva York. El tenista español [Carlos Alcaraz](https://www.relevo.com/tenis/tenistas/carlos-alcaraz/) perdió en tres sets de forma inapelable ante el neerlandés Van de Zandschulp por 6-1, 7-5 y 6-4 en dos horas y 19 minutos. Campeón de Roland Garros y Wimbledon este año, además de haber ganado la plata en París 2024, Alcaraz, número 3 de la ATP, no sufría una derrota tan temprana en un 'Grand Slam' desde Wimbledon 2021, cuando también cedió en segunda ronda, siendo hasta hoy su peor resultado en el cuadro principal de un 'grande' Fue una noche absolutamente desafortunada, terriblemente dolorosa y llena de impotencia para el murciano, que desde el inicio pareció fuera del partido tanto mentalmente como por su juego. En cambio, Van de Zandschulp, sin títulos en su carrera (solo dos finales y ambas perdidas en Múnich) y tras perder sus dos precedentes anteriores contra Alcaraz, se regaló un día inolvidable y la victoria más importante de su vida. Esta inesperada eliminación de Alcaraz en Flushing Meadows llega después de que en el Masters 1.000 de Cincinnati, su reaparición hace un par de semanas tras los Juegos Olímpicos, perdiera en su estreno ante el francés Gael Monfils, [ estrellara su raqueta en el suelo](https://www.relevo.com/tenis/carlos-alcaraz-cincinnati-destrozando-raqueta-20240816211035-nt.html) (un gesto inaudito en su trayectoria) y asegurara que había sido \"el peor partido\" de su carrera. Una velada trágica en Nueva York Avisaba Alcaraz justo antes de pisar la pista que el de Países Bajos es un jugador \"realmente talentoso\" y que debía ser \"agresivo\" para \"dominar el partido\". Tenía la lección aprendida, pero aun así Van de Zandschulp sorprendió con un inicio chispeante, mirando de tú a tú al español y combinando con mucho acierto secas derechas, golpes cortados, dejadas y subidas a la red. El arranque dejó varios puntos espectaculares al público del Arthur Ashe Stadium, pero no le vino nada bien a Alcaraz, que concedió un 'break' en su primer turno al saque y que empezó con deberes y un 3-0 en contra. El de El Palmar buscaba sensaciones, pero Van de Zandschulp se mantenía muy seguro con su saque y, en cambio, a Alcaraz se le empezaban a amontonar los errores no forzados. Al final llegó otra rotura para el neerlandés, que selló un set brillante y prácticamente perfecto en solo 30 minutos (6-1). El mejor ejemplo de cómo andaban las cosas para Alcaraz es que no logró ni un solo golpe ganador en toda la primera manga. Serio entre puntos y precipitado con sus golpes, Alcaraz buscaba a Juan Carlos Ferrero en busca de respuestas cuando mandó una derecha al pasillo que le entregó otro 'break' a Van de Zandschulp (2-1). \"Calmado y positivo, calmado y positivo\", le repetía su entrenador y por fin encontró un punto de luz devolviendo la rotura y soltando un \"¡vamos!\" directo al cielo de la Gran Manzana. Parecía el momento propicio para la heroica, pero no acabó de prender el fuego de la remontada y el partido bajó de pulsaciones sin que el neerlandés diera su brazo al torcer. Al contrario, fue Alcaraz, apagado y sin rastro de su característico brío, el que volvió a atascarse con varios errores hasta perder su servicio con una doble falta y entregar el segundo set (7-5) Camino del baño entre sets, Alcaraz se señalaba a la frente mirando a sus preparadores: no estaba mentalmente, su cabeza estaba fuera del partido. En su box, la escena y los rostros eran los de un funeral. En el Arthur Ashe, los fans miraban desconcertados sin entender qué estaba ocurriendo. \"No dejamos de luchar ni una\", pedía Ferrero, pero la velada parecía lejísimo de la épica. Un nuevo 'break' para el 3-2 dejó el camino franco para Van de Zandschulp, pero Alcaraz replicó con otra rotura y mostró una diminuta sonrisa que hizo creer a sus fans. Como si se hubiera quitado un peso de encima, Alcaraz firmó alguno de sus mejores puntos en ese rato y pidió apoyo a las gradas con la mano en la oreja. Fue un espejismo en una noche para olvidar para el español. Van de Zandschulp, imponente y magistral de principio a fin, rompió su saque con un juego en blanco camino de una victoria increíble y Alcaraz, fundido mentalmente, bajó los brazos y dijo adiós a Nueva York pidiendo perdón a los fanáticos antes de perderse por los pasillos del estadio.",

    "title": "Sylvain Saudan, ‘Skier of the Impossible,’ Is Dead at 87",
    "text": "Sylvain Saudan, who was widely known as the “skier of the impossible” for his audacious and potentially life-ending descents down some of the steepest, most inaccessible slopes in the world, died on July 14 at his home in Les Houches, France. He was 87.\nHis longtime partner, Marie-José Valençot, said the cause was a heart attack.\nThat Mr. Saudan lived into his ninth decade puzzled many people — including Mr. Saudan himself.\nBeginning in 1967, when he plunged down the Spencer Couloir on the Aiguille de Blaitière mountain in France — a 55-degree slope roughly equivalent, on skis, to a free fall — Mr. Saudan spent his life defying gravity, avalanches and obituary writers.\n“One mistake, you die,” Mr. Saudan once said. “You fall, you become a prisoner of the mountain — forever.”\nIn careening down alarmingly steep, previously untraversed slopes in the Alps, the Himalayas and elsewhere, Mr. Saudan helped create an entirely new sport: extreme skiing, now known as steep skiing. Its enthusiasts travel to remote peaks, often by helicopter, and try to have positive thoughts when looking down.\n“Death? It is there for everyone, but fortunately we forget about it,” Mr. Saudan told the Swiss newspaper 24 Heures in 2016. “If you only look at the negative side, you don’t move forward.”\nMr. Saudan’s adventures were chronicled in “Sylvain Saudan: Skieur de L’impossible,” a 1970 biography by the French journalist Paul Dreyfus; in several documentaries on extreme athletes, including “La Liste” (2016); and in sports publications around the world.\n“Everybody agrees that Sylvain Saudan is a nice guy,” Sports Illustrated wrote in 1971. “In European ski areas, where he is well known, they say Saudan is crazy. This doesn’t bother him much, although he prefers to call himself an adventurer.”\nMost steep skiers today fling themselves down slopes that are dangerous but not totally virgin terrain. But Mr. Saudan wanted nothing to do with slopes that had been previously skied.\n“Adventure for me is when you go to a remote place and do something challenging that no one has done before,” he told PowderGuide, a German online magazine, in 2016. “The first to dare something are the real adventurers, no matter how quickly or elegantly something is repeated by someone else. It’s the first that counts.”\nAfter he skied down the Spencer Couloir, nobody in the nearby town of Chamonix believed it. An airplane that flew over the next day came back with photographs of his tracks. Mr. Saudan soon moved on to skiing even riskier slopes on Monte Rosa in Italy, on the Eiger in Switzerland, on Mount Hood in Oregon and from just below the summit of Denali (then known as Mount McKinley) in Alaska.\nHe arrived by helicopter for most of his expeditions. But in 1982, at age 45, he climbed for 25 days to the 26,500-foot summit of Gasherbrum I in Pakistan. His descent, most of which was at a 50-degree angle, took nine hours and was recognized as a Guinness World Record.\nDespite the risks, he said he was never afraid.\n“Apprehension exists — I felt it especially before the first turn,” he once said, according to his obituary in The Telegraph . “But fear has no place. If you are afraid, it’s over.”\nEarly in his career, Mr. Saudan renounced the use of safety equipment. “If you have a rope or a parachute, then everything becomes much easier,” he said. “Anyone can do it with these aids. You know that if you fall, you’re not risking anything.”\nInstead, he relied on a maneuver he invented, which he named “the windshield-wiper turn,” in which he kept his weight on both skis and swiveled on his heels. “If I had tried jumping from outside ski to outside ski down the Couloir Spencer,” he told The Telegraph in 2016, “I do not think I would be talking to you now.”\nThe exact number of times Mr. Saudan’s life almost ended is impossible to quantify, but there were at least two memorable episodes.\nIn 1979, on Dhaulagiri in Nepal, heavy winds blew a block of snow on his tent. A doctor and a guide traveling with him were blown off the mountain and killed.\nIn 2007, after he had retired and begun working as a ski guide, he survived a helicopter crash in Kashmir.\n“The helicopter,” he later said, “was completely smashed, but everybody climbed out unhurt — not even our skis were broken.”\nSylvain Saudan was born on Sept. 23, 1936, in Lausanne, Switzerland. His parents, Armand and Cécile (Besse) Saudan, ran a small farm on their property.\nGrowing up, he tended the cows and skied in the winters. There were few educational opportunities. When he was old enough to drive, he worked as a truck driver and took courses to earn certification as a ski instructor.\nHis first job on the slopes was at Glenshee, a resort in Scotland. He would later credit Scotland’s icy winters with preparing him to ski down potentially deadly terrain.\nA few years later, he returned to Switzerland. One spring afternoon, he sneaked off to a steep, untraversed couloir on the north face of the Piz Corvatsch mountain in the Alps. Down he went.\nThe mountain’s ski director, Mr. Saudan told The Telegraph, “said I was a bad example to other skiers and took my lift ticket away.”\nIn addition to Ms. Valençot, Mr. Saudan is survived by his brother, Francis.\nMr. Saudan’s last major expedition was in 1986, on his 50th birthday, when he skied off the summit of Mount Fuji, Japan’s tallest mountain.\nBeing that it was September, there was no snow.\nHe skied down the rocks.\n“If you can ski on stones, you can ski on anything,” he told The Telegraph. “On Fuji, I did not fall once — I remember the Japanese journalists checking my sweater for cuts.”\nThere were none.\nThe post Sylvain Saudan, ‘Skier of the Impossible,’ Is Dead at 87 appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "Diputado paraguayo ayudó a escapar a narco brasileño, según medios brasileños\nMedios brasileños señalan que un diputado paraguayo de la zona de Amambay ayudó a a un narcotraficante brasileño a escapar de un operativo de la Secretaría Nacional Antidrogas (Senad), que fue realizado a pedido de la Policía Federal Brasileña.\nVarios medios brasileños señalan a un diputado paraguayo, pero sin dar nombre, como responsable de la fuga del narcotraficante brasileño Ronaldo Mendes Nunes, de 40 años, registrado en diciembre del 2023, en el marco de la Operación Sanctus, que se llevó en ambos países.\nLea más:\nAdmiten pedido de extradición por segunda causa de Samura\nDel lado brasileño, se incautó una aeronave, tres fusiles, tres escopetas y una pistola, además de cuatro vehículos, joyas y aparatos celulares, además de 60.000 reales y USD 10.000, mientras que se logró la captura del hermano, Hermógenes Aparecido Mendes Filho de 49 años.\nSin embargo, en Paraguay el operativo no tuvo resultado positivo, ya que Ronaldo Nunes Marques logró huir, aparentemente, gracias a la ayuda de un diputado. La información pasó desapercibida en Paraguay, ya que la Secretaría Nacional Antidrogas (Senad) no informó sobre el procedimiento.\nLa información que cita al político paraguayo aparece en la decisión del 3° Juzgado Federal de Campo Grande, que fue publicada este lunes, donde se niega la flexibilización de la prisión preventiva para Hermógenes Aparecido Mendes Filho, quien permanece en prisión, mientas que su hermano se encuentra prófugo.\nRonaldo Mendes se encontraba en Pedro Juan Caballero y la residencia ya había sido identificada por miembros de la Senad, pero al momento del procedimiento fue rescatado, según los medios brasileños, por el diputado paraguayo, quien presuntamente estaría implicado en el tráfico internacional de drogas.\nAsimismo, el medio\nNoticias Campo Grande señala que se trata de un político con bastión electoral en Pedro Juan Caballero y vinculado a poderosos narcotraficantes en la línea internacional y que ya había sido investigado por lavado de dinero, pero el caso fue archivado.\nEntérese más:\nSamura fue incluido en el sistema penitenciario de Brasil\n“Los narcotraficantes – Ronaldo Mendes Nunes y Hermógenes Aparecido Mendes Filho provienen de Coronel Sapucaia, ciudad separada por una calle de Capitán Bado, donde prevalece el crimen organizado”, señala el medio brasileño.\nAdemás, menciona que Mendes ya había cumplido condena por tráfico de drogas, pero Aparecido nunca había estado directamente vinculado al narcotráfico. En su contra sólo hubo la incautación de una gran cantidad de dinero no declarado.\nLa Policía Federal investiga a los hermanos por lavado de dinero, ya que hace unos 10 años se instalaron en Dourados y abrieron una carnicería en la zona residencial de Izidro Pedroso, pero en poco tiempo prosperaron, convirtiéndose en propietarios de empresas de transporte, propiedades rurales, casas y terrenos en condominios de lujo, además de un restaurante en Dourados y Ponta Porã.\nSegún la investigación, los restaurantes -al igual que las demás empresas del grupo- sólo sirven como fachada para el lavado de dinero procedente del tráfico de cocaína y oficialmente no cuentan con un solo empleado con contrato formal.\nEn los últimos años, varios camiones vinculados a los hermanos fueron incautados por la PRF (Policía Federal de Caminos) con cocaína escondida en las llantas.\nLa cocaína salía de Paraguay dentro de neumáticos de camiones y era conducida principalmente a Maricá (RJ), desde donde era enviada a Europa. El día del operativo se incautó 160 kilos de droga de un galpón perteneciente a los hermanos.\nVínculos con Comando Vermelho y Samura\nLas investigaciones también señalan fuertes vínculos de los hermanos con el Comando Vermelho. Coincidentemente, según otro medio brasileño, Jorge Teófilo Samudio, alias Samura, tiene el mismo domicilio registrado en la Secretaría Nacional de Tránsito que Aparecido Mendes y su familia.\nSamura había escapado de Paraguay durante una fuga realizada por un comando armado, que terminó matando al comisario Félix Ferrari en el 2019 en plena Costanera de Asunción.\nEn Brasil, fue detenido por uso de documento falso y posesión ilegal de arma en el 2021, en tanto que se tramitaba el pedido de extradición.\nLa última noticia que se tiene al respecto de Samura es que fue liberado en el 2023 por un juzgado de Brasil, pese a sus frondosos antecedentes.",

    "text": "Para dar cuenta de lo que implica la Semana Santa en un municipio como Fisterra basta decir que una tercera parte de su población, unas 1.500 personas, están implicadas en sus actos, ya sea integrando las cofradías, las bandas, los coros o ejerciendo de personajes vivientes. Así lo decía ayer el portavoz de la Xunta de Confrarías, Javier Trillo , quien aguardaba que el tiempo acompañase. Pudo salir la procesión de la Oración en el Huerto este Jueves Santo, pero hubo que recortar recorrido. En Vimianzo los oficios fueron en el templo y en Carballo no pudo ser el Víacrucis, aunque sí el tradicional lavatorio de pies, como en los demás puntos. BASILIO BELLO\nEn Fisterra estrenarán hoy, idea del sacerdote, una nueva estación, la Crucifixión , para la que se empleará el Cristo articulado. Será al final de la procesión del Santo Encuentro, a la llegada al atrio, sobre las 13.00. Cabe recordar que la Semana Santa de Fisterra está declarada de Interese Turístico. El movimiento se viene notando ya desde este miércoles, pero irá a más con el paso de las horas .\nProgramas hoy y mañana Laxe • Hoy es el gran día. A las 06.00, Canto á Paixón en verso.

As penas podem chegar a 17 anos de reclusão\natualizado\nCompartilhar notícia\nA Polícia Federal (PF) deflagrou, na manhã desta sexta-feira (10/5), a Operação Diploma Express. Três mandados de busca e apreensão foram cumpridos na capital do Amapá: nos bairros Jardim Marco Zero, Trem e na região central de Macapá.\nA operação tem o objetivo de desvendar esquema de cadastro falso e facilitação para emissão de certificados de conclusão de cursos. Segundo a PF, os servidores envolvidos se aproveitavam de uma questão burocrática da emissão dessas certificações em favor dos centros universitários, uma vez que os estabelecimentos que possuem menos de oito cursos não podem registrar os seus próprios diplomas.\nPara que esses certificados sejam validados, há a necessidade de envio dos diplomas para uma universidade federal, a fim de viabilizar o seu registro. Desse modo, estariam sendo remetidos diplomas de todo o Brasil para serem registrados na Universidade Federal do Amapá (Unifap), diante da baixa demanda para registro de diplomas no estado.\nA PF, no entanto, colheu indícios de que servidores da Unifap estariam cobrando uma “taxa de apressamento”, com valores de R$ 150 por certificado, para que os documentos fossem emitidos de maneira célere.\nNo decorrer das investigações, também foram colhidos indícios de que a Faculdade de Teologia e Ciências Humanas (Fatech), situada em Macapá, estaria emitindo diplomas contendo informações falsas.\nOs investigados podem responder por corrupção passiva e falsidade ideológica. As penas podem chegar a 17 anos de reclusão, mais pagamento de multa.\nA coluna não localizou representantes da Unifap. O espaço segue aberto.",
