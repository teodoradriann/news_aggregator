    "title": "US Open 2024: Jack Draper staying cool on his run to New York semi-finals - BBC Sport",
    "text": "Like the majority of teenagers, Jack Draper could sometimes sulk on the tennis court.\nThere would be the obliteration of racquets. There would be furious self-castigations. There were occasions where an apology to the umpire might be needed.\nAll that was part of the growing up process. And it has been a key part of the 22-year-old Briton's journey to becoming a US Open semi-finalist.\n\"His temper boiled over at times,\" chuckled Justin Sherring, the coach who developed Draper between the ages of five and 15.\n\"Did I have to call his racquet manufacturer a few times and say 'oops, I think Jack's racquets have snapped on the stringing machines that we've got here in India'? Yes.\n\"Did we have cross words a few times? Yes we did.\n\"But that's how it goes. Looking back, I'm so glad he did that.\n\"When you have this burning desire and feel greatness rumbling in your soul, you get frustrated.\"\nMinor disagreements happened. They always do between teenagers and adults assuming guiding roles.\nThe tales are told now by both Draper and Sherring with loving affection and a laugh. There is an understanding these escapades were instrumental in shaping the British number one's career.\nOnce there was a playful post-argument duel with water guns - Draper's way of light-heartedly diffusing the tension - with his coach in a American hotel corridor.\nIt happened at the prestigious Orange Bowl youth tournament, where Sherring realised Draper was \"quite nervous\" during a match.\nWith things not panning out as they hoped, the youngster flipped the middle finger at his coach.\nThat was permissible considering the pair's strong mutual bond. But Draper's \"monkeying about\" after the game resulted in him having to walk back to the hotel as Sherring \"needed some space\".\n\"Half an hour later, there is a knock on the door and it was Jack wanting to clear it up,\" Sherring told BBC Sport.\n\"I opened the door and he's got a water gun and starts zapping me with water.\n\"There was another one of the floor - he left one for me, which was quite considerate - so I picked it up and chased him.\n\"I thought 'is this how you normally make up after an argument? Is this what I'm in for?\"\n'The coaches, family and sacrifices behind Draper's success'\nPublished 5 September I have another 'level' for semi-final - Draper\nPublished 5 September How Britain's Draper became US Open semi-finalist\nPublished 5 September One of the most interesting things to observe during Draper's run in New York has been his cool demeanour - a stark contrast to those amusing anecdotes.\nWhether he has rolled over another opponent in his breakout run at a Grand Slam tournament, or is posing for Instagram content in Central Park, he has stayed calm.\nEven as recently as this year, it has not always been the case. Nerves have still lingered for Draper on the big occasions.\nAt the Australian Open he was sick at the side of the court because of the tension he was feeling on the way to winning his first-round match.\nOn the French Open clay, a dejected Draper was particularly demonstrative in a chastening first-round defeat by Dutchman Jesper de Jong.\nSo what's changed and how has it changed so quickly? Draper's current coach James Trotman explained after the quarter-final victory against Australia's Alex de Minaur.\n\"It does take the experience of being exposed to it, understanding how the momentum is going to swing, the concentration flows in the matches,\" he said.\n\"I just think he's maturing all the time. He's secure with his game, he understands that he can't go out and burn all of his energy and all of his emotions early on.\n\"It's just a sign that he's becoming more comfortable on this stage and playing with the best players in the world.\"\nImage source, Justin Sherring Image caption, A teenage Draper poses with two trophies won under the guidance of Sherring\nDraper, born and raised in Surrey, comes from strong tennis stock.\nHis mother Nicky - who the player credits as one of his biggest influences - is a coach and former junior champion, while father Roger was the chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association.\nOlder brother Ben was a former college player in the United States and now looks after his sibling's interests as his agent.\nThumping a tennis ball against the garage door at the age of one, which his mother says happened because he was copying his brother, was the first sign that Draper possessed the talent.\nA few years later, she took the boys down to Weybridge Tennis Academy where Sherring - a long-time friend of the Drapers - was the lead coach.\n\"I thought we were going to focus on Ben, so I had a hit and he was pretty good,\" Sherring said.\n\"Nicky asked if I could have a hit with Jack because they were looking for a coach for him. I said 'yes, but he’s quite little and quite young'.\n\"A hundred shots later I went 'wow'.\"\nDraper stayed under Sherring's tutelage for the next decade and the pair travelled around the world to hone the player's craft against other prodigiously talented youngsters.\nLargely they trotted around Europe, as well as trips to the Orange Bowl and ITF events in India.\nEnsuring Draper maintained his education was a key priority for his mother, however, who asked Sherring to teach him 10 words each day.\n\"Depending what mood I was in, or what mood he was in, I would think of a word that he might have been that day, like obstinate,\" he laughed.\n\"He'd ask what it meant and I'd say 'well, you've been it all day, look it up and come back to me'.\"\nThe teenager, however, only wanted to study tennis.\nTravelling back from losing to a Russian youngster at an event in Sweden, Draper questioned why he was still going to school when his opponent was already training professionally.\nThat was the beginning of his transition from leaving Reed's - an independent boys' school in Surrey which also counts Tim Henman and Hollywood actor Tom Hardy as notable alumni - to home education.\n\"He started wondering what he was going to school for, why he is hanging out with other kids, why he is doing what others are doing, it was frustrating for him,\" said Sherring.\n\"Then he lost to some muppet - in his words - after flying halfway across the world.\n\"But that's how it goes. You wouldn't see the warrior you see now if it had been all sunshine and roses, or strawberries and cream.\n\"It is nice to see a lovely boy doing what he is doing. There is a lot of love in the team and in the family. We all feel a great deal of love for him.\"\nRelated topics Tennis More on this story Live scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone\nPublished 6 June",

    "text": "Topline Artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI announced its latest chat model Thursday, starting a limited roll out of GPT-4.5, which OpenAI chief Sam Altman called a “giant” and “expensive” model that “feels like talking to a thoughtful person.”\nKey Facts OpenAI called GPT-4.5 its “largest and most knowledgeable model yet” in a document summarizing the new chatbot, saying user interaction with it feels more natural.\nOpenAI said the new model features a broader knowledge base, better emotional intelligence and improved contextual understanding, noting the improvements make it well-suited for problem-solving, writing and programming tasks.\nThe new model supposedly has fewer hallucinations— a common euphemism for when AI models produce inaccurate or misleading results.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts : We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nHow Powerful Is Gpt-4.5? GPT-4.5 has more than 10 times the amount of computational efficiency of GPT-4, according to the document, which means it takes less time and resources to solve a problem.\nWho Can Use Gpt-4.5? GPT-4.5 is only available to users subscribed to ChatGPT Pro, a $200 per month plan that gives users the highest level of access to OpenAI’s products. Altman said in a tweet OpenAI wanted to launch the new model on the ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro plans simultaneously, but could not due to a shortage of graphics processing units needed to support such a rollout. Altman added OpenAI will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week, allowing for GPT-4.5 to become available on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which is $20 per month.\nForbes Valuation We estimate Altman’s net worth at $1.1 billion , a figure established through the CEO’s investments in Reddit, Stripe and fusion power company Helion.\nKey Background The release of GPT-4.5 comes a little less than two years after OpenAI launched GPT-4 and just a few weeks after the company revealed “ Operator ,” an AI assistant designed to carry out tasks on the internet for users like grocery orders, ticket purchases and lecture downloads. OpenAI is also eyeing a funding round that could double its value to an eye-popping $340 billion. The funding round, if completed, would place OpenAI’s valuation far above competitors like the Elon Musk-owned xAI (valued at roughly $50 billion) and Amazon-backed AI firm Anthropic, which valued at $18 billion and is reportedly in talks for a funding round that would boost its valuation to $60 billion.\nFurther Reading OpenAI Eyeing Funding Round That Would Double Its Value, Report Says (Forbes)\nOpenAI’s ‘Operator’: What We Know About New AI Assistant Capable Of Ordering Groceries, Making Reservations (Forbes)\nWhat We Know About XAI As It Bolsters Itself For AI Race—With $6 Billion In New Funding (Forbes)",

    "title": "Students gather in support of their head baseball coach \"Rusty\" Miller",
    "text": "Early Thursday morning, a group of junior high and high school students protested in front of the Banquete administration building in support of district baseball coach Russel \"Rusty\" Miller. Miller is currently on administrative leave due to an allegation of a confrontation with a student, where he pushed him down in a chair, which students and parents claim are false. \"The story goes... a player stood up and that he pushed him down on the chair, which did not happen, \"Banquete High School senior Manuel Flores said. \"He got up and kind of stepped back a bit and then he sat back down. In the video, it kind of seems that way, but that’s not what happened.\" Flores is a player on the high school baseball team and he said he's proud of the students supporting his coach during this tough time. However, he is not happy that he will be missing their playoff game tonight due to this situation. \"He’s really important to us,\" he said. \"He’s not just important to me at the high school but to all these other kids at the junior high. He’s a mentor to them. He’s a mentor to me. I think that they’re doing a detrimental harm to us by keeping him away from us.\" This is not the first time that Miller has received allegations from the school. Around this time last year, parents said he received similar allegations that were proven false. The superintendent's secretary said that they would not be commenting at this time on the past allegations. Miller has been coaching in Banquete over a decade and is the assistant principal at the junior high. People who know him said that’s not in his character to do such a thing. \"I’ve known him since I was three,\" Junior High School Student Charles Kerr said. \"He’s a very kind person. He feeds me and takes care of me very well. He does that with everybody, and I know he wouldn’t put his hands on a kid ever.\" As for the reasoning behind the allegation, parents have said they contacted administrators for answers, but they haven’t received any information. \"We want answers,\" Banquete Resident Ashey Eldridge said. \"We don’t have any answers from our superintendent or our athletic director. Nobody has come out and told us what’s going on. A week and a half ago, Coach Miller was nowhere to be found. No one has said anything. No letters have been sent out and no acknowledgment. We find out by word of mouth.\" KRIS 6 News reached out to the superintendent Dr. Stacy Johnson for comment. The superintendent's secretary said she will not be commenting as it is an ongoing investigation and the employee is currently under paid administrative leave.

    "title": "ADHD symptoms can be ‘prevented’ in children by ditching conventional parenting, says study",
    "text": "Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) display specific behaviors and parents can help prevent the symptoms from developing further by being mindful of their parenting.\nAn estimated 7 million children in the U.S. aged between three and 17 years have been diagnosed with ADHD. As people with said condition [struggle with several daily tasks](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/doctor-with-adhd-swears-4-hacks-can-make-a-huge-difference/) that are easy for an average human to do, early intervention can be life-changing.\nADHD symptoms in children\nChildren with ADHD tend to be highly excited, and more curious compared to an average child. They also show positive responses to unfamiliar situations or people.\nAs the study by the University of Waterloo points out, exuberance in pre-schoolers is perceived as a “positive” trait, the children may find it difficult to regulate their emotions and could struggle with executive functions such as working memory and flexible thinking.\nUpon following 291 children from just four months to 15 years of age, the researchers found that symptoms of ADHD in children increase throughout childhood.\n“Symptoms of ADHD typically stabilize from ages five to nine and decrease from ages nine to 15. But for predictable cases of very young children with exuberant temperament and less directive parenting, that stabilization may not occur,” said Dr. Heather Henderson, the co-author of the study.\nDirective parenting can ‘prevent’ the symptoms\nWhile conventional parenting that involves more control over the child’s behavior may not work on children with ADHD, more directive parenting “can prevent the symptoms”, according to the study.\nThis means, that approaching children’s temperament by guiding them with verbal and physical cues is important.\nResearchers say parents can “break down the pathways” that lead to ADHD with engaged parenting behavior. [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/) notes that symptoms of ADHD are noticeable before the age of 6, either at home or at school.\nChildren with the condition tend to be inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive. Some of the more common symptoms include the inability to remember things or losing personal belongings, difficulty sticking to tasks or organizing them.",
