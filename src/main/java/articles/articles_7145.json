    "text": "In a fast-changing streaming landscape, advertisers can’t any longer rely solely on traditional targeting methods. That’s the message from Carl Strum , director of video futures at Interpublic Group’s Initiative, who is urging marketers to adopt a more nuanced approach to connected television advertising that emphasizes platform understanding, app-level precision, and contextual signals.\nIn this video interview with Lisa Granatstein , editorial director of Beet.TV, Strum explained that many brands still conflate devices and platforms when they should be thinking more strategically about how content is consumed.\n“When we ask ourselves the question of CTV advertising and reaching engaged audiences,” Strum said, “I often recommend taking a step back and thinking about the media channel and the platform we’re talking about — which in most cases is streaming and OTT.”\nWhile CTV is often framed around the device or screen — like a smart TV or Roku stick — Strum emphasized that audiences watch their favorite streaming platforms across a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones and desktops. That means Fortune 500 clients must consider where their key audiences are watching, not just how.\nPower of app-level targeting Once platform and device context is understood, the next step is getting granular with applications — specifically app names and IDs, which Strum called “really at the center of being able to manage an allow list for marketing campaigns.”\nThis level of specificity helps advertisers avoid playing “whack-a-mole” with low-quality inventory and ensures their media dollars are going toward trusted, brand-safe environments. Still, Strum noted that app identifiers vary across platforms, screens, and app stores — creating a technical hurdle that the industry must better navigate.\n“It’s a fairly technical thing,” he said, “but it’s something that I think the industry should be paying more attention to.”\nContent signals: New frontier of contextual relevance Strum also highlighted the rising importance of content signals, or “content object signals,” that can provide insight into the actual programs viewers are watching. But accessing that data isn’t always straightforward. One major roadblock is the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), a U.S. law that restricts how viewing data can be shared.\nStrum explained that privacy-compliant approaches, such as hashing and anonymizing data at the user level, are enabling more publishers to share content signals in a way that’s both legal and useful for advertisers.\n“We’ve been tracking this year over year,” he said, “and it’s increased across major streaming platforms and OEMs.”\nAnother barrier is the lack of standardization around metadata such as genres and show titles.\n“Right now, there’s no mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive list of every type of genre,” Strum said. “It’s kind of hard to bucket entertainment into key criteria.”\nStill, he believes that industry-wide guidelines, if not standards, could help advertisers safely and effectively tap into content-level data.\nRole of third parties and performance testing Strum also underscored the critical role of third-party verification and data partners. While buying platforms and direct publishers should remain the first point of analysis, third parties can “serve as the central hub for data that might live in disparate parts,” applying helpful metadata or categorizations that individual platforms may not support on their own.\n“The real combination—the use of both of them in tandem—is one of the best use cases,” he said.\nAdvertisers are becoming more sophisticated in developing allow lists, gaining better visibility into where their ads run, and scaling those efforts across platforms and devices, he said. However, that’s just the foundation. The next step is testing content-based variables to improve contextual alignment.\n“More and more performance data is showing the benefit of matching your brand’s message to the general theme of the program,” Strum explained. “There’s not always going to be 100% scale… but it’s really important for advertisers to start testing these out, seeing what works, and seeing how they can replicate with new campaigns.”\nBottom Line: Think beyond the device As CTV continues to grow as a dominant media channel, Strum’s message is clear: advertisers need to think beyond the device, get smarter with application-level controls, and lean into content-aware strategies that respect user privacy but allow for better contextual relevance.\nIn a fragmented media landscape, precision and adaptability are becoming the new imperatives for high-impact video advertising.\nYou’re watching “The Road to POSSIBLE 2025: Transparency and New Signals for CTV Success,” a Beet.TV Leadership Series, presented by Peer39.

    "title": "Good Friday 2024: The meaning and history – NBC New York",
    "text": "In the springtime, families around the world celebrate [Easter](/tag/easter/). For many [Christians](/tag/christianity/), Easter is an important holiday with church services to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. For others, it’s a secular celebration with bunnies, treat-filled baskets and decorated eggs. But two days before Easter Sunday is another important Christian holiday. Known as Good Friday, the holy day commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. Keep reading to learn about the meaning behind Good Friday and how Christians observe it: Get Tri-state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox. [Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.] More Easter Content: What is Good Friday? According to the Christian faith, Jesus was arrested and put on trial for claiming to be the Son of God. Roman authorities sentenced him to death by crucifixion. He was beaten and forced to carry a wooden cross to the place of execution — called Golgotha or Calvary — where he was nailed to the cross and left to die. Jesus was eventually taken down from the cross and buried, according to the Bible. Christians believe Jesus died on the cross to save humanity from its sins and restore people's relationship with God. Many Christians refer to this belief as the Atonement. Commemorating Jesus' crucifixion, Good Friday is a solemn day of mourning and reflection for Christians, who often attend special church services and prayer vigils. Good Friday is a part of Holy Week, which includes Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday, and Good Friday, leading up to Easter Sunday. When is Good Friday? In 2024, the religious holiday will take place on Friday, March 29. The date of Good Friday changes every year depending on when Passover occurs. Easter Sunday is always two days later. Why is it called Good Friday? So, what's so good about Good Friday? “It’s a very weird day to call ‘good’ when you have your savior and Messiah die,” said Rev. Dr. Brent Strawn, a professor of Old Testament at Duke Divinity School and an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church. “Why would you call that a good day?” The reason why Good Friday is called \"good\" is not entirely clear. One common explanation is that the word \"good\" originally meant \"holy\" in Old English, so \"Good Friday\" could be synonymous with \"Holy Friday\" or \"God's Friday.\" Strawn says he doesn't think the name is trivializing. “For those people who have Christian faith, it is a good thing that Christ died for us,” Strawn said. “It gave us peace with God and made us at one with God.” Strawn says another reason for the name Good Friday might stem from a deeper understanding of goodness and an awareness that Easter and the salvation of humanity are near. “For me, it really suggests that, in Christianity’s most robust and thoughtful forms, this is not a rejection of the sadness and tragedy of death, but rather a real thick understanding of the goodness that came out of a very tragic thing,” Strawn said. How do Christians observe Good Friday? Christians observe Good Friday in different ways, but here are some standard practices: Fasting: Some Christians fast to commemorate Jesus' sacrifice, while others will refrain from eating meat. Stations of the Cross: In this 14-step devotional practice, people retrace Jesus' final steps before his crucifixion. The stations are often represented through paintings in a church or outdoors. Good Friday Processions: Some countries and cultures march with images and statues of Jesus or reenact his crucifixion. Prayer and Church Services: Many Christians pray to contemplate the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and his death. Although Christians know Easter is approaching, church services on Good Friday often reflect the tone of the crucifixion and death of Jesus through Bible readings, prayers and hymns. Strawn says Christian worship services often end with Jesus’ words from the cross — “It is finished” — with the congregation leaving quietly in total darkness. “The downplayed or somber nature of worship on Good Friday shows that Christians are trying to take that low point seriously and to really feel the full weight of Christ’s death,” Strawn said.",

    "text": "转自：期货日报\n3月12日，沪铜主力2505合约高开高走，收盘报79470元／吨，涨幅2.04%。夜盘交易时段，沪铜2505合约盘中最高触及79970元／吨，创八个月新高。市场人士认为，此轮铜价上涨受美元走弱、国内外市场套利行为及供需基本面改善等多重因素驱动。\n“国内‘金三银四’消费旺季即将来临，产业买盘为铜价下方提供支撑。”新湖期货铜研究员李瑶瑶称，从历史走势来看，这个阶段铜价易涨难跌。\n从消息面来看，据SMM消息， 铜陵有色 金属集团旗下冶炼厂已采取减产、提前大修并延长时间、计划外大修等措施，冶炼厂联合检修忧虑短期明显提升，对铜价形成提振。\n从基本面来看，国元期货铜研究员范芮认为，供应方面，矿石供应整体紧张，进口铜精矿加工费维持负值，并且持续下调；国内废铜回收流转加快，但废铜贸易商对美国废铜进口态度较为谨慎，废铜供应整体不足，阳极铜供应目前有所回升，但受制于废铜原料紧张，阳极铜对冶炼厂的原料缓释效果暂不明显。据SMM调研，3月国内有三家冶炼厂有检修计划，涉及精炼产能98万吨、粗炼产能80万吨，较2月检修力度扩大，冶炼厂减产为市场隐忧。需求方面，空调行业最为积极，目前仍为空调行业生产提升期，出口订单仍将对空调生产带来一定积极影响，考虑到本冷年生产的提前启动以及空调外销周期，空调生产恐难以回到去年3月的水平。线缆和汽车行业需求在3月迎来季节性回升。\n“年初至今，铜精矿现货TC持续下行，已降至负值。Panama矿山2025年复产概率下降，全球铜矿紧缺形势较为严峻。”李瑶瑶称，在炼厂亏损的压力下，海外冶炼厂或率先开启减产，2025年全球铜矿供应增速下降有望传导至冶炼端。另外，受关税干扰，国内贸易商自去年年底便开始停止从美国进口废铜，今年一季度国内进口废铜或大幅下降，而且2024年高铜价透支了国内部分废铜隐性库存，2025年国内废铜供应也将收紧。国内炼厂受制于矿端和冷料端原料的短缺，产量释放存不及预期的可能，下半年或面临无法采购到足够原料被迫减产的情况。\n“需求端，虽然2024年新能源增速已明显下滑，但全球新能源基数已显著提高，增速放缓也不改变对铜消费的增量提振。”李瑶瑶认为，国内稳增长意愿较强，在财政等一系列政策提振下，国内经济有望进一步修复，而且从2024年开始国内电网投资迎来高增长。2025年年初国家电网公布的数据显示，今年投资将超6500亿元，同比增长8%。2025年国内铜消费增速预计回升至4.6%，全球消费增速回升至3%。2025年全球铜供需格局有转至紧张的可能。\n库存方面，交易所库存结构有所变化。从全球交易所库存情况来看，LME目前24.42万吨的铜库存水平依然处于高位；上期所铜库存自今年开年起持续增加，3月第一周小幅下降，目前维持在26.74万吨的偏高水平；COMEX铜库存结构变化与LME在时间和节奏上高度一致，不过COMEX库存近期维持在9.2万吨附近的高位水平。需要注意的是，LME和COMEX的库存累积与市场在金属关税忧虑下的提前布局有较大关系，并不会直接对铜价构成利空影响。\n展望后市，范芮表示，目前海外宏观市场相对动荡，但对铜价缺乏趋势性影响。铜价将继续受到供应紧张和下游消费平稳回升驱动，或走出先扬后抑行情。\n李瑶瑶表示，短期来看，在美国关税影响下，COMEX与LME价差持续走扩。在可观的套利空间驱动下，全球的铜正陆续运往美国。国内铜出口窗口已打开，炼厂将国内的铜运往海外。近两周国内以及LME库存均开启去化，且LME去化进度较快。国内消费旺季来临，全球铜现货市场紧缺局面或持续，对铜价形成提振。全球制造业的景气为铜价提供了较为有利的宏观环境，但近期美国经济数据走弱对铜价有所压制。考虑到特朗普关税政策将推升美国国内通胀，高利率背景下，美国经济下滑将成为铜价上涨的隐忧。后续需重点关注美国经济运行情况。\n编辑：张瑶",

    "text": "Winter can be a tough season on all of us, and nothing accentuates that hardship quite like a snowstorm! And I can tell you that first hand, having spent my childhood growing up just outside Boston. Not having had it cold enough though, I moved even further north to Montreal for university. In both cities, cold and snowy winters are the norm, and people have had to learn to live through it! A blizzard can seriously make you want to just hole up inside, and ‘hibernate’ with hot cocoa and cookies. And who could blame you? Where you were already enduring short days and long nights, now you’ve got freezing cold snow to add to it! While living through these hard winters, I’ve picked up a few methods to make life easier during these trying times! Whether its a way to avoid snow/ice related injuries or a trick to stay warm outside, you’ll be glad to have read this article by the next snow storm! Retractable studded winter boots offer you the grip of heavy duty hiking boots, but can fold up to go inside homes or businesses! ©TShaKopy/Shutterstock.com One of the first things I noticed during my first winter in Montreal was the popularity of retractable studded boots. These boots are generally made of heavy duty, waterproof materials- but are also outfitted with a secret feature. On the sole of the boot is a retractable, fold-out set of studs. These metal studs are designed to be flipped out and fold into an inlay cut into the rubber sole, providing extra grip! One of the most dangerous parts of a blizzard and the days following is the hazardous ice that covers the ground! Some snow melts during the day, pooling into puddles and then freezing as night brings sub-zero temperatures back. These frozen puddles can be everywhere, and difficult to see! Though everything would be salted in a perfect world, taking proactive measures on ones own is the best we can do! Getting a pair of these boots is one of the best strategies against slipping on ice. Having a full on pair of metal studded hiking boots would be a bit overkill, and you wouldn’t be able to wear them in homes or businesses. But with these boots you can flip them up when shopping, having a meal or visiting a friend. When it’s time to head back into the snowy and slippery outdoors, the studs can be flipped right back into place! Instead of slipping on hidden black ice and potentially suffering a serious injury, these boots will have you as sturdy as a seasoned hiker! Tucking your pants into your socks is one of the quickest and easiest ways to prevent that terrible cold shock of snow to the ankle! ©rck_953/Shutterstock.com Snowstorms leave cities covered in snow. And while city workers do their best to clear it as it falls, its an impossible task. Even a flurry can drop ice cold flakes onto your neck and leave enough snow to sneak into your shoes! To avoid getting even colder, there’s a couple of very easy ways to block out the cold and the snow! The first thing I figured out was tucking my pants into my socks. I could all but eliminate snow finding a way to give me that cold shock to the ankle! Another part of this was to start lacing my boots tightly. Therefore making sure there wasn’t any room for snow to sneak in, making my foot a cold wet mess for the day! That isn’t the only thing you’ll want to tuck in though, as the frigidness of snowstorms doesn’t stop at the knee! Tucking in your shirt goes a long way to keeping heat trapped to your body! And if you wear a scarf, tucking it into your collar can help block out those stray snowflakes landing on your neck! Sticking to roads with more car and foot traffic is usually a good move! The busier the road, the more frequently its plowed. And people who used the sidewalk already have beaten down a path through the snow! ©Andrei Stepanov/Shutterstock.com Traveling on more heavily trafficked roads may seem like a surefire way to lose time and beat around the bush. But in blizzard conditions, safety needs to be the number one priority. Additionally, when blizzard conditions are at their worst some smaller roads and especially residential sidewalks are unlikely to be cleared! In a car, while potentially losing time to traffic, the busier roads are more likely to be plowed and salted. Not only are they safer to travel on, but sometimes they’re actually the only roads where travel is truly possible! In cities, where snow removal can be a complicated process, prioritizing plowing on busy roads is a logical step. But the same logic applies to walking! When walking during or directly after a blizzard, finding cleared sidewalks and walking paths is difficult! The less busy the road is, the less of a chance anyone else has walked down it before you! That leaves you walking through inches of snow and getting your pants soaked! Instead, I figured out that making a beeline to popular routes allowed me to piggyback on the ‘path more traveled’! If a busy road is lined with businesses, shoveled sidewalks are common as well! Whether driving or walking, the most direct and shortest route isn’t always the best way to go! When it gets super cold and snowy, you can’t be worried about looking fashionable! Cover up as much as you can and prioritize your warmth above all else! ©Andrei Stepanov/Shutterstock.com Though it may sound obvious, when its super cold you’ve just got to forget about being fashionable. Outfits that have numerous visible layers and opened coats will leave you freezing in the cold at any time. After a blizzard this is only heightened as the chance of slipping and getting wet is all too possible! Whether its ice or a snowbank, not having waterproof outerwear could easily mean you need to go home and change! Its not only uncomfortable to continue through a day in wet clothes, there are many potential health risks! I may not have felt like a fashion icon when I arrived to class in university, but I was warm enough to focus! When the snowstorms get really bad, this might mean wearing equipment usually reserved for skiing! Whether going to campus or if you’re just on your way to get groceries, don’t count it out! Snow pants and waterproof boots make snow banks and unshoveled sidewalks much less of an impasse!

    "text": "[Sebastián Casas ](/autores/sebastian-casas) Serranía del Chiribiquete: Petro dice que ganado venezolano es “comprado por narcos” Petro dijo que el pensar del narcotraficante es que en Chiribiquete \"solamente es cortar los árboles y ya se tiene una hacienda\". El ganado proveniente de Venezuela, comprado por narcotraficantes colombianos a bajos precios en el vecino país y traído por la porosa frontera común, se está convirtiendo en el principal depredador de la selva amazónica, advirtió el presidente Gustavo Petro. Durante el evento ‘Anuncio de financiación para el Parque Nacional Natural Serranía de Chiribiquete’, por parte del Gobierno de Alemania, que donará un millón de dólares al año -inicialmente por tres décadas-, el mandatario aseguró que esta modalidad delictiva es una forma de lavado de activos que debe ser analizada.

El que hace eso quiere tener una hacienda grande como se tiene en la costa Atlántica, con ganado. Es una cultura feudal de creer que tiene poder el que tiene tierra, pues eso ya no se usa en Europa ni en los Estados Unidos, pero aquí sí”, sostuvo. El jefe de Estado explicó que el pensar del narcotraficante es que en Chiribiquete “solamente es cortar los árboles y ya se tiene una hacienda. Esa es una cultura económica premoderna”, dijo, y se preguntó: “¿Por qué ese ganado está tan lejos del principal mercado consumidor de carne de Colombia, que es Bogotá? ¿Por qué se está tumbando el bosque para meter más ganado?”.

Esa idea de bloquear a Venezuela trajo el ganado que estaba ya en la altillanura para la selva amazónica, se convirtió en un motor de la depredación y de la destrucción. Este es uno de los efectos que está produciendo la depredación de la selva amazónica y que hay que analizar, porque en la discusión política mundial esto no apareció como parte del análisis”, señaló. El presidente Petro ahondó en su hipótesis así: “Unos narcotraficantes colombianos con muchos dólares pueden comprar todo el ganado de Venezuela a bajo precio porque se bloqueó a ese país y allá necesitan los dólares. Se trae por la frontera, que es porosa, no tiene guardas, no hay guardaparques, no hay Estado propiamente, y va entrando poco a poco a las haciendas nuevas de praderas que van hacia Chiribiquete y otros lugares”. Agregó que son los campesinos que traen los propios narcotraficantes, o que llegan desplazados de otras regiones, quienes cuidan esa “economía premoderna”; entonces llegan a Chiribiquete, “donde les pagan por tumbar la selva, y quien les paga se va a quedar con su gran hacienda a esperar que llegue un gobierno a que le titule su hacienda, como pasó en los Llanos del Yarí o en el Caquetá. Es un mecanismo de lavado de activos”, afirmó el mandatario.",
