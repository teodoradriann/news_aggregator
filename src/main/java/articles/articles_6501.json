    "title": "Israel’s Ben-Gvir: far-right kingmaker who wants Hamas eliminated",
    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was known as a hardline extremist even before he became one of the lynchpins of the most right-wing coalition in Israel’s history.\nBurly, bespectacled and rough-spoken, Ben-Gvir, 48, has appeared to delight in offending anyone not aligned to the views of the pro-settler, nationalist-religious constituency behind his Jewish Power party.\nHis visit on Tuesday to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, just as ceasefire negotiators were preparing for another bid to end the fighting in Gaza and halt a spiral into regional war, was the latest in a series of actions that have often seemed designed to inflame outrage.\nThe visit, and his declaration that Jews should be allowed to pray there in defiance of decades-old status quo arrangements covering a site holy to both Muslims and Jews, drew international condemnation.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly disavowed and rebuked Ben-Gvir, whose visit also outraged Orthodox Jews who consider the Temple Mount, revered as the site of Judaism’s two ancient temples, too sacred a place for Jews to enter.\nFor Ben-Gvir, who was photographed brandishing a gun at Palestinian demonstrators in East Jerusalem during the 2022 election campaign, the row served merely to reinforce his status as a firebrand.\nTogether with his fellow hardliner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, he has clashed repeatedly with Netanyahu and other members of the cabinet, notably Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, a representative of the Israeli defence establishment he has always deeply distrusted.\nLike many on the Israeli right, Ben-Gvir, who lives in a West Bank settlement, entirely rejects any talk of an independent Palestinian state and has pressed for an intensification of the war in Gaza, even as the death toll among Palestinians has passed 40,000.\nA disciple of Meir Kahane, a rabbi who wanted to strip Arab Israelis of citizenship and whose party was designated a terrorist organisation by the United States, Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2007 of racist incitement and support for a group on both the Israeli and U.S. terrorism blacklists.\nWORLD OPINION\nOver the years, he has toned down his rhetoric, saying he no longer advocates expulsion of all Palestinians, just those he deems traitors or terrorists.\nBut his appointment in 2022 by Netanyahu as National Security Minister, with responsibility for the police, was one of the clearest signs that the new government would pay little heed to world opinion.\nHis position in government assured by the kingmaker role he and Smotrich played in forming Netanyahu’s government, which holds a narrow but stable 4-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament, he has paid little heed to criticism.\nHe has repeatedly attacked the army and Netanyahu over the conduct of the war in Gaza, opposing any deal with Hamas and threatening at times to bring the government down if it agreed to a deal without destroying Hamas.\nSo far, he has not given any serious indication that he would carry out such a threat, which would tip his party from power along with the prime minister.\nBut he has repeatedly drawn the ire of the United States, Israel’s most important ally, over his rejection of a political solution with the Palestinians and his support for violent Jewish settlers who attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\nAnd, as demonstrated by his visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, one of the most sensitive locations in the Middle East, he has lost none of his willingness to provoke.\n(Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

    "text": "Bah e Hjulmand foram titulares na vitória dinamarquesa, por 2-0. Espanha e Sérvia não foram além do nulo\nEm Copenhaga, Dinamarca e Suíça enfrentaram-se em partida a contar para a fase de grupos da Liga das Nações . Alexander Bah e Morten Hjulmand foram titulares na formação dinamarquesa, enquanto Amdouni foi suplente utilizado nos helvéticos.\nA Suíça jogou de branco, mas quase não pareceu dada a quantidade de cartões vermelhos mostrados à formação helvética. O 'festival' começou na segunda parte, aos 50 minutos, quando o árbitro da partida reverteu o cartão amarelo mostrado a Elvedi e expulsou o jogador por travar uma clara oportunidade de golo.\nO equilibrio que se verificou na primeira parte deu lugar ao domínio dinamarquês na segunda, uma vez que estavam a jogar contra 10 unidades. Ainda assim, só aos 82 minutos é que os comandados de Lars Knudsen conseguiram desfazer o nulo. Skov Olsen combinou com Dorgu na área suíça e o jogador do Lecce não perdoou.\nSe a partida já estava difícil para os suíços, ficou ainda mais a partir dos 87 minutos. Xhaka, que já tinha cartão amarelo depois de se envolver numa confusão com Hjulmand, voltou a ver a cartolina amarela e também foi expulso. A jogar contra 9, a Dinamarca não deixou fugir a vitória e ainda foi a tempo de dilatar a vantagem, por Hojbjerg (90+2').\nHjulmand e Xhaka numa confusão entre ambos (IMAGO) A emoção do Dinamarca -Suíça contrastou com a monotonia do Sérvia - Espanha , do mesmo grupo. Apesar do domínio espanhol, os campeões europeus não conseguiram desatar o nulo numa partida onde o guarda-redes sérvio, Rajkovic , foi herói ao fazer cinco defesas.\nTags: Suíça Dinamarca Espanha Sérvia",

    "text": "Manchester tornado leaves family safe amid chaos and damage (Image: Getty) A family have spoken of their miracle escape from a tornado raging at up to 160mph which tore their home apart.\nGareth Moody said that they were “lucky to be alive” after a chimney crashed through his son’s bedroom ceiling, missing him by “centimetres” but wrecking the family’s three-storey house in Greater Manchester.\nThe council licensing worker, his wife Lyndsey, their three children and son-in-law fled to safety through the remains of the Stalybridge home to find their street had been turned into a “bomb site”.\nAround 100 homes were damaged as the Storm Gerrit twister caused mayhem, destroying cars and uprooting trees.\nThe weather phenomenon that hit Greater Manchester has been provisionally labelled as a T5 tornado by officials.\nConfirmation came from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation following a site investigation and review.\nThe twisters are assessed on a scale from 0 to 10, with five considered “intense”.\nAccording to the International Tornado Intensity Scale, a T5 has a wind speed of 137 to 160mph.\nAlthough it is rare to hear of them in the UK, meteorologists have said tornadoes can occur regularly across the nation.\nA Met Office spokesman said: “Tornadoes in the UK are fairly common. Around 30 are reported a year, and can often occur at this time of year.\"\n“However, they’re usually short-lived events or occur in places where they can’t create much of a tangible impact.”\nThe weather experts describe a tornado as a rapidly rotating column of air that reaches between the base of a storm cloud and the ground.\nThey form in very unsettled weather conditions as part of severe thunderstorms.\nA violently whirling mass of air, known as a vortex, forms beneath the storm cloud. A funnel cloud then develops as the vortex spins due to the reduced pressure.\nIt is thought this twister was caused by a supercell thunderstorm, a squall that exhibits persistent and deep rotation.\nTrending\n The Moodys were in their front bedroom when what police called a “localised tornado” struck at 11.30pm on Wednesday.\nGareth, 45, said: “There was a massive crash so I got up. I went to the back door because I wanted to make sure everything was safe, when there was another crash and the lights went out.\n“I ran back upstairs and looked up to see a huge, gaping hole in the ceiling. It was completely gone.\n“It was mayhem, bedlam. The chimney stack from next door had been blown out and came through our roof. We managed to get my daughter, son-in-law and our two sons out into the street.\"\n“I think we are lucky to be alive. The boys are especially lucky because the chimney stack crashed into one of their bedrooms. It’s a miracle that no one was killed.”\nGareth added: “The chimney stack is actually in my son’s room in one whole piece and missed him by centimetres.”\nNurse Lyndsey, 45, added yesterday: “It had started hailstoning...the whole house was shaking and the wind was howling.\n“I went to look out of the window, which seemed like it was being sucked out by the wind. As I turned round to move away the whole ceiling just came down. I screamed and then the hallway literally gave way.\"\n“The chimney came down and took out the rest of the house.”\nThe couple’s sons Thomas, 15, and Jack, 22, were in their upstairs bedrooms when the roof and chimney fell into Jack’s room.\nGareth said: “My wife was screaming and my two lads were in a panic. I was saying, ‘We have to get out, we have to get out’.\n“We managed to escape and everyone is safe. But it feels like death because this is everything we have worked for.”\nThe couple’s daughter Rebecca Saycell, 20, and her husband Thomas, 27, fled their basement bedroom, while dogs Phoebe and Penny plus cat Jesse escaped too.\nRebecca said: “We got outside and saw that our roof had gone. All the cars in the road were covered with rubble.”\nLyndsey said: “It was like something from a film. You could hear the whirl of it and then it was gone. How do we fix that...where are we going to live?”\nThe village of Carrbrook was also badly hit by the whirlwind. Electrician Richard Harrison, 52, yesterday looked at a roof tile embedded in the boot of his £30,000 three-month-old Vauxhall Grandland car and said: “I honestly thought a plane had come down because we are on the flight path into Manchester Airport.\"\nREAD MORE Storm Gerrit leaves thousands of homes without power as it causes chaos\n“It is an absolute miracle that no one was killed because I dread to think what could have happened if the tornado had hit in the daytime with people on the streets.\"\n“There were roof and ridge tiles flying all over the place. You can tell the strength of the wind by looking at the tile in my car.\"\n“It took some force to do that. It was unbelievable. I’ve never seen anything like it. The street looks like a bomb site with debris all over. Some people’s houses have been totally wrecked.”\nGreater Manchester Police chiefs declared a “major incident” as officers were called out to “numerous reports of significant damage”.\nResidents of the Hough Hill Road area of Stalybridge, in the foothills of the Pennines, yesterday relived the horror of the storm’s 30-second blitz of destruction.\nAndy Turner said: “There was what I can only describe as a hurricane which came through. My wife’s car is a write-off, my car’s took a bit of the brunt of the tree.\"\n“It’s just lucky that nobody was hurt. It was pure carnage.”\nAndy Wareham’s Tesla had its windscreen smashed. He said: “Things started flying around. There was about 30 seconds to a minute of chaos and then it calmed down. Straight away I said, ‘It must have been a tornado’.”\nREAD MORE\nMet Office gives unsettling weather warning as UK to be engulfed by -8C storm The UK is facing severely unsettled weather conditions - and a fierce drop in temperatures is set to hit later in the week. The country has been painted yellow in weather warnings as the Met Office warns of brutal winds and icy showers.\nWinds could reach as high as 130kmph in Scotland .\nMatthew Marsland, who lives opposite houses that were badly damaged, said: “I just heard an extreme noise. I was stood at the patio doors and there was basically a crazy sounding noise.”\nThe privately-backed Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said site investigations would be required to confirm the damage was caused by a rare UK tornado.\nChief Superintendent Mark Dexter, of Greater Manchester Police, said: “This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.\"\n“Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers.”\nA Met Office spokesman said that early reports from the area indicated that “a tornado at the surface was likely” to be the cause of the destruction.\nThree men inside a 4x4 which plunged into a river yesterday afternoon (thurs dec 28), according to the police.\nFirefighters pulled the vehicle from the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors yesterday afternoon.\nA fourth man who attempted to save the people inside the vehicle had to be pulled to safety himself and was later receiving medical treatment.

    "text": "Okposo retires a Stanley Cup champion after 17 seasons Kyle Okposo is ending his playing career a Stanley Cup champion. The veteran forward officially announced his retirement from the NHL on Thursday after 17 seasons in the league, split between the New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres, and, most recently, the Florida Panthers. \"Thirty years of playing hockey was incredible,\" Okposo [wrote](https://x.com/CAAHockey/status/1836797419859923405) in a statement. \"It brought me to some amazing places and provided such unique experiences. I believe the game is in a great place right now, but the possibilities are vast. I'm looking forward to continuing to contribute to the game as it reaches new heights.\" Okposo racked up 242 goals, 614 points, 554 penalty minutes, and 953 hits in 1,051 career NHL games. He began his tenure with the Islanders, who selected him with the seventh overall pick at the 2006 NHL Draft. A four-time 20-goal scorer, Okposo enjoyed his best statistical seasons in Long Island, including a 69-point effort in 2013-14. His nine-season run with the Islanders ended during the 2016 offseason, when he signed a seven-year, $42-million deal with the Buffalo Sabres as an unrestricted free agent. Okposo was the Sabres' representative at the 2017 All-Star Game. Buffalo named him the 20th captain in franchise history ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. The Sabres never made the playoffs during Okposo's eight seasons in Buffalo, and the franchise traded him to the Panthers at the 2024 deadline in exchange for defenseman Calle Sjalin and a conditional seventh-round pick. Okposo appeared in six regular-season games for the Panthers before getting into 17 playoff contests, including Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final against the Edmonton Oilers. He chipped in with two assists during his first taste of postseason action since 2016. The 36-year-old was the third Panthers player to lift the Cup after captain Aleksander Barkov and goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky. \"I learned from the veterans when I was young, and I tried to take what I saw in those special men and forge my own path to help guide the next generation of players,\" Okposo said. \"Thank you to all my teammates for the lessons you taught me every day.\"",
