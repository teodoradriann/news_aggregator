    "title": "First Weekend of Spring",
    "text": "A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY continues for most of northern Montana into Saturday morning. A WINTER STORM WARNING has been issued for the Rocky Mountain Front from Thursday morning through Friday. A WINTER STORM WATCH has been issued for parts of northern and eastern Montana from Saturday morning through Sunday evening. It's the first weekend of spring but widespread snow will really pile up while temperatures will run 20-30 degrees below normal as winter won't give up easily. Thursday has been an active day already with a storm system moving through the state with rain showers, snow, sun, wind, clouds and even a few isolated thunderstorms. Friday the cold air takes over almost the entire state with a little light snow scattered about the northern part of the state. Steady snow will fall along the Rocky Mountain Front. Highs will be in the 20s and 30s but areas like Missoula, Dillon and Bozeman will still be dry and warm with highs in the 40s to 50s. Widespread snow is likely this weekend with significant accumulation of several inches in some areas to more than a foot in other areas. Highs will be in the 20s and 30s with snow on both Saturday and Sunday, lows will dip into the 0s and 10s. The heaviest snow will be up across the Hi-Line and along the Rocky Mountain Front. Cold, snow showery weather will continue on Monday and Tuesday as well. It's possible that more than 12-18\" falls across many of the lower elevations in the state through the weekend into early next week. The mountains will see feet of snow that will provide a boost to the snowpack. It's a moisture miracle March! Have a great day, Curtis Grevenitz Chief Meteorologist",

    "title": "The Ultimate BTS Camera: We Review the Insta360 X4 | Fstoppers",
    "text": "I’m new to the 360 camera space, but after just a week or two with the new Insta360 X4, I can't see myself using my GoPro again. Ever.\nTo kick things off, my primary use for Insta 360 X4 is to capture behind-the-scenes footage of me working. So while this camera can do a ton of things that creators will find useful (which I'll touch on), I really just need decent footage that I can use for Instagram Reels, YouTube, and Patreon.\nIn the past, I used a GoPro mounted to the button of my camera. This approach worked but also had a lot of limitations. The main one is the field of view. The GoPro has a pretty wide lens, but no matter where you place it on the camera, you’ll never be able to see the subject and me shooting at the same time. This leaves the footage feeling very static and unengaging. There were also times when I would set the GoPro up off-camera, and this led to always having to adjust the positioning to make sure it was pointed in the right direction or tilted up/down in order to encompass the entire scene. This not only took extra time, but most importantly, it took up more of my mental capacity than I was willing to dedicate to the task. This led to multiple situations where I would just forfeit any BTS recording because I didn't want to deal with it or didn't have the time.\nThat’s where the Insta360 X4 is a game changer for me. Because it's always capturing video footage in all directions, there is no need to think about how you set the camera up. There is no adjusting the angle left and right or the tilt up and down. You simply set the camera up and hit record. You can then adjust where in the frame you want the video when you get to post-production.\nThis ability to endlessly reframe the video, for me, is the number one reason this makes the perfect BTS camera. Not only do I not have to worry about adjusting the camera, but I also now have the ability to show myself in the scene as well as the subject. In post, I can also add movement to the video where maybe the video starts showing me and then pans to the subject. This adds more interest to the clip as well as gives you a lot more options in post-production.\nThe new Insa360 X4 also now films in 8k30 which gives you a lot more freedom to zoom into the frame. But for me, I ended up keeping it on 5k60 for the ability to slow parts of the clips down a bit. But even at the lower 5k resolution, I was still able to grab clips in both horizontal and vertical aspect ratios without any issues. This ability is another way that Insta360 wins over GoPro. Because in the past, I had to choose whether to film horizontally or vertically. And because I used my footage mostly for horizontal spaces, the video just had to suffer when it got shared to vertical platforms. But with the Insta360, I get the best of both worlds.\nAll I have to do is edit the clip how I want within the free Insta360 app or software for horizontal. With a GoPro, I’d then have to crop into the video to convert it to verticle. This almost always leads to losing important parts of the video. However, with the Insta360, I can change the format to vertical, and it can simply zoom out to show what I need since there is 360 degrees of footage.\nOne thing that it's important to know, though, is that the 360 video is a combination of footage captured on two different sensors and lenses. This is important because there is a space in the video where the two different videos are being stitched together. Most of the time, this is barely noticeable. However, I found out that this characteristic becomes more apparent when things are closer to the camera. So when I mounted the X4 to my camera, I initially just had it pointed directly forward and back. But what this did was make the stitch seam travel through my camera and face.\nHowever, an easy fix for this is simply to rotate the camera a bit so that this stitch seam travels just in front of the lens and to the side of the camera. Which was a weird concept for me to grasp at first. It's just because it looks off with the 360 camera pointing at an angle. But because it's capturing everything all at once, the rotation of the camera doesn't really matter.\nThankfully, when you take the footage into post-production, the ease of use remains equally simple. You can very intuitively drag video footage to show the area of the video you want to show. You can also easily set where you want to start the video clip and then have the camera “pan” to another section in the video with just a couple of clicks. So I can have a super wide shot showing me and the subject, then have the video zoom into the subject as well as track them through the video. However, one of the hardest parts about 360 video is that you are capturing so much that it can sometimes be hard to narrow down what you want to show. And it's here where they have an AI-based framing feature that analyzes your video clip and will automatically cut pieces of content from that clip so you can pick and choose what you want to use. But for me, I usually know exactly what I want to show, so I tend to manually edit and cut the clips.\nOne of my favorite and most used features for recording BTS is the ability to quickly start recording as well as easily stop and delete footage. Sometimes, when capturing moments, it's hard to know for sure if something interesting will happen. So as soon as something starts to happen, I can press the record button and, even if the camera is off, it will turn on and start recording. If nothing happens, I can long press the record button to simultaneously stop recording and delete the clip. This saves a ton of time in post-production without having to go through clips where nothing happened or have to dive into menus to delete footage from within the camera. One thing I wish though, was that the start time from off to recording was a bit faster.\nFrom here, capturing BTS footage is only a small drop in the bucket of what this camera can do. From high-resolution still images to reproducing drone-style footage, to even making crazy slow-motion Matrix-style video clips known as bullet-time. One look at some of the X4 promotional material, and you'll quickly see how much potential this little setup can give you!\nI also feel it's important to mention some of the specifics around the specs of this camera. As mentioned before, it can shoot video in 8k30 as well as 4k60 and even 4k100. It can take still images at 72 megapixels and also has an HDR mode for both still and video. I also have no complaints about the battery life with 135 minutes of run time. It's also super easy to swap out batteries if you have a long day of shooting and the entire camera is waterproof up to 30m. There is also the ability to use a dedicated underwater housing if you want to go deeper.\nThere is also a host of accessories. From invisible selfie sticks to extra-long invisible poles, as well as the special spinning rig used for recording bullet time videos. They also have special lens protectors, but unless you're filming in a hazardous environment, I'd recommend not using the guards because they can result in unwanted flaring and artifacts. The camera also has a USB-C port that offers quick charging. I loved having this because when I charge my Sony a7cR via USB-C, I could easily charge the 360 camera simultaneously. This makes the process of using an everyday camera along with an everyday BTS camera pretty seamless.\nWhat I Liked Set-it-and-forget-it style filming while being able to capture everything and reframe in post-production Quick recording with the ability to quickly cancel Solid build with great battery life What I Didn't Like Wish the start time was faster Have to be a little conscious of where the stitch seam will be in certain situations From the start, I always thought 360 cameras were a one-hit-wonder type of device. Thankfully, I was dreadfully wrong. This camera has drastically increased my ability to capture BTS footage while also making the process easier, more dynamic, and more engaging. If you are considering a GoPro, or currently use a GoPro, I'd highly recommend looking into the new Insta360 X4 . If you have an older Insta360 X3, I feel like this newer model would be worth the upgrade.",

    "text": "Two Businesses Team Up to Save Corry Easter Festivities Ryan Sander and Samantha Clabbatz were scrolling through Facebook when something caught their attention. \"Just kind of seeing the negative impact that it was having on the community, the poor feedback that it was getting,\" said Ryan Sander, owner of Sander Land & Home Realty. A post from the Corry Area Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday announced the cancellation of its Easter Egg Hunt and Easter Bunny Breakfast events. \"My heart went out to them,\" said Samantha Clabbatz, co-founder of French Creek Settlement Services. \"The lack of volunteerism in the community is tough.\" The Chamber of Commerce said its shift in focus to downtown businesses, along with the rising costs of candy, prizes and materials, were factors in the decision-making. Immediately after seeing the post, however, Clabbatz and Sander decided to sit down and come up with a plan: an Easter Egg Hunt at Mead Park on Saturday, March 30th at 11 a.m. \"There's been a few really heartfelt reactions that have been kind of tear-jerker,\" Clabbatz said. One Corry resident recalls the same Easter egg hunts when she was a child at Mead Park, ecstatic to hear the event is making a return to the community. \"They were amazing because we hung out with our friends beforehand, we hung out with their friends after,\" Tyleeza Reagle said. \"It was just fun and exciting during the Easter break to see all your friends again because that was when you [had] a longer Easter break.\" As downtown Corry prepares for the holiday in late March, the Easter Bunny will make an appearance at the event and take pictures with kids. \"We're actually working with the Chamber of Commerce,\" Clabbatz said. \"They've agreed to give us all of their eggs, their costumes and all of their signage.\"",

    "text": "每年《政府工作报告》中的新词热词总会引发热议。今年的政府工作报告首提“零碳园区”，提出扎实开展国家碳达峰第二批试点，建立一批零碳园区、零碳工厂。业界普遍认为2025年将是零碳园区元年。作为接下来做好“双碳”工作的一大重点，零碳园区不仅是对“双碳”目标的坚定回应，更是中国经济高质量发展的关键一跃。\n　　什么是零碳园区？它是指在一定期限内，通过各种技术手段，将园区运营过程中产生的温室气体排放量中和，实现净零排放的产业园区。作为比零碳园区更小的“零碳单元”，零碳工厂则是指工厂从事生产、经营过程中直接或间接产生的温室气体排放，按照二氧化碳当量计算，达到综合为零的状态。建设过程中，不仅涉及能源结构优化、清洁能源大规模应用，还包括绿色建筑、数字化管理、 碳交易 等多个方面的技术创新与应用。\n　　如何看待零碳园区的战略价值？零碳园区是经济转型的“必答题”。产业园区是支撑我国经济发展的关键环节，同时也是碳排放的重要来源。在高质量发展和应对气候变化要求下，过去那种高耗能、高排放的发展模式已难以为继。零碳园区通过 新能源 替代、循环经济、智能管理，可大幅降低单位产值能耗，减少碳排放，推动产业经济从“规模扩张”转向“质量跃升”。\n　　零碳园区是国际竞争的“新赛道”。气候变化已对全球贸易产生深远影响，全球碳关税壁垒加速形成。未来几十年，全球贸易和供应链将会被重塑。今年的政府工作报告提出，积极应对绿色贸易壁垒。绿色低碳是提升制造业国际竞争力、突破绿色贸易壁垒的重要途径。零碳园区生产的“绿钢”“零碳铝”等产品，将成为畅行全球的“绿色通行证”。依托绿色生产要素，零碳园区也将成为构筑全新低碳产业集群的关键载体。越来越多的西部地区，可以利用自身丰富的可再生能源资源，创建绿色产业集群，打造高质量发展新高地，实现后发赶超。\n　　零碳园区是能源革命的“必经路”。随着 新能源 装机占比不断提升， 新能源 生产与消纳出现了错位现象。今年的政府工作报告提出，统筹就地消纳和外送通道建设。零碳园区恰好可将能源生产与使用有机结合，促进绿电本地消纳，培育新工业体系，助力“双碳”目标达成。\n　　探索推进零碳园区建设，顶层设计是重要 驱动力 。2024年12月，中央经济工作会议首次提出“零碳园区”概念。此后，工业和信息化部明确表示，探索推进零碳工厂、零碳工业园区建设。地方政府和企业纷纷制定相关政策和规划，加大投入力度。此次零碳园区首次被写进政府工作报告，将进一步加速零碳园区建设。\n　　在政策推动下，零碳园区已从“概念热”逐步走向落地。在内蒙古 鄂尔多斯 市，全球首个零碳产业园正在为零碳新工业基地“打样”。该园区以“风光氢储”技术为核心，构建了从绿电生产到零碳制造的闭环。作为布局全球的动力 电池 制造商， 宁德时代 已建设多家零碳工厂。这些零碳园区和工厂的成功实践，证明了高质量发展与高水平保护，本就可以共生共赢。\n　　尽管前景光明，但零碳园区建设所面临的挑战也不小。一方面，零碳园区需要大量先进技术支撑，如可再生能源高效利用、 储能 技术的优化等。这些技术目前仍存在成本高、稳定性差等问题。另一方面，零碳园区标准体系尚不健全，许多地区对如何建设零碳园区缺乏清晰的思路和实施路径。此外，零碳园区和零碳工厂的建设需要大量前期投资，这对一些地方政府和企业来说是不小的经济负担。\n　　为顺利推进零碳园区建设，我们需要加大对新能源、 储能 、碳捕集等技术的研发投入，突破技术瓶颈，降低应用成本。加快制定各级零碳园区建设标准，明确碳排放核算方法和评价指标。加强对零碳园区的财政补贴和税收优惠，积极引导社会资本共建共享。当零碳园区从一个个“盆景”连成一片片“森林”，中国经济高质量发展的底色必将更加青绿盎然。\n（文章来源：经济日报）",

    "title": "La production de Boeing en partie paralysée par sa première grève inédite depuis 2008 - 13/09/2024 à 19:28 - Boursorama",
    "text": "Les syndiqués de Boeing dans la région de Seattle en grève, le 13 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nPlusieurs dizaines de milliers d'ouvriers de Boeing ont lancé vendredi une grève inédite depuis seize ans, bloquant notamment la production dans son berceau de la côte nord-ouest américaine.\nL'arrêt de travail a débuté après le rejet massif du projet de nouvelle convention collective, négocié depuis mars par Boeing et l'antenne locale du syndicat des machinistes (IAM) et qui devait succéder à celle datant de 2008 qui expirait jeudi à minuit.\nLes plus de 33.000 syndiqués de l'avionneur dans la région de Seattle - sur quelque 170.000 employés du groupe - ont rejeté l'accord annoncé le 8 septembre à 94,6% et approuvé un débrayage à 96%, selon Jon Holden, président de l'IAM-District 751.\nIl a également annoncé un recours contre Boeing auprès de l'agence fédérale chargée du droit du travail (NRLB) pour pratiques déloyales pendant les négociations.\nJon Holden, président du syndicat IAM-District 751, à Seattle, le 12 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nLa dernière grève, en 2008, avait duré 57 jours.\nFace au mécontentement des adhérents, M. Holden avait toutefois affirmé ne pouvoir \"garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève\".\nCe débrayage paralyse les deux grandes usines d'assemblage de Renton et d'Everett, qui produisent le best-seller 737 MAX, le 777 et le 767 (version cargo et ravitailleur militaire), dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.\nLa production d'autres sites, notamment une usine de pièces détachées à Portland (Oregon) tout proche, est également arrêtée, tout comme le réusinage de dizaines de 787 Dreamliner effectué à Everett depuis plusieurs mois.\nEn revanche, l'assemblage du Dreamliner n'est pas perturbée à ce stade car l'usine se trouve en Caroline du Sud (est) et n'est pas concernée par cette convention collective.\n- \"Chancelant\" - L'avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60%) à la remise des avions. Il peut livrer ceux ayant reçu le feu vert du régulateur FAA avant la grève mais son rythme de production fonctionne au ralenti depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines.\nUn Boeing 777 en cours d'assemblage à l'usine d'Everett (nord-ouest), le 26 juin 2024 ( POOL / Jennifer Buchanan )\n\"Pour un Boeing financièrement chancelant, une grève est la dernière chose dont il avait besoin\", selon Leeham News, site spécialisé dans l'aviation.\nD'après les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d'affaires.\n\"La grève va affecter la production, les livraisons et les activités, et elle va menacer notre reprise\", a affirmé vendredi matin Brian West, directeur financier de Boeing, lors d'une conférence organisée par une banque.\n\"La grève injecte tellement d'incertitudes\" qu'il s'est refusé à toute prévision pour 2024 et 2025, assurant que la priorité était de \"préserver nos liquidités\".\n\"Le message selon lequel l'accord de principe conclu avec les dirigeants de l'IAM n'est pas acceptable pour ses membres est clair\", avait réagi Boeing, se disant \"prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\".\nUne semaine après sa prise de fonction le 8 août, le nouveau patron de l'avionneur Kelly Ortberg s'était engagé à \"réinitialiser\" la relation avec le syndicat.\nVers 17H20 GMT, l'action Boeing chutait de 3,72% à la Bourse de New York.\nLes adhérents du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751 ont approuvé la grève, le 12 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nLa convention collective rejetée prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25% sur quatre ans, un engagement d'investissements dans la région, ainsi que la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - autour de Seattle, ce qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.\nBoeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève. Sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019 (346 morts), et moult problèmes de qualité de la production.\n\"Ce n'est un secret pour personne: notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune\", prévenait mercredi soir M. Ortberg, exhortant les employés à ne pas \"sacrifier\" les progrès futurs en raison de \"frustrations liées au passé\".\nMais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+40% initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant. \"On nous a bradés\", a lancé jeudi à l'AFP Kamie Bryan, employée chez Boeing depuis 18 ans.\n\"Ils parlent d'une augmentation de 25%, mais ce n'est pas le cas\", a déclaré Paul Janousek, dénonçant une présentation \"trompeuse\" par Boeing. Selon cet électricien de 55 ans, dont treize chez l'avionneur, son augmentation n'atteindrait qu'environ 9% du fait de la suppression d'une prime annuelle.\nSelon le règlement de l'IAM, les grévistes recevront 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d'arrêt de travail.",
