    "title": "Biden Orders Sanctions on 4 Israelis Over West Bank Violence – DNyuz",
    "text": "President Biden on Thursday ordered broad financial and travel sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of violent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, a forceful gesture aimed in part at Arab American voters in the United States who have expressed fury about the president’s backing of Israel’s war in Gaza.\nMr. Biden authorized the sanctions with an executive order that goes further than a directive issued in December by the State Department, which imposed visa bans on dozens of Israeli settlers who have committed acts of violence in the West Bank. The sanctions will initially be imposed on four Israelis , who will be cut off from the U.S. financial system and from accessing any American assets or property. They also will be prevented from traveling to the United States or engaging in any commerce with people in the United States.\nFor Mr. Biden, the order served a dual purpose: It was a sharp diplomatic notice to Israel’s government at a time when the United States is pressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for restraint. But it also sent a message to Arab Americans, a key part of the political coalition he needs to be re-elected, that he is serious about using the power of the United States on behalf of the Palestinians.\nThe executive order comes after years of American frustration with Israeli settlers, whom they view as a source of violence and instability and a threat to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. And it comes as Mr. Biden faces growing criticism over U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza, including from members of his own party. American officials fear a recent surge in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank could set off even wider violence, making an already combustible situation worse.\n“This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” said Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser.\nIsrael’s war against Hamas is taking place in the 141-square-mile Gaza Strip, home to about two million Palestinians. But there are also deep tensions in the West Bank, a much larger area that Israel has occupied since 1967. It is home to more than 2.5 million Palestinians and has long been at the heart of the territorial dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.\nPalestinians and many analysts say that Israel’s government has allowed the often heavily armed settlers to act with impunity inside the West Bank. A United Nations report said that eight Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank by Israeli settlers since Hamas fighters from Gaza invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people.\nThe office of Mr. Netanyahu responded to the sanctions by saying the “vast majority” of Israeli West Bank settlers were “law-abiding citizens.” Israel “acts against lawbreakers everywhere, so there is no need for exceptional steps in this matter,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.\nThe White House announced the sanctions just hours before Mr. Biden held a campaign event in Michigan, a critical battleground state that has a large Arab American population and has been the site of numerous protests over the war in Gaza.\nBefore leaving for Michigan, Mr. Biden spoke about what he called “the trauma, the death and destruction in Israel and Gaza.” Speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, he pledged to work for the release of hostages held by Hamas and the lives of Palestinians.\n“Not only do we pray for peace, we are actively working for peace, security, dignity for the Israeli people and the Palestinian people,” he told the group of lawmakers and religious leaders at the event.\nMichigan is vital to Mr. Biden’s campaign for a second term. In 2020, he won the state over former President Donald J. Trump by 154,188 votes out of almost 5.5 million cast that year. On Thursday, the president stopped by a Black-owned restaurant outside Detroit and met with about 100 members of the United Auto Workers, the union that had recently endorsed him.\nAgainst a backdrop with posters like “UAW 4 JOE” and “Unions heart Joe,” the president credited the labor movement for having the “strongest economy in the whole damn world,” and dismissed skeptics who had predicted that “China’s going to eat our lunch. Well guess what, man? We don’t taste that good.”\nLauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said Mr. Biden was eager to thank Shawn Fain, the union’s president, who was at the event, and to draw a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump in a state where union workers could decide who wins the presidential election this year.\n“He’ll continue fighting against Donald Trump’s historically anti-worker agenda,” she said, promising that Mr. Biden would “make many trips to Michigan” in the next several months.\nMichigan is home to several hundred thousand Arab Americans, most of whom live in the Detroit area. Those areas voted by big margins for Mr. Biden in 2020.\nBut since the attacks by Hamas and Israel’s response in Gaza, polls show the president losing support among Arab Americans. One poll late last year showed Mr. Biden’s support in that population plummeting from 59 percent to 17 percent, a more than 40 percentage point decrease since the last election.\nMr. Biden has been dogged by people protesting his support for Israel at almost every campaign event in recent weeks. At a third stop on Thursday, at the Simple Palate restaurant, he was met by a number of protesters waving Palestinian flags and using a megaphone to chant, “Genocide Joe” and “How many kids have you killed today?”\nOsama A. Siblani, publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, said on Thursday that Mr. Biden’s standing among Arab voters was as low as it had ever been, and that the sanctions would do nothing to change that.\n“We have given up on him doing anything,” Mr. Siblani said, adding that he had been struck by the lack of specificity from the White House about the president’s schedule in Michigan, which he said seemed like an attempt to avoid possible protests.\nBefore Mr. Biden’s travel on Thursday, the White House and the president’s re-election campaign had provided only scant information about where he was going.\n“If the community is not going to be able to protest his visit,” Mr. Siblani said, “we’re going to give him the answer on Feb. 27,” a reference to the date of the Michigan Democratic presidential primary.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Biden’s campaign disputed the idea that the campaign was being secretive, noting that Mr. Biden often appears at small events that are not announced in advance.\nThe protesters believe that Mr. Biden has not done enough to prevent the killing of thousands of Palestinians by Israel. Authorities in Gaza say at least 26,000 people have been killed during Israel’s military campaign against Hamas.\nOfficials said the sanctions would not be levied against American citizens living in Israel. State Department officials identified the four Israelis who were named in the sanctions on Thursday as David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil, Shalom Zicherman and Yinon Levi.\nIn a news release on Thursday, officials said Mr. Chasdai had “initiated and led a riot” resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian and assaulted other Palestinians. They said Mr. Tanjil had been “involved in assaulting Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs.”\nMr. Zicherman “assaulted Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank,” officials said, citing video evidence. They said Mr. Levi had threatened “violence if they did not leave their homes, burned their fields, and destroyed their property” in the West Bank.\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement that the sanctions are designed in part to pressure Israel’s government to prevent the kind of violence by its citizens against Palestinians living in the West Bank.\n“The United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine stability in the West Bank and the prospects of peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” Mr. Blinken said. “Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it.”\nThe post Biden Orders Sanctions on 4 Israelis Over West Bank Violence appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "By Rehan Khan ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP): A group of Pakistani women pilgrims have credited the improved Hajj arrangements and facilities to the Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Chaudhry Salik Hussain. Expressing their gratitude, the women praised the minister for providing enhanced facilities and better services throughout their journey from Pakistan to their accommodations in Saudi Arabia. In interviews conducted by a media team from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony in Madina, the pilgrims shared their experiences and expressed satisfaction with the clean and neat accommodations, high-quality and hygienic food, and the helpful and cooperative staff. The women acknowledged the efforts of the federal minister in improving the services provided to pilgrims, stating that they faced no challenges concerning living, eating, traveling, or performing their religious rituals. A pilgrim from Sialkot, Nasreen Akhtar praised the cleanliness of her hotel and the quality of the food, commending the performance of the cooperative staff. Another pilgrim, also from Sialkot, Lubna described the living environment as peaceful and praised the Hajj mission’s administration for taking proper care of the pilgrims. The pilgrim from Sialkot, Nida expressed her gratitude to the government for providing accommodation near Masjid-e-Nabvi, noting that it takes her only three minutes to reach the mosque. She mentioned that the staff quickly responded when she encountered a problem visiting Riyazul Jannah. A pilgrim from Pattoki, Shazia appreciated the good reception at the airport and the efficient transfer of luggage to the hotel. She added that the pilgrims have not observed any negligence in terms of performance, cooperation, or behaviour from the supporting staff. Another woman, who chose to remain anonymous, described the Road to Makkah project as beneficial and noted that the spices used in the food were particularly suitable. Farzana Mughal from Sadiqabad said the arrangements made by the Pakistani government in Saudi Arabia had doubled her pleasure for Hajj. “I feel as though I am with my own family again, after receiving the attentive care and support from the dedicated staff assisting us,” she added.",

The details of Iran’s potential course of action had already been communicated to the Director General in advance. In alignment with this position, the President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran has issued directives to initiate the operation of a substantial number of advanced centrifuges of various models,\" the ministry said in a statement. On Thursday, media reported, citing sources, that the IAEA Board of Governors had adopted a resolution criticizing Iran for its lack of cooperation on the nuclear issue. The resolution submitted by the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the United States was approved by 19 out of 35 countries. Russia, China and Burkina Faso voted against it, while 12 countries abstained, the report said on Thursday.The resolution requires the IAEA to prepare a comprehensive report on Iran by the spring of 2025, Reuters reported.",

    "text": "O PPM propôs esta quarta-feira a criação do Parque Natural do Toco, salientando que se trata do “último paraíso do Funchal” e onde poderá nascer um polo “didático e cultural”, que também servirá os estudantes madeirenses.\n“O PPM sinaliza desde já o compromisso de criar, se vier a integrar o Governo da Região Autónoma da Madeira, o Parque Natural do Toco, na praia do Toco”, disse à Lusa o número dois da lista do PPM às eleições regionais antecipadas de dia 23, Luís Ornelas.\nSalientando que se trata do “último paraíso do Funchal”, onde existe uma grande variedade de vida selvagem, Luís Ornelas alertou que não se pode deixar “este espaço morrer em prol do betão”.\n“Não precisamos de mais betão, precisamos de mais políticas ambientais e sustentáveis”, salientou Luís Ornelas, adiantando que a ideia será criar naquele local “um polo a nível didático e cultural e também um polo de atração turística”.\nMas, ao mesmo tempo, um local onde os estudantes madeirenses possam ter aulas práticas, nomeadamente aulas de biologia, “para aprenderem a plantar, semear”, acrescentou o candidato, reforçando que o PPM “é um partido ecologista” e que “a questão ambiental é central”.\nA zona onde o PPM pretende criar o Parque Natural do Toco é uma zona florestal, entre o Garajau e a Fortaleza de São Tiago, na zona velha da cidade do Funchal.\n“Este local constitui uma das últimas zonas do concelho do Funchal, no qual sobrevive uma natureza intacta, resiliente aos grandes empreendimentos turístico”, destacou ainda o candidato do PPM, partido que concorre pela primeira vez com uma lista própria numas regionais na Madeira.\nA lista do PPM é encabeçada pelo coordenador regional do partido na Madeira, Paulo Brito.\nEm 2015, o PPM concorreu nas regionais integrando o projeto denominado Plataforma de Cidadãos, em conjunto com o Partido Democrático do Atlântico (PDA) que obteve 903 votos (0,71%), num universo de 127.539 votantes, sem conseguir eleger qualquer deputado.\nAs legislativas da Madeira, as terceiras em cerca de um ano e meio, decorrem no dia 23, com 14 candidaturas a disputar os 47 lugares no parlamento regional, num círculo único: CDU (PCP/PEV), PSD, Livre, JPP, Nova Direita, PAN, Força Madeira (PTP/MPT/RIR), PS, IL, PPM, BE, Chega, ADN e CDS-PP.\nAs eleições antecipadas ocorrem 10 meses após as anteriores, na sequência da aprovação de uma moção de censura apresentada pelo Chega — que a justificou com as investigações judiciais envolvendo membros do Governo Regional, inclusive o presidente, Miguel Albuquerque (PSD) — e da dissolução da Assembleia Legislativa pelo Presidente da República.\nO PSD tem 19 eleitos regionais, o PS 11, o JPP nove, o Chega três e o CDS-PP dois. PAN e IL têm um assento cada e há ainda uma deputada independente (ex-Chega).",
