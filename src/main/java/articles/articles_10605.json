    "text": "There has been lots of misinformation in recent days, the most dominant being that Prezzo Bill Ruto has been grounded by the anti-tax protests fronted by Gen-Z. The correct position is that he has not travelled abroad as part of self-imposed austerity measures. As he would say, he leads from the front. We can also report authoritatively that following enormous pressure from the youthful protesters, Prezzo Ruto has instigated drastic staff cuts in his communications office so he’s now relying on ChatGPT to his write speeches. This explains the dissonance between Chat-GPT scripts and what Prezzo Ruto intended to convey to the nation this week. For instance, Prezzo Ruto’s Tuesday night speech did not contain a message of condolences to the families of the young Kenyans who died under a hail of police bullets. A robot, after all, can’t think of humans. The same application is to blame for the substitution of “young protesters” with the nefarious tag of “organised criminals,” which Prezzo Ruto revised in a subsequent speech on Wednesday, referring to the young protesters as “our children.” I am not sure if and how ChatGPT was deployed to communicate with folks at Mazingira House who run the nation’s spy network, but a similar dissonance was reported. When Prezzo Ruto said he was keen on engaging with Gen-Z, dozens of youngsters were abducted from their homes at wee hours and driven around the city and its environs until they felt kizunguzungu. Then they were dumped in the middle of nowhere, entranced. A similar miscommunication was reported in the deployment of Kenyan police officers to Haiti. I understand Prezzo Ruto had intended to send them to the streets of Nairobi to quell the riots. Instead, they were delivered to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and dispatched to Haiti. By the time Prezzo Ruto realised the mix-up, Nairobi was under such a severe strain, he had to call in the military to quell the protests. So egregious was the error, the matter was before the court. It was to determine if we are a police or military state. The impact of ChatGPT has gone beyond the courts. Some chaps filmed feeding greedily at the Parliament canteen at the height of the protests denied that their behaviour was “unparliamentary’’. Our waheshimiwa eat till they vomit on our shoes, they said. In any case, they were there to “benchmark” how the MPs eat and adopt that menu for the entire nation. Even a man who was caught carting away a TV set on Tuesday denied that he had stolen the item; he said he had borrowed it from a city store to watch if the street unrests would be televised. Once the protests were over, he’d return it. When the man told this to a cop who had stopped him, the cop was so incensed that he aimed at the set and opened fire, blasting it into smithereens. The crook wept he’d miss that action on television. I understand local telcos were challenged why Internet connectivity slowed down on Tuesday. They denied any wrongdoing and attributed the slow down to a new phenomenon called “disturbances,” like the one that routinely affects the Kenya Power. As for Kenya Kwanza MPs who giggled when a local journo asked Prezzo Ruto how development would be delivered to Kenyans, the government has clarified that the MPs, led by Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichun’gwa were laughing because they thought the journo’s voice sounded like that of ChatGPT. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter There was a similar miscommunication among protesters; while they had spent the day plotting how to scale the walls to the State House, there was a last-minute change of address. Instead, they said they would head to Parliament because Parliament was now an extension of the presidency.",

    "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- The federal corruption trial of former Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan continued Thursday, with testimony from a well-known politician who worked closely with the so-called \"Velvet Hammer.\"\nAlso heard Thursday were multiple audio recordings from Madigan's close associate's phone.\nMadigan and his codefendant and longtime confidant, lobbyist Michael McClain, are facing a 117-page, 23-count indictment that charges them with racketeering, conspiracy, bribery, and wire fraud. Most of the counts carry up to 20 years in prison if they are convicted.\nThey are accused of a bribery scheme involving multiple businesses—including ComEd—in which the businesses paid Madigan's associates as a reward for their loyalty to Madigan. Federal prosecutors said Madigan used his various political positions as part of a long-term scheme to arrange for no-show jobs for his political workers, and personal benefits for himself and his law firm.\nA large part of the testimony Thursday surrounded the relationship between Madigan and the other man named facing charges with him.\nThe government played many phone calls—they plan to play more than 200 in total—and they showed the jury email and written correspondence between Madigan and McClain.\nTestimony began Thursday with testimony from former Deputy Illinois House Majority Leader Lou Lang—a Democrat from Skokie who resigned in 2019 after sexual harassment allegations.\nLang spoke about what it was like to work with Madigan—especially after the sexual harassment allegations against Lang came to light. Lang claimed the allegations were false.\nAfter that, Lang testified that though Madigan never ordered him to do anything by way of legislation, McClain did call and ask him to resign following the sexual harassment allegations. He said he felt like he didn't have a choice.\nLang testified that McClain told him to resign \"as an agent of the speaker.\"\nLater, an FBI agent on the case took the witness stand. The prosecution played multiple recordings taken from wiretaps of McClain's phone.\nMost notably though, a letter from McClain announcing his retirement was read in court.\n\"I want to let my 'real' client know I am willing with [my wife] Cinda's blessing to do 'assignments,' Michael, you will have to decide if you want me to do it, legally and ethically. At the end of the day, I am at the bridge with my musket standing with and for the Madigan family,\" McClain's letter read. \"I will never leave your side.\"\nThe government then played recordings dated after that letter to show the two working together.\nAs of 4 p.m., testimony was still under way at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse.\nMore from CBS News Chicago man accused of assaulting, robbing 2 USPS carriers 140,000 unclaimed property checks in the mail for Illinois residents, totaling $13.2 million One of El Chapo's sons begins plea negotiations with Chicago federal prosecutors Longest-serving exonerated man in Illinois filing lawsuit In: Lou Lang Corruption Mike Madigan Illinois House of Representatives",

    "text": "New Illinois law mandates paid time off for workers SPRINGFIELD (WGEM) - A new Illinois law takes effect Jan. 1, mandating businesses give their full-time employees at least 40 hours of paid time off annually. “This is about bringing dignity to all workers because that is who is impacted by paid leave for all,” state Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed the legislation on March 13. She, along with state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, sponsored the [legislation](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?name=102-1143&GA=102&SessionId=110&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=208&GAID=16&SpecSess=&Session=). The law requires employers give full-time workers at least one hour of paid time off per 40 hours worked and allow them to accrue a minimum of 40 hours of paid time off annually. “Thanks to this measure, workers have the peace of mind that they can take care of themselves today without worrying about the consequences tomorrow,” Lightford said at the signing ceremony. While the law may bring peace of mind to workers, Noah Finley, the Illinois state director for the National Federation of Independent Business said it brings uncertainty to small businesses across the state. “They’re facing this new mandate they’re having to figure out and, like, we’ve held webinars, the Department of Labor has held webinars but they’re still trying to figure out exactly what that means,” he said. “And it’s going to cost them, they know that, but exactly how that plays out is not entirely clear and it’s just a whole slew of uncertainty.” Adding to the uncertainty, is the Illinois Department of Labor’s (DOL) rulemaking process. Though the new law goes into effect Jan. 1, Finley said he doesn’t expect to see DOL’s rules approved until at least March. Businesses can learn more about the new law on the DOL’s [website](https://labor.illinois.gov/laws-rules/paidleave.html). There’s also a link to a poster all businesses must display informing workers of their rights under the new law. Some workers are exempt from the new law. They include federal workers and college students who work part-time for the university. Copyright 2023 WGEM. All rights reserved.",

Ils se dispenseraient de commentaires par leur énormité. Pas de trêve olympique pour la population de Gaza, mais des records de destruction et de bombardements rappelant la fin de la IIe Guerre mondiale, la guerre de Corée et celle du Vietnam. Ces chiffres seraient-ils porteurs de nouveaux paradigmes dans cette tragédie qui secoue le Moyen-Orient ? Le 7 août 2024, l’UNICEF [[1]](https://blogs.mediapart.fr/michael-maschek/blog/220824/gaza-derriere-les-chiffres-une-guerre-contre-la-population#_edn1) recense 39 623 tuées et 91 400 blessés à Gaza. Le bilan ne serait pas complet en oubliant la douzaine de milliers de personnes portées ensevelies sous les décombres ou « disparues ». Soit près de 145 000 victimes. In fine, une journée moyenne de bombardement de l’armée israélienne coûte la vie entre 139 à 169 civils, dont 60 % de femmes et d’enfants. La suite : [https://blogs.mediapart.fr/michael-maschek/blog/220824/gaza-derriere-les-chiffres-une-guerre-contre-la-population](https://blogs.mediapart.fr/michael-maschek/blog/220824/gaza-derriere-les-chiffres-une-guerre-contre-la-population) Mais ces chiffres ne concernent que les 40 000 morts officiels, complètement sous-évalués selon des sources plus crédibles, comme le Lancet : [https://www.revolutionpermanente.fr/La-guerre-genocidaire-a-Gaza-fera-au-moins-186-000-morts-d-apres-The-Lancet](https://www.revolutionpermanente.fr/La-guerre-genocidaire-a-Gaza-fera-au-moins-186-000-morts-d-apres-The-Lancet) « Le célèbre journal scientifique britannique « The Lancet », qui fêtait l’année dernière ses 200 ans et dont peu de gens nient l’autorité sur les questions médicales et de santé publique, a publié vendredi 5 juillet [une enquête](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext?s=08#%20) consacrée au décompte des victimes gazaouies depuis le 7 octobre 2023. D’après les estimations, si l’offensive s’arrêtait maintenant, les dégâts considérables et les risques sanitaires résultant des opérations génocidaires de Tsahal porteraient le bilan de la guerre de Gaza à des niveaux apocalyptiques : l’armée israélienne serait ainsi à terme responsable de 186 000 morts. Comme l’expliquent les auteurs de l’enquête, « les conflits armés ont des effets indirects sur la santé, au-delà des blessures directes causées par la violence. Même si un conflit s’achève immédiatement, il continuera d’y avoir beaucoup de morts indirects dans les mois et les années qui viennent du fait des maladies reproductives, infectieuses et non-infectieuses ». Si le ministère de la santé gazaoui décompte, au 19 juin 2024, 37 396 victimes de l’offensive israélienne, les morts indirectes causés par les effets de l’offensive seront beaucoup plus nombreux. Considérant ces chiffres fiables et rappelant qu’ils sont reconnus [par les services secrets israéliens eux-mêmes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3w4w7/israeli-intelligence-health-ministry-death-toll), les chercheurs tentent de déterminer le nombre des morts indirects que causera l’offensive en cours à Gaza dans les mois et les années à venir. » Ainsi, selon les chiffres du Lancet, il faudrait multiplier par 4 le nombre de victimes dans la bande de Gaza, soit 8% de la population et non les 2% de Haaretz. Calculez ce que ça représenterait par rapport à la population de la France ! Et il y en a que le mot de génocide choque !",

    "text": "As revelações sobre a atuação do ministro Alexandre de Moraes no Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) seguem repercutindo na política. Dessa vez, uma nova reportagem da Folha de São Paulo, publicada nesta quinta-feira (15), afirmou que o gabinete do ministro teria usado o TSE para acessar dados da polícia. Segundo a nova reportagem, o policial Wellington Macedo, que integrava o gabinete de Moraes no Supremo Tribunal Federal, teria feito pedidos ao chefe da Assessoria Especial de Enfrentamento à Desinformação (AEED) do TSE, Eduardo Tagliaferro, para apurar fatos relacionados à segurança do magistrado e de seus familiares.\n\"Curioso não ter nenhuma mensagem para apurar compra de votos, investigar se traficantes estão praticando coação eleitoral, punir caixa dois ou transporte irregular de eleitores. Moraes só mandava seus capachos pesquisarem posts de internet de quem ele discordava. Frouxo\", criticou o deputado Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG), na rede X.\nVeja Também:\nGabinete de Moraes usou TSE para acessar dados da polícia, diz jornal Em outra publicação, Nikolas ressaltou \"quem dera se Moraes gastasse o mesmo tempo e energia de perseguição contra o crime organizado e corruptos, como faz com senhoras, pessoas sem antecedentes criminais, com garota de 16 anos, baderneiros e meras postagens de internet\".\n\"O papel desse juiz se resume a uma mentirosa “defesa da democracia”, já que não ataca nenhum personagem real que destrói nossa democracia\", complementou o deputado mineiro.\nJá o deputado Eduardo Bolsonaro (PL-SP) criticou o fato dos seguranças de Moraes terem feito um \"pedido informal\" ao órgão do TSE para acessar dados da polícia de São Paulo. \"Essa ferramenta \"pedido informal\" não caiu no meu concurso da PF. Mas pelo visto no concurso dos PFs do destacamento de Moraes (Stasi) caiu\", escreveu.\nAs novas revelações contra Moraes também foram criticadas pelo deputado Luiz Philippe de Orléans e Bragança (PL-SP). \"Os juízes de VERDADE (aqueles concursados de carreira, com ampla experiência prática de juiz) estão satisfeitos em ver os juízes FAKE (aqueles nomeados por criminosos) jogar todo o sistema judiciário na lama?\", escreveu.\nPara o deputado Marcel van Hatten (Novo-RS), o caso vem sendo chamado de \"Abin Paralela de Xandinho\".\nVeja Também:\nCármen defende Moraes e diz que é um “grande ex-presidente” do TSE\nX divulga novos pedidos sigilosos de Moraes contra contas da direita e Musk reage: “Loucura”\n“Senado não pode permanecer de joelhos a uma tirania do judiciário”, diz Portinho Apelo ao impeachment de Moraes Após o vazamento das mensagens sobre a atuação de Moraes, vários parlamentares começaram a se mobilizar em busca do processo de impeachment do ministro.\nDe acordo com o deputado Sargento Gonçalves (PL-RN), \"o escândalo expõe a perversidade da perseguição política\". \"Exige-se a anulação de todos os atos praticados por ele e, em seguida, o seu impeachment. Precisamos dar uma resposta firme à população brasileira e restaurar a credibilidade da Justiça no país.\", disse.\nNa mesma linha, o deputado Rodrigo Valadares (União-SE) destacou que “o conteúdo exibido é um caso que não apenas justifica um pedido de impeachment, mas também a anulação de todos os atos de Alexandre de Moraes enquanto presidente do TSE e responsável por inquéritos como o das fake news.\"\nNesta quarta-feira (14), um grupo de parlamentares lançou uma campanha nacional pelo impeachment de Moraes. Eles elencaram 13 motivos contra o magistrado para justificar o processo.\nNovas revelações violam poder de polícia do TSE As informações reveladas nesta quinta fazem parte de uma série de matérias da Folha de S. Paulo, sobre supostas tratativas do gabinete de Moraes no STF e a AEED no TSE para elaboração de relatórios sobre a atuação de jornalistas, deputados e apoiadores do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro nas redes sociais, entre agosto de 2022 e maio de 2023.\nAinda na terça-feira (13), após a primeira reportagem , o gabinete de Moraes defendeu sua atuação. Em nota, a equipe de Moraes disse que seus procedimentos “foram oficiais, regulares e estão devidamente documentados nos inquéritos e investigações em curso no STF, com integral participação da Procuradoria-Geral da República”.\nEm sessão do STF nesta quarta-feira (14), Moraes disse que seria \"esquizofrênico\" se \"auto-oficiar\" ao justificar pedidos de informações ao TSE, ao se referir sobre os relatórios solicitados à AEED que posteriormente embasaram decisões do ministro no STF.\nVeja Também:\nQuem são os juízes e o servidor que auxiliaram Moraes em decisões de censura\nBarroso diz que alegações contra Moraes são “tempestade fictícia” e STF é “transparente”",
