    "title": "K-State veterinary staff recognized for excellent work in teaching and research - Kansas State Collegian",
    "text": "Two Kansas State faculty members from the College of Veterinary Medicine received the Iman Outstanding Faculty Award in November, a $5,000 prize for excellence in teaching or research.\nDerek Mosier, department head for diagnostic medicine and pathobiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine, said Ron and Rae Iman, in partnership with the K-State Alumni Association, hand out the award yearly to recognize faculty “that go above and beyond in their area of discipline.”\nLisa M. Pohlman, professor of clinical pathology, received the award for teaching, and Waithaka Mwangi, professor of diagnostic medicine and pathobiology, received the award for research.\n“That’s one of my major passions, is teaching the vet students,” Pohlman said. “So … what clinical pathology is, basically it’s a lot of looking at bloodwork, urinalysis, you know, it’s the data.”\nPohlman said she realized she wanted to pursue education during her residency at Auburn University from 2004-2007.\n“When I went into my residency, I really thought that I would just go into diagnostics,” Pohlman said. “… I think I realized then how much I enjoyed teaching and watching the metamorphosis of students as they come into the program and grow, and their vocabulary changes and they become doctors, and their confidence grows — just watching all that is really rewarding when you’ve been part of teaching it.”\nMosier nominated Pohlman for the Iman Award.\n“She’s very student-centered,” Mosier said. “She wants to build a learning environment that helps them to do the best that they can. She spends whatever time is necessary to try to help them understand and, again, just creates a great learning environment. She’s demanding but fair, and she makes it clear what she expects, and students want to try to reach that because they respect her greatly, and her efforts to help them learn in clinical pathology.”\nPohlman said her love for animals also influences her teaching strategy.\n“I am really wanting to make sure that we have great care for animals and part of that is teaching our veterinarians, our students. I’m also the president and medical director of the Riley County Humane Society. That’s not associated with K-State, but it’s all sort-of part-and-parcel of caring for animals.”\nMosier said Pohlman’s passion reflects in her students’ success.\n“It makes it important,” Mosier said. “When a faculty member goes in and they’re excited about what they teach, I think that helps the students get excited. They realize that it’s an important topic, it’s worth knowing, and I think it’s a bit infectious. Her classrooms are upbeat, positive, very caring environments.”\nMosier also nominated Mwangi for the Iman award, who conducts research to find better ways to immunize livestock and humans.\n“We focus on several main diseases of interest,” Mwangi said. “The primary one that is of interest to us is … a very big virus. If you take COVID, for example, and compare it to the virus we’re working on, which is called African Swine Fever, [it’s] about 10 times much bigger, 10 times, even, more complicated.”\nMwangi said African Swine Fever only affects pigs.\n“There’s several strains, but the most lethal one kills pigs within about five to 12 days,” Mwangi said. “The clinical outcomes, to put it in a layman’s language, are similar to what Ebola causes in humans. … It’s a tick-transmitted virus that tends to be present in wild hogs, bush pigs, but it doesn’t kill all animals. What happens is when bush pigs, or wild hogs, comes in contact with a domestic pig, the virus can be transmitted by contact or even waste from an infected animal.”\nMwangi said the virus is endemic in Africa and continues to spread to other continents via human carriers. The main focus of his research is to develop a vaccine that will prevent an outbreak of African Swine Fever in the United States.\n“If there is an outbreak in the United States, it will actually have a huge economic impact,” Mwangi said. “Number one, United States is the leading pork exporter. … Even a single incident would jeopardize that market at the global level. … The pork industry is also a huge customer of various products, including grains and supplements, so the jobs created within the pork industry would also be jeopardized.”\nMwangi said he must observe every element of the virus’ makeup during his research.\n“The struggle here is that given the complexity of the virus, it’s not easy to make a vaccine because we don’t know even what it takes to really confirm effective protection. So that’s where we are at, looking at all the proteins, all the pieces in the virus. I’m asking the question: Which one of those could be protective?”\nMosier said Mwangi’s adaptability qualified him for the Iman Award.\n“He’s very creative, innovative, kind of a visionary researcher,” Mosier said. “He anticipates problems and then uses the tools and skills that he has to try to address them.”\nMosier said Mwangi’s research has positive effects not only on pigs but also on the world as a whole.\n“He works on domestic diseases, global transboundary disease, mainly production animals, but he’s working on projects for cancer in animals and things like that as well,” Mosier said. “So, he applies his skills across a wide variety of topics and is very dedicated to it. He runs high-quality [research], he’s very precise and just an excellent researcher.”",

    "text": "Reuters\nFILE PHOTO: NVIDIA logo is seen near computer motherboard in this illustration taken January 8, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n(Reuters) - Nvidia on Thursday criticized a reported plan by the Joe Biden administration to impose new restrictions on AI chip exports, saying that the outgoing U.S. leader should not \"preempt incoming President Trump\" by enacting a last-minute policy.\n\"We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries,\" Nvidia Vice President Ned Finkle said in an emailed statement.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment outside regular business hours.\nReuters reported exclusive details last month on the Commerce Department's plan for approving global AI chip exports while also preventing bad actors from accessing them. A key aim of the restrictions is to keep AI from supercharging China's military capabilities.\nBloomberg News reported on Thursday that new export regulations could be announced soon, adding that a group of U.S. adversaries would effectively get blocked from importing these chips, while the vast majority of the world would face limits on the total computing power that can go to one country.\nNvidia's Finkle said the reported policy was disguised as an \"anti-China move\" and warned that the extreme country cap will affect computers around the world and push the world to alternative technologies.\n\"This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,\" Finkle said.\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, representing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, has said the rule would place arbitrary constraints on U.S. companies' ability to sell computing systems overseas and cede the global market to competitors.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, in his first term in office, imposed restrictions on the sale of U.S. technology to China citing national security. Trump's second term begins on Jan. 20.\nNvidia shares were down more than 1% during extended trading on Thursday after the Bloomberg report.\n(Reporting by Devika Nair and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala)\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters .\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: artificial intelligence , United States",

    "title": "Pa. House Republicans boo Capitol officers, say their visit was politicizing Jan. 6",
    "text": "HARRISBURG — As the Pennsylvania House of Representatives recognized two police officers Wednesday who defended the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, several House Republicans booed or walked off the floor in protest and at least one state official yelled “traitor” at the men.\nLawmakers routinely bring special guests with them to be recognized, such as a local sports team that won a state championship, a school club, or a civic association. House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D., Philadelphia) typically reads the list of visitors, and House members applaud.\nAdvertisement That wasn’t the case, when the two U.S. Capitol police officers visited Wednesday.\nThe officers — Harry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell — stopped in Harrisburg as they traveled the state in support of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Both officers testified before the U.S. House’s Jan. 6th Select Committee about how they were treated during the riot.\nAs McClinton introduced Dunn and Gonell as having “bravely defended democracy” from rioters, a handful of Republican members left the floor while others stayed in the room but made their objections known, Democratic members said.\nIt was not clear from video footage of the proceedings who walked out or booed, because the video does not show the full House chamber.\nSeveral Democrats said they saw far-right State Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R., Clinton) yell “traitor” at the men. Borowicz could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.\n“There are folks, for whatever reason, decided instead of standing and honoring the heroic action of these former officers, they decided to walk away,” said Rep. Jordan Harris (D., Philadelphia). “The fact is, yesterday, they turned their backs on the blue.”\nThe Biden campaign released a statement from the officers.\n“The fact they’re scared to listen to those of us who were there and witnessed the political violence of January 6 first hand speaks volumes,” Dunn said.\nHouse Republican Minority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster), who can be seen standing to applaud the officers alongside other Republicans on the video recording of the session, said in a statement that bringing the two officers to the House after a campaign event was inappropriate. He noted that the House Democratic Campaign Committee had then sought to fundraise off the incident.\n“The PA House Democrats’ good will in this situation is suspect as they immediately used their politicized actions in the House chamber to fundraise for their campaign coffers,” Cutler added. “Unfortunately, they have, through House processes, demonstrated a pattern of antagonizing members and inviting division and discord for their political and campaign purposes.”\nDemocrats took control of the state House in 2023 for the first time in 12 years, and hold a one-seat majority. They’re hoping to hold onto control in the November general election, in which all 203 seats are on the ballot. Republicans hope to reclaim the majority.\nRep. Mike Schlossberg (D., Lehigh) claimed that House Republicans, when they controlled the chamber, would recognize their own political figures, and Democrats did not have the same reaction.\n“I find it very interesting that Republicans are saying we’re politicizing the issue of Jan. 6,” Schlossberg added. “If they perceive an attack on democracy as an attack on the Republican Party, perhaps their policies are out of line with democracy.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement",

Ramadan, a period of fasting in Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Islamic faith, moves in line with the moon each year. This year, it overlaps with Holy Week and Eastertide and appears to be taking precedence over them, despite the United Kingdom’s status as a [constitutionally](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/05/06/king-charless-coronation-shows-christianity-is-still-the-cornerstone-of-traditional-western-culture/) Christian country. London’s Ramadan displays, now in their second year, adorn the key locations in the West End, including Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Oxford Street. Khan, of the left-wing Labour Party, personally switched on the lights earlier this month. The choice of decoration, funded by the Aziz Foundation set up by billionaire property magnate Asif Aziz, has drawn [criticism](https://humanevents.com/2024/03/28/london-features-happy-ramadan-lights-throughout-city-over-easter-weekend) from some Conservatives. “The thing I would question is this: there has been a Ramadan celebration in the window of Westminster city hall. But I just wonder if the Easter one is going up very soon? Easter is one of the most important Christian festivals of the year but what are [the Labour-run municipal government] doing to celebrate it?” he asked. “I am not aware they are. I suspect the window display is not going to change.” Some have also noted the Ramadan decorations are going up at a time when London is gripped by anti-Israel protests every weekend, with some featuring open calls for [jihad](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/10/23/cops-defend-muslims-demanding-jihad-in-london/).

Our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Rabbi Dr. Josh Joseph and his daughter Marsha were among 400 runners representing OU Israel, as members of Team Yachad. An avid marathoner who runs the equivalent of a half marathon every Sunday when he is not traveling, Josh has completed a number of half marathons and three full ones, including the New York City Marathon in November, which he ran with his son Ozzie. Now in Israel on an OU board mission — his third trip to the country since October 7 — we chatted with Josh about his Jerusalem Winner Marathon experience and feelings about being in Israel at such a challenging time for the Jewish people. As Israel and the nation are still reeling from the effects of October 7, what did it mean to you to participate in the Jerusalem Winner Marathon together with thousands of fellow Jews? Josh: It’s a complicated time to think about “play”. For example, several prominent rabbis have emphasized that this isn’t the time to take a vacation. But the notion of 40,000 runners uniting together with all of the people cheering us on, created a true feeling of amcha. There were so many runners that we were literally running on top of one another. I participated in the half marathon and that was packed, and I heard the 10k was even more crowded. Everyone was just encouraging each other and it was all smiles everywhere. It felt like everyone was running together, not away from something, but for something. Fortunately I have experienced that to some extent before because I’ve run on behalf of tzedakah organizations previously. But this was different. The feeling after the race was equally wonderful. I walked back from Gan Sacher where the race began and ended, to my hotel. All along the way, people who had completed the race were beaming. In the hotel elevator, there was a fellow Israeli runner and she just wanted to share her experience with me — we stayed there for a while! The uplifting feeling of connection permeated the event before, during, and especially after. It impacted me tremendously. Could you elaborate on what you mean by running “for” something? Josh: I ran the Jerusalem Winner Marathon for a couple of purposes: one was as part of Team Yachad. I attended the pre-marathon party at the OU Israel Center in Jerusalem with 170 others and the energy was fantastic. From there, I went to NCSY’s pre-marathon party at Nefesh B’Nefesh’s Jerusalem Aliyah Campus, along with more than 70 Anglo olim teens. During some brief remarks I mentioned that I was going to run the half marathon. An Israeli-Canadian who was just released from active duty in Gaza, named Eliav Sabban, suggested we run together. The day of the race, I thought we’d start running together and then he would take off on his own. But he stayed with me the entire time. He would run ahead, get a water bottle, and bring it back to me. He kept looking over his shoulder to make sure that I was okay. He took care of me and I had only just met him the day before. This was the first year that all runners representing the OU wore an OU Israel logo somewhere on their shirts. I give a lot of kudos to NCSY Israel Director of Regional Development Gaby Novick, Yachad Israel Director of Development Yoel Sterman, Yachad Israel Director Sima Kelner, OU Israel Executive Director Rabbi Avi Berman, Chief Operating Officer Natan Kandler, who ran the 10K, Director of Marketing Laya Bejell, and Director of Human Resources Sara Berelowitz, who all came to cheer everyone on. Over 400 OU Israel representatives were at the race and we really felt like we were all part of the OU family. There’s a theory that I like to share that cites the three B’s of religious experience: the first is Belief or Bitachon. The second is Behavior; doing mitzvos and chessed, and learning Torah. The third “B”, which people sometimes overlook, is Belonging. When you belong to a community, you feel that you belong to something larger than yourself, deeper, more meaningful. At a micro level, I experienced that at the marathon as a member of Team Yachad. On a macro level, I felt a sense of belonging when running alongside 40,000 others. To live these moments with people coming together and running for something is a bracha, a Shehecheyanu. The second reason I ran was in memory of 26-year-old Sergeant first class (res.) Yakir Hexter, hy”d, of the Combat Engineering Corps’ 8219th Battalion, who fell in Gaza in January. I am very close with his parents Josh and Chaya. The shirt I wore in Yakir’s memory said “Born to Run ” on it, which is a theme based on a book about running barefoot; Yakir ran the half marathon barefoot. I took off my shoes for a moment, but his younger brother Ezra ran the entire 10K barefoot in Yakir’s honor. Many runners sported “Born to Run” shirts, many ran for people in captivity, and many ran for those who, lo aleinu, have lost their lives in the last five months. We all ran for something. At a Siyum, we say, “Anu ratzim v’hem ratzim — They are running and we are running.” We’re running l’chaye olam haba, for a higher purpose. I believe that was the mindset of many of the participants — that we were running for a higher purpose. As a member of Team Yachad, why do you believe Yachad’s participation in the marathon was so important — both for participants and spectators? One of Yachad’s key goals is to foster inclusion. Beyond just making a Yachad participant or family member feel seen, inclusion means working with the community to become a more embracing place where everybody feels that they belong. That was the feeling with Team Yachad, where both participants and advisors were part of the same community. Many of the 319 Team Yachad runners were first- and second-year yeshiva and seminary students and that was an incredible statement not only for our present, but also our future. It was not only a testament to Yachad’s hard work in getting people involved and excited about the cause; it also spoke to participants’ declaration that, “This cause and these people matter to me. I want to be part of this community.” When you extend Yachad’s values to NCSY and the OU in Israel, and then to the broader OU in North America, those concentric circles reverberate and are felt by the entire Jewish community. You not only increased your fundraising goal from the typical $2,200 to $5,000; you raised $7,161! Do you have a message for everyone who supported you? To everyone who supported me, whether financially or through well-wishes, every time you smile at someone, you give them a bit of yourself. Every time you support someone, you become closer to them. I felt everyone’s presence, love, warmth and part in this community — even those who could not be with me physically. Actually, I could have used a bit more of their help running up the steep incline of Kovshei Katamon street at Kilometer 18 — I had reached a personal record pace until that hill and Hashem wanted other things! But seriously, I felt everyone’s support and am grateful to them all. I invite them to come run with me next year!",

    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

While filming one of the episodes of the new season of Law & Order , the little girl approached Mariska asking for help.\nWitnesses reported that the girl got separated from her mother while they were at the playground in Fort Tryon Park, and she didn’t even realize that the filming crew was in the middle of a scene, nor did she notice Mariska’s co-star Ice-T in her search for help, as she went straight to Hargitay.\nFortunately, the story had a happy ending thanks to the quick actions taken by the Law & Order team, as well as Mariska, to find the lost little girl’s mother.

    "text": "Representative Image | screengrab: mathrubhumi news Kochi: As the Christian community in Kerala observed Maundy Thursday, a priest from the influential Syro Malabar Catholic Church embraced inclusivity by washing the feet of women during the ceremony held at his parish in Ernakulam district. Inspired by Pope Francis's call to include everyone, Father James Panavelil not only washed the feet of women but also kissed them afterward. The washing-of-the-feet ceremony on Maundy Thursday is a re-enactment of Jesus washing the feet of his 12 disciples during the Last Supper and it is performed by a senior member of the clergy during mass on the Thursday before Easter Sunday. Father Panavelil said the washing of women's feet had been done in the past, but later the senior priests of the Syro Malabar Church had obtained an exemption saying it was not part of our tradition and the practice was stopped. \"However, we should not treat someone as beneath us. Everyone is equal. So I did it to spread that message,\" he said after performing the ceremony at the Sanjopuram St. Joseph's Church here. Father Panavelil said there were no records of the same being practised in the past, but he was sure it was done earlier. \"In present times, this may be the first instance here (Syro Malabar Church),\" he told PTI. The influential Syro-Malabar Church is the largest Eastern Catholic Church after the Ukrainian Church. On being asked if there were any disagreements within the church or diocese regarding the new practice, Father Panavelil denied it. \"No one saw it as a negative. Everyone accepted it positively. Lot of our senior members of the clergy are supporting it. It is a good thing. There is nothing negative about it. I have not come across any disagreement regarding it. Everyone has appreciated it. \"All that was required was someone to be courageous to take the first step. Basically, we all believe in equality. This was something that was long overdue,\" he said. Pope Francis called for this in 2014-15 and he has washed the feet of people from all walks of life including transgenders and physically challenged persons, Father Panavelil said. \"It was a progressive step from his side,\" he said. Father Panavelil said he was interested in doing it last year, but the church authorities were not in favour of it back then. \"This time there have been no problems till now,\" he said. The Latin Church, which is in communion with the Roman Catholic Church headed by the Pope, has decided to include women in its liturgical ceremony. The participation of women in the ritual became a topic of discussion after Pope Francis washed the feet of female inmates of a juvenile detention centre in Rome in 2013, and followed it up with a papal decree in December 2014 calling for the inclusion of \"all people of God\", including women and people from other religions, in the ritual.
