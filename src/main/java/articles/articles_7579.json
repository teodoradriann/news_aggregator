    "text": "Independence activist Tony Chung is pictured in a street in Hong Kong, China January 8, 2019. Picture taken January 8, 2019. REUTERS/James Pomfret/File Photo Reuters\nBy Kanishka Singh\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail.\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison.\nKEY QUOTES\nThe trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of \"immense pressure and fear,\" compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper.\nChung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory \"deradicalization\" program in detention.\nGuards \"kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,\" Chung was quoted as saying. \"We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn't disagree or argue back.\"\nChung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, \"just as before.\"\nCONTEXT\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: United States , Hong Kong , United Kingdom , Europe\nRead More",

    "text": "Savanah Nicole Soto, a pregnant teenager who disappeared before she was scheduled to be induced, is believed to have been found dead Tuesday following a dayslong search, police said. Her boyfriend was also found dead, police confirmed Wednesday. The two bodies were discovered in a vehicle in San Antonio, the city's police chief, Bill McManus, told reporters Tuesday evening, calling the case \"very, very perplexing.\" \"Detectives right now are looking at this as a possible murder, but we don't know for sure,\" McManus said. The bodies of an 18-year-old woman and 22-year-old man were found in a parked vehicle, each with a gunshot wound, police said Wednesday. An unborn child was also found deceased, police said. The medical examiner positively identified the male victim as Matthew Guerra, police said Wednesday night. Police are awaiting positive identification for the female victim. The victims' cause of death will be confirmed by the medical examiner, police said. They are believed to have been in the boyfriend's vehicle for three to four days, McManus said. The vehicle was found on the 5900 block of Danny Kaye Drive in northwest San Antonio, police said. McManus did not know who located it. Soto, 18, was last seen Friday afternoon in Leon Valley, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The agency issued a CLEAR Alert -- used to help law enforcement locate someone in imminent danger or whose disappearance is involuntary -- for Soto on Monday. The pregnant teen had passed her delivery date, which \"caused significant concern among her family members after missing an essential medical appointment,\" the Leon Valley Police Department said in a press release earlier on Tuesday. Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT that her daughter was scheduled to be induced at a hospital this past Saturday. \"When I called her all morning she wasn't answering, was going straight to voicemail,\" Cordova told the station. \"We went to the hospital anyways. She was a no-show, and that's when I called the cops.\" Cordova said her daughter's home was clean and had been prepped for the baby's arrival. \"This is not like her,\" Cordova told KSAT. \"She was so excited to have this baby. The house was already baby-ready.\" \"There's no reason why she would just get up and go off and do that,\" she added. Cordova said the family is already reeling after her son, Ethan, died last year. The 15-year-old was fatally shot at his home in San Antonio, police said. \"[Savanah] knows what I went through with Ethan, and I know she doesn't want me to go through this again,\" the mother told KSAT. Amid the search for her daughter, Cordova said she did not know where the father of the baby was either. \"I just want her home,\" Cordova said. \"I'm worried about the baby, if she's even had the baby, if she's in danger.\" The Leon Valley Police Department said Tuesday morning that it was actively investigating Soto's disappearance and seeking additional witnesses and information. The San Antonio Police Department has taken over the investigation.",

    "text": "Sponsored Post The recent Sisense breach , - where attackers exfiltrated customer data after discovering hardcoded AWS credentials in GitLab repositories - serves as yet another stark reminder: hardcoded secrets remain a primary attack vector.\nWith AI coding assistants now routinely suggesting potentially insecure code patterns, the risk has only increased. GitGuardian, known for its secrets detection and remediation platform, is tackling this challenge where it starts - in the developer's IDE. The company's new VS Code extension aims to catch secrets before they reach version control, saving time for both developers and application security teams.\nThe extension operates by scanning code as developers type, highlighting potential secrets directly in the editor. When detected, developers receive immediate feedback through IDE notifications and inline highlights - no need to switch tools or wait for CI/CD pipelines to fail.\nKey capabilities include:\n- Real-time secrets scanning powered by GitGuardian's detection engine.\n- Guided remediation with actionable fix suggestions.\n- False positive management through gitguardian.yaml configuration.\n- One-click installation with no additional dependencies.\n- Built-in support for air-gapped environments.\nWhile pre-commit hooks have been the traditional first line of defense, they can be bypassed or forgotten during setup. The VS Code extension provides an earlier, more consistent security checkpoint that's always active.\nStudies show that better developer awareness alone can reduce exposed secrets by up to 20 percent. By catching issues at the source, the extension helps teams avoid the difficult compromise between security and productivity when revocating a secret that was accidentally exposed.\nAs more developers rely on AI coding assistants, the risk of inadvertently introducing secrets increases. The extension acts as a safety net, detecting potentially dangerous suggestions before they make it into production code.\nThe tool is open-source and available on GitHub, allowing security teams to verify its operation and contribute improvements. It's designed to work alongside existing security measures like pre-commit hooks and GitGuardian's broader platform, providing defense-in-depth against secret exposure.\nDon't wait for a breach to improve your secrets management. Start protecting your code where it's written.\nClick here to get the GitGuardian VS Code extension now.\nSponsored by GitGuardian.",

SUSCRÍBETE VER MÁS SECCIONES Diario QueTal Negocios Salud Ciencia y Tecnología Autos y Motos Moda y belleza Cultura y entretenimiento Viajes y Gastronomía Estilo de vida nacionales Auroras boreales podrían verse hoy jueves en estos estados de México Excélsior | 10/10/2024 | 20:24 La tormenta solar que ataca a la Tierra este jueves ha provocado la aparición de las primeras auroras boreales en Europa, que podrían presentarse también en Canadá, Estados Unidos e incluso México . Según SkyAlert, servicio que alerta de manera temprana los sismos, así como múltiples peligros naturales, exista una posibilidad de que los estados norteños de la República observen este tipo de fenómenos luminosos , aunque esto dependerá de un buen ojo fotográfico. De acuerdo al Space Weather Predicion Center de la NOAA, se pronostica una tormenta geomagnética G4 (severa) que estaría generando auroras en latitudes medias y bajas durante el 10 y 11 de octubre. En México podrían ser \"visibles\" en estados del norte, pero mediante fotografías de larga exposición”, indicó. En otra publicación, SkyAlert precisó que las auroras boreales podrían verse esta misma noche de jueves en latitudes medias a bajas, por lo que recomendó preparar cámaras. Pese a que la tormenta solar es severa, se espera que no tenga semejanza con la acontecida el pasado mes de mayo de este año, cuando aparecieron auroras boreales en gran parte de territorio mexicano, efecto que no es nada común. ¿Cuáles son los estados del norte de México? La Región Norte de México la constituyen las siguientes entidades federativas: Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Sonora y Tamaulipas. ¿Qué son las auroras boreales? La Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), las define como un fenómeno luminoso de la alta atmósfera, que surge luego de la entrada de partículas del viento solar (principalmente electrones), por las líneas del campo magnético terrestre, que estimulan los átomos y las moléculas del aire produciendo luz en el proceso. Las auroras boreales pueden ser de diferentes colores, por ejemplo, las de color verdes y rojas tienen estimulación de partículas de oxígeno, mientras que las rosas, de nitrógeno, y las azules o moradas, de hidrógeno y helio. Por lo general ocurren cerca de los polos magnéticos de la Tierra, donde las líneas del campo magnético de nuestro planeta son casi verticales.

This is typically a choice made by a supervisor after the movie script has been created.\nFrom Gulzar To Javed Akhtar Tracing The Evolution Of Bollywood Lyrics Through Eras\nBut what is a screenwriter to do when they wish to consist of songs in their spec script?\nThey need to be mindful of exactly how their choice might impact a producer's reaction to their job.\nPersonality Evaluation\nA personality evaluation is similar to a plot analysis, however focuses on a private personality. This serves for identifying specific qualities and attributes of personalities that might not be noticeable to the viewers. In addition, a character analysis can help to highlight exactly how a character modifications throughout the job.\nTo execute a personality evaluation, the pupil must have whatever work they are analyzing available. They ought to read the work several times and keep in mind. This includes highlighting essential aspects, such as personality interactions and styles.\nThe primary step in character analysis is to determine the character's function and role in the tale. The pupil needs to after that take a look at how that character develops throughout the narrative and how that change is reflected in their interactions with various other characters. The following action is to establish whether the personality is fixed or dynamic. Static characters stay unchanged throughout the tale, while vibrant personalities alter substantially. This is typically shown in the struggle or conflict they encounter.\nTextual Evaluation\nWhether you're evaluating poetry for a literary works course, a speech in interactions or history, a clinical journal post for a research paper, or any other type of message, it's vital to understand what you're taking a look at. The most effective evaluations start with a summary and context, declaration of intent, evidence, and the big picture.\nDepending on the context of your evaluation, your proof may consist of primary resources (the text you're analyzing), various other texts related to it, or write-ups or reviews created near its very first publication day. Stay clear of citing individuals's point of views as assistance for your thesis, unless they're objective and sensible.\nImaginary job is much more complex than nonfiction, so you'll require to unpack not simply the personalities and story yet a whole fictional fact as well.

Like script, track lyrics are abundant in drama and feeling that can bring a music to life.\nWhen carrying out a track you want to make sure you understand who your personality is talking to and why they are claiming what they are saying. It's likewise vital to know your personalities physical and emotional state.\nUtilizing strategies from the acting school of Konstantin Stanislavski (together with the job of Sanford Meisner) you can break down a song into a character-based talk, called a \"songalogue.\" This technique enables stars to discover the world of the tune via a combination of conventional text-based evaluation and psychophysical approaches to acting.\nFinal Draft\nEnvision taking a seat and writing a tune easily, throughout on a clean white notebook web page. This hardly ever happens, however! Instead, a lot of tracks go through multiple drafts and modifications to obtain where they require to be. This is a terrific possibility to trying out different rhyme schemes, discover new links that have meaning and make the song better overall.\nIf you are stuck for lyric ideas, try some timed free writing or looking up nouns, verbs, or adjectives in a thesaurus. In some cases a vibrant word or expression can stimulate originalities that have actually never ever struck you in the past.\nIt is necessary for aiming film writers to bear in mind that songs is not simply history noise in a motion picture. As a matter of fact, it can be among one of the most vital devices for establishing mood and telling a story. With this in mind, it's important for songwriters to learn how to write lyrics and tunes that can function well with a manuscript and aid bring personalities and tales to life on display.",

    "title": "La camorra in ospedale a Napoli: «Qui certificati falsi»",
    "text": "Una fabbrica di falsi incidenti stradali. Per anni è stato anche questo l’ospedale San Giovanni Bosco, al netto delle inchieste (tre in pochi anni) e delle verifiche amministrative. Nell’ospedale di via Briganti, c’era un mercato: quello delle false perizie, grazie a tac e a radiografie tecnicamente vere, ma posticce. In che senso? Appartenevano a cartelle cliniche di pazienti realmente passati per il presidio sanitario, ma venivano rubate e incollate nelle richieste di risarcimento del danno da presentare alle compagnie di assicurazione, per giustificare l’esistenza di sinistri di fatto mai avvenuti. Succede (o succedeva) al San Giovanni Bosco, ospedale su cui torna ad esprimersi il presidente della regione Vincenzo De Luca, che - nel corso della diretta social ieri - ha ricordato l’importanza del blitz dei carabinieri culminato in undici arresti: «Un passo in avanti, ma la battaglia deve continuare». Ha spiegato il governatore: «C’è stato un passo in avanti, la battaglia deve continuare nel corso degli anni. Esprimiamo intanto apprezzamento per il lavoro fatto e per il lavoro di contrasto a organizzazioni criminali. Quello che è mancato in queste ore è ricordare che la battaglia alla camorra è condotta dalla Regione Campania dal 2016, va ricordato che nel dicembre 2018 c’è stata la mia prima richiesta di istituzione di un posto di polizia al San Giovanni Bosco, al Prefetto Carmela Pagano, richiesta rinnovata a giugno 2019, poi a gennaio 2020, nel frattempo abbiamo cacciato le presenze camorristiche, quelli che gestivano il bar senza averne titolo, quello che avevano istituito un parcheggio in un’area pubblica. Si è fatto un lavoro straordinario, riproporremo le immagini del direttore dell’Asl Napoli 1, Ciro Verdoliva, che ha caricato materialmente le strutture del bar eliminato tra le minacce dei gestori. C’è alle spalle un lavoro di anni per la legalità e la pulizia», ha concluso De Luca. Il retroscena Inchiesta condotta dai pm della Procura di Napoli Alessandra Converso e Daniela Varone, sotto il coordinamento dell’aggiunto Sergio Ferrigno, la figura centrale dell’ultima inchiesta si chiama Gennaro Menetta, al secolo Maradona. Al momento Menetta è irreperibile, non è stato raggiunto dalle manette firmate dal gip Federica Colucci. Un passato da consigliere della municipalità, in organico in una ditta delle pulizie operativa per anni al San Giovanni Bosco, secondo i pentiti “Maradona” faceva il bello e il cattivo tempo a proposito dei reperti medici. Agli atti i nomi di medici e professionisti (che oggi non lavorano più al San Giovanni Bosco), le verifiche continuano per fronteggiare un fenomeno che sembra radicato da tempo all’ombra dei nostri presìdi sanitari. Qualche anno fa, la fabbrica dei falsi sinistri fu il titolo assegnato al Loreto Mare (anche qui, oggi ampia bonifica), mentre oggi si torna a parlare del San Giovanni Bosco. E spuntano rilievi e note che attestano anche precisi interventi di natura amministrativa. Di recente, è toccato al direttore della Asl Napoli uno Ciro Verdoliva sottoscrivere una nota che faceva riferimento proprio all’atteggiamento assunto in ospedale dall’ex addetto alle pulizie Manetta. Una nota nella quale il manager segnalava una frase dal sapore minaccioso («direttore, ma state sempre in questo ospedale?»), che è ovviamente finita al vaglio degli inquirenti della Dda di Napoli. Un caso che ora attende gli sviluppi investigativi, con i carabinieri del comando provinciale che danno la caccia all’ex consigliere e addetto alle pulizie, che «controllava il reparto di radiologia».",
