    "text": "Back in spring 2021, Eyewitness News\nshared the story of two sisters in Britain who were using TikTok to encourage other teens to read.\nMireille and Elodie Lee's\n\"A Life of Literature\" account has grown dramatically since then, and now they're stepping into the publishing business.\nThe Lee sisters' move to become publishers is all more remarkable when you consider Mireille is just 18 years old and Elodie recently turned 16.\nTogether they have found fame promoting the books they love on TikTok and now they are looking to deepen the connection with fans and broaden their reach.\n\"We've been building this audience together on TikTok and Instagram for a long time now,\" said Mireille to Eyewitness News entertainment reporter Sandy Kenyon.\n\"It's been an amazing experience. All of the offers that we have received have been unimaginable,\" said Elodie.\nThe sisters grew up close in Brighton, England.\n\"When we were little, we were obsessed with the library,\" said Mireille.\nThey took to TikTok early, starting \"A Life of Literature\" and encouraging their peers to read the books they love.\n\"And, our love of books is behind our new venture, Bindery,\" added Mireille.\nThe Lee sisters are part of a diverse group under the Bindery umbrella.\nBindery is the brainchild of Matt Kaye.\n\"When I saw what was happening with people like Mireille and Elodie on social media, like how many books they were selling and how passionate their audience was, I got really excited about this idea that they could do even more in the publishing world,\" Kaye said.\nHis new company is a place to interact directly with fans.\nWhat's even more exciting about the new venture is the opportunity for these influencers to become publishers.\n\"We get to give unpublished authors a bigger chance to get their books published because they're just as deserving as the other bigger authors in the industry, but they don't necessarily get that chance,\" said Elodie. \"So that's what Bindery is about and that's what everyone's trying to do on the platform.\"\nOnce a manuscript is accepted for publication, Bindery acts like a traditional publisher when it comes to editing and cover design and the like, but those who follow Mireille, Elodie and the others get to follow along as that process unfolds.\nReaders get to be a part of a book's journey to the point of sale.",

Aunque no afectará a los vuelos comerciales, supone otro revés para el gigante aeronáutico, cuya reputación y finanzas se han visto golpeadas este años por problemas de facturación y múltiples investigaciones federales.\nTe puede interesar Mueren dos personas al explotar un neumático de un Boeing en aeropuerto de Atlanta",

    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23.\nFédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released.\nEven though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\"\nThe union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks.\nThe FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike.\nEarlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days.\nThe only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing.\nEarlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break.\n\"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview.\nMartel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all.\n\"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

The debate also featured socialist leader Olivier Faure, discussing France's future amid rising social tensions. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Paris | Updated: 28-06-2024 02:28 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 02:28 IST - Country: - France French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Thursday accused his main challenger for the top job, Jordan Bardella, of tolerating racist speech in the ranks of his far-right camp amid a heated last television debate before the start of parliamentary elections. The debate between Attal, National Rally (RN) party chief Bardella and socialist leader Olivier Faure was the last direct confrontation of three radically opposed views on France's future before ballots open for the first voting round on Sunday. \"You can't build peace and unity when you present ... more than a hundred candidates who have been accused of making racist remarks\", Attal told Bardella, reading out press reports of the politicians using racial slurs. \"Each and every one of us must always be uncompromising with hate speech, because if we are not uncompromising, we end up legitimising it,\" he said. Bardella, whose party is leading in opinion polls and could emerge the dominant political power in the country for the first time, rebuffed the accusations, shouting \"This is false!\" at his adversary. \"I don't like this way of associating a pseudo-climate of hatred with the National Rally electorate\", Bardella said later in the debate. Reports of assaults motivated by race, homophobia and political allegiance in the run-up to the election has added to France's already tense social climate less then a month before Paris hosts the world for the Olympics. In an unexpected move earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament and called the election after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections. The outcome will be known after a second round of voting on July 7. Seeking to present his leftwing alliance, the New Popular Front, as an alternative to those opposing Macron's pro-business agenda without shifting to the right, Faure called for a change of wealth distribution. Citing recent protest movements over cost-of-living issues like the \"yellow vests\" and farmers, as well as anger over a recent raise of the retirement age, Faure said: \"It is possible to reject the idea that there are people who through all the crises manage to get richer and richer, while others ... struggle to make ends meet.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "Who Is Satish Kumar? Lakshmi Narayan Temple Chief Whose House Was Attacked In Canada Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Canada. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey, Canada. On Friday, at least 14 rounds were fired at his son's residence. This is the third time that the Lakshmi Narayan temple or its members have come under attack from Khalistan supporters. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Surrey. The attack is seen as a revenge attack over a protest held by the temple against Khalistani Extremist extremists. The counter-protest was organised against Khalistani extremists at this temple last month when they gathered to attack the temple premises. Speaking exclusively to Times Now, Satish Kumar said that the incident happened at his son's house and added that the police are investigating the matter at the moment. When asked about the possible suspect behind the attack, he said that he could not say anything at the moment. Speaking on the connection between this attack and the attack that took place on the temple, he said that it is not related and it could have been extortion. In August, the well-known Hindu temple in Canada’s British Columbia was vandalised with anti-India graffiti, drawing massive outrage within the Indian community. Khalistan referendum posters were also pasted on the main door of the temple at midnight, according to reports.

    "text": "Winter landscapes can be truly gorgeous, especially when snow is cascading down and the icy ground shimmers in the light. But let’s be honest, it’s a lot easier to enjoy these scenic landscapes when you’re not driving through treacherous road conditions. If you’d like to take in some snowy grandeur while remaining safe and warm, a winter train ride is the perfect solution. And if you need to travel during the winter — and have some extra time to do it at a more leisurely pace — one of these train rides could upgrade the experience to an exciting adventure. Amtrak Vermonter (between Washington, D.C. and St. Albans, Vermont) If, like Robert Frost, you like the idea of “stopping by woods on a snowy eventing,” then take a ride on the Vermonter. It departs from Union Station in Washington, D.C., then passes through nine states on its way to St. Albans, Vermont near the shore of Lake Champlain. The entire journey, which takes about 13 hours, will take you through both big cities and small New England towns. Take the trip during a snowy month and you’ll see a glistening white wooded landscape as you pass through cozy Vermont hamlets like Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Waterbury and Essex. It also stops near Camel’s Hump State Park in Montpelier, a majestic place for hiking. You can [book your trip on Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/vermonter-train). MORE: [This train ride stops in 37 cities on the way from New York to New Orleans](https://www.simplemost.com/train-ride-stops-37-cities-way-new-york-new-orleans/) Amtrak Coast Starlight (between Los Angeles and Seattle) The Coast Starlight, which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, is known for its observation cars (aka sightseer lounges), which provide gorgeous views through floor-to-ceiling windows. In other words, this is a train designed for sitting back and taking in the cinematic landscape. Anyone with a ticket has access to these cars, which are especially coveted as the train passes the town of Oxnard and hugs the coast for the next three hours. For the best views, try to get a seat on the left side of the train. The scenery in Oregon will also knock you out, as you wind through glistening forests, white-capped mountains and numerous lakes. The train leaves L.A. every day at 10 a.m. and arrives in Seattle 34 hours later, getting in at around 8 p.m. the next day. [Book tickets here](https://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train). Amtrak California Zephyr (between Chicago and San Francisco) The California Zephyr passes through seven states on its daily, 2,437-mile journey from Chicago to the San Francisco Bay Area. You can ride the train for just one portion of the trip or stick around for all 51 hours and 20 minutes. While the Zephyr will take you through some major cities (Omaha, Denver, Salt Lake City) and smaller ones (Naperville, Illinois, Lincoln, Nebraska, Glenwood Springs, Colorado), the main attraction here is the mountains. You’ll pass through both the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevadas, with stunning, wintry views you wouldn’t get if traveling by car. There’s also a cool, historical aspect to this train ride: You’ll pass over a stretch of hand-built railroad in the Sierras that was built during the Civil War as part of the transcontinental railroad route. [Book tickets here](https://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train). White Pass and Yukon Route Railway (between Skagway, Alaska, Fraser, British Columbia, Carcross, Yukon and Whitehorse, Yukon) Would you like a side dish of history as you gobble up spectacular views? Then head to the Alaskan seaport town of Skagway, and take one of the excursions on the White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad. (The White Pass Summit Excursion is the most popular. The 40-mile trip takes about three hours.) This historic railroad, which was built in the late 1800s during the Gold Rush, features vintage parlor cars. One of them (the car named Lake LeBerge) carried Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to Whitehorse during their tour of Canada and the United States in 1959. Of course, the main attraction is the stunning views as the train climbs 3,000 feet past gorges, waterfalls and glacial rivers. For the best views on the way up, sit on the left side of the car.

The two forks meet in Spokane, Washington and go on to Chicago’s Union Station, passing through seven states in total. From Seattle, it’s a 2,255-mile journey and from Portland, it’s 2,205 miles. You can ride the whole line or get on and off at dozens of stops along the route, but the whole excursion would take you about 46 hours to complete. Along the way, you’ll take in the raw beauty and picturesque charm of snow-spackled woods, icy rivers and magnificent mountain ranges. There’s not a bad seat on this train, with Glacier National Park on the left and the Flathead National Forest on the right. [Book tickets here](https://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train).

You’ll also have a 60-minute layover at Cascade Canyon, where you can eat lunch by a roaring fire and walk along the river. [Book tickets here](https://www.durangotrain.com/ride-us/). Amtrak Seattle and the Canadian Rockies Winter Discovery (between Seattle and Alberta, Canada) If you want to immerse yourself in a magical nine days of wintery exploration, this train trip from Seattle to Calgary will hit the spot. You’ll travel through the Canadian Rockies in areas where cars are prohibited, and there are incredible views of Vancouver from soaring heights. TikTok user Tiffany Lo captured the experience [in a video:](https://www.tiktok.com/@tlo.travels/video/7209701252610116910) [@tlo.travels]This is one of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen!

In refurbished vintage cars, you’ll travel 36 miles round-trip from Napa, California to St. Helena, California. You can choose between full-day and half-day options. Both offer views of Italian-inspired architecture and lush winery gardens. The full-day Legacy Experience is a 6-hour trip with gourmet lunch included, plus visits to two of Napa Valley’s most notable wineries, Charles Krug Winery and V. Sattui. The Grgich Hills Winery Tour also offers a gourmet lunch but stops at just one winery, where you’ll taste wine from the renowned winemaker Mike Grgich. At Christmastime, the Wine Train becomes the Santa Train. Families with kids ride the route with an emphasis on hot cocoa or cider rather than wine. Santa’s also aboard.

Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad (between Spooner and Springbrook, Wisconsin) The Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad is less about getting to a destination — and more about enjoying a unique sightseeing excursion. It travels along the Namekagon River for 15 miles between the towns of Spooner and Springbrook, all on a railroad track that was laid more than 100 years ago. There are lots of packages to choose from, including themes like “Family Pizza,” “Elegant Dinner” and “Bed & Breakfast.” During the holiday season, the railroad even puts a festive spin on their pizza train, as seen below in a Facebook post from the official [Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad](https://www.facebook.com/WIGNRR) page: You’ll be traveling anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the option you reserve. [Book tickets here](https://spoonertrainride.com/). Aurora Winter Train (between Anchorage and Fairbanks in Alaska) Why take a 12-hour, 350-mile train ride from Anchorage to Fairbanks, Alaska? Breathtaking winter landscapes and an excellent opportunity to glimpse the northern lights. The train leaves at 8:30 a.m. and arrives at around 8 p.m. But because of Alaska’s early sunsets (night begins at around 4 p.m. in January, for example), there’s plenty of time to gaze out of the picture windows to see the aurora borealis. You can also depart the train at one of its many stops to take in some winter activities like snowshoeing, snowmobiling or dog sledding. The train stops in Denali National Park & Preserve, where you can see the highest mountain peak in North America and maybe see some winter wildlife likes grizzlies and black bears.
