    "title": "Russia claims more territory in eastern Ukraine as civilians flee",
    "text": "Now, as the Ukrainian incursion continues in the Russian region of Kursk, thousands of Ukrainian civilians are ordered to flee in the face of advancing Russian troops. The city of Perkovsk in the east is not far from the Russian border and residents are giving up hope that they can remain. We can go across now to France 24&#039;s Gulliver Cragg as standing by Gulliver. Russian forces are quickly advancing near Perkovsk. What more do we know at this stage? Well, Prokofska, the beginning of this year, was the furthest Ukrainian held city in the eastern region of Donbass from the frontline. Now it&#039;s the closest. I think the Russians are at about 10 kilometers from the gates of the city. They&#039;re expanding the area of land that they control to the east and southeast of Prokofska, taking villages in that area. And there seems to be a widespread expectation in Ukraine that they will reach the city of Prokofska. And there are great fears that it will be very heavily bombarded soon. Been communicating via messages with the Ukrainian soldier who&#039;s defending in that direction. And he says that the Russian aviation is constantly bombing them with these glide bombs, forcing them to abandon their positions and retreat. And he was pretty pessimistic about the situation. He said it was extremely difficult. And he was a bit bitter about this operation in Kursk region in Russia, saying why weren&#039;t those military resources sent in our direction to help us defend Prokrovska instead of taking land in another country? The idea, of course, one of them is that the Russians will be forced to divert their own military resources to defend chorus region and that will make things a bit easier here being seen yet. But other soldiers I&#039;ve been speaking to in this region have said that it yet might they say that has industrial areas on the east of the city that constitute sort of natural defences, if you like for the Ukrainians. They can defend the city very well on the edge of the city, and perhaps the Russians will eventually run out of men, run out of strength to attack Prokrovsk. These were soldiers, though, who weren&#039;t fighting in the Prokrovsk area. They had actually just arrived from chassis Yah, another very important target for the Russians. Gulliver, you&#039;ve been speaking with soldiers on the ground in Donbass. What have they been telling you? So these soldiers was just had come from for a bit of rest and recuperation. They were extremely tired. And they described an absolutely hellish scene in Chasevyar where the Ukrainians for months now have been defending this small but strategically located hilltop town just to the West of Now the Russians haven&#039;t managed to cross the canal that runs on the eastern edge of the town. And these soldiers, despite the very difficult situation under constant bombardment with the Russians also dropping mines that then create even trip wise that they can drop from plane. So you have to be constantly looking down at your feet and up in the sky because of the drones. Despite this relentless bombardment, they said the Russians keep trying to storm the town, but they really just can&#039;t make it across the canal. They keep being forced back by the Ukrainians. And these soldiers at least seem pretty confident that Ukraine would be able to continue to defend Chasseviar. Gulliver, thank you very much for that, Gulliver. Craig reporting there.",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "PM Modi Outreach To Putin Helped Avert \"Potential Nuclear Attack\" On Ukraine In 2022: Report",
    "text": "US officials say that outreach from PM Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials. The report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis. The Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said. Amid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN. \"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said. US officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis. \"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying. \"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can't demonstrate this positively, but I think that's our assessment.\" Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India. During this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said. Notably, late summer 2022 was also proving a 'devastating period' for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia's biggest prize since the invasion. As these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN. Also, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack. In October 2022, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\" But, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

    "text": "La comida procesada es capaz de provocar más adicción que las drogas, y la industria lo sabe\nNicolás Fdez Darna\nCuando hablamos de adicción, se nos vienen a la cabeza imágenes de diferentes drogas como el tabaco, el alcohol o el cannabis. Pero difícilmente pensaremos en las chuches, las patatas fritas o las chocolatinas. Un nuevo libro del escritor Michael Moss nos demuestra que deberíamos empezar a tener este tipo de productos en cuenta.\nUna adicción es un vicio del que no podemos escapar y que nos va dañando con el tiempo, física o psicológicamente. Pero decir solo eso se quedaría muy corto.\nLa naturaleza adictiva no tiene tanto que ver con la sustancia que produce esa dependencia, sino con el cerebro y el cuerpo del individuo que se vuelve adicto. Hay muchas personas que fuman o beben alcohol y no son adictos, ya que no dependen de esas substancias.\nAdemás, los síntomas que genera una adicción no tienen por qué ser los mismos en diferentes personas. Determinadas adicciones no provocan un dolor interno o un «mono físico» evidente, sino que van más por dentro. Están en nuestra mente y puede que ni nos demos cuenta.\nY aquí es donde llegamos al verdadero quid de la cuestión: todas las adicciones se desarrollan en nuestro cerebro. De hecho, existe un elemento que influye de forma determinante en la naturaleza adictiva de una sustancia: el circuito de recompensa, que es la parte del cerebro que nos aporta placer ante determinado estímulo.\nCuanto más rápido llegue una sustancia a nuestro circuito de recompensa, mayor será su impacto en nuestro organismo. Por esa razón, una droga intravenosa estimula más que el cannabis, y fumar produce mayor sentimiento de recompensa que usar un parche de nicotina.\nLa comida basura, una gran adicción\nExiste algo que activa nuestro circuito de recompensa mucho más rápido que cualquier droga: nuestra comida procesada favorita. Según Michael Moss, autor del libro Hooked, «El humo de los cigarrillos tarda 10 segundos en agitar el cerebro, pero un toque de azúcar en la lengua lo hará en poco más de medio segundo, o seiscientos milisegundos, para ser precisos. Eso es casi 20 veces más rápido que los cigarrillos».\nEsto quiere decir que la comida basura puede llegar a ser mucho más adictiva que la droga. Y si lo pensamos fríamente, a mucha gente le costaría menos dejar el tabaco que el chocolate, las patatas fritas o las galletas industriales.\nDe hecho, esto viene de lejos. Una encuesta americana realizada en 1988 ya pidió a las personas que nombraran las cosas que pensaban que eran adictivas y luego las calificaran en una escala del 1 al 10, siendo 10 el más adictivo. Fumar recibió un 8.5, casi a la par que la heroína. Pero el consumo excesivo de este tipo de productos no se quedó atrás, con un 7.3, por encima de la cerveza, los tranquilizantes y las pastillas para dormir.\nLa trampa de las empresas alimentarias\nAnte esta realidad, algunas empresas alimentarias han sabido aprovechar muy bien el componente adictivo de determinados productos en nuestro cerebro. Por ello, la composición de muchos alimentos procesados ha sido minuciosamente diseñada para generar más adicción en los consumidores, con ello vender más unidades y, por ende, ganar más dinero.\nEstas empresas diseñan la comida basura para lograr ese «punto de felicidad» que las hace irresistibles y comercializan muchos productos utilizando tácticas tomadas de la industria del tabaco. Tanto es así, que hasta la famosa tabacalera Philip Morris adquirió empresas alimentarias como Kraft y General Foods, convirtiéndose en el mayor productor de alimentos procesados de Estados Unidos en los años 80.\nPor otro lado, muchas empresas alimentarias compraron otras compañías dedicadas a productos dietéticos. De esta manera, por un lado generan adicción y engordan a la población con sus productos, y por otro ofrecen el remedio para adelgazar.\nTodo esto es lo que sostiene el investigador y ganador de un Pulitzer, Michael Moss en su último libro, HookedHooked (disponible en Amazon), a través de numerosos documentos internos y varias entrevistas con expertos de la industria alimentaria.[disponible en Amazon](https://amzn.to/39hQx1x)\n«He estado arrastrándome a través de la parte más vulnerable de la industria de alimentos procesados durante 10 años y sigo asombrado por la profundidad de la astucia de su estrategia, no solo para aprovechar nuestros instintos básicos, sino también para explotar nuestros intentos de controlar nuestros hábitos», concluye el autor.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20https://www.epe.es/es/salud/20241220/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785531%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.epe.es/es/salud/20241220/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785531%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.epe.es/es/salud/20241220/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785531&text=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20%20https://www.epe.es/es/salud/20241220/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785531%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40elperiodico_Esp)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20&body=https://www.epe.es/es/salud/20241220/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785531%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\n[Los videntes coinciden: este será el número que ganará 'El Gordo' de la Lotería de Navidad](https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241216/videntes-coinciden-numero-gordo-loteria-nacional-dv-112661631)[El misterio del 'Osaka madrileño': cómo un pueblo de 99 habitantes se ha convertido en el epicentro del arte japonés](https://www.epe.es/es/cultura/20241214/misterio-osaka-madrileno-pueblo-99-112523014)[David Bisbal cantará desde el balcón de la Real Casa de Correos en Sol: fechas y horarios](https://www.epe.es/es/espana/madrid/20241216/david-bisbal-cantara-balcon-real-correos-sol-112673889)[El juez del caso hidrocarburos rastrea el dinero que oculta Aldama en el extranjero a través de sus testaferros](https://www.epe.es/es/investigacion/20241217/juez-caso-hidrocarburos-rastrea-dinero-aldama-extranjero-112705485)[Casarse en El Paticano, la iglesia de Madrid que cambia al Cristo por un pato de goma: 'Él se nos apareció y nos encargó fundar esta religión](https://www.epe.es/es/reportajes/20241218/casarse-paticano-iglesia-madrid-cambia-cristo-pato-goma-religion-patolica-112669057)[Las cuentas de Doña Manolita, la administración de Loterías más famosa: facturación millonaria y beneficios de 700.000 euros](https://www.epe.es/es/reportajes/20241219/cuentas-dona-manolita-administracion-loterias-112685732)[La panadería de Carabanchel que triunfa con sus magdalenas y sus roscones a cuatro euros: 'Vendemos todo en el día](https://www.epe.es/es/reportajes/20241214/magdalenas-artesanales-roscones-baratos-triunfan-carabanchel-112578501)[El Gobierno acuerda con los sindicatos que los funcionarios podrán jubilarse parcialmente a partir de 2026](https://www.epe.es/es/activos/20241218/gobierno-acuerda-sindicatos-funcionarios-podran-jubilarse-parcialmente-112715444)",
