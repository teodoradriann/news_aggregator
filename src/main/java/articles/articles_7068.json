    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Goshen County, Wyoming from 1901-2000 was 26.2. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Goshen County, Wyoming experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Goshen County, Wyoming history.",

    "text": "Facebook facial recognition | What the Tech?\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (WHAT THE TECH?) — Unlocking your Facebook account is a chore, and that is putting it nicely, but new facial recognition technology may make it easier.\nMeta says it’s testing facial ID to help users reclaim their accounts. To prove you are the account owner, you can take a video selfie which Facebook will compare to the profile photo. If it matches, Meta will allow you to recover the account.\nBut it puts Facebook back in the Facial Recognition business. The technology it terminated three years ago. It allowed users to be tagged in photos without permission.\nThe program gave Facebook users serious concerns about their privacy. This time, Meta says it will use the video selfie to identify the account owner, but will then delete the encrypted image from its servers.\nMeta says the facial recognition tool will work with both Facebook and Instagram users. Should you get locked out of an account, you should visit facebook.com/hacked or instagram.com/hacked.\nIf you’re not invited to use a video selfie, you can upload a government ID, like your driver’s license. If Facebook is convinced your account has been compromised, they’ll let you back in.\nKeep in mind, with over 300,000 people getting locked out of Facebook every day. It may take a while to hear back. And you may not hear back at all. So keep visiting those sites and report that you’re locked out.\nThen… cross your fingers.\nFor more “What the Tech?” stories, click here.",

    "title": "15 Things You’re Doing Every Day That Keep You Unhappy",
    "text": "How much of your time do you spend on these things?\nEver feel like no matter what you do, happiness seems just out of reach? You’re not alone. Sometimes, without even realizing it, we fall into habits that keep us stuck in a cycle of unhappiness. But don’t worry, we’ve got your back! Here are some everyday things you might be doing that are sabotaging your joy—and how to turn it all around. Let’s get you smiling again!\n1. Constantly comparing yourself to others.\nEver find yourself looking around and thinking everyone else has it all together? Whether it’s your coworker with the fancy job title, your friend with the perfect relationship, or that neighbor with the dream house, constant comparison can seriously mess with your head. When you’re always measuring your life against others, you end up feeling inadequate and down. It’s like running a race you can never win.\n2. Engaging in negative self-talk.\nThat little voice in your head that says you’re not good enough? Ugh, it’s the worst! Negative self-talk can totally wreck your self-esteem and make you believe you can’t achieve anything. It’s like having a personal bully living in your brain. This constant negativity keeps you stuck in a miserable cycle where you start acting in ways that confirm your worst fears. It’s exhausting and so not worth it.\n3. Overindulging in social media.\nSocial media can be a blast, but too much of it can make you anxious and feel like you’re missing out. Yeah, FOMO is real. The constant stream of perfect lives can make you feel ‘less than’ and jealous. Plus, it eats up time you could spend on more fulfilling stuff. The more you scroll, the more disconnected you feel from real-life interactions, which are super important for your happiness.\n4. Procrastinating important tasks.\nProcrastination—we’ve all been there. Putting off important tasks just adds to your stress and creates a looming sense of dread. You know that feeling when you have a million things to do but can’t bring yourself to start? It’s like a dark cloud hanging over your head. The longer you avoid tasks, the more they weigh on your mind, making it hard to relax and enjoy your free time. This ongoing stress can seriously dampen your mood and overall happiness.\n5. Overloading your schedule.\nAre you constantly running from one thing to the next without a moment to breathe? Saying yes to everything can leave you totally wiped out and stressed. When your schedule is jam-packed, there’s no time for self-care or just chilling out. The constant hustle can lead to burnout, making it hard to enjoy even the things you used to love. And let’s be honest, being super busy can strain your relationships too, leaving you feeling isolated and unsupported.\n6. Neglecting self-care.\nIt’s hard when you’re running on fumes and just can’t catch a break. Neglecting self-care can leave you physically and mentally drained. When you don’t take time to recharge, you’re more likely to feel irritable, stressed, and totally overwhelmed. Over time, this can lead to serious issues like anxiety and depression. Without self-care, you’re running on empty, making it hard to find joy in everyday life. Remember, you’ve got to fill your own cup first!\n7. Not setting boundaries.\nBeing a people-pleasing machine who is constantly pulled in all directions is exhausting! When you don’t set boundaries, you end up feeling overwhelmed and totally drained. You start to resent the people around you because you’re always putting their needs before your own. And let’s be real, it’s a fast track to burnout. You lose sight of who you are because you’re so busy catering to everyone else. Seriously, it’s okay to say no sometimes and put yourself first!\n8. Avoiding physical activity.\nEver have those days when the couch just seems way too comfy to leave? Yeah, me too. But avoiding physical activity can really mess with your mood and energy levels. When you skip out on exercise, you miss out on those awesome endorphins that make you feel great. Plus, you end up feeling sluggish and tired all the time. It’s like your body is begging you to get moving, but you’re stuck in a rut.\n9. Isolating yourself from others.\nWe all have moments when we want to hide away from the world, but isolating yourself can really take a toll on your happiness. Human connection is key to feeling good, and when you cut yourself off, you start to feel lonely and down. It’s like you’re missing out on all the good vibes that come from hanging out with friends and family. Plus, when you’re isolated, you don’t have that support system to help you through tough times.\n10. Living in the past.\nYou know those moments when you can’t stop replaying old mistakes or regrets? It’s like a never-ending loop in your head! Living in the past can steal your joy. When you’re constantly thinking about what went wrong or what you could’ve done differently, you’re not living in the now. It’s like you’re stuck in a time warp of negativity. This can lead to feelings of sadness and hopelessness, making it difficult to enjoy the present.\n11. Holding onto grudges.\nDo you often stew over something someone did ages ago? Let me tell you, it’s like carrying around a backpack full of rocks! Holding onto grudges can seriously weigh you down. When you’re constantly thinking about how someone wronged you, it keeps you stuck in a negative mindset. It’s like reliving the hurt over and over again. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and a whole lot of bitterness.\n12. Chasing perfection.\nYou know that feeling when nothing you do ever seems good enough? Perfectionism is a never-ending battle. Striving for perfection can leave you feeling constantly stressed and disappointed. It’s like setting yourself up for failure because, let’s be real, perfection doesn’t exist! This constant pressure can make you anxious and highly critical of yourself. You end up missing out on celebrating your achievements because you’re too focused on what could be better.\n13. Ignoring your passions and hobbies.\nOverlooking the things that bring you fun and joy can make everything feel so monotonous and dull. When you skip out on what you love, you miss those moments of creativity and relaxation that make life enjoyable. And you don’t give your mind a break from the rigmaroles of everyday life. If you’re not careful, you’ll find you lose interest in the things you enjoy most through sheer neglect.\n14. Failing to practice gratitude.\nIt’s easy to find yourself focusing on everything that’s wrong instead of what’s right, but it’s a total mood killer! Failing to practice gratitude can make you feel constantly dissatisfied. When you’re always zeroing in on the negatives, it’s easy to overlook all the good stuff happening around you. And trust me, the good stuff is there if you open your eyes to it.\n15. Focusing on material possessions.\nEver get that itch for the latest gadget or designer clothes, thinking it’ll make you happy? Spoiler alert: it won’t. Focusing on material possessions can send you down a never-ending rabbit hole of wanting more. It’s like chasing a mirage—temporary satisfaction that quickly fades. You end up feeling like you’re never enough, always needing the next best thing. True happiness comes from meaningful experiences and relationships, not stuff.",
