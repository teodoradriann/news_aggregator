    "text": "Dodgers Team News\nDodgers Operating With The Confidence That They’ll Sign Roki Sasaki\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers put all of their international signings on hold for the 2025 class. They’re currently exploring trades in order to get more international bonus pool money.\nThe actions of the organization essentially say it all: The Dodgers are operating with the confidence that they will sign Roki Sasaki.\nDodgers Nation’s Doug McKain provided more insight on the Sasaki sweepstakes in a recent episode of Dodgers Dougout Live.\n“What I’ve heard on Roki Sasaki so far is Yoshinobu Yamamoto is playing an important role in whether the Dodgers land him,” McKain said. “Los Angeles has been operating with the confidence that they will sign Sasaki.”\nMore news: Tyler Glasnow Spoke to Roki Sasaki On the Phone in Attempt to Recruit him to Dodgers\nWhile everyone looks to Shohei Ohtani as the biggest reason for Sasaki to join the reigning World Series champions, McKain pointed toward the importance of Yamamoto, who is a starting pitcher “solely by trade.”\n“Yoshinobu Yamamoto embracing Roki Sasaki is going to have a major impact,” McKain said. “Shohei transitioned to The Show seven years ago, Yamamoto did it last year.”\nWith Yamamoto making the jump to stateside baseball just a year ago, McKain believes Sasaki will have someone to relate to since the process is still relatively fresh for the Dodgers star. Additionally, the two pitchers have the same agent which also adds to the familiarity aspect.\nSasaki has until Jan .23 to sign, when his posting window closes. The Dodgers, San Diego Padres, and Toronto Blue Jays are the three finalists in the Sasaki sweepstakes. But the Dodgers don’t usually take such big risks without being confident about an impending reward.\nThe Dodgers’ recent actions only highlight just how optimistic the organization is about signing Sasaki.\nThe Dodgers can also bulk up the amount they offer Sasaki by making trades in the coming days. The Dodgers have the least amount of money in their international bonus pool out of the three final teams; however, the team can get over $8 million in their bonus pool by orchestrating multiple trades.\nAlthough making trades could increase the amount of money in their bonus pool, it’s uncertain the Dodgers absolutely have to in order to sign Sasaki. It’s evident the 23-year-old isn’t joining MLB for the money, or else he would’ve waited until he was eligible to receive a lucrative contract at 25 years old.\nMore Roki Sasaki News:\nWhen Will Roki Sasaki Sign With Dodgers, Padres, or Blue Jays?

    "title": "Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary",
    "text": "Following the Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel came to Mary and pronounced she would become the mother of our Lord, Mary traveled from Galilee to Judea to visit her cousin Elizabeth, an elderly woman, who after a lifetime with a barren womb had conceived a child. Elizabeth, whose pregnancy also followed a message from the angel Gabriel, would give birth to John the Baptist.\nAnd while Gabriel greeted Mary with the words, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women,” Elizabeth proclaimed, “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.” These two moments recorded in Scripture form the first part of the Hail Mary prayer we say today. The entire Visitation account is recorded in Luke 1:39-56.\nHere, scripture goes on to tell us that John the Baptist, still unborn, leapt for joy in Elizabeth’s womb and she was filled with the Holy Spirit. We are shown in this passage the transition between the Old and the New Covenant. On the one hand, we have a woman too old to conceive a child through ordinary means, yet through the extraordinary power of the Holy Spirit, her womb is prepared and granted the grace to bear the last prophet of the Old Covenant. On the other hand, we have a woman quite young and not ready to conceive a child through ordinary means, but again through the extraordinary power of the Holy Spirit her womb is chosen and prepared to bear the New Covenant Himself.\nIt is through this powerful encounter between these two holy women that the Old and New Covenant intersect and the totality of salvation history is made clear.\nThis feast was formerly celebrated on July 2, but was changed to fall between the solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord and the birth of John the Baptist to more closely mirror the gospel accounts.\nLessons\n1. How did Elizabeth know that Mary was carrying our Lord? What made her understand that her young cousin would be the most blessed woman of all time? She knew it because she recognized the Holy Spirit’s presence within her signified through the extraordinary life “leaping for joy” in her womb.\n2. We must learn to recognize the Holy Spirit’s presence in our own lives and mirror the experience of Elizabeth and Mary. Through the submission of will and the acceptance of extraordinary grace, Christ can grow within each of us and we will be driven more and more to act and react with peace, thanksgiving, and joy.\nPrayer\nO God who didst lead the Blessed Virgin Mary to visit Elizabeth, to their exceeding joy and comfort: Grant unto thy people, that as Mary rejoiced to be called the Mother of the Lord, so they may ever rejoice to believe the incarnation of thine only begotten Son; to whom with the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.\nOther Saints We Remember Today\n- Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n- St. Petronilla (1st Century), Virgin\nImage by\nDorothée QUENNESSON from Pixabay",

    "title": "I was unhappy with our fielding: Harmanpreet after big defeat to Australia - DailyExcelsior",
    "text": "MUMBAI, Dec 28: India women’s team captain Harmanpreet Kaur expressed her unhappiness with the fielding effort and asked her players to play aggressive cricket following the home team’s crushing six-wicket loss to Australia in the first one-dayer here on Thursday. Despite India putting up their best-ever ODI score of 282/8 against Australia, the visitors chased down the target in the 47th over with opener Phoebe Litchfield (78) and Ellyse Perry (75) involved in a 148-run partnership. A sloppy Indian fielding allowed Phoebe, Ellyse, Tahlia McGrath (68 off 55 balls) and Beth Mooney (42) to score runs at will to overhaul the target with ease. “We managed to get a defendable total. Bowlers did their job but fielding didn’t work well. After a while dew was there, but bowlers did well to keep stumps in play,” said Harmanpreet after the match. “But I was unhappy with our fielding, Australia were amazing saving runs. Pooja was great. We need to back ourselves and play aggressive cricket,” she added. Australia skipper Alyssa Healy, who could not contribute with the bat at the top of the order after going for a duck, said the batters quickly overcame the early loss and this was the “blueprint” the team was aiming for. “Batting approach was sensational, that was the blueprint we want to put out there. Our batters play down the ground really well, helps when the ball is skidding on a little bit. Girls bounced back and showed how we wanted to play,” said Alyssa. Ellyse said her team-mates knew a tough contest was expected from India and the need of the hour was to “raise the bar”. India had defeated Australia by eight wickets in the one-off Test at this venue a few days back. “We’ve been pushed by India, so we got to raise the bar. I thought 280 was around, had a good effort in the field and bowled well for a large part. With the lights coming on and ball coming on, the bowlers had a low margin for error with the field restrictions. We started positively and capitalised. “We never let the grip loose which was pleasing. Our energy in the field matched with the bowling.” (PTI)",

The family posted bail on Wednesday evening, according to the Storey County Sheriff's Department. In a video that went viral on TikTok, Ricky Johnson can be seen confronting the Millers over comments Gary Miller made while Johnson was seeking signatures for a voter petition to cap attorney’s fees in Nevada. “He just said there’s a hanging tree down there to hang people like me,” Johnson said in the video, which received more than a million views before Johnson took it down over community guidelines. The incident has since been condemned by multiple parties who spoke out against racism, including Virginia City, Hot August Nights, Gov. Joe Lombardo and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford. Several event attendees in the video have also been permanently banned by Hot August Nights . Here is what we know about the Miller family based on public records. The Millers own property in Virginia City Husband and wife Gary and Janis Miller are listed as the owners of 171 S. C Street and 161 S. C Street in Virginia City, according to Storey County Assessor records. The adjoined properties comprise one whole parcel and are currently occupied by the Firehouse Grill Saloon & Grill, which is renting the space from the Millers. The couple bought the property for $2.3 million on March 1 of this year. The Firehouse Grill Saloon & Grill initially welcomed the Millers as landlords, posting on Facebook in April about a party it held for the couple. Following the incident, however, the business disavowed any connection with them, referring to Janis Miller as “the lady in the video wearing a Tshirt that we sell in our bar.” “We absolutely support Everyone, we do not discriminate in any way,” the Firehouse Saloon posted on Facebook in response to the incident before taking the page down. The Millers reside in Minden and moved to the area from California While the Millers have been associated with Virginia City after the viral incident, the couple’s official residence is in a town 30 miles away. Tax records for their Virginia City property list a Minden address as the couple’s official residence, which is in Douglas County. Records from the Nevada Secretary of State’s office also list Gary Miller as the managing member of a limited liability company or LLC based in Minden. Prior to moving to Minden, the Millers also lived in the Bay Area. While living in California, Janis Miller worked as a Catholic school teacher at Grace School and Our Lady of Grace Church in Castro Valley and the Catholic Diocese of Oakland, according to public records. What were the Millers charged and arrested for? The Millers were charged and arrested following an investigation by the Storey County Sheriff’s Office. Gary Miller, who turns 75 this month, was charged with breach of peace, a gross misdemeanor. Janis Miller, 67, who could be seen touching Johnson multiple times in the video, was charged with battery, which is a misdemeanor. Daughter Tiffany Miller, 45, was also charged with a misdemeanor for obstructing and delaying a peace officer.",
