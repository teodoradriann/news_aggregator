    "text": "The city council of Palma takes preventive measures during the long weekend beginning November 1 after the orange alert forecast for the storm DANA, while the Spain’s State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and the 112 Emergency Service are urging Balearic residents to exercise extreme caution. DANA: Palma de Mallorca emergency prevention plan Reflecting on the damage caused by recent storms and with rainfall expected to reach 50 litres per square metre within an hour, Palma’s deputy mayor, Javier Bonet, has announced a series of safety measures. Alongside deploying additional firefighters, local police, Civil Protection units, and 20 Emaya (Municipal Water And Sewage Company) municipal brigades, the city council will also temporarily close several parks and cemeteries from Friday November 1 at 2:00 pm until Monday November 4.\nAffected parks include Passeig Sagrera, Bellver Forest, Son Tarres Park, and Ses Vies Park. However, in recognition of All Saints’ Day, cemeteries will remain accessible to visitors from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm.\nMost Read on Euro Weekly News Squatter crackdown: Spain’s swift new law puts homeowners first Network provider Ericsson might relocate its HQ from Sweden to the US Liam Payne's funeral: a heartfelt farewell to a beloved star taken too soon Additionally, as a proactive measure following recent flooding incidents in Valencia , the city council will assist homeless individuals in flood-risk areas by providing temporary accommodation for the duration of the alert.\nOrange alert for potential flash flooding in Mallorca AEMET warns of intense storm activity due to large-scale convective systems that will likely affect the Balearic Sea and surrounding islands, with rainfall of up to 50 mm expected in an hour and totals reaching 120 mm in 12 hours.\nThe agency offers real-time weather forecasts online for those wishing to monitor conditions as they develop. 112 Emergency Service, which has activated the Severity Index 1 (IG1) of the Meteobal Plan for rain and storms, reminds residents to follow safety recommendations, such as staying clear of flood-prone areas, avoiding basement and low areas, checking household drainage systems, keeping mobile phones charged, and calling 112 for emergencies.With these measures in place, Palma’s city council alongside the Balearic Goverment and the 112 Emergency Service hope to mitigate the impact of this storm, keeping residents informed and as safe as possible throughout the coming days.\nView all weather news .\nTags: DANA , Palma de Mallorca Share this story\nshare on Facebook share on Twitter share on WhatsApp share on LinkedIn share on Flipboard share on Email Sign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

India Judiciary Delhi HC refuses to permit Shab-e-Barat prayers at Mehrauli’s Akhoondji mosque demolished by DDA The mosque in Mehrauli was recently demolished after being declared illegal by the Delhi Development Authority. PTI 23 February, 2024 03:16 pm IST Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin File photo of Delhi High Court | PTI Text Size: A- A+\nNew Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished ‘Akhoondji mosque’ and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.\nMuslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors on Shab-e-Barat (the night of atonement).\nJustice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, while dealing with an application by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board, noted that the court has directed status quo on the site which is now in the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).\nShow Full Article\nThe application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition.\nJustice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, is already listed for final disposal on March 7.\n“At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,” ordered the court.\nThe ‘Akhoondji mosque’, believed to be over 600 years old, as well as the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by the DDA on January 30.\nThe counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families are buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed offer prayers there on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat later this month.\nHe said the mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered there for the last many years. There was also an “active graveyard” which was used by the locals, the advocate told the court.\nOn February 5, the high court had asked the DDA to maintain status quo on the site where the mosque once stood.\nThe petitioner committee has argued that the demolition of the mosque was illegal.\nThe DDA has defended its action before the high court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of its Religious Committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the Religious Committee afforded an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner has, however, contended that the Religious Committee has no jurisdiction to order any demolition action.\nOn January 31, the court asked the DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis.\nIt also asked the development authority to state whether any prior notice was given before the demolition.\nThis report is auto-generated from PTI news service.

    "text": "ViolencesTroisième soirée de tensions en Irlande du Nord\nUne agression sexuelle impliquant deux adolescents a déclenché une vague d’émeutes contre la communauté roumaine.\nLa ville nord-irlandaise de Ballymena a connu une nouvelle soirée de tensions mercredi, avec plusieurs centaines de personnes descendues dans la rue face à une police déployée en nombre, après deux jours de violences visant des immigrés et d’affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre.\nMalgré les appels au calme des dirigeants de la province, la police antiémeute a fait face dans la soirée à des jets de cocktails Molotov et autres projectiles dans à Ballymena, auxquels elle a répondu avec des canons à eaux, a constaté un journaliste de l’AFP.\nCela fait trois jours que la ville, située à une cinquantaine de kilomètres au nord de Belfast, est confrontée à des heurts, qualifiés de violences «racistes» par la police et «d’attaques insensées» par le Premier ministre Keir Starmer.\nUn centre de loisirs incendié\nCes violences se sont également propagées à d’autres localités mercredi. Un centre de loisirs a notamment été incendié à Larne, localité située à une trentaine de kilomètres à l’est de Ballymena. Selon les médias locaux, ce centre avait temporairement accueilli la veille des personnes qui avaient besoin d’un hébergement d’urgence du fait des violences. «Le centre de loisirs de Larne a été attaqué par des voyous masqués (…) Larne n’a pas besoin de cela», a réagi sur X un député local, Danny Donnelly.\nCes heurts ont éclaté lundi après l’inculpation de deux adolescents de 14 ans pour la tentative de viol d’une jeune fille. La police, qui évoque des violences «motivées par des considérations raciales», n’a pas communiqué sur l’origine des deux jeunes. Selon les médias britanniques, ils se sont exprimés par l’intermédiaire d’un interprète roumain lors de leur comparution lundi au tribunal.\n32 policiers blessés\nEn deux jours, 32 policiers ont été blessés tandis que six personnes ont été arrêtées. L’une d’elles a été inculpée pour troubles à l’ordre public, a déclaré mercredi un responsable de la police, Ryan Henderson, lors d’une conférence de presse.\nLes forces de l’ordre ont fait appel à des renforts du reste du pays en prévision de nouveaux heurts.\nKeir Starmer condamne\nDevant le Parlement mercredi, Keir Starmer a dit condamner «fermement» les violences des jours précédents.\nMardi soir, des centaines d’individus avaient pris pour cible des habitations et commerces et jeté des briques, fusées et cocktails Molotov sur la police. Des incidents plus sporadiques ont aussi eu lieu dans d’autres villes notamment à Belfast, Carrickfergus et Newtownabbey, mardi, et Coleraine, mercredi.\nLes représentants du gouvernement nord-irlandais, composé de quatre partis politiques et dirigé par l’élue républicaine du Sinn Fein Michelle O’Neill, ont condamné mercredi ces «violences à caractère raciste» et lancé «un appel urgent au calme». Ces émeutes ont notamment visé des zones où vivent des immigrés roumains à Ballymena. «Ce sont les Roumains qui sont plus spécifiquement ciblés», estime ainsi Nicola Guy, une habitante de Ballymena âgée de 42 ans, résidant non loin d’une maison incendiée qui était habitée par une famille de Roms.\n«Assez des étrangers»\n«Nous envoyons le message que Ballymena en a assez des étrangers», a déclaré mercredi soir à l’AFP Allison McCurdy, 52 ans, une habitante.\nLes premières violences ont éclaté lundi soir à l’issue d’un rassemblement en soutien à la jeune victime de la tentative de viol présumée et à sa famille. «Les actes motivés par la haine et la loi de la foule ne font que déchirer le tissu de notre société: ils ne résolvent rien et ne servent à personne», a souligné mercredi le commissaire Jon Boutcher.\n«Ceux qui instrumentalisent la situation pour attiser les tensions raciales se moquent de la justice et n’ont rien à offrir à leurs communautés, si ce n’est de la division et du désordre», ont renchéri les membres de l’exécutif dans leur communiqué commun.\nMais le député du parti Traditional Unionist Voice Jim Allister a toutefois souligné à la chambre des Communes à Londres que s’il n’y a «aucune excuse» pour de tels actes, «le gouvernement doit prendre conscience des tensions sous-jacentes engendrées par une immigration incontrôlée et souvent clandestine».",
