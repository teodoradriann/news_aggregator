    "text": "Cancer death rates ‘almost 60% higher in deprived areas’\nResearch by Cancer Research UK found that about 28,400 cancer deaths each year are associated with deprivation.\nStorm Newton\nCancer death rates are almost 60% higher for people living in the most deprived areas of the UK, according to new analysis.\nExperts from Cancer Research UK suggest this is down to people from poorer areas being diagnosed too late, and said improved access to the NHS is “vital”.\nPeople in deprived areas are also more likely to smoke, be obese, and are less likely to take part in cancer screening programmes, the report suggests.\nResearch by the charity found that about 28,400 cancer deaths each year are associated with deprivation.\nThis is the equivalent to 78 additional deaths a day, and more than three in 30 of all deaths from cancer.\n“These are excess cancer deaths which may have been avoided if the whole country had the same age- and sex-specific mortality rates as seen in the least deprived areas, within each UK nation,” the report added.\nAlmost half (47%) of these deaths are due to lung cancer, according to the analysis.\nIt found the proportion of people who smoke cigarettes – the single biggest risk factor of lung cancer – in deprived areas was 22%, compared with just 6% in wealthier areas.\nThe proportion of adults who were obese in deprived areas was 36%, compared with 19% in better-off areas.\nPeople in poorer areas are also more likely to be diagnosed late and wait longer for treatment, according to the report.\nThey are also less likely to take part in screening, Cancer Research UK said.\nOne example used in the report is the bowel screening programme, which allows patients to collect a stool sample at home before posting it back for testing.\nIt found there is a 57% uptake of the test in deprived areas, compared with 76% in wealthier areas.\nDr Ian Walker, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said: “Beating cancer must mean beating it for everybody.\n“No-one should be at a greater risk of dying from this devastating disease simply because of where they live.\n“These figures are shocking and unacceptable – but crucially, they’re avoidable.\n“People from more deprived areas are being diagnosed too late.\n“Improving access to NHS services through funding and innovation will be vital, so that those who seek help get the care they deserve.”\nKaris Betts, inequalities lead at Cancer Research UK, said: “To tackle cancer inequalities, our health services need to work together with communities themselves – to prevent the causes of cancer and spot the disease earlier.\n“Sustainably funding support to help people stop smoking will avoid so many cancer cases in deprived areas.\n“But we also need new and better ways to diagnose cancer at an early stage, like targeted lung screening, which is proven to help save lives in at-risk communities.\n“It’s vital that this is fully rolled out across England, followed by all four UK nations.”\nThe analysis comes after the Government launched a call for evidence to help shape a national cancer plan earlier this month.\nThe blueprint is expected to outline actions to transform how the disease is treated in a bid to reduce deaths.\nReacting to the report, Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England’s national clinical director for cancer, said: “NHS staff are working hard to ensure that everyone affected by cancer receives a prompt diagnosis and treatment, and initiatives such as our targeted lung check have been especially helpful for people in deprived areas who are at greater risk of cancer, so that if they have lung cancer it is now being diagnosed at a much earlier stage.\n“We recognise there is still much more to do to ensure that everyone receives a timely diagnosis and treatment, and are seeing record numbers come forward for urgent checks, with suspected cancer referrals more than doubling in the last decade, a narrowing of the gap between the most and least well-off, and cancer survival rates have never been higher.\n“The NHS is fully committed to improving access to cancer care and recently confirmed the Faster Diagnosis Standard target is to be increased, to see around 100,000 more patients receive a diagnosis or the all-clear within four weeks next year.”",

    "text": "By Raphael Satter\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Internet firm Cloudflare said in a statement on Thursday that an advanced group of hackers tried to burrow deep into its global network late last year but were thwarted.\nThe company, which did not identify the hackers, said in a blog post that it had discovered the intruders on Thanksgiving in late November and ejected them the following day. The spies were able to access “some documentation and a limited amount of source code” but Cloudflare said the operational impact of the intrusion was “extremely limited.”\n“Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global network.”\nCloudflare said it had called in cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to help remediate the breach and that the company confirmed that the last evidence of “threat activity” was left on Nov. 24.\nCrowdStrike did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI and the American cyber watchdog agency CISA also did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\nCloudflare offers a suite of web and application services, including content delivery and network protection. A large chunk of the internet relies on the San Francisco-based company to deliver its web content to users, so any disruption to its network can have serious knock-on effects.\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

    "text": "“Real, Relaxed and Doesn’t Act High and Mighty”: Max Verstappen May Be a God on the Track But Acts Nothing Like It\n[Aishwary Gaonkar](/author/aishwarygaonkar/)\n|Published January 07, 2024\nMax Verstappen is perhaps a misunderstood personality. Although he is known for being intense and ruthless on track, people who know him personally often testify differently. They often describe the Dutchman’s persona to be very genuine, cheerful, and approachable. His father, Jos Verstappen, and Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko have often also had similar things to say about the 26-year-old. Now, even Dutch presenter Jay Jay Boske has joined this bandwagon.\nAdvertisement\nIn a Dutch podcast on Kijk.nl, Boske showered praises on Max Verstappen’s off-track personality alongside songwriter Flemming Freddy Viguurs. As seen in a\nclip on Twitter (now X), he elaborated on how “friendly” the three-time champion was to him when he once worked with him. The 26-year-old interacted very nicely with Boske and shared insights about sim racing with him.\nEven his guest, Flemming Freddy Viguurs, cited a similar experience with\nVerstappen. Flemming once spent an hour with the Dutch racer. He provided some details about the Red Bull driver’s persona by stating, “He’s real, relaxed, and doesn’t act high and mighty. And that’s maybe the most important.”\nAdvertisement\nBoske had a similar point previously on how Max never acted like the racing god he is on track. He said, “He made jokes, he was sympathetic, he even knew things about me. And it was very chill.”\nLoading embed tweet https://twitter.com/SCUDERIAFEMBOY/status/1743665658695422041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\nOften, many have negative stereotypes about F1 drivers that are short-tempered. While Verstappen has such a public perception, Boske cited that his experience was very contrasting to this perception and what was told to him.\nBoth Flemming and Boske felt that while Verstappen is a big star in the F1 world, he is quite humble and down-to-earth off-track. The former even highlighted how the Dutchman likes simple things like other people such as playing FIFA on PlayStation.\nMax Verstappen once stated the human side of sporting GOATs\nMax Verstappen is steadily climbing the ladder of becoming one of the greatest F1 drivers in history. While many claim that he has achieved the GOAT status with his three world titles and 54 wins, some still debate it. Regardless, Verstappen is nonchalant about this perception. He highlighted how all sporting GOATs are eventually humans.\nAdvertisement\nWhen asked in an interview about how he feels about\ngetting compared with Lionel Messi, Tiger Woods, and Roger Federer, the 26-year-old was quirky in his response. He cited how “everyone goes to the same bathroom”.\nDespite the quirky analogy, the\nRed Bull driver’s point was very real. He elaborated, “One can [play] football [soccer] better, one can race a bit better, and the other can run better. But in the end, everyone’s good in their sport, but in the end, we’re all humans”.\nLoading embed tweet https://twitter.com/GlobalSportsSA2/status/1728963520237346972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\nVerstappen usually shows this casual approach to not being too bothered with his achievements. After clinching his first world title in 2021, the Dutchman has relatively calmed down and behaves a lot more calculative on track.\nThe former Toro Rosso driver is keeping a grounded perspective after having to grind his way to the top of F1. All those midfield struggles and collisions have shaped and molded his race craft and understanding.\nThe trajectory of success Verstappen is on currently, he can easily scale the statistical benchmarks of being an F1 GOAT. Nonetheless, one would hope the negative image of his persona as Red Bull’s bad boy evolves as it did for Sebastian Vettel.\nAdvertisement\nShare this article",

    "text": "If youʼre like most people in todayʼs fast-paced, information-overloaded world, you might be looking for ways to boost your brainpower, sharpen your focus, and protect your cognitive health as you age. As a functional medicine practitioner, I’ve seen the profound impact of targeted nutrition and lifestyle strategies on mental performance and mood. And one of the most exciting areas of innovation in this field is the use of nootropics—compounds that enhance memory, creativity, motivation, and overall cognitive function.\nWhen you hear the word “nootropic,ˮ you might think of prescription smart drugs or questionable supplements promising unrealistic results. But the truth is many safe, natural nootropics have been used in traditional healing systems for centuries and are now being validated by cutting-edge scientific research.\nIn fact, you’re probably already using the worldʼs most popular nootropic: caffeine! But while caffeine can provide a temporary energy and focus boost, it can also lead to jitters, crashes, and dependence over time. The good news is that several other nootropics can deliver sustained cognitive benefits without the drawbacks.\nIn my\nrecent podcast episode, I took a deep dive into seven of the most effective, research-backed nootropics for optimizing brain function and mood. Today, Iʼll give you a quick overview of each one, along with practical tips for incorporating them into your own wellness routine.\nWhat Are “Nootropics”?\nBut first, let’s define what we mean by “nootropics.ˮ The term was coined in 1972 by Romanian psychologist and chemist Corneliu Giurgea, who described nootropics as substances that enhance learning and memory, protect the brain from injury or disease, and have very low toxicity and minimal side effects. (\n1)\nWhile the original definition was quite narrow, today’s Functional Medicine take on nootropics is more expansive. We now understand that there are many compounds—including nutrients, botanicals, and yes, even some pharmaceuticals—that can optimize brain function through a variety of physiological pathways, such as:\n- Increasing circulation, oxygenation, and energy production in the brain\n- Providing building blocks for key neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine\n- Enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells)\n- Protecting neurons from oxidative stress, inflammation, and toxins\n- Modulating the stress response and supporting a balanced mood\nWith that context in mind, let’s dive into my top seven nootropics for peak brain performance and emotional resilience.\nMy Top 7 (Caffeine-Free) Nootropics\nCiticoline: The Brain Cell Rebuilder\nCiticoline (CDP-choline) is a naturally occurring compound essential for synthesizing phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of the brain cell membranes that support neural communication. Citicoline readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, where it helps increase levels of energizing neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. (\n2)\nCiticoline improves attention, memory, information processing, and mood, especially in middle-aged and older adults. For example, one randomized controlled trial found that 12 weeks of citicoline supplementation significantly enhanced overall memory performance, including recall of names and faces, in healthy volunteers with mild memory complaints. (\n3)\nThere are several different forms of citicoline available on the market. My favorite is Cognizin. It’s a patented, allergen-free, water-soluble form supported by several peer-reviewed clinical trials.\nCiticoline is often stacked with DHA (long-chain omega-3), B vitamins (B6, folate, B12), and uridine monophosphate (UMP, which we’ll discuss later in this article). Studies have shown that combining these nutrients together produces greater benefits than taking either alone.\nThe dose of Cognizin ranges from 125-500 mg/d. The lower dose is typically used in formulas with other nootropic nutrients, whereas the higher dose is used when Cognizin is taken by itself and/or when more support is needed, i.e. in cases of dementia or more serious cognitive or neurological impairment.\nLion’s Mane Mushroom: The Nerve Growth Enhancer\nLion’s mane (Hericium erinaceus) is an edible fungus with a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. Thanks to its unique appearance—a shaggy, cascading “maneˮ of white tendrils—and potent nootropic properties, it has earned the nickname “smart mushroom.ˮ\nThe secret to lion’s mane’s brain-boosting power lies in its ability to stimulate the production of nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. Lion’s mane contains two novel compounds—hericenones and erinacines—that can cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate NGF synthesis. (\n4)\nThis NGF-enhancing effect is believed to underlie the improvements in memory, mental clarity, and mood seen in animal and human studies of lion’s mane. In one small Japanese study, older adults with mild cognitive impairment who supplemented with lion’s mane for 16 weeks had significantly better scores on a cognitive function scale compared to the placebo group. (\n5)\nYou have to be very careful when sourcing mushrooms like lion’s mane. As mushroom supplements have become more popular, so has the proliferation of cheap, poor-quality products.\nWhat’s more, most mushroom products on the market don’t actually contain mushrooms—the fruiting body stage of the fungal life cycle you think of when you picture a mushroom. Instead, they contain mycelium, the thread-like, vegetative part of the fungus that gives rise to the fruiting body.\nWhile mycelium has some health benefits, most modern clinical studies demonstrating the benefits of mushrooms have used fruiting bodies, not mycelium. Fruiting bodies are also what has been used for over 5,000 years in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nMost Lion’s Mane is mycelium grown on grain. The mycelium on grain has low levels of beta-glucan and hericenones and very high levels of starch. The mycelium does not fully consume the grain, and the product is more akin to Tempeh than anything else. The final product sold as a mushroom supplement contains two ingredients—mycelium and grain—instead of just one (mycelium).\nIt’s also important to choose organic mushrooms, given the potential for adulteration with pesticides and other chemicals.\nPhosphatidylserine: The Memory Molecule\nPhosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid that’s highly concentrated in the brain, where it plays important roles in neuronal signaling, plasticity, and survival. While our bodies can synthesize some PS, we also get it from foods like organ meats and fish. However, many people benefit from supplementation, especially as PS levels tend to decline with age.\nDozens of clinical trials have shown that PS supplementation can improve memory, attention, learning, and overall cognitive function, particularly in middle-aged and older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia. In one study of 149 people with age-related memory decline, taking 100 mg of PS three times daily for 12 weeks led to significant improvements in memory, language, and concentration compared to placebo. (\n6)\nPS has also been found to have stress-buffering and mood-supportive effects. For instance, in one trial of 80 golfers, taking 200 mg of PS for six weeks significantly reduced stress levels and improved overall well-being compared to placebo. (\n7)\nPS supplements have historically been derived from cow brains, soy, and sunflower. Bovine cortex PS was one of the first commercially available forms, but there are concerns about the potential transfer of prion diseases. For this reason, soy and sunflower-derived PS supplements are more commonly used now.\nThere is some evidence that soy PS may have greater bioavailability and the ability to support cognitive function compared to sunflower PS. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in elderly patients with memory complaints found that 300 mg daily of soy-derived PS improved memory and cognition, while sunflower PS showed no significant benefit over placebo. (\n8)\nResearchers believe soy PS may be incorporated more efficiently into neural cell membranes than sunflower PS due to differences in phospholipid structure. The fatty acid chains in soy PS may make them more compatible with and recognizable to human cell membranes.\nThere are two concerns with soy-derived PS supplements: most soybeans are GMO, and some people are sensitive to soy proteins.\nThe good news is that high-quality PS ingredients derived from soy contain no traces of soy protein. PS is typically made from soy lecithin, which contains different phospholipids, including PS. It is then highly purified to enrich the PS component through phospholipid exchange. Some of these higher-quality PS ingredients are also non-GMO.\nPS has shown the best results when combined with DHA, compounds that increase phosphatides (like UMP or citicoline), and Ginkgo biloba.\nThe recommended dosage of PS is 100–300 mg. As with the other nootropics we’ve discussed, lower doses are more common when PS is combined with synergistic nutrients. The higher end is for standalone use and more intensive therapy.\nBacopa Monnieri: The Ayurvedic Brain Tonic\nBacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is a staple herb in the ancient Indian healing system of Ayurveda, where it has been used for centuries to sharpen the intellect, enhance learning, and calm the mind. Modern research has revealed several mechanisms behind bacopa’s nootropic effects, including antioxidant neuroprotection, neurotransmitter modulation (especially acetylcholine and serotonin), and improved cerebral blood flow. (\n9)\nA meta-analysis of nine randomized, controlled trials found that bacopa supplementation significantly improved attention, processing speed, and memory in healthy adults, with effects building over time. (\nx) Bacopa has also been shown to have adaptogenic properties, helping to reduce stress and anxiety while supporting a balanced mood. In one study of 54 older adults, taking 300 mg of bacopa daily for 12 weeks led to significant improvements in both memory and depression scores compared to placebo. ( 10)\nMy preferred brand of Bacopa is called Bacognize from Verdure Sciences. They’ve forged lasting relationships with tribal families and family farms. The final Bacopa product is clean with controlled drying and collection techniques, which protects botanical integrity while providing a reliable livelihood and income to the families they work closely with.\nThey use proper identification tools (microscopy, macroscopy, and chemical), source traceability, and testing for chemicals and toxins to ensure the authenticity and purity of their Bacopa.\nBacognize has several other distinct features that set it apart:\n- It’s standardized to bacopa glycosides\n- It’s supported by published clinical research in peer-reviewed journals\n- It has demonstrated activity at the serotonin (5HT-1a) receptor\n- It meets or exceeds USP/ICH/Prop-65 standards for purity\n- It’s certified Glyphosate Residue Free\n- It’s Non-GMO Project Verified\nMany neurohackers combine Bacopa with PS, which assists neuronal communication. Combined PS and Bacopa may improve cognition better together through separate mechanisms.\nOne 2014 study examined a combination of Bacopa, PS, vitamin E, and astaxanthin and found it improved memory and other aspects of mental clarity in participants with cognitive impairment. (\n11)\nThe optimal dose of Bacopa can vary significantly based on the extract type used and other factors. For standardized bacopa extracts containing 55% bacosides (considered the most active compounds), a dosage of 300mg per day is commonly recommended for cognitive benefits. This can be split into multiple doses throughout the day.\nBacopa is fat-soluble, so it’s best taken with a meal that contains fat or with a small amount of MCT or coconut oil if taken in a fasted state.\nGinkgo Biloba: The Memory Booster\nGinkgo biloba is one of the most widely studied botanicals for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. Derived from the leaves of the ancient ginkgo tree, this botanical has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to support memory, circulation, and overall brain health.\nToday, Ginkgo is best known for its ability to enhance cerebrovascular function and protect neurons from oxidative stress. (\n12) Numerous clinical trials have shown that Ginkgo supplementation can improve several parameters of cognitive function in healthy adults and those with age-related cognitive decline or dementia. A meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials found that Ginkgo consistently improved attention, memory, and mental processing speed, with effects most pronounced in older adults with dementia. ( 13)\nOne of the most impressive studies on Ginkgo followed more than 3,000 older adults for several years and found that taking 240 mg of a standardized Ginkgo extract daily significantly slowed cognitive decline and reduced the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease compared to placebo. The ginkgo group also had better scores on tests of memory, attention, language, and other cognitive abilities. (\n14)\nChoose a Ginkgo leaf extract rather than Ginkgo nut extract or a whole herb powder. Leaf extracts have been used traditionally and studied most in the scientific literature, and they’re more potent and beneficial.\nNote that not all extracts are equal. The ratio of the extract (e.g., 1:1, 4:1, 8:1) refers to how concentrated it is. For example, with a 4:1 extract, for every 4 parts of the original material, only 1 part remains in the extract. This higher concentration is achieved through various extraction methods, such as solvents like water and ethanol. So, a 4:1 extract will be roughly 4x as concentrated as a 1:1 extract. While the concentration of an extract isn’t the only factor determining its efficacy, it’s important. All other things being equal, we’d expect a 4:1 extract of Gingko to be more effective than a 1:1 extract.\nGinkgo potentiates the action of other nootropics by increasing blood flow to/in the brain. The blood carries everything the brain needs to function optimally, including oxygen, glucose, lipids, micronutrients, amino acids, etc. Studies have shown that stacking it with DHA, PS, folate, and B12 can have a synergistic effect. (\n15)\nThe recommended dose is 120–240 mg/d. The lower dose can be used when Ginkgo is in a formula with other ingredients and/or mild/moderate complaints, and the higher dose is typically for standalone use and/or in people with dementia, Alzheimer’s, or significant neurodegenerative conditions.\nIt can take several months for its maximum benefit to occur. I recommend taking it for at least three months before determining whether it will help you.\nIf you do a deep dive on Gingko, you’ll find that the research on its efficacy is mixed, with some studies showing benefits and others not. This is almost certainly due to the fact that only Gingko extracts are effective. Many studies use the whole herb powder, which is not standardized and has low potency. Almost all of the studies using extracts show benefits.\nGingko does have some important contraindications to be aware of.\n- Mild blood thinning effect. This can result in an increased risk of bleeding when used concurrently with antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, Plavix), anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin (Coumadin®), or other agents that have a blood-thinning effect.\n- Interaction with SSRIs/antidepressants. Ginkgo acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). It inhibits the breakdown of monoamine oxidase, which breaks down dopamine. This leads to higher dopamine levels and explains why Ginkgo can reduce anxiety levels. However, combining MAOIs and SSRIs can significantly increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. This condition occurs when there is an excessive accumulation of serotonin in the body. It can lead to symptoms such as confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, fever, agitation, muscle rigidity, and in severe cases, seizures or unconsciousness. MAOIs and SSRIs affect the serotonin levels in the brain but in different ways. MAOIs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down serotonin, thereby increasing its levels, while SSRIs prevent the reuptake of serotonin back into the neurons, also increasing its levels. For these reasons, it is considered unsafe to take Ginkgo concurrently with SSRIs or other compounds that affect serotonin levels, like St. John’s Wort, BuSpar (buspirone), or even high doses of melatonin (>10 mg).\n- Interaction with seizure medications. A few reports have associated seizures with Ginkgo use in patients using medication used to lower seizure threshold. These drugs include propofol (Diprivan®), mexiletine (Mexitil®), amphotericin B (Fungizone®), penicillin, and a few others.\nGinkgo is safe and well-tolerated for most people. If you’re taking blood thinners, SSRIs or medications/herbs that affect serotonin levels, or drugs that lower seizure threshold, you should speak with your doctor before taking it.\nUridine Monophosphate: The Brain Energy Booster\nUridine monophosphate (UMP) is a nucleotide and building block for the synthesis of RNA and DNA in cells throughout the body, including in the brain. While our bodies can make some UMP, dietary sources like organ meats and brewer’s yeast are often lacking in the modern diet.\nThat’s where UMP supplements come in. Research suggests that boosting brain levels of uridine can enhance synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, and membrane function, leading to improved cognitive performance and mood. Several studies have found that UMP supplementation, especially when combined with omega-3 fatty acids and choline, can improve memory, verbal fluency, and overall mental function in both healthy adults and those with age-related cognitive decline. (\n16)\nUMP may also have neuroprotective and mood-supportive properties. Animal studies suggest that it can protect neurons from toxins and stress. At the same time, human research has found that it can alleviate depression, potentially by modulating dopamine neurotransmission. (\n17, 18)\nThere are two main ways to increase UMP levels with supplements. One is to take citicoline. Earlier in the show, I explained how citicoline is broken down into cytidine and choline in the gut. Cytidine can be converted into uridine by the cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTPS). This uridine then gets phosphorylated into uridine monophosphate (UMP).\nThe second, more direct way is to supplement with UMP itself. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and provides all the benefits we’ve discussed.\nUMP’s effects are increased when stacked with DHA and choline. DHA comprises 60% of the brain and is most prominent in the neurons’ phospholipid membrane. Combining DHA with UMP leads to a greater increase in synaptic phosphatides than either compound alone. Adding choline amplifies the effects even further. Citicoline is the preferred form because, as we’ve discussed, it will further increase UMP levels. Magnesium and B vitamins have also been shown to potentiate the action of UMP.\nAlpinia Galanga: The “Thai Ginger” for Mental Energy\nAlpinia galanga, also known as Thai ginger or galangal, is a medicinal herb in the ginger family used for centuries in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine to enhance cognitive function and physical endurance. The key active compound in Alpinia, known as 1’S-1′-Acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), has been shown to modulate brain pathways involved in alertness, attention, and mental energy. (\n19)\nWhile the research on Alpinia is still emerging, several clinical trials using a standardized extract called EnXtra have shown promising results for cognitive performance and mood. In one randomized, placebo-controlled study, a single dose of EnXtra significantly improved alertness, focus, and mental processing speed within one hour, with effects lasting up to five hours. (\n20) Another study found that EnXtra supplementation for 12 weeks led to improvements in attention, working memory, and overall cognitive function in healthy adults. ( 21)\nOne of Alpinia’s unique advantages is that it provides a clean, crash-free energy boost without the jitters or sleep disturbances often associated with caffeine. It can be taken alone or combined with other nootropics for synergistic effects.\nI prefer the patented enXtra ingredient as a source of Alpinia galangal. It’s a DNA-authenticated extract that is natural, clean-label, gluten-free (tested), and non-GMO. It’s supported by several peer-reviewed clinical studies.\nIt stacks well with caffeine, along with many of the nootropics we’ve discussed—more on this shortly.) And unlike caffeine, enXtra does not impact heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep, even at 2-4 times the recommended dose.\nBetter supplementation. Fewer supplements.\nClose the nutrient gap to feel and perform your best.\nA daily stack of supplements designed to meet your most critical needs.\nThe Bottom Line\nAs you can see, many safe, effective, and scientifically validated nootropics can help supercharge your brainpower, protect your cognitive health, and support a positive, resilient mood. By incorporating these cognitive enhancers into a nutrient-dense, whole-food diet and healthy lifestyle, you can take your mental performance to the next level and thrive in our fast-paced, ever-changing world.\nOf course, itʼs important to remember that everyoneʼs brain chemistry is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Some of these compounds, like bacopa and lion’s mane, may take several weeks of consistent use to build up in your system and deliver their full benefits.\nItʼs also crucial to source your nootropics wisely, opting for high-quality, clinically validated ingredients. The supplement industry is rife with low-quality products that may be contaminated, adulterated, or simply ineffective. Do your research, consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner, and choose brands that prioritize purity, potency, and transparency.\nFinally, donʼt forget that nootropics are meant to enhance, not replace, the foundations of brain health—good sleep, regular exercise, stress management, social connection, and lifelong learning. These fundamentals are still the most powerful tools for optimizing cognitive function and preventing age-related decline.\nThat said, for many people, the right combination of nootropics can provide a powerful brain boost and make it easier to show up as their best selves each day, both mentally and emotionally. Whether you’re a busy professional looking to enhance your productivity and creativity, a student seeking to optimize your learning and memory, or an older adult wanting to protect your cognitive vitality as you age, there’s a nootropic protocol that can help you reach your goals.\nIn a world that’s constantly demanding more of our mental energy and resilience, nootropics can be a game-changing tool for leveling up our cognitive capacity and emotional well-being. By taking a proactive, personalized approach to brain optimization, we can all tap into our innate potential and show up as the best versions of ourselves—at work, at home, and in every area of our lives. So here’s to sharpening our minds, uplifting our moods, and making the most of our magnificent brains!",

    "title": "Ron DeSantis vows big changes to K-12 and higher education if elected.",
    "text": "ANKENY, Iowa — Ron DeSantis railed against \"indoctrination\" in public schools and universities in a round-table discussion Thursday with conservative parents and school board members. DeSantis' battle against \"woke\" ideology has been a central theme throughout his presidential campaign. He reminds Iowa audiences about his leadership of Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he eventually opposed closures and mask mandates, and laws he signed to prohibit instruction on LGBTQ concepts or \"critical race theory\" in Florida schools.\n\"What's happening is, the left is hijacking other institutions in society to try to impose their agenda on the American people,\" DeSantis said, recalling his fight with Disney over one of Florida's controversial education laws.\nIn a one-on-one interview with the Des Moines Register, DeSantis declined to elaborate about what might be motivating Democrats or \"the left\" to teach kids about concepts such as gender ideology.\n\"I don't know what's motivating it, but obviously, I don't think that that's what we want in our education system,\" he said, calling for schools to focus on \"the basics.\"\nWhat is Ron DeSantis' stance on K-12 education? Lawmakers in both Iowa and Florida have focused intensely on education in recent years, with the rise of a \"parents' rights\" movement and conservatives' concerns over inappropriate materials in classrooms.\nReynolds and DeSantis each signed major bills this year to create and expand private school scholarship programs in their state.\nIf elected president, DeSantis said he plans to make private school vouchers available nationwide using corporate tax credits.\n\"It's actually improved all the different types of education,\" DeSantis said of the Florida law. \"Because school districts compete for students … and this has been something that has been very, very good.\"\nDeSantis pitches higher education changes to discourage diversity training and 'trendy' majors DeSantis proposed policies to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training and to discourage unprofitable degree programs at America's public universities.\nDEI has been a hot-button topic for conservatives for years, and DeSantis has led the pack . At Thursday's event, he said DEI is \"a cancer\" and has \"fueled some of the nasty antisemitism\" on college campuses as students respond to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nAs president, DeSantis promised to recognize more accreditation groups that do not require DEI training. That could allow a university to forgo DEI requirements while retaining its accreditation and ability to access federal funds.\nDeSantis also proposed making universities responsible for the debt of students who cannot pay back their loans , which he says will incentivize colleges to cut down on \"administrative bloat\" and unprofitable degree programs. When discussing the issue in his stump speech, DeSantis gives the interchangeable example of a gender studies or a \"zombie studies\" degree.\n\"And then what, they think the sea is going to part for them? It doesn't work that way,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether the change would hurt art or music programs, DeSantis said that \"classic liberal arts subjects\" can still succeed.\n\"Even like Wall Street (professionals), a lot of them took normal, liberal arts subjects, not necessarily business,\" he said. \"But I think there's a difference between those core subjects, which have been part of higher (education) for centuries, and some of the more trendy stuff which have not shown an ability to be lucrative in the private sector.\"\nWith weeks until the caucus, how is DeSantis doing in polls? DeSantis has a vigorous Iowa schedule ahead of the Jan. 15 caucus, including a New Year’s Eve party in West Des Moines.\nHe’s polling at a distant second place behind former President Donald Trump. In an early December Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Trump was the first choice candidate for 51% of likely Republican caucusgoers, while DeSantis won support from 19%.\nWhen asked what percentage he needs to win on Caucus Day, DeSantis said simply, \"We're gonna do very well.\"\n\"We're not stopping,\" he said. \"We want everybody to come out and we want them to caucus for us.\nSince the Register released that poll, DeSantis and his endorsers have told Iowa audiences that Trump's dominant lead in the polls is a false media narrative and part of a scheme to ultimately bolster President Joe Biden's reelection bid. He urged the attendees of Thursday's round table to support him on caucus night.\n\"The media thinks they should be able to pick without the voters even having a choice,\" he said. \"And I think there's a lot of Iowans that probably disagree with that.\"\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

    "text": "SAGINAW, Mich. (Gray News) - A Michigan police department sent out a final call to honor a trooper killed in the line of duty.\nThe Saginaw Police Department shared a video of Michigan State Trooper Joel Popp’s final call on Facebook Wednesday.\n“Your courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the man delivering the message is heard saying. “This is the end of watch for our brother, Tpr. Joel Popp, badge number 1779. Rest in peace, sir. We’ll take it from here.”\nPopp, 39, died on Jan. 24 after he was hit by a car during a traffic stop on Interstate 75.\nAccording to Michigan State Police, he and other troopers were investigating a suspected impaired driver stopped in a curved lane of traffic when a vehicle struck two patrol cars and Popp, who was outside of his car at the time.\nHe was taken to Hurley Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.\nJoel Popp is pictured with his wife, Stephanie, and his daughter. Popp was killed on Jan. 24 after he was struck by a car during a traffic stop. (Stefanie Popp) Popp enlisted with the Michigan State Police in January 2020. He is survived by his wife Stephanie and young daughter.\nLoved ones and colleagues gathered for Popp’s funeral service on Wednesday at the Saginaw Valley State University, according to WNEM .\nLt. Kimberly Vetter with the Michigan State Police said dozens of law enforcement partners came together at the service to honor him.\n“We’re a family and it’s difficult to lose a family member,” Vetter told WNEM. “We spend a lot of time together, we train together, and work together.”\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff on Thursday in acknowledgment of Popp’s service to the state.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Police call new license plate cameras around metro Detroit a 'game changer'",
    "text": "(WXYZ) — A new type of license plate reader cameras are being used across metro Detroit to apprehend criminals. \"They are just tracking license plates to give us leads in our investigations,\" said Taylor Police Chief John Blair. Since the beginning of this year, 50 of the cameras have been installed across Taylor and another 27 on patrol cars. Chief Blair says the cutting-edge technology has been a game changer. \"It gives us an advantage. Vehicles are used in more than 80 percent of crimes. We know criminals use those to facilitate their crimes, and if we can get the license plates, it's going to help catch them,\" he said. The city-funded camera system clocks in around 9 million license plate reads a month. \"This month in May we had 220+ vehicles that have been wanted. We have used Flock to solve all sorts of crime,\" he said. These cameras have also helped in the recovery of stolen vehicles. Body cam showed an officer receiving an alert from the Flock cameras about a stolen vehicle, and then, a traffic stop is made. As per Taylor police, since the installation of the Flock cameras, they are now recovering up to 10 stolen vehicles a month. \"If we want to do surveillance on somebody. If we knew what car they were coming in from, instead of running an entire team of 6-8 officers in cars, we can actually track that offender as they move from location to location,\" he said. But Joseph Holme, who frequently visits the city's Heritage Park, says this is the first time he has noticed the cameras and feels more needs to be done to create awareness. \"Like this guy here, he doesn't know that his license plate is being read even though it's for public safety, that I understand. The question is, what else can it be used for?\" asked Holme. Yes, with great power comes great responsibility. I met with Lt. Jeff Adamisin to get more information about the cameras. \"So, the plates are state owned, the plates and the vehicles are not protected, and this camera is only taking pictures of vehicles and the plate. It's not taking any pictures of drivers or passengers. It eliminates the right to privacy. Because as we are driving down the road, we are all able to see vehicles that are passing us,\" said Lt. Adamisin. Lt. Adamisin says the cameras are real-time and are also being used in other cities across metro Detroit. \"I have 6,300 different cameras throughout the United States,\" said Lt. Adamisin. He showed me this map of Flock cameras across the country and as you zoom in, there's Michigan and metro Detroit. \"You got to remember these vehicles traveling 45 to 50 miles an hour and their newest cameras are good for 100 miles an hour,\" he said. Moreover, the police can also use the technology to search for vehicles without a plate by just typing the car's description. ACLU's Liz Balck has been studying the Flock camera system. Balck says there are talks of a statewide statute; if passed, all law enforcement agencies will have to discard the collected data after the pre-determined timeframe. \"A policy that we would see is that Flock may not sell or share that data, even the government, except for limited situations like warrants or on-going investigations,\" said Balck. For people who are concerned about privacy, Lt. Adamisin says, \"Now that the information stored within this program is only kept for 30 days, so we are not sharing this information, Flock doesn't share this information.\" To learn more about the Flock system, [go here.](https://www.flocksafety.com/industries/law-enforcement)",
